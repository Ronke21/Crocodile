<text>Market risk is the risk of losses in positions arising from movements in market variables like prices and volatility.
There is no unique classification as each classification may refer to different aspects of market risk. Nevertheless, the most commonly used types of market risk are:
* &quot;Equity risk&quot;, the risk that stock or stock indices (e.g. Euro Stoxx 50, etc.) prices or their implied volatility will change.
* &quot;Interest rate risk&quot;, the risk that interest rates (e.g. Libor, Euribor, etc.) or their implied volatility will change.
* &quot;Currency risk&quot;, the risk that foreign exchange rates (e.g. EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, etc.) or their implied volatility will change.
* &quot;Commodity risk&quot;, the risk that commodity prices (e.g. corn, crude oil) or their implied volatility will change.
* &quot;Margining risk&quot; results from uncertain future cash outflows due to margin calls covering adverse value changes of a given position.
* &quot;Shape risk&quot;
* &quot;Holding period risk&quot;
* &quot;Basis risk&quot;

The capital requirement for market risk is addressed under a revised framework known as &quot;Fundamental Review of the Trading Book&quot; (FRTB).

==Risk management==
All businesses take risks based on two factors: the probability an adverse circumstance will come about and the cost of such adverse circumstance.
Risk management is then the study of how to control risks and balance the possibility of gains.
For a discussion of the practice of (market) risk management in banks, investment firms, and corporates more generally see .

==Measuring the potential loss amount due to market risk==
As with other forms of risk, the potential loss amount due to market risk may be measured in several ways or conventions. Traditionally, one convention is to use value at risk (VaR). The conventions of using VaR are well established and accepted in the short-term risk management practice.

However, VaR contains a number of limiting assumptions that constrain its accuracy. The first assumption is that the composition of the portfolio measured remains unchanged over the specified period. Over short time horizons, this limiting assumption is often regarded as reasonable. However, over longer time horizons, many of the positions in the portfolio may have been changed. The VaR of the unchanged portfolio is no longer relevant. Other problematic issues with VaR is that it is not sub-additive, and therefore not a coherent risk measure. As a result, other suggestions for measuring market risk is conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) that is coherent for general loss distributions, including discrete distributions and is sub-additive.

The variance covariance and historical simulation approach to calculating VaR assumes that historical correlations are stable and will not change in the future or breakdown under times of market stress. However these assumptions are inappropriate as during periods of high volatility and market turbulence, historical correlations tend to break down. Intuitively, this is evident during a financial crisis where all industry sectors experience a significant increase in correlations, as opposed to an upward trending market. This phenomenon is also known as asymmetric correlations or asymmetric dependence. Rather than using the historical simulation, Monte-Carlo simulations with well-specified multivariate models are an excellent alternative. For example, to improve the estimation of the variance-covariance matrix, one can generate a forecast of asset distributions via Monte-Carlo simulation based upon the Gaussian copula and well-specified marginals. Allowing the modelling process to allow for empirical characteristics in stock returns such as auto-regression, asymmetric volatility, skewness, and kurtosis is important. Not accounting for these attributes lead to severe estimation error in the correlation and variance-covariance that have negative biases (as much as 70% of the true values). Estimation of VaR or CVaR for large portfolios of assets using the variance-covariance matrix may be inappropriate if the underlying returns distributions exhibit asymmetric dependence. In such scenarios, vine copulas that allow for asymmetric dependence (e.g., Clayton, Rotated Gumbel) across portfolios of assets are most appropriate in the calculation of tail risk using VaR or CVaR.

Besides, care has to be taken regarding the intervening cash flow, embedded options, changes in floating rate interest rates of the financial positions in the portfolio. They cannot be ignored if their impact can be large.

==Regulatory views==
The Basel Committee set revised minimum capital requirements for market risk in January 2016.
These revisions, the &quot;Fundamental Review of the Trading Book&quot;, address deficiencies relating to the existing &quot;Internal models&quot; and &quot;Standardised approach&quot; for the calculation of market-risk capital, and in particular discuss the following:
* Boundary between the &quot;Trading book&quot; and the &quot;Banking book&quot;
* Use of value at risk vs. expected shortfall to measure of risk under stress
* The risk of market illiquidity

==Use in annual reports of U.S. corporations==

In the United States, a section on market risk is mandated by the SEC in all annual reports submitted on Form 10-K. The company must detail how its results may depend directly on financial markets. This is designed to show, for example, an investor who believes he is investing in a normal milk company, that the company is also carrying out non-dairy activities such as investing in complex derivatives or foreign exchange futures.

== Market risk for physical investments ==

Physical investments face market risks as well, for example real capital such as real estate can lose market value and cost components such as fuel costs can fluctuate with market prices. On the other hand, some investments in physical capital can reduce risk and the value of the risk reduction can be estimated with financial calculation methods, just as market risk in financial markets is estimated. For example energy efficiency investments, in addition to reducing fuel costs, reduce exposure fuel price risk. As less fuel is consumed, a smaller cost component is susceptible to fluctuations in fuel prices. The value of this risk reduction can be calculated using the Tuominen-Seppänen method and its value has been shown to be approximately 10% compared to direct cost savings for a typical energy efficient building.

<doc id="337998" wikidata="Q1586862" url="?curid=337998" title="Spotted towhee">
<text>The spotted towhee (Pipilo maculatus) is a large New World sparrow. The taxonomy of the towhees has been debated in recent decades, and until 1995 this bird and the eastern towhee were considered a single species, the rufous-sided towhee. Another outdated name for the spotted towhee is the Oregon towhee (&quot;Pipilo maculatus oregonus&quot;). The call may be harsher and more varied than for the eastern towhee.

Individuals in the Socorro Island population are much smaller than other spotted towhees, and show distinctive gray upper-parts. That population is sometimes treated as a species: the Socorro towhee (&quot;Pipilo socorroensis&quot;).

==Description==
 The spotted towhee is a large New World sparrow, roughly the same size as a robin. It has a long, dark, fan-shaped tail with white corners on the end. It has a round body (similar to New World sparrows) with bright red eyes and dull pink legs. The spotted towhee is between and long, and weighs in at between and . It has a wingspan of 11.0 in (28 cm).

Adult males have a generally darker head, upper body and tail with a white belly, rufous sides, white spots on their back and white wing bars. Females look similar but are dark brown and grey instead of black. The spotted towhee has white spots on its primary and secondary feathers; the Eastern towhee is the same bird in terms of its size and structure but does not have white spots.

==Distribution and habitat==
The spotted towhee lives in dry upland forests, open forests, brushy fields, and chaparrals. It breeds across north-western North America and is present year-round in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and southern British Columbia. It is not found in arid climates and as a result does not reside in the Sonoran Desert, but resides in northern Arizona and the entirety of California except the southeast corner that borders Arizona. It has also been known to expand as far eastward as western Iowa and southwestern Minnesota. It also occurs in fringe wetland forests and riparian forests near the border of upland forests. Because the spotted towhee&#x27;s habitat overlaps with areas of the United States that experience regular forest fires (Arizona, New Mexico, California), it tends to be found in unburned chaparral and avoids chaparral and forests which have been burned due to lack of ground cover and minimal foraging ability. Spotted towhees will be present in an area that is recovering after a burn (less than 15 years old), due to excellent ground cover and ease of ground foraging from the recovering understory vegetation, although populations will decrease after a forest fire until the vegetation has grown back.

Its breeding habitat in the southwest is largely dependent on coastal sage scrub, as it provides cover from predators. It migrates to northern and northwestern United States and southwestern Canada to breed in scrubland, parks and suburban gardens. Northwestern birds migrate eastwards to the central plains of the United States, mostly the northwestern-central Great Plains. In other areas, some birds may move to lower elevations in the winter. Their breeding habitat is chaparral, thickets or shrubby areas across western North America. This bird interbreeds with the collared towhee where their ranges overlap in southwestern Mexico.

==Behavior==
===Breeding and nesting===
 They nest either on the ground or low in bushes, seldom more than above the ground and most nests are around above the ground. The location for the nests is usually found in exposed areas, but conceal the nest as it is being built. The female builds the nest over a period of about five days. It is bulky and sturdily made of leaves, strips of bark, twigs, forb stalks, and grasses, lined with pine needles, shredded bark, grass, and sometimes hair. It is usually in diameter with an inner ring of to . The nests are built so the rim is at ground level and the nest is deep.

At least two broods, consisting of three to five eggs, are laid per season. The egg shells are grayish or creamy-white, sometimes with a tinge of green, with reddish brown spots that can form a wreath or cap. The eggs are slightly oblong, with their dimensions being to long and to wide. The female incubates the eggs alone for 12 to 14 days; the young leave the nest at 10 to 12 days. Nests are parasitized by cowbirds.

===Diet===
These birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, with a habit of noisily rummaging through dry leaves searching for food. During the breeding season (spring and summer) they mainly eat insects, ground dwelling beetles, spiders and other arthropods that reside in the leaf litter that is foraged by the spotted towhee. They only eat protein rich food in the breeding season, and in the fall and winter they focus on foraging for acorns, seeds, oats, and berries. They will frequent bird feeders if present in their woodland habitat.

===Threats===
Their main predators in less developed areas are ground dwelling snakes because nests are built on the ground. There is a strong relationship between the number of snakes that a nest encounters and the lowered probability of young chicks fledgling. In developed areas and habitat near urban development their main predators are household cats.

<text>The Secret of Sarek (L&#x27;Île aux trente cercueils / The Island of Thirty Coffins) is a French novel by Maurice Leblanc, 1919, also known for the film version as a mini-series in 1979 starring Claude Jade as Véronique. 

The action begins in France in 1917. The heroine of the story is Véronique d&#x27;Hergemont. In 1903, her father, Professor Antoine d&#x27;Hergemont, kidnapped her baby and it was later reported by news outlets that they both had drowned in the sea.It was her father&#x27;s revenge on Véronique&#x27;s marriage to Count Vorski. While watching a film, Véronique spots her childhood signature &quot;V d&#x27;H&quot; mysteriously written on the side of a hut in the background of a scene. Her visit to the location of the film shoot deepens the mystery, but also provides further clues that point her towards long-lost relations and a great secret from ancient history: She finds a prophecy: &quot;Four women on the cross, stone of God that gives life or death. Thirty sacrifices for thirty coffins&quot;. When Véronique arrives on the island of Sarek, the prophecy comes true. Many people die horrific deaths and Véronique also ends up in a torture chamber. She faces the sinister forces. It is a secret that will require the services of a particular man, to unravel.

== TV series ==
In 1979 a successful TV series &quot;L&#x27;Île aux trente cercueils&quot; was released. Claude Jade plays the leading role as Véronique.

Director: Marcel Cravenne
===Cast===
*Claude Jade (Véronqiue d&#x27;Hergemont)
*Jean-Paul Zehnacker (Vorski)
*Yves Beneyton (Maroux)
*Pascal Sellier (Francois / Eric)
*Julie Philippe (Elfride)
*Georges Marchal (Antoine d&#x27;Hergemont)
*Marie Mergey (Honorine)

In the mini-series, the figure of Arsène Lupin, who appears at the end like deus ex machina, does not exist. So Véronique can solve the mystery alone with the help of a friend. In the TV version, the villains Elfride and Vorski die at the end: Elfride stabs and Vorski and shoots himself. Then Véronique can leave the island accompanied by two other characters and the dog Aramis.

<text>The Shield is an American crime drama television series starring Michael Chiklis that premiered on March 12, 2002, on FX in the United States, and concluded on November 25, 2008, after seven seasons. Known for its portrayal of corrupt police officers, it was originally advertised as &quot;Rampart&quot; in reference to the true-life Rampart Division police scandal, on which the show&#x27;s Strike Team was loosely based. The series was created by Shawn Ryan and The Barn Productions for Fox Television Studios and Sony Pictures Television.

Several notable actors took extended roles on the show, including Glenn Close, who was the female lead during the fourth season; Michael Peña, in season 4; Anthony Anderson, in seasons 4, 5, and 6; Forest Whitaker, who guest-starred in seasons 5 and 6; Laura Harring, in season 5; Franka Potente, in season 6; and Laurie Holden, in season 7.

The series has received critical acclaim and is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time. 

==Premise==
&quot;The Shield&quot; follows the activities of an experimental division of the Los Angeles Police Department set up in the fictional Farmington district (&quot;the Farm&quot;) of Los Angeles, a district rife with gang-related violence, drug trafficking, and prostitution. Operating out of a converted church (&quot;the Barn&quot;), they work to maintain the peace in the district and reduce crime.

At the center of the division is the Strike Team, led by Detectives Vic Mackey, Shane Vendrell, Curtis Lemansky, and Ronnie Gardocki. Mackey and the Strike Team use criminal methods to coerce information and stage arrests and take a share of various drug busts. Although the Strike Team&#x27;s questionably high success rate leaves the division&#x27;s head, Captain David Aceveda, suspicious of their methods, he values their success as they help his political efforts to become mayor of Los Angeles.

Attempts to place a fifth member on the Strike Team not in Mackey&#x27;s circle go astray. The pilot episode concludes with Mackey, suspicious of the loyalty of the latest Strike Team recruit, Terry Crowley, fatally shooting him during an arrest and framing their suspect. This sets in motion events that loom over the Strike Team and continue throughout the series.

The show has an ensemble cast featuring the other officers in the Farmington district. This includes detectives Holland &quot;Dutch&quot; Wagenbach, Steve Billings and Claudette Wyms, uniformed officers Sgt. Danielle &quot;Danny&quot; Sofer, Julien Lowe, and Tina Hanlon. The series has a variety of subplots, notably Aceveda&#x27;s political aspirations and his suffering a sexual assault; Mackey&#x27;s struggle to cope with a failing marriage, two autistic children, and rebellious eldest daughter; Danny becoming a mother; Vendrell&#x27;s rocky, new marriage; Lemansky&#x27;s growing fear for the safety of the Strike Team; Claudette&#x27;s battle with illness and Lowe&#x27;s internal conflicts between his Christian beliefs and his homosexuality.

&quot;The Shield&quot; and the Strike Team were inspired by the Rampart Division Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) unit within the Los Angeles Police Department. &quot;Rampart&quot; was seriously considered as the series&#x27; name and was even used in some early promotional ads for the series.

Characters are portrayed with vices and virtues; Vic&#x27;s loving relationship with his children contrasts with his thuggish approach to police work. Two of the many examples of Mackey&#x27;s criminal and sociopathic behavior include an attempt to rob the &quot;Armenian Money Train&quot;, a money laundering operation of the Armenian Mafia in season 2 and having a police dog maul a rape suspect.

The timeline of the seven seasons of the show covers approximately three years.

==Series overview==

===Season 1===
Season 1 premiered on March 12, 2002, and concluded on June 4, 2002, consisting of 13 episodes. The season deals with Mackey and Vendrell covering up their shooting of Terry Crowley, a plant on the Strike Team placed by David Aceveda and the Department of Justice who have been suspicious of the Strike Team&#x27;s activities. Dutch believes a serial killer is targeting prostitutes. Lowe struggles with his sexual orientation and his Christian morals making him a target for blackmail. Sofer, who is having an affair with Mackey, finds herself both concerned and frustrated while training Lowe.

===Season 2===
Season 2 premiered on January 7, 2003, and concluded April 1, 2003, consisting of 13 episodes. The first half of the season deals with a new drug threat from Armadillo, a highly intelligent immigrant who has coerced the black and Hispanic gangs to work together, making it difficult for the Strike Team to charge him. The second half of the season deals with the Strike Team&#x27;s discovery of the Armenian &quot;money train&quot; used to ship laundered money out of the United States. Mackey and the Strike Team successfully hijack the shipment, ending up with millions of dollars for themselves. Aceveda makes an agreement with Mackey to protect each other while Aceveda runs for city council. Claudette, whose own investigation into Armadillo is hampered by Mackey and Aceveda, is forced out of her passive role and prepares to take an active role as a moral leader. Dutch makes a major mistake in an investigation and begins second guessing himself. Lowe gets married but nearly gets outed to the department by a former lover. Sofer finds herself becoming a pawn in Barn politics and begins to question the Strike Team&#x27;s ethics.

===Season 3===
Season 3 premiered on March 9, 2004, and concluded on June 15, 2004, consisting of 15 episodes. The season deals with fallout from the money train robbery. Mackey learns that a portion of the money was marked by the Treasury Department, and the Strike Team figures out ways of diverting any federal attention to their activities. However, the tension of having the money gets to Lemansky, and in an off-the-cuff decision, burns most of the money before the others can stop him. This leads to the dissolution of the Strike Team. Dutch struggles to find balance while looking into both the money train robbery and a serial rapist. Claudette begins administrative duties in preparation to take over as Captain but her qualms over a potentially incompetent defense attorney put her career in jeopardy. After the fallout of nearly being outed in the previous season, Lowe starts taking on a tougher demeanor making Claudette question his future.

===Season 4===
Season 4 premiered on March 15, 2005, and concluded on June 14, 2005, consisting of 13 episodes. During this season, the members of the Strike Team become involved with the affairs of Antwon Mitchell, a highly respected drug lord who ends up blackmailing Vendrell to coerce his help. Mackey, with the help of the new Barn Captain, Monica Rawling, manages to help Vendrell out of his situation, reunites the Strike Team, and eventually ends up with sufficient evidence to send Mitchell to jail. However, Rawling finds herself dismissed as Captain due to her approach of seizing any assets tied to drug money. Claudette and Dutch continue to be shut out of meaningful cases by the DA&#x27;s office, forcing Dutch to make a backroom deal to save his and Claudette&#x27;s careers. A rift forms between Lowe and Sofer over the seizures policy. Aceveda uses the seizures policy to get more power on the city council and ultimately push his own agenda.

===Season 5===
Season 5 premiered on January 10, 2006, and concluded on March 21, 2006, consisting of 11 episodes. The LAPD&#x27;s Internal Affairs Division opens an investigation led by Lt. Jon Kavanaugh against Lemansky, purportedly for not reporting a stash of drugs he had taken, but in actuality to find evidence of the Strike Team&#x27;s misdeeds. Mackey learns of Kavanaugh&#x27;s true intent, and tries to humiliate Kavanaugh to show the investigation is personal. Enraged, Kavanaugh puts on more pressure and charges Lemansky. The Strike Team attempts to smuggle Lemansky out of the country, but Vendrell, fearing Lemansky will talk, kills him with a grenade, ending the investigation. Lowe trains Tina Hanlon but quickly believes she may not be cut out for the job. Dutch and Claudette focus on the serial killer they have no evidence against while it becomes clear Claudette&#x27;s health is deteriorating. Billings&#x27; weak management coupled with Kavanaugh&#x27;s strong-arm tactics force the LAPD chief to name a stronger and more independent Captain to the Barn, Claudette.

====&quot;Wins and Losses&quot;====
The producers of &quot;The Shield&quot; produced a 15-minute &quot;promosode&quot;, which premiered on Google Video on February 15, 2007, to bridge the gap between seasons 5 and 6. The episode focuses on the aftermath of Lemanksky&#x27;s death, including his funeral and flashbacks as co-workers reflect upon his life. The episode was said to have cost between $500,000 and $1 million to produce. It was on bud.tv for four weeks and later released to AOL and other media outlets. The &quot;promosode&quot; is also one of the special features included on the season 5 DVD set.

===Season 6===
Season 6 premiered on April 3, 2007, and concluded on June 5, 2007, consisting of 10 episodes. The Strike Team struggles with Lemansky&#x27;s death, and suspect one of the gangs committed it, while Vendrell remains quiet regarding his role. Kavanaugh continues his investigation outside of Internal Affairs, but is eventually forced to admit to planting evidence and is arrested. Mackey learns he is being forced into early retirement and tries to fight back by proving his value. Tensions on the Strike Team led Vendrell to admit to killing Lemansky, and knowing that Mackey will likely kill him, he turns to the Armenian mob for protection, only to expose the team&#x27;s role in the money-train heist, putting their families at risk. Vendrell writes up all their crimes and mails duplicates to use as blackmail against Mackey. Claudette fights to keep the Barn from being shut down. Dutch tries to adjust to his new partnership with Billings and his crush on Hanlon. Sofer, recently promoted to Sergeant, tries to find balance being a working single mother. Lowe joins the Strike Team now under the command of Kevin Hiatt. Aceveda finds a strong financial backer who may be too good to be true.

Season 6 was originally intended to be aired as the second half of season 5, but FX decided to refer to these 10 episodes as season 6 instead.

===Season 7===
Season 7 premiered on September 2, 2008, and concluded on November 25, 2008, consisting of 13 episodes. Mackey and Aceveda discover the Mexican cartel is looking to influence Farmington, and work with ICE to take them down. Mackey also uses the opportunity to secure a position at ICE in exchange for immunity for his crimes on the Strike Team. The Barn gains significant evidence to arrest the Strike Team. Vendrell attempts to kill Mackey, but it goes awry, making him and his family fugitives. With no hold over Mackey, he kills himself and his family. Mackey successfully busts the cartel for ICE, but betrays Gardocki, who is arrested for the Strike Team&#x27;s crimes. Dutch focuses on a kid he is certain will become a serial killer. Sofer attempts to keep Mackey out of their son&#x27;s life. Corrine, scared when she finally realizes everything Vic is, takes her children into federal witness protection. Claudette and Dutch make one final attempt to get evidence to arrest Mackey, but he is shielded by his deal with ICE; however, Vic then learns that he will be required to work as a desk analyst at ICE, with no official power or responsibilities. The series ends as Mackey, hearing sirens in the distance, holsters his gun (which he was supposed to surrender as a condition of his deal) and walks out, his destination unknown.

==Cast and characters==

* Michael Chiklis as Vic Mackey – a corrupt police officer and for much of the series, leader of the Strike Team. Though effective at apprehending criminals, he has no qualms about using illegal or unethical methods, which include beating and torturing suspects, and planting evidence, tactics he regards as a means to an end. Mackey has committed several murders, including that of a police officer, Terry Crowley, which haunts him thereafter. He is perennially under investigation by his superiors, but the Machiavellian Mackey always eludes them; also, on occasions, they turn a blind eye to his tactics when they need him to crack a high-profile case. Mackey&#x27;s marriage to Corinne, a nurse, failed because of his numerous infidelities (including with Officer Sofer, which resulted in a child). He and Corinne have three children, two with autism, which puts more strain on him. By Season 7, Mackey is effectively forced out of the LAPD. He cuts an immunity deal with ICE in return for confessing all his crimes, including Crowley&#x27;s murder, implicating Shane Vendrell and Ronnie Gardocki. Mackey discovers that Corinne and the children have disappeared into the Witness Protection Program while, to his horror, his new job at ICE is to write reports. Though safe from prosecution, Mackey has lost his family and best friends and is now ostracized by his colleagues; the final scene shows him walking out into the streets alone.
* Catherine Dent as Danielle &quot;Danny&quot; Sofer – a patrol officer who aspires to become a detective. She has an on-again-off-again sexual relationship with Vic and complicated history with Dutch. She is assigned desk duty as a result of her pregnancy and takes maternity leave after the birth of her son, Lee. The identity of the father was initially unknown; later, in the sixth-season episode &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot;, it was learned that it was Vic. Shortly afterward, Danny returned from maternity leave early so that she could take the position of Sergeant at the Barn. In Season Seven Vic threatens to force Danny to take a paternity test.
* Reed Diamond as Terry Crowley (season 1; guest: season 2) – an honest, fair, effective, and well-liked detective from the Robbery Division. When the Barn started operating, Aceveda brought Terry in to join the Strike Team to serve as a possible replacement for Vic if he failed as leader of the team. For some time, Terry was the Strike Team&#x27;s driver. After realizing that his colleagues are all dirty, Terry approached Aceveda who asked him to spy on Vic and the team so that they may build a case against them. After delivering the usual news to Aceveda, Aceveda called an associate from the Justice Department and they asked Terry to testify against the team, in exchange Terry receives a higher-paid job in Washington, D.C., and other expenses. However, Vic learned (off-screen) about the deal through his mentor Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy. After Terry asks Vic to be involved in the team&#x27;s big busts, he and the rest plan to raid the home of a drug dealer. During the raid, Vic takes the drug dealer&#x27;s gun and shoots Terry in the face, killing him.
* Walton Goggins as Shane Vendrell – Vic Mackey&#x27;s best friend and partner before the Strike Team was formed. He has a reckless streak, and his attempts to emulate Mackey&#x27;s dealings quite often take a bad turn. Throughout the series, he meets and marries Mara, who later bears him a son, Jackson. When it appears that Lem has turned on the Strike Team, Vendrell kills him by dropping a grenade into his car. The ensuing guilt and grief force him to become reckless and suicidal, and when Mackey uncovers the truth, their friendship ends. Vendrell grows to regret his actions as part of the Strike Team and expresses great remorse for what he has become. When it is revealed that he blackmailed someone to kill Ronnie Gardocki in retaliation for Mackey and Gardocki&#x27;s attempt to kill him, Vendrell goes on the run with his wife and son. However, Mackey&#x27;s immunity deal with ICE ends Vendrell&#x27;s hopes of sparing himself and Mara from long prison sentences by testifying against Mackey: Vendrell therefore, poisons his son and pregnant wife and then kills himself. His suicide note, and photos of his family&#x27;s corpses are shown to Vic by Claudette in a last-ditch effort to taunt him.
* Michael Jace as Julien Lowe – a uniformed officer who is partnered with Sofer for the majority of the series. During the formation of a new Strike Team, Claudette offered Julien to Kevin Hiatt as a possible addition to the team. Claudette made the offer to Julien, who was hesitant, mainly because of the thought of being partnered with Vic on a daily basis. After being assured that Mackey was going to be moved out of the team, Julien accepted the promotion. Despite his desire to become a fully functioning member of the Strike Team, Julien knew that he was on the outside of the clique. When the Strike Team is dissolved for the final time, he becomes a uniformed officer again. He is asked to choose which side he will be on when Claudette finally has a case to go after Mackey and Vendrell. A recurring plotline for Lowe is the conflict between his Christian beliefs and his homosexual desires.
* Kenny Johnson as Curtis Lemansky (seasons 1–5) – a cop with a conscience and an original member of the Strike Team. He has a history of working with kids and maintaining a soft spot for them. His loyalty to Vic Mackey and the Strike Team led him to go along with most of their illegal schemes, although he did not know about all of them, such as the murder of Terry Crowley. He burned most of the money from the Armenian Money Train robbery to keep the team from getting caught. Burning the money caused a temporary split within the team, although they later got back together. Shane Vendrell kills Lemansky in the Season 5 finale, under the mistaken impression that Lemansky was going to rat on the rest of the team. Lem was unmarried and had no children.
* Jay Karnes as Holland &quot;Dutch&quot; Wagenbach – a persistent and successful police detective, but is regarded as a pompous and socially inept nerd. He is often the butt of jokes at the Barn, particularly from Mackey. Along with his partner, Claudette Wyms, Dutch is the moral center of the show as a clean cop who does not engage in illegal activities. He shares a close friendship with Claudette and shows genuine concern for her after learning of her lupus diagnosis. Dutch is usually the first called to investigate violent crimes because he specializes in criminal profiling and serial killers. In Season 1 he receives an impromptu round of applause from everyone at the Barn, including Vic, after he painstakingly proves the guilt of a suspected serial killer. Later, he is seen strangling a live cat after questioning an actual serial killer about what he sees in his victims&#x27; eyes. Dutch is unsuccessful with women, but he does have several fleeting romances, including with Danny Sofer, and tries to ask out Tina Hanlon. He embarks on a seemingly vengeful relationship with Vic&#x27;s ex-wife, which caused even more friction with Vic and leads to Dutch challenging him to a fight. Dutch&#x27;s investigation into the Armenian money train heist and his suspicions that the Strike Team was involved eventually brought about the quartet&#x27;s downfall.
* Benito Martinez as David Aceveda – a politically ambitious man who was the captain of the Barn from seasons one to three. He was then elected to the Los Angeles City Council and had ambitions to become Mayor. He is one of Vic Mackey&#x27;s main rivals, although on occasions they forged uneasy alliances for their mutual benefit. In Season 3, Aceveda was orally raped at gunpoint by two gang members. He tracked down and killed one of his assailants, and struck a deal with drug lord Antwon Mitchell to have the other killed in prison. During the final season, Aceveda and Mackey worked together to bring down Cruz Pezuela, a corrupt businessman who initially bankrolled Aceveda&#x27;s mayoral campaign and then tried to blackmail him with photographs of his sexual assault, before switching their target to Beltran, a cartel enforcer. At the series&#x27; close, Aceveda looked set to become Los Angeles&#x27; next mayor after taking credit for Beltran&#x27;s arrest.
* CCH Pounder as Claudette Wyms – a veteran detective. Claudette, along with her partner Dutch, can be viewed as the voice of morality at the Barn; as a result, she is often at odds with Vic over his tactics. It emerges that Claudette has suffered from lupus for fifteen years and resents Dutch&#x27;s subsequent over-protectiveness of her. Against the orders of her superiors, Claudette reopened cases overseen by a compromised public defender, which cost her promotion to captain. She eventually got the job in season 5. As Captain, she did her best to marginalize Mackey and was determined to gather enough evidence to indict him. She was left furious upon discovering Mackey&#x27;s generous immunity deal with the ICE. During the final season, her lupus returned and began to interfere with her ability to do her job. In the final episode, she admitted to Dutch that her illness is terminal. Despite being unable to prosecute Mackey, Claudette ultimately reveals Shane&#x27;s suicide note to Vic and also orders Ronnie&#x27;s arrest in front of him.
* Cathy Cahlin Ryan as Corrine Mackey (main: seasons 5–7; recurring: seasons 1–3; also starring: season 4) – was once married to Vic Mackey and had three children with him, two of whom have autism. She works as a nurse and once had a brief courtship with Dutch. Despite needing Vic in her life, she eventually turns on him and helps Dutch and Claudette build a case to send Vic behind bars. She is moved to witness protection by ICE to keep her and her children away from Vic, fearing that he may try to harm her if he finds out she has collaborated with the police.
* David Rees Snell as Ronnie Gardocki (main: seasons 5–7; recurring: seasons 1–3; also starring: season 4) – the Strike Team&#x27;s surveillance and electronics expert. Though little is known about Ronnie, he has proven to be the most solid, emotionally stable member of the Strike Team and has remained loyal to Vic out of enlightened self-interest, knowing that divisions between them would only lead to bad ends for both. The scars on his face, given to him by Armadillo in season 2, are proof of his loyalty to the team. In the final season, he becomes the official leader of the Strike Team. He was especially angry when he learned that Shane murdered Lem, and uneasy about working with Shane again. He and Vic concoct a plan to have the Mexicans kill Shane along with the Armenians that knew about the Money Train robbery. Shane survives and hires a pimp to kill Ronnie, which also fails. When Shane flees after being implicated, Claudette disbands the Strike Team, forcing Ronnie to become a &quot;suit and tie&quot; detective while trying to help Vic and stay out of prison. Vic makes an immunity deal with ICE in return for confessing all the Strike Team&#x27;s crimes, and lies to Ronnie that he has been granted the same deal. Ronnie only discovers Vic&#x27;s betrayal when he is arrested in the final episode and is led away, cursing Vic.
* Glenn Close as Monica Rawling (season 4) – the appointed Captain at the Barn who took over from Aceveda, after Claudette was rejected. She implemented several changes, such as fixing the Barn&#x27;s male toilets and, more importantly, creating seizure policies which proved to be somewhat controversial. She had a longstanding hatred of gang leader Antwon Mitchell and was suspicious of Mackey, even having him and his team investigated. She finds out that Shane was solicited by Mitchell to kill Vic. She is fired after she embarrasses the DEA by voiding the immunity deal they granted Mitchell (by getting the Strike Team to catch a Salvadoran cartel leader before Mitchell&#x27;s information could), and the feds threaten to cut off all federal highway funding to Los Angeles if Rawling stayed. She is mentioned, but not seen in subsequent seasons.
* David Marciano as Steve Billings (main: season 7; recurring: seasons 4–6) – a slack, somewhat cowardly detective who was made acting Captain after the departure of Rawling and later replaced by Claudette. Billings has an uneasy working relationship with Dutch, who dislikes his nonchalant attitude to the job. He and Dutch were partnered together after Claudette&#x27;s promotion, which prompted Dutch to request a transfer, which was rejected. When he puts his mind to it, Billings is shown to be a competent detective, but he is mostly known for his schemes, such as bringing his own vending machines into the Barn. He usually brings Dutch in on his plots and the two have come to blows on at least one occasion. After being injured during a brawl between Kavanaugh and Vic, he tries to sue the department for $2 million, although he settles for two days&#x27; backpay.
* Paula Garcés as Tina Hanlon (main: season 7; recurring: seasons 5–6) – a recruit at the barn, who is trained by Julien. She is very attractive and well aware of her sexuality, which often earns her the ire of Danny Sofer. Tina&#x27;s constant mistakes would have seen her out of the force had it not been for a bungle in which Billings while trying to see who was stealing from his vending machines, obtained photos of her changing clothes. He involved Dutch and, to protect her old partner, Claudette allowed Tina to remain on the force under Dutch&#x27;s supervision. She left the Barn after being made a spokesperson for the police force, but opted to transfer back. She had a sexual tryst with Kevin Hiatt, which was organized by Billings, although she later expressed regret and said that Dutch always had a chance with her, only he never took it. The day on which Shane Vendrell killed himself was her first anniversary as an officer, and although he was harsh on her at times, Julien celebrates by buying her a cake and throwing her a little party.

;Notes
==Development==
The series was created by Shawn Ryan. Ryan served as an executive producer for all seven seasons and was the series head writer and showrunner throughout its run. Prior to creating the series Ryan had been working as a producer and writer for the supernatural detective series &quot;Angel&quot;. He began his television career as a writer for the crime drama &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; was a more up-beat show, and Ryan was required to write scripts that showed the hero succeeding in a positive way, and Ryan sought to write something far different to get that out of his system. He had considered what a cop drama would be like on a premium cable network like HBO and Showtime, taking into account the edge that shows like &quot;&quot; and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; had brought to the genre. While trying to decide a direction, the Rampart scandal within the LAPD was exposed, and Ryan took inspiration from those events to craft out a pilot script. He also recently became a father, and wrote into the script his concerns about raising a child in a crime-ridden world. The pilot script had ended with Mackey shooting Crowley; Ryan had the idea of an alternate ending to &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, of where Al Pacino&#x27;s mobster character would have shot Johnny Depp&#x27;s undercover FBI character, revealing that the mobster had known his identity all along. He used this ending idea in the pilot for &quot;The Shield&quot;, not expecting to have to worry about any consequences as he was not sure the script would be picked up. Ryan later commented in 2017 that if he had known how long &quot;The Shield&quot; would have run for, he would have had a few more episodes to help establish Crowley&#x27;s character before having Mackey kill him off.

Around 2000, the FX network was looking to find what would be the network&#x27;s first drama series to help set the tone for their network, given the ongoing success of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; on rival network HBO. FX&#x27;s Kevin Reilly wanted a show about an antihero but believed that the cop genre had become tired. However, Reilly was amazed by Ryan&#x27;s script, and greenlit the show in mid-2001. Reilly worked with Ryan to help determine how much violence and nudity could be used within the show, as unlike HBO, FX was an ad-sponsored cable channel and beholden to certain content considerations. As they were working towards this, the September 11 attacks occurred, and in their aftermath, Fox was concerned if the show would be appropriate at this time, believing that audiences would not be receptive to seeing police officers portrayed in a negative light. The situation changed following the theatrical release of &quot;Training Day&quot; in October 2001, a film centered around corrupt cops that was a financial success. Fox was assured by &quot;Training Day&quot;″s reception from audiences that &quot;The Shield&quot; was allowed to continue, with the pilot first broadcast in March 2002.

Ryan had written the part of Mackey for someone with a young Harrison Ford personality. Due to the complexities of the character, he was uncertain they would have found a suitable actor for the role, and cast his own doubt on his writing. During casting, Ryan had been surprised with Michael Chiklis&#x27;s audition. Chiklis had gained a soft reputation within Hollywood based on his roles from &quot;The Commish&quot; and &quot;Daddio&quot;, and felt that he needed to have a change of pace in future roles, as he was finding himself cast for older, overweight parts. Chiklis spent six months away from acting and losing a significant amount of weight, and for his audition on &quot;The Shield&quot;, had shaved his head. Ryan was taken by this new appearance feeling it was not appropriate, but found that Chiklis had a certain charisma in his delivery that worked well into the Mackey character. This allowed Ryan to write Mackey as a compassionate figure, able to get away with certain improper actions through his charisma, which served to draw fans to sympathize with Mackey throughout the series. Ryan recognized that with Chiklis as his star, it validated his success as a writer.

Scott Brazil was a co-executive producer for the first season. He became an executive producer for the second season. He was a regular director for the series until his death during production of the sixth season. Brazil and Ryan had worked together on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;.

Several of the series more junior writers became executive producers during its run. Glen Mazzara was an executive story editor for the first season and became an executive producer from the fifth season onwards. Mazzara had also worked with Ryan on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. Kurt Sutter and Scott Rosenbaum were staff writers for the first season and became executive producers for the sixth season onwards. Adam E. Fierro joined the crew as a co-producer and writer for the third season and was promoted to executive producer for the seventh season. Veteran television writer Charles H. Eglee joined the crew as a consulting producer for the third season and was promoted to executive producer from the fifth season onwards.

James Manos Jr. served as a consulting producer and writer for the first two seasons. He left the show to develop the Showtime serial killer drama &quot;Dexter&quot;. &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; veteran writer Kevin Arkadie was a co-executive producer for the first season only. &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; writer and producer Reed Steiner replaced Arkadie as co-executive producer for the second season only. Kevin G. Cremin was the series unit production manager throughout its run and became a co-executive producer from the sixth season onwards.

&quot;Angel&quot; writing team Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain joined the crew as co-producers for the third season and became supervising producers before leaving at the close of the sixth season. Dean White was a producer and regular director throughout the series run. Chiklis became a producer from the second season onward and also regularly directed episodes. Post-production supervisor Craig Yahata joined the crew in the third season and eventually became a producer for the seventh season.

The series pilot and finale were directed by Clark Johnson; Johnson had previously starred in &quot;&quot; and made his directing debut on that series. Guy Ferland directed episodes for all seven seasons of &quot;The Shield&quot;. Rohn Schmidt was a cinematographer for all seven seasons and made his television directing debut on the show. Stephen Kay was a frequent director for the series. Gwyneth Horder-Payton was an assistant director for the show&#x27;s early seasons and made her television directing debut in the fourth season, she continued to regularly direct episodes thereafter.

Film director Frank Darabont directed an episode for the series. Darabont later reunited with several writers from &quot;The Shield&quot; for his television adaptation of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; comics, including Charles H. Eglee, Glen Mazzara and Adam Fierro. Acclaimed playwright and film writer and director David Mamet directed an episode of the series. Mamet and Ryan collaborated as executive producers on military thriller &quot;The Unit&quot;. Screenwriter Ted Griffin wrote a single episode of the show. Griffin later created &quot;Terriers&quot; and was reunited with Shawn Ryan as a fellow executive producer.

==Reception==
&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s James Poniewozik ranked &quot;The Shield&quot; #8 in his list of the Top 10 Returning Series of 2007 and later included it in his list of the top 100 greatest TV shows of all time. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the 8th-best TV show of the 2000s, saying, &quot;Det. Vic Mackey didn&#x27;t just clean up the streets—he cleaned up on the streets. Would he pay for those sins? This gutsy TV drama kept us guessing.&quot; On the review aggregator website Metacritic, season 1 received high acclaim from critics, with a score of 92 out of 100, based on 28 reviews. Season 7 also received high acclaim from critics, with a score of 85 out of 100, based on 14 reviews. In September 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the show 77th on its list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century, stating that &quot;a key part...of the golden age of antihero drama, this thriller about likable – and utterly corrupt – cops broke new ground for bold, risk-taking television&quot;.

The premiere episode of &quot;The Shield&quot; had a 4.1 rating, at the time a record for a dramatic program on basic cable. However, &quot;The Shield&quot; lost advertising from Burger King, New Balance, Office Depot, and Tricon Global Restaurants, in part due to complaints from the Parents Television Council.

==Other media==

===Comic===
In 2004, IDW Publishing released a five-issue comic book limited series written by Jeff Mariotte and illustrated by Jean Diaz titled &quot;The Shield: Spotlight&quot;. A controversial journalist is murdered and the Barn is under intense media scrutiny. Vic and the Strike Team find the murderer but uncover a bigger conspiracy which has Dutch enthralled. All the while, Shane is trying to keep his face out of the media when he accidentally sets up a chance to earn the team much money recovering stolen art, and Julien and Danny struggle to realize when is the right time to go &quot;by the book&quot; and when is not. When uniformed officers spot the Strike Team with the stolen art, they have no choice but to do things the right way. Aceveda is warned to drop the journalists investigation or risk losing political backing. He drops the case which leaves Dutch feeling disheartened.

===Home media===
The first five seasons were originally distributed by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment for region 1. However, in 2008, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment became the rights holders for the DVDs. They released season 6 and re-released seasons 1–5 in slimmer packaging in 2008, and released season 7 in 2009. International releases have always been distributed by Sony, who have only ever presented the show in 16:9 (widescreen) format, as opposed to the Fox releases, which presented the show in 4:3. All the re-releases by Sony along with seasons 6 and 7, and the complete series box set are presented in widescreen. The Sony region 2 release of season 5 has a shortened version of the season finale—48 minutes, as opposed to the regular 67-minute version.

In November 2012, all seven seasons were made available for purchase on iTunes. On February 26, 2013, Amazon.com announced the addition of the series to its Prime service, but the series is now only available for purchase. The series is available for streaming on Hulu as part of FX&#x27;s catalog. All seven seasons are available on Netflix throughout Latin America.
On August 28, 2015, Shawn Ryan announced that he was revisiting the series for a 4K conversion. In August 2017, Ryan announced the release had been delayed until 2018. In July 2018, Mill Creek Entertainment announced it would be releasing the complete series of &quot;The Shield&quot; on Blu-ray and that it would include all the extras from the previous DVD sets and includes new, exclusive featurettes. It was released on December 18, 2018.

===Soundtrack===

On September 5, 2005, &quot;The Shield: Music from the Streets&quot; was released by Lakeshore Entertainment. The soundtrack features 19 tracks, including two versions of the theme song and tracks ranging from artists such as Black Label Society to Kelis.

===Video game===
After a rocky development cycle, &quot;The Shield&quot;, the video game, was released for the PlayStation 2 on January 9, 2007, and for the PC on January 22, 2007. It is a third-person shooter that bridges the gap between the third and fourth seasons by exploring the gang war between the Byz-Lats and the One-Niners. It received generally negative reviews.

<text>King Xian of Zhou (), personal name Ji Bian, was a king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty.

Very little is known about him. He succeeded his brother King Lie in 368 BC and ruled until his death in 321 BC.

He sent gifts to many of the feudal states, supposedly his vassals, particularly the Qin and Chu states. Late in his reign, the rulers of the states declared themselves kings, and ceased to recognise the king of Zhou as even nominally their overlord.

After his death, he was succeeded by his son, King Shenjing.

<text>A hedge is an investment position intended to offset potential losses or gains that may be incurred by a companion investment. A hedge can be constructed from many types of financial instruments, including stocks, exchange-traded funds, insurance, forward contracts, swaps, options, gambles, many types of over-the-counter and derivative products, and futures contracts.

Public futures markets were established in the 19th century to allow transparent, standardized, and efficient hedging of agricultural commodity prices; they have since expanded to include futures contracts for hedging the values of energy, precious metals, foreign currency, and interest rate fluctuations.

==Etymology==
Hedging is the practice of taking a position in one market to offset and balance against the risk adopted by assuming a position in a contrary or opposing market or investment. The word hedge is from Old English &quot;hecg&quot;, originally any fence, living or artificial. The first known use of the word as a verb meaning &#x27;dodge, evade&#x27; dates from the 1590s; that of &#x27;insure oneself against loss,&#x27; as in a bet, is from the 1670s.

==Hedge-investment duality==
Optimal hedging and optimal investments are intimately connected. It can be shown that one person&#x27;s optimal investment is another&#x27;s optimal hedge (and vice versa). This follows from a geometric structure formed by probabilistic representations of market views and risk scenarios. In practice, the hedge-investment duality is related to the widely used notion of risk recycling.

==Examples==

===Agricultural commodity price hedging===
A typical hedger might be a commercial farmer. The market values of wheat and other crops fluctuate constantly as supply and demand for them vary, with occasional large moves in either direction. Based on current prices and forecast levels at harvest time, the farmer might decide that planting wheat is a good idea one season, but the price of wheat might change over time. Once the farmer plants wheat, he is committed to it for an entire growing season. If the actual price of wheat rises greatly between planting and harvest, the farmer stands to make a lot of unexpected money, but if the actual price drops by harvest time, he is going to lose the invested money.

Due to the uncertainty of future supply and demand fluctuations, and the price risk imposed on the farmer, the farmer in this example may use different financial transactions to reduce, or hedge, their risk. One such transaction is the use of forward contracts. Forward contracts are mutual agreements to deliver a certain amount of a commodity at a certain date for a specified price and each contract is unique to the buyer and seller. For this example, the farmer can sell a number of forward contracts equivalent to the amount of wheat he expects to harvest and essentially lock in the current price of wheat. Once the forward contracts expire, the farmer will harvest the wheat and deliver it to the buyer at the price agreed to in the forward contract. Therefore, the farmer has reduced his risks to fluctuations in the market of wheat because he has already guaranteed a certain number of bushels for a certain price. However, there are still many risks associated with this type of hedge. For example, if the farmer has a low yield year and he harvests less than the amount specified in the forward contracts, he must purchase the bushels elsewhere in order to fill the contract. This becomes even more of a problem when the lower yields affect the entire wheat industry and the price of wheat increases due to supply and demand pressures. Also, while the farmer hedged all of the risks of a price decrease away by locking in the price with a forward contract, he also gives up the right to the benefits of a price increase. Another risk associated with the forward contract is the risk of default or renegotiation. The forward contract locks in a certain amount and price at a certain future date. Because of that, there is always the possibility that the buyer will not pay the amount required at the end of the contract or that the buyer will try to renegotiate the contract before it expires.

Futures contracts are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without a few of the risks that forward contracts have. Futures contracts are similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearing houses. Clearing houses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Futures contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of futures contracts. Futures contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearing houses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.

===Hedging a stock price===
A common hedging technique used in the financial industry is the long/short equity technique.

A stock trader believes that the stock price of Company A will rise over the next month, due to the company&#x27;s new and efficient method of producing widgets. They want to buy Company A shares to profit from their expected price increase, as they believe that shares are currently underpriced. But Company A is part of a highly volatile widget industry. So there is a risk of a future event that affects stock prices across the whole industry, including the stock of Company A along with all other companies.

Since the trader is interested in the specific company, rather than the entire industry, they want to &quot;hedge out&quot; the industry-related risk by short selling an equal value of shares from Company A&#x27;s direct, yet weaker competitor, Company B.

The first day the trader&#x27;s portfolio is:
* Long 1,000 shares of Company A at $1 each
* Short 500 shares of Company B at $2 each

The trader has sold short the same value of shares (the value, number of shares × price, is $1000 in both cases).

If the trader was able to short sell an asset whose price had a mathematically defined relation with Company A&#x27;s stock price (for example a put option on Company A shares), the trade might be essentially riskless. In this case, the risk would be limited to the put option&#x27;s premium.

On the second day, a favorable news story about the widgets industry is published and the value of all widgets stock goes up. Company A, however, because it is a stronger company, increases by 10%, while Company B increases by just 5%:
* Long 1,000 shares of Company A at $1.10 each: $100 gain
* Short 500 shares of Company B at $2.10 each: $50 loss (in a short position, the investor loses money when the price goes up)

The trader might regret the hedge on day two, since it reduced the profits on the Company A position. But on the third day, an unfavorable news story is published about the health effects of widgets, and all widgets stocks crash: 50% is wiped off the value of the widgets industry in the course of a few hours. Nevertheless, since Company A is the better company, it suffers less than Company B:

Value of long position (Company A):
* Day 1: $1,000
* Day 2: $1,100
* Day 3: $550 =&gt; ($1,000 − $550) = $450 loss

Value of short position (Company B):
* Day 1: −$1,000
* Day 2: −$950
* Day 3: −$525 =&gt; ($1,000 − $525) = $475 profit

Without the hedge, the trader would have lost $450. But the hedge – the short sale of Company B – nets a profit of $25 during a dramatic market collapse.

===Stock/futures hedging===
The introduction of stock market index futures has provided a second means of hedging risk on a single stock by selling short the market, as opposed to another single or selection of stocks. Futures are generally highly fungible and cover a wide variety of potential investments, which makes them easier to use than trying to find another stock which somehow represents the opposite of a selected investment. Futures hedging is widely used as part of the traditional long/short play.

===Hedging employee stock options===
Employee stock options (ESOs) are securities issued by the company mainly to its own executives and employees. These securities are more volatile than stocks. An efficient way to lower the ESO risk is to sell exchange traded calls and, to a lesser degree, to buy puts. Companies discourage hedging the ESOs but there is no prohibition against it.

===Hedging fuel consumption===
Airlines use futures contracts and derivatives to hedge their exposure to the price of jet fuel. They know that they must purchase jet fuel for as long as they want to stay in business, and fuel prices are notoriously volatile. By using crude oil futures contracts to hedge their fuel requirements (and engaging in similar but more complex derivatives transactions), Southwest Airlines was able to save a large amount of money when buying fuel as compared to rival airlines when fuel prices in the U.S. rose dramatically after the 2003 Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.

===Hedging emotions===

As an emotion regulation strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win to reduce the negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. Some scientific wagers, such as Hawking&#x27;s 1974 &quot;insurance policy&quot; bet, fall into this category.

People typically do not bet against desired outcomes that are important to their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to you that you are not as committed to them as you thought you were.

===Hedging equity and equity futures===
Equity in a portfolio can be hedged by taking an opposite position in futures. To protect your stock picking against systematic market risk, futures are shorted when equity is purchased, or long futures when stock is shorted.

One way to hedge is the market neutral approach. In this approach, an equivalent dollar amount in the stock trade is taken in futures – for example, by buying 10,000 GBP worth of Vodafone and shorting 10,000 worth of FTSE futures (the index in which Vodafone trades).

Another way to hedge is the beta neutral. Beta is the historical correlation between a stock and an index. If the beta of a Vodafone stock is 2, then for a 10,000 GBP long position in Vodafone an investor would hedge with a 20,000 GBP equivalent short position in the FTSE futures.

Futures contracts and forward contracts are means of hedging against the risk of adverse market movements. These originally developed out of commodity markets in the 19th century, but over the last fifty years a large global market developed in products to hedge financial market risk.

====Futures hedging====
Investors who primarily trade in futures may hedge their futures against synthetic futures. A synthetic in this case is a synthetic future comprising a call and a put position. Long synthetic futures means long call and short put at the same expiry price. To hedge against a long futures trade a short position in synthetics can be established, and vice versa.

&quot;Stack hedging&quot; is a strategy which involves buying various futures contracts that are concentrated in nearby delivery months to increase the liquidity position. It is generally used by investors to ensure the surety of their earnings for a longer period of time.

====Contract for difference====

A contract for difference (CFD) is a two-way hedge or swap contract that allows the seller and purchaser to fix the price of a volatile commodity. Consider a deal between an electricity producer and an electricity retailer, both of whom trade through an electricity market pool. If the producer and the retailer agree to a strike price of $50 per MWh, for 1 MWh in a trading period, and if the actual pool price is $70, then the producer gets $70 from the pool but has to rebate $20 (the &quot;difference&quot; between the strike price and the pool price) to the retailer.

Conversely, the retailer pays the difference to the producer if the pool price is lower than the agreed upon contractual strike price. In effect, the pool volatility is nullified and the parties pay and receive $50 per MWh. However, the party who pays the difference is &quot;out of the money&quot; because without the hedge they would have received the benefit of the pool price.

==Types of hedging==
Hedging can be used in many different ways including foreign exchange trading. The stock example above is a &quot;classic&quot; sort of hedge, known in the industry as a pairs trade due to the trading on a pair of related securities. As investors became more sophisticated, along with the mathematical tools used to calculate values (known as models), the types of hedges have increased greatly.

Examples of hedging include:
* Forward exchange contract for currencies
* Commodity future contracts for hedging physical positions
* Currency future contracts
* Money Market Operations for currencies
* Forward Exchange Contract for interest
* Money Market Operations for interest
* Future contracts for interest
* Covered Calls on equities
* Short Straddles on equities or indexes
* Bets on elections or sporting events

==Hedging strategies==

A hedging strategy usually refers to the general risk management policy of a financially and physically trading firm how to minimize their risks. As the term hedging indicates, this risk mitigation is usually done by using financial instruments, but a hedging strategy as used by commodity traders like large energy companies, is usually referring to a business model (including both financial &quot;and&quot; physical deals).

In order to show the difference between these strategies, consider the fictional company &quot;BlackIsGreen Ltd&quot; trading coal by buying this commodity at the wholesale market and selling it to households mostly in winter.

===Back-to-back hedging===
Back-to-back (B2B) is a strategy where any open position is immediately closed, e.g. by buying the respective commodity on the spot market.
This technique is often applied in the commodity market when the customers’ price is directly calculable from visible forward energy prices at the point of customer sign-up.

If &quot;BlackIsGreen&quot; decides to have a B2B-strategy, they would buy the exact amount of coal at the very moment when the household customer comes into their shop and signs the contract. This strategy minimizes many commodity risks, but has the drawback that it has a large volume and liquidity risk, as &quot;BlackIsGreen&quot; does not know whether it can find enough coal on the wholesale market to fulfill the need of the households.

===Tracker hedging===
Tracker hedging is a pre-purchase approach, where the open position is decreased the closer the maturity date comes.

If &quot;BlackIsGreen&quot; knows that most of the consumers demand coal in winter to heat their house, a strategy driven by a tracker would now mean that &quot;BlackIsGreen&quot; buys e.g. half of the expected coal volume in summer, another quarter in autumn and the remaining volume in winter. The closer the winter comes, the better are the weather forecasts and therefore the estimate, how much coal will be demanded by the households in the coming winter.

Retail customers’ price will be influenced by long-term wholesale price trends. A certain &quot;hedging corridor&quot; around the pre-defined tracker-curve is allowed and fraction of the open positions decreases as the maturity date comes closer.

===Delta hedging===

Delta-hedging mitigates the financial risk of an option by hedging against price changes in its underlying. It is so called as Delta is the first derivative of the option&#x27;s value with respect to the underlying instrument&#x27;s price. This is performed in practice by buying a derivative with an inverse price movement. It is also a type of market neutral strategy.

Only if &quot;BlackIsGreen&quot; chooses to perform &quot;delta-hedging&quot; as strategy, actual financial instruments come into play for hedging (in the usual, stricter meaning).

===Risk reversal===
Risk reversal means simultaneously buying a call option and selling a put option. This has the effect of simulating being long on a stock or commodity position.

==Natural hedges==
Many hedges do not involve exotic financial instruments or derivatives such as the married put. A natural hedge is an investment that reduces the undesired risk by matching cash flows (i.e. revenues and expenses). For example, an exporter to the United States faces a risk of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar and chooses to open a production facility in that market to match its expected sales revenue to its cost structure.

Another example is a company that opens a subsidiary in another country and borrows in the foreign currency to finance its operations, even though the foreign interest rate may be more expensive than in its home country: by matching the debt payments to expected revenues in the foreign currency, the parent company has reduced its foreign currency exposure. Similarly, an oil producer may expect to receive its revenues in U.S. dollars, but faces costs in a different currency; it would be applying a natural hedge if it agreed to, for example, pay bonuses to employees in U.S. dollars.

One common means of hedging against risk is the purchase of insurance to protect against financial loss due to accidental property damage or loss, personal injury, or loss of life.

==Categories of hedgeable risk==
There are various types of financial risk that can be protected against with a hedge. Those include:

* Commodity risk: the risk that arises from potential movements in the value of commodity contracts, which include agricultural products, metals, and energy products. Corporates exposed on the &quot;procurement side&quot; of the value chain, require protection against rising commodity prices, where these cannot be &quot;passed on to the customer&quot;; on the sales side, corporates look towards hedging against a decline in price. Both may hedge using commodity-derivatives where available, or, if warranted, purchase a bespoke OTC hedge.

* Credit risk: the risk that money owing will not be paid by an obligor. Since credit risk is the natural business of banks, but an unwanted risk for commercial traders, an early market developed between banks and traders that involved selling obligations at a discounted rate. The contemporary practice in commerce settings is to purchase trade credit insurance; in an (investment) banking context, these risks can be hedged through credit derivatives. In the latter, analysts use CS01 re sensitivity, and models such as Jarrow–Turnbull and Merton / KMV to estimate the (risk neutral) probability of default, and/or (portfolio-wide) will use a transition matrix of Bond credit ratings to estimate the (actuarial) probability and impact of a &quot;credit migration&quot;. See Fixed income analysis.

* Currency risk: the risk that a financial instrument or business transaction will be affected unfavorably by a change in exchange rates. Foreign exchange risk hedging is used both by investors to deflect the risks they encounter when investing abroad, and by non-financial actors in the global economy for whom multi-currency activities are a &quot;necessary evil&quot; rather than a desired state of exposure. See also Currency analytics.

* Equity risk: the risk that one&#x27;s investments will depreciate because of stock market dynamics causing one to lose money. Additional to diversification – the fundamental risk mitigant here – investment managers will apply various risk management techniques to their portfolios as appropriate: these may relate to the portfolio as a whole or to individual stocks as above; see for further discussion.

* Interest rate risk: the risk that the value of an interest-bearing liability, such as a loan or a bond, will worsen due to an interest rate increase (see ). Interest rate risks can be hedged using Interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps; sensitivities here are measured using duration and convexity for bonds, and DV01 and key rate durations generally. At the portfolio level, cash-flow risks are typically managed via immunization or cashflow matching, while valuation-risk is hedged through bond index futures or options

* Volatility risk: the risk of a change in the volatility of a risk factor, negatively impacting the price of a portfolio or instrument. This risk particularly applies to derivative instruments, where the volatility of the underlying is a major influence on prices. It is also relevant to portfolios of basic assets, and to foreign currency trading. This risk can be managed using appropriate financial instruments such as variance swaps and VIX futures contracts.
==Related concepts==
* Forwards: A contract specifying future delivery of an amount of an item, at a price decided now. The delivery is obligatory, not optional.
* Forward rate agreement (FRA): A contract specifying an interest rate amount to be settled at a pre-determined interest rate on the date of the contract.
* Option (finance): similar to a forward contract, but optional.
** Call option: A contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy an item in the future, at a price decided now.
** Put option: A contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell an item in the future, at a price decided now.
* Non-deliverable forwards (NDF): A strictly risk-transfer financial product similar to a forward rate agreement, but used only where monetary policy restrictions on the currency in question limit the free flow and conversion of capital. As the name suggests, NDFs are not delivered but settled in a reference currency, usually USD or EUR, where the parties exchange the gain or loss that the NDF instrument yields, and if the buyer of the controlled currency truly needs that hard currency, he can take the reference payout and go to the government in question and convert the USD or EUR payout. The insurance effect is the same; it&#x27;s just that the supply of insured currency is restricted and controlled by government. See capital control.
* Interest rate parity and Covered interest arbitrage: The simple concept that two similar investments in two different currencies ought to yield the same return. If the two similar investments are not at face value offering the same interest rate return, the difference should conceptually be made up by changes in the exchange rate over the life of the investment. IRP basically provides the math to calculate a projected or implied forward rate of exchange. This calculated rate is not and cannot be considered a prediction or forecast, but rather is the arbitrage-free calculation for what the exchange rate is implied to be in order for it to be impossible to make a free profit by converting money to one currency, investing it for a period, then converting back and making more money than if a person had invested in the same opportunity in the original currency.
* Hedge fund: A fund which may engage in hedged transactions or hedged investment strategies.

<text>The dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) is a species of junco, a group of small, grayish New World sparrows. The species is common across much of temperate North America and in summer it ranges far into the Arctic. It is a variable species, much like the related fox sparrow (&quot;Passerella iliaca&quot;), and its systematics are still not completely resolved.

==Taxonomy==
The dark-eyed junco was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Fringilla hyemalis&quot;. The description consisted merely of the laconic remark &quot;&quot;F[ringilla] nigra, ventre albo.&quot; (&quot;A black &#x27;finch&#x27; with white belly&quot;) and a statement that it came from America. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;Snow-Bird&quot; that Mark Catesby had described and illustrated in his 1731 &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;.

The Bill of this Bird is white: The Breast and Belly white. All the rest of the Body black; but in some places dusky, inclining to Lead-color. In &quot;Virginia&quot; and &quot;Carolina&quot; they appear only in Winter: and in Snow they appear most. In Summer none are seen. Whether they retire and breed in the North (which is most probable) or where they go, when they leave these Countries in Spring, is to me unknown. [italics in original]The type locality was restricted to South Carolina by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1931. The dark-eyed junco is now placed in the genus &quot;Junco&quot; that was introduced in 1831 by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler. The genus name &quot;Junco&quot; is the Spanish word for rush, from the Latin word &quot;juncus&quot;. Its modern scientific name means &quot;winter junco&quot;, from the Latin word &quot;&quot; &quot;of the winter&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Either 14 or 15 subspecies are recognized. These subspecies are grouped in two or three large or polytypic groups and three or four small or monotypic ones, all depending on the authority. These groups were formerly considered separate species, but they interbreed extensively in areas of contact. Birders trying to identify subspecies are advised to consult detailed identification references.

====Slate-colored group====
* Slate-colored dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. hyemalis&quot;) - Alaska, across Canada from Newfoundland &amp; Labrador to British Columbia, northeast U.S. from Massachusetts to Minnesota, northwest Mexico from Baja California to Chihuahua, &amp; Gulf Coast states
* Carolina dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. carolinensis&quot;) - Appalachian Mountains from northwest West Virgina &amp; western Maryland south to northern Georgia
* Cassiar dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. cismontanus&quot;; possibly a slate-colored dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. hyemalis&quot;) x Oregon dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. oreganus&quot;) hybrid - Yukon, British Columbia, &amp; Alberta south through Great Plains down toward north-central Mexico

These two or three subspecies have dark slate-gray heads, breasts and upperparts. Females are brownish-gray, sometimes with reddish-brown flanks. They breed in the North American boreal forests from Alaska to Newfoundland and south to the Appalachian Mountains, wintering throughout most of the United States. They are relatively common across their range.

====White-winged group====
* white-winged dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. aikeni&quot;)

This subspecies has a medium-gray head, breast, and upperparts with white wing bars. Females are washed brownish. It has more white in the tail than the other 14 subspecies. It is a common endemic breeder in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Montana, and winters south to northeastern New Mexico.

====Oregon or brown-backed group====
* Montana dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. montanus&quot;) - Interior British Columbia, Alberta, eastern Washington, northeast Oregon, Idaho, Montana, &amp; Wyoming
* Nevada dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. mutabilis&quot;) - Great Basin
* Oregon dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. oreganus&quot;) - Coastal southeast Alaska to central British Columbia
* Point Pinos dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. pinosus&quot;) - Coastal ranges of California (San Francisco to southern Monterey County)
* Laguna Hanson dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. pontilis&quot;) - Mountains of northern Baja California (Sierra Juarez)
* Shufeldt&#x27;s dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. shufeldti&quot;) - West slopes of coastal mountains from western Oregon to southwest British Columbia
* Thurber&#x27;s dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. thurberi&quot;) - Southern California to Sierra Nevada (Imperial to Nevada County)
* Townsend&#x27;s dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. townsendi&quot;) - Mountains of northern Baja California (San Pedro Martir)

These eight subspecies have blackish-gray heads and breasts with brown backs and wings and reddish flanks, tending toward duller and paler plumage in the inland and southern parts of its range. Oregon dark-eyed juncos are also less commonly known as brown-backed dark-eyed juncos. This is the most common subspecies group in the West, breeding in the Pacific Coast Ranges from southeastern Alaska to extreme northern Baja California and wintering to the Great Plains and northern Sonora. An unresolved debate exists as to whether this large and distinct subspecies group is actually a separate species with eight (or nine, see below) subspecies of its own.

====Pink-sided group====
* pink-sided dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. mearnsi&quot;)

Sometimes considered a ninth subspecies in the Oregon/brown-backed group, this subspecies has a lighter gray head and breast than the eight Oregon/brown-backed dark-eyed juncos, with contrasting dark lores. The back and wings are brown. It has a pinkish-cinnamon color that is richer and covers more of the flanks and breast than in the eight Oregon/brown-backed dark-eyed juncos. It breeds in the northern Rocky Mountains from southern Alberta to eastern Idaho and western Wyoming and winters in central Idaho and nearby Montana and from southwestern South Dakota, southern Wyoming, and northern Utah to northern Sonora and Chihuahua.

====Gray-headed group====
* gray-headed dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. caniceps&quot;)

This subspecies is essentially rather light gray on top with a rusty back. It breeds in the southern Rocky Mountains from Colorado to central Arizona and New Mexico, and winters into northern Mexico.

====Red-backed group====
* red-backed dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. dorsalis&quot;)

Sometimes included with the gray-headed dark-eyed junco proper as part of the gray-headed group, this subspecies differs from it in having a more silvery bill with a dark-colored upper mandible and a light-colored lower mandible, a variable amount of rust on the wings, and pale underparts. This makes it similar to the yellow-eyed junco (&quot;Junco phaeonotus&quot;), except for the dark eyes. It is found in the southern mountains of Arizona and New Mexico. It does not overlap with the yellow-eyed junco in its breeding range.

==Related species==
The extremely rare Guadalupe junco (&quot;Junco insularis&quot;) was formerly considered to be a subspecies of this species (either included in the gray-headed group or placed in a seventh group of its own, the Guadalupe group), but is now treated as a separate species in its own right – perhaps a rather young one, but certainly this population has evolved more rapidly than the 14 or 15 subspecies of the dark-eyed junco on the mainland due to its small population size and the founder effect.

==Description==
Adult dark-eyed juncos generally have gray heads, necks, and breasts, gray or brown backs and wings, and a white belly, but show a confusing amount of variation in plumage details. The white outer tail feathers flash distinctively in flight and while hopping on the ground. The bill is usually pale pinkish.

Males tend to have darker, more conspicuous markings than females. The dark-eyed junco is long and has a wingspan of . Body mass can vary from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . Juveniles often have pale streaks on their underparts and may even be mistaken for vesper sparrows (&quot;Pooecetes gramineus&quot;) until they acquire adult plumage at two to three months, but dark-eyed junco fledglings&#x27; heads are generally quite uniform in color already, and initially their bills still have conspicuous yellowish edges to the gape, remains of the fleshy wattles that guide the parents when they feed the nestlings.

The song is a trill similar to the chipping sparrow&#x27;s (&quot;Spizella passerina&quot;), except that the red-backed dark-eyed junco&#x27;s (see above) song is more complex, similar to that of the yellow-eyed junco (&quot;Junco phaeonotus&quot;). The call also resembles that of the black-throated blue warbler (&quot;Setophaga caerulescens&quot;) which is a member of the New World warbler family. Calls include &quot;tick&quot; sounds and very high-pitched tinkling &quot;chip&quot;s. It is known among bird song practitioners as an excellent bird to study for learning &quot;bird language&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The dark-eyed junco&#x27;s breeding habitat is coniferous or mixed forest areas throughout North America. In otherwise optimal conditions it also utilizes other habitats, but at the southern margin of its range it can only persist in its favorite habitat. Northern birds migrate further south, arriving in their winter quarters between mid-September and November and leaving to breed from mid-March onwards, with almost all of them gone by the end of April or so. Many populations are permanent residents or altitudinal migrants, while in cold years they may choose to stay in their winter range and breed there. For example, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of eastern California, &quot;J. hyemalis&quot; populations will migrate to winter ranges lower than their summer range. Seasonally sympatric females show difference in migration and reproductive timing that is dependent on hormone and ovary regulation. The migrant female &quot;J. hyemails&quot; experience delayed growth in the gonad to allow time for their seasonal migration. They then migrate down to the northeastern United States, where the resident subspecies is the Carolina dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. carolinensis&quot;). Female Carolina dark-eyed juncos have large ovaries and, therefore, do not experience gonadal growth delays because they are residents in the area. In winter, dark-eyed juncos are familiar in and around towns, and in many places are the most common birds at feeders. The slate-colored dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. h. hyemalis&quot;) is a rare vagrant to Western Europe and may successfully winter in Great Britain, usually in domestic gardens.

==Behavior and ecology==
These birds forage on the ground. In winter, they often forage in flocks that may contain several different subspecies. They mainly eat seeds and insects, with seeds comprising three quarters of their year-round diet. However, during the breeding season, insects comprise nearly half of the diet of adult dark-eyed juncos. Young dark-eyed juncos also depend on a diet of mainly insects.

A flock of dark-eyed juncos has been known to be called a blizzard.

===Breeding===
Dark-eyed juncos usually nest in a cup-shaped depression on the ground, well-hidden by vegetation or other material, although nests are sometimes found in the lower branches of a shrub or tree. The nests have an outer diameter of about and are lined with fine grasses and hair. Normally, two clutches of four eggs are laid during the breeding season. The slightly glossy eggs are grayish or pale bluish-white and heavily spotted (sometimes splotched) with various shades of brown, purple or gray. The spotting is concentrated at the large end of the egg. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12 to 13 days. The young leave the nest between 11 and 14 days after hatching.

=== Diet ===
Dark-eyed juncos mostly feed on insects and seeds, along with berries.

== Evolution ==

=== Postglacial theory and diversification ===
Dark-eyed juncos have been widely investigated as a model for rapid speciation. This is due to exceptionally high phenotypic diversity, as seen in the large number of color patterns, over what seems to be a very short amount of time. Current estimates of dark-eyed junco (&quot;J. hyemalis&quot;) evolution place diversification from yellow-eyed juncos (&quot;J. phaeonotus&quot;) at 1,800 years ago, based on mtDNA. One theory for the cause of this expansion is postglacial theory. This theory claims ancestral junco populations expanded further north across North America as glaciers melted. Receding glaciers would open up many novel habitats, with new selective pressures. Under those conditions, natural selection can impact populations very strongly, since there are many open niches. Thus, even short periods of isolation can cause populations to diverge. Postglacial theory is supported by yellow-eyed and dark-eyed juncos sharing a dominant haplotype in their mitochondrial DNA, which indicates a recent burst in population. Yellow-eyed juncos are relatively reproductively isolated. Thus, a trait is more likely to be found in both species because of ancestry than gene flow, since the likelihood of interbreeding occurring often enough for the trait to be so common is much less likely than it being inherited from a single ancestral event. The range of red-backed (&quot;J. h. dorsalis&quot;) and grey-headed juncos (&quot;J. h. caniceps&quot;) in the south of North America also provides evidence, as the two seem to represent successive steps in developing dark-eyed forms. The red-backed junco is very similar to the yellow-eyed junco in appearance. It also has the most southern range of the dark-eyed junco species. Under postglacial theory, this population would be older than the others, since populations expanded northwards. The gray-headed junco, which is found further north, has the same lighter beak as the rest of the junco complex. Together, they show the number of dark-eyed junco-like traits increasing as they move north. If the postglacial theory applies, northern junco subspecies would have diversified later. This makes their wide range of coloration more notable, since it would have to arise even faster.

Oregon junco group diversification is likely a result of both genetic drift and selection. Geographically isolated subspecies, like &quot;J. h. townsendi&quot; and &quot;J. h. pontilis&quot;, had low genetic–environmental association. This meant that most of the differences between them did not grant a measurable benefit to fitness. Instead, most differences were likely due to isolation and small population size. Those would increase the impact of genetic drift, increasing differences between the subspecies. Isolation barriers created by unsuitable desert habitat likely led to this lack of gene flow. Other subspecies, like &quot;J. h. pinosis&quot; and &quot;J. h. thurberi&quot;, were much less geographically isolated. Their ranges often overlap, forming zones of intergradation where both subspecies exist and interbreed. Instead of geographic isolation, differences between these subspecies are probably driven by adaptation. This is supported by &quot;J. h. pinosis&quot; populations correlating with isothermality, or how much temperatures shift from day to night and season to season, and negatively with elevation. This indicates that they likely adapted to those specific conditions. Reproductive barriers could then come from those adaptations and differences in preferred habitat, rather than lack of interaction. There was also notable gene flow between &quot;J. h. thurberi&quot;, &quot;J. h. shufeldti&quot;, &quot;J. h. montanus&quot; and &quot;J. h. oreganus&quot;. These subspecies formed a latitudinal gradient, where subspecies bleed into each other and decrease or increase in a number in patterns correlating to latitude. Divergence was likely driven by local adaptation along the path north. Overall, it is likely that there is no single mechanism driving the historical diversification of dark-eyed juncos. Different subspecies feel different evolutionary forces with more or less frequency. However, multiple forces compound to drive divergence in all or most of the subspecies. It is likely that in the case of the dark-eyed juncos, these multiple factors have worked to accelerate change. Sexual selection and geographic isolation work to reinforce and amplify small changes established by genetic drift and natural selection. The exact mechanisms behind the speedy diversification of juncos remain a subject for more research.

=== Urbanization ===
Dark-eyed junco populations are also of interest to scientists for how they are responding to urbanization. Much of this is modeled through a population of dark-eyed juncos living on the University of California, San Diego&#x27;s campus. The population was first studied in the 1980s, and has been a subject of interest for how much they differ from less urban neighboring populations. One of the most notable differences of the UCSD population is that they do not migrate like other populations of Oregon juncos. Instead, they remain on campus year-round. This differentiates them from other junco populations that migrate to the UCSD campus only in the winter. This lack of migration was likely influenced by the San Diego area&#x27;s mild, Mediterranean climate. This climate also results in longer breeding seasons than exist at higher latitudes. This allows UCSD juncos to have as many as four broods per year, rather than the one or two of nearby populations. Greater brood size, in turn, may have acted as a selective pressure for parental involvement. Since birds breed more within a season, initial mating is less important, and males who are involved in care are more likely to breed again in that same season. UCSD resident birds also flock in pairs more often than overwintering birds, which may have resulted from the same selective pressures.

Despite other junco populations existing nearby, the populations diverge much more than expected. The degree of difference between the UCSD juncos and other local juncos was closer to what would be expected with geographic isolation. Since the nearest populations (located in the mountains) are of the subspecies &quot;J. h. thurberi&quot;, it was assumed the UCSD birds came from an ancestral &quot;J. h. thurberi&quot; population. However, genome analysis reveals that the population was likely established from the coastal subspecies &quot;J. h. pinosis&quot; 20–30 generations ago, which are conditions that make the founder effect very likely to be relevant. This conclusion is further supported by phenotypic similarities: the UCSD birds and &quot;J. h. pinosis&quot; share similar degrees of white in their tail and nonmigratory behavior. This realization undercuts the idea that urbanization drives the lack of migration, but not that it caused many of the other changes. More evidence comes from the UCSD birds occasionally interbreeding with overwintering &quot;J. h. pinosis&quot; individuals, but not &quot;J. h. thurberi&quot;. This is in spite of &quot;J. h. thurberi&quot; juncos being much more common in the area. If the UCSD population were interbreeding with both, it would most likely have been observed already. Since the founding population was quite small, and the nearest &quot;J. h. pinosis&quot; population far away, genetic drift likely had a large influence on how the population developed. However, a strong association between habitat variables and functional genes was found. This association is a sign of natural selection and adaptive traits, not drift alone. This indicates that genetic drift is likely not the only evolutionary force at play. Selection is likely magnifying changes initially driven by drift, allowing the UCSD population to diverge from its neighbors very quickly.

More proof of adaptive genes in the UCSD population can be found on the gene level. Two of the most differentiated genes between the ancestral &quot;J. h. pinosis&quot; population and the UCSD birds were linked to beneficial traits for urban environments. Specifically, an &quot;ABCB6&quot; allele conferred better tolerance of heavy metals. As heavy metal poisoning is a documented issue for urban birds, this gene likely increases fitness in urban environments. Variation in &quot;KCNQ4&quot; is linked to high-frequency echolocation in bats, and seems to correlate with making higher pitched calls. This is helpful in an urban environment because low-frequency urban noise often drowns out bird calls. With higher pitched vocalizations, calls would be less likely to get lost in that noise. Given the theorized survival advantages, the prevalence of these traits is likely to be driven by natural selection. Research remains to be done on which alleles in the UCSD population serve an adaptive function, and which are likely just consequences of drift. Especially with the discovery that they are more closely related to &quot;J. h. pinosis&quot;, much pre-existing research may be less relevant. However, they are still a very promising model system for how birds adapt to urban ecosystems.

<text>In typography, a dingbat (sometimes more formally known as a printer&#x27;s ornament or printer&#x27;s character) is an ornament, specifically, a glyph used in typesetting, often employed to create box frames (similar to box-drawing characters), or as a dinkus (section divider). Some of the dingbat symbols have been used as signature marks or used in bookbinding to order sections.

In the computer industry, a dingbat font or pi font is a computer font that has symbols and shapes located at the code points normally designated for alphabetical or numeric characters. This practice was necessitated by the limited number of code points available in 20th century operating systems. Modern computer fonts containing dingbats are based on Unicode encoding, which has unique code points for dingbat glyphs.

==Examples==
Examples of characters included in Unicode (ITC Zapf Dingbats series 100 and others):
 

==Dingbats Unicode block==

Unicode provides code points for many commonly used dingbats, as listed below. Prior to widespread adoption of Unicode in the early 2010s, &quot;dingbat fonts&quot; were created that allocated dingbat glyphs to codepoints in code positions otherwise allocated to &quot;normal&quot; character sets.

The Dingbats block (U+2700–U+27BF) (under the original block name &quot;Zapf Dingbats&quot;, so named for type designer Hermann Zapf) was added to the Unicode Standard in October 1991, with the release of version 1.0.
This code block contains decorative character variants, and other marks of emphasis and non-textual symbolism. Most of its characters were taken from Zapf Dingbats. The block name was changed from &quot;Zapf Dingbats&quot; to &quot;Dingbats&quot; in June 1993, with the release of 1.1.

==Ornamental Dingbats Unicode block==

The Ornamental Dingbats block () was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.
This code block contains ornamental leaves, punctuation, and ampersands, quilt squares, and checkerboard patterns.
It is a subset of dingbat fonts Webdings, Wingdings, and Wingdings 2.

<doc id="338044" wikidata="Q1279933" url="?curid=338044" title="King Nan of Zhou">
<text>King Nan of Zhou (?–256 BC), personal name Ji Yan, also less commonly known as King Yin of Zhou, was the last king of the Zhou dynasty of China. He was the son of King Shenjing and grandson of King Xian. He was king from 314 BC until his death in 256 BC, a reign of fifty-nine years, the longest in the Zhou dynasty and all of pre-imperial China.

By the time of King Nan&#x27;s reign, the king of Zhou had lost almost all political and military power, as even their remaining crown land was split into two states, led by rival feudal lords: Western Zhou state, where the capital Wangcheng was located, and Eastern Zhou state, centred at Chengzhou. Therefore, King Nan lacked any personal territory and was effectively under the control of the local feudal lords, essentially relying on their charity.

However, Nan&#x27;s symbolic and ritual power remains disputed. On one side, the feudal states largely ignored the king&#x27;s activities and adopted royal titles and rituals for themselves, while the Zhou dynasty&#x27;s fall generally received meagre contemporary coverage and attention. This led to the assumption that King Nan no longer had any symbolic power or semblance of royal authority left. On the other side, recent epigraphic discoveries and some accounts in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; and &quot;Strategies of the Warring States&quot; suggest that until his death, King Nan was still respected as the Son of Heaven. Either way, the last king of Zhou managed to preserve his weakened dynasty through diplomacy and conspiracies for fifty-nine years until his deposition by the Qin state and death in 256 BC.

==Life==
=== Reign ===
At the beginning of his reign in 314 BC, King Nan moved the capital from Chengzhou to Wangcheng. From then on, the Zhou crown lands were invaded several times by foreign powers, beginning with Qin&#x27;s attack on Yiyang in West Zhou in 307 BC. Only constant political manoeuvring and ever-changing alliances of the king and the feudal lords ensured the survival of West and East Zhou, even though the two Zhou states often weakened themselves by conspiring against each other. Once, Qin planned to march its troops through East and West Zhou to attack Han, so that the lords of Zhou feared to be caught in war between the two states. The Scribe Yan advised King Nan that it would be of advantage if Han would cede some territory to Zhou and Zhou send some hostages to Chu. Qin would then suspect the state of Chu was planning an attack on Qin during its campaign against Han. At the same time the king of Zhou should, as Yan suggested, explain to the king of Qin that Han suspected Zhou of conspiring with Qin because of the present of land made to Zhou. With this method the king of Zhou would increase his territory and avoid Qin troops marching through his land. On another occasion, King Nan was summoned to Qin&#x27;s royal court to debate the question of attacking the Han city of Nanyang. Instead of following the request, Nan conspired with Han to block the way between Zhou and Qin in order to prevent the debate and avoid a war.

King Nan&#x27;s rule was not only threatened by outside powers, but also by the constant conflict between the lords of West and East Zhou. When they went to war, the state of Han initially supported West Zhou&#x27;s nobles, but went on to betray its allies. Instead of fighting East Zhou, the Han forces looted Wangcheng and Nan&#x27;s royal palace, while avoiding war with the Son of Heaven, King Nan, as they were still officially &quot;allies&quot;. As Zhou grew increasingly weak, the king&#x27;s rule was more frequently challenged by expansionist Qin. In 273 BC Ma Fan developed a plan to protect the Nine Tripod Cauldrons of Yu the Great representing royal authority by enlisting the help of King Anxi of Wei, who constructed a fortification wall for Zhou. Nevertheless, the Zhou dynasty remained unable to stop Qin&#x27;s expansion, and Nan&#x27;s kingdom was only spared because the rulers of Qin believed that the annihilation of the land of the Son of Heaven would damage their names. In order to survive, Nan and his officials even used to function as a spy for Qin in explaining the military changes in the state of Han, Wei and Zhao.

=== Fall===
Only when Qin occupied the town of Fushu, belonging to Han, but in the vicinity of the ancient royal capital, Nan and the lords of West Zhou became so frightened of an impending invasion that they joined an alliance against Qin. West Zhou attacked Qin, but was quickly driven back. Wangcheng was finally conquered in 256 BC, and King Nan travelled to Xianyang to submit to King Zhaoxiang of Qin. West Zhou was then annexed by Qin, whereupon Nan was demoted to Duke of West Zhou. Imprisoned in Wangcheng, he died shortly afterwards, &quot;and the rituals of the Zhou dynasty ceased forever&quot;. Qin seized the Nine Tripod Cauldrons and exiled Nan&#x27;s heir, Ji Wen, to Danhu. Both the royal Ji family and many citizens of West Zhou then fled to East Zhou, where they and the local lords proclaimed Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou the new king. Duke Wen was never recognized king outside of East Zhou, however, so that Nan is generally considered the last rightful King of Zhou. Together with Nan&#x27;s son Ji Zhao, Wen led the resistance against Qin, but they were defeated in 251 and 249 BC, respectively. East Zhou was annexed by Qin, and none of Nan&#x27;s sons subsequently laid claim to the Zhou dynastic imperial title. The remaining royal Ji family fled to the State of Wey. Thus ended the Zhou dynasty, whose fall was hardly noted by the people and states of China. However, soon after Nan&#x27;s death a king of Qin lamented the dynasty&#x27;s fall as disruptive for the order of Heaven and Earth. Likewise, the scholars of Qin wrote in the Lüshi Chunqiu:
&quot;Nowadays, the house of Zhou has been destroyed, [the line of] the Sons of Heaven has been severed. There is no greater turmoil than the absence of the Son of Heaven; without the Son of Heaven, the strong overcome the weak, the many lord it over the few, they use arms to harm each other having no rest.&quot;
The title of &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; was eventually adopted by Qin Shi Huang, when he proclaimed himself the First Emperor.

<doc id="338046" wikidata="Q911907" url="?curid=338046" title="Dihedral angle">
<text>A dihedral angle is the angle between two intersecting planes or half-planes. It is a plane angle formed on a third plane, perpendicular to the line of intersection between the two planes or the common edge between the two half-planes. In higher dimensions, a dihedral angle represents the angle between two hyperplanes. In chemistry, it is the clockwise angle between half-planes through two sets of three atoms, having two atoms in common.

==Mathematical background==
When the two intersecting planes are described in terms of Cartesian coordinates by the two equations 
:formula_1 
:formula_2
the dihedral angle, formula_3 between them is given by:
:formula_4
and satisfies formula_5 It can easily be observed that the angle is independent of formula_6 and formula_7.

Alternatively, if and are normal vector to the planes, one has
:formula_8
where is the dot product of the vectors and is the product of their lengths.
The absolute value is required in above formulas, as the planes are not changed when changing all coefficient signs in one equation, or replacing one normal vector by its opposite.

However the absolute values can be and should be avoided when considering the dihedral angle of two half planes whose boundaries are the same line. In this case, the half planes can be described by a point of their intersection, and three vectors , and such that , and belong respectively to the intersection line, the first half plane, and the second half plane. The &quot;dihedral angle of these two half planes&quot; is defined by 
:formula_9,
and satisfies formula_10 In this case, switching the two half-planes gives the same result, and so does replacing formula_11 with formula_12 In chemistry (see below), we define a dihedral angle such that replacing formula_11 with formula_14 changes the sign of the angle, which can be between and .

==In polymer physics==
In some scientific areas such as polymer physics, one may consider a chain of points and links between consecutive points. If the points are sequentially numbered and located at positions , , , etc. then bond vectors are defined by =−, =−, and =−, more generally. This is the case for kinematic chains or amino acids in a protein structure. In these cases, one is often interested in the half-planes defined by three consecutive points, and the dihedral angle between two consecutive such half-planes. If , and are three consecutive bond vectors, the intersection of the half-planes is oriented, which allows defining a dihedral angle that belongs to the interval . This dihedral angle is defined by
:formula_15
or, using the function atan2,
:formula_16

This dihedral angle does not depend on the orientation of the chain (order in which the point are considered) — reversing this ordering consists of replacing each vector by its opposite vector, and exchanging the indices 1 and 3. Both operations do not change the cosine, but change the sign of the sine. Thus, together, they do not change the angle.

A simpler formula for the same dihedral angle is the following (the proof is given below)
:formula_17
or equivalently,
:formula_18

This can be deduced from previous formulas by using the vector quadruple product formula, and the fact that a scalar triple product is zero if it contains twice the same vector:
:formula_19

Given the definition of the cross product, this means that formula_3 is the angle in the clockwise direction of the fourth atom compared to the first atom, while looking down the axis from the second atom to the third. Special cases (one may say the usual cases) are formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23, which are called the &quot;trans&quot;, &quot;gauche+&quot;, and &quot;gauche−&quot; conformations.

==In stereochemistry==

In stereochemistry, a torsion angle is defined as a particular example of a dihedral angle, describing the geometric relation of two parts of a molecule joined by a chemical bond. Every set of three non-colinear atoms of a molecule defines a half-plane. As explained above, when two such half-planes intersect (i.e., a set of four consecutively-bonded atoms), the angle between them is a dihedral angle. Dihedral angles are used to specify the molecular conformation. Stereochemical arrangements corresponding to angles between 0° and ±90° are called &quot;syn&quot; (s), those corresponding to angles between ±90° and 180° &quot;anti&quot; (a). Similarly, arrangements corresponding to angles between 30° and 150° or between −30° and −150° are called &quot;clinal&quot; (c) and those between 0° and ±30° or ±150° and 180° are called &quot;periplanar&quot; (p).

The two types of terms can be combined so as to define four ranges of angle; 0° to ±30° synperiplanar (sp); 30° to 90° and −30° to −90° synclinal (sc); 90° to 150° and −90° to −150° anticlinal (ac); ±150° to 180° antiperiplanar (ap). The synperiplanar conformation is also known as the &quot;syn&quot;- or &quot;cis&quot;-conformation; antiperiplanar as &quot;anti&quot; or &quot;trans&quot;; and synclinal as &quot;gauche&quot; or &quot;skew&quot;.

For example, with &quot;n&quot;-butane two planes can be specified in terms of the two central carbon atoms and either of the methyl carbon atoms. The &quot;syn&quot;-conformation shown above, with a dihedral angle of 60° is less stable than the &quot;anti&quot;-conformation with a dihedral angle of 180°.

For macromolecular usage the symbols T, C, G+, G−, A+ and A− are recommended (ap, sp, +sc, −sc, +ac and −ac respectively).

===Proteins===

A Ramachandran plot (also known as a Ramachandran diagram or a [&quot;φ&quot;,&quot;ψ&quot;] plot), originally developed in 1963 by G. N. Ramachandran, C. Ramakrishnan, and V. Sasisekharan, is a way to visualize energetically allowed regions for backbone dihedral angles &quot;ψ&quot; against &quot;φ&quot; of amino acid residues in protein structure.
In a protein chain three dihedral angles are defined:
* ω (omega) is the angle in the chain Cα − C&#x27; − N − Cα,
* φ (phi) is the angle in the chain C&#x27; − N − Cα − C&#x27;
* ψ (psi) is the angle in the chain N − Cα − C&#x27; − N (called &quot;φ′&quot; by Ramachandran)

The figure at right illustrates the location of each of these angles (but it does not show correctly the way they are defined).

The planarity of the peptide bond usually restricts &quot;ω&quot; to be 180° (the typical &quot;trans&quot; case) or 0° (the rare &quot;cis&quot; case). The distance between the Cα atoms in the &quot;trans&quot; and &quot;cis&quot; isomers is approximately 3.8 and 2.9 Å, respectively. The vast majority of the peptide bonds in proteins are &quot;trans&quot;, though the peptide bond to the nitrogen of proline has an increased prevalence of &quot;cis&quot; compared to other amino-acid pairs.

The side chain dihedral angles are designated with &quot;χn&quot; (chi-&quot;n&quot;). They tend to cluster near 180°, 60°, and −60°, which are called the &quot;trans&quot;, &quot;gauche−&quot;, and &quot;gauche+&quot; conformations. The stability of certain sidechain dihedral angles is affected by the values &quot;φ&quot; and &quot;ψ&quot;. For instance, there are direct steric interactions between the C&quot;γ&quot; of the side chain in the &quot;gauche+&quot; rotamer and the backbone nitrogen of the next residue when &quot;ψ&quot; is near -60°. This is evident from statistical distributions in backbone-dependent rotamer libraries.

==Geometry==
Every polyhedron has a dihedral angle at every edge describing the relationship of the two faces that share that edge. This dihedral angle, also called the &quot;face angle&quot;, is measured as the internal angle with respect to the polyhedron. An angle of 0° means the face normal vectors are antiparallel and the faces overlap each other, which implies that it is part of a degenerate polyhedron. An angle of 180° means the faces are parallel, as in a tiling. An angle greater than 180° exists on concave portions of a polyhedron.

Every dihedral angle in an edge-transitive polyhedron has the same value. This includes the 5 Platonic solids, the 13 Catalan solids, the 4 Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra, the two quasiregular solids, and two quasiregular dual solids.

==Law of cosines for dihedral angle==
Given 3 faces of a polyhedron which meet at a common vertex P and have edges AP, BP and CP, the cosine of the dihedral angle between the faces containing APC and BPC is:
:formula_24
This can be deduced from the spherical law of cosines, but can also be found by other means.

<text>A spokesperson, spokesman, spokeswoman, or spox is someone engaged or elected to speak on behalf of others.

==Duties and function==
In the present media-sensitive world, many organizations are increasingly likely to employ professionals who have received formal training in journalism, communications, public relations and public affairs in this role in order to ensure that public announcements are made in the most appropriate fashion and through the most appropriate channels to maximize the impact of favorable messages and minimize the unfavorable.

Celebrity spokespeople such as popular athletes (such as Michael Jordan for Nike and Coca-Cola) or entertainers (such as Beyoncé for Pepsi and L&#x27;Oreal) are often chosen as spokespeople for commercial advertising.

==Responsibilities==
Unlike giving a personal testimonial, it is the job of spokespeople to faithfully represent and advocate for the organization&#x27;s positions, even when these conflict with their own opinion. As a result, spokespeople are generally selected from experienced, long-time employees or other people who are known to support the organization&#x27;s goals.

==Identity==
A corporation may be represented in public by its chief executive officer, chairperson or president, chief financial officer, counsel or external legal advisor. In addition, on a day-to-day level and for more routine announcements, the job may be delegated to the corporate communications or investor relations departments (or equivalents), who will act as spokespeople.

As an example, in the particle physics community, large collaborations of physicists elect one (or two) spokespeople or leader(s) of the collaboration. The spokesperson in such cases is the lead scientist of the collaboration, not a public speaker. Each collaboration chooses the roles and responsibilities of the spokesperson for internal purposes, but typically spokespeople also have defined roles for liaising with the host laboratory and/or funding agencies.

In certain governmental organizations (i.e. city, county, school district, state government and police/fire departments), a public information officer is the communications coordinator primarily responsible for providing information to the public through media, pursuant to and limited by any applicable laws.

<doc id="338051" wikidata="Q30587580" url="?curid=338051" title="Dehn invariant">
<text>In geometry, the Dehn invariant is a value used to determine whether one polyhedron can be cut into pieces and reassembled (&quot;dissected&quot;) into another, and whether a polyhedron or its dissections can tile space. It is named after Max Dehn, who used it to solve Hilbert&#x27;s third problem by proving that certain polyhedra with equal volume cannot be dissected into each other.

Two polyhedra have a dissection into polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled into either one, if and only if their volumes and Dehn invariants are equal. Having Dehn invariant zero is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for being a space-filling polyhedron, and a polyhedron can be cut up and reassembled into a space-filling polyhedron if and only if its Dehn invariant is zero. The Dehn invariant of a self-intersection-free flexible polyhedron is invariant as it flexes. Dehn invariants are also an invariant for dissection in higher dimensions, and (with volume) a complete invariant in four dimensions.

The Dehn invariant is zero for the cube but nonzero for the other Platonic solids, implying that the other solids cannot tile space and that they cannot be dissected into a cube. All of the Archimedean solids have Dehn invariants that are rational combinations of the invariants for the Platonic solids. In particular, the truncated octahedron also tiles space and has Dehn invariant zero like the cube.

The Dehn invariants of polyhedra are not numbers. Instead, they are elements of an infinite-dimensional tensor space. This space, viewed as an abelian group, is part of an exact sequence involving group homology. Similar invariants can also be defined for some other dissection puzzles, including the problem of dissecting rectilinear polygons into each other by axis-parallel cuts and translations.

==Background and history==

In two dimensions, the Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem from the early 19th century states that any two polygons of equal area can be cut up into polygonal pieces and reassembled into each other. In the late 19th century, David Hilbert became interested in this result. He used it as a way to axiomatize the area of two-dimensional polygons, in connection with Hilbert&#x27;s axioms for Euclidean geometry. This was part of a program to make the foundations of geometry more rigorous, by treating explicitly notions like area that Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; had handled more intuitively. Naturally, this raised the question of whether a similar axiomatic treatment could be extended to solid geometry.

At the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians, Hilbert formulated Hilbert&#x27;s problems, a set of problems that became very influential in 20th-century mathematics.
One of those, Hilbert&#x27;s third problem, addressed this question on the axiomatization of solid volume. Hilbert&#x27;s third problem asked, more specifically, whether every two polyhedra of equal volumes can always be cut into polyhedral pieces and reassembled into each other. If this were the case, then the volume of any polyhedron could be defined, axiomatically, as the volume of an equivalent cube into which it could be reassembled. However, the answer turned out to be negative: not all polyhedra can be dissected into cubes.

Unlike some of the other Hilbert problems, the answer to the third problem came very quickly. In fact, Raoul Bricard had already claimed it as a theorem in 1896, but with a proof that turned out to be incomplete. Hilbert&#x27;s student Max Dehn, in his 1900 habilitation thesis, invented the Dehn invariant in order to solve this problem. Dehn proved that, to be reassembled into each other, two polyhedra of equal volume should also have equal Dehn invariant, but he found two tetrahedra of equal volume whose Dehn invariants differed. This provided a negative solution to the problem. Although Dehn formulated his invariant differently,
the modern approach to Dehn&#x27;s invariant is to describe it as a value in a tensor product, following .

==Examples==
===Simplified calculation===
Defining the Dehn invariant in a way that can apply to all polyhedra simultaneously involves infinite-dimensional vector spaces (see , below). However, when restricted to any particular example consisting of finitely many polyhedra, such as the Platonic solids, it can be defined in a simpler way, involving only a finite number of dimensions, as follows:
*Determine the edge lengths and dihedral angles (the angle between two faces meeting along an edge) of all of the polyhedra.
*Find a subset of the angles that forms a rational basis. This means that each dihedral angle can be represented as a linear combination of basis elements, with rational number coefficients. Additionally, no rational linear combination of basis elements may sum to zero. Include formula_1 (or a rational multiple of formula_1) in this basis.
*For each edge of a polyhedron, represent its dihedral angle as a rational combination of angles from the basis. Discard the coefficient for the rational multiple of formula_1 in this combination. Interpret the remaining coefficients as the coordinates of a vector whose dimensions represent basis angles, and scale this vector by the edge length.
*Sum the vectors for all edges of a polyhedron to produce its Dehn invariant.

Although this method involves arbitrary choices of basis elements, these choices affect only the coefficients by which the Dehn invariants are represented. As elements of an abstract vector space, they are unaffected by the choice of basis. The vector space spanned by the Dehn invariants of any finite set of polyhedra forms a finite-dimensional subspace of the infinite-dimensional vector space in which the Dehn invariants of all polyhedra are defined. The question of which combinations of dihedral angles are related by rational linear combinations is not always straightforward, and may involve nontrivial methods from number theory.

===Platonic solids===
For the five Platonic solids, the dihedral angles are:
*formula_4 for the tetrahedron.
*formula_5, a right angle, for the cube.
*formula_6 for the octahedron.
*formula_7 for the dodecahedron, where formula_8 is the golden ratio.
*formula_9 for the icosahedron.
The dihedral angle of a cube is a rational multiple of formula_1, but the rest are not. The dihedral angles of the regular tetrahedron and regular octahedron are supplementary angles: they sum Omitting either the tetrahedron or the octahedron from these five angles produces a rational basis: there are no other rational relations between these angles. If, for instance, the basis that omits formula_11 is used, and formula_12 is used as a basis element but then omitted (as a rational multiple of formula_1) from the Dehn invariant calculation, then the remaining angle basis elements are formula_14, formula_15, and formula_16. The resulting Dehn invariants will have one dimension for each basis element. With this basis, for Platonic solids with edge length formula_17, the Dehn invariants are:/2&lt;/math&gt;, formula_18, and formula_19.}}
*formula_20 for the tetrahedron. It has six edges of length formula_17, with tetrahedral dihedral angles.
*formula_22 for the cube. Its edges have dihedral angles that are expressed only in terms of formula_12, omitted from the Dehn invariant.
*formula_24 for the octahedron. Its twelve edges have dihedrals formula_25. In this combination, the coefficient for formula_12 is discarded, leaving only a coefficient of formula_27 &lt;/math&gt;.}}
*formula_28 for the dodecahedron. It has 30 edges with dodecahedral dihedral angles.
*formula_29 for the icosahedron. It has 30 edges with icosahedral dihedral angles.

The cube is the only one of these whose Dehn invariant is zero. The Dehn invariants of each of the other four Platonic solids are unequal and nonzero. The Dehn invariant of the octahedron is formula_30 times the Dehn invariant of a tetrahedron of the same edge length.

===Related polyhedra===
The Dehn invariant of any parallelepiped is zero, just as it is for the cube. Each set of four parallel edges in a parallelepiped have the same length and have dihedral angles summing to formula_31, so their contributions to the Dehn invariant cancel out to zero. The Dehn invariants of the other Archimedean solids can also be expressed as rational combinations of the invariants of the Platonic solids. In terms of the same basis as before, with the same assumption that these shapes have edge length formula_17, the Dehn invariants are:
*formula_33 for the truncated tetrahedron.
*formula_34 for the truncated cube, rhombicuboctahedron, and cuboctahedron.
*formula_22 for the truncated octahedron, which tiles space as the bitruncated cubic honeycomb.
*formula_36 for the truncated dodecahedron.
*formula_37 for the truncated icosahedron.
*formula_38 for the icosidodecahedron.
*formula_39 for the rhombicosidodecahedron.
*formula_22 for the truncated icosidodecahedron. This does not tile space directly, but as a zonohedron it can be partitioned into parallelepipeds, which do.

==Applications==
As observed, the Dehn invariant is an invariant for the dissection of polyhedra, in the sense that cutting up a polyhedron into smaller polyhedral pieces and then reassembling them into a different polyhedron does not change the Dehn invariant of the result. If a new edge is introduced in this cutting process, then either it is interior to the polyhedron, and surrounded by dihedral angles totaling formula_31, or on a face of the polyhedron, and surrounded by dihedrals totaling formula_1; in either case this rational multiple of formula_1 does not contribute to the Dehn invariant. A similar analysis shows that there is also no change in the Dehn invariant when an existing polyhedron edge is the boundary of a new face created when cutting up the polyhedron. The new dihedral angles on that edge combine to the same sum, and the same contribution to the Dehn invariant, that they had before. Another invariant of dissection is the volume of a polyhedron: cutting it up into polyhedral pieces and reassembling the pieces cannot change the total volume. Therefore, if one polyhedron has a dissection into another polyhedron , both and must have the same Dehn invariant as well as the same volume. extended this result by proving that the volume and the Dehn invariant are the only invariants for this problem. If and both have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant, it is always possible to dissect one into the other.

The Dehn invariant also constrains the ability of a polyhedron to tile space. Every space-filling tile has Dehn invariant zero, like the cube. For polyhedra that tile space periodically this would follow by using the periodicity of the tiling to cut and rearrange the tile into a parallelepiped with the same periodicity, but this result holds as well for aperiodic tiles like the Schmitt–Conway–Danzer biprism. The reverse of this is not true – there exist polyhedra with Dehn invariant zero that do not tile space. However, these can always be dissected into another shape (the cube) that does tile space. The truncated icosidodecahedron is an example.

Dehn&#x27;s result continues to be valid for spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry. In both of those geometries, two polyhedra that can be cut and reassembled into each other must have the same Dehn invariant. However, as Jessen observed, the extension of Sydler&#x27;s result to spherical or hyperbolic geometry remains open: it is not known whether two spherical or hyperbolic polyhedra with the same volume and the same Dehn invariant can always be cut and reassembled into each other. Every hyperbolic manifold with finite volume can be cut along geodesic surfaces into a hyperbolic polyhedron (a fundamental domain for the fundamental group of the manifold), which tiles the universal cover of the manifold and therefore necessarily has zero Dehn invariant.

More generally, if some combination of polyhedra jointly tiles space, then the sum of their Dehn invariants (taken in the same proportion) must be zero. For instance, the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb is a tiling of space by tetrahedra and octahedra (with twice as many tetrahedra as octahedra), corresponding to the fact that the sum of the Dehn invariants of an octahedron and two tetrahedra (with the same side lengths) is zero.

==Full definition==
===As a tensor product===
The definition of the Dehn invariant requires a notion of a polyhedron for which the lengths and dihedral angles of edges are well defined. Most commonly, it applies to the polyhedra whose boundaries are piecewise linear manifolds, embedded on a finite number of planes in Euclidean space. However, the Dehn invariant has also been considered for polyhedra in spherical geometry or in hyperbolic space, and for certain self-crossing polyhedra in Euclidean space.

The values of the Dehn invariant belong to an abelian group defined as the tensor product
formula_44
The left factor of this tensor product is the set of real numbers (in this case representing lengths of edges of polyhedra) and the right factor represents dihedral angles in radians, given as numbers modulo rational multiples of 2. (Some sources take the angles modulo instead of or divide the angles by and use formula_45 in place but this makes no difference to the resulting tensor product, as any rational multiple of in the right factor becomes zero in the product.)

The Dehn invariant of a polyhedron with edge lengths formula_46 and edge dihedral angles formula_47 is the sum
formula_48

Its structure as a tensor gives the Dehn invariant additional properties that are geometrically meaningful. In particular, it has a tensor rank, the minimum number of terms formula_49 in any expression as a sum of such terms. Since the expression of the Dehn invariant as a sum over edges of a polyhedron has exactly this form, the rank of the Dehn invariant gives a lower bound on the minimum number of edges possible for any polyhedron resulting from a dissection of a given polyhedron.

===Using a Hamel basis===
An alternative but equivalent description of the Dehn invariant involves the choice of a Hamel basis, an infinite subset formula_50 of the real numbers such that every real number can be expressed uniquely as a sum of finitely many rational multiples of elements of formula_50. Thus, as an additive group, formula_52 is isomorphic to formula_53, the direct sum of copies of formula_54 with one summand for each element of formula_50. If formula_50 is chosen to have (or a rational multiple of ) is one of its elements, and formula_57 is the rest of the basis with this element excluded, then the tensor product formula_58 can be described as the (infinite dimensional) real vector space formula_59. The Dehn invariant can be expressed by decomposing each dihedral angle formula_47 into a finite sum of basis elements
formula_61
where formula_62 is rational, formula_63 is one of the real numbers in the Hamel basis, and these basis elements are numbered so that formula_64 is the rational multiple of 
that belongs to formula_50 but not formula_57. With this decomposition,
the Dehn invariant is
formula_67
where each formula_68 is the standard unit vector in formula_59 corresponding to the basis element formula_63. The sum here starts at formula_71, to omit the term corresponding to the rational multiples of .

This alternative formulation shows that the values of the Dehn invariant can be given the additional structure of a real vector space. Although, in general, the construction of Hamel bases involves the axiom of choice, this can be avoided (when considering any specific finite set of polyhedra) by restricting attention to the finite-dimensional vector space generated over formula_54 by the dihedral angles of the polyhedra.

===Hyperbolic polyhedra with infinite edge lengths===
For an ideal polyhedron in hyperbolic space, the edge lengths are infinite, making the usual definition of the Dehn invariant inapplicable. Nevertheless, the Dehn invariant can be extended to these polyhedra by using horospheres to truncate their vertices, and computing the Dehn invariant in the usual way for the resulting truncated shape, ignoring the extra curved edges created by this truncation process. The result does not depend on the choice of horospheres for the truncation, as long as each one cuts off only a single vertex of the given polyhedron.

==Realizability==
Although the Dehn invariant takes values in formula_73 not all of the elements in this space can be realized as the Dehn invariants of polyhedra.
The Dehn invariants of Euclidean polyhedra form a real linear subspace of formula_74: one can add the Dehn invariants of polyhedra by taking the disjoint union of the polyhedra (or gluing them together on a face), negate Dehn invariants by making holes in the shape of the polyhedron in large cubes, and multiply the Dehn invariant by any positive real scalar by scaling the polyhedron by the same number.
The question of which elements of formula_73 are realizable was clarified by the work of Dupont and Sah, who showed the existence of the following exact sequence of abelian groups (not vector spaces) involving group homology:
formula_76
Here, the notation formula_77 represents the free abelian group over Euclidean polyhedra modulo certain relations derived from pairs of polyhedra that can be dissected into each other.
formula_78 is the subgroup generated in this group by the triangular prisms, and is used here to represent volume (as each real number is the volume of exactly one element of this group). The map from the group of polyhedra to formula_74 is the Dehn invariant.
formula_80 is the Euclidean point rotation group, and formula_81 is the group homology.
Sydler&#x27;s theorem that volume and the Dehn invariant are the only invariants for Euclidean dissection is represented homologically by the statement that the group formula_82 appearing in this sequence is the trivial group (represented elsewhere in the sequence by the notation 0).
If it were nontrivial, its image in the group of polyhedra would give a family of polyhedra that are not dissectable to a cube of the same volume but that have zero Dehn invariant. By Sydler&#x27;s theorem, such polyhedra do not exist.

The group formula_83 appearing towards the right of the exact sequence is isomorphic to the group formula_84 of Kähler differentials,
and the map from tensor products of lengths and angles to Kähler differentials is given by
formula_85
where formula_86 is the universal derivation formula_87 (or formula_88).
This group formula_89 is an obstacle to realizability: its nonzero elements come from elements of formula_74 that cannot be realized as Dehn invariants. Jessen notes, more specifically, that the rank-one tensor formula_49 can be realized as a Dehn invariant if and only if formula_92 is an algebraic number. Matthias Görner has conjectured that, when a tensor of this form is realizable as a Dehn invariant, it can be realized by a polyhedron having a single dihedral angle of length formula_93 and dihedral angle formula_94, with all other angles right angles, but this is known only for a limited set of dihedral angles.

In hyperbolic or spherical space, the realizable Dehn invariants do not necessarily form a vector space, because scalar multiplication is no longer possible. However, they still form a subgroup of the tensor product in which they are elements. Analogously, Dupont and Sah prove the existence of the exact sequences
formula_95
and
formula_96
Here formula_97 denotes the special linear group, and formula_98 is the group of Möbius transformations; the superscript minus-sign indicates the (−1)-eigenspace for the involution induced by complex conjugation. formula_99 denotes the special unitary group.
The subgroup formula_100 in formula_101 is the group generated by the whole sphere. Again, the rightmost nonzero group in these sequences is the obstacle to realizability of a value in formula_74 as a Dehn invariant.

This algebraic view of the Dehn invariant can be extended to higher dimensions, where it has a motivic interpretation involving algebraic K-theory. In four dimensions, the group of polyhedra modulo dissections is isomorphic to the three-dimensional group. Every four-dimensional polytope can be dissected to a prism over a three-dimensional polytope, and two four-dimensional polytopes can be dissected to each other when their volumes and Dehn invariants are equal. In dimensions higher than four, it remains open whether the existence of dissections is completely described by volumes and Dehn invariants, or whether other information is needed to determine whether a dissection exists.

==Related results==

An approach very similar to the Dehn invariant can be used to determine whether two rectilinear polygons can be dissected into each other only using axis-parallel cuts and translations (rather than cuts at arbitrary angles and rotations). An invariant for this kind of dissection uses the tensor product formula_103
where the left and right terms in the product represent height and width of rectangles. The invariant for any given polygon is calculated by cutting the polygon into rectangles, taking the tensor product of the height and width of each rectangle, and adding the results. A dissection is possible if and only if two polygons have the same invariant, which implies that they also have equal areas. This invariant can be used to prove another result of Dehn from 1903: two rectangles of the same area can be dissected into each other if and only if their aspect ratios are rational multiples of each other. It follows that a polyomino formed from a union of formula_104 squares can only be dissected in this way to a square when formula_104 is a square number. For this version of the Dehn invariant, the tensor rank equals the minimum number of rectangles into which a polygon can be dissected.

Flexible polyhedra are a class of polyhedra that can undergo a continuous motion that preserves the shape of their faces. By Cauchy&#x27;s rigidity theorem, they must be non-convex, and it is known (the &quot;bellows theorem&quot;) that the volume of the polyhedron must stay constant throughout this motion. A stronger version of this theorem states that the Dehn invariant of such a polyhedron must also remain invariant throughout any continuous motion. This result is called the &quot;strong bellows theorem&quot;. It has been proven for all non-self-intersecting flexible polyhedra. However, for more complicated flexible polyhedra with self-intersections the Dehn invariant may change continuously as the polyhedron flexes.

The total mean curvature of a smooth surface can be generalized to polyhedral surfaces using a definition similar to the Dehn invariant, as the sum over the edges of the edge lengths multiplied by the exterior dihedral angles. It has also been proven to remain constant for any flexing polyhedron.

<text>Newport ( ) is a city and county borough in Wales, situated on the River Usk close to its confluence with the Severn Estuary, northeast of Cardiff. The population grew considerably between the 2011 and the 2021 census, rising from 145,700 to 159,587, the largest growth of any unitary authority in Wales. Newport is the third-largest principal authority with city status in Wales, and sixth most populous overall. Newport became a unitary authority in 1996 and forms part of the Cardiff-Newport metropolitan area, and the Cardiff Capital Region.

Newport has been a port since medieval times when the first Newport Castle was built by the Normans. The town outgrew the earlier Roman town of Caerleon, immediately upstream and now part of the city. Newport gained its first charter in 1314. It grew significantly in the 19th century when its port became the focus of coal exports from the eastern South Wales Valleys. Newport was the largest coal exporter in Wales until the rise of Cardiff in the mid-1800s. Newport was the site of the last large-scale armed insurrection in Great Britain, the Newport Rising of 1839.

In the 20th century, the docks declined in importance, but Newport remained an important centre for manufacturing and engineering. Latterly its economy has been bolstered as part of the M4 corridor high-technology cluster. It was granted city status in 2002. The Celtic Manor Resort in Newport hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010 and was the venue for the 2014 NATO summit. The city contains extensive rural areas surrounding the built-up core. Its villages are of considerable archaeological importance. Newport Cathedral is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Monmouth and is the cathedral of the Diocese of Monmouth.

==Toponymy==
The original Welsh name for the city was (pronounced ). This is a contraction of the name , which translates as &#x27;new castle on the Usk&#x27;. The Welsh name is recorded in the when it was visited by Henry II of England sometime around 1172. &quot;New castle&quot; suggests a pre-existing fortification in the vicinity and is most likely either to reference the ancient fort on Stow Hill, or a fort that occupied the site of the present castle.

The English name &#x27;Newport&#x27; is a later application. The settlement was first recorded by the Normans as in 1126. This Latin name refers to the new borough (or town) established with the Norman castle. The origin of the name &quot;Newport&quot; and the reason for its wide adoption remains the subject of debate. &quot;Newport-on-Usk&quot; is found on some early maps, and the name was in popular usage well before the development of Newport Docks. One theory suggests that &quot;Newport&quot; gained favour with medieval maritime traders on the Usk, as it differentiated the &quot;New port&quot; from the &quot;Old Roman port&quot; at Caerleon.

==History==
===Early history===

Bronze Age fishermen settled around the fertile estuary of the River Usk and later the Celtic Silures built hillforts overlooking it. In AD 75, on the very edge of their empire, the Roman legions built a Roman fort at Caerleon to defend the river crossing. According to legend, in the late 5th century Saint Gwynllyw (Woolos), the patron saint of Newport and King of Gwynllwg founded the church which would become Newport Cathedral. The church was certainly in existence by the 9th century and today has become the seat of the Bishop of Monmouth. In 1049/50, a fleet of Orkney Vikings, under Welsh king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, sailed up the Usk and sacked St Gwynllyw&#x27;s church. The church suffered a similar fate in 1063, when Harold Godwinson attacked south Wales. The Normans arrived from around 1088–1093 to build the first Newport Castle and river crossing downstream from Caerleon and the first Norman Lord of Newport was Robert Fitzhamon.

The original Newport Castle was a small motte-and-bailey castle in the park opposite Newport Cathedral. It was buried in rubble excavated from the Hillfield railway tunnels that were dug under Stow Hill in the 1840s and no part of it is currently visible.

===Norman invasion and early modern Newport===
Around the settlement, the new town grew to become Newport, obtaining its first charter in 1314 and was granted a second one, by Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford in 1385 (the Newport coat of arms reflects those of the Staffords: theirs was a red chevron - pointing upwards- on a gold field, Newport&#x27;s is a red chevron reversed - pointing downward - on the same background.) In the 14th century Augustinian friars came to Newport where they built an isolation hospital for infectious diseases. After its closure the hospital lived on in the place name &quot;Spytty Fields&quot; (a corruption of &quot;ysbyty&quot;, the Welsh for hospital). &quot;Austin Friars&quot; also remains a street name in the city.

During the Last War for Welsh Independence in 1402 Rhys Gethin, General for Owain Glyndŵr, forcibly took Newport Castle together with those at Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly, Caerleon and Usk. During the raid the town of Newport was badly burned and Saint Woolos church destroyed.

A third charter, establishing the right of the town to run its own market and commerce came from Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham in 1426. By 1521, Newport was described as having &quot;...a good haven coming into it, well occupied with small crays [merchant ships] where a very great ship may resort and have good harbour.&quot; Trade was thriving with the nearby ports of Bristol and Bridgwater and industries included leather tanning, soap making and starch making. The town&#x27;s craftsmen included bakers, butchers, brewers, carpenters and blacksmiths. A further charter was granted by James I in 1623.

During the English Civil War in 1648 Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s troops camped overnight on Christchurch Hill overlooking the town before their attack on the castle the next day. A cannonball dug up from a garden in nearby Summerhill Avenue, dating from this time, now rests in Newport Museum.

===Industrial Revolution===

As the Industrial Revolution transformed Britain in the 19th century, the South Wales Valleys became key suppliers of coal from the South Wales Coalfield, and iron. These were transported down local rivers and the new canals to ports such as Newport, and Newport Docks grew rapidly as a result. Newport became one of the largest towns in Wales and the focus for the new industrial eastern valleys of South Wales. By 1830 Newport was Wales&#x27; leading coal port, and until the 1850s it was larger than Cardiff.

The Newport Rising in 1839 was the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in mainland Britain. John Frost and 3,000 other Chartists marched on the Westgate Hotel at the centre of the town, where chartists were being held prisoner, with some of the chartists being armed. Shooting began between the chartists and the 45th Regiment of Foot, which had been called to the town by the Mayor, Thomas Phillips, to assist the police. At least 20 chartists were killed and were later buried in Saint Woolos churchyard. Thomas Philips and three of those in the hotel were wounded. John Frost was sentenced to death for treason, but this was later commuted to transportation to Australia. He returned to Britain (but not to Newport) later in his life. John Frost Square (1977), in the centre of the city, is named in his honour.

Newport probably had a Welsh-speaking majority until the 1830s, but with a large influx of migrants from England and Ireland over the following decades, the town and the rest of Monmouthshire came to be seen as &quot;un-Welsh&quot;, a view compounded by ambiguity about the status of Monmouthshire. In the 19th century, the St George Society of Newport (a group largely consisting of English settlers and businessmen) asserted that the town was part of England. It was at a meeting in Newport, attended by future Prime Minister David Lloyd George, that the Cymru Fydd movement received its death-blow in 1896 when politician Robert Bird stated: &quot;You will find, from Swansea to Newport, a cosmopolitan population who will not submit to the domination of Welsh ideas!&quot;. Lloyd George was to suffer a further blow in Newport, when the South Wales Liberal Federation, led by David Alfred Thomas, an industrialist and Liberal politician, and Robert Bird moved that Lloyd George &quot;be not heard&quot; in the 1895 General Election. The Conservative capture of the recently created Newport constituency in a by-election in 1922 was one of the causes of the fall of his coalition government.

The late 19th and early 20th century period was a boom time for Newport. The Alexandra Docks opened in 1875. The population was expanding rapidly and the town became a county borough in 1891. In 1892 the Alexandra South Dock was opened and was the largest masonry dock in the world. Although coal exports from Newport were by now modest compared to the Port of Cardiff (which included Cardiff, Penarth and Barry), Newport was the place where the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain was founded in 1889, and international trade was sufficiently large for 8 consuls and 14 vice-consuls to be based in the town. In 1898 Lysaght&#x27;s Orb Works opened and by 1901 employed 3,000 staff. Urban expansion took in Pillgwenlly and Lliswerry to the south; this eventually necessitated a new crossing of the River Usk, which was provided by the Newport Transporter Bridge completed in 1906, described as &quot;Newport&#x27;s greatest treasure&quot;.

Further extensions to the South Dock were opened in 1907 and 1914. The Newport Docks Disaster occurred on 2 July 1909 when, during the construction of the new south lock connecting the South Dock to the Severn Estuary, supporting timbers in an excavation trench collapsed and buried 46 workers. Rescuers included a 12-year-old paperboy, Thomas &#x27;Toya&#x27; Lewis, who was small enough to crawl into the collapsed trench. He worked for two hours trying to free one of the trapped men, who was finally released the next day. A public subscription raised several hundred pounds and Lewis was sent on an engineering scholarship. He was also awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving by King Edward VII. Memorials to the dead are in St Mark&#x27;s Church, close to the centre of the city. A pub in the city centre was named &quot;The Tom Toya Lewis&quot; in his honour, but closed in 2021. The building in which the pub was housed was formerly the Newport YMCA, the foundation stone for which was laid by Viscount Tredegar in 1909.

From 1893 the town was served by the paddle steamers of P &amp; A Campbell Ltd. (the &quot;White Funnel Line&quot;), which was based in Bristol. The company had originally been set up by the Scottish brothers Alex and Peter Campbell on the River Clyde, but was re-located to the Severn Estuary. Departing steamers would face south on Davis Wharf, with the Art College to its left and the town bridge behind. The boats gave rise to the name of the short street which led to the quayside – Screwpacket Road. By 1955 steamers had stopped calling at Newport and P &amp; A Campbell went into receivership in 1959. It was taken over by the firm which would become the Townsend Ferry group.

Compared to many Welsh towns, Newport&#x27;s economy had a broad base, with foundries, engineering works, a cattle market and shops that served much of Monmouthshire. However, the docks were in decline even before the Great Depression, and local unemployment peaked at 34.7% in 1930: high, but not as bad as the levels seen in the mining towns of the South Wales Valleys. Despite the economic conditions, the council re-housed over half the population in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1930 the Town Dock was filled in.
The post-war years saw renewed prosperity, with Saint Woolos&#x27; Cathedral (now Newport Cathedral) attaining full cathedral status in 1949, the opening of the modern integrated Llanwern steelworks in 1962, and the construction of the Severn Bridge and local sections of the M4 motorway in the late 1960s, making Newport the best-connected place in Wales. Although employment at Llanwern steelworks declined in the 1980s, the town acquired a range of new public sector employers, and a Richard Rogers–designed Inmos microprocessor factory helped to establish Newport as a centre for technology companies.

A flourishing local music scene in the early 1990s led to claims that the town was &quot;a new Seattle&quot;.

The county borough of Newport was granted city status in 2002 to mark Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. In the same year, an unusually large merchant ship, referred to locally as the Newport Ship, was uncovered and rescued from the west bank of the River Usk during the construction of the Riverfront Arts Centre. The ship has been dated to between 1445 and 1469 and remains the only vessel of its type from this period yet discovered anywhere in the world.

==Governance and Politics==
:&quot;See also :Category:Politics of Newport, Wales&quot;
Newport has long been the largest town in the historic county of Monmouthshire and a county borough between 1891 and 1974. The Local Government Act 1972 removed ambiguity about the legal status of the area by including the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport into all acts pertaining to Wales. In 1974, the borough was incorporated into the new local government county of Gwent until Newport became a unitary authority again in 1996. Gwent remains in use for ceremonial functions as a preserved county.

Newport was historically industrialised with a large working class population and strong support for the Labour Party.

The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1972, from the county borough of Newport, the Caerleon Urban District and Magor and St Mellons Rural District (except the parishes of Henllys and St Mellons) from the administrative county of Monmouthshire.

In 1996 the district under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 it became a unitary authority.

The right to use the armorial bearings of the Newport Corporation which were lost when the corporation was abolished on 1 April 1974 were only officially transferred to the new authority on 14 March 1996, some 18 days before it too was abolished. The present city council was awarded the right to use the arms on 26 July 1996.

=== Council ===
Newport City Council consists of 53 elected councillors. The Labour Party won the 2022 Newport City Council election with 35 seats, ahead of the Conservative Party with 7 seats.

The Labour Party lost control of Newport council in the 2008 local elections to a Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition but the Labour Party regained an overall majority of councillors in the 2012 election until the present day.

=== Senedd ===
In the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), Newport is divided between the Senedd constituencies of Newport East and Newport West and elects one Member of the Senedd (MS) in each constituency. In the 2021 Senedd election, the Labour Party retained both Newport East and Newport West.

In Senedd elections the Labour Party has held both the Newport East and Newport West constituencies since the constituencies were created in 1999.

=== UK Parliament ===
In UK General Elections the City of Newport is in two UK Parliament constituencies. Due to boundary changes the Newport West constituency was renamed Newport West and Islwyn for the 2024 United Kingdom general election. In 2024 the Labour Party won both the expanded Newport East constituency and the new Newport West and Islwyn constituency.

Until 2024 The City of Newport was divided between the UK Parliament constituencies of Newport East and Newport West and elected one Member of Parliament (MP) in each constituency. The Labour Party held Newport East since constituency boundaries were redrawn in 1983 and held Newport West since 1987.

The city formerly had only one constituency Newport (Monmouthshire) (UK Parliament constituency) until 1983 when the city was split into Newport East and Newport West due to population growth.

=== European Parliament ===
Prior to Brexit in 2020, Newport was part of the Wales European Parliament Constituency. The Wales constituency elected four Members of the European Parliament (MEP) on a Proportional representation basis. In the 2019 European Parliament election the Wales constituency elected one MEP from the Labour Party, one from Plaid Cymru and two from the Brexit Party.

=== Elected Representatives ===
===Coat of arms===

The official blazon of the armorial bearings is: &quot;(arms) Or, a chevron reversed gules, the shield ensigned by a cherub proper. Supporters: on the dexter side a winged sea lion Or, and on the sinister side a sea dragon gules, the nether parts of both proper, finned gold.&quot;

===Freedom of the City===
The title of Freedom of Newport is a ceremonial honour, given by the Newport council to those who have served in some exceptional capacity, or upon any whom Newport wishes to bestow an honour. There have been 17 individuals or organisations that have received the honour since 1909, including:

*Godfrey Charles Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar, Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire
*Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein (1945)
*Corps of the South Wales Borderers (24th Foot)
*Royal Regiment of Wales (24th/41st Foot)
*104th Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers)
*Royal Welch Fusiliers (2001)
*British Merchant Navy Association
*HMS Severn (2006)
*Newport County A.F.C. (2013)
*Newport R.F.C. (2013)
*Royal British Legion (2021)

==Geography==
Newport is located west of London and east of Cardiff. It is the largest urban area within the historic county boundaries of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent. The City of Newport, which includes rural areas as well as the built up area, is the sixth most populous unitary authority in Wales.

The city is largely low-lying, but with a few hilly areas. Wentwood is above sea level. Areas in the south and east of the city tend to be flat and fertile with some housing estates and industrial areas reclaimed from marshland. Areas near the banks of the River Usk, such as Caerleon, are also low-lying. The eastern outskirts of the city are characterised by the gently rolling hills of the Vale of Usk and Christchurch has panoramic views of the Vale of Usk and the Bristol Channel. Ridgeway at Allt-yr-yn also has good views of the surrounding areas and Bristol Channel. Brynglas has views over the city centre and Twmbarlwm to the west. The suburbs of the city have grown outwards from the inner-city, mostly near the main roads, giving the suburban sprawl of the city an irregular shape. The urban area is continuing to expand rapidly with new housing estates continuing to be built.

The city boundaries include a number of villages in the Newport Built-up area.

===Wards and districts===
:&quot;See also :Category:Districts of Newport, Wales&quot;
The city is divided into 21 wards. Most of these wards are coterminous with communities (parishes) of the same name. Each community can have an elected council. The following table lists city council wards, communities and associated geographical areas.

&quot;*&quot; communities with a community council.

===Climate===

Newport has a moderate temperate climate, with the weather rarely staying the same for more than a few days at a time. The city is one of the sunnier locations in Wales and its sheltered location tends to protect it from extreme weather. Like the whole of the British Isles, Newport benefits from the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Newport has mild summers and cool winters.

Thunderstorms may occur intermittently at any time of year, but are most common throughout late-spring and summer. Rain falls throughout the year, Atlantic storms give significant rainfall in the autumn, these gradually becoming rarer towards the end of winter. Autumn and summer have often been the wettest seasons in recent times. Snow falls in most winters and sometimes settles on the ground, usually melting within a few days. Newport records few days with gales compared to most of Wales, again due to its sheltered location. Frosts are common from October to May.

On 20 March 1930, the overnight temperature fell to the coldest temperature for the whole of the UK during that year, and the latest date in spring the UK&#x27;s lowest temperature has been recorded.

==Demography==

===Religion===

In 1929 St Woolos Church became the Pro-Cathedral of the Diocese of Monmouth, becoming a full cathedral in 1949. When Rowan Williams was appointed Archbishop of Wales in 2000, the Cathedral became the Metropolitan Cathedral of Wales, as it had when previous Bishops of Monmouth were elected Archbishop.

In 1850 Newport was recognised as a centre of Catholicism in Wales when the Diocese of Newport and Menevia was created. Between 21 October 1966 and 6 October 1969, having retired as Bishop of Rochester, New York, Fulton J. Sheen, an American bishop who pioneered preaching on television and radio, was appointed the titular archbishop of Newport by Pope Paul VI. The Catholic St Patrick&#x27;s Church was served by the Rosminians until the 2010s.

The foundation of the Charles Street Baptist Church was mainly the project of three women who had been members of Bethesda Baptist Chapel in Rogerstone, which was first built in 1742. In 1807 a Mrs Samuel and her friends rented a room in John Rowe&#x27;s house on Stow Hill and asked the preachers John Hier, and his subordinate James Edmunds, both from Bethesda, to preach to them there. They later moved to a larger room in Charles Street. In 1816 a meeting at the Castleton Baptist Association agreed to build the first Welsh Baptist Chapel in Newport. Land was acquired in Charles Street, with the help of a bequest from Newport tailor John Williams. In May 1817 the opening services of the new church were held. By July 1879 the decline in Welsh-speaking in the town led to a change in the services from Welsh to English. In September 1993, the Charles Street congregation joined with Ebbw Bridge Baptist Church, Newport, and the Charles Street Chapel closed.
In the 2011 census 56.8% of Newport residents considered themselves Christian, 4.7% Muslim, 1.2% Other religions (including Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jewish and Others), 29.7% were non-religious and 7.5% chose not to answer the non-compulsory religion question on the census.

Newport has more than 50 churches, 7 mosques, and one synagogue; the nearest Gurudwara is in Cardiff.

The Church in Wales church of St Julius and St Aaron, at St Julian&#x27;s, was consecrated in 1926.

The following table shows the religious identity of residents residing in Newport according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses.

=== Ethnicity ===
In the 2011 census, 89.9% described themselves as White, 5.5% Asian, 1.7% Black, 1.1% Mixed White/Black, 0.5% Mixed White/Asian and 1.4% as other ethnic groups. In the 2021 census, Whites had decreased to 85.6% of the population while all other groups increased bar Black Caribbeans.
==Economy==

Newport&#x27;s travel to work area incorporates much of south Monmouthshire; the new 2001-based area also includes Cwmbran. The city itself has three major centres for employment: the city centre, and business parks clustered around the M4 motorway junctions 24 in the east and 28 in the west.

Organisations based in the city include Airbus Defence and Space; the headquarters of the Office for National Statistics; the headquarters of the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (formerly known as the Patent Office); the General Insurance Division of Lloyds TSB; a large Panasonic manufacturing plant; a manufacturing plant for International Rectifier; the headquarters of insurance comparison site Gocompare; the headquarters of Wales and West Utilities; the shared-service centre for HM Prison Service; the Passport Office for much of the south and west of the UK; and the Wales headquarters of the Charity Commission and British Red Cross. In 2014 Admiral Insurance opened a large newly constructed office opposite Newport railway station.

In 1997, Newport secured what was then thought to be Europe&#x27;s largest-ever inward investment when the LG Group announced a £1.7 billion project creating 6,100 jobs, and supported by public sector grants. Facilities were built on the Celtic Lakes business and science park, but market conditions led to the semiconductor plant never opening, and the CRT plant eventually closed in 2003. In 2005 Irish radiator manufacturer Quinn Group bought the former LG Phillips building, which became its European base.

Industry in the east of Newport was formerly based at the Corus Llanwern steelworks, and although the rolling mill is still active, steel manufacture ceased in 2001. Permission has been granted to transform the former steelworks site into a £1bn mixed-use development comprising housing, office and industrial space, public open space and a range of community facilities.

At the mouth of the River Usk, the Sims Metal Management plant hosts the world&#x27;s largest industrial shredder for scrap metal with access by road, rail and sea. The plant, which is also the world&#x27;s largest car crusher which was featured in the TV series &#x27;How do they do it&#x27;.

Newport Cattle Market, in the Pillgwenlly area of the city, closed in 2009 and was demolished to make way for a new supermarket.

On 17 February 2024 workers from Llanwern steelworks marched in the city centre to protest at the proposed loss of thousands of steel jobs at Port Talbot.

==Regeneration==

The city has seen major regeneration projects being undertaken in recent years.

===Infrastructure===
The first stage of regeneration involved improving the city centre road network, turning Kingsway and Queensway into boulevards. The Southern Distributor Road to the south of the city opened in 2004, including the new City Bridge over the River Usk, improving access and opening up new areas for development. The Newport City footbridge opened in 2006 linking the east and west banks of the river for pedestrians and cyclists.

Newport railway station was expanded in 2007 to four full size platforms capable of receiving 10 car Intercity Express Programme services to and from London Paddington. In 2010 a new station building was finished, carried out by engineering firm Atkins. During construction it was Wales&#x27; most environmentally friendly station work, using a hypermodern green ETFE structure similar to the materials used in the Eden Project and the Beijing Olympics&#x27; &#x27;Water Cube&#x27;. In 2019 railway electrification and resigning work was completed, completing the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line and reducing journey times to London to 1 hour 30 minutes.

Newport bus station was redeveloped in 2013, expanded in 2015 with the Friars Walk development, and now offers 24 stands connecting to the rest of the city, as well as Cardiff and Bristol. Local railway stations are reopening, starting with Rogerstone station in 2008, Pye Corner station in 2014, and with three others planned in the city&#x27;s Unitary Development Plan. Transport for Wales intend to restart services between Newport and Ebbw Vale Parkway by 2021.

The Royal Gwent Hospital was downgraded to a minor injuries unit in 2020 when the new Grange University Hospital (Welsh: &quot;Ysbyty Athrofaol Y Faenor&quot;) was opened at Llanfrechfa, near Cwmbrân. There had been proposals to use the former Corus steel Whiteheads site, close to the existing Royal Gwent site, for a replacement hospital but this was considered to have the same access and space restrictions as the current hospital. It was decided to redevelop the Llanfrechfa Grange Hospital site, a former mental health and disabilities residential centre near Cwmbran, as a specialist and critical care unit.

The M4 relief road skirting the southern edge of the urban area of Newport was proposed as a means of reducing the congestion on the existing M4 motorway (presently squeezed through the Brynglas Tunnels) and making Newport and the surrounding areas more accessible for motorised vehicles. The relief road scheme was cancelled in July 2009 but relaunched in 2014. A final decision not to proceed with the scheme was announced by the then First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford AM, on 4 June 2019.

===Leisure===

The Riverfront Arts Centre was the first structure to be built as part of Newport&#x27;s regeneration by Newport City Council in 2004. It stands on Kingsway on the west bank of the River Usk. On the east bank, Rodney Parade is home to the regional United Rugby Championship (rugby union) team Dragons and the football team Newport County AFC. Club rugby union side Newport RFC play some home games at the ground (it was their home from 1877 to 2016) but reotherwise based at Newport Stadium in Spytty.

===Residential===
Newport witnessed the fastest growth in property values in the UK during 2018,

As part of the city&#x27;s master plan, the city centre has been expanded to take in areas of the River Usk east bank, with the area of land between Newport Bridge and George Street Bridge part of an ongoing a £43 million high-density combined commercial and residential area, joined to the west bank by the new footbridge. The plan is designed to show a strong urban form along the riverfront, emphasised with tall landmark buildings. The first phase has been labelled City Vizion.

The Newport Student Village is adjacent to the university campus on the west bank, as well as the &quot;Newhaus&quot; development of 154 riverside apartments. At the southern end of the site, the &quot;Alexandra Gate&quot; development includes 300 homes and riverside apartments built adjacent to the City Bridge.

In east Newport, land released from the Corus steelworks at Llanwern is being redeveloped as 4,000 houses, shops and other facilities.

===Commercial===

The Newport retail environment faced challenges following the late-2000s recession, with major redevelopment projects heavily delayed.

Friars Walk shopping complex was first planned as a £210m development ahead of the 2010 Ryder Cup, but faced numerous setbacks. The site opened to the public in November 2015 helped by £90m of assistance from Newport Council to the developers, with the Debenhams flagship store. As well as 30 new shops, there are a dozen restaurants and an eight-screen Cineworld multiplex cinema. Plans for redevelopment of the smaller Cambrian Centre were approved in 2012.

Building on hosting the Ryder Cup in 2010 and the NATO Summit in 2014, the 5,000 capacity Celtic Manor International Conference Centre (ICC Wales) opened its doors in 2019 as a conference venue for businesses and events in Wales and across the South West of England. It has hosted the UK Space Conference, BBC Cymru Wales broadcasts, and numerous national political conferences including hosting the Green Party of England and Wales and the UK Independence Party.

The 15-storey Chartist Tower is currently being redeveloped by developers Garrison Barclay Estates as a 163-bedroom Mercure Hotel, offering views across the city and the Bristol Channel. The site will also include 25,000 sq ft of office space and 18,000 sq ft of retail space. The hotel development is seen as an important step towards meeting the additional demand for hotel space in Newport created by the International Convention Centre (ICC) Wales. The opening of the hotel was delayed by several months due to Wales&#x27; lockdown as a response to COVID-19 and opened in May 2022.

Newport Market has also being redeveloped as a £12m mixed use site with a tech hub, apartments, market units, as well as a food court, a project led by Newport City Council and the proprietors of Tramshed Cardiff.

==Transport==

:&quot;See also :Category:Transport in Newport, Wales&quot;

For those travelling west from England into Wales, Newport is the first major urban area one passes through. As a result, it is a convergence point for national road, bus, and rail routes.

===Aviation===

The nearest airport with scheduled domestic and international flights is Cardiff Airport, south-west of Newport. The airport is a 35-minute drive away from the city or a 55-minute train journey which involves changing at Cardiff Central for Vale of Glamorgan Line services to the nearby Rhoose Cardiff International Airport railway station. The airport is also accessible by transferring to 24-hour TrawsCymru T9 buses, which begin at Cardiff Central station.

In 2003, a proposal for a new &quot;Severnside&quot; airport near Newport was rejected by the Department for Transport. The airport would have featured runways on a man-made island in the Severn Estuary.

===Buses===


Newport bus station is the largest bus interchange in the county, with 24 stands. It was built as part of the adjacent Friars Walk shopping centre and the station opened in December 2015.

Bus services are primarily provided by the municipally funded Newport Bus company, and neighbouring firm Cardiff Bus. Other operators include Phil Anslow Coaches, Stagecoach in South Wales, New Adventure Travel (N.A.T.), and until recently, First West of England.

Inter-city National Express services run from a stop near the Riverfront arts centre, opposite the bus station and Megabus (Europe) services operate outside of Newport station.

=== Railway ===

Newport is the easternmost Welsh city on the United Kingdom rail network and has close proximity to major economic centres in Cardiff and Bristol. Newport railway station is the second-busiest station in Wales and, due to its interchange options, it serves as a major transfer station.

The Great Western Main Line connects the city with termini at Bristol Temple Meads, London Paddington and Pembroke Dock; the Welsh Marches line connects with Holyhead, Manchester Piccadilly and Llanelli; and the Gloucester line connects the borders region including Cheltenham. The Wessex Main Line also provides an hourly service from the city to Portsmouth. The station has four platforms and is a mandatory stop on all express services to and from London Paddington.

The city is well linked with the nearby Welsh capital Cardiff, with approximately six rail and five bus services between the cities every hour. Services to/from Bristol stop at Newport on average 2–3 times per hour, while there are nearly 4 services to/from London each hour.

==== Modernisation ====
The current Newport station was built in 2010, in a hypermodern green ETFE structure, after a £22 million refurbishment programme; it introduced the futuristic new passenger terminal and bridge, whilst restoring the 19th-century features of the site. The new complex, west of the old station entrance, includes two terminals, four full-size platforms, new terminal buildings and a public footbridge, a new passenger footbridge, a new taxi area, short-stay car park and a 250-space passenger car park.

The 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line programme has seen the installation of new facilities on platforms 2 and 3, including redesigned toilets, waiting rooms and covered areas.

Overhead line equipment has been installed through the city, as part of electrification of the London to Cardiff line, which allows the operation of Japanese-built Intercity Express Programme 10-car trains. The new services are all-electric, with more seats and improvements to journey times between Newport and London of around 1 hour 30 minutes, including non-stop services after Wales between Bristol Parkway and London Paddington.

Rogerstone railway station, on the Ebbw Valley (Western Valleys) line, reopened in 2008 and Pye Corner, close to the site of the former Bassaleg railway station, opened around 2015. Transport for Wales services run between Ebbw Vale and Cardiff Central, and between Ebbw Vale and Newport, via Rogerstone and Pye Corner. Direct services between Ebbw Vale and Newport were reintroduced in early 2024 following work on local signalling.

There are active proposals from Grand Central to operate services from Llanelli, via Cardiff and Newport, to London Paddington, only stopping at Severn Tunnel Junction and Bristol Parkway instead of the current service which also calls at Didcot Parkway, Swindon and Reading.

Set in a park of , Tredegar House is an example of a 17th-century Charles II mansion. The earliest surviving part of the building dates back to the late 15th century. For over five hundred years, it was home to the Morgans – later Lords Tredegar – until they left in 1951. The house was then bought by the Catholic Church and used as a girls&#x27; school until it was bought by the council in 1974, which led to it being described as the &quot;grandest council house in Britain&quot;.

Newport hosted the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1897, 1988 and 2004.

A mosaic Chartist Mural was created in 1978 near John Frost Square to commemorate the Chartist rising of 1839. It was demolished amid protests in October 2013 to make way for city centre redevelopment. A trust was set up to commission a new memorial with £50,000 of funding provided by Newport City Council In 2014 the Newport Chartist Commission, with members Dame Rosemary Butler, Pat Drewett and Rowan Williams, sought to recruit a project manager.

A smaller replica of the mural, in four panels, was unveiled on 4 November 2019, exactly 180 years since the Chartist uprising. It was created by Oliver Budd, son of the original mural&#x27;s creator, Kenneth Budd. The panels are located on Cefn Road, Rogerstone, and include an information board telling the history of Chartism.

To the south of the city lies the extensive Caldicot and Wentloog Levels and Newport Wetlands Reserve. The Wetlands reserve opened in March 2000 as a mitigation for the loss of mudflats caused by the building of the Cardiff Bay Barrage. A Local Nature Reserve is established at Allt-yr-yn.

Newport City footbridge is a cycle and pedestrian bridge in Newport city centre linking the east and west banks of the River Usk.

A cycle and pedestrian walkway on the west bank of the River Usk links Newport city centre at Crindau to central Caerleon. There is a marked heritage trail in Caerleon. A cycle and pedestrian walkway is on both banks of the River Usk. The East bank path links Newport Bridge to Lliswerry. The West bank path links Newport Bridge to Newport Transporter Bridge and to Lliswerry via Newport City Bridge. It is therefore possible to walk or cycle from the north to the south of the City whilst largely avoiding public roads.

The Celtic Trail cycle route and National Cycle Route 4 passes through Newport.

The main municipal leisure sports facilities are based at Newport Centre in the city centre, Newport International Sports Village at Lliswerry and the Newport Active Living Centre at Bettws. There is a purpose-built indoor bowls arena at the Glebelands.

The city has a thriving Scout District.

===Boxing===
The boxer David Pearce was born in Newport.

===Rugby===
Newport RFC was established in 1874 and was one of the founder members of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1881. Newport was the only side to beat the (otherwise) Invincible All Blacks of 1963–64 and has also beaten the other two major Southern Hemisphere sides, Australia and South Africa, in its history.

Since the introduction of regional rugby franchises in Wales in 2003, Newport RFC now play in the Welsh Premier Division and operate as a feeder club to the Dragons regional team, who play in the United Rugby Championship. While the Dragons play at Rodney Parade near Newport city centre, Newport RFC play the majority of their home games at Newport Stadium in the Spytty area of the city.

Nine other rugby union teams playing in the Welsh League are based in Newport; Newport Saracens, Pill Harriers, Newport High School Old Boys, Bettws, Caerleon, Hartridge, Rogerstone, St Julians High School Old Boys and Whiteheads.

Newport had a rugby league club called the Newport Titans which played in the Welsh Conference Premier until it folded in 2012.

===Football===
Newport&#x27;s best known association football club is Newport County, who were formed in 1912 and joined the English Football League in 1920. Newport County have played in the second tier of English football and spent over 60 seasons in the Football League, reached the last 16 of the FA Cup, won the Welsh Cup in 1980 and subsequently reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1981. They were relegated from the Football League in 1988 and went bankrupt the following year. The club re-formed in 1989. They secured promotion back to the Football League for the 2013–14 season after a 25-year absence and now play in Football League Two.

Newport is also home to Cymru South (Welsh pyramid tier 2) side Newport City and Ardal South East league (tier 3) Lliswerry. A number of teams play in the Gwent County League tier 4: Caerleon, Newport Civil Service, Newport Corinthians, Pill and Rogerstone. Tier 5: Albion Rovers, Graig and Newport Saints. Tier 6: Riverside Rovers. The city has its own league, the Newport and District Football League, which is part of the Welsh football league system and consequently some Newport clubs field teams in the Gwent County League. Lovell&#x27;s Athletic were a fairly well known team in the mid-20th century – due to the suspension of League football during the Second World War they were the premier team in the city, as Newport County did not field a side. During this period they managed to reach the 3rd round of the FA Cup in the 1945–46 season.

Dragon Park (Welsh: &quot;Parc y Ddraig&quot;), the Football Association of Wales&#x27; National Football Centre, is located at the Newport International Sports Village. The centre also provides the headquarters for the Welsh Football Trust.

===Golf===
The city is home to the Celtic Manor Resort, a five-star conference resort and home of the Wales Open, the annual European Tour golf tournament. The resort was the venue for the All*Star Cup celebrity golf tournament in 2005 and for the 2010 Ryder Cup.

The city has high-quality golf facilities at Llanwern Golf Club, Peterstone Golf Club, Parc Golf Academy in Coedkernew and Newport Golf Club and Tredegar Park Golf Club in Rogerstone. Caerleon has a good quality nine-hole municipal course, driving range and clubhouse.

Within a short drive of Newport are golf clubs at St Mellons, Dewstow, Shirenewton, St Pierre, GreenMeadow, Woodlake, Alice Springs, Pontypool and Raglan.

===Cycling===
The Newport International Sports Village at Lliswerry includes the Wales National Velodrome, the head office of Welsh Cycling.

==Twinning==
Newport is twinned with:
* Heidenheim, Germany (since 1980)
* Kutaisi, Georgia (since 1989)
=== Former relations ===
* Guangxi Province, China, from 1996 to 2019 (defunct)

Newport City Council voted unanimously on 23 July 2019 to effectively end relations with the Guangxi Province region of China.

38,000 people had petitioned the council to end its twinning agreement due to the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, which takes place in the Guangxi town of Yulin each year. Council Leader Debbie Wilcox, Baroness Wilcox stated that while the council had previously written a strong letter to officials from Guangxi, this had been ignored, and that cutting ties was now necessary. The Council says it will now lobby the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Great Britain–China Centre on the issue of protecting dogs.

<text>Christa Wolf (; Ihlenfeld; 18 March 1929 – 1 December 2011) was a German novelist and essayist. She is considered one of the most important writers to emerge from the former East Germany.

==Biography==

Wolf was born the daughter of Otto and Herta Ihlenfeld, in Landsberg an der Warthe, then in the Province of Brandenburg. (The city is now Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland.) After World War II, her family, being Germans, were expelled from their home on what had become Polish territory. They crossed the new Oder-Neisse border in 1945 and settled in Mecklenburg, in what would become the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany.

She studied literature at the University of Jena and the University of Leipzig. After her graduation, she worked for the German Writers&#x27; Union and became an editor for a publishing company. While working as an editor for publishing companies Verlag Neues Leben and Mitteldeutscher Verlag and as a literary critic for the journal &quot;Neue deutsche Literatur&quot;, Wolf was provided contact with antifascists and Communists, many of whom had either returned from exile or from imprisonment in concentration camps. Her writings discuss political, economic, and scientific power, making her an influential spokesperson in East and West Germany during post-World War II for the empowerment of individuals to be active within the industrialized and patriarchal society.

She joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1949 and left it in June 1989, six months before the Communist regime collapsed. She was a candidate member of the Central Committee of the SED from 1963 to 1967. Stasi records found in 1993 showed that she worked as an informant (&quot;Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter&quot;) during the years 1959–61.

Stasi officers criticized what they called her &quot;reticence&quot;, and they lost interest in her cooperation. She was herself then closely monitored for nearly 30 years. During the Cold War, Wolf was openly critical of the leadership of the GDR, but she maintained a loyalty to the values of socialism and opposed German reunification. Her experience of being under Stasi surveliance was reflected in her novella &quot;Was bleibt&quot; (&quot;What Remains&quot;).

In 1961, she published &quot;Moskauer Novelle&quot; (&quot;Moscow Novella&quot;). Wolf&#x27;s breakthrough as a writer came in 1963 with the publication of &quot;Der geteilte Himmel&quot; (&quot;Divided Heaven&quot; or &quot;They Divided the Sky&quot;). Her subsequent works included &quot;Nachdenken über Christa T.&quot; (&quot;The Quest for Christa T.&quot;, 1968), &quot;Kindheitsmuster&quot; (&quot;Patterns of Childhood&quot;, 1976), &quot;Kein Ort. Nirgends&quot; (&quot;No Place on Earth&quot;, 1979), &quot;Kassandra&quot; (&quot;Cassandra&quot;, 1983), &quot;Störfall&quot; (&quot;Accident&quot;, 1987), &quot;Auf dem Weg nach Tabou&quot; (&quot;On the Way to Taboo&quot;, 1994), &quot;Medea&quot; (1996), and &quot;Stadt der Engel oder The Overcoat of Dr. Freud&quot; (&quot;City of Angels or The Overcoat of Dr. Freud&quot;, 2010).

&quot;Christa T.&quot; was a work that — while briefly touching on a disconnection from one&#x27;s family&#x27;s ancestral home – was primarily concerned with the experiences of a woman feeling overwhelming societal pressure to conform. Kate Webb in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the novel Wolf&#x27;s &quot;most important work&quot; and wrote that it became a &quot;feminist classic&quot;.

&quot;Kassandra&quot; is perhaps Wolf&#x27;s most important book, reinterpreting the Battle of Troy as a war for economic power and a shift from a matriarchal to a patriarchal society. The novella &quot;Was bleibt&quot;, which described her life under Stasi surveillance, was written in 1979, but not published until 1990. &quot;Auf dem Weg nach Tabou&quot; gathered essays, speeches, and letters written during the four years following the reunification of Germany. &quot;Leibhaftig&quot; (2002) describes a woman struggling with life and death in 1980s East-German hospital, while awaiting medicine from the West. Central themes in her work are German fascism, humanity, feminism, and self-discovery. In many of her works, Wolf uses illness as a metaphor. In a speech addressed to the &quot;Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft&quot; (German Cancer Society) she says, &quot;How we choose to speak or not to speak about illnesses such as cancer mirrors our misgivings about society.&quot; In &quot;Nachdenken über Christa T.&quot;, the protagonist dies of leukemia. This work demonstrates the dangers and consequences that happen to an individual when they internalize society&#x27;s contradictions.

In &quot;Accident&quot;, the narrator&#x27;s brother is undergoing surgery to remove a brain tumor a few days after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster had occurred.

In 2004, she edited and published her correspondence with her UK-based near namesake Charlotte Wolff over the years 1983–1986 (Wolf, Christa and Wolff, Charlotte (2004) &quot;Ja, unsere Kreise berühren sich: Briefe&quot;, Luchterhand Munich).

Wolf died 1 December 2011, aged 82, in Berlin, where she had lived with her husband, . She was buried on 13 December 2011 in Berlin&#x27;s Dorotheenstadt cemetery. In 2018, the city of Berlin designated her grave as an &quot;Ehrengrab&quot;.

==Reception==
Although Wolf&#x27;s works were widely praised in both Germanys in the 1970s and 1980s, they have sometimes been seen as controversial since German reunification. Nicholas Shakespeare (novelist and biographer) wrote that in East Germany &quot;writers such as Christa Wolf became irrelevant overnight once the Berlin Wall was broached&quot;.

Upon publication of &quot;Was bleibt&quot;, West German critics such as Frank Schirrmacher argued that Wolf failed to criticize the authoritarianism of the East German Communist regime, whilst others called her works &quot;moralistic&quot;. Defenders have recognized Wolf&#x27;s role in establishing a distinctly East German literary voice.

Fausto Cercignani&#x27;s study of Wolf&#x27;s earlier novels and essays on her later works have helped promote awareness of her narrative gifts, irrespective of her political and personal ups and downs. The emphasis placed by Cercignani on heroism of women in Christa Wolf&#x27;s works 
has opened the way to subsequent studies in this direction.

Wolf received the Heinrich Mann Prize in 1963, the Georg Büchner Prize in 1980, and the Schiller Memorial Prize in 1983, the Geschwister-Scholl-Preis in 1987, as well as other national and international awards. After the German reunification, Wolf received further awards: in 1999 she was awarded the Elisabeth Langgässer Prize and the Nelly Sachs Literature Prize. Wolf became the first recipient of the Deutscher Bücherpreis (German Book Prize) in 2002 for her lifetime achievement. In 2010, Wolf was awarded the Großer Literaturpreis der Bayerischen Akademie der Schönen Künste.

<doc id="338058" wikidata="Q452309" url="?curid=338058" title="Werner Seelenbinder">
<text>Werner Seelenbinder (2 August 1904 – 24 October 1944) was a German communist and wrestler.

== Early years ==
Seelenbinder was born in Stettin, Pomerania (modern-day Poland), and became a wrestler after training as a joiner. He had connections with the young people&#x27;s workers&#x27; movement from an early age. Seelenbinder won the light heavyweight class of Greco-Roman wrestling at the 1925 Workers&#x27; Olympiad in Frankfurt. In 1928 and 1929 he won the Spartakiad in Moscow; over 200 German sportsmen were banned from the contest, but Seelenbinder, with his interest in Marxism, took part. His first trip to Moscow had already persuaded him to become a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1933 he refused to give the Nazi salute when receiving his medal at the German Wrestling Championship, and was punished with a sixteen-month ban on training and sports events.
German workers&#x27; sports clubs were soon banned by the Nazi party; at this point the KPD approached Seelenbinder, asking him to join one of the legal sports clubs, to train to get as much sporting success as possible, so he would be able to carry messages across Germany and into other countries. As one of the country&#x27;s top sportsmen he had more freedom of movement and could travel abroad. As well as preparing for the Olympics, Seelenbinder joined the Uhrig Group, an underground resistance group named after Robert Uhrig, who organized it.

== 1936 Olympics and arrest ==
As a committed communist Seelenbinder was appalled by the 1936 Olympic Games that were to be held in Nazi Germany. He had originally planned to boycott it, but friends persuaded him to compete anyway, win, and defy the Nazis by not giving the required Nazi salute, but to use a vulgar gesture instead. This plan was foiled when he lost the first match. He eventually came in fourth in the event.

The Nazis had only allowed Seelenbinder to take part in the Olympics because they thought he would secure them a medal: otherwise, they did not trust him in the slightest. Seelenbinder&#x27;s illegal activities as a courier and his participation in the Uhrig Group had caught their attention: he was arrested, along with 65 other members of the group, on 4 February 1942 and after being tortured for eight days, and enduring nine camps and prisons for two and half years, he was sentenced to death by the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot;, he was executed for treason on 24 October 1944 at Brandenburg-Görden Prison – he was beheaded with an axe. The imprisonment left him weighing a mere 60 kilograms (132 pounds), from his previous weight of 90 kilos (198 pounds).

In his farewell letter, he wrote to his father:The time has now come for me to say goodbye. In the time of my imprisonment I must have gone through every type of torture a man can possibly endure. Ill health and physical and mental agony, I have been spared nothing. I would have liked to have experienced the delights and comforts of life, which I now appreciate twice as much, with you all, with my friends and fellow sportsmen, after the war. The times I had with you were great, and I lived on them during my incarceration, and wished back that wonderful time. Sadly fate has now decided differently, after a long time of suffering. But I know that I have found a place in all your hearts and in the hearts of many sports followers, a place where I will always hold my ground. This knowledge makes me proud and strong and will not let me be weak in my last moments.

== Memorials and controversy ==
On 29 July 1945 an urn containing Seelenbinder&#x27;s ashes was buried at the site of his old club, the Berolina 03 Sports Club stadium in Neukölln, Berlin. At the same time, the stadium itself was named &quot;Werner-Seelenbinder-Kampfbahn&quot;, but as the Cold War escalated and the political climate in West Germany became increasingly anti-communist, it was renamed &quot;Stadion Neukölln&quot; in 1949. A number of schools, streets and sporting facilities in the former East Germany were named after him. The Werner Seelenbinder Wrestling Tournament is still (2004) held once a year in Berlin. However, the lack of impartiality by both the anti-communist West Germans and the pro-communist East Germans, who raised Werner Seelenbinder to the status of an icon, means that today his historical importance is rather controversial. In an article in the socialist German newspaper &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot; of 2 August 2004, the director of the Berlin Sports Museum Martina Behrendt said that his role in the resistance movement had been exaggerated in the GDR, and that there were no reliable biographies.
On 2 August 2004 a commemorative speech was held in front of the Neukölln stadium, where Seelenbinder&#x27;s ashes were buried, by the Party of Democratic Socialism, on the 100th anniversary of Seelenbinder&#x27;s birth. Party members spoke of their regret that the stadium had been renamed. Others mentioned with sadness the renaming of the eastern German &quot;Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle&quot; as &quot;Velodrom im Europasportpark&quot; in 1990 and the renaming of the &quot;Werner-Seelenbinder-Turm&quot; in Leipzig as the &quot;Glockenturm&quot;. On 24 October 2004, the 60th anniversary of Seelenbinder&#x27;s death, the Neukölln stadium was once again renamed the &quot;Werner-Seelenbinder-Stadion&quot; in his memory.

In 1950, an indoor sporting arena named after Seelenbinder, the Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle, was opened in the Prenzlauer Berg district, then in East Berlin. It had a capacity of 10,000 people, and was regularly used as a convention hall by East German mass organizations, such as the Free German Youth and Socialist Unity Party of Germany. It was also used as a concert arena, where musicians such as Depeche Mode, Jonathan Richman and The Wedding Present, as well as German acts, such as Feeling B and Rio Reiser, performed. It was demolished in 1993, after the fall of East Germany, and replaced by the present-day Velodrom.

In 1964, the Nordic Yards Warnemünde ship yard (the former Warnowwerft), launched a 7,704 gross tonnage cargo ship named &quot;Werner Seelenbinder&quot;. She was scrapped in 1988 – before the collapse of the GDR. She remained named after the athlete throughout her career, apart from her final voyage to Alang for breaking up, for which she was re-registered and renamed &quot;MILOS-1&quot;.

Seelenbinder was inducted to Germany&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.

<text>Council-controlled organisations (CCOs) and council-controlled trading organisations in New Zealand are what were formerly known as &quot;local-authority trading enterprises&quot; (&quot;LATEs&quot;). Introduced under Sections 6 and 7 of the &quot;Local Government Act 2002&quot;, they are essentially any company with a majority council shareholding, or a trust or similar organisation with a majority of council-controlled votes or council-appointed trustees, &quot;unless&quot; designated otherwise. More than one council may be represented in a council-controlled organisation.

They are used for widely varying purposes by councils. For example, the Wellington City Council uses trusts to hold museums and its zoo, while in 1996 the Horowhenua District Council transferred its library functions to the Horowhenua Library Trust.

In the past, the erstwhile for-profit LATEs were seen as the local government equivalent of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Many of these, which included bus companies, diagnostic laboratories, public works divisions and property investment companies, were privatised. For-profit council organisations are now termed &quot;council-controlled trading organisations&quot; under the Act. Council-controlled organisations pay tax to central government, unlike the internal activities of councils which are tax-free.

The &quot;Local Government Act&quot; exempts certain organisations from its legislative control and there is a mechanism under Section 7 to manually designate further exceptions. The automatic exceptions include:

*electricity companies and electricity trusts
*energy companies
*port companies and their subsidiaries
*Infrastructure Auckland and its subsidiaries
*New Zealand Local Government Association and its subsidiaries
*New Zealand Local Government Insurance Corporation
*Watercare Services (Auckland)

<doc id="338060" wikidata="Q747313" url="?curid=338060" title="BGM-71 TOW">
<text>The BGM-71 TOW (&quot;Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided&quot;, pronounced ) is an American anti-tank missile. TOW replaced much smaller missiles like the SS.10 and ENTAC, offering roughly twice the effective range, a more powerful warhead, and a greatly improved semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) that could also be equipped with infrared cameras for night time use.

First produced in 1968, TOW is one of the most widely used anti-tank guided missiles. It can be found in a wide variety of manually carried and vehicle-mounted forms, as well as widespread use on helicopters. Originally designed by Hughes Aircraft in the 1960s, the weapon is currently produced by RTX.

==History==
===Previous designs===
Late in World War II, the German Army began experimenting with modified versions of the Ruhrstahl X-4 wire-guided missile. Originally developed for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as an anti-bomber weapon, by changing the warhead to one using a high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) design, the new X-7 version made an effective anti-armor weapon with a range of hundreds of meters. This would greatly improve the effectiveness of infantry anti-tank operations, which at that time were generally based on smaller weapons like the Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck, limited in the best case to ranges on the order of . X-7 was never fully developed before the war ended.

In the immediate post-war era, the design was picked up by development teams in France and Australia. In France, Nord Aviation&#x27;s Jean Bastien-Thiry developed an updated version of the X-7 using a solid fuel rocket as the very small and highly portable SS.10. Development started in 1948, with the first rounds fired in 1952. Evaluations by the US Army in 1953 concluded it was not ready for operation, but that its progress should be tracked. The Army then instructed the Redstone Arsenal to develop its own version of the basic concept, which emerged as the SSM-A-23 Dart, a larger design with roughly twice the range of the SS.10. While the development of the Dart continued, Nord delivered a workable version of the SS.10, as well as the extended-range SS.11. In the summer of 1958, the development of the Dart was canceled in favor of purchasing the two French designs.

During the same period, the British Army had been developing its heavyweight long-range weapon with Australia, the Malkara, with a range of about . The tracking system, similar to the SS.11, proved difficult to use and a new project started under the codename Orange William. This system used a computer to calculate the impact point, sending commands to the missile using an infrared link. But the link was found not to work in smoke or dust, making it largely useless on the battlefield. A new design emerged, combining the guidance system of the small Vickers Vigilant with a new and highly maneuverable missile to produce Swingfire. The goal was to allow the launcher to remain completely undercover while a gunner took a portable sight forward to aim at the targets from a concealed location.

===New concept===
In the fall of 1958, the Army&#x27;s Office of Ordnance Research and Development formed the Ad Hoc Working Group at the Ballistic Research Laboratories (BRL) to define a future replacement for the SS.10 and 11. The team included members from Picatinny Arsenal, Frankford Arsenal, Redstone Arsenal, Watervliet Arsenal, Detroit Arsenal and Harry Diamond Laboratories. The group almost immediately decided not to attempt to define a weapon concept, and instead spend the next two years studying the problem while researching the possibility of using alternative guidance systems and continually watching foreign developments where the US was lagging.

It was at some point during this early development that the British became aware of the US developments. Having approved Swingfire to some degree based on the possibility of foreign sales, the emergence of a possible US competitor was a concern. Meetings between Solly Zuckerman and John H. Rubel led to the July 1961 Rubel-Zuckerman agreement, wherein the UK would continue development of the long-range Swingfire while the US concentrated on shorter-range missiles, up to , with new guidance systems. The US agreed to not introduce a system that competed directly with Swingfire or Vigilant without prior consultation but was free to develop new unguided &quot;assault weapons&quot; to replace the LAW. Both the US and Canadian Army agreed to purchase Swingfire for the long-range role.

===HAW===
Despite the efforts to reach an agreement over anti-tank missiles, in the early summer of 1961, the Chief of Ordnance asked BRL to deliver a formal definition for what was then known as the &quot;Heavy Assault Weapon for the Long Range period&quot;, or HAW for short. They asked for a weapon to be delivered sometime between 1965 and 1970. BRL assigned the work to the Armored Systems Evaluation Branch of the Weapon Systems Laboratory. David Hardison, the Branch Chief, reconvened the Ad Hoc panel to review a long list of twenty-seven design proposals, all of which were found lacking.

Hardison then began preparing a list of the ideal characteristics of a HAW weapon. Of primary importance was the adoption of some form of semi-automatic guidance, as the manual guidance systems (MCLOS) of earlier weapons like SS.11 were found to be difficult to use as the relative movements of the launcher and target increased; MCLOS worked well for stationary launchers and slow-moving targets but had proven much more difficult to use from moving vehicles, and especially helicopters.

Experience with the MGM-51 Shillelagh missile demonstrated that the simplest solution to successfully tracking the missile was to optically track a flare attached to the missile using an infrared seeker. This was essentially identical to a heat seeking missile, but tracking its own missile rather than a separate target. Flares, however, were not ideal illumination sources, especially in the case where multiple rounds might be fired and the optical system might track the wrong one. In place of the flare, the panel selected an infrared (IR) lamp whose output would be modulated with a shutter so each missile would have a unique signal.

Using this style of guidance demanded that the missile be brought into the line-of-sight of the tracking system as soon as possible; in Shillelagh this was almost immediate because the missile was launched from a gun barrel directly into the view of the tracker. Earlier manual weapons like SS.10 and ENTAC flew upwards after launch to clear the ground when being launched by infantry lying on the ground, and thus would not be immediately visible along the line-of-sight. To ensure the HAW could be tracked successfully, it would have to be launched from a tube, like Shillelagh, but one that was lightweight to ensure mobility.

Finally, Shillelagh sent guidance commands to the missile using an infrared link, but as the British had discovered, this proved relatively unreliable in the field and was subject to countermeasures like random flashing IR lamps. For the shorter ranges envisioned for HAW, wire guidance was perfectly suitable and both much less expensive and largely immune to countermeasures.

===TOW emerges===
The resulting design was tube-launched, optically tracked, and wire-guided. BRL programmer Harry Reed immediately christened it &quot;TOW&quot;, a name that the system carried into production.

One problem that was noted early on was that the tube launch would make it difficult for the missile to be launched from a helicopter unless it was pointed relatively directly toward the target. Earlier systems were manually guided and did not need to be &quot;gathered&quot; quickly, so these were easier to launch at high crossing angles. Seeing this might be a major problem in the short term, TOW simply dropped the helicopter-launch requirement.

When the BRL team returned the HAW/TOW study, the Pentagon gave them six months to come up with an actual requirement instead of a list of desirable features. Reed gathered submissions from the industry and quickly selected three contractors for further details, Hughes Aircraft, Martin Marietta, and McDonnell Douglas. All three companies concluded the concept was able to be produced.

On 12 January 1962, the BRL officially assigned the development of the TOW concept to the U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM), who in turn formed the Antitank/Aircraft Weapons Commodity Office on 19 November 1962. In December 1962, Hughes was instructed to continue development while a development contract was being drawn up. Budget approval for development was granted in January 1963 as the XM65 TOW, and the final development contract, the first 100 percent cost-plus-incentive-fee, was signed on 3 May 1963. This led to the TOW Project Office opening on 1 October 1964.

The British learned of the TOW program when it was sent to MICOM. In May, the US suggested they abandon Swingfire in favor of TOW, pointing out that the French were also introducing a long-range missile, and with three similar weapons in the marketplace, the British would find foreign sales difficult. However, the British Army was convinced that the launch vehicle would only survive if it was completely undercover, and TOW required the launcher to remain in sight of the target through the entire flight of the missile. They continued the development of Swingfire.

In 1969, the House Authorization Subcommittee considered ending the TOW program in favor of the Shillelagh. A series of presentations by both missile teams followed, and ultimately the decision was made to continue both programs in September 1970.

===Designs===
Three designs were returned for the initial selection, from Hughes, McDonnell, and Martin. Hughes&#x27; design used pop-out fins and a gyroscope to allow it to automatically maintain an &quot;up&quot; direction. The wire spools were licensed from Bofors and the rocket motor was made by Hercules. Guidance would be via flare tracking, using an internally-designed IR sensor based on their AIM-4 Falcon efforts.

McDonnell&#x27;s entry did not attempt to control the spin of the missile, deliberately allowing it to spin during launch and flight like an artillery shell to improve accuracy. Like the Hughes entry, a gyroscope was used to define the up direction; in this case, this constantly changed relative to the missile body as it spun. The IR detector was placed at the end of a vertical V-shaped channel in the launcher. As gravity pulled the missile downward, it would begin to be blocked by the lower side of the V, causing the system to send commands to pull the missile upward. When it reached the top of the view at the end of the V, it stopped the up commands. The result was that the missile bounced up and down every of flight.

Finally, Martin&#x27;s missile used two side-mounted swept-back wings and a rocket that was split into two outlet tubes that were angled downward to give the missile natural lift during flight.

=== Hughes wins===
The initial production contract was awarded to Hughes on 28 June 1968, and the final contract on 29 November 1968. On 10 June 1969, Chrysler&#x27;s Huntsville Division was awarded the second-source contract.

Many problems emerged with the initial design, notably the early versions of the rocket motors which sometimes ejected burning bits of fuel, presenting a hazard to the gunners. MICOM suggested a new motor using &quot;head end suspended double base&quot; fuel from the M72 LAW which solved this problem. The IR source had problems due to its use of a fine metal filament that ignited the arc lamp which often broke during firing. Repeated tests and modifications solved this. The launch tube was designed to be sealed at both ends, with the rear seal being blown off by the rocket motor and the front by pressurized gas released by the guidance system&#x27;s gyroscope. In practice, both proved unreliable, but remedial action solved the problems.

Production began at USAF Plant #44 and the first production examples were delivered in August 1969. In September 1970 three training battalions had formed, and by 30 September 1970, the TOW had replaced the Army&#x27;s existing heavy anti-tank weapon, the M40 recoilless rifle. It increasingly replaced the French ENTAC missiles purchased earlier.

===Helicopter launch===
In December 1963 the issue of helicopter launches was once again considered. The problem with the existing semi-automatic systems was that the missile had to be &quot;gathered&quot; by the optical tracker quickly for it to send commands to the missile. In contrast, earlier all-manual systems could be guided by the gunner at any time. With the TOW being launched from a tube, some other system would be needed to ensure it could be guided into the optics field of view after launch. This would be all the more difficult if the helicopter was not flying directly at the target, or was maneuvering.

MICOM sent contracts to both Hughes and Philco Ford, makers of the Shillelagh, to develop stabilized launch sights for their respective missile designs. They were in the form of a complete system combining the sighting system, launcher tube assembly, and all related equipment as the XM26 weapon system. Hughes won the contest in 1965 and was awarded a second development contract for XM26 in June 1966.

XM26 was initially developed by a separate organization within BRL, the Aircraft Weapons Commodity Office. This was assigned to the TOW Project Office on 5 April 1970.

===Replacement===
The U.S. Army is seeking a replacement for the TOW through the Close Combat Missile System-Heavy (CCMS-H) effort. Objectives are for a weapon with increased range out to or more, as well as greater speed, the ability to fire on the move, and lock on before and after launch capability while retaining similar launcher size and arming distance. The Army hopes to field the CCMS-H sometime between 2028 and 2032.

==Design==
In 1997, Raytheon purchased the missile systems division of Hughes Electronics from General Motors Corporation, so the development and production of TOW systems now come under the Raytheon brand. The weapon is used in anti-armor, anti-bunker, anti-fortification and anti-amphibious landing roles. TOW is in service with over 45 militaries and is integrated on over 15,000 ground, vehicle and helicopter platforms worldwide.

In its basic infantry form, the system breaks down into some modules: a folding tripod mount, a launch tube (into the rear of which encased missiles are inserted), a mandatory daylight tracker unit, which can be augmented with an optional AN/TAS-4 or AN/TAS-4/A gas-cooled night sight (or an all-in-one tracker unit on the M41 ITAS version), and a traversing unit, which mounts onto the tripod and carries the launch tube and sight, that also includes the weapon&#x27;s trigger and the bridging clamp, which mates with the missile&#x27;s umbilical data connector. In addition to this main assembly, there is a separate fire control system (FCS) module, which performs all guidance calculations, and a battery pack to power the system. These two modules link to each other, with the FCS then linked to the daylight tracker by a cable.
When the target is sighted and the trigger is pulled, there is a 1.5-second firing delay while the missile spins up its internal gyroscope and the thermal battery reaches operating temperature. Once this concludes, the launch motor fires through the rear nozzle propelling the missile from the tube: this soft-launch motor fires for only 0.05 seconds and burns out before the missile has exited the tube. As the missile exits the launch tube, the first four wings just forward of the flight motor spring open forward, followed by four tail control surfaces, which flip open rearwards as the missile completely exits the launch tube. As the wings fully extend at about 7 meters from the launcher, the flight motor ignites, boosting the missile&#x27;s speed to approximately 600 miles per hour (~1,000 kilometers per hour) during its burn time. At 0.18 seconds after launch, around 65 meters from the launcher, the warhead is armed by G-forces from acceleration by the flight motor, a safety feature intended to protect the operator if the flight motor fails to ignite. The flight motor burns out 1.6 seconds after launch, with the missile gliding for the remainder of its flight time. After the tracker captures the missile, IR sensors bore-sighted to the daylight tracker continuously monitor the position of an IR beacon on the missile&#x27;s tail relative to the line-of-sight, with the FCS generating course corrections which are sent via the command link to the missile&#x27;s integral flight control unit. The missile then corrects its flight path via the control surface actuators. The operator keeps the sight&#x27;s crosshair centered over the target until impact: if the missile fails to strike a target, the command wires are automatically cut at 3,000 meters on the original TOW and 3,750 meters on most current-production TOWs. An automatic wire cut also occurs if the tracker fails to detect the missile&#x27;s thermal beacon within 1.85 seconds of launching.

The TOW missile was continually upgraded, with an improved TOW missile (ITOW) appearing in 1978 that had a new warhead triggered by a long probe, which was extended after launch, that gave a stand-off distance of for improved armor penetration. The 1983 TOW 2 featured a larger warhead with a extensible probe, improved resistance to jamming with a second, shorter wavelength xenon tracking beacon and optical encoders to randomly modulate the pulse frequency of both beacons and a motor that provided around 30% more thrust. This was followed by the TOW 2A/B, which appeared in 1987.

Hughes developed a TOW missile with a wireless data link in 1989, referred to as TOW-2N, but this weapon was not adopted for use by the U.S. military. Raytheon continued to develop improvements to the TOW line, but its FOTT (Follow-On To TOW) program was canceled in 1998, and its TOW-FF (TOW-Fire and Forget) program was cut short in 2002 because of funding limitations. In 2001 and 2002, Raytheon and the U.S. Army worked together on an extended range TOW-2B variant, initially referred to as TOW-2B (ER), but now called TOW-2B Aero, which has a special nose cap that increases range to 4.5 km. TOW-2B has top attack capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlHughes / Raytheon BGM-71 TOW / TOW-2 Heavy Anti-Tank (AT) Weapon System – United States&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although this missile has been in production since 2004, no U.S. Army designation has yet been assigned. Wireless versions of the TOW-2A, TOW-2B, and TOW-2B Aero have been developed that use a &quot;stealthy&quot; one-way radio link, identified with the suffix &quot;RF&quot;. These missiles require no special alterations to the launcher since the RF transmitter is encased along with the missile and uses the standard umbilical data connector.

In 1999, TOW received the Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS).

The TOW missile in its current variations is not a fire-and-forget weapon and like most second-generation wire-guided missiles has Semi-Automatic Command Line of Sight guidance. This means that the guidance system is directly linked to the platform, and requires that the target be kept in the shooter&#x27;s line of sight until the missile impacts. A fire-and-forget TOW variant (TOW-FF) was under development but was canceled by the Army in 2002.

In October 2012, Raytheon received a contract to produce 6,676 TOW (wireless-guided) missiles for the U.S. military. Missiles that will be produced include the BGM-71E TOW 2A, the BGM-71F TOW 2B, the TOW 2B Aero, and the BGM-71H TOW Bunker Buster. By 2013, the U.S. Marine Corps had retired the air-launched TOW missile.

===Launch platforms===
TOW is designated as a BGM by the U.S. military: a multiple launch environment (B) surface attack (G) guided missile (M). The B launch environment prefix is used only when the system can be essentially unmodified when launched from a variety of launch platforms.

The M151 and M220 launchers are used by infantry, but can also be mounted on some vehicles, including the M151 jeep, the M113 APC, the M966 HMMWV and the M1045 HMMWV (which replaced the M966). These launchers are theoretically man-portable but are quite bulky. The updated M151 launcher was upgraded to include thermal optics to allow nighttime usage and had been simplified to reduce weight. The M220 was specifically developed to handle the TOW-2 series.

TOW systems have also been developed for vehicle-specific applications on the M2/M3 Bradley IFV/CFV, the LAV-AT, the M1134 Stryker ATGM carrier, and the now-retired M901 ITV (improved TOW vehicle); they are generally referred to as TOW under armor (TUA).

In helicopter applications, the M65 system used by the AH-1 series is the primary system deployed, but the XM26 system was developed for the UH-1, and a system was put into development for the later canceled AH-56 helicopter. TOW has also been used with AH.1 (TOW) and AH.7 variants of Westland Lynx helicopters, with the attachment of two pylons, each carrying four missiles.

The M41 TOW improved target acquisition system (ITAS) is a block upgrade to the M220 ground/high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV)-mounted TOW 2 missile system. The TOW ITAS is currently being fielded to airborne, air assault, and light infantry forces throughout the active and reserve components of the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps (where it is called the SABER). The ITAS, in addition to providing better anti-armor capabilities to antitank units, also has capabilities that make it an integral part of the combined arms team. Even when organized in heavy—light task forces, where the preponderance of antiarmor capabilities traditionally has resided in the heavy elements, TOW ITAS-equipped antitank units can not only destroy threat targets but also provide superior reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA), rear area protection, and urban operations capabilities.

The TOW ITAS consists of three new line replaceable units: the target acquisition subsystem (TAS), the fire control subsystem (FCS), and the lithium battery box (LBB); a modified TOW 2 traversing unit; the existing TOW launch tube and tripod; and a TOW Humvee modification kit. The TAS integrates into a single housing the direct view optics and missile tracker, a second-generation forward looking infrared (FLIR) night vision sight (NVS), and a laser rangefinder. TAS electronics provide automatic boresighting for these components, eliminating both tactical collimation and 180-day verification requirements. The integral cooling system for the IR optics is a modern SADA-II electrically powered cryocooler, removing the need to carry a supply of high-pressure coolant gas cartridges as was necessary for the previous AN/TAS-4 and AN/TAS-4A night sights.

The most recent addition to the ITAS system is the ITAS-FTL (far target location), which incorporates a new module called PADS (position attitude determination subsystem), a device that attaches to the top of the ITAS sighting unit and uses differential GPS tracking to relay precise coordinate data to the operator.

==Service history==
In 1968, a contract for full-scale production was awarded to Hughes, and by 1970 the system was being fielded by the U.S. Army. When adopted, the BGM-71 series replaced the M40 106 mm recoilless rifle and the MGM-32 ENTAC missile system then in service. The missile also replaced the AGM-22B then in service as a heliborne anti-tank weapon.

===1972: Vietnam: first combat use===

On 24 April 1972, the U.S. &quot;1st Combat Aerial TOW Team&quot; arrived in South Vietnam; the team&#x27;s mission was to test the new anti-armor missile under combat conditions. The team consisted of three crews, technical representatives from Bell Helicopter and Hughes Aircraft, members of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command, and two UH-1B helicopters; each mounting the XM26 TOW weapons system, which had been taken from storage. After displacing to the Central Highlands for aerial gunnery, the unit commenced daily searches for enemy armor. On 2 May 1972, U.S. Army UH-1 Huey helicopters firing TOWs destroyed North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) tanks near An Loc. This was heralded as the first time a U.S. unit neutralized enemy armor using American-designed and built guided missiles (in this case, against a captured American-made M41 operated by the PAVN). On 9 May, elements of the PAVN&#x27;s 203rd Armored Regiment assaulted Ben Het Camp held by Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Rangers. The Rangers destroyed the first three PT-76 amphibious light tanks of the 203rd, thereby breaking up the attack. During the battle for the city of Kontum, the TOW missile had proven to be a significant weapon in disrupting PAVN tank attacks within the region. By the end of May, BGM-71 TOW missiles had accumulated 24 confirmed kills of both PT-76 light and T-54 main battle tanks.

On 19 August, the ARVN 5th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division abandoned Firebase Ross in the Que Son Valley, southwest of Da Nang, to the PAVN 711th Division. A dozen TOW missiles were left with abandoned equipment and fell into PAVN hands.

===1982: Lebanon War===
The Israel Defense Forces used TOW missiles during the 1982 Lebanon War. On 11 June, Israeli anti-tank teams armed with TOW ambushed Syrian armored forces and destroyed many Syrian Soviet-made T-72 tanks. Estimates vary regarding the number of T-72s destroyed by TOWs (vs. the number destroyed by Merkava MBTs), with the lower end at nine and the high end attributing &quot;the majority&quot; of the 30 T-72s destroyed by Israeli forces in the war to Yossi Peled&#x27;s anti-tank TOW units. This was probably the first encounter of the American anti-tank missile with the newer Soviet tank.

===Iran–Iraq War===

In the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s, the Islamic Republic of Iran Army used TOW missiles purchased before the Iranian Revolution in 1979, as well as those purchased during the Iran–Contra affair.

Of the 202 AH-1J Internationals (export variant of the AH-1J SeaCobra) that Iran purchased from the US, 62 were TOW-capable. Iranian AH-1Js managed to slow down Iraqi tank advances into Iran. During the &quot;dogfights&quot; between Iranian SeaCobras and Iraqi Mil Mi-24s, Iranians achieved several &quot;kills&quot;, usually using TOW missiles.

===1991: Persian Gulf War===
TOW was used in multiple engagements during Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf War of 1991. During the war, both the M2 Bradley Infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) and the M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) carried TOW missiles. The M2 can also carry seven additional rounds, while the M3 can carry twelve. The M2 and M3 medium-weight Bradley Fighting Vehicles destroyed more Iraqi tanks during the war than the M1A1 Abrams heavy Main Battle Tanks.

Both AT (TOW) Company, 2nd Tank Battalion, 2nd Marine Division and AT (TOW) Company, 3rd Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division engaged Iraqi tanks with TOW missiles in their M1045/M1046 HMMWVs. These vehicles were configured with a roof-mounted TOW launcher and carried six rounds in the cargo compartment with an additional round in the tube.

The British Army also deployed TOW-armed, Westland Lynx helicopters to the conflict, where they were used to attack Iraqi armored vehicles. This was the first recorded use of the TOW missile from a British helicopter.

===1993: Somalia===
On 5 June, 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed by members of Mohamed Farrah Aidid&#x27;s Habr Gidr militia; some were skinned. Subsequently, the United Nations called for the arrest of those responsible. Weeks later they would formally place the blame on Aidid, leader of the Habr Gidr clan. Subsequently, U.N. troops hunted Aidid. Incidents between the two sides worsened, with fighting back and forth. On 12 July, three months before the Battle of Mogadishu, the United Nations and the United States attempted to defeat Aidid&#x27;s organization by attacking a strategy meeting of his native Habr Gidr clan under Operation Michigan. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the event as a &quot;slaughter&quot; in which a &quot;half-dozen&quot; AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters fired 16 TOW missiles and 2,000 rounds from their 20 mm cannons into the meeting of the elders and senior combat commanders. The first TOW missile destroyed the stairs, preventing escape. In the aftermath, it was revealed that Aidid was not in the meeting. The Red Cross claimed that 54 people had been killed, Admiral Jonathan T. Howe reported that 20 had died, while Aidid&#x27;s Somali National Alliance produced a list of 73 people who they claimed had been killed.

===2001: War in Afghanistan===
TOW missiles were used during the War in Afghanistan.

===2003: Iraq War===
Ten Humvee-mounted TOW missiles were used by U.S. forces in Iraq during the 22 July 2003 assault that killed Uday and Qusay Hussein. Although TOW missiles are generally used against armored vehicles, these missiles were used on the house where the two men were located.

===2011: Syrian Civil War===

The weapon was spotted as early as April 2014 in at least two videos that surfaced showing Syrian opposition forces in the Syrian civil war using BGM-71 TOWs, a weapon previously not seen in use by the opposition. Such a video, showing a BGM-71E-3B with the serial number removed, can be seen in a 27 May 2014 episode of the PBS series &quot;Frontline&quot;.

In February 2015, The Carter Center listed 23 groups within the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army that have been documented using US-supplied TOWs.

A sudden influx of TOWs was supplied in May 2015, mostly to Free Syrian Army affiliated factions, but also independent Islamist battalions; as a requirement of being provided TOWs, these Syrian opposition groups are required to document the use of the missiles by filming their use and are also required to save the spent missile casings. Groups provided with TOWs include the Hazzm Movement, the 13th Division, 1st Coastal Division, Syria Revolutionaries Front, Yarmouk Army, Knights of Justice Brigade, and the 101st Division. Free Syrian Army battalions widely and decisively used TOWs in the 2015 Jisr al-Shughur offensive. Russia attempted a rescue operation after a Su-24M was shot down at the Syria–Turkey border on 24 November 2015, a video of Free Syrian Army 1st Coastal Division using a TOW missile to destroy a disabled Russian helicopter on the ground after its crew had retreated was posted on YouTube. In October 2015, Saudi Arabia delivered 500 TOW missiles to anti-Assad rebels.
A video produced through Bulgarian Television provides evidence of non-rebel use of this weapon by Islamic-affiliated fighters.

Reports indicate that a small number of TOW missiles have ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda in Syria and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

In August 2016 footage of the Syrian military inspecting a captured BGM-71E missile system in Bani Zeit district, Aleppo, was leaked online.
On 2 September 2016, rebels released a video of a BGM-71 TOW destroying a French-manufactured Syrian Arab Air Force Aérospatiale Gazelle as it was landing on an airstrip near Khattab in Northern Hama.

Reports say that the TOW missile has successfully hit Russian T-90s in Syria, which are equipped with active defenses designed to defeat such missiles. However, a Russian report claims the tank shows &quot;very little damage&quot; and was still operable.

===2022: Russo-Ukrainian War===
In August 2022 the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it would be sending 1,500 TOW missiles (presumably BGM-71, though not explicitly specified as such) to Ukraine as part of an additional $775m security assistance package to the &quot;meet Ukraine’s critical security and defense needs&quot; as part of ongoing US military assistance following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In April 2023, videos posted to Twitter showed Ukrainian forces using TOW missiles to destroy Russian tanks in the Bakhmut area, including their loading, use and mounting on a vehicle. A former National Security Council official said: “Such videos are just devastating. They show that even older weapons like TOW missiles can have a massive impact on Russian forces. These videos surely damage Russian morale as well.&quot;

On 19 July Hanna Maliar, Ukraine&#x27;s deputy defense minister, claimed on Telegram that an M2 Bradley had killed Russian infantry during fighting in the Zaporizhzhia region. She further claimed that using TOW missiles the M2 Bradley was able to destroy two Russian T-72 tanks. The Bradley was assigned to the 47th Mechanized Brigade. These claims could not be independently verified.

==Variants==
Raytheon (now RTX) has taken over for Hughes in recent years, and now handles production of all current variants, as well as TOW development.

While the original armor penetration estimates were 600 mm for BGM-71A/B and 700–800 mm for BGM-71C, a now declassified CIA study shows the CIA&#x27;s estimated penetration values against a vertical target are much lower—just 430 mm for the BGM-71A/B TOW and 630 mm for the BGM-71C Improved TOW.

The time to target at maximum range is 20 seconds, therefore, giving an average speed of 187.5 m/s.

==International==
Iran has reverse engineered the type from examples acquired before 1979 and currently manufactures duplicate TOW missiles. These carry the Iranian designation of Toophan.

Sweden had SAAB develop a helicopter launch system called HeliTow (Rbs 55H) for the Helikopter 9.

<doc id="338064" wikidata="Q5169218" url="?curid=338064" title="Copyright Act of 1790">
<text>The Copyright Act of 1790 was the first federal copyright act to be instituted in the United States, though most of the states had passed various legislation securing copyrights in the years immediately following the Revolutionary War. The stated object of the act was the &quot;encouragement of learning,&quot; and it achieved this by securing authors the &quot;sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending&quot; the copies of their &quot;maps, charts, and books&quot; for a term of 14 years, with the right to renew for one additional 14-year term should the copyright holder still be alive.

== Early developments ==
The 1710 British Statute of Anne did not apply to the American colonies. Only three private copyright acts were passed in the colonies prior to 1783. That year, the Continental Congress concluded &quot;that nothing is more properly a man&#x27;s own an the fruit of his study, and that the protection and security of literary property would greatly tends to encourage genius and to promote useful discoveries.&quot; But the Continental Congress had no power under the Articles of Confederation to authorize a federal copyright law; instead, it passed a resolution encouraging the states &quot;to secure to the authors or publishers of any new book not hitherto printed... the copy right of such books for a certain time not less than fourteen years from the first publication; and to secure to the said authors, if they shall survive the term first mentioned... the copy right of such books for another term of time no less than fourteen years&quot;. By 1786, the only state that had not implemented a copyright law was Delaware. Seven states modeled their law on the Statute of Anne and the Continental Congress&#x27; resolution, providing two fourteen-year terms. The remaining five states used non-renewable terms, which lasted fourteen, twenty or twenty-one years.

James Madison of Virginia and Charles C. Pinckney of South Carolina introduced proposals for the Copyright Clause during the Constitutional Convention 1787. The Copyright Clause authorized Congress &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts&quot; with utilitarian regimes for copyright and patent.

==Legislative history==
During the first session of the 1st United States Congress in 1789, the House of Representatives considered enacting a copyright law. The historian Davit Ramsay petitioned Congress seeking to restrict the publication of his &quot;History of the American Revolution&quot; on April 15. Congressmen Thomas Tudor Tucker, Alexander White, and Benjamin Huntington examined his claims and a copyright committee consisting of Huntington, Lambert Cadwalader, and Benjamin Contee began drafting the legislation on April 20. Jedidiah Morse, Nicholas Pike, and Hannah Adams each also petitioned Congress with their interests in restricting the printing of texts. Their bill moved to the Committee of the Whole House in June, but the matter was postponed in anticipation of the first recess, to be taken up again when the House reconvened.

Both houses of Congress pursued a copyright law more pointedly during 1790&#x27;s second session. They responded to President George Washington&#x27;s first 1790 State of the Union Address, in which he urged Congress to pass legislation designed for &quot;the promotion of Science and Literature&quot; so as to better educate the public. This led to the Patent Act of 1790 and, shortly thereafter, the Copyright Act of 1790.

===House of Representatives===
The scope of what works would be covered by the law&#x27;s exclusivity was contended in the House. When he reintroduced the matter, Aedanus Burke wanted to establish a first law about copyright regarding &quot;literary property&quot;, but Alexander White called for the expansion of copyright beyond writings on the behalf of Jedidiah Morse, who believed unauthorized copying of his &quot;American Geography&quot; would hurt his business.

The need to re-raise the copyright issue, among other items left unresolved at the end of the first session, required the House to clarify some order of business problems over whether or not they could reopen unfinished business from a previous session. That settled, the House established a drafting committee for the law on February 1, chaired by Abraham Baldwin.

==The act==
The bill was signed into law on May 31, 1790 by George Washington and published in its entirety throughout the country shortly after. The act granted copyright for a term of &quot;fourteen years from the time of recording the title thereof&quot; and one optional renewal. It restricted books, maps, and charts. Although musical compositions were not mentioned in the text of the act, and would not be expressly covered by copyright until the Copyright Act of 1831, they were routinely registered under the 1790 Act as &quot;books&quot;. The act also did not mention paintings or drawings, which were not covered until the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1870.

=== Provisions ===
The British Statute of Anne was used as a basis. The first sentences of the two laws are almost identical. Both require registration in order for a work to receive copyright protection; similarly, both require that copies of the work be deposited in officially designated repositories such as the Library of Congress in the United States, and the Oxford and Cambridge universities in the United Kingdom. The Statute of Anne and the Copyright Act of 1790 both provided for an initial term of 14 years, renewable once by living authors for an additional 14 years, for works not yet published. The Statute of Anne differed from the 1790 Act, however, in providing a 21-year term of restriction, with no option for renewal, for works already published at the time the law went into effect (1710). The 1790 Act only offered a 14-year term for previously published works.

=== Geographic reach ===
The Copyright Act of 1790 applied exclusively to citizens of the United States; works created outside the United States or by people who were not U.S. citizens were not copyrightable in the U.S. until the International Copyright Act of 1891. Consequently, various foreign authors, such as Charles Dickens, complained about not receiving royalty payments for copies of their work sold in the U.S.

=== Federal law ===
At the time, works only received protection under federal statutory copyright if the statutory formalities, such as a proper copyright notice, were satisfied. If this was not the case, the work immediately entered into the public domain. In 1834 the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Wheaton v. Peters&quot;, a case similar to the British &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot; of 1774, that although the author of an unpublished work had a common law right to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work.

== Amendments ==
The act was first amended on April 29, 1802, extending copyright restriction to etchings and, for the first time, requiring notice of copyright registration on copies of the works. The act did not specify a consequence of failing to include that notice; however, the federal case &quot;Ewer v. Coxe&quot; established that the failure to include notice invalidated a copyright.

The act was also amended on February 15, 1819, to expand the jurisdiction of circuit courts (analogous to today&#x27;s district courts) to allow them to hear cases on patents and copyrights.

<text>The Saskatchewan Party (SP or Sask Party) is a conservative political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The party was founded in 1997 by a coalition of former provincial Progressive Conservative and Liberal Party members who sought to unite opposition to the governing New Democratic Party. Since 2007, the Saskatchewan Party has been the province&#x27;s governing party, and both the party and the province are currently led by Premier Scott Moe.

Since first being elected to a majority government in 2007, the Saskatchewan Party has enjoyed a run of electoral success not seen in the province since the days of Tommy Douglas&#x27;s Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. In 2024, the SP was elected to its fifth consecutive majority government, a feat not achieved since the CCF led five majority governments between 1944 and 1964. This success has led observers to declare the SP the province&#x27;s new natural governing party.

Brad Wall was the first SP leader to become Premier in 2007. The party took power at a time of soaring natural resource prices, which helped to spur economic and population growth. A downturn in resource prices beginning in 2014 created challenges for the province&#x27;s economy, and in the years since the provincial debt has reached historic levels. Wall announced his retirement in 2017 and he was succeeded by Moe in 2018. Under Wall&#x27;s early leadership, the SP was considered to be a centre-right party, albeit one with a neoliberal and Christian conservative basis. In later years (and particularly under Moe&#x27;s leadership), the party is considered to have taken a turn further to the right. Under both premiers, and especially since the election of a Liberal federal government in 2015, the party has increasingly focused its attention on the federal government and espoused sentiments of western alienation within the Canadian federation.

==History==

=== Party foundations (1997–1998) ===
The Saskatchewan Party arose from a distinct political climate in the 1990s. The Progressive Conservatives led two consecutive majority governments from 1982 to 1991 under the leadership of Grant Devine. However, economic challenges, the party&#x27;s profligate spending—which left the province on the brink of bankruptcy—a close association with Brian Mulroney&#x27;s unpopular federal PCs, and a major expense fraud scandal that resulted in prison time for several members of the party all severely damaged the PCs. Under the leadership of Bill Boyd, the PCs lost nearly half of their vote share in 1995 compared to 1991, and the party was reduced to five MLAs. The Liberal Party, meanwhile, despite returning to Official Opposition status in 1995 for the first time since 1975, was being weakened by internal disputes. The New Democratic Party (NDP) under Roy Romanow took power in 1991, and rapidly addressed the fiscal crisis, balancing the province&#x27;s finances by 1995. However, this process involved numerous cuts to services that were seen as disproportionately affecting rural residents, deepening an urban-rural divide in the province that had already been widened by the PC emphasis on rural issues throughout the 1980s.

With neither the PCs nor the Liberals seeing a clear path to defeating the NDP, four MLAs from each party, all representing rural districts, agreed to walk away from their parties and form a new one. In August 1997, PC MLAs Boyd, Dan D&#x27;Autremont, Ben Heppner, and Don Toth joined former Liberal MLAs Bob Bjornerud, June Draude, Rod Gatefoer, and Ken Krawetz in announcing the founding of the Saskatchewan Party. The new party was officially registered on September 17, and with eight sitting MLAs, took over the status of Official Opposition. Krawetz, who had been serving as the leader of the Opposition with the Liberals, maintained that role when he became the interim leader of the new party. While these MLAs were the public face of the new party, the process that led to its formation involved a range of political operatives, including many involved with the federal Reform Party. Moreover, while the party openly encouraged grassroots participation, its formulation has been described as a movement by political elites.

Neither the PCs nor the Liberals disbanded after this merger of former party MLAs. However, while the Liberals ran a full slate of candidates in the 1999 election, with four being elected, the Progressive Conservatives effectively went dormant, running only paper candidates to keep the party registered over the next election cycles. This, along with the broad migration of PC members and staff to the new party, led to accusations by the NDP and the Liberal Party that the new party was merely a rebranding of the scandal-plagued PCs. Romanow often referred to the new party as the &quot;Saskatories&quot;.

=== Elwin Hermanson (1998–2004) ===
In April 1998, former Member of Parliament and Reform Party house leader Elwin Hermanson was elected the party&#x27;s first leader. Hermanson defeated former Liberal MLA Gantefoer and political newcomer Yogi Huyghebaert for the position. Since Hermanson did not have a seat in the legislature, Krawetz remained as interim house Opposition leader. The new leader stated that while people &quot;know I have the best interests of the agriculture industry and rural Saskatchewan at heart because that&#x27;s where I still live&quot;, the new party was &quot;not anti-urban.&quot; Hermanson declined to run in a 1998 Saskatoon by-election, instead waiting for the next general election to run for a seat. Under Hermanson, the party put forward an ambitious fiscal conservative platform, calling for major corporate and income tax cuts. These policies were joined by a number of controversial and social conservative policies, from a commitment to consider privatizing crown corporations to work-for-welfare policies and an end to public affirmative action.

Hermanson led the fledgling party into its first election in 1999 on this platform. The party had a strong showing, narrowly edging out the NDP in the popular vote and sweeping rural districts across the province, demonstrating the growing cleavage between urban and rural areas; the party won only a single urban seat. Overall, the SP won 25 seats and reduced the NDP—which won 29—to a minority government.

The party acknowledged the need to broaden its appeal to urban areas, and discussed moderating its social conservative image. It tabled or defeated motions at its annual conventions dealing with taxation of Indigenous residents and publicly-funded abortions. Ahead of the 2003 provincial election, the party again campaigned on a platform of tax reductions and decreased government involvement in the economy. However, it remained bogged down by questions about its conservatism and in particular its plans for crown corporations, with Hermanson continuing to state that he would be willing to entertain offers for them. The SP still led polling going into the election, and ultimately increased its seat count to 28. However, the NDP increased its share of the vote and won 30 seats, returning to a majority. The result was seen as a major letdown for the Saskatchewan Party, and Hermanson resigned as leader shortly afterward.

=== Brad Wall (2004–2018) ===

==== In Opposition (2004–2007) ====

Brad Wall, a former ministerial assistant in the Devine government who helped launch the party and was first elected as a MLA for Swift Current in 1999, was acclaimed as the new party leader on March 15, 2004 after no one else entered the race to succeed Hermanson. Wall launched a review of party policies with a view to moderating the party&#x27;s image. Through the review, the party abandoned many of its social conservative policies, such as &quot;boot camp&quot; correctional sentences and any discussion of abortions. Wall instead focused on economic issues and improvements to healthcare. Still facing questions about the Progressive Conservative expense fraud scandal, the party also drafted a Code of Ethics in 2006, intending to commit members to a standard of ethical conduct under threat of suspension. When it was revealed in 2006 that the party had received a $10,000 donation from Imperial Tobacco, Wall created a policy banning such donations. In the lead-up to the 2007 election, Wall also sought to put to rest fears about privatization, stating that &quot;Crowns are not going to be privatized and (subsidiaries) are not going to be wound down&quot;.

In 2007, the Saskatchewan Party was sued by the Progressive Conservatives over access to the nearly-$3 million PC trust fund. The PCs alleged the fund&#x27;s trustees—three of whom were active in the Saskatchewan Party—conspired with the Saskatchewan Party to deny them access to their funds as they tried to re-launch the party from its dormancy. The case was not settled until 2014, when PC leader Rick Swenson announced that his party had been given control of the fund.

By 2007, Wall&#x27;s efforts to broaden the party&#x27;s appeal appeared poised to pay off. In the 2007 provincial election on November 7, the Saskatchewan Party won 38 seats to form a majority government, making Wall the province&#x27;s 14th premier.

==== Majority government (2007–2018) ====
By all accounts, the Saskatchewan Party formed government at an opportune time, inheriting a strong economy buoyed by still-rising commodity prices, including oil, potash, and agricultural products. Wall&#x27;s government immediately used rising revenues to institute significant tax cuts, particularly income tax cuts, and to service debt reduction—in its first full fiscal year, the government paid down close to $3 billion in debt. The government released a plan for growth, calling for annually balanced budgets and for provincial debt to be halved by 2017. However, the government&#x27;s next three budgets ran deficits. The government also explored the idea of setting up a new &quot;rainy day fund&quot;, something the NDP had done in the 1970s, building an investment fund out of windfall resource prices; the government ultimately opted not to, despite the report it commissioned recommending it do so.

Wall&#x27;s government also immediately introduced labour reforms with two bills in 2007, with one restricting unionization and the other the right to strike for more than 65,000 workers deemed to be working in &quot;essential services&quot;. The latter law faced legal challenges, and in 2015 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the law was unconstitutional. Although Wall suggested a willingness to use the notwithstanding clause to keep the law, the government never did so.

In 2010, Wall and his government rose to national prominence for their opposition to a proposed takeover of Saskatoon-based PotashCorp—the world&#x27;s largest potash producer—by Australian mining company BHP. The proposed deal, worth nearly $40 billion, stood to become the largest takeover in Canadian history. However, Wall argued that the province would lose significant resource revenues, and that the takeover was against Canada&#x27;s strategic interests. The federal government blocked the deal.

The Saskatchewan Party government also significantly increased immigration to the province, making it a central policy goal, bolstering a process that had begun under the NDP—the revamped immigration process was laid out in a report written by former MLA Pat Lorje. Consequently, most of the population growth observed in the province since 2007 is attributable to immigration; inter-provincial migration has remained a net loss for the province. One area in which the Saskatchewan Party did not follow the NDPs lead was in renewable energy. Former MLA Peter Prebble had helped to launch an energy conservation office and written a report outlining a path to increased renewable energy development, but these initiatives were halted by Wall&#x27;s government.

During this term, the Saskatchewan Party began pursuing privatization of some of its assets. It sold its 49% share of SaskFerco, a significant nitrogen fertilizer producer; it began contracting out SaskTel and internal information technology services; it instructed crowns to divest of out-of-province holdings and investments; it introduced SaskBuilds to pursue public-private partnerships on infrastructure development; and it began introducing limited private-sector involvement in the healthcare system. The government also applied the Lean program, designed to find cost savings, to the health care system; a 2016 report found that the controversial program cost the province more than $1,500 for every dollar saved. In 2012, the province also began providing public funding to independent private schools; while such private schools are expected to teach the provincial curriculum, it has been reported that a number of Christian private schools employ the controversial Accelerated Christian Education curriculum.

In the 2011 provincial election, Wall and the Saskatchewan Party won a landslide victory, winning 49 of 58 seats and more than 60% of the popular vote—the highest share in the province&#x27;s history. It was during this second term that a bust in commodity prices would begin to strain provincial finances, although some of the most serious effects would not become clear for several years. In fact, in 2014—the year of a significant oil price crash—the province was awarded a AAA credit rating. It was also during this term that Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals formed a majority federal government, which led to frequent clashes between Regina and Ottawa. Shortly after the new federal government announced a plan to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada, Wall wrote to Trudeau and asked him to suspend the program, citing security concerns. Another significant development during the term was the opening of a carbon capture facility at the Boundary Dam coal power plant in Estevan, the first such industrial-scale facility in the world. Throughout this term, Wall persistently polled as the most popular premier in the country.

Wall and the Saskatchewan Party won a third term in the 2016 provincial election, with results closely aligning with the previous election. The Party was faced with major challenges early in this term, including a significant scandal involving questionable land deals during the development of the Global Transportation Hub, an inland port outside of Regina. Concerns resulted in an RCMP investigation, and although no criminal charges were laid, the Party refused to launch a public inquiry and made efforts to keep GTH-related information from the public. By 2020, the GTH had fallen $46 million into debt. Also during this term, the province frequently clashed with the federal government over resource and climate change policy. Saskatchewan refused to sign onto the Pan-Canadian climate change framework, leaving millions of dollars of funding on the table. In particular, the government expressed staunch opposition to the imposition of a federal carbon tax.

By 2017, the economic challenges facing the province became more clear. Although the government had had success in paying down debt in its early years, debt had risen to nearly $15 billion. The province&#x27;s credit rating was downgraded to AA. The Saskatchewan Party responded with a severe austerity budget in 2017—which ran the sixth deficit out of ten budgets since 2007—introducing expansions to the provincial sales tax and cuts to spending in a wide range of areas, including education, social services, libraries—the only cuts the province reversed in response to public protests—and grants to municipalities. The budget also brought the closure of the Saskatchewan Transportation Company. The budget was criticized for its disproportionate impact on the public sector, with corporate taxes remaining low. The unpopularity of the budget translated to Wall and the Saskatchewan Party, and in August Wall announced that he would be retiring from politics, with a plan to step away when a new leader was chosen and sworn in as premier in early 2018.

=== Scott Moe (2018–present) ===
The leadership race to succeed Wall as premier ultimately featured five candidates: first-term Regina MLA Tina Beaudry-Mellor; veteran Saskatoon MLA Ken Cheveldayoff, civil servant Alanna Koch, who had served as the deputy minister to the premier; MLA and environment minister Scott Moe; and another veteran Saskatoon MLA, Gordon Wyant. A sixth candidate, former MP Rob Clarke, withdrew from the race, but his name still appeared on the ballot. At the party&#x27;s 2018 leadership convention, Moe was elected leader on the fifth ballot. He was sworn in as premier on February 2, 2018.

Under Moe&#x27;s leadership, the Saskatchewan Party has continued its focus on federal relations, charging the federal Liberal government with harming the province&#x27;s economic interests. Only weeks after he took office, Moe&#x27;s government challenged the federal carbon tax in court, which ultimately made its way to the Supreme Court. In March 2021, the tax was ruled to be constitutional. Moe has consistently called for greater provincial autonomy, calling for a &quot;New Deal with Canada&quot; and referring to Saskatchewan as a &quot;nation within a nation&quot;, and asserting a desire for more control over taxation, immigration, and policing. In October 2022, the party issued a white paper on its stance against &quot;federal intrusion&quot;. The following month, the party passed the Saskatchewan First Act into law; the act reasserts provincial jurisdiction over natural resources. The act is currently facing a legal challenge by Onion Lake First Nation.

The Saskatchewan Party government led the province&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, rejecting an early call for the establishment of an all-party committee, including non-partisan experts. While the government instituted a broad range of public health measures throughout much of the first two years of the pandemic, the province was twice the first in Canada to lift all pandemic-related public health mandates, first in July 2021, and then in February 2022. Particularly once vaccines became widely available, Moe argued that the need for public health measures was diminished. By early 2022, Moe was vocal in his support of people protesting public health mandates, including the convoy that occupied downtown Ottawa. Overall, Saskatchewan was one of the hardest hit provinces; the provincial health care system was heavily strained by the pandemic, and Moe&#x27;s government was accused of failing to follow the recommendations of its public health officers.

In early 2020, Moe considered calling a snap election, despite the fixed election law that the party passed in 2008. However, the 2020 provincial election ultimately proceeded in the fall, and the Saskatchewan Party under Moe was re-elected to its fourth majority.

Since 2020, observers have noted a further rightward shift by the Saskatchewan Party, owing at least in part to the emergence of new right-wing provincial parties including the separatist Buffalo Party and the Saskatchewan United Party. The latter was founded and first led by former Saskatchewan Party MLA Nadine Wilson, who resigned from the caucus after it was revealed that she lied about her COVID vaccination status. Both parties have managed second-place finishes in rural ridings, and Moe has openly addressed their supporters. The Saskatchewan Party&#x27;s response is evident in new education policies unveiled just weeks before the new school year in the summer of 2023. The policies restrict sexual health education, including a prohibition on the involvement of third parties like sexual health centres, and require parental consent for students under 16 wishing to have their chosen names and pronouns affirmed at school. When an injunction was granted against the policy over concerns about harm to students, the government legislated the policy in the Parents&#x27; Bill of Rights and invoked the notwithstanding clause to protect the law against Charter challenges. Moreover, Moe has publicly entertained conspiracy theories, including stating at a town hall meeting that he would &quot;do some more work looking into&quot; concerns about chemtrails.

In 2024, Speaker Randy Weekes alleged in the Legislature that the Saskatchewan Party caucus was rife with bullying behaviour, and that he had been met with intimidation tactics in his role as Speaker, particularly by then-House Leader Jeremy Harrison. Weekes ultimately resigned his party membership. In the lead-up to the 2024 Saskatchewan general election, a number of other former party members disavowed the direction of the party and endorsed the NDP.

In the 2024 provincial election, the Saskatchewan Party saw its support drop; however, the party won enough seats to form its fifth consecutive majority government. That majority was reduced from seventeen seats to three by a resurgent NDP, which achieved its best electoral performance since 2003 in taking all of Regina&#x27;s districts and all but one in Saskatoon.

== Ideology ==
Since its inception, the Saskatchewan Party has been variously described as centre-right, right-wing, populist, neoliberal, and Christian conservative; however, there have been some consistent trends over time, with more moderate labels generally giving way to more conservative ones since the party first formed government. The party has also been described as right-wing populist.

Although there was some tendency to describe the party at its inception as centre-right, owing to the party&#x27;s foundation that joined together former Conservative and Liberal Party members, the earliest days of the party were dominated by discussions of its conservatism. The party had to work hard to moderate its image to achieve greater electoral success. It was successful, and in its early years in power it was commonly labelled centre-right. Moreover, there appeared to be a consensus that during his time as leader, Wall and the Saskatchewan Party became virtually synonymous, and that the party&#x27;s popularity was bolstered by Wall&#x27;s populist appeal. Wall was known to claim that people in Saskatchewan are &quot;not really interested in ideology.&quot; Early on, the party also pursued policies that were not strictly traditionally conservative, including an opposition to a foreign takeover of Saskatoon-based PotashCorp, earning the government a reputation as &quot;pragmatic&quot;. The most significant exception to this was the party&#x27;s labour policy, which has been seen as traditionally conservative since the party first gained power.

Over time, there has been a notable decrease in Liberal influence in the party, which may be partly attributable to the continued presence of the provincial Liberal Party. However, it has been noted that during their first decade in government, most party members with Liberal backgrounds retired or left the party. This was evident during the party&#x27;s 2018 leadership race, when social conservative issues like restricting abortion access became a topic of discussion for the first time since the party&#x27;s earliest days. There has been an increasing tendency to describe the Saskatchewan Party as right-wing and neoliberal, especially since the party began pursuing austerity policies when faced with economic challenges in the mid-2010s. Moreover, observers have noted that the party in recent years appears to be increasingly influenced by trends found in American conservative and far-right movements, including through its tendency to promote &quot;culture wars&quot;, or issues with stark ideological contrasts.

The Saskatchewan Party has professed to be a free-market party. Political scientist Charles Smith has argued that this position has been somewhat tempered by strong Saskatchewan traditions of supporting crown corporations and unionization. As a consequence, the Saskatchewan Party has pursued a process of &quot;active incrementalism,&quot; whereby the party works to weaken popular support for particular institutions in order to privatize them—in whole or in part—or wind them down over time. The party has also increasingly pursued public-private partnerships for new developments. By pursuing such a strategy, the party has been successful in realizing a privatization agenda since its early days in power.

== Policies and positions ==

=== Economy ===
Since coming to power in 2007, the Saskatchewan Party has maintained a commitment to the lowest corporate tax rates in the country. The province has remained among the provinces with the lowest minimum wage. In 2022, the government sent $500 tax credit cheques to residents.

The party has pursued the privatization and closure of a wide range of public assets. In 2017, the party passed a bill that would allow the government to privatize up to 49% of a crown corporation without public consultation; however, the law was repealed in 2018 in the face of public backlash. The party has also focused on bolstering direct trade relationships with other countries, establishing trade offices and conducting trade missions around the globe.

The party has tended to run deficits, and provincial debt is forecast to exceed $30 billion in 2024.

=== Education ===
The Saskatchewan Party has favoured decentralization of administration in the education system. In 2012, the party introduced public funding for qualified independent schools. The Saskatchewan Teachers&#x27; Federation has accused the Saskatchewan Party of pursuing a privatization agenda by &#x27;siphoning&#x27; funds from the public system into the private sector.

In 2023, the party introduced a Parents&#x27; Bill of Rights, which regulated the use of pronouns and gendered names in schools by requiring staff to inform parents if the student wants to go by a different name or gender identity, requiring parental consent for children under the age of 16 who wished to change their preferred pronouns while at school and placed restrictions on sexual health education in schools. During the 2024 provincial election, Moe announced his intent to immediately enact rules requiring school students to use the changing rooms that correspond to their biological sex.

=== Environment ===
The Saskatchewan Party has favoured investment in technology to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions, including carbon capture and small modular nuclear reactors. Under the party, the province has the highest GHG emissions per capita in the nation. The party has opposed federal environmental regulation, including the federal carbon tax. The province released its own climate change strategy in 2017, which has been criticized by experts for its weak targets and lack of enforcement mechanisms. While the province touts high standards of environmental regulation, much of this regime is self-monitored on the part of industry. A lack of oversight was blamed for the 2016 Husky pipeline spill of over 200,000 litres of oil into the North Saskatchewan River.

=== Federal relations ===
The Saskatchewan Party has advocated for greater autonomy for the province, citing areas like policing, immigration, and taxation as priorities. Its 2022 Saskatchewan First Act re-asserted the province&#x27;s constitutional rights to natural resources. The province has challenged federal efforts at regulating the environment and resource development, including the carbon tax and environmental assessments.

=== Healthcare ===
The Saskatchewan Party introduced the Lean program to the healthcare system in a bid to cut costs. The party has persistently expanded the use of private clinics and privatized services within the public system. In 2023, the government paid a private Calgary clinic $10 million to perform surgeries for Saskatchewan residents.

=== Immigration ===
The Saskatchewan Party has increased immigration to the province, and has advocated for greater provincial control over the immigration process.

== Federal affiliation ==
The Saskatchewan Party is not officially affiliated with any federal political party. However, the party has long been attached with federal conservatives, who since the turn of the twenty-first century have largely dominated federal politics in Saskatchewan. The populist Reform Party of Canada was often cited as an inspiration for the formulation of the Saskatchewan Party, and many Reform members were involved in its establishment. The Saskatchewan Party&#x27;s first leader, Elwin Hermanson, had been a Reform MP. In 2000, Reform rebranded as the Canadian Alliance, and in 2003 the Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservatives to form the new Conservative Party of Canada, which since its inception has had significant overlap with the Saskatchewan Party.

A number of Conservative MPs have been involved with the Saskatchewan Party. Examples include Carol Skelton, who served on Elwin Hermanson&#x27;s constituency executive; Tom Lukiwski, who served as a General Manager of the Saskatchewan Party; Garry Breitkreuz, who supported the formation of the party; and Lynne Yelich, who worked for Allan Kerpan while Kerpan served as MP and received funding from him in the 2006 federal election. Warren Steinley and Corey Tochor are Conservative MPs who previously served as Saskatchewan Party MLAs. Brad Wall was considered a contender for leadership of the federal Conservatives ahead of leadership elections in 2017 and 2019, but both times he declined to enter the race. Wall did, however, play a behind-the-scenes role in founding an American-style political action committee called the Buffalo Project in 2018. The project was designed to lobby and fund political candidates with the aim of electing conservatives provincially and federally.

As recently as the 2023 Saskatchewan Party convention, the Saskatchewan and Conservative parties endorsed each other. At that convention, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre praised the Saskatchewan Party for its legal battles against the federal government over resource and environmental policies, while Moe endorsed Poilievre and the Conservatives ahead of the next federal election.

<text>Engine turning is a form of ornamental turning. The finishing technique may use lathes or engines to produce a pattern. Aluminium is often the metal chosen to decorate. The technique has been used in various industries, including aircraft and document verification.

== Description ==
Engine turning is a form of ornamental turning. The technique geometrically applies a single-point cutting tool to produce a decorative metal surface finish pattern.

Traditionally, engine turning referred to Guilloché engraving. In the 20th century, it also came to refer to the different process of &#x27; (also known as spotting, jewelling, perlage), which is a fine geometric pattern of overlapping circles abraded onto the surface.

=== Equipment ===
Guilloché engine turning may be done with various machines, including rose engines, straight-line engines, brocade engines, and ornamental turning lathes. Perlage uses an abrasive rotating disk or dowel.

=== Material ===
Aluminium is often the metal chosen to decorate with jewelling, but any appropriate surface can be finely machined to produce intricate repetitive patterns that offer reflective interest and fine detail.

==Uses==
===Aircraft===

&quot;&quot;-style engine turning was used on the sheet metal panels of the engine cowling (nose) of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s aircraft, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;.

The sheet metal parts of the World War I Fokker &quot;Eindecker&quot; fighters aircraft series, especially around the engine cowl and associated sheet metal, are noted for having a &quot;dragged&quot; form of engine turning entirely covering them. The tool creating the &quot;swirls&quot; was repeatedly moved along a short, irregular path each time while pressed against the metal, to create the intricate appearance that was characteristic of the aircraft&#x27;s sheet-metal parts. It is partly surmised to have been a mechanical method to &quot;clad&quot; a duralumin-alloy sheet-metal panel with a layer of pure aluminum, for corrosion protection.

===Automobiles===

In the 1920s and 1930s, automobile parts such as valve covers, which are right on top of the engine, were also decorated with perlage engine turning. Similarly, dashboards or the instrument panel of the same were often perlaged. Customizers also would similarly decorate their vehicles with perlage engine-turned panels.

===Documents===
Engravings produced by engine turning are often incorporated into the design of bank notes, and other high-value documents, to make counterfeiting difficult. The resulting graphics are called guillochés.

===Firearms===

Perlage engine turning is also used on various firearm components to prevent corrosion by holding traces of oil and lubricants on the surface, in turn to a polished surface resulting in a smooth operation.

=== Watchmaking ===
Guilloché and perlage are traditional techniques used in have been used in the watch-making.

<text>The Baltic Sea Region, alternatively the Baltic Rim countries (or simply the Baltic Rim), and the Baltic Sea countries/states, refers to the general area surrounding the Baltic Sea, including parts of Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. Unlike the &quot;Baltic states&quot;, the Baltic region includes all countries that border the sea.

== Etymology ==
The first to name it the &quot;Baltic Sea&quot; () was 11th century German chronicler Adam of Bremen.

== Denotation ==
Depending on the context the &quot;Baltic Sea Region&quot; might stand for:

* The countries that have shorelines along the Baltic Sea: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Sweden.
* The group of countries that are members of the inter-governmental &quot;Baltic Assembly&quot; and &quot;Baltic Council of Ministers&quot;, and generally referred to by the shorthand, Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
* Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, exclaved from the remainder of Russia.
* Historic East Prussia and the historical lands of Livonia, Courland and Estonia (Swedish Estonia and Russian Estonia).
* The former Baltic governorates of Imperial Russia: Today&#x27;s Estonia and Latvia (excluding parts of modern Eastern Latvia that were part of Vitebsk Governorate).
* The countries on the historical British trade route through the Baltic Sea, i.e. including the Scandinavian Peninsula (Sweden and Norway).
* The negotiating members of the Grand Baltic Entente also known as the Baltic League: Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland.
* Members of the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS), are the countries with shorelines along the Baltic Sea, in addition to Norway, Iceland and the European Commission.
* The islands of the Euroregion B7 Baltic Islands Network, which includes the islands and archipelagos Åland (autonomous region of Finland), Bornholm (Denmark), Gotland (Sweden), Hiiumaa (Estonia), Öland (Sweden), Rügen (Germany), and Saaremaa (Estonia).
* On historic Scandinavian and German maps, the &quot;Balticum&quot; sometimes includes only the historically or culturally German-dominated lands, or provinces, of Estonia, Livonia, Courland and Latgale (corresponding to modern Estonia and Latvia), East Prussia, Samogitia (corresponding to modern Western Lithuania) as well as sometimes Pomerania, Kashubia, while the historically less-Germanized Eastern Lithuania is occasionally excluded.
*In geology, the Baltic Shield includes Fennoscandia, parts of northwestern Russia and the northern Baltic Sea.

<doc id="338082" wikidata="Q2575857" url="?curid=338082" title="Gastric intubation">
<text>Nasogastric intubation is a medical process involving the insertion of a plastic tube (nasogastric tube or NG tube) through the nose, down the esophagus, and down into the stomach. Orogastric intubation is a similar process involving the insertion of a plastic tube (orogastric tube) through the mouth. Abraham Louis Levin invented the NG tube. Nasogastric tube is also known as Ryle&#x27;s tube in Commonwealth countries, after John Alfred Ryle.

==Uses==
A nasogastric tube is used for feeding and administering drugs and other oral agents such as activated charcoal. For drugs and for minimal quantities of liquid, a syringe is used for injection into the tube. For continuous feeding, a gravity based system is employed, with the solution placed higher than the patient&#x27;s stomach. If accrued supervision is required for the feeding, the tube is often connected to an electronic pump which can control and measure the patient&#x27;s intake and signal any interruption in the feeding. Nasogastric tubes may also be used as an aid in the treatment of life-threatening eating disorders, especially if the patient is not compliant with eating. In such cases, a nasogastric tube may be inserted by force for feeding against the patient&#x27;s will under restraint. Such a practice may be highly distressing for both patients and healthcare staff.
Nasogastric aspiration (suction) is the process of draining the stomach&#x27;s contents via the tube. Nasogastric aspiration is mainly used to remove gastrointestinal secretions and swallowed air in patients with gastrointestinal obstructions. Nasogastric aspiration can also be used in poisoning situations when a potentially toxic liquid has been ingested, for preparation before surgery under anesthesia, and to extract samples of gastric liquid for analysis.

If the tube is to be used for continuous drainage, it is usually appended to a collector bag placed below the level of the patient&#x27;s stomach; gravity empties the stomach&#x27;s contents. It can also be appended to a suction system, however this method is often restricted to emergency situations, as the constant suction can easily damage the stomach&#x27;s lining. In non-emergency situations, intermittent suction is often applied giving the benefits of suction without the untoward effects of damage to the stomach lining.

Suction drainage is also used for patients who have undergone a pneumonectomy in order to prevent anesthesia-related vomiting and possible aspiration of any stomach contents. Such aspiration would represent a serious risk of complications to patients recovering from this surgery.

==Types==

Types of nasogastric tubes include:
* Levin catheter, which is a single lumen, small bore NG tube. It is more appropriate for administration of medication or nutrition. This type of catheter tends to be more prone to suctioning against the stomach lining, which can cause damage and interfere with future function of the tube.
* Salem Sump catheter, which is a large bore NG tube with double lumen. This avails for aspiration in one lumen, and venting in the other to reduce negative pressure and prevent gastric mucosa from being drawn into the catheter.
* Dobhoff tube, which is a small bore NG tube with a weight at the end intended to pull it by gravity during insertion. The name &quot;Dobhoff&quot; refers to its inventors, surgeons Dr. Robert Dobbie and Dr. James Hoffmeister, who invented the tube in 1975.

==Materials==
Nasogastric tubes are available in a variety of different materials, each with their own unique properties.

* Polypropylene - This material is most common. It is less likely to kink, which can be beneficial for placement, but its rigidity makes it less suitable to be used for long term feeding.
* Latex - These tubes tend to be thicker and can be difficult to place without proper lubrication. Latex tends to break down at faster rates compared to other materials. Allergies to latex are relatively common and latex tubes are more likely to be recognized as a foreign object by the body.
* Silicone - Especially useful in patients with known latex allergies. Silicone tubes tend to be thinner and more pliable. This can be useful in some situations but can also be more prone to rupture under stress.

==Technique==

Before an NG tube is inserted, it must be measured from the tip of the patient&#x27;s nose, loop around their ear and then down to roughly below the xiphoid process. The tube is then marked at this level to ensure that the tube has been inserted far enough into the patient&#x27;s stomach. Many commercially available stomach and duodenal tubes have several standard depth markings, for example , , and from distal end; infant feeding tubes often come with 1 cm depth markings. The end of a plastic tube is lubricated (local anesthetic, such as 2% xylocaine gel, may be used; in addition, nasal vasoconstrictor and/or anesthetic spray may be applied before the insertion) and inserted into one of the patient&#x27;s anterior nares. Treatment with 2.0 mg of IV midazolam greatly reduces patient stress. The tube should be directed straight towards the back of the patient as it moves through the nasal cavity and down into the throat. When the tube enters the oropharynx and glides down the posterior pharyngeal wall, the patient may gag; in this situation the patient, if awake and alert, is asked to mimic swallowing or is given some water to sip through a straw, and the tube continues to be inserted as the patient swallows. Once the tube is past the pharynx and enters the esophagus, it is easily inserted down into the stomach. The tube must then be secured in place to prevent it from moving. There are several ways to secure an NG placement. One method and the least invasive is tape. Tape is positioned and wrapped around the NG tube onto the patients nose to prevent dislodgement.

Another securement device is a nasal bridle, or a device that enters one nare, around the nasal septum, and then to the other nare where it is secured in place around the nasogastric tube. There are two ways a bridle is put into place. One method, according to the Australian Journal of Otolaryngology, is performed by a physician to pull a material through the nares and then tied with the ends shortened to prevent removal of the tube. The other method is a device called the Applied Medical Technology, or AMT, bridle. This device uses a magnet inserted into both nares that connects at the nasal septum and then pulled through to one side and tied. This technology allows nurses to safely apply bridles. Several studies have proven the use of a nasal bridle prevents the loss of the NG placement that provides necessary nutrients or suctioning. A study conducted in the UK from 2014 through 2017, determined that 50% of feeding tubes secured with tape were lost inadvertently. The use of bridle securement decreased the percentage of NGs lost from 53% to 9%.

Great care must be taken to ensure that the tube has not passed through the larynx into the trachea and down into the bronchi. The reliable method is to aspirate some fluid from the tube with a syringe. This fluid is then tested with pH paper (note not litmus paper) to determine the acidity of the fluid. If the pH is 4 or below then the tube is in the correct position. If this is not possible then correct verification of tube position is obtained with an X-ray of the chest/abdomen. This is the most reliable means of ensuring proper placement of an NG tube. The use of a chest x-ray to confirm position is the expected standard in the UK, with Dr/ physician review and confirmation. Future techniques may include measuring the concentration of enzymes such as trypsin, pepsin, and bilirubin to confirm the correct placement of the NG tube. As enzyme testing becomes more practical, allowing measurements to be taken quickly and cheaply at the bedside, this technique may be used in combination with pH testing as an effective, less harmful replacement of X-ray confirmation. If the tube is to remain in place then a tube position check is recommended before each feed and at least once per day.

Only smaller diameter (12 Fr or less in adults) nasogastric tubes are appropriate for long-term feeding, so as to avoid irritation and erosion of the nasal mucosa. These tubes often have guidewires to facilitate insertion. If feeding is required for a longer period of time, other options, such as placement of a PEG tube, should be considered.

Function of an NG tube properly placed and used for suction is maintained by flushing. This may be done by flushing small amounts of saline and air using a syringe or by flushing larger amounts of saline or water, and air, and then assessing for the air to circulate through one lumen of the tube, into the stomach, and out the other lumen. When these two techniques of flushing were compared, the latter was more effective.

==Contraindications==
The use of nasogastric intubation is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe neck and facial fractures due to the increased risk of airway obstruction or improper tube placement. Special attention is necessary during insertion under these circumstances in order to avoid undue trauma to the esophagus. There is also a greater risk to patients with bleeding disorders, particularly those resulting from the distended sub-mucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus known as esophageal varices which may be easily ruptured due to their friability and also in GERD(Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease).

Alternative measures, such as an orogastric intubation, should be considered under these circumstances, or if the patient will be incapable of meeting their nutritional and caloric needs for an extended time period (usually &gt;24 hours).

==Complications==
Complications with nasogastric intubation can occur due to incorrect initial placement of the nasogastric tube or due to changes in tube position that go unrecognized. Nasogastric tubes mistakenly placed in the trachea or lungs can lead to aspiration of enteral feeds or medications administered through the NG tube. This can also lead to pneumothorax or pleural effusion, which often requires a chest tube to drain. Nasogastric tubes can also be mistakenly placed within the intracranial space; this is more likely to occur in patient who already have specific types of skull fractures.

Other complications include clogged or nonfunctional tubes, premature removal of the tube, erosion of the nasal mucosa, esophageal perforation esophageal reflux, nose bleeds, sinusitis, sore throat and gagging.

Fox News Digital reported about a voluntary field correction notice dated March 21, 2022, referenced 60 injuries and 23 deaths related to misplacement of a nasogastric tube. Avanos Medical&#x27;s &quot;Cortrak2 EAS recall&quot;, has been classified as a Class I recall by the FDA, following these reports.

<text>Ruth Crawford Seeger (born Ruth Porter Crawford; July 3, 1901 – November 18, 1953) was an American composer and musicologist. Her music heralded the emerging modernist aesthetic, and she became a central member of a group of American composers known as the &quot;ultramodernist&quot;. She composed primarily during the 1920s and 1930s, turning towards studies on folk music from the late 1930s until her death. Her music influenced later composers including Elliott Carter.

She is best known for her String Quartet (1931). It is &quot;regarded as one of the finest modernist works of the genre&quot;.

==Childhood==
Ruth Crawford Seeger was born on July 3, 1901, in East Liverpool, Ohio, the second child of Methodist minister Clark Crawford and Clara Crawford (&quot;née&quot; Graves). The family moved several times during Crawford&#x27;s childhood, living in Akron, Ohio, St. Louis, and Muncie, Indiana. In 1912, the family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where Clark died of tuberculosis two years later. After her husband&#x27;s death, Clara opened a boarding house and struggled to maintain her family&#x27;s middle-class lifestyle. 

Ruth began writing poetry at an early age and as a teenager had aspirations to become an &quot;authoress or poetess&quot;. She also studied the piano beginning at age six. In 1913, she began piano lessons with Bertha Foster, who had founded the School of Musical Arts in Jacksonville in 1908. In 1917, Ruth began studying with Madame Valborg Collett, a student of Agathe Backer Grøndahl and the most prestigious teacher at Foster&#x27;s school. After she graduated from high school in 1918, Crawford began to pursue a career as a concert pianist, continuing her studies with Collett and performing at various musical events in Jacksonville. She also became a piano teacher at Foster&#x27;s school and wrote her first compositions for her young pupils in 1918 and 1919.

==Career==
===Chicago===

Crawford moved to Chicago in 1921, where she enrolled at the American Conservatory of Music. She initially planned to stay for a single year, long enough to earn a teaching certificate. In Chicago, she attended symphony and opera performances for the first time, as well as recitals by eminent pianists including Sergei Rachmaninoff and Arthur Rubinstein. She studied piano with Heniot Levy and Louise Robyn at the conservatory, though her focus quickly shifted from piano performance to composition. During her second year at the conservatory, she began composition and music theory studies with Adolf Weidig and wrote several early works, including a Nocturne for Violin and Piano (1923) and a set of theme and variations for piano (1923). Clara Crawford moved to Chicago to live with her daughter in 1923. The next year, Ruth received her bachelor&#x27;s degree and subsequently enrolled in the American Conservatory&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree program.

While Crawford continued to study theory and composition with Weidig through 1929, in 1924 she also began private piano lessons with Djane Lavoie-Herz. One of the most prestigious piano teachers in Chicago at the time, Herz had a profound impact on Crawford&#x27;s intellectual and musical life. Herz sparked Crawford&#x27;s interest in Theosophy and the Theosophy-influenced music of Russian composer Alexander Scriabin, and introduced her pupil to an influential community of artists and thinkers including Dane Rudhyar and Henry Cowell. During this time, Crawford also met poet Carl Sandburg, whose writings she would eventually set to music. In 1925, she composed “The Adventures of Tom Thumb,” an experiment which combined spoken word with music.

===New York City and travels in Europe===
Crawford spent the summer of 1929 at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, on a scholarship, where she began a friendship with fellow composer Marion Bauer and began work on her Five Songs set to poems by Sandburg. Crawford moved into the New York City home of music patron Blanche Walton and began studying composition with Charles Seeger that autumn.

In 1930, Crawford became the first female composer to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship, and used the grant money to travel to Berlin and Paris. She inquired about a renewal of her fellowship several times over the course of the next year, which was ultimately refused. During that time, she interviewed Emil Hertzka to discuss publishing her music, but he said that &quot;it would be particularly hard for a woman to get anything published.&quot; Crawford subsequently travelled to Vienna and Budapest to meet with Alban Berg and Béla Bartók in order to discuss her music and gain support for publication. Though surrounded by exponents of German modernism, she chose to study and compose alone. Charles Seeger&#x27;s ideas, communicated to her by letter, were crucial to the development of her style and selections. 
She and Seeger married in 1932 after she made a trip to Paris. At the 1933 International Society for Contemporary Music Festival in Amsterdam, her &quot;Three Songs&quot; for voice, oboe, percussion and strings, which set poems by Sandburg, represented the United States.

===Washington, D.C.===
Crawford Seeger and her family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1936 after Charles&#x27; appointment to the music division of the Resettlement Administration. She worked closely with folklorists John and Alan Lomax at the Library of Congress&#x27; Archive of American Folk Song to preserve and teach American folk music. Her arrangements and interpretations of American folk songs are among the most respected. These include transcriptions for &quot;American Folk Songs for Children&quot;, &quot;Animal Folk Songs for Children&quot; (1950), &quot;American Folk Songs for Christmas&quot; (1953), &quot;Our Singing Country&quot; (1941), and &quot;Folk Song USA&quot; by John and Alan Lomax. She also composed &quot;&quot;Rissolty, Rossolty&quot; – An American Fantasy for Orchestra&quot;, based on folk tunes, for the CBS radio series &quot;The American School of the Air&quot;.

Crawford Seeger returned to her modernist roots in early 1952 with her &quot;Suite for Wind Quintet&quot;, but died of intestinal cancer in November of the following year.

==Family==

In 1932, she married Charles Seeger. Their children, including Mike Seeger, Peggy Seeger, Barbara, Penny, and older stepson Pete Seeger, knew their mother as &quot;Dio&quot;. Several of the children as musical artists themselves became central to the American folk music revival, but had little knowledge of their mother&#x27;s earlier works. Her children went on to record some of her folksong compilations.

==Compositions==
The compositions that Crawford Seeger wrote in Chicago from 1924 to 1929 reflect the influence of Alexander Scriabin, Dane Rudhyar, and her piano teacher Djane Lavoie-Herz. Judith Tick calls these years Crawford Seeger&#x27;s &quot;first distinctive style period&quot; and writes that the composer&#x27;s music during this time &quot;might be termed &#x27;post-tonal pluralism. Her compositions from this first style period, including Five Preludes for Piano, Sonata for Violin and Piano, Suite No. 2 for Strings and Piano, and &quot;Five Songs on Sandburg Poems&quot; (1929), are marked by strident dissonance, irregular rhythms, and evocations of spirituality.

Crawford Seeger&#x27;s reputation as a composer rests chiefly on her New York compositions written between 1930 and 1933, which exploit dissonant counterpoint and American serial techniques. During these years, Crawford began to incorporate polytonality and tone clusters into her compositions. She was one of the first composers to extend serial processes to musical elements other than pitch and to develop formal plans based on serial operations. Her technique may have been influenced by the music of Arnold Schoenberg, although they met only briefly during her studies in Germany. Many of her works from this period also employ dissonant counterpoint, a theoretical compositional system developed by Charles Seeger and also used by Henry Cowell, Johanna Beyer, and other &quot;ultramodernists&quot;. Seeger outlined his methodology for dissonant counterpoint in his treatise, &quot;Tradition and Experiment in (the New) Music&quot;, which he wrote with the input and assistance of Crawford during the summer of 1930. Crawford Seeger&#x27;s contribution to the book was significant enough that the possibility of co-authorship was briefly raised.

Crawford Seeger&#x27;s String Quartet (1931), particularly its third movement, is her most famous and influential work. She described the &quot;underlying plan&quot; of the third movement as &quot;a heterophony of dynamics—a sort of counterpoint of crescendi and diminuendi. ... The melodic line grows out of this continuous increase and decrease; it is given, one tone at a time, to different instruments, and each new melodic tone is brought in at the high point in a crescendo&quot;.

== Influence on music education ==

Ruth Crawford Seeger’s contributions extend beyond her work in modern classical music; she was a central figure in the revival of American folk music and its integration into children’s music education. Her innovative approach has left a lasting impact on how folk music is used in teaching.

Crawford&#x27;s interest in American folk music deepened after her marriage to Charles Seeger. Together, they explored the cultural and social significance of folk music during the Great Depression, a time when folk traditions were at risk of being forgotten. In 1935, she collaborated with John and Alan Lomax to transcribe over 800 field recordings, a project that enriched her understanding of traditional American music. This endeavor not only influenced her composition but also shaped her family’s legacy. Her children, particularly Peggy Seeger, became leading figures in the American folk music movement, with Peggy recalling, “The house resounded with music morning, noon, and night”.

While living in Silver Spring, Maryland, Crawford began her direct engagement with children’s music education. At her daughter Barbara’s cooperative nursery school, Crawford initially felt uneasy in her role as a teacher’s aide but quickly adapted. One pivotal moment came when she personalized the folk tune &quot;Mary Wore Her Red Dress&quot;, incorporating the names and clothing of the children in her class. This experience inspired her to create a music booklet featuring simple piano arrangements of American folk songs for children and caregivers.

The booklet, designed during the Great Depression, was a breakthrough in making music education accessible. Its straightforward arrangements allowed parents—particularly mothers—to learn and play with their children, bringing music into homes and fostering a greater appreciation for folk traditions.

Ruth Crawford Seeger&#x27;s work in transcribing, arranging, and teaching folk music laid the foundation for its integration into mid-twentieth-century music education, shaping repertoire and practices in schools. Her legacy in this field continues to influence music educators today .

<text>Eric, stylized as Eric, is the ninth &quot;Discworld&quot; novel by Terry Pratchett. It was originally published in 1990 as a &quot;&quot;Discworld&quot; story&quot;, in a larger format than the other novels and illustrated by Josh Kirby. It was later reissued as a normal paperback without any illustrations, and in some cases, with the title given on the cover and title pages simply as &quot;Eric&quot;. (The page headers, however, continued to alternate between &quot;&quot; and &quot;Eric&quot;.)

== Plot summary ==
The story is a parody of the tale of Faust, and follows the events of &quot;Sourcery&quot; in which the Wizard Rincewind was trapped in the Dungeon Dimensions. Rincewind is summoned by the thirteen-year-old demonologist, Eric Thursley, who wanted a demon to grant his heart&#x27;s desires. He is disappointed when Rincewind tells him he is unable to grant wishes. Rincewind is disheartened to learn that the spells to confine demons work on him; Eric&#x27;s parrot tells him that because he was summoned as a demon, he is subject to the same terms. The arrival of Rincewind&#x27;s Luggage causes Eric to suspect deceit on Rincewind&#x27;s part. Eric&#x27;s demands are renewed and Rincewind finds that snapping his fingers allows him to grant the following wishes.

* To be Ruler of the World. Eric and Rincewind are transported to the rain forests of Klatch in the Tezumen empire (a parody of the Aztec Empire). The locals declare Eric Ruler of the World. During this tribute, Rincewind and the parrot explore the temple of Quezovercoatl (a parody of Quetzalcoatl), where they find a prisoner, Ponce da Quirm (a parody of Juan Ponce de León), who is to be sacrificed. Da Quirm tells Rincewind about the terrible fate the Tezumen have planned for the Ruler of the World, on whom they blame all of life&#x27;s misfortunes. Rincewind, Eric and da Quirm are tied up at the top of a pyramid to be sacrificed, when Quezovercoatl makes his appearance. Unfortunately for him, the Luggage also makes an appearance, trampling the six-inch-tall Quezovercoatl in the process. The Tezumen, pleased to see Quezovercoatl destroyed, release the prisoners and deify the Luggage in the place of their god. 
* To Meet the Most Beautiful Woman in All History. Rincewind transports himself and Eric inside in a large wooden horse (a parody of the Trojan Horse). Exiting, they are surrounded by Tsortean soldiers, who take them for an Ephebian invasion force. Rincewind manages to talk their way out from the guards and out of the city, only to fall into the hands of the invading army. Rincewind and Eric are taken to Lavaeolus, the man who built the horse as a decoy so that he and his men could sneak in while their enemies waited around the horse for them to come out. They re-enter Tsort through a secret passage, and find Elenor (a parody of Helen of Troy). Eric and Lavaeolus are disappointed to find that Elenor is now a plump mother of several children, and that artistic licence had been taken in her description. The Ephebians escape the city while Tsort burns, and Lavaeolus and his army set out for home. Eric notes that &quot;Lavaeolus&quot; in Ephebian translates to &quot;Rinser of Winds&quot;, hinting that Lavaeolus is an ancestor of Rincewind.
* To Live Forever. Rincewind brings Eric and him outside time, just before the beginning of existence. They meet the Creator, who is just forming the Discworld. Rincewind and Eric are left on the newly formed world, with the realisation that &quot;to live forever&quot; means to live for all time, from start to finish. To escape, Rincewind has Eric reverse his summoning, taking them both to hell.

They discover hell steeped in bureaucracy, the Demon King Astfgl having decided that boredom might be the ultimate form of torture. Rincewind uses his university experience to confuse the demons, so he and Eric can escape. While crossing through the recently reformed levels of hell (satirical forms of Dante&#x27;s Inferno) they encounter da Quirm and the parrot, as well as Lavaeolus, who tells them where the exit is.

The source of Rincewind&#x27;s demonic powers is revealed to be Lord Vassenego, a Demon Lord leading a secret revolt against Astfgl. Using Rincewind to keep Astfgl occupied while gathering support amongst the demons, Vassenego confronts his king just as Astfgl finally catches up to Rincewind and Eric. Vassenego announces the council of demons has made Astfgl &quot;Supreme Life President of Hell&quot;, and that he is to plan out the course of action for demons. With Astfgl lost in the bureaucratic prison of his own making, Vassenego takes over as king and lets Rincewind and Eric escape, so that stories about hell can be told. As they leave, Rincewind and Eric notice that the path they are fleeing along has good intentions written on each cobble.

==Characters==

*Eric Thursley, a 13-year-old demonologist who wanted to summon a demon, but ends up inadvertently rescuing Rincewind from an eternity in the Dungeon Dimensions. 
*Rincewind
*The Luggage

==Reception==
&quot;Starburst&quot; has called it &quot;a series of hilarious pokes at the cliché that is hell&quot;. Gardner Dozois, conversely, considered it &quot;downright bad, the only Discworld book [he] actively disliked and found a chore to read&quot;. In 2011 The novel was included in the &quot;Gollancz 50&quot; series. The series marked the publisher&#x27;s 50th anniversary by re-issuing seminal works of science fiction.

==In other media==
* An audio serialization of the novel, in four episodes of about fifteen minutes each, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in March 2013.

<text>A dowager is a widow or widower who holds a title or property – a &quot;dower&quot; – derived from her or his deceased spouse. As an adjective, &quot;dowager&quot; usually appears in association with monarchical and aristocratic titles.

In popular usage, the noun &quot;dowager&quot; may refer to any elderly widow, especially one of wealth and dignity or aristocratic manner.

Some dowagers move to a separate residence known as a dower house.

==Use==


===In the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom the widow of a peer or baronet may continue to use the style she had during her husband&#x27;s lifetime, e.g. &quot;Countess of Loamshire&quot;, provided that his successor, if any, has no wife to bear the plain title. Otherwise she more properly prefixes either her forename or the word &quot;Dowager&quot;, e.g. &quot;Jane, Countess of Loamshire&quot; or &quot;Dowager Countess of Loamshire&quot;. (In any case, she would continue to be called &quot;Lady Loamshire&quot;.)

The term &quot;queen dowager&quot; is used in the United Kingdom and several other countries for the widow of a king; when the dowager is the mother of the current monarch she is more often known as the queen mother.

In the Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom, a dowager peer ranks above her daughter-in-law (the wife of her son, the incumbent peer); this is different to queens dowager, where a daughter-in-law (i.e., the more recent queen) will rank above her mother-in-law.

=== In Sinosphere ===
Empress dowager is the title given to the mother or widow of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese emperor. A notable example is Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively ruled China for over 47 years.

=== In other regions===
This form of address is used for noble ladies whose husbands have died. It was used for the late Queen Dowager, Fabiola of Belgium. 

Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain was known as a dowager queen after the death of her husband.

The widowed wives of Russian emperors were bestowed the title of Dowager Empress, and ranked above the wife of the reigning emperor.

==Informal==
Elderly widows of wealth, prominence, and dignified or autocratic manner are often referred to informally as dowagers. 

Dowagers portrayed in literature include the Dowager Duchess of Merton in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot;.

Maggie Smith portrayed Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham from 2010 to 2015 in the television series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, and in the 2019 movie sequel &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; and the 2022 film &quot;Downton Abbey: A New Era&quot;.

<doc id="338104" wikidata="Q580340" url="?curid=338104" title="Irish poetry">
<text>Irish poetry is poetry written by poets from Ireland, politically the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland today. It is mainly written in Irish, though some is in English, Scottish Gaelic and others in Hiberno-Latin. The complex interplay between the two main traditions, and between both of them and other poetries in English and Scottish Gaelic, has produced a body of work that is both rich in variety and difficult to categorise.

The earliest surviving written poems in Irish date back to the 6th century , while the first known poems in English from Ireland date to the 14th century. Although there has always been some cross-fertilization between the two language traditions, an English-language poetry that had absorbed themes and models from Irish did not finally emerge until the 19th century. This culminated in the work of the poets of the Irish Literary Revival in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Towards the last quarter of the 20th century, modern Irish poetry tended to a wide range of diversity, from the poets of the Northern school to writers influenced by the modernist tradition and those facing questions posed by an increasingly urban and cosmopolitan society.

==Early Irish poetry==
Literacy reached Ireland with Christianity in the fifth century. Monasteries were established, which by the seventh century were large, self-governing institutions and centres of scholarship. This was to have a profound effect on Irish-language literature, poetry included.

The earliest Irish poetry was unrhymed, and has been described as follows: &quot;It is alliterative syllabic verse, lyric in form and heroic in content, in praise of famous men, or in lament for the death of a hero&quot;. It survived as epic interludes in Irish sagas in the early Modern Period.

The monastic poets borrowed from both native and Latin traditions to create elaborate syllabic verse forms, and used them for religious and nature poetry. The typical combination of end-rhyme, internal rhyme and alliteration came originally from the example of late Latin hymns, as elaborated by Irish monks. The new metres are the vehicle for monastic lyric poems inspired by love of Nature, love of solitude and love of the Divine which have been described as the finest Irish poetry of their age, and which could be extended to cover more personal concerns. An example is a long poem which is put into the mouth of Marbán the hermit, brother of Guaire, king of Connacht, and of which the following is an excerpt:

The professional secular poets continued to praise and lament famous men, but adopted the new verse forms, which in time would be codified in classical form under the name &quot;Dán Díreach&quot;.

==Medieval/early modern==

Irish bards formed a professional hereditary caste of highly trained, learned poets. The bards were steeped in the history and traditions of clan and country, as well as in the technical requirements of a verse technique that was syllabic and used assonance, half rhyme and alliteration known as Dán Díreach.

As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles. They were chroniclers and satirists whose job it was to praise their employers and damn those who crossed them. It was believed that a well-aimed bardic satire, &quot;glam dicin&quot;, could raise boils on the face of its target. However, much of their work would not strike the modern reader as being poetry at all, consisting as it does of extended genealogies and almost journalistic accounts of the deeds of their lords and ancestors.

The Metrical Dindshenchas, or Lore of Places, is probably the major surviving monument of Irish bardic verse. It is a great onomastic anthology of naming legends of significant places in the Irish landscape and comprises about 176 poems in total. The earliest of these date from the 11th century, and were probably originally compiled on a provincial basis. As a national compilation, the Metrical Dindshenchas has come down to us in two different recensions. Knowledge of the real or putative history of local places formed an important part of the education of the elite in ancient Ireland, so the Dindshenchas was probably a kind of textbook in origin.

Verse tales of Fionn and the Fianna, sometimes known as Ossianic poetry, were extremely common in Ireland and Scotland throughout this period. Originally sung in verse and exactly on par with heroic epics from other cultures, they were written down and significantly altered by James Macpherson in the 18th century. Macpherson&#x27;s treatment of them was said to have ushered in the Romance tradition as opposed to the epic nature of the sagas. The Fionn poems form one of the three key sagas of Celtic culture: The Ulster saga, Fionn mac Cumhaill saga, and those of the Arthurian legends.

British Library Manuscript, Harley 913, is a group of poems written in Ireland in the early 14th century. They are usually called the Kildare Poems because of their association with that county. Both poems and manuscript have strong Franciscan associations and are full of ideas from the wider Western European Christian tradition. They also represent the early stages of the second tradition of Irish poetry, that of poetry in the English language, as they were written in Middle English.

During the Elizabethan reconquest, two of the most significant English poets of the time saw service in the Irish colonies. Sir Walter Raleigh had little impact on the course of Irish literature, but the time spent in Munster by Edmund Spenser was to have serious consequences both for his own writings and for the future course of cultural development in Ireland. Spenser&#x27;s relationship with Ireland was somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, an idealised Munster landscape forms the backdrop for much of the action for his masterpiece, &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. On the other, he condemned Ireland and everything Irish as barbaric in his prose polemic &quot;A View of the Present State of Ireland&quot;.
In &quot;A View&quot;, he describes the Irish bards as being: 
Given that the bards depended on aristocratic support to survive, and that the balance of power was shifting towards the new Anglo-Irish landlords, Spenser&#x27;s condemnation of the Bards&#x27; preference for outlawed Clan Chiefs over the new elite may well have contributed to their demise as a caste.

==Gaelic poetry in the 17th century==

The Battle of Kinsale in 1601 saw the defeat of Aodh Mór Ó Néill, despite his alliance with the Spanish, and the ultimate victory in the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland came with his surrender to crown authority in 1603. In consequence, the system of education and patronage that underpinned the professional bardic schools came under pressure, and the hereditary poets eventually engaged in a spat - the Contention of the bards - that marked the end of their ancient influence. During the early 17th century a new Gaelic poetry took root, one that sought inspiration in the margins of a dispossessed Irish-speaking society. The language of this poetry is today called Early Modern Irish. Although some 17th-century poets continued to enjoy a degree of patronage, many, if not most, of them were part-time writers who also worked on the land, as teachers, and anywhere that they could earn their keep. Their poetry also changed, with a move away from the syllabic verse of the schools to accentual metres, reflecting the oral poetry of the bardic period. A good deal of the poetry of this period deals with political and historical themes that reflect the poets&#x27; sense of a world lost.

The poets adapted to the new English-dominated order in several ways. Some of them continued to find patronage among the Gaelic Irish and Old English aristocracy. Some of the English landowners settled in Ireland after the Plantations of Ireland also patronised Irish poets, for instance George Carew and Roger Boyle. Other members of hereditary bardic families sent their sons to the new Irish Colleges that had been set up in Catholic Europe for the education of Irish Catholics, who were not permitted to found schools or universities at home. Much of the Irish poetry of the 17th century was therefore composed by Catholic clerics and Irish society fell increasingly under Counter-Reformation influences. By mid-century, the subordination of the native Catholic upper classes in Ireland boiled over in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Many Irish language poets wrote highly politicised poetry in support of the Irish Catholics organised in Confederate Ireland. For instance, the cleric poet Pádraigín Haicéad wrote, &quot;Éirigh mo Dhúiche le Dia&quot; (&quot;Arise my Country with God&quot;) in support of the rebellion, which advised that
Another of Haicéad&#x27;s poems &quot;Muscail do mhisneach a Banbha&quot; (&#x27;Gather your courage oh Ireland&#x27;) in 1647 encouraged the Irish Catholic war effort in the Irish Confederate Wars. It expressed the opinion that Catholics should not tolerate Protestantism in Ireland,
Following the defeat of the Irish Catholics in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–53), and the destruction of the old Irish landed classes, many poets wrote mourning the fallen order or lamenting the destruction and repression of the Cromwellian conquest. The anonymous poem &quot;an Siogai Romanach&quot; went,
Another poem by Éamonn an Dúna is a strange mixture of Irish, French and English,


After this period, the poets lost most of their patrons and protectors. In the subsequent Williamite War in Ireland Catholic Jacobites tried to recover their position by supporting James II. Dáibhi Ó Bruadair wrote many poems in praise of the Jacobite war effort and in particular of his hero, Patrick Sarsfield. The poets viewed the war as revenge against the Protestant settlers who had come to dominate Ireland, as the following poem extract makes clear,

The Jacobites&#x27; defeat in the War, and in particular James II&#x27;s ignominious flight after the Battle of the Boyne, gave rise to the following derisive verse,

The main poets of this period include Dáibhí Ó Bruadair (1625?–1698), Piaras Feiritéar (1600?–1653) and Aogán Ó Rathaille (1675–1729). Ó Rathaille belongs as much to the 18th as the 17th century and his work, including the introduction of the &quot;aisling&quot; genre, marks something of a transition to a post-Battle of the Boyne Ireland.

===Female poets===
The first part of the seventeenth century saw three notable female poets (all born in the previous century).

Brighid Nic Gearailt (Brighid Chill Dara) (c. 1589-1682) was the wife of Rudhraighe Ó Domhnaill, one of the O&#x27;Donnell dynasty who left Ireland as part of the Flight of the Earls. Her sole surviving work is &quot;A Mhacaoimh Dhealbhas an Dán&quot;, a witty and elegant reply in classical metre to a verse letter sent to her on behalf of Cú Chonnacht Óg Mág Uidhir by Eochaidh Ó hEoghusa, a notable poet of the time.

Fionnghuala Ní Bhriain (Inghean Dhomhnaill Uí Bhriain) (c. 1557-1657), a member of the O&#x27;Brien dynasty, who had been Chiefs of the Name and Earls of Thomond, wrote a lament (her only surviving poem) for her husband, Uaithne Ó Lochlainn, Chief of the Name and Lord of Burren in County Clare.

Caitilín Dubh (fl. 1624), whose patrons were also the O’Brien dynasty, wrote for them a series of laments in the new accentual metres.

==The 18th century==
The eighteenth century saw the flourishing of highly literate, technically adept poets in the Irish language. This period saw the triumph of popular accentual metres, as opposed to the elaborate syllabic metres which had prevailed until then. These accentual metres, however, still featured a complex system of internal rhymes, and it is likely that they had been in use for some centuries previously. The poets themselves seldom had patrons to support them and supported themselves with such occupations as farming or teaching.

A salient figure at this time is Aogán Ó Rathaille (1670–1726), a bridge between the old world in which he was educated and the new one in which the professional poet had no place. He wrote in the new metres but preserved the attitudes of a previous age.

Dublin was a centre of Irish-language poetry in the first half of the eighteenth century, due to the presence there of Seán Ó Neachtain, his son Tadhg and the circle of writers they gathered around them. Seán wrote both in Irish and English, but Irish was his primary language and he wrote poems in it of many kinds – Fenian poems, love poems, drinking songs, satires and religious poems.

In 1728 Tadhg wrote a poem in which there is a description of the members of the Ó Neachtain literary circle: twenty-six people are mentioned, mostly from Leinster but with others from every province.

Outside Dublin, it was in the province of Munster that the status and craft of Irish-language poetry were best maintained. Sometimes a local clan chief or Anglo-Irish landlord acted as their patron, but in other places responsibility lay with &quot;cúirteanna filíochta&quot; – &quot;courts of poetry&quot; or local gatherings for the purpose of contests between poets, similar to the Welsh Eisteddfod. These could be seen as offshoots of the bardic academies which trained professional poets down to the seventeenth century.

The best-known members of this network of poets included Seán Ó Tuama (c. 1706–1775), Aindrias Mac Craith (died c. 1795), Liam Ruadh Mac Coitir and Seamus McMurphy (Seán na Ráithíneach). Their poetry illuminates daily life and personalities of the period – landlord and tenant, the priest and the teacher, the poet and the craftsman, the marketplace, marriage and burial, music and folklore. 
The craft of poetry was also cultivated in south Ulster, where poets would similarly come together to compete for primacy. They included a handful of women, including Máire (or Mailligh) Nic a Liondain and Peig Ní Chuarta.

Among the most prominent names in Munster is Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin, schoolmaster, sailor, soldier, and a rake by reputation. His verse was highly finished and intensely musical, and he was best known for his vision poems. This genre, and the Munster tradition of the &quot;cúirteanna filíochta&quot; – &quot;courts of poetry&quot;, were parodied by Brian Merriman in his lengthy comic poem &quot;Cúirt An Mheán Oíche&quot;. In the poem, the women of Ireland sue the men for refusing to marry and father children, before the judgement seat of Aoibheall, a member of the Tuatha De Danaan who, since Saint Patrick, has been demoted from goddess to being the local fairy queen.

Alongside the work of the literate poets there flourished a traditional oral literature. One of its products was the &quot;caoineadh&quot; or traditional lament, a genre dominated by women and typically characterised by improvisation and passion. Countless numbers were composed; one of the few to have survived is &quot;Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire&quot;. This was mostly composed by a noblewoman from the Roman Catholic O&#x27;Connell family of Derrynane House, who continued to rule over their tenants in County Kerry like the Chiefs of an Irish clan. The poet was Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill (an aunt of Daniel O&#x27;Connell), after her husband, Art O&#x27;Leary, was outlawed for refusing to sell his pedigreed stallion to a local Anglo-Irish judge, hunted down, and shot dead by a of redcoats acting under the judge&#x27;s personal command. It is considered to be an outstanding example of the type.

===Swift and Goldsmith===
In Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), Irish literature in English found its first notable writer. Although best known for prose works like &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;, Swift was a poet of considerable talent. Technically close to his English contemporaries Pope and Dryden, Swift&#x27;s poetry evinces the same tone of savage satire, and horror of the human body and its functions that characterises much of his prose. Swift also published translations of poems from the Irish.

Oliver Goldsmith (1730?–1774) started his literary career as a hack writer in London, writing on any subject that would pay enough to keep his creditors at bay. He came to belong to the circle of Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke and Sir Joshua Reynolds. His reputation depends mainly on a novel, &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;, a play, &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, and two long poems, &quot;The Traveller&quot; and &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;. The last of these may be the first and best poem by an Irish poet in the English pastoral tradition. It has been variously interpreted as a lament for the death of Irish village life under British rule and a protest at the effects of agricultural reform on the English rural landscape.

===Weaver Poets and vernacular writing===
Local cultural differences in areas such as north and east Ulster produced minor, and often only loosely associated, vernacular movements that do not readily fit into the categories of Irish or English literature. For example, the Ulster Weaver Poets wrote in an Ulster Scots dialect.

Working-class or popular in nature, remaining examples are mostly limited to publication in self-published privately subscribed limited print runs, newspapers, and journals of the time.

The promotion of standard English in education gradually reduced the visibility and influence of such movements. In addition, the polarising effects of the politics of the use of English and Irish language traditions also limited academic and public interest until the studies of John Hewitt from the 1950s onwards. Further impetus was given by more generalised exploration of non-&quot;Irish&quot; and non-&quot;English&quot; cultural identities in the latter decades of the 20th century.

==The 19th century==
During the course of the 19th century, political and economic factors resulted in the decline of the Irish language and the concurrent rise of English as the main language of Ireland. This fact is reflected in the poetry of the period.

The folk tradition of poetry in Irish (usually expressed in song) retained its vigour in the 19th century, often combing assonance and alliteration to considerable effect. Songs of all sorts were common in Irish-speaking areas before Ireland&#x27;s Great Famine of the 1840s - love songs such as &quot;Dónall Óg&quot; and &quot;Úna Bhán&quot;, songs about the ancient heroes of the Fianna, working songs, religious songs, laments, humorous and satirical songs, lullabies and children&#x27;s songs. Songs of the supernatural (changelings, revenants, spirits) were also popular. Patriotic songs were rare. The poetic quality of the love songs in particular has been described as unusually high:
 
The Great Famine, with its material and sociological consequences, had a considerable effect on Irish music. The number of Irish speakers declined because of death or emigration. There was a radical shift in land use, with tillage giving way to pasture, which was less labour-intensive. Songs to do with ploughing, reaping and sowing could no longer be sustained. There were, however, contemporary songs in Irish about the Famine itself, such as &quot;An Drochshaol&quot; (from West Cork), &quot;Amhrán na bPrátaí Dubha&quot; (from County Waterford), and &quot;Johnny Seoighe&quot; (from Conamara).

There was already an Irish tradition of songs in English. This included English songs, Lowland Scottish songs and ballads which were printed in England and sold in Ireland, such as &quot;Lord Baker&quot;, &quot;Captain Wedderburn’s Courtship&quot; and &quot;Barbara Allen&quot;, together with political ballads of Irish origin. After the Famine and with the loss of Irish speakers, such songs became dominant.

The interactive relationship between Irish and English is evident in the songs composed in English by Irish-speaking hedge school masters from the late 18th century on. These songs (some of which were parodies) often had a Latinate vocabulary. It has been said that they had a style &quot;which, while capable of descending to the ridiculous, could also rise to the sublime&quot;. These songs and others often reproduced the metre and internal rhymes of songs in Irish:
 
Antoine Ó Raifteiri (Anthony Raftery) (1784–1835) is a recognized Irish-language folk poet of the pre-Famine period. But the tradition of literate composition persisted. The Kerry poet Tomás Rua Ó Súilleabháin (1785–1848) was a schoolmaster, musician and dancing master; the Cork poet Mícheál Óg Ó Longáin (1766-1837) was a well-known copier of manuscripts.

Paradoxically, as soon as English became the dominant language of Irish poetry, the poets began to mine the Irish-language heritage as a source of themes and techniques. J. J. Callanan (1795–1829) was born in Cork and died at a young age in Lisbon. Unlike many other more visibly nationalist poets who would follow later, he knew Irish well, and several of his poems are loose versions of Irish originals. Although extremely close to Irish materials, he was also profoundly influenced by Byron and his peers; possibly his finest poem, the title work of &quot;The Recluse of Inchidony and Other Poems&quot; (1829), was written in Spenserian stanzas that were clearly inspired by &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;.

The best-known Irish poet to draw upon Irish themes in the first half of the 19th century was probably Thomas Moore (1779–1852), although he had no knowledge of, and little respect for, the Irish language. He attended Trinity College Dublin at the same time as the revolutionary Robert Emmet, who was executed in 1803. Moore&#x27;s most enduring work, &quot;Irish Melodies&quot;, was popular with English readers. They contain stereotyped images but helped in the development of a distinctive English-language poetic tradition in Ireland.

In 1842, Charles Gavan Duffy (1816–1903), Thomas Davis, (1814–1845), and John Blake Dillon (1816–1866) founded &quot;The Nation&quot; to agitate for reform of British rule. The group of politicians and writers associated with &quot;The Nation&quot; came to be known as the Young Irelanders. The magazine published verse, including work by Duffy and Davis, whose &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; is still popular among Irish Nationalists. However, the most significant poet associated with &quot;The Nation&quot; was undoubtedly James Clarence Mangan (1803–1849). Mangan was a true &quot;poète maudit&quot;, who threw himself into the role of bard, and even included translations of bardic poems in his publications.

Another poet who supported the Young Irelanders, although not directly connected with them, was Samuel Ferguson (1810–1886). Ferguson once wrote that his ambition was &quot;to raise the native elements of Irish history to a dignified level.&quot; To this end, he wrote many verse retellings of the Old Irish sagas. He also wrote a moving elegy to Thomas Davis. Ferguson, who believed that Ireland&#x27;s political fate ultimately lay within the Union, brought a new scholarly exactitude to the study and translation of Irish texts.

William Allingham (1824–1889) was another important Unionist figure in Irish poetry. Born and bred in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, he spent most of his working life in England and was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, and a close friend of Tennyson. His &quot;Day and Night Songs&quot; was illustrated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais. His most important work is the long poem, &quot;Laurence Bloomfield in Ireland&quot; (1864), a realist narrative which wittily and movingly deals with the land agitation in Ireland during the period. He was also known for his work as a collector of folk ballads in both Ireland and England.

Ferguson&#x27;s research opened the way for many of the achievements of the Celtic Revival, especially those of W. B. Yeats (1865–1939) and Douglas Hyde (1860–1949), but this narrative of Irish poetry which leads to the Revival as culmination can also be deceptive and occlude important poetry, such as the work of James Henry (1798–1876), medical doctor, Virgil scholar and poet. His large body of work was completely overlooked until Christopher Ricks included him in two anthologies, and eventually edited a selection of his poetry.

===The Celtic revival===
Probably the most significant poetic movement of the second half of the 19th century was French Symbolism. This movement inevitably influenced Irish writers, not least Oscar Wilde (1845–1900). Although Wilde is best known for his plays, fiction, and &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;, he also wrote poetry in a symbolist vein and was the first Irish writer to experiment with prose poetry. However, the overtly cosmopolitan Wilde was not to have much influence on the future course of Irish writing. W. B. Yeats was much more influential in the long run. Yeats, too, was influenced by his French contemporaries but consciously focused on an identifiably Irish content.
As such, he was partly responsible for the establishment of the literary movement known as the Celtic Revival. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923.

Apart from Yeats, much of the impetus for the Celtic Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was Douglas Hyde, later the first President of Ireland, whose &quot;Love Songs of Connacht&quot; was widely admired.

==The 20th century==

===Yeats and modernism===
In the 1910s, Yeats became acquainted with the work of James Joyce, and worked closely with Ezra Pound, who served as his personal secretary for a time. Through Pound, Yeats also became familiar with the work of a range of prominent modernist poets. From his 1916 book &quot;Responsibilities and Other Poems&quot; onwards his work, while not entirely meriting the label modernist, became much more hard-edged than it had been.

Modernism, with its emphasis on technical and intellectual innovation, was to influence early 20th-century Irish poets writing both in English and Irish. Among them were those associated with the Easter Rising of 1916. Three of the Republican leadership, Pádraig Pearse (1879–1916) (who wrote in Irish), Joseph Mary Plunkett (1879–1916) and Thomas MacDonagh (1878–1916), were noted poets. Much of their verse is Catholic and Nationalistic in outlook, but their work is of considerable historical interest.

An individual from these groups is the Boyne Valley &quot;peasant poet&quot; Francis Ledwidge, who was pressured by the Irish Volunteers into enlisting in the British Army during World War I. After years of fighting as he believed for the rights of small nations like his own, Ledwidge was &quot;blown to bits&quot; by a German artillery shell during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917.

However, it was to be Yeats&#x27; earlier Celtic mode that was to be most influential. Amongst the most prominent followers of the early Yeats were Pádraic Colum (1881–1972), F. R. Higgins (1896–1941), and Austin Clarke (1896–1974). In the 1950s, Clarke, returning to poetry after a long absence, turned to a much more personal style and wrote many satires on Irish society and religious practices. Irish poetic Modernism took its lead not from Yeats but from Joyce. The 1930s saw the emergence of a generation of writers who engaged in experimental writing as a matter of course. The best-known of these is Samuel Beckett (1906–1989), who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1969. Beckett&#x27;s poetry, while not inconsiderable, is not what he is best known for. The most significant of the second generation of Modernist Irish poets who first published in the 1920s and 1930s include Brian Coffey (1905–1995), Denis Devlin (1908–1959), Thomas MacGreevy (1893–1967), Blanaid Salkeld (1880–1959), and Mary Devenport O&#x27;Neill (1879–1967). Coffey&#x27;s two late long poems &quot;Advent&quot; (1975) and &quot;Death of Hektor&quot; (1982) are perhaps his most important works; the latter deals with the theme of nuclear apocalypse through motifs from Greek mythology.

It has been remarked that the work of Beckett, Devlin and MacGreevy displays the prime characteristics of the avant-garde: the problem of a disintegrating subjectivity; a lack of unity between the self and the society; and self-conscious literary pastiche.

It has been said that the notion of an &quot;Irish modernism&quot; is challenged by the number of Irish writers who did not fully engage with modernist experiments, an apathy noted by Irish, continental and Anglo-American critics. There were still key experimental writers in Ireland during the 1930s (Kate O’Brien, Elizabeth Bowen and others) whose work was marked by aesthetic self-consciousness and self-reflexiveness, but it could also be argued that much Irish writing was part of an international reaction against modernism.

While Yeats and his followers wrote about an essentially aristocratic Gaelic Ireland, the reality was that the actual Ireland of the 1930s and 1940s was a society of small farmers and shopkeepers. From this environment emerged poets who rebelled against the example of Yeats, but who were not Modernist by inclination. Patrick Kavanagh (1904–1967), who came from a small farm, wrote about the narrowness and frustrations of rural life. John Hewitt (1907–1987), whom many consider to be the founding father of poetry in Northern Ireland also came from a rural background but lived in Belfast and was amongst the first Irish poets to write of the sense of alienation that many at this time felt from both their original rural and new urban homes. Louis MacNeice (1907–1963), another poet from Northern Ireland, was associated with the left-wing politics of Michael Roberts&#x27;s anthology &quot;New Signatures&quot; but was much less political a poet than W. H. Auden or Stephen Spender, for example. MacNeice&#x27;s poetry was informed by his immediate interests and surroundings and is more social than political.

In the Republic of Ireland, a post-modernist generation of poets and writers emerged from the late 1950s onwards. Prominent among these writers were the poets Antony Cronin, Pearse Hutchinson, John Jordan, Thomas Kinsella and John Montague, most of whom were based in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s. In Dublin a number of new literary magazines were founded in the 1960s: &quot;Poetry Ireland&quot;, &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;The Lace Curtain&quot;, and in the 1970s, &quot;Cyphers&quot;.

===The Northern School===
With large Protestant minority and enduring political links to Great Britain, some believe that the culture of Northern Ireland differs form that on the rest of the island and this has had an effect on its literature.

In addition to John Hewitt, mentioned above, other important poets from Northern Ireland include Robert Greacen (1920–2008) who, with Valentin Iremonger, edited an important anthology, &quot;Contemporary Irish Poetry&quot; in 1949. Greacen was born in Derry, lived in Belfast in his youth and then in London during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He won the Irish Times Prize for Poetry in 1995 for his &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, after he returned to live in Dublin when he was elected a member of &quot;Aosdana&quot;. Other poets of note from this time include Roy McFadden (1921–1999), a friend for many years of Greacen. Padraic Fiacc (born 1924), was born in Belfast, but lived in America during his youth. In the 1960s, and coincident with the rise of the Troubles in the province, a number of Ulster poets began to receive critical and public notice. Prominent amongst these were John Montague (born 1929), Michael Longley (born 1939), Derek Mahon (born 1941), Séamus Heaney (1939-2013) and Paul Muldoon (born 1951).

Heaney was probably the best-known of these poets. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995, and served as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory and Emerson Poet in Residence at Harvard, and as Professor of Poetry at Oxford.

Derek Mahon was born in Belfast and worked as a journalist, editor, and screenwriter while publishing his first books. He published comparatively little.

Muldoon is Howard G. B. Clark &#x27;21 Professor in the Humanities at Princeton University. In 1999 he was also elected Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford.

===Experiment===
In the late 1960s, two young Irish poets, Michael Smith (born 1942) and Trevor Joyce (born 1947) founded in Dublin the New Writers Press publishing house and a journal called &quot;The Lace Curtain&quot;. Initially this was to publish their own work and that of some like-minded friends (including Paul Durcan, Michael Hartnett and Gerry Smyth), and later to promote the work of neglected Irish modernists like Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin. Both Joyce and Smith have published considerable bodies of poetry in their own right.

Among the other poets published by the New Writers Press were Geoffrey Squires (born 1942), whose early work was influenced by Charles Olson, and Augustus Young (born 1943), who admired Pound and who has translated older Irish poetry, as well as work from Latin America and poems by Bertolt Brecht. Younger poets who write what might be called experimental poetry include Maurice Scully (born 1952), William Wall (born 1955) and Randolph Healy (born 1956). Many of these poets, along with younger experimentalists, have performed their work at the annual SoundEye Festival in Cork.

Some of the Irish poets develop the Surrealist trend in Irish poetry, notably Ciaran O&#x27;Driscoll (born 1943) and younger poets including John W. Sexton (born 1958), Medbh McGuckian, Tony Kitt and Tony Bailie. Their style has been described as &quot;tangential Surrealism&quot;.

===Outsiders===
In addition to these two loose groupings, a number of prominent Irish poets of the second half of the 20th century could be described as outsiders, although these poets could also be considered leaders of a mainstream tradition in the Republic. These include Thomas Kinsella (born 1928), whose early work was influenced by Auden. Kinsella&#x27;s later work exhibits the influence of Pound in its looser metrical structure and use of imagery but is deeply personal in manner and matter.

John Jordan (1930–1988) was an Irish poet born in Dublin on 8 April 1930. He was a celebrated literary critic from the late 1950s until his death in June 1988 in Cardiff, Wales, where he had participated in the Merriman Summer School. Jordan was also a short-story writer, literary editor, poet and broadcaster. His poetry collections include &quot;Patrician Stations&quot;, &quot;A Raft from Flotsam&quot;, &quot;With Whom Did I Share the Crystal&quot;, &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, and &quot;Selected Poems&quot;.

Basil Payne (1923) was born in Dublin on June 23, 1923. His published work amounts to three slim volumes, and numerous inclusions in anthologies of Irish poetry.

Hugh McFadden (1942–) worked for many years as a newspaper journalist and book reviewer. His own collections of poems include &quot;Cities of Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Pieces of Time&quot;, &quot;Elegies &amp; Epiphanies&quot;, and &quot;Empire of Shadows&quot;.

===Women poets (in English)===
The second half of the century also saw the emergence of a number of women poets including Eavan Boland (born 1944), Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin (born 1942), Vona Groarke, Kerry Hardie, Kate Newmann, Medbh McGuckian, Paula Meehan, and Rita Ann Higgins. Boland has written widely on specifically feminist themes and on the difficulties faced by women poets in a male-dominated literary world. Ní Chuilleanáin&#x27;s poetry shows her interest variously in explorations of the sacred, women&#x27;s experience, and Reformation history. She has also translated poetry from a number of languages. Higgins is an unconventional poet whose work confronts social injustices.

==Contemporary poetry in Irish==
During the Gaelic revival, a regular Irish-language column titled &quot;Ón dhomhan diar&quot;, generally about the hardships faced by immigrants to the United States, was contributed to Patrick Pearse&#x27;s &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot; by Pádraig Ó hÉigeartaigh (1871-1936). Ó hÉigeartaigh, an immigrant from Uíbh Ráthach, County Kerry, worked in the clothing business and lived with his family in Springfield, Massachusetts. Ó hÉigeartaigh also wrote poetry for the same publication in Munster Irish. His poem &quot;Ochón! a Dhonncha&quot; (&quot;My Sorrow, Dhonncha!&quot;), a lament for the drowning of his six-year old son on 22 August 1905, appeared in Pearse&#x27;s magazine in 1906. Although the early authors of the Gaelic revival preferred the literary language once common to the Bards of both Ireland and Scotland and felt only scorn for the oral poetry of the surviving Gaeltachtaí, Ó hÉigeartaigh drew upon that very tradition to express his grief and proved that it could still be used effectively by a 20th-century poet. Ó hÉigeartaigh&#x27;s lament for his son has a permanent place in the literary canon of Irish poetry in the Irish language and has been translated into English by both Patrick Pearse and Thomas Kinsella.

Louis De Paor has alleged that the execution of Patrick Pearse by a British Army firing squad following the defeat of the Easter Rising of 1916, was a catastrophe for Irish literature in the Irish language. This is because Pearce&#x27;s surviving poetry was radically innovative and shows the influences of Walt Whitman, Modernist poetry, and of the French Symbolists. It wouldn&#x27;t be, according to De Paor, until the 1940s that Irish language poetry began to recover from the loss of Patrick Pearse.

One of the most talented 20th-century Irish-language poets and folklore collectors in the Irish diaspora was Seán Ó Súilleabháin (Sean &quot;Irish&quot; O&#x27;Sullivan) (1882-1957). Ó Súilleabháin, whom literary scholar Ciara Ryan has dubbed &quot;Butte&#x27;s Irish Bard&quot;, was born into a family of Irish-speaking fishermen upon Inishfarnard, a now-uninhabited island off the Beara Peninsula of County Cork. In 1905, Ó Súilleabháin sailed aboard the ocean liner &quot;Lucania&quot; from Queenstown to Ellis Island and settled in the heavily Irish-American mining community of Butte, Montana. Following his arrival, Ó Súilleabháin never returned to Ireland. In Montana, however, he learned for the first time to read and write in his native language, married, and raised a family. Ó Súilleabháin remained a very influential figure in Butte&#x27;s Irish-American literary, cultural, and Irish republican circles for the rest of his life.

In the O&#x27;Sullivan Collection in the Butte-Silver Bow Archives, Ó Súilleabháin is also revealed to have been a highly talented poet who drew inspiration from poets such as Diarmuid Ó Sé, Máire Bhuidhe Ní Laoghaire, and Pádraig Phiarais Cúndún, who adapted the Jacobite tradition of Aisling poetry to more recent political struggles. For this reason, Ó Súilleabháin&#x27;s surviving Aisling poems are inspired by the events of the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence; such as &quot;Cois na Tuinne&quot;, &quot;Bánta Mín Éirinn Glas Óg&quot;, and the highly popular 1919 poem &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot;. According to the poet&#x27;s son, Fr. John Patrick Sarsfield O&#x27;Sullivan (&quot;Fr. Sars&quot;), his father recited &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; aloud during Éamon de Valera&#x27;s 1919 visit to Butte. The future Taoiseach of the Irish Republic was reportedly so impressed that he urged Ó Súilleabháin to submit the poem to &quot;Féile Craobh Uí Gramnaigh&quot; (&quot;O&#x27;Growney&#x27;s Irish Language Competition&quot;) in San Francisco. Ó Súilleabháin took de Valera&#x27;s advice and won both first prize and the Gold Medal for the poem.

Seán Ó Súilleabháin&#x27;s papers also include transcriptions of the verse of other local Irish-language poets. One prominent example is the poem &quot;Amhrán na Mianach&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Mining&quot;), which, &quot;lays bare the hardships of a miner&#x27;s life&quot;, was composed in Butte by Séamus Feiritéar (1897-1919), his brother Mícheál, and their childhood friend Seán Ruiséal. Other song transcribed in Ó Súilleabháin&#x27;s papers was composed in 1910 by Séamus Ó Muircheartaigh, a Butte mine worker from Corca Dhuibhne, County Kerry, who was nicknamed &quot;An Spailpín&quot; (&quot;The Farmhand&quot;). The poem, which has eight stanzas and is titled, &quot;Beir mo Bheannacht leat, a Nellie&quot; (&quot;Bring My Blessings with You, Nellie&quot;) was composed while Ó Muircheartaigh&#x27;s wife, Nellie, and their son, Oisín, were on an extended visit to Ireland.

With the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1923, it became official government policy to promote and protect the Irish language. Despite its failures, this policy did further the revival in Irish-language literature which had started around 1900. In particular, the establishment in 1925 of &quot;An Gúm&quot; (&quot;The Project&quot;), a Government-sponsored publisher, created an outlet both for original works in Irish and for translations into the language.

The most important poet of the era between the death of Pearse and the literary revolution of the late 1940s was Liam Gógan (1891-1979). Gógan, a Dublin-born poet, lexicographer, and member of the Irish civil service, had, according to Louis De Paor, &quot;a prodigious knowledge of all the spoken dialects of Irish and the Gaelic literary tradition.&quot;

After refusing to take an oath of allegiance to King George V following the Easter Rising of 1916, Gógan had been dismissed from his post in the National Museum of Ireland and imprisoned at Frongoch internment camp in Wales. Gógan had, according to De Paor, an encyclopedic knowledge of the Western canon, which found its way into his poetry. Gógan was also the first poet to write sonnets in the Irish language.

Unlike most other Irish language poets, who choose to compose in particular regional dialects, Gógan believed that a standard literary language, similar to those found in other European countries, needed to be developed. Gógan believed that the basis for the new standard Irish should be in older forms of the language and particularly in Old Irish and Classical Gaelic, the literary language once taught in the Bardic schools of both Ireland and the Scottish Highlands and Islands. As no one else has since embraced Gógan&#x27;s theories about creating a standard literary form of Irish, David Wheatley has described Gógan&#x27;s poetry, as &quot;knotty&quot;, &quot;undervalued&quot;, and sometimes extremely difficult to understand or to translate. While trying to translate Gógan into English, Wheatley has written that he often thought of Myles na gCopaleen&#x27;s famous quip about the literary use of previously unknown Irish language terms, &quot;I don&#x27;t think those words are in &quot;Séadhna&quot;.&quot;

Colm Breathnach, who set out to re-popularize Gógan&#x27;s poetry during the 2017 &quot;Imram&quot; literary festival, has said of Gógan, &quot;He was a moderniser, he was trying to develop the language. He employed old words and forms, he coined new words (particularly compound words) from the existing resources of the language and mixed various dialectical usages throughout his work. Readers often found it difficult to follow these experiments... Some of his work would resonate with people today, he has a lot of love poetry, other works would portray urban angst, others are in a household setting.&quot;

Poetry in Irish saw a revolution beginning in the end of the 1940s with the poetry of Máirtín Ó Direáin (1910-1988), Seán Ó Ríordáin (1916-1977) and Máire Mhac an tSaoi (1922-2021). Their poetry, though retaining a sense of the tradition, continued the legacy of Pearse by introducing Modernist poetry into the Irish language.

According to Louis De Paor, &quot;Máire Mhac an tSaoi spent two years studying in post-war Paris (1945-47) before joining the Irish diplomatic service, and was working at the Irish embassy in Madrid, during Franco&#x27;s regime, when she committed herself to writing poetry in Irish following her discovery of the works of Federico Garcia Lorca. The tension between religious beliefs, contemporary social mores, and the more transgressive elements of female desire is central to the best of her work from the 1940s and early 50s. Both her deference to traditional patterns of language and verse and her refusal of traditional morality might be read as a reaction to the social, moral, and cultural upheaval of a world at war.&quot;

Also of that generation was Eoghan Ó Tuairisc (1919-1982), an Irish-language poet and novelist from Ballinasloe, County Galway who had served as a commissioned officer in the Irish Army during The Emergency.

Like Diarmaid Ó Súilleabháin, Ó Tuairisc and other writers of their generation, &quot;challenged the critical orthodoxy by openly proclaiming that their standards could not be those of the Gaeltacht and by demanding a creative freedom that would acknowledge hybridity and reject the strictures of the linguistic purists.&quot;

In his 1964 poetry collection &quot;Lux aeterna&quot;, Ó Tuairisc included a long poem inspired by the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, entitled &quot;Aifreann na marbh&quot; (&quot;Mass for the Dead&quot;). The poem is an imitation of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass, &quot;with the significant omission of &#x27;Credo&#x27; and &#x27;Gloria.&#x27;&quot;

According to Louis De Paor, &quot;The poem also draws on early Irish literature to articulate Ó Tuairisc&#x27;s idea that the poet has a responsibility to intercede in the eternal struggle between love and violence through the unifying, healing, power of creative imagination. While everyone is culpable in the annihilation of Hiroshima, the poet, the word-priest, bears a particular burden of responsibility.&quot;

Mac an Tsaoi, Ó Direáin, and Ó Tuairisc were the precursors of an even more radical group of poets, including Liam Ó Muirthile (1950-2018), Gabriel Rosenstock and Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, whose poetry, first published in the 1970s and 1980s, reflected contemporary international influences. The poet and sean-nós singer Caitlín Maude (1941-1982) also belonged to that group. Other younger poets of note were Louis de Paor and Cathal Ó Searcaigh.

Other poets include Derry O&#x27;Sullivan, who, though long resident in Paris, has continued to publish in Irish. This is also true of Tomás Mac Síomóin, an Irish writer resident in Spain. Another published poet is Pádraig Mac Fhearghusa, for a long time the editor of Feasta.

Modern Irish-language poetry is notable for the growing number of women poets. They include Rita Kelly (widow of Eoghan Ó Tuairisc), Biddy Jenkinson (a nom de plume), Áine Ní Ghlinn and Bríd Ní Mhóráin, and younger writers such as Ciara Ní É, Doireann Ní Ghríofa and Ailbhe Ní Ghearbhuigh.

It has been argued that, since the Irish language depends for its continued existence on government patronage and the efforts of cultural activists, all poetry in the language is political to a certain extent: &quot;It is an assertion of pride, an appeal for identity, a staking out of cultural territory&quot;.

Bilingualism has been a consistent feature of contemporary Irish poetic practice. Among the more notable examples was Michael Hartnett (1941–1999), who was fluent in both Irish and English. He won praise for his work in English, but in his 1975 book &quot;A Farewell to English&quot; he declared his intention to write only in Irish. A number of volumes in Irish followed but in 1989 he returned to English. Eoghan Ó Tuairisc, also bilingual, made no formal renunciation of either language but published in both in several genres.
In 2009, poet Muiris Sionóid published a complete translation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s 154 sonnets into Connacht Irish under the title &quot;Rotha Mór an Ghrá&quot; (&quot;The Great Wheel of Love&quot;).

In an article about his translations, Sionóid wrote that Irish poetic forms are completely different from those of other languages and that both the sonnet form and the iambic pentameter line had long been considered &quot;entirely unsuitable&quot; for composing poetry in Irish. In his translations, Soinóid chose to closely reproduce Shakespeare&#x27;s rhyme scheme and rhythms while rendering into Irish.

In a copy that he gifted to the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford Upon Avon, Sionóid wrote, &quot;From Slaneyside to Avonside, from a land of bards to the greatest Bard of all; and long life and happiness to the guardians of the world’s most precious treasure.&quot;

In 2013, Leabhar Breac published Máire Mhac an tSaoi&#x27;s literary translations of Rainer Maria Rilke&#x27;s &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; from the original German into the Munster Irish traditionally spoken in Dun Chaoin, County Kerry.

==Irish Poetry Reading Archive==
The newly created Irish Poetry Reading Archive (IPRA) is building into a comprehensive web-based library of Irish poets. Hosted by UCD’s Digital Library, a part of the university&#x27;s James Joyce Library, it has an archive of contemporary Irish poets. These include established and emerging poets in both the English and Irish languages, experimental and emigrant poets, as well as performance poets. It contains videos of poets reading their work, as well hand-written copies of the recorded poems, signed copies of their collections, and a growing collection of poets&#x27; archives.

<text>Leonard Nelson (; ; 11 July 1882 – 29 October 1927), sometimes spelt Leonhard, was a German mathematician, critical philosopher, and socialist. He was part of the neo-Friesian school (named after post-Kantian philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries) of neo-Kantianism and a friend of the mathematician David Hilbert. He devised the Grelling–Nelson paradox in 1908 and the related idea of autological words with Kurt Grelling.

Nelson subsequently became influential in both philosophy and mathematics, as his close contacts with scientists and mathematicians influenced their ideas. Despite dying earlier than many of his friends and assistants, his ISK organization lived on after his death, even after being banned by the Nazi Regime in 1933. It is even claimed that Albert Einstein supported it. He&#x27;s also credited with popularizing the Socratic method in his book &quot;Die sokratische Methode&quot; (&quot;The Socratic Method&quot;).

== Life ==
=== Early life and education ===
Leonard Nelson was the son of lawyer Heinrich Nelson (1854–1929) and artist Elisabeth Lejeune Dirichlet (1860–1920). His mother was the granddaughter of mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and descendant of Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. Nelson was baptised as a Protestant at the age of five on 13 June 1887.

Nelson studied at Französisches Gymnasium Berlin, where mathematics and science were not a focus of the curriculum. He was therefore privately tutored by mathematician Gerhard Hessenberg (1874–1925), and began reading the works of philosophers Immanuel Kant, Jakob Friedrich Fries, and Ernst Friedrich Apelts, which began to spark his interest in philosophy.

In 1901, Nelson studied mathematics and philosophy at Heidelberg University for a short period of time before going to Friedrich Wilhelm University (today: Humboldt-Universität) in Berlin, from March 1901 to 1903. From 1903 to 1904, he worked with mathematicians and philosophers at the University of Göttingen, such as his doctoral advisor Julius Baumann, David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Carl Runge, and his later rival Edmund Husserl.

Nelson&#x27;s work as a philosopher was most concerned with critical philosophy, attributed to Kant. It sets out to find a &quot;critique&quot; on science and metaphysics, similar to empiricism, as things can only be true based on the perceptions and limitations on human minds. Kant&#x27;s 1781 book &quot;Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft)&quot; inspired Nelson to go down the path of critical philosophy, and later followed the works of post-Kantian philosopher Fries who had also followed Kant&#x27;s work.

His first dissertation was &quot;Die kritische Methode und das Verhältnis der Psychologie zur Philosophie&quot; (&quot;The Critical Method and the Relationship of Psychology to Philosophy&quot;), which failed. His 1904 dissertation &quot;Jakob Fries and his Latest Critics&quot; (&quot;Jakob Friedrich Fries und seine jüngsten Kritiker&quot;) was successful. Nelson continued defending Fries&#x27; philosophy and ideas by publishing a &quot;neue Folge&quot; (new series) of &quot;Abhandlungen der Fries&#x27;schen Schule&quot; (1904) with Gerhard Hessenberg and mathematician Karl Kaiser. It was here that Nelson and these same friends created the &quot;Jakob-Friedrich-Fries-Gesellschaft&quot; (Jakob Friedrich Fries Society) to promote critical philosophy.

=== Career ===
Ready to form new ideas, Nelson founded the Neo-Friesian School in 1903, with some well-known members, such as Rudolf Otto, philosopher (1869–1937), Gerhard Hessenberg, mathematician (1874–1925) and Otto Meyerhof. biochemist (1884–1951). Other notable people, such as philosopher Kurt Grelling and mathematician Richard Courant (student of Hilbert), joined after its foundation. A larger list of ISK members and similar can be seen in the list of Germans who resisted Nazism.

In 1909 he habilitated at the University of Göttingen and became &quot;Privatdozent&quot;. From June 1919 until his death on 29 October 1927 he was a professor in Göttingen.

In 1922, Nelson founded the &quot;Philosophisch-Politische Akademie&quot; (Philosophical-Political Academy or PPA) as a &quot;Platonic Academy&quot; and non-profit association, which was abandoned soon after the Nazis banned it, but re-established in 1949. It still stands today for political discussions between philosophers and politicians, and was supported financially by the &quot;Gesellschaft der Freunde der Philosophisch-Politischen Akademie&quot; (Society of Friends of the Philosophical-Political Academy or GFA). They started working with an education center called &quot;Landerziehungsheim Walkemühle&quot;, founded in 1921 by a support of Nelson, progressive teacher Ludwig Wunder (1878–1949). Although Wunder left it shortly after in 1924, educator and co-worker of Nelson, Minna Specht, took over, with the help of journalist and author Mary Saran.

==== Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund (ISK) ====
In 1917 Nelson and Minna Specht founded the &quot;Internationaler Jugendbund&quot; (International Youth Federation or IJB). In 1918, Nelson briefly became a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD), and from 1923–1925 he was a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), until he was ultimately excluded. As a result, in 1925, he and Minna Specht founded the Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund &quot;(&quot;ISK; &quot;International Socialist Militant League&quot;) merging it with the IJB by taking over its publishing label, &quot;Öffentliches Leben&quot;. Among Leonard Nelson&#x27;s students and political companions in the International Socialist Kampfbund were also Prime Minister Alfred Kubel (1909–1999) and journalist Fritz Eberhard (1896–1982), later member of the Parlamentarischer Rat.

Nelson married Elisabeth Schemmann (1884–1954), in 1907, but divorced in 1912 after she baptised their son Gerhard David Wilhelm Nelson (1909–1944) in the Lutheran Church. Nelson&#x27;s refusal to baptise his son and divorce was a big change based on his Jewish ancestry. He even resigned from the Evangelical Church in 1919.

His wife married Paul Hensel in 1917.

Nelson was an early advocate of animal rights and a vegetarian. His lecture &quot;Duties to Animals&quot; was published posthumously in Germany in 1932 and included in his book &quot;A System of Ethics&quot; (translated in 1956) and reprinted in the 1972 book &quot;Animals, Men and Morals&quot;.
Nelson was an insomniac and died at a young age from pneumonia, and was buried at a Jewish cemetery in Melsungen alongside his father Heinrich.

==Posthumous legacy==
In the summer of 1997 his granddaughter, Maria Nelson, and Maria&#x27;s daughter, Rachel Urban, both visited his grave .

Nelson&#x27;s ideas continued to have an impact upon German socialism and communism in Nazi Germany as the ISK&#x27;s members became active in the left-wing resistance to Nazism.

== Bibliography ==
Nelson published numerous books and papers, often with the help of other philosophers and mathematicians. He was later critical of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in his work &quot;Progress and Regress in Philosophy&quot; (&quot;Fortschritte und Rückschritte der Philosophie&quot;). He is also known for defending the idea of animal rights in his work &quot;System of Philosophical Ethics and Pedagogy&quot; (&quot;System der philosophischen Ethik und Pädagogik&quot;) published in 1932, with the help of his assistant Grete Hermann (also part of the ISK) and Minna Specht.

Some of his works are already mentioned above, but some others, available in the Internet Archive (and other websites, if not available there), include:

<text>Stuart Allen Roosa (August 16, 1933 – December 12, 1994) was an American aeronautical engineer, smokejumper, United States Air Force pilot, test pilot, and NASA astronaut, who was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 14 mission. The mission lasted from January 31 to February 9, 1971, and was the third mission to land astronauts (Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell) on the Moon. While Shepard and Mitchell spent two days on the lunar surface, Roosa conducted experiments from orbit in the Command Module &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;. He was one of 24 men to travel to the Moon, which he orbited 34 times.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Roosa was born on August 16, 1933, in Durango, Colorado, to parents Dewey Roosa (1903–1988) and Lorine Roosa (; 1908–1993) and grew up in Claremore, Oklahoma. He attended Justus Grade School and Claremore High School in Claremore, Oklahoma, from which he graduated in 1951. Thereafter, he studied at Oklahoma State University and the University of Arizona, before graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering with honors from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1960.

===Military service===

Roosa began his career as a smokejumper with the U.S. Forest Service, dropping into at least four active fires in Oregon and California during the 1953 fire season. He was a graduate of the Aviation Cadet Program at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, where he received his flight training commission in the U.S. Air Force. He also attended the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class 64C) and was an experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California before being selected for the astronaut class of 1966.

From July 1962 to August 1964, Roosa was a maintenance flight test pilot at Olmstead Air Force Base, Pennsylvania, flying F-101 Voodoo aircraft. He was a fighter pilot at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, where he flew the F-84F Thunderstreak and F-100 Super Sabre aircraft. Following graduation from the University of Colorado, under the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology Program, he served as Chief of Service Engineering (AFLC) at Tachikawa Air Base, Japan, for two years.

===NASA career===
Roosa was one of 19 people selected as part of the astronaut class of 1966. He was the Capsule communicator (CAPCOM) at the Launch Complex 34 blockhouse during the Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967. In 1969, he served as a member of the astronaut support crew for the Apollo 9 mission.

On Apollo 14, he spent 33 hours in solo orbit around the Moon, conducting an extensive series of experiments. As part of a joint U.S. Forest Service/NASA project, he carried seeds from loblolly pine, sycamore, sweet gum, redwood, and Douglas fir trees. The seeds were germinated on his return and planted throughout the United States, becoming known as the &quot;Moon Trees&quot;.

Roosa later served as backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 16 and Apollo 17. Based on crew rotations, he would probably have commanded one of the last missions had they not been cancelled. He was assigned to the Space Shuttle program until his retirement as a colonel from the Air Force in 1976.

Roosa logged 5,500 hours of flying time; 5,000 hours in jet aircraft. He also logged 217 hours in space.

===Post-NASA career===
Roosa, who attended Harvard Business School&#x27;s six-week Advanced Management Program in 1973, later held a number of positions in international and U.S. businesses. He founded Gulf Coast Coors in 1981; he served as its president until his death.

===Death===

On December 12, 1994, Roosa died at age 61 in Washington, D.C., from complications of pancreatitis. He was survived by his wife Joan, three sons and a daughter, and seven grandchildren.

Roosa is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife Joan died on October 30, 2007, in Gulfport, Mississippi. She was interred at Arlington with her husband.

==Organizations==
Roosa&#x27;s memberships include the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, New York Safari Club, Board of Directors, People-to-People Sports Committee, Hunting Hall of Fame, Circumnavigators Club, Explorers Club, Commemorative Air Force, Shikar-Safari-Club and Gulfport Yacht Club.

==Awards and honors==
Roosa&#x27;s honors include the NASA Distinguished Service Medal; the MSC Superior Achievement Award (1970); the Air Force Command Pilot Astronaut Wings; the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal; the Arnold Air Society&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Award (1971); the City of New York Gold Medal (1971); the American Astronautical Society&#x27;s Flight Achievement Award (1971); the Order of Tehad (1973); and the Order of the Central African Empire (1973). Additionally, an elementary school in Claremore, Oklahoma is named in his honor. He received an honorary LL.D. from University of St. Thomas, Houston in 1971.

He was one of five Oklahoman astronauts inducted into the Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame in 1980 and he was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. Roosa was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997.

==In media==
* In the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1998), Roosa was played by George Newbern.
* The book &quot;Smoke Jumper, Moon Pilot&quot; (2011), by Willie G. Moseley, is a biography on Roosa&#x27;s life.
* In 2013, footage of Roosa&#x27;s son holding a photo of Roosa with two of his granddaughters appears in USAA insurance television ads promoting availability to family members.

<doc id="338129" wikidata="Q1972021" url="?curid=338129" title="Plateau's problem">
<text>In mathematics, Plateau&#x27;s problem is to show the existence of a minimal surface with a given boundary, a problem raised by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1760. However, it is named after Joseph Plateau who experimented with soap films. The problem is considered part of the calculus of variations. The existence and regularity problems are part of geometric measure theory.

==History==
Various specialized forms of the problem were solved, but it was only in 1930 that general solutions were found in the context of mappings (immersions) independently by Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó. Their methods were quite different; Radó&#x27;s work built on the previous work of René Garnier and held only for rectifiable simple closed curves, whereas Douglas used completely new ideas with his result holding for an arbitrary simple closed curve. Both relied on setting up minimization problems; Douglas minimized the now-named Douglas integral while Radó minimized the &quot;energy&quot;. Douglas went on to be awarded the Fields Medal in 1936 for his efforts.

==In higher dimensions==
The extension of the problem to higher dimensions (that is, for formula_1-dimensional surfaces in formula_2-dimensional space) turns out to be much more difficult to study. Moreover, while the solutions to the original problem are always regular, it turns out that the solutions to the extended problem may have singularities if formula_3. In the hypersurface case where formula_4, singularities occur only for formula_5. An example of such singular solution of the Plateau problem is the Simons cone, a cone over formula_6 in formula_7 that was first described by Jim Simons and was shown to be an area minimizer by Bombieri, De Giorgi and Giusti. To solve the extended problem in certain special cases, the theory of perimeters (De Giorgi) for codimension 1 and the theory of rectifiable currents (Federer and Fleming) for higher codimension have been developed. The theory guarantees existence of codimension 1 solutions that are smooth away from a closed set of Hausdorff dimension formula_8. In the case of higher codimension Almgren proved existence of solutions with singular set of dimension at most formula_9 in his regularity theorem. S. X. Chang, a
student of Almgren, built upon Almgren’s work to show that the singularities of 2-dimensional area
minimizing integral currents (in arbitrary codimension) form a finite discrete set.

The axiomatic approach of Jenny Harrison and Harrison Pugh treats a wide variety of special cases. In particular, they solve the anisotropic Plateau problem in arbitrary dimension and codimension for any collection of rectifiable sets satisfying a combination of general homological, cohomological or homotopical spanning conditions. A different proof of Harrison-Pugh&#x27;s results were obtained by Camillo De Lellis, Francesco Ghiraldin and Francesco Maggi.

==Physical applications==
Physical soap films are more accurately modeled by the formula_10-minimal sets of Frederick Almgren, but the lack of a compactness theorem makes it difficult to prove the existence of an area minimizer. In this context, a persistent open question has been the existence of a least-area soap film. Ernst Robert Reifenberg solved such a &quot;universal Plateau&#x27;s problem&quot; for boundaries which are homeomorphic to single embedded spheres.

<doc id="338134" wikidata="Q11712" url="?curid=338134" title="Tube-dwelling spider">
<text>Tube-dwelling spiders (Segestriidae) are a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Eugène Simon in 1893. It consists of five genera, two large and widespread, &quot;Segestria&quot; and &quot;Ariadna&quot;, and three smaller genera, &quot;Citharoceps&quot;, &quot;Gippsicola&quot; and &quot;Indoseges&quot;. They are haplogyne spiders, related to the Dysderidae and placed in clade or superfamily Dysderoidea.

Members of this family are easily recognized because their first three pairs of legs are arranged forward instead of two and they have six eyes instead of eight, arranged in a semicircle. The leg structure appears to be an adaptation for living in silken tubes. Unlike those of the atypical tarantulas, these tubes may branch and are often built in tree bark fissures, as well as under stones.

Both &quot;Segestria&quot; and &quot;Ariadna&quot; live in North America, South America, Eurasia, Africa and New Zealand, though &quot;Ariadna&quot; also lives in Australia.

==Genera==
, the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:
* &quot;Ariadna&quot; —South America, Europe, North America, Oceania, Africa, Asia, Central America, Dominican Republic
* &quot;Citharoceps&quot; —United States, Mexico
* &quot;Gippsicola&quot; —Australia
* &quot;Indoseges&quot; —India
* &quot;Segestria&quot; —Asia, North America, Europe, South America, Africa, New Zealand
The oldest unambiguous members of the family are known from the Eocene Baltic amber. Cretaceous taxa &quot;Denticulsegestria&quot;, &quot;Jordansegestria&quot;, &quot;Jordariadna&quot;, &quot;Lebansegestria&quot;, &quot;Microsegestria&quot;, &quot;Myansegestria&quot;, &quot;Palaeosegestria&quot; and &quot;Parvosegestria&quot;, originally described as tube-dwelling spiders, might be members of the stem group of Segestriidae or stem dysderoids instead.

<doc id="338135" wikidata="Q5050916" url="?curid=338135" title="Casualty Actuarial Society">
<text>The Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) is a leading international professional society of actuaries, based in North America, and specializing in property and casualty insurance.

The two levels of CAS membership are Associate (ACAS) and Fellow (FCAS). Requirements for these levels of membership include a comprehensive series of exams. Topics covered in the exams include statistics, mathematics, finance, economics, insurance, enterprise risk management, and actuarial science. Another class of CAS membership, Affiliate, includes qualified actuaries who practice in property-casualty insurance but do not meet the qualifications to become an Associate or Fellow.

==History==
The society was founded in 1914 and originally named the Casualty Actuarial and Statistical Society. The present name was adopted in 1921. The society&#x27;s first president was I. M. Rubinow, who played a key role in its formation. There were 97 founding members of the society.

The CAS was at first primarily concerned with problems of workers compensation insurance, which was introduced in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Eventually members of the society worked on all types of property-casualty insurance, including coverages for automobiles, homes and businesses. , the society has over 10,000 members. Although the majority of members live and practice in the United States, there are CAS members in more than 25 countries around the world.

Members of the CAS are employed by insurance companies, reinsurance companies, insurance brokers, educational institutions, ratemaking organizations, state insurance departments, the federal government, independent consulting firms, and non-traditional employers. There are a number of regional affiliates of the CAS, along with several special interest sections. , there are 6,676 Fellows, 3,340 Associates, and 33 Affiliate members of CAS.

== Education system ==
The CAS requires all candidates to qualify through a series of actuarial exams covering various aspects of actuarial practice. Passing Exams 1–6 as well as Exam S, the Course on Professionalism, the Validation by Educational Experience (VEE), and two online courses qualifies an actuary for the Associateship designation; passing three additional exams is required to become a Fellow. The exams usually take a long time to complete, often near a decade, due to the low pass rates and the difficulty of the syllabus material.

A number of the earlier exams are conducted jointly with the Society of Actuaries (SOA), and relatively few actuaries have qualified as members of both the CAS and the SOA.

The subject matter covered in the VEE and each of the nine other CAS components is as follows:

=== Preliminary exams ===
The first four actuarial exam requirements, known as &quot;Preliminary Exams&quot; consist largely of core mathematics related to actuarial science including probability, statistics, interest theory, and risk models. Exams 1 and 2 (known to the SOA as Exams P and FM) are common to both the SOA and the CAS. This joint sponsorship allows students to work on some of the initial requirements before they choose a specific discipline to pursue. The syllabus has a tendency to be adjusted regularly, which makes comparing exams from different 5-year blocks somewhat difficult.

=== Other components toward associateship ===
In addition to preliminary exams, the candidate need to complete the Validation by Educational Experience (VEE) and Data Insurance Series Courses to achieve the credential of Associate of Casualty Actuarial Society (ACAS).

=== Fellowship exams ===
Three additional exams are required to achieve the credential of Fellow of Casualty Actuarial Society (FCAS).
==Publications and research==
The society&#x27;s members publish a large number of research papers on various aspects of property-casualty actuarial science. The society&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious research publication was the annual &quot;Proceedings of the Casualty Actuarial Society&quot; which was published from 1914–2005. In 2006 the &quot;Proceedings&quot; no longer contained research papers but only administrative material in combination with the Society&#x27;s &quot;Yearbook&quot;. Peer-reviewed research is now published in &quot;Variance&quot; which focuses on both practical and theoretical research in non-life actuarial science and related areas in the science of risk. Variance&#x27;s current lead editors are Dr. Peng Shi (University of Wisconsin–Madison) and Avraham Adler. Non-peer reviewed research is published in the CAS &quot;E-Forum&quot;. The society also publishes various research reports which are used throughout the insurance industry such as ones on Disruptive Technologies and bias.

==Meetings and administrative structure==
The society holds two general meetings each year for the presentation of research papers and discussions about actuarial topics. Several other meetings, specializing in topics such as ratemaking, predictive modeling, loss reserving, or reinsurance are offered each year, along with a series of limited attendance seminars. Each of the regional affiliates also holds regular meetings.

Many members of the CAS are also members of the American Academy of Actuaries, the U.S. umbrella group for actuaries of all specialties. 

The governing body of the society is the 15-member board of directors, elected by members who hold the Fellowship designation. The administration of the society is conducted by a President elected by the Fellows and seven board-elected Vice-Presidents responsible for administration, admissions, international activities, marketing and communications, professional education, research and development, and risk integration and enterprise risk management. These elected officials oversee a large number of task forces and committees composed of society members and others. The largest single committee is the Examination Committee, consisting of more than three hundred society members, who are responsible for writing and grading the CAS actuarial exams. 

==Controversies==

===Rescinding of CAS Statements of Principles===
In December 2020, the CAS Board of Directors voted unanimously to rescind three CAS Statements of Principles. This action by the CAS Board caused a prompt backlash from CAS stakeholders for whom this presented significant problems, including CAS Members, regulatory agencies, and consumer groups. In response, the CAS Board voted to reinstate the Ratemaking Statement of Principles in May 2021.

<doc id="338147" wikidata="Q1857731" url="?curid=338147" title="Historic counties of Wales">
<text>The historic counties of Wales () were the thirteen sub-divisions used in Wales from either 1282 and 1535, up to their abolition in 1974, being replaced by eight counties. They were used for various functions for several hundred years, but for administrative purposes have been superseded by contemporary sub-national divisions, some of which bear some limited similarity to the historic entities in name and extent. They are alternatively known as &quot;ancient counties&quot;.

==The counties==

:1 The earldom of Pembroke and lordship of Glamorgan pre-date the Edwardian conquest.
:2 These counties originate in 1282, following King Edward I&#x27;s conquest.
:3 These counties originate in 1535, with the Laws in Wales Act, 1535, converting the remaining Marcher Lordships into counties.
:4 Despite being created at the same Act as the other counties, Monmouthshire was included with English counties for legal purposes until 1974. Between 1536 and 1974 the formulation &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot; was frequently used.
The 1535 Laws in Wales Act had the effect of abolishing the marcher lordships within and on the borders of Wales. In the border areas, several were incorporated in whole or in part into English counties. The lordships of Ludlow, Clun, Caus and part of Montgomery were incorporated into Shropshire; and Wigmore, Huntington, Clifford and most of Ewyas were included in Herefordshire.

The historic counties established by 1535 were used as the geographical basis for the administrative counties, governed by county councils, which existed from 1889 to 1974. The historian William Rees said, in his &quot;Historical Atlas of Wales&quot;: (published 1959)
&quot;... the boundaries of the modern shires have largely been determined by the ancient divisions of the country. The survival of these ancient local divisions within the pattern of historical change constitutes a vital element in the framework of the national life and helps to preserve its continuity.&quot;

==Four circuits of Wales==
In the 1536 acts of the Union, a Court of Great Sessions in Wales was created in Wales for four separate circuits. The circuits each had 3 counties involved. Some of the original territorial Marcher lordships were split into regional circuits and others were created from regions of the former Principality of Wales:

*Anglesey, Caernarfon &amp; Merioneth
*Flint, Denbigh &amp; Montgomery
*Cardigan, Carmarthen &amp; Pembroke
*Radnor, Brecon &amp; Glamorgan

==Exclaves==
The Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 abolished several enclaves. One of these, Welsh Bicknor (Llangystennin) was an exclave of Monmouthshire between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire and was transferred to Herefordshire. Two townships of the ancient parish of Cwmyoy were also exclaves of Herefordshire. Bwlch Trewyn was transferred to Monmouthshire, whereas the other, Ffwddog (identified using the English variant Fothock on older maps), was not.

The Herefordshire township of Litton and Cascob (in the parishes of Cascob and Presteigne), was transferred to Radnorshire.

The Denbighshire township of Carreghofa (in the parish of Llanymynech) was transferred to Montgomeryshire.

The exclaves of Flintshire, called English Maelor and Marford and Hoseley were left untouched.

==Monmouthshire==

The territory which became Monmouthshire was part of the Welsh kingdoms of Gwent and Glywysing and later, after the Norman conquest of southern Wales, of the Welsh Marches. Although the original Laws in Wales Act 1535 specifically stated the lands making up Monmouthshire were from the &#x27;Country or Dominion of Wales&#x27;, the Laws in Wales Act 1542 added Monmouthshire to the Oxford circuit of the English assizes rather than falling under the Court of Great Sessions in Wales. According to historian John Davies, this arrangement was the cause of the erroneous belief that the county had been annexed by England rather than remaining part of Wales. In later centuries, some English historians, map-makers, landowners and politicians took the view that Monmouthshire was an English rather than a Welsh county, and references were often made in legislation to &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;. The position was finally resolved by the Local Government Act 1972, which confirmed Monmouthshire&#x27;s place within Wales.

==Local government==

===1889===
The Local Government Act 1888 created a parallel system of administrative counties based on the historic counties in 1889. Additionally, certain boroughs were deemed to be county boroughs, outside the administrative counties (Cardiff and Swansea in 1889, Newport in 1891 and Merthyr Tydfil in 1908). As a result of 85 years of local government boundary changes, the boundaries of the administrative counties became increasingly different from the historic counties, until they were abandoned altogether for a different system of local government in 1974.

===1974===
The Local Government Act 1972 replaced the administrative counties created in 1889 with eight new administrative counties in 1974. The existing Lieutenancy areas were also redefined to use the newly created local government areas, defined by the act as &quot;counties&quot;. Furthermore, use of the historic counties as postal counties was stopped by the Royal Mail in 1975 and those historic counties were no longer shown on maps. However, in spite of widespread misunderstanding, the Local Government Act 1972 never abolished the historic counties. Indeed, the Department of the Environment made this very clear in a statement it issued on 1 April 1974:

The eight new administrative counties were themselves replaced in 1996 by the current principal areas of Wales, but modified versions were retained for Lieutenancy as the preserved counties.

==Vice counties==
The vice counties, used for biological recording throughout Great Britain and Ireland since 1852, are largely based on historic county boundaries. They ignore all exclaves and are modified by subdividing large counties and merging smaller areas into neighbouring counties. The static boundaries make longitudinal study of biodiversity easier.

==Index of Place Names==
The historic counties of Wales are included in the Index of Place Names (IPN) published by the Office for National Statistics. Each &quot;place&quot; included in the IPN is related to the historic county it lies within, as well as to a set of administrative areas. The Historic Counties Trust has published demographic statistics for the historic counties of the UK from the 2011 United Kingdom census including a comparison of population and population density in the historic counties of England and Wales between the 1901 United Kingdom census and the 2011 United Kingdom census and a comparison of the number of Welsh speakers in the historic counties of Wales between the 1911 United Kingdom census and the 2011 United Kingdom census.

<text>The 3rd &quot;Alexandroni&quot; Brigade (, &quot;Hativat Aleksandroni&quot;) is an Israel Defense Forces brigade which has fought in many of Israel&#x27;s wars.

== Organization ==

* 3rd Infantry Brigade &quot;Alexandroni&quot; (Reserve)
** 7012th Infantry Battalion 
** 8101st Infantry Battalion 
** 9203rd Infantry Battalion
** (6609th) Reconnaissance Battalion &quot;Alexandroni&quot;
** 5280th Combat Engineer Battalion 
** Logistic Battalion
** Signal Company
==Role in Tantura massacre==
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, around 40–200 Palestinian Arab villagers from Tantura were killed in a massacre perpetrated by the Alexandroni Brigade, which at the time was one of six field forces of the Haganah. The massacre, which took place on the night of 22–23 May 1948, occurred following the surrender of Tantura, a village of roughly 1,500 people in 1945 located near Haifa. The bodies of the victims were buried in mass graves, one of which was later covered and a carpark constructed above it.

In 1998, an Israeli researcher Teddy Katz interviewed and taped Israeli and Palestinian witnesses to events at Tantura in 1948 and wrote a master&#x27;s thesis at Haifa University claiming that Israeli units committed a massacre of Palestinians at Tantura. The veterans of the brigade sued Katz for libel. Katz was forced to retract his conclusion and to apologize. 

In 2023, an Israeli documentary was published on the Tantura massacre, which interviewed and filmed Katz, as well as several veterans, who agreed to talk about the events. The movie was harshly criticized by the historian Benny Morris, who characterized the documentary as &quot;basically fraudulent&quot;.

<doc id="338154" wikidata="Q184753" url="?curid=338154" title="Wound">
<text>A wound is any disruption of or damage to living tissue, such as skin, mucous membranes, or organs. Wounds can either be the sudden result of direct trauma (mechanical, thermal, chemical), or can develop slowly over time due to underlying disease processes such as diabetes mellitus, venous/arterial insufficiency, or immunologic disease. Wounds can vary greatly in their appearance depending on wound location, injury mechanism, depth of injury, timing of onset (acute vs chronic), and wound sterility, among other factors. Treatment strategies for wounds will vary based on the classification of the wound, therefore it is essential that wounds be thoroughly evaluated by a healthcare professional for proper management. In normal physiology, all wounds will undergo a series of steps collectively known as the wound healing process, which include hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Age, tissue oxygenation, stress, underlying medical conditions, and certain medications are just a few of the many factors known to affect the rate of wound healing.

==Classification==
Wounds can be broadly classified as either acute or chronic based on time from initial injury and progression through normal stages of wound healing. Both wound types can further be categorized by cause of injury, wound severity/depth, and sterility of the wound bed. Several classification systems have been developed to describe wounds and guide their management. Some notable classification systems include the CDC&#x27;s Surgical Wound Classification, the International Red Cross Wound Classification, the Tscherne classification, the Gustilo-Anderson classification of open fractures, and the AO soft tissue grading system.

=== Acute wounds ===
An acute wound is any wound which results from direct trauma and progresses through the four stages of wound healing along an expected timeline. The first stage, hemostasis, lasts from minutes to hours after initial injury. This stage is followed by the inflammatory phase which typically lasts 1 to 3 days. Proliferation is the third stage of wound healing and lasts from a few days up to a month. The fourth and final phase of wound healing, remodeling/scar formation, typically lasts 12 months but can continue as long as 2 years after the initial injury. Acute wounds can further be classified as either open or closed. An open wound is any injury whereby the integrity of the skin has been disrupted and the underlying tissue is exposed. A closed wound, on the other hand, is any injury in which underlying tissue has been damaged but the overlying skin is still intact.

==== Open wounds ====
* Incisions or incised wounds – caused by a clean, sharp-edged object such as a knife, razor, or glass splinter.
* – irregular tear-like wounds caused by some blunt trauma. Lacerations and incisions may appear linear (regular) or stellate (irregular). The term &quot;laceration&quot; is commonly misused in reference to incisions.
* Abrasions (grazes) – superficial wounds in which the topmost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is scraped off. Abrasions are often caused by a sliding fall onto a rough surface such as asphalt, tree bark or concrete.
* Avulsions – injuries in which a body structure is forcibly detached from its normal point of insertion; a type of amputation where the extremity is pulled off rather than cut off. When used in reference to skin avulsions, the term &#x27;degloving&#x27; is also sometimes used as a synonym.
* Puncture wounds – caused by an object puncturing the skin, such as a splinter, nail, knife or sharp tooth.
* Penetration wounds – caused by an object such as a knife entering and coming out from the skin.
* Gunshot wounds – caused by a bullet or similar projectile driving into or through the body. There may be two wounds, one at the site of entry and one at the site of exit, generally referred to as a &quot;through-and-through.&quot;
*Critical wounds – Including large burns that have been split. These wounds can cause serious hydroelectrolytic and metabolic alterations including fluid loss, electrolyte imbalances, and increased catabolism.

==== Closed wounds ====
* Hematomas (or blood tumor) – caused by damage to a blood vessel that in turn causes blood to collect under the skin.
** Hematomas that originate from internal blood vessel pathology are petechiae, purpura, and ecchymosis. The different classifications are based on size.
** Hematomas that originate from an external source of trauma are contusions, also commonly called bruises.
* Crush injury – caused by a great or extreme amount of force applied over a long period of time.

==== Fractures ====
Fractures can be classified as either open or closed, depending on whether the integrity of the overlying skin has been disrupted or preserved, respectively. Several classification systems have been developed to further characterize soft tissue injuries in the setting of an underlying fracture:

* Tscherne classification – Used to describe external appearance of wounds in both open and closed fractures.
* Gustilo-Anderson classification – Classifies open fractures based on wound size, extent of soft tissue loss, and degree of contamination.
* Hannover Fracture scale – Used in open fractures as an extremity salvage assessment.
* AO Classification – adapted from the Tscherne classification, provides separate grading system for skin, muscles/tendons, and neurovascular structures.

=== Chronic wounds ===
Any wound which is arrested or delayed during any of the normal stages of wound healing is considered to be a chronic wound. Most commonly, these are wounds which develop due to an underlying disease process such as diabetes mellitus or arterial/venous insufficiency. However, it is important to note that any acute wound has the potential to become a chronic wound if any of the normal stages of wound healing are interrupted. Chronic wounds are most commonly a result of disruption of the inflammatory phase of wound healing, however errors in any phase can result in a chronic wound. The exact duration of time which distinguishes a chronic wound from an acute wound is not clearly defined, although many clinicians agree that wounds which have not progressed for over three months are considered chronic wounds.

==== Common causes of chronic wounds ====

* Diabetes mellitus – Wound healing impairment in the setting of diabetes is multifactorial. Hyperglycemia, neuropathy, microvascular complications, impaired immune and inflammatory responses, and psychological factors have all been implicated in the formation and propagation of diabetic wounds. Feet are the most common location of diabetic wounds, although any type of wound can be negatively impacted by diabetes. It has been estimated that up to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will be affected by non-healing wounds in their lifetime.
* Venous/Arterial insufficiency – Impaired blood outflow (venous) or inflow (arterial) can both impair wound healing, thereby causing chronic wounds. Much like diabetes, venous/arterial insufficiency most commonly result in chronic wounds of the lower extremities. In chronic venous insufficiency, blood pooling impedes oxygen exchange and creates a chronic pro-inflammatory environment which both promote formation of venous ulcers. Peripheral artery disease, on the other hand, causes wounds due to poor blood inflow and typically affects the most distal extremities (fingers, toes).
* Immunologic disease – The immune system plays a critical role in the inflammatory process; therefore, any disease of the immune system has the potential to impair the inflammatory phase of wound healing, thereby leading to a chronic wound. Patients suffering from diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have been found to have larger wounds and prolonged time to heal when compared to the general population.
* Pressure ulcer – Also known as decubitus ulcers or bedsores, this type of wound is a result of chronic pressure to the skin over a prolonged period. While most individuals have intact sensation and motor function which allow for frequent positional change to prevent the formation of such ulcers, older individuals are particularly susceptible to this type of chronic injury due to impaired neurosensory responses. Pressure ulcers can occur in as little as two hours of immobility in a bedridden patient or person who is otherwise unconscious/sedated (surgery, syncope, etc.). In the United States, pressure ulcers are graded using the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) system. In this system, ulcers are graded on wound depth with stage 1 being the least severe (erythema, intact skin) and stage 4 being full thickness damage through subcutaneous tissue down to muscle, tendon, or bone. Any ulcer that cannot be assessed due to overlying eschar is considered unstageable.

=== Wound sterility ===
Wound sterility, or degree of contamination of a wound, is a critical consideration when evaluating a wound. In the United States, the CDC&#x27;s Surgical Wound Classification System is most commonly used for classification of a wound&#x27;s sterility, specifically within a surgical setting. According to this classification system, four different classes of wound exist, each with their own postoperative risk of surgical site infection:

* Class 1 – clean wound: a wound that is not infected and without signs of inflammation. This type of wound is typically closed. By definition, this type of wound excludes any wounds of the respiratory, genital, alimentary, or urinary tract.
* Class 2 – clean-contaminated wound: a wound with a low level of contamination. May involve entry into the respiratory, genital, alimentary, or urinary tract.
* Class 3 – contaminated wound: an open, accidental wound resulting from trauma outside of a sterile setting is automatically considered a contaminated wound. Additionally, any surgical wound where there is a major break in sterile technique or obvious contamination from the gastrointestinal tract is considered a contaminated wound.
* Class 4 – dirty/infected: a wound with evidence of an existing clinical infection. Class 4 wounds are usually found in old traumatic wounds which were not adequately treated and will show evidence of devitalized tissue or gross purulence.

==Presentation==

=== Workup ===
==== Physical examination ====
Wound presentation will vary greatly based on a number of factors, each of which is important to consider in order to establish a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In addition to collecting a thorough history, the following factors should be considered when evaluating any wound:

* Size of wound: Should be accurately measured at time of initial presentation and regularly remeasured until wound resolution.
* Wound location: Very useful consideration in many chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous ulcers. Acute wounds will be located in areas consistent with the mechanism of injury (e.g. diagonal chest wall bruising from seatbelt following car accident).
* Wound bed: A healthy wound bed will appear pink due to healthy granulation tissue. Presence of a dark red wound bed which bleeds easily on contact or excess granulation tissue (i.e. hypergranulation tissue) may indicate the presence of an infection or non-healing wound.
* Wound depth: The depth of a wound is often not apparent on visual inspection alone. Proper evaluation of wound depth includes use of a probe to measure wound depth and evaluate for undermining of wound edges or sinus/fistula formation.
* Necrotic tissue, slough, eschar: Wounds may be covered with a layer of dead tissue which may appear cream/yellow in color (slough) or as a black, hardened tissue (eschar). Removing this tissue is critical for properly evaluating both the depth of a wound and quality of the wound bed, and promotes wound healing.
* Wound edges: May provide clues to cause of specific wounds, such as gently sloping edges of venous ulcers or rolled edges of certain tumors.
* Surrounding skin: Appearance of the surrounding skin can provide clues to underlying disease processes, such as redness/erythema due to cellulitis, maceration due to uncontrolled wound exudate, or eczematous changes due to a chronic irritation (e.g. allergic reaction to wound dressing).
* Infection: Classic signs of infection are redness, warmth, swelling, odor, and pain out of proportion to wound appearance.
* Pain: Pain can be nociceptive, neuropathic, or inflammatory, each of which can provide clues to the cause of a wound. Proper pain control is an important consideration in wound management, particularly in burn care where analgesia is often necessary prior to dressing changes.

A thorough wound evaluation, particularly evaluation of wound depth and removal of necrotic tissue, should be performed only by a licensed healthcare professional in order to avoid damage to nearby structures, infection, or worsening pain.

==== Diagnostics ====
Additional diagnostic tests may be needed during wound evaluation based on the cause, appearance, and age of a wound.

* Wound culture: If there is concern for infection, a wound can be more carefully evaluated for presence of bacteria via surface swabs, deep tissue biopsy, or needle biopsy. Surface swabs are most commonly used due to low cost, ease of use, and minimal pain to patient. Although swab cultures have been shown to reliably identify the organisms causing an infection, swabs are only able to identify bacteria on the surface of a wound and can occasionally be contaminated by normal skin flora. Deep tissue biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing wound infections due to being both more accurate and precise than swabs, however it is more invasive, more painful, and less cost effective than swabs and therefore is not the first choice for collecting wound cultures. Needle aspiration can only be implemented in wounds with underlying abscesses or fluid collections.
* Imaging: X-ray is useful to assess for an underlying fracture which may not be apparent on physical examination alone. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can all be used to assess for identifying fluid collections, necrotic tissue, or inflammation. Ultrasound is portable, low cost, quickly implemented, and does not expose patients to radiation, but is limited in diagnostic capabilities. CT is another quickly implemented option which generally provides more diagnostic information compared to ultrasound, however it is less cost-effective and exposes patients to radiation. MRI offers the greatest image resolution and can provide diagnostic information on presence of soft tissue infection or bone infection. Like ultrasound, MRI does not expose patients to radiation, however it is the slowest and most difficult to implement of the all of these imaging methods.
* Laboratory studies: Serum prealbumin levels may be useful in evaluating nutrition status in patients with chronic wounds or at risk for developing chronic wounds. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) can confirm presence of an infection but alone are not diagnostic. Routine bloodwork such as a basic metabolic panel (BMP) or complete blood count (CBC) are not typically required but may be useful in select circumstances.
* Ankle-brachial index/toe-brachial index (ABI/TBI): These tests can be used to assess blood supply to the lower extremities and their results may affect management of lower extremity wounds such as venous/arterial ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, or pressure ulcers.

==Management==

The goal of wound care is to promote an environment that allows a wound to heal as quickly as possible, with emphasis on restoring both form and function of the wounded area. Although optimal treatment strategies vary greatly depending on the specific cause, size, and age of a particular wound, there are universal principles of wound management that apply to all wounds. After a thorough evaluation is performed, all wounds should be properly irrigated and debrided. Proper cleansing of a wound is critical to prevent infection and promote re-epithelialization. Further efforts should be made to eliminate/limit any contributing factors to the wound (e.g. diabetes, pressure, etc.) and optimize the wound&#x27;s healing ability (i.e. optimize nutritional status). The end goal of wound management is closure of the wound which can be achieved by primary closure, delayed primary closure, or healing by secondary intention, each of which is discussed below. Pain control is a mainstay of wound management, as wound evaluation, wound cleansing, and dressing changes can be a painful process.

===Irrigation===
Proper cleansing of a wound is critical in preventing infection and promoting healing of any wound. Irrigation is defined as constant flow of a solution over the surface of a wound. The goal of irrigation is not only to remove debris and potential contaminants from a wound, but also to assist in visual inspection of a wound and hydrate the wound. Irrigation is typically achieved with either a bulb or syringe and needle/catheter. The preferred solution for irrigation is normal saline which is readily accessible in the emergency department, although recent studies have shown no difference in emergency department infection rates when comparing normal saline to potable tap water. Irrigation can also be achieved with a diluted 1% povidone iodine solution, but studies have again shown no difference in infection rates when compared to normal saline. Irrigation with antiseptic solutions, such as non-diluted povidone iodine, chlorhexidine, and hydrogen peroxide is not preferred since these solutions are toxic to tissue and inhibit wound healing. The exact volume of irrigation used will vary depending on the appearance of the wound, although some sources have reported 50–100 mL of irrigation per 1 cm of wound length as a guideline.

=== Debridement ===
Debridement is defined as removal of devitalized or dead tissue, particularly necrotic tissue, eschar, or slough. Debridement is a critical aspect of wound care because devitalized tissue, particularly necrotic tissue, serves as nutrients for bacteria thereby promoting infection. Additionally, devitalized tissue creates a physical barrier over a wound which limits the effectiveness of any applied topical compounds and prevents re-epithelialization. Lastly, devitalized tissue, especially eschar, prevents accurate assessment of underlying tissue, making appropriate assessment of a wound impossible without adequate debridement. Debridement can be achieved in several ways:

* Autolytic debridement: The most conservative type of debridement whereby the body&#x27;s own natural defenses break down necrotic tissue via phagocytes and proteolytic enzymes. This method requires a moist environment and intact immune system.
* Mechanical debridement: Achieved through use of mechanical force to remove devitalized tissue (e.g. wet-to-dry dressing, pressurized wound irrigation, pulse-lavage); however, this process will remove both healthy and non-healthy tissue and is therefore considered a non-selective debridement method.
* Enzymatic debridement: A process of debridement in which enzymes such as proteinases or collagenases are applied topically to digest devitalized tissue. Depending on the agent, this process can be either selective or non-selective. Examples include trypsin, streptokinase-streptodornase combination, subtilisin, papain, and collagenase.
* Surgical debridement: Also known as sharp debridement, this is a process in which devitalized tissue is removed through use of surgical instruments such as scalpels, curettes, or surgical scissors. Surgical debridement can be done in a hospital bed, in an outpatient clinic, or in an operating room depending on the particular wound, risk of bleeding, and anesthesia requirements.  
* Biological debridement: Also known as larval therapy, biological debridement is done through controlled application of sterile larvae (&quot;Lucilia sericata&quot;) to the wound bed. These larvae release proteolytic enzymes which dissolve necrotic tissue before then ingesting the now debrided tissue. Biologic debridement has the added benefit of being bactericidal since larvae will ingest bacteria as well as devitalized tissue. Despite the safety and effectiveness of this method, its applications are often limited due to patient&#x27;s negative feelings towards larvae which are commonly associated with poor hygiene and perishable food.

=== Closure ===

The end goal of wound care is to re-establish the integrity of the skin, a structure which serves as a barrier to the external environment. The preferred method of closure is to reattach/reapproximate the wound edges together, a process known as primary closure/healing by primary intention. Wounds that have not been closed within several hours of the initial injury or wounds that are concerning for infection will often be left open and treated with dressings for several days before being closed 3–5 days later, a process known as delayed primary closure. The exact duration of time from initial injury in which delayed primary closure is preferred over primary closure is not clearly defined. Wounds that cannot be closed primarily due to substantial tissue loss can be healed by secondary intention, a process in which the wound is allowed to fill-in over time through natural physiologic processes. When healing by secondary intention, granulation tissue grows in from the wound edges slowly over time to restore integrity of the skin. Healing by secondary intention can take up to months, requires daily wound care, and leaves an unfavorable scar, thus primary closure is always preferred when possible. As an alternative, wounds that cannot be closed primarily can be addressed with skin grafting or flap reconstruction, typically done by a plastic surgeon. There are several methods that can be implemented to achieve primary closure of a wound, including suture, staples, skin adhesive, and surgical strips. Suture is the most frequently used for closure. There are many types of suture, but broadly they can be categorized as absorbable vs non-absorbable and synthetic vs natural. Absorbable sutures have the added benefit of not requiring removal and are often preferred in children for this reason. Staples are less time-consuming and more cost effective than suture but have a risk of worse scarring if left in place for too long. Adhesive glue and sutures have comparable cosmetic outcomes for minor lacerations &lt;5 cm in adults and children. The use of adhesive glue involves considerably less time for the doctor and less pain for the person. The wound opens at a slightly higher rate but there is less redness. The risk for infections (1.1%) is the same for both. Adhesive glue should not be used in areas of high tension or repetitive movements, such as joints or the posterior trunk.

===Dressings===
After a wound is irrigated, debrided, and, if possible, closed, it should be dressed appropriately. The goals of a wound dressing are to act as a barrier to the outside environment, facilitate wound healing, promote hemostasis, and act as a form of mechanical debridement during dressing changes. The ideal wound dressing maintains a moist environment to optimize wound healing but is also capable of absorbing excess fluid as to avoid skin maceration or bacterial growth. Several wound dressing options are available, each tailored to different kinds of wounds:

* Gauze: Composed of woven or non-woven cotton, rayon, and polyester, gauze is highly absorbent, but removal can be uncomfortable.
* Films: Films are made of translucent polyurethane which is adherent to skin and semi-occlusive, allowing them to retain within the dressing but also allow for exchange of gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. The translucent nature of this dressing makes monitoring wounds simple.
* Hydrocolloids: Consist of an outer, water-impermeable layer and an inner layer made of colloid. When the inner colloid layer comes in contact with liquid, it becomes a gel allowing the dressing to maintain a moist environment while simultaneously absorbing exudate. Hydrocolloids cause minimal pain on removal but are at increased risk of skin maceration and bacterial growth.
* Hydrogels: An insoluble, hydrophilic material with soothing properties which is useful in treating burn wounds, dry chronic wounds, and pressure ulcers. Like hydrocolloids, hydrogels are capable of retaining excess moisture leading to skin maceration and bacterial growth.
* Foams: A flexible material with a hydrophobic outer layer that shields liquid from the outside environment, while having a highly absorptive inner layer which is ideal for highly exuding wounds. Foams should not be used in dryer wounds that require exudate to stay moist.
* Alginates: Derived from seaweed, alginates can absorb up to 15–20 times their weight in liquid and are ideal for highly exudative wounds. Like hydrocolloids, alginates form a gel when they come in contact with fluid, making removal relatively painless.
* Hydrofibers: A derivative of hydrocolloid dressings, hydrofibers are able to absorb up to 25 times their weight in fluid, making them the most absorbent dressing. They are much like alginate dressings in their absorptive capacity and tendency to form a gel upon contact with liquid.
* Medicated dressings: Many dressings come impregnated with medication, typically antimicrobial agents or debriding chemicals. Silver, iodine, growth hormones, enzymes, and antibacterial agents are most common.
* Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT): A unique type of dressing which consists of a foam dressing surrounded with an airtight film and then connected to power-assisted vacuum suction, creating a negative pressure environment over the wound. This negative pressure environment is thought to promote formation of granulation tissue and decrease inflammatory fluid. NPWT has the added benefit of requiring less frequent dressing changes, a process that is often painful for patients. Since its implementation, NPWT has been implemented broadly for chronic non-healing wounds but can also be applied to acute wounds that cannot be closed primarily due to swelling or concern for infection. This type of dressing is typically applied in the operating room but can be done at bedside with appropriate analgesia.

=== Maintenance and surveillance ===
Ideally, wound dressings should be changed daily to promote a clean environment and allow for daily evaluation of wound progression. Highly exudative wounds and infected wounds should be monitored closely and may require more frequent dressing changes. Negative pressure wound dressings can be changed less frequently, every 2–3 days. Wound progression over time can be monitored with transparent sheet tracings or photographs, each of which produce reliable measurements of wound surface area.

===Alternative medicine===
There is moderate evidence that honey is more effective than antiseptic followed by gauze for healing wounds infected after surgical operations. There is a lack of quality evidence relating to the use of honey on other types of wounds, such as minor acute wounds, mixed acute and chronic wounds, pressure ulcers, Fournier&#x27;s gangrene, venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and Leishmaniasis.

Therapeutic touch has been implicated as a complementary therapy in wound healing; however, there is no high quality research supporting its use as an evidence based clinical intervention. More than 400 species of plants are identified as potentially useful for wound healing. Only three randomized controlled trials, however, have been done for the treatment of burns.

==History==

From the Classical Period to the Medieval Period, the body and the soul were believed to be intimately connected, based on several theories put forth by the philosopher Plato. Wounds on the body were believed to correlate with wounds to the soul and vice versa; wounds were seen as an outward sign of an inward illness. Thus, a man who was wounded physically in a serious way was said to be hindered not only physically but spiritually as well. If the soul was wounded, that wound may also eventually become physically manifest, revealing the true state of the soul. Wounds were also seen as writing on the &quot;tablet&quot; of the body. Wounds acquired in war, for example, told the story of a soldier in a form which all could see and understand, and the wounds of a martyr told the story of their faith.

==Research ==

In humans and mice it has been shown that estrogen might positively affect the speed and quality of wound healing.

<text>The null character (also null terminator) is a control character with the value zero.
It is present in many character sets, including those defined by the Baudot and ITA2 codes, ISO/IEC 646 (or ASCII), the C0 control code, the Universal Coded Character Set (or Unicode), and EBCDIC. It is available in nearly all mainstream programming languages. It is often abbreviated as NUL (or NULL, though in some contexts that term is used for the null pointer). In 8-bit codes, it is known as a null byte.

The original meaning of this character was like NOP—when sent to a printer or a terminal, it has no effect (some terminals, however, incorrectly display it as space). When electromechanical teleprinters were used as computer output devices, one or more null characters were sent at the end of each printed line to allow time for the mechanism to return to the first printing position on the next line. On punched tape, the character is represented with no holes at all, so a new unpunched tape is initially filled with null characters, and often text could be inserted at a reserved space of null characters by punching the new characters into the tape over the nulls.

Today the character has much more significance in the programming language C and its derivatives and in many data formats, where it serves as a reserved character used to signify the end of a string, often called a null-terminated string. This allows the string to be any length with only the overhead of one byte; the alternative of storing a count requires either a string length limit of 255 or an overhead of more than one byte (there are other advantages and disadvantages described in the null-terminated string article).

== Representation ==
In source code, the null character is often represented as the escape sequence codice_1 in string literals (for example, codice_2) or in character constants (codice_3); the latter may also be written instead simply as codice_4 (without quotes nor slash). In many languages (such as C, which introduced this notation), this is not a separate escape sequence, but an octal escape sequence with a single octal digit 0; as a consequence, codice_1 must not be followed by any of the digits codice_4 through codice_7; otherwise it is interpreted as the start of a longer octal escape sequence. Other escape sequences that are found in use in various languages are codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, or codice_11. A null character can be placed in a URL with the percent code codice_12.

The ability to represent a null character does not always mean the resulting string will be correctly interpreted, as many programs will consider the null to be the end of the string. Thus the ability to type it (in case of unchecked user input) creates a vulnerability known as null byte injection and can lead to security exploits.

In caret notation the null character is codice_13. On some keyboards, one can enter a null character by holding down and pressing (on US layouts just will often work, there being no need for to get the @ sign).

The hexadecimal notation for null is codice_14. Decoding the Base64 string codice_15 also yields the null character.

In documentation, the null character is sometimes represented as a single-em-width symbol containing the letters &quot;NUL&quot;. In Unicode, there is a character for this: .

== Encoding ==
In all modern character sets, the null character has a code point value of zero. In most encodings, this is translated to a single code unit with a zero value. For instance, in UTF-8 it is a single zero byte. However, in Modified UTF-8 the null character is encoded as two bytes : . This allows the byte with the value of zero, which is not used for any character, to be used as a string terminator.

<text>Big Black was an American punk rock band from Evanston, Illinois, active from 1981 to 1987. Founded first as a solo project by singer and guitarist Steve Albini, the band became a trio with an initial lineup that included guitarist Santiago Durango and bassist Jeff Pezzati, both of Naked Raygun. In 1985, Pezzati was replaced by Dave Riley, who played on Big Black&#x27;s two full-length studio albums, &quot;Atomizer&quot; (1986) and &quot;Songs About Fucking&quot; (1987).

Big Black&#x27;s aggressive and abrasive music was characterized by distinctively clanky guitars and the use of a drum machine rather than a drum kit, elements that foreshadowed industrial rock. The band&#x27;s lyrics flouted commonly held taboos and dealt frankly—and often explicitly—with politically and culturally loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and misogyny. Though the band&#x27;s lyrics contained controversial material, the lyrics were meant to serve as a commentary or a display of distaste for the subject matter. They were staunchly critical of the commercial nature of rock, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career. At the height of their success, they booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, refused to sign contracts, and eschewed many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands. In doing so, they had a significant impact on the aesthetic and political development of independent and underground rock music.

In addition to two studio albums, Big Black released two live albums, two compilation albums, four EPs, and five singles, all through independent record labels. Most of the band&#x27;s catalog was kept in print through Touch and Go Records for years following their breakup.

==History==
===1981–1982: Formation and &quot;Lungs&quot;===
Big Black was founded by Steve Albini in 1981 during his second year of college at Northwestern University. Albini had become a fan of punk rock during his high school years in Missoula, Montana, and taught himself to play bass guitar in the fall of 1979, his senior year, while recuperating from a badly broken leg resulting from being struck by a car while riding his motorcycle. Moving to Evanston, Illinois the following year to pursue a journalism degree and fine art minor at Northwestern, Albini immersed himself in the fledgling Chicago punk scene and became a devoted fan of the band Naked Raygun. He also DJ&#x27;d for the campus radio station, from which he was repeatedly fired for playing loud and abrasive music during the morning time slot as well as not completing the required logs. He also wrote a controversial column titled &quot;Tired of Ugly Fat?&quot; for the Chicago zine &quot;Matter&quot;, publishing confrontational rants about the local music scene which polarized readers into either respecting or hating him.
Albini began playing in college bands, including a short-lived &quot;arty new wave&quot; act called Stations that featured a drum machine. Seeing the advantage in a machine that could play incredibly fast without tiring, always kept a steady beat, and would follow commands exactly, he purchased a Roland TR-606 drum machine and began writing what would become the first Big Black songs. However, he was unable to find other musicians who could play the songs to his satisfaction, later stating in &quot;Forced Exposure&quot; that &quot;I couldn&#x27;t find anybody who didn&#x27;t blow out of a pig&#x27;s asshole.&quot; Instead, in the spring of 1981, he bought a guitar, borrowed a four-track multitrack recorder from a friend in exchange for a case of beer, and spent his spring break week recording the &quot;Lungs&quot; EP in his living room, handling the guitar, bass, and vocals by himself and programming the Roland TR-606 to provide the drum sound. Influenced by bands like Cabaret Voltaire, Killing Joke, and the Cure, the EP is described by &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; author Michael Azerrad as &quot;cold, dark, and resolutely unlistenable&quot;, with the lyrics describing child abusers and other controversial topics, and Albini later regarded the effort as one of his few artistic regrets.

Albini named his new musical project Big Black, calling the moniker &quot;just sort of a reduction of the concept of a large, scary, ominous figure. All the historical images of fear and all the things that kids are afraid of are all big and black, basically.&quot; He used the &quot;Lungs&quot; tape to try to enlist other musicians to the project, briefly recruiting Minor Threat guitarist Lyle Preslar who was attending Northwestern, but the two proved incompatible as musicians. Albini passed &quot;Lungs&quot; on to John Babbin of the small local label Ruthless Records, who released 1,500 copies of the EP in December 1982 with random objects such as dollar bills, used condoms, photographs of Bruce Lee, and bloody pieces of paper thrown into the inserts.

===1983: Full lineup and &quot;Bulldozer&quot;===
In early 1983 Albini met Naked Raygun singer Jeff Pezzati through mutual friends and convinced him to play bass guitar with Big Black. Pezzati recalled that Albini &quot;knew a heck of a lot about, right from the start, how to release a record and get the word out that you have a record&quot;, and that &quot;He jumped at the chance to have a band play his stuff.&quot; The two practiced in Pezzati&#x27;s basement, and one day Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango came downstairs and asked to play along. The trio clicked as a unit, Durango&#x27;s ability to rework arrangements and tweak sounds helping to refine Albini&#x27;s song ideas. According to Albini, &quot;He ended up being absolutely crucial to Big Black.&quot;

Albini &quot;sorta conned&quot; small local label Fever Records into financing the next Big Black EP, bringing in drummer Pat Byrne of Urge Overkill to play on the sessions as accompaniment to the drum machine, which they dubbed &quot;Roland&quot; for album credits. Albini achieved a signature &quot;clanky&quot; sound with his guitar by using metal guitar picks notched with sheet metal clips, creating the effect of two guitar picks at once. The &quot;Bulldozer&quot; EP was recorded with engineer Iain Burgess and released in December 1983, with the first two hundred copies packaged in a galvanized sheet metal sleeve in homage to Public Image Ltd.&#x27;s &quot;Metal Box&quot;. Many of the EP&#x27;s lyrics depicted scenarios drawn from Albini&#x27;s rural upbringing, such as &quot;Cables&quot;, which described the slaughtering of cows at a Montana abattoir, and &quot;Pigeon Kill&quot;, about a rural Indiana town that dealt with an overpopulation of pigeons by feeding them poisoned corn.

===1984: Touring and label signing===
Even with &quot;Bulldozer&quot; released, Big Black drew very small crowds in their native Chicago. They began venturing outside of Illinois to play shows in Madison, Minneapolis, Detroit, and Muncie, transporting themselves and their equipment in a cramped car and sleeping on people&#x27;s floors. Albini handled much of the band&#x27;s logistics himself, setting up rehearsals, booking studio time, and arranging tours. With their reputation growing through small tours, he was able to set up a run of East Coast dates including performances in Washington, D.C., and Boston and at New York City&#x27;s Danceteria, followed by a European tour on which they won acclaim in the United Kingdom&#x27;s music press. Big Black simultaneously found themselves gaining popularity in their hometown, but felt embittered that the same locals who had snubbed them just months before were suddenly interested now that they had built a reputation outside the city, and the band actually refused to play in Chicago for some time.

Part of Big Black&#x27;s local unpopularity stemmed from Albini and the vitriol he regularly directed at Chicago&#x27;s rock scene: by 1985, the Metro Chicago was the only club in the city that was booking punk rock shows and was also large enough to accommodate Big Black, but after performing there Albini badmouthed the club in an interview and found himself banned from it permanently. Compounding the problem were the band&#x27;s aggressive, noise-driven sound and Albini&#x27;s confrontational lyrics, which tested the tolerance of his white liberal audience by mercilessly satirizing racism, sexism, chauvinism, and stereotypes of homosexuality, sometimes using pejoratives like &quot;darkie&quot; and &quot;fag&quot; to drive home the point; this led some listeners to consider him a bigot.
Looking for better distribution of their records, Big Black negotiated a deal with Homestead Records. Gerard Cosloy, who had befriended Albini through writing for &quot;Matter&quot; and gone on to work at Homestead, negotiated an unorthodox deal for the band: Big Black merely licensed their recordings to Homestead for specific lengths of time, rather than the label retaining the rights to the recordings as was typical. Further, the band took no advance payments, paid for their own recordings, and signed no contracts. Durango later remarked that &quot;We came from a punk perspective—we did not want to get sucked into a corporate culture where basically you&#x27;re signing a contract because you don&#x27;t trust the other person to live up to their word. We had ideals, and that was one of our ideals.&quot; The band members figured that if a record company were going to cheat them, they would be able to do so with or without a contract because the band could not afford to defend themselves.

Albini believed that Big Black had nothing to gain by adopting the usual corporate trappings of rock bands: &quot;If you don&#x27;t use contracts, you don&#x27;t have any contracts to worry about. If you don&#x27;t have a tour rider, you don&#x27;t have a tour rider to argue about. If you don&#x27;t have a booking agent, you don&#x27;t have a booking agent to argue with.&quot; Handling the tour booking, equipment hauling, setup, and breakdown of shows themselves also meant that the band did not have to hire a booking agent or road crew with whom they would have to share profits. The lack of a drummer also meant one less member to split profits with, and since there was no drum kit the band did not have to rent a tour van to fit all of their equipment. Thus Big Black was able to profit from most of their tours. They embarked on a 1984 national tour of the United States in preparation for their forthcoming Homestead EP, utilizing the close-knit network of independent rock bands to learn of cities and venues to play.

===1985–1986: &quot;Racer-X&quot; and &quot;Atomizer&quot;===
In late 1984, following the recording of the &quot;Racer-X&quot; EP, Pezzati amicably left the band due to his increasingly demanding job, the need to devote time to his fiancée, and the increasing popularity and busy schedule of Naked Raygun, of which he was still a member. Durango, meanwhile, opted to leave Naked Raygun to commit full-time to Big Black. Pezzati was replaced by Dave Riley, who joined Big Black the week of &quot;Racer-X&quot;&#x27;s release in April 1985. Riley had moved to Chicago in 1982 from Detroit, where he had worked at a studio where funk artists George Clinton and Sly Stone had recorded (he is credited as a recording engineer on Parliament&#x27;s &quot;Trombipulation&quot; and Funkadelic&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Spanking of War Babies&quot;). In Chicago he joined a band called Savage Beliefs, and his playing style impressed Albini and Durango, who invited him to join Big Black as they were recording the songs that would make up the band&#x27;s first full-length album.

Albini claimed to be aiming for a &quot;big, massive, slick rock sound&quot; with &quot;Racer-X&quot;, which was less frantic than &quot;Bulldozer&quot;, but ultimately felt that the EP was &quot;too samey and monolithic.&quot; The band had already begun writing new songs by the time &quot;Racer-X&quot; was released, stating in the last sentence of the EP&#x27;s liner notes that &quot;The next one&#x27;s gonna make you shit your pants.&quot; Big Black&#x27;s first LP, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Atomizer&quot;, found the band at their most musically developed and aggressive level yet. Riley&#x27;s funk background brought a slightly greater sense of melody and danceability to the band, while Albini and Durango&#x27;s guitar work was more violent than ever before. Michael Azerrad comments that &quot;by this time Big Black had both refined the ideas first suggested on &quot;Lungs&quot; and exploded them into something much huger than anyone but Albini had ever imagined&quot;, while Mark Deming of Allmusic states that the album &quot;upped the ante on the musical and lyrical ferocity of Big Black&#x27;s previous body of work, an unrelenting assault of guitar sounds and imagined violence of all sorts.&quot; Albini later remarked that &quot;we just had a higher-than-average percentage of really good songs.&quot; The lyrics on &quot;Atomizer&quot; presented sociopaths committing evil acts that most people only sometimes contemplate: &quot;Big Money&quot; deals with a corrupt police officer, &quot;Bazooka Joe&quot; profiles a shell-shocked veteran who becomes a contract killer, &quot;Stinking Drunk&quot; describes a violent alcoholic, and &quot;Fists of Love&quot; presents a sadist. One of the album&#x27;s most controversial songs was &quot;Jordan, Minnesota&quot;, about the 1983 scandal in Jordan, Minnesota that saw a large number of the rural town&#x27;s adults indicted on charges of involvement in a huge child sex ring.
&quot;Kerosene&quot;, one of &quot;Atomizer&quot;&#x27;s standout tracks, is viewed by both Azerrad and Allmusic&#x27;s Andy Kellman as the band&#x27;s peak performance. Azerrad remarks on its &quot;powerful rhythm ripped straight from Gang of Four and guitars that sound like shattering glass&quot;, while Kellman calls it &quot;undeniably Big Black&#x27;s brightest/bleakest moment, an epically roaming track that features an instantly memorable guitar intro, completely incapable of being accurately described by vocal imitation or physical gesture [...] It&#x27;s Big Black&#x27;s &#x27;Light My Fire,&#x27; literally.&quot; Riley explained that the song was about the effects of boredom in rural America: &quot;There&#x27;s only two things to do: Go blow up a whole load of stuff for fun, or have a lot of sex with the one girl in town who&#x27;ll have sex with anyone. &#x27;Kerosene&#x27; is about a guy who tries to &quot;combine&quot; the two pleasures.&quot;

&quot;Atomizer&quot; was a polarizing record that was praised in the national press and became an underground success, surpassing the band&#x27;s expectations by selling three thousand copies soon after its release. Big Black secured a European distribution deal for their records through Blast First, a label recommended to Albini by Sonic Youth, and met enthusiastic responses to their shows on a 1986 European tour.

The compilation album &quot;The Hammer Party&quot;, combining &quot;Lungs&quot; and &quot;Bulldozer&quot;, was also released through Homestead Records in 1986, but later that year Big Black had a falling out with the label and its distributor, Dutch East India Trading. According to Albini, Dutch East India&#x27;s accounting practices were &quot;always fucked. They would do every sleazy, cheap trick to avoid paying you, like send you a check that wasn&#x27;t signed or send you a check that had a different numeral and literal amount.&quot; Homestead then asked to make five hundred copies of a 12-inch single of &quot;Il Duce&quot; for free distribution to radio stations. The band agreed on the condition that the single was not to be offered for sale, since the song had already been released as a 7-inch single in 1985 and, according to Albini, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want our audience milked for extra money to buy an alternate format.&quot; A few weeks after the single&#x27;s release, Albini began seeing copies for sale in record stores outside of Chicago. He soon found out that the 12-inch single was being sold both in the United States and abroad as a high-priced &quot;collector&#x27;s item&quot;. Though Homestead claimed not to be selling copies, Albini telephoned one of the label&#x27;s salespeople posing as a record buyer and was told that they would sell him copies, but not in Chicago. As a result of the deception, Albini and Big Black severed ties with Homestead and Dutch East India. Though the band was receiving lucrative offers from major labels, they chose to remain independent and signed to Touch and Go Records, Albini being good friends with label head Corey Rusk.

===1987: &quot;Headache&quot;, &quot;Songs About Fucking&quot;, and breakup===
Big Black&#x27;s first release for Touch and Go was the &quot;Headache&quot; EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited original edition of the EP was a pair of forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic &quot;body bag&quot; to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP&#x27;s cover read &quot;Not as good as &quot;Atomizer&quot;, so don&#x27;t get your hopes up, cheese!&quot; According to Durango, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to sit there and screw people. If we felt it wasn&#x27;t as good, then we should just be honest about it.&quot; Indeed, &quot;Headache&quot; recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on &quot;Atomizer&quot;, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that &quot;I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point I think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio.&quot;
Tensions were also mounting within the band. Albini did not drink alcohol, so Riley and Durango became drinking buddies on the road while Albini was doing interviews and handling the band&#x27;s logistics. Riley, however, was drinking to excess, and his behavior ruined several of the band&#x27;s performances. During a key show at CBGB, he drunkenly smashed the drum machine. Albini also accused Riley of a number of other shortcomings including lateness to rehearsals, always needing rides, and &quot;flashes of brilliance offset by flashes of belligerence.&quot; However, though he made a number of threats, Albini never fired Riley. Another problem facing the band was that Riley was now in college and both Albini and Durango had to keep day jobs, which limited Big Black&#x27;s ability to tour. When Durango announced that he intended to enter law school beginning in the fall semester of 1987, the band decided to keep going until he began school and then call it quits. Despite enjoying increased press, radio airplay, record sales, and concert fees, the band did not regret their decision and eschewed the idea of commercial success. According to Riley, &quot;Big Black was never about that. For Big Black to make any money, it wouldn&#x27;t have been Big Black anymore.&quot; Being a lame duck band was also liberating, as the members no longer had to be concerned with the group&#x27;s future. Albini wrote that he was happy to be breaking up the band before it grew too big:
I am now quite happy to be breaking up. Things getting much too big and uncontrollable. All along we&#x27;ve wanted to keep our hands on everything, so nothing happened that we didn&#x27;t want to. With international and multi-format/multi-territorial shit, that&#x27;s proving elusive. I prefer to cut it off rather than have it turn into another Gross Rock Spectacle.
With their breakup announced well in advance, Big Black recorded their final album, &quot;Songs About Fucking&quot;, half in London and half at Albini&#x27;s home studio. Their final tours began in June 1987, taking them to Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and across the United States. They performed at the Pukkelpop festival in Belgium with Sonic Youth on July 22, Albini&#x27;s 25th birthday. At a sold-out show in London for 1,300 people, Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis of Wire joined Big Black onstage to play an encore of Wire&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (Big Black had released a cover version of the song as a single in conjunction with &quot;Headache&quot;). Albini wrote of the experience that &quot;If I die right now it will all have been worth it.&quot; In the United States the band played in San Francisco, Providence, Boston, New York City, and Newport, Kentucky, concluding with their final performance on August 9, 1987, at the Georgetown Steam Plant in Seattle. At the end of this show the band smashed their instruments onstage.

&quot;Songs About Fucking&quot; was released shortly after the band&#x27;s breakup and went on to become their most successful record, with an initial pressing of eight thousand copies. Mark Deming of Allmusic calls it &quot;a scabrous masterpiece&quot;, while his colleague Andy Kellman states that &quot;each [song] is incisive enough to render a razor as effective as a butter knife. In sum: yowl, ching, thump-thump-screech. Ugly characters line up in the songs like early arrivals at a monster truck rally.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau commented that &quot;Anybody who thinks rock and roll is alive and well in the infinite variety of its garage-boy permutations had better figure out how these Hitler Youth rejects could crush the competition and quit simultaneously. No matter what well-meaning rockers think of Steve Albini&#x27;s supremacist lies, they lie themselves if they dismiss what he does with electric guitars—that Killdozer sound culminates if not finishes off whole generations of punk and metal.&quot; Albini himself later considered the album&#x27;s first side as Big Black&#x27;s best output.

===Post-Big Black===

Following Big Black&#x27;s breakup, Albini formed and fronted Rapeman from 1987 to 1989 and Shellac from 1992 until his death in 2024. He also began work as a recording engineer, working with artists such as Slint, the Pixies, the Breeders, Pegboy, Urge Overkill, the Jesus Lizard, the Wedding Present, Superchunk, PJ Harvey, Nirvana, Bush, and Page and Plant. Some of his most well-known recordings include the Pixies&#x27; &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; (1988), Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;In Utero&quot; (1993), Bush&#x27;s &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot; (1996), and Page and Plant&#x27;s &quot;Walking into Clarksdale&quot; (1998). In 1997 he opened his own recording studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago. Albini&#x27;s recording style is characterized by the use of vintage microphones placed strategically around the performance room, keeping vocals very low in the mix, and using few special effects. He is also known for recording almost any artist who requests his services (usually at very low rates but deliberately charging high amounts to artists on major record labels), disliking being credited on the albums he works on (insisting on being credited as a recording engineer rather than a producer, if at all), and refusing to take royalties for his work (calling them &quot;an insult to the band&quot;).

Durango, meanwhile, continued to play music during his law school years, releasing two EPs on Touch and Go as Arsenal and recording with Boss Hog. He then became a practicing lawyer, with clients including Touch and Go Records and Cynthia Plaster Caster. Riley recorded tracks with the groups Algebra Suicide, Bull, and Flour before being incapacitated by a stroke in 1995, which was initially erroneously reported as a suicide attempt. Having lost the ability to walk, he authored a blog about his experiences titled &quot;Worthless Goddamn Cripple&quot;. In 2004 he participated in a musical project called Miasma of Funk, releasing the album &quot;Groove on the Mania!&quot;, and in 2006 published the book &quot;Blurry and Disconnected: Tales of Sink-or-Swim Nihilism&quot;. Riley died December 24, 2019, at the age of 59, from squamous cell carcinoma that began in his throat and spread to his lungs.

In 1992 Big Black&#x27;s catalog reverted to Touch and Go Records, who re-released their entire discography and kept their records in print long after the band&#x27;s breakup. That October the label released the live album and video &quot;Pigpile&quot;, recorded in London during the band&#x27;s final tours, as well as the compilation album &quot;The Rich Man&#x27;s Eight Track Tape&quot;, which combined tracks from &quot;Atomizer&quot;, &quot;Headache&quot;, and the &quot;Heartbeat&quot; single in compact disc format. The re-released version of &quot;The Hammer Party&quot; was expanded to include the tracks from &quot;Racer-X&quot;.

On September 9, 2006, Albini and Durango reunited with original bassist Jeff Pezzati for a Big Black reunion performance at Touch and Go&#x27;s 25th Anniversary festival. Albini&#x27;s touring schedule with Shellac did not allow time for the band to rehearse a full set, so they instead played a short set of four songs: &quot;Cables&quot;, &quot;Dead Billy&quot;, &quot;Pigeon Kill&quot;, and &quot;Racer-X&quot;. Albini explained that the performance was &quot;not about Big Black wanting to get back together or even an audience wanting to see Big Black, it&#x27;s that ... to not honor Touch and Go would be an insult by way of damning with faint praise&quot;, describing the label as &quot;[not] just a benchmark for how a record label should behave, but how people should behave.&quot; During the performance he stated that &quot;You can tell [this is] not something we had a burning desire to do, but we did it because we love Touch and Go [and] we love Corey Rusk [...] When history talks about rock music it has a tendency to skip from the Sex Pistols to Nirvana, [but] something started in the 1980s and you&#x27;re seeing the evidence of it all around you&quot;, remarking that the label was &quot;the best thing to happen to music in my lifetime, and we did this to say thanks&quot;. The performance prompted offers from promoters for further reunion shows, but Albini stated flatly &quot;that is definitely not going to happen.&quot;

Albini died at age 61 on May 7, 2024, of a heart attack.

==Style==
===Music===
Big Black&#x27;s music challenged convention, pursuing an abrasive sound that was more aggressive than contemporary punk rock. Albini explained that the band strove for intensity, stating that their goal was to make &quot;something that felt intense when we went through it, rather than something that had little coded &quot;indicators&quot; of intensity. Heavy metal and stuff like that didn&#x27;t really seem intense to me, it seemed comical to me. Hardcore punk didn&#x27;t really seem intense most of the time—most of the time it just seemed childish. I guess that&#x27;s how I would differentiate what we were doing from what other people were doing.&quot; Both Albini and Riley described Big Black as a punk rock band. AllMusic has associated their sound with both hardcore and post-punk and described them as influential to indie rock as well as pioneers of noise rock and post-hardcore.

A major component of Big Black&#x27;s music was the drum machine. Rather than attempt to make it emulate the sound of a normal drum kit, the band chose to exploit the idiosyncrasies of its synthetic sounds. On many songs Albini programmed it to accent the first and third beats of the bar, rather than the second and fourth beats typically accented in rock music. &quot;The effect was a monolithic pummeling, an attack&quot;, says Michael Azerrad, &quot;their groove, normally the most human aspect of a rock band, became its most inhuman; it only made them sound more insidious, its relentlessness downright tyrannical.&quot; On tour, the sound engineers at many rock clubs were befuddled by the drum machine, afraid that it would not work with their sound system or would blow out their speakers, and the band would have to coerce the club owner or threaten to cancel the show in order to get them to put the drum machine through the monitors.

The band&#x27;s guitar sound was also unconventional. Albini was determined to avoid the &quot;standard rock stud guitar sound&quot;, and achieved a signature &quot;clanky&quot; sound by using metal guitar picks notched by sheet metal snips; the notch causing the pick to hit each string twice, creating the effect of two simultaneous guitar picks. Durango remarked: &quot;I always thought that our guitar playing was not so much playing guitars, but assembling noises &quot;created&quot; by guitars.&quot; He and Albini respectively billed their guitars as &quot;vroom&quot; and &quot;skinng&quot; in the liner notes for &quot;Atomizer&quot;. Mark Deming of AllMusic remarks that &quot;The group&#x27;s guitars alternately sliced like a machete and ground like a dentist&#x27;s drill, creating a groundbreaking and monolithic dissonance in the process.&quot;

Big Black&#x27;s music was influenced by a number of genres and artists. Albini was a fan of punk rock bands including Suicide, the Ramones, the Stooges, and Naked Raygun. When Riley joined the band in 1985 he brought with him a funk background, having worked at a Detroit studio where George Clinton and Sly Stone had recorded. During their career Big Black recorded cover versions of songs from a number of styles including post-punk, new wave, funk, hard rock, synthpop, and R&amp;B; these included Rema-Rema&#x27;s &quot;Rema-Rema&quot;, James Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Payback&quot;, Wire&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;He&#x27;s a Whore&quot;, Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;The Model&quot;, and the Mary Jane Girls&#x27; &quot;In My House&quot;. The sound that Big Black forged for themselves, however, was wholly original: Azerrad remarks that &quot;the band&#x27;s music—jagged, brutal, loud, and nasty—was original to a downright confrontational degree. Big Black distilled years of post-punk and hardcore down to a sound resembling a singing saw blade mercillesly tearing through sheet metal. No one had made records that sounded so harsh.&quot;

===Lyrics===
Big Black&#x27;s songs explored the dark side of American culture in unforgiving detail, acknowledging no taboos. Albini&#x27;s lyrics openly dealt with such topics as mutilation, murder, rape, child abuse, arson, immolation, racism, and misogyny. &quot;That&#x27;s just what was interesting to me as a postcollegiate bohemian&quot;, he later remarked. &quot;We didn&#x27;t have a manifesto. Nothing was off-limits; it&#x27;s just that that&#x27;s what came up most of the time.&quot; Many of his songs told miniature short stories of sociopaths doing evil things that the average person might merely contemplate. Some, such as &quot;Cables&quot;, &quot;Pigeon Kill&quot;, and &quot;Jordan, Minnesota&quot;, were based on real events, or things that Albini had witnessed during his Montana upbringing. He compared the stories to &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, saying that &quot;If you stumble across something like this, you think &#x27;This can&#x27;t be!&#x27; But it turns out to be true, and that makes it even wilder.&quot;
Albini&#x27;s lyrics drew criticism for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism was a frequent theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word &quot;darkie&quot; appeared in the first line of the &quot;Lungs&quot; EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying &quot;in a way that&#x27;s a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that&#x27;s so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don&#x27;t know.&quot; He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word &quot;fag&quot;: &quot;Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word &#x27;fag&#x27; isn&#x27;t just a gay term, it&#x27;s funny on its own — phonetically — like the words &#x27;hockey puck,&#x27; &#x27;mukluks,&#x27; &#x27;gefilte fish,&#x27; and &#x27;Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini&#x27;s part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: &quot;So once that&#x27;s given, once you know what you think, there&#x27;s no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they&#x27;re very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don&#x27;t realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak.&quot;

Albini also emphasized that the songs&#x27; lyrics were not the focal point of Big Black, and that the vocals were only there out of necessity: &quot;It seemed like, as instrumental music, it didn&#x27;t have enough emotional intensity at times, so there would be vocals. But the vocals were not intended to be the center of attention — the interaction within the band and the chaotic nature of the music, that was the important part.&quot; However, he did enjoy testing the tolerance of the white liberal hipsters in his audience and provoking reactions out of listeners, stating that one of the band&#x27;s goals was &quot;to have pointedly offensive records&quot;. Terri Sutton of &quot;Puncture&quot; magazine wrote that the band&#x27;s stark presentation of evil, deep-seated human impulses bolstered their work against criticism: &quot;The topics are so deliberately loaded that you can&#x27;t criticize their &#x27;art&#x27; without looking like some fucking puritan.&quot;

===Live performances===
Onstage, Big Black presented an intense spectacle to match their music. Albini would set off a brick of firecrackers onstage before the band played, a tradition he carried on from their earliest performances through their dissolution and revived for their 2006 reunion set, and would count in most songs by yelling &quot;One, two, fuck you!&quot; While playing, the band members would slam their hands against their steel guitar strings so hard that they would draw blood, often needing to put adhesive bandages on their fingers. Albini used a specially-made hip-slung guitar strap worn around his waist like a belt, and would &quot;prowl the stage like a spindly gunslinger&quot;, according to Azerrad. Gerard Cosloy recalls that &quot;It looked like someone had plugged Steve into the amp [...] he was pretty scary to watch onstage.&quot;

During performances of &quot;Jordan, Minnesota&quot;, the band would reach a point where they would prolong a discordant, creepy noise while Albini would perform an intense pantomime as though he were one of the children from the song&#x27;s lyrics being raped. &quot;It was actually very disturbing to watch&quot;, says Durango, &quot;It would really get people unsettled.&quot; The band would respond to hecklers with acidic comebacks or deliberately offensive jokes. Describing the intensity of a January 1987 Big Black performance in &quot;Forced Exposure&quot;, Lydia Lunch remarked that &quot;I was pulverized into near oblivion as wall after wall of frustration, heartache, hatred, death, disease, dis-use, disgust, mistrust, and maelstrom stormed the stage waging war with military precision insistently invading every open orifice with the strength of ten thousand bulls&quot;.

==Influence==

Through their aggressive guitar playing and use of a drum machine, Big Black&#x27;s music served as a precursor to industrial rock. Aesthetically, the band&#x27;s firmly-held ideals, staunch independence, insistence on creative control, and stark lyrical topics had a significant impact on the developing independent rock community. &quot;Big Black was a band that went where few bands dared to go (and where many felt bands shouldn&#x27;t go),&quot; writes Mark Deming, &quot;and for good or ill their pervasive influence had a seismic impact on indie rock.&quot; Albini summed up several of the band&#x27;s core ideals in his notes to the &quot;Pigpile&quot; album:
Organizationally, we were committed to a few basic principles: Treat everyone with as much respect as he deserves (and no more), Avoid people who appeal to our vanity or ambition (they always have an angle), Operate as much as possible apart from the &quot;music scene&quot; (which was never our stomping ground), and Take no shit from anyone in the process.

<doc id="338167" wikidata="Q9357437" url="?curid=338167" title="Null-terminated string">
<text>In computer programming, a null-terminated string is a character string stored as an array containing the characters and terminated with a &quot;null character&quot; (a character with an internal value of zero, called &quot;NUL&quot; in this article, not same as the glyph zero). Alternative names are &quot;C string&quot;, which refers to the C programming language and ASCIIZ (although C can use encodings other than ASCII).

The length of a string is found by searching for the (first) NUL. This can be slow as it takes O(&quot;n&quot;) (linear time) with respect to the string length. It also means that a string cannot contain a NUL (there is a NUL in memory, but it is after the last character, not the string).

== History ==
Null-terminated strings were produced by the codice_1 directive of the PDP-11 assembly languages and the codice_2 directive of the MACRO-10 macro assembly language for the PDP-10. These predate the development of the C programming language, but other forms of strings were often used.

At the time C (and the languages that it was derived from) was developed, memory was extremely limited, so using only one byte of overhead to store the length of a string was attractive. The only popular alternative at that time, usually called a &quot;Pascal string&quot; (a more modern term is &quot;length-prefixed&quot;), used a leading &quot;byte&quot; to store the length of the string. This allows the string to contain NUL and made finding the length need only one memory access (O(1) (constant) time), but limited string length to 255 characters. C designer Dennis Ritchie chose to follow the convention of null-termination to avoid the limitation on the length of a string and because maintaining the count seemed, in his experience, less convenient than using a terminator.

This had some influence on CPU instruction set design. Some CPUs in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Zilog Z80 and the DEC VAX, had dedicated instructions for handling length-prefixed strings. However, as the null-terminated string gained traction, CPU designers began to take it into account, as seen for example in IBM&#x27;s decision to add the &quot;Logical String Assist&quot; instructions to the ES/9000 520 in 1992 and the vector string instructions to the IBM z13 in 2015.

FreeBSD developer Poul-Henning Kamp, writing in &quot;ACM Queue&quot;, referred to the victory of null-terminated strings over a 2-byte (not one-byte) length as &quot;the most expensive one-byte mistake&quot; ever.

== Limitations ==
While simple to implement, this representation has been prone to errors and performance problems.

Null-termination has historically created security problems. A NUL inserted into the middle of a string will truncate it unexpectedly. A common bug was to not allocate the additional space for the NUL, so it was written over adjacent memory. Another was to not write the NUL at all, which was often not detected during testing because the block of memory already contained zeros. Due to the expense of finding the length, many programs did not bother before copying a string to a fixed-size buffer, causing a buffer overflow if it was too long.

The inability to store a zero requires that text and binary data be kept distinct and handled by different functions (with the latter requiring the length of the data to also be supplied). This can lead to code redundancy and errors when the wrong function is used.

The speed problems with finding the length can usually be mitigated by combining it with another operation that is O(&quot;n&quot;) anyway, such as in codice_3. However, this does not always result in an intuitive API.

== Character encodings ==
Null-terminated strings require that the encoding does not use a zero byte (0x00) anywhere; therefore it is not possible to store every possible ASCII or UTF-8 string. However, it is common to store the subset of ASCII or UTF-8 – every character except NUL – in null-terminated strings. Some systems use &quot;modified UTF-8&quot; which encodes NUL as two non-zero bytes (0xC0, 0x80) and thus allow all possible strings to be stored. This is not allowed by the UTF-8 standard, because it is an overlong encoding, and it is seen as a security risk. Some other byte may be used as end of string instead, like 0xFE or 0xFF, which are not used in UTF-8.

UTF-16 uses 2-byte integers and as either byte may be zero (and in fact &quot;every other&quot; byte is, when representing ASCII text), cannot be stored in a null-terminated byte string. However, some languages implement a string of 16-bit UTF-16 characters, terminated by a 16-bit NUL (0x0000).

== Improvements ==
Many attempts to make C string handling less error prone have been made. One strategy is to add safer functions such as codice_4 and codice_3, whilst deprecating the use of unsafe functions such as codice_6. Another is to add an object-oriented wrapper around C strings so that only safe calls can be done. However, it is possible to call the unsafe functions anyway.

Most modern libraries replace C strings with a structure containing a 32-bit or larger length value (far more than were ever considered for length-prefixed strings), and often add another pointer, a reference count, and even a NUL to speed up conversion back to a C string. Memory is far larger now, such that if the addition of 3 (or 16, or more) bytes to each string is a real problem the software will have to be dealing with so many small strings that some other storage method will save even more memory (for instance there may be so many duplicates that a hash table will use less memory). Examples include the C++ Standard Template Library codice_7, the Qt codice_8, the MFC codice_9, and the C-based implementation codice_10 from Core Foundation as well as its Objective-C sibling codice_11 from Foundation, both by Apple. More complex structures may also be used to store strings such as the rope.

<text>Cardiff University () is a public research university in Cardiff, Wales. It was established in 1883 as the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire and became a founding college of the University of Wales in 1893. It was renamed University College, Cardiff in 1972 and merged with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology in 1988 to become University of Wales College, Cardiff and then University of Wales, Cardiff in 1996. In 1997 it received degree-awarding powers, but held them in abeyance. It adopted the operating name of Cardiff University in 1999; this became its legal name in 2005, when it became an independent university awarding its own degrees.

Cardiff University is the only Welsh member of the Russell Group of research-intensive British universities. Academics and alumni of the university have included four heads of state or government and two Nobel laureates. the university&#x27;s academics include 17 fellows of the Royal Society, 11 fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering, seven fellows of the British Academy, 21 fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences and 32 fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences.

==History==
===University college===
The foundation of the university college in Cardiff that was to become Cardiff University was part of the Welsh university movement of the second half of the 19th century, which also led to the foundation of the colleges at Aberystwyth and Bangor (now Aberystwyth and Bangor universities) and the federal University of Wales. The movement began at a meeting in London in 1854 called by Hugh Owen, including leaders of Welsh theological colleges and members of parliament. This meeting discussed establishing university colleges in Wales along the same lines as the Queen&#x27;s Colleges established the previous decade in Ireland, and produced a formal proposal, the &quot;Outline of Constitution for Proposed Welsh Queen&#x27;s Colleges&quot;.

Discussions on the founding of a university college in South Wales were revived in 1879, when a group of Welsh and English MPs urged the government to consider the poor provision of higher and intermediate education in Wales and &quot;the best means of assisting any local effort which may be made for supplying such deficiency.&quot;

In August 1880, William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s government appointed a departmental committee to conduct &quot;an enquiry into the nature and extent of intermediate and higher education in Wales&quot;, chaired by the 1st Baron Aberdare and consisting of Viscount Emlyn, the Reverend Prebendary H. G. Robinson, Henry Richard, John Rhys and Lewis Morris. The Aberdare Report, as it came to be known, took evidence from a wide range of sources and over 250 witnesses and recommended a college each for North Wales and South Wales, the latter to be located in Glamorgan and the former to be the established University College of Wales in Aberystwyth (now Aberystwyth University). The committee cited the unique Welsh national identity and noted that many students in Wales could not afford to travel to University in England or Scotland. It advocated a national degree-awarding university for Wales, composed of regional colleges, which should be non-sectarian in nature and exclude the teaching of theology.
After the recommendation was published, Cardiff Corporation sought to secure the location of the college in Cardiff, and on 12 December 1881 formed a University College Committee to aid the matter. There was competition to be the site between Swansea and Cardiff. On 12 March 1883, after arbitration, a decision was made in Cardiff&#x27;s favour. This was strengthened by the need to consider the interests of Monmouthshire, at that time not legally incorporated into Wales, and the greater sum received by Cardiff in support of the college, through a public appeal that raised £37,000 and a number of private donations, notably from the 3rd Marquess of Bute and Lord Windsor. In April, Lord Aberdare was appointed as the college&#x27;s first president. The possible locations considered included Cardiff Arms Park, Cathedral Road, and Moira Terrace, Roath, before the site of the Old Royal Infirmary buildings on Newport Road was chosen.

The University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire opened on 24 October 1883 with courses in biology, chemistry, English, French, German, Greek, history, Latin, mathematics and astronomy, music, Welsh, logic and philosophy, and physics. It was incorporated by royal charter the following year; this was the first charter in Wales to allow the enrolment of women and to specifically forbid religious tests for entry. John Viriamu Jones was appointed as the college&#x27;s first principal at the age of 27. As the college was not an independent university and could not award its own degrees, it prepared its students for the examinations of the University of London or for further study at Oxford or Cambridge.

In 1888 the university college at Cardiff and the University College of North Wales (now Bangor University) proposed to the University College Wales at Aberystwyth joint action to gain a university charter for Wales, modelled on that of the Victoria University, a federal university in northern England with colleges in Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. This led to a charter being granted to the University of Wales in 1893, with the colleges becoming members of the new university. The position of operational head would rotate among heads of the colleges.

In 1885, Aberdare Hall opened as the first hall of residence, allowing women access to the college. This moved to its current site in 1895, but remains a single-sex hall. In 1904 the college appointed the first female associate professor in the UK, Millicent Mackenzie, who in 1910 became the first female full professor at a fully chartered UK university.

In 1901, John Viriamu Jones persuaded Cardiff Corporation to give the college a five-acre site in Cathays Park (instead of selling it as they would have done otherwise). Soon after, in 1905, work on a new building commenced under the architect W. D. Caröe. Money ran short for the project, however, and although the side-wings were completed in the 1960s the planned 
great hall was never built. Caroe sought to combine the charm and elegance of his &quot;alma mater&quot; (Trinity College, Cambridge) with the picturesque balance of many Oxford colleges. On 14 October 1909 the &quot;New College&quot; building in Cathays Park (now Main Building) and the &quot;Drapers&#x27; Library&quot; (now the Science Library) was opened in a ceremony involving a procession from the &quot;Old College&quot; in Newport Road.

In 1931, the medical school, founded as part of the college in 1893 along with the departments of anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology, was split off to form the Welsh National School of Medicine, renamed the University of Wales College of Medicine in 1984.

The University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire was renamed University College, Cardiff in 1972.

===1988 merger===
In 1988, University College Cardiff ran into financial difficulties and a declaration of insolvency was considered. This led to a merger with the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST) to form the University of Wales College of Cardiff. The principal of the new institution was Sir Aubrey Trotman-Dickenson, who had been the principal of UWIST. After changes to the constitution in 1996, its name was changed to the University of Wales, Cardiff.

In the early 1990s, the university&#x27;s computer systems served as the home for The Internet Movie Database.

===Independence and 2004 merger===

The college was granted degree-awarding powers by the Privy Council in 1997 although, as a member of the University of Wales, it did not use them at that time. In 1999, the public name of the university was changed to Cardiff University.

In 2002, ideas were floated to re-merge Cardiff with the University of Wales College of Medicine (UWCM), after the publication of the Welsh Assembly Government&#x27;s review of higher education in Wales. This set in train a series of constitutional reforms. On 1 August 2004, Cardiff University ceased to be a member of the University of Wales and became an independent &quot;link institution&quot; affiliated to the federal university. The process of the merger with UWCM was completed on 1 December 2004, when the Act of Parliament transferring UWCM&#x27;s assets to Cardiff University received royal assent. On 17 December it was announced that the Privy Council had given approval to a new supplemental charter for the keys institution. This was sealed on 11 March 2005, granting university status to Cardiff and legally changing the name of the institution to Cardiff University. Cardiff awarded University of Wales degrees to students admitted before 2005, but has subsequently awarded its own degrees.
In 2005, Wales College of Medicine, as part of the university, launched the North Wales Clinical School in Wrexham, in collaboration with the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education in Wrexham, the University of Wales, Bangor, and the National Health Service in Wales. This received funds of £12.5 million from the Welsh Assembly and trebled the number of trainee doctors in clinical training in Wales over a four-year period.

The university also has a Centre for Lifelong Learning, which has been teaching a wide range of courses for over 125 years. However, in July 2009, the university announced it was ending over 250 humanities courses at the centre, making over 100 staff redundant. The university has since reintroduced a number of humanities courses for a trial period beginning in 2010.

In June 2010, the university launched three new research institutes, each offering a new approach to a major modern research issue. The Neurosciences and Mental Health Research Institute and the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute are housed in the purpose-built Hadyn Ellis Building and in the Sustainable Places Research Institute. Another part of the Science and Development Campus, the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC), opened in June 2016 for neuroimaging research.

===Workload controversy===
On 19 February 2018, Malcolm Anderson, a university lecturer committed suicide at age 48 by jumping off a university building. The inquiry determined that Anderson&#x27;s suicide was the result of a high-pressure workload.

In 2020, Grace Krause, a PhD student employed at Cardiff University started experiencing headaches and back pain after lengthy work at a computer. She tweeted that &quot;Staff are marking hundreds of essays in an impossibly short time. It is exhausting. Everyone is in crisis mode. Stressed, moody, morose, everyone feels like they’re drowning.&quot; Soon after, an email from the university was sent to all PhD students asking for these comments to be deleted, in order to avoid negative media attention, which sparked a debate about freedom of speech between employers and employees.

=== 2025 cost-cutting measures ===
Cardiff University announced in January 2025 that it had an operating deficit of £31.2 million for 2023–24 and announced a three-month consultation on plans to reduce its academic workforce by approximately 400 full-time equivalent positions, representing around 7 per cent of its total staff, as well as discontinuing programs in ancient history, modern languages and translation, music, nursing, and religion and theology, and merging other academic departments. The Arts and Humanities are expected to suffer most severely, with the remaining workforce to be reduced by approximately 120 full-time equivalent positions, which is around half. The university had around £500 million in unrestricted reserves according to its accounts for 2023–24, which the Universities and Colleges Union said should be partially used to give a longer period for the university&#x27;s finances to recover. However, the university said that &quot;unrestricted reserves&quot; was not the same as cash available to spend. The university&#x27;s accounts contain the statement that &quot;Of the University’s £426m of cash and investments as at 31 July 2024, £41m is freely available to spend.&quot; A document circulated internally but leaked to the press revealed that further job losses in non-academic staff were expected on top of the 400 academic staff posts and outlined plans for a smaller but higher-quality student intake in future. It also revealed that the projected deficit for 2024–25, if no action was taken, was £65 million, double the deficit for 2023–24, with the cuts designed to reduce the deficit to £28 million.

The university&#x27;s deficit is part of the wider financial challenges in the UK higher education sector, where universities are facing budget deficits due to factors such as tuition fee caps, rising operational costs, and fluctuations in student enrolment. Other institutions, have also announced staff reductions and course closures. The proposed cuts at Cardiff also led to protests at the Senedd, where the Welsh Government said that there was no more money available for higher education despite universities across Wales suffering financial crises and implementing job cuts and campus closures.

==Insignia and other representations==
===Motto===
Cardiff University&#x27;s motto is &quot;Gwirionedd, Undod a Chytgord&quot;. The Welsh motto translates as &quot;Truth, Unity and Concord&quot; or &quot;Truth, Unity and Harmony&quot;. It is taken from the prayer for the Church militant as it appears in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
Cardiff University&#x27;s current coat of arms was granted by the College of Arms in 1988 following the merger of University College Cardiff and the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. The coat of arms incorporates features from the heraldry of both former institutions. The three chevrons are derived from the arms of the de Clare lords of Glamorgan. The open book signifies learning; on it are the crescent and annulet, marks of cadence that indicate that University College Cardiff was the second of the University of Wales&#x27; institutions, and that the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology was the fifth.

A notable feature of the arms are the supporters, which in heraldry are rarely granted to universities. The supporters are an angel from University College Cardiff and a Welsh Dragon from the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. The crest is a Welsh dragon in the stance of a lion; it stands on the helmet. Both the dragon and the helmet are distinguished by being front-facing rather than in profile as is more usually found in Welsh heraldry.

<doc id="338183" wikidata="Q2294155" url="?curid=338183" title="The Sirens of Titan">
<text>The Sirens of Titan is a comic science fiction novel by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., first published in 1959. His second novel, it involves issues of free will, omniscience, and the overall purpose of human history, with much of the story revolving around a Martian invasion of Earth.

==Plot==
This novel begins with an omniscient comment: &quot;Everyone now knows how to find the meaning of life within himself. But mankind wasn&#x27;t always so lucky.&quot;

Malachi Constant is the richest man in a future North America. He possesses extraordinary luck that he attributes to divine favor which he has used to build upon his father&#x27;s fortune. He becomes the centerpoint of a journey that takes him from Earth to Mars in preparation for an interplanetary war, to Mercury with another Martian survivor of that war, back to Earth to be pilloried as a sign of Man&#x27;s displeasure with his arrogance, and finally to Titan where he again meets the man ostensibly responsible for the turn of events that have befallen him, Winston Niles Rumfoord.

Rumfoord comes from a wealthy New England background. His private fortune was large enough to fund the construction of a personal spacecraft, and he became a space explorer. Traveling between Earth and Mars, his ship—carrying Rumfoord and his dog, Kazak—entered a phenomenon known as a &quot;chrono-synclastic infundibulum&quot;, which is defined in the novel as &quot;those places ... where all the different kinds of truths fit together&quot;. When they enter the infundibulum, Rumfoord and Kazak become &quot;wave phenomena&quot;, somewhat akin to the probability waves encountered in quantum mechanics. They exist along a spiral stretching from the Sun to the star Betelgeuse. When a planet, such as the Earth, intersects their spiral, Rumfoord and Kazak materialize, temporarily, on that planet.

When he entered the chrono-synclastic infundibulum, Rumfoord became aware of the past and future. Throughout the novel, he predicts events; unless he is deliberately lying, the predictions come true. It is in this state that Rumfoord established the &quot;Church of God the Utterly Indifferent&quot; on Earth to unite the planet after a Martian invasion. It is also in this state that Rumfoord, materializing on different planets, instigated the Martian invasion, which was designed to fail spectacularly. On Titan, the only place where he can exist permanently as a solid human being, Rumfoord befriends a traveller from Tralfamadore (a world that also figures in Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, among others) who needs a small metal component to repair his damaged spaceship.

Salo, the Tralfamadorian explorer, is a robot built millennia earlier to carry a message to a distant galaxy. His spacecraft is powered by the Universal Will to Become or UWTB, the &quot;prime mover&quot; which makes matter and organization wish to appear out of nothingness. (UWTB, Vonnegut informs the reader, was responsible for the Universe in the first place and is the greatest imaginable power source). A small component on Salo&#x27;s spacecraft breaks and strands him here in the Solar System for over 200 millennia. He requests help from Tralfamadore, and his fellow Tralfamadorians respond by manipulating human history so that primitive humans evolve and create a civilization in order to produce the replacement part. Rumfoord&#x27;s encounter with the chrono-synclastic infundibulum, the following war with Mars and Constant&#x27;s exile to Titan were manipulated via the Tralfamadorians&#x27; control of the UWTB. Stonehenge, the Great Wall of China and the Kremlin are all messages in the Tralfamadorian geometrical language, informing Salo of their progress.

As it turns out, the replacement part is a small metal strip, brought to Salo by Constant and his son Chrono (born of Rumfoord&#x27;s ex-wife). A sunspot disrupts Rumfoord&#x27;s spiral, sending him and Kazak separately into the vastness of space. An argument between Rumfoord and Salo moments before concerning the contents of Salo&#x27;s message, left unresolved because of Rumfoord&#x27;s disappearance, leads the distraught Salo to disassemble himself, thereby stranding the humans on Titan. It is revealed that the message was a single dot, meaning &quot;Greetings&quot; in Tralfamadorian. Chrono chooses to live among the Titanian birds; after thirty-two years, his mother dies and Constant manages to reassemble Salo. Using the part delivered so many years previously by Chrono, Constant repairs the Tralfamadorian saucer. Salo wishes to place the aging Constant at a shuffleboard court, but Constant insists on being dropped off in Indianapolis, where he dies of exposure in the wintertime while awaiting an overdue city bus. As he passes away, he experiences a pleasant hallucination secretly implanted in his mind by a compassionate Salo.

== Major themes ==
&quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; largely deals with questions of free will, with multiple characters being stripped of it and the revelation that humanity had been secretly manipulated for millennia for an inane purpose, playing major roles in the story. Free will and the lack thereof became major themes in Vonnegut&#x27;s later novels, especially &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1969) and &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; (1972). More broadly speaking, lack of agency has been a hallmark of Vonnegut&#x27;s novels, with the protagonists struggling against forces they can never overcome and often can&#x27;t comprehend. None of the characters in &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; have chosen to be in their position, but are driven by forces and wills beside their own, and can do no more than try to make the best of it. At the end of the book Constant concludes, &quot;A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved.&quot;

== Style ==
The novel is simple in syntax and sentence structure, part of Vonnegut&#x27;s signature style. Likewise, irony, sentimentality, black humor, and didacticism are prevalent throughout the novel.

==Background==
According to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, Vonnegut &quot;put together the whole of &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; ... in one night ... [H]e was at a party where someone told him he ought to write another novel. So they went into the next room where he just verbally pieced together this book from the things that were around in his mind.&quot;

==Reception==

Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1961 rated &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; 4.5 stars out of five, stating that &quot;The plot is tangled, intricate and tortuous&quot; but &quot;the book, though exasperating, is a joy of inventiveness&quot;. It was a finalist for the 1960 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

William Deresiewicz, in a 2012 retrospective published after a second Library of America collection of Vonnegut&#x27;s work was released, wrote:
Artistically, though, [&quot;Player Piano&quot;] is apprentice work—clunky, clumsy, overstuffed. Turn the page to &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (1959), however, and it&#x27;s all there, all at once. Kurt Vonnegut has become Kurt Vonnegut. The spareness hits you first. The first page contains fourteen paragraphs, none of them longer than two sentences, some of them as short as five words. It&#x27;s like he&#x27;s placing pieces on a game board—so, and so, and so. The story moves from one intensely spotlit moment to the next, one idea to the next, without delay or filler. The prose is equally efficient, with a scalding syncopated wit: &quot;&#x27;I told her that you and she were to be married on Mars.&#x27; He shrugged. &#x27;Not married exactly—&#x27; he said, &#x27;but bred by the Martians—like farm animals.&#x27;&quot;

== Publishing history ==
In 2000 or early 2001, RosettaBooks, an independent e-book publisher, contracted with Vonnegut to publish e-book editions of several of his novels, including &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;. Random House sued RosettaBooks in February 2001, claiming (with respect to Vonnegut) that the contracts he signed with (predecessor-in-interest) Dell in 1967 and 1970 granted Random House e-book publishing rights as well. In July 2001, Judge Sidney H. Stein denied Random House&#x27;s request for an injunction; in December 2002, Random House and Rosetta Books settled out-of-court, with RosettaBooks retaining the publishing rights that Random House had challenged.

In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, narrated by Jay Snyder, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

==Adaptations==
In the 1970s, the Organic Theatre Company presented &quot;Sirens&quot;, a stage adaptation of &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, designed by James Maronek and directed by Stuart Gordon, the company&#x27;s founder; it used &quot;a simple set, a few pieces of furniture and a white backdrop curtain as a space-time warp&quot;. It was staged in October 1977 at the University of California, San Diego.
Gordon&#x27;s adaptation was produced again 40 years later in 2017 at Los Angeles&#x27; Sacred Fools Theater Company, this time directed by film and theater director Ben Rock, with the adaptation newly updated by Gordon. Also, in the early 1970s, Central Michigan University (Mt. Pleasant, MI) staged a production of &quot;The Sirens Of Titan&quot; under the direction of Professor Elbert Bowen, featuring Terry O&#x27;Quinn in the role of Malachi Constant.

Vonnegut sold the film rights to &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot; to Jerry Garcia, guitarist and vocalist for rock band The Grateful Dead. Garcia began working with Tom Davis in early December 1983 and finished their first draft in January 1985. Garcia commented on the book and the screenplay in a November 1987 interview:

Garcia died in 1995 before bringing the film to the screen. After waiting a &quot;respectable period of time&quot;, Robert B. Weide, who had written and produced the 1996 film adaptation of &quot;Mother Night&quot; and had been working on a Vonnegut documentary for years (it would after long last be released in 2021), asked the author about the status of the rights. Vonnegut bought back the rights from Garcia&#x27;s estate and gave them to Weide on a &quot;verbal handshake&quot;, where they remained for years while he attempted to write and find backers for his adaptation. By 2006, Weide reluctantly announced that he had lost the rights. In April 2007, it was announced that screenwriter James V. Hart wrote an adaptation, which Vonnegut approved before he died.

On July 19, 2017, it was announced that the novel would be adapted as a TV series and would be directed by Dan Harmon, who will be collaborating with Evan Katz on the project.

==In popular culture== 
In a 1979 interview released in 2007, Douglas Adams discussed Vonnegut as an influence on &quot;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;:

<doc id="338188" wikidata="Q207788" url="?curid=338188" title="Earl Grey tea">
<text>Earl Grey tea is a tea blend which has been flavoured with oil of bergamot. The rind&#x27;s fragrant oil is added to black tea to give Earl Grey its unique taste. However, many if not most Earl Greys use artificial bergamot flavour.

Traditionally, Earl Grey was made from black teas such as Chinese keemun, and therefore intended to be served without milk. Sometimes it is blended with lapsang souchong tea, which lends a smoky character. Other varieties have been introduced as well, such as green or oolong.

==History==
The earliest reference to tea flavoured with bergamot dates to 1824; however the article in question makes no mention of Earl Grey. Bergamot seems to have been used to enhance the taste of low-quality teas. In 1837, charges were laid against a company accused of secretly adding bergamot to misrepresent their tea as a superior product and thus selling it at a higher price.

=== Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey ===

It has been suggested that the Earl Grey blend, or &quot;Earl Grey&#x27;s Mixture&quot;, may have been named after Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, British Prime Minister in the 1830s. However, the fact that adding bergamot to tea was being done in a disreputable manner near the time of his death suggests that, while it is possible that the second Earl Grey encountered tea flavoured with bergamot, it seems rather unlikely that he would have championed it. Nonetheless, there have been a number of theories attempting to link the tea to the earl.

One legend claims that a grateful Chinese mandarin, whose son was rescued from drowning by one of Lord Grey&#x27;s men, first presented the blend to the Earl in 1803. The tale appears to be apocryphal, as Lord Grey never travelled to China and the use of bergamot oil to scent tea was then unknown in China. However, this tale is subsequently told (and slightly corrected) on the Twinings website, as &quot;having been presented by an envoy on his return from China&quot;.

Another legend claims that he received as a gift, probably a diplomatic perquisite, tea flavoured with bergamot oil, perhaps as a result of his ending the monopoly held by the East India Company on trade between Britain and China.

According to the Grey family, the tea was specially blended by a Chinese mandarin for Lord Grey, to suit the water at Howick Hall, the family seat in Northumberland, using bergamot in particular to offset the preponderance of lime in the local water. Lady Grey used it to entertain in London as a political hostess, and it proved so popular that she was asked if it could be sold to others, which was how Twinings came to market it as a brand.

Jacksons of Piccadilly claim they originated Earl Grey&#x27;s Tea, Lord Grey having given the recipe to George Charlton, partner at Robert Jackson &amp; Co., in 1830. According to Jacksons, the original recipe has been in constant production and has never left their hands. Theirs has been based on Chinese black tea since the beginning.

=== Alternative theories ===

Other theories for the provenance of the tea suggest that its development had nothing to do with any Earl, and that the title was added at a later date.

References have been found in old advertisements dating to the 1850s and 1860s (after the death of the second Earl of Grey) to &quot;Grey&#x27;s Tea&quot; or &quot;Grey&#x27;s mixture&quot;, with the earliest being attributed to a tea merchant named William Grey in 1852. The first known published references to an &quot;Earl Grey&quot; tea are advertisements by Charlton &amp; Co. of Jermyn Street in London in the 1880s. It has been suggested that the &quot;Earl&quot; title was added to make the tea seem more posh, or alternately that it became associated with Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, who was alive when the &quot;Earl&quot; title began to be attributed to the tea.

=== Modern impressions ===

A 2010 survey found that a significant number of people in the United Kingdom associate drinking Earl Grey tea with being &quot;posh&quot; or &quot;middle class&quot;. Earl Grey tea has also been associated with Patrick Stewart&#x27;s character Jean-Luc Picard, introduced in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

==Preparation and variations==

&quot;Earl Grey&quot; as applied to tea is not a registered trademark, and numerous tea companies produce their own versions of Earl Grey tea, using a wide variety of tea leaves and additives.

Bergamot orange (&quot;Citrus bergamia&quot;), a probable hybrid of the lemon and bitter orange, is a small citrus tree which blossoms during the winter. It is grown extensively in Calabria, Italy, accounting for 90% of the world&#x27;s bergamot oil production.

Like other black teas, the tea leaves used in Earl Grey are green when harvested, and undergo oxidation during processing. This results in a change in their chemical composition, a darker colour, and a stronger flavour. Occasionally, green tea leaves or oolong leaves are used in place of the black tea leaves. When this is the case, the oxidation process is shortened or skipped. There are two methods of flavouring tea leaves to get Earl Grey tea. The first, which is said to result in a stronger citrus flavour, is the coating or spraying of the black tea leaves with bergamot essential oils. The second method is the addition of dried bergamot orange rinds to the Earl Grey tea blend. With this method, the citrus flavour infuses the black tea leaves during the brewing process.

The process of brewing the tea to drink it varies significantly, depending on personal preference. Opinions vary on the preferred method of boiling the water, as well as the ideal steeping time. Steeping tea for too long results in a bitter flavour; two to three minutes is a common recommendation, although some recommend as long as five minutes in order to &quot;enjoy the full benefit of the citrus aroma.&quot;
*There are different varieties of a tea known as Lady Grey; the two most common kinds are cornflower Lady Grey and citrus Lady Grey, which combine Earl Grey tea with cornflower and Seville oranges, respectively. &quot;Lady Grey&quot; is a trademark of Twinings.
*A beverage called &quot;London fog&quot; is a combination of Earl Grey, steamed milk and vanilla syrup.
*There are variations available including such ingredients as jasmine, as well as various flowers. A blend with added rose petals is known as French Earl Grey, which has become the most popular blend at Australian tea store T2.
*A variety called Russian Earl Grey often contains ingredients such as citrus peels and lemon grass in addition to the usual black tea and bergamot.
*A variety called Earl Grey Crème contains ingredients or flavours such as black tea, lavender, bergamot, and vanilla.
*Several companies make a tea called Earl Grey Green or &quot;Earl Green&quot; tea, replacing black tea with green tea leaves. A similar variation called Earl Grey White or &quot;Earl White&quot; tea combines white tea leaves with bergamot flavouring.
*Rooibos Earl Grey is a variation using this South African herbal tea as a substitute for black tea.
*Earl Grey milk tea is a popular boba tea flavoured drink in many Asian countries.

==Use as a flavouring==

Earl Grey tea is used as a flavouring for many types of cakes and confectionery, such as chocolates, as well as savoury sauces. Flavouring a sauce with tea is normally done by adding tea bags to the basic stock, boiling for a few minutes, and then discarding the bags. For sweet recipes, loose tea is often added to melted butter or hot cream and strained after the flavour is
infused.

==Tea research and possible drug interaction==

There is no conclusive evidence of any health effects specific to Earl Grey tea; consumption of black tea, which includes Earl Grey, may help improve alertness.

The caffeine in black tea may interfere with the intended therapeutic effects of various prescription drugs.
