<text>Frédéric Passy (20 May 182212 June 1912) was a French economist and pacifist who was a founding member of several peace societies and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He was also an author and politician, sitting in the Chamber of Deputies from 1881 until 1889. He was a joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 for his work in the European peace movement.

Born in Paris to a prominent Catholic and Orléanist family, Passy was surrounded by military veterans and politicians. After training in law, he worked as an accountant and served in the National Guard. He soon left this position and began travelling around France giving lectures on economics. Following years of violent conflicts across Europe, Passy joined the peace movement in the 1850s, working with several notable activists and writers to develop journals, articles, and educational curricula.

While sitting in the Chamber of Deputies, Passy developed the Inter-parliamentary Conference (later the Inter-Parliamentary Union) with British MP William Randal Cremer. Alongside this, he founded several peace societies: the , the , and the . Passy&#x27;s work in the peace movement continued into his later years, and in 1901, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Red Cross founder, Henry Dunant.

Passy died in 1912 after a long period of illness and incapacitation. Despite his economic works gaining little traction, his efforts in the peace movement resulted in him being recognised as the &quot;dean of European peace activists&quot;. His son, Paul Passy, published a memoir of his life in 1927, and his works are still being republished and translated into English in the 21st Century.

==Family and early life==

Passy was born in Paris in 1822 to an aristocratic Catholic family, which had strong ties to Orléanist politics.

His father, Justin Félix Passy, was a veteran of Waterloo. His paternal grandfather, Louis François Passy, had been (Receiver General of Finance), an important office in the Ancien Régime. His paternal grandmother was Jacquette Pauline Hélène d&#x27;Aure, whose brother, the Count d&#x27;Aure, was a riding master who fought for France in Egypt and Saint-Domingue.

Passy&#x27;s mother, Marie Louise Pauline Salleron, was from an aristocratic Parisian family. His maternal great-grandfather, Joseph Salleron, was deputy mayor of the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and his maternal grandfather, Claude Louis Salleron, created a highly-profitable tanning business and was proposed as an officer in the National Guard in 1814.

After getting married in 1821, Félix Passy moved into the family home with Claude Louis Salleron. They went into business with each other and Félix eventually became an equal partner. Frédéric Passy&#x27;s mother died in 1827, and in 1847, Félix married Irma Moricet, his son&#x27;s widowed mother-in-law.

===Early career===

From 1846, Passy worked as an accountant in the Conseil de Droit. In 1848, he served in the National Guard. He resigned from his Conseil position in 1849 to start a career as an economist.

He was unable to secure a full-time position in education; he refused to swear the mandatory oath of loyalty to French monarch Napoleon III, believing his rule to be illegitimate. However, Passy published several books on economics during this time, the majority of them compiled from his lectures at universities in Pau, Montpellier, Bordeaux, and Nice.

===Development of ideas===
Passy was trained in law, but soon became interested in moral and political economy. As he contemplated the effects of war, he was inspired by the works of several liberal economists and reformers: Frédéric Bastiat, Richard Cobden, and Daniel O&#x27;Connell. Passy was most impressed by Bastiat, who developed his ideas from Cobden&#x27;s Anti-Corn Law League. Bastiat held the belief that the conscription and high tax which often accompanied militarism had a largely negative effect on the poor, and Passy further developed these ideas on class conflict throughout his work.

Being raised in a family of military veterans, Passy described in his autobiography how he &quot;might easily have been drawn towards militarism&quot;. Instead, the stories about the horrors of the French conquest of Algeria pushed him to consider the effect that war had upon humanity. Years of violent discontent in Italy, Poland, and Austria and Prussia led to calls for a Europe federation from prominent liberals and socialists: Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Émile de Girardin, Passy, and Michel Chevalier were all advocates of this idea. In 1859, Passy condemned the idea that military action could be a solution to political issues, suggesting instead that Europe should have a &quot;permanent congress to oversee the general interests of humanity&quot; and an international police force.

Recognising the importance of journalism in the fight for peace, he conceived a plan to create a journal devoted to &quot;pacific propaganda&quot;. This led to him working with Edmond Potonié-Pierre on (&quot;The International Mail&quot;), an English/French periodical devoted to the European peace movement. Passy&#x27;s association with Potonié&#x27;s (League of Public Good), a liberal and socialist group aimed at attacking monopolies and high taxation, ended when Potonié began to call for a sweeping change in social policy. He advocated for the separation of church and state, a free press, equality of the sexes, the abolition of the death sentence.

==League of Peace==
===Founding the League===
In April 1867, the Paris newspaper &quot;Le Temps&quot; published three letters attacking the actions of the French concerning Luxembourg, the third of which was written by Passy. The letter invited readers to join a &quot;peace league&quot;, and was given enthusiastic support by:

Henry Richard, secretary of the Peace Society, visited Paris in that year and urged the Minister of the Interior to allow an international peace congress during the 1867 Paris Exposition. The idea was rejected, but the government eventually allowed lectures on the general principles of peace go ahead, with the condition that no questions were asked afterwards.

In May 1867, Passy and Chevalier received permission to organize the (International and Permanent League of Peace). It was in the that Passy declared &quot;war on war&quot;, believing that liberal economics would bring social change once military spending was eradicated. This differed greatly with the ideas of previous conservatives like Friedrich von Gentz, whose anti-war stance was concerned with maintaining the status quo.

On 21 May, Passy delivered a lecture at the (School of Medicine) in Paris, discussing his views on pacifism. He explained that his views were not from a religious or political perspective, but from an economic, moral, and philosophical one. While he did suggest that defensive or independence wars could be &quot;the most noble and magnificent task in life&quot;, he strongly condemned wars of conquest and expansion as disadvantageous to a country&#x27;s wealth and moral character.

In the same year, the French Saint-Simonian Charles Lemonnier founded a similarly named League in Geneva. This group was far more political than Passy&#x27;s, founded on republican views and strongly advocating for the separation of church and state. Passy made efforts to differentiate his from this one, repeating their &quot;anti-revolutionary aims&quot; and avoiding political questions over human rights.

Despite struggling to find adequate space for its 600 members, the held a meeting in June 1868 in which Passy gave a speech on the group&#x27;s &quot;anti-revolutionary&quot; aims:
===Franco-Prussian War===
The first large conflict to happen during the &#x27;s existence was the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. After the Battle of Sedan and capture of Napoleon III, Passy pleaded with the Prussian royalty to remember &quot;that you only made war to defend yourself, not to attack&quot; and stop attacking the French people after the collapse of their government. He returned to Paris and attempted to convince the British and American embassies to provide neutral intervention in the conflict, even considering travelling by hot air balloon to the Prussian king himself. On the death of his brother-in-law in the Vosges, Passy left Paris once again, disheartened that the could not stop the war.

===Opposition===
With Passy having adamantly renounced the earlier group, it is understandable that Edmond Potonié was one of the main opponents of the . He believed it not to be a serious peace society due to their vastly-differing opinions on the speed of change: he believed that only rapid societal change would bring about peace, whereas Passy&#x27;s group advocated a calmer legalistic approach. Other protest against the came from religious groups, with Hyacinthe Loyson being denounced by the right-wing journalist Louis Veuillot as part of a &quot;Protestant front&quot;: efforts to recruit more Catholics to the cause largely failed.

===Funding===
The received monetary support from notable liberals, such as John Stuart Mill (who joined on 4 August 1867) and Jean Dollfus. Subscription rates for its 600 members allowed the &#x27;s treasury to have six thousand francs in 1868: founding members paid roughly one hundred francs, while associates paid five francs.

==The Society of Friends of Peace==

After the &#x27;s collapse following the Franco-Prussian War, peace activism in Europe gained a rejuvenation after the successful arbitrations between Britain and the United States in Geneva. Daniël van Eyk, Philip Johannes Bachiene, and Samuel Baart de la Faille founded a Dutch group on the ideas behind Passy&#x27;s in 1871, and Masonic lodges began to undertake peace projects.

Passy noticed this renewed belief in peace, and in 1872 he began working on reviving the . He explained the two paths which society could take:
# A path of war and revenge against Prussia and the German Empire to restore Alsace-Lorraine, involving permanent armaments, a standing army, and a world where young men were doomed to a life in the barracks.
# A path of peace and law, where arbitration was a fundamental part of European governing and an organized international system would allow the return of &quot;lost provinces&quot; through diplomatic means like referendums.
He was aware that his favoured path, the latter, would not happen immediately or even in the near future, but set about creating a new French peace society to promote arbitration, the (French Society of Friends of Peace).

Several other groups considering arbitration and the development of international law appeared during this time, including the (Association for the Reform and the Codification of the Law of the People; later the International Law Association) in 1873, which Passy and Henry Richard were involved in. The meetings, involving discussions on ways to reduce friction among different communities, were a way to enhance the conversations that Passy thought important for developing international co-operation.

===1878 Paris Exposition===
Noticing the growth and popularity of the peace movement, members of the arranged a congress at the 1878 Paris Exposition, however they warned attendees not to raise &quot;unpleasant&quot; and provocative issues. 13 different nations were present among the 150 delegates, although 95 were from France. The congress was held across multiple days, involving a range of talks and speakers:
*Adolphe Franck, the French philosopher, opened the congress with an assertion that peace activism was beneficial for society. He argued that while war may previously have benefitted society, through creating communities and spreading culture, it was now nothing more than a cause of destruction and suffering.
*Charles Lemonnier reviewed the contributions of previous peace societies and opposed a motion that sought to create a transnational organisation or federation, stating the young age of the movement. The delegates ignored his advice, but he was seemingly correct as it took 13 more years to create such a group.
*As leader of the , Passy opposed a resolution which stated that war &quot;enthrones despotism and ... aggravates the condition of the most numerous and poorest classes&quot;. He rejected it on the grounds that war was damaging for all members of society, not just the poorest, and that within republics there is no class system. Lemonnier was among those who supported the resolution in the ensuing debate on class and the Paris Commune, but the conference sided with Passy&#x27;s view, refusing to recognise class as a social reality.
*Several of the congress&#x27;s speakers sought to convince it to create a permanent and legal body, including the French publicist Edmond Thiaudière, who argued that transnational representatives sitting in a parliament could work together to undermine the militarists in their countries. Arturo de Marcoartu, the Spanish peace activist, spoke in favour of a worldwide initiative to establish a European parliamentary system that would abolish war between its signatories.

The decade following the 1878 congress was a slow one for the , with Charles Richet noting that the meetings often consisted &quot;only of Passy, Thiaudière and [himself]&quot;.

===Merging===
In 1889, Passy&#x27;s merged with Hodgson Pratt&#x27;s International Arbitration and Peace Association to form the (French Society for Arbitration between Nations). This new lost its support in the 1890s to other groups, like the (Peace Through Law Association), which had been founded by a group of young Protestants.

==Political career==
On 28 April 1873, Passy ran for the Marseilles seat in the Chamber of Deputies as an independent conservative republican against the radical Édouard Lockroy. Passy lost with 17,000 votes compared to Lockroy&#x27;s 54,000. However, he was elected to the local council of Seine-et-Oise in 1874 and held the seat for twenty-four years.

In 1881, Passy was elected as the Deputy for the 8th arrondissement of Paris, beating a Bonapartist candidate. While in the Chamber, Passy continued to promote his views on peace. In October 1883, he led a discussion on the Tonkin campaign, attacking the government&#x27;s imperialist policy and suggesting that the conflict be subject to arbitration. His position was met with ridicule and he left the chamber for an extended period of illness. He returned to the issue in December 1885, denouncing the colonialist actions of France amid the &quot;remote prospect of any commercial results&quot; coming from the conflict. He criticised the government for affording rights to Alsace and Lorraine, but not to Tonkin and other colonies.

He often spoke against France&#x27;s corn duties, and in support of free trade, working alongside Finance Minister Léon Say to promote these free trade beliefs as part of the Association for the Defence of Commercial and Industrial Freedom. None of Passy&#x27;s initiatives within the chamber received legislative support, but his proposal that the state &quot;take advantage of all favourable occasions to enter into negotiations with other governments to promote the practice of arbitration&quot; was supported by 112 members from across vastly different parties.

Passy was re-elected to the Chamber in 1885. He ran again in 1889, and despite increasing his vote share in the weeks building up to the election, lost by 1,717 votes to Marius Martin.

===Inter-parliamentary Conference===

In 1887, Passy and British MP William Randal Cremer petitioned their respective parliaments to support arbitration treaties between their country and the United States. Passy amassed 112 signatures from French parliamentarians, supported in his efforts by Jules Simon and Georges Clemenceau. A year later in November 1888, Cremer led a delegation of nine MPs to meet with twenty-five French Deputies to discuss working together. This meeting formed the first Inter-parliamentary Conference (later the Inter-parliamentary Union) in 1889, attended by prominent politicians like Léon Bourgeois and Jean Jaures, with Passy serving as president

==Writing career==
Passy contributed to several different political magazines, including the feminist &#x27; (&quot;Review of Social Morale&quot;) and the literary-political &#x27; (&quot;Political and Literary Review&quot;). He published an autobiography in 1909, entitled (&quot;For the Peace: Notes and Documents&quot;).

In 1877, Passy was accepted into the (Academy of Moral and Political Sciences) for his works on political economy, and he was elected president of the (French Association for the Advancement of Sciences) in 1881. In his application to the , Passy avoided using the word &quot;peace&quot; and instead wrote:
===Peace through education===
Passy was aware of the importance of education in achieving peace, encouraging a textbook for nine-to-twelve-year-olds to be written. His group sponsored a prize essay in 1896 for this purpose. Passy and d&#x27;Estournelles de Constant worked together on a 1906 educational work, (&quot;Peace and Peace Education&quot;), and in 1909 released an entire curriculum entitled (&quot;Pacifist Teaching Course&quot;).

==Nobel Peace Prize==
Passy&#x27;s health had declined in old age, but he was still prominent and popular enough within the peace movement that it was assumed he would win the first Nobel Peace Prize. Public attention around the prize had increased to such a point that Passy was challenged to a duel by a man declaring that &quot;the Nobel Prize does not belong to you&quot;, but nothing further came from the incident.

In December 1901, Passy was awarded half of the first Nobel Peace Prize, which was split with Henry Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross, and each received over 100,000 francs.

Being too elderly and ill to attend the ceremony in Christiania (now Oslo), neither Passy or Dunant delivered an acceptance speech. Instead, Passy wrote an article to be released posthumously, criticising Alfred Nobel&#x27;s executors for using his money to create foundations he did not intend, and suggesting that the award could weaken the peace movement by attracting disingenuous money-seekers instead of peace-seekers. The article was published by the peace journal (&quot;Peace Through Law&quot;) in 1926. Despite Passy&#x27;s objections, Professor of History Sandi E. Cooper notes, the prize money was most likely used to fund his peace activism.

==Final years==
Passy continued to advocate for peace in his later years. In 1905, he attended the 14th Universal Peace Congress in Lucerne, during rising tensions between France and Germany. He defused tensions in the congress by crossing the floor and shaking hands with German pacifist Ludwig Quidde. A year later, he attended the 15th Universal Peace Congress in Milan, alongside delegates from across Europe and the United States like Felix Moscheles and Bertha von Suttner. Recognising the popularity of peace activism, Passy remarked in 1909 that &quot;the influence of these international [peace congresses] increases ... from year to year; it becomes more and more evident that they are taken seriously in the highest quarters&quot;.

Despite Passy&#x27;s fame, his economic doctrines failed to gather momentum among his countrymen.

==Illness and death==
In May 1912, celebrations had been prepared for Passy&#x27;s 90th birthday, but he was unable to attend due to his worsening health. He had intended to give an address at the celebrations, but it was later published in . Addressing his desire to &quot;lessen the evil in the world and increase the good&quot;, it ended with the words:

Passy spent his last months incapacitated in bed. On 12 June 1912, he died in Paris. His funeral was a simple one without &quot;flowers or pomp&quot;, the service being led by his friend, the Protestant pastor Charles Wagner.

==Religious and political views==
===Religion===
Passy was born into a Catholic family, regularly attending Mass and making friends with Ézy-sur-Eure&#x27;s priest while living there in the 1850s.

In 1870, Pope Pius IX&#x27;s First Vatican Council issued the , which legitimised Papal infallibility and solidified his word as divine. Passy could not accept this assertion of authority, and his family switched to a non-denominational, liberal Protestantism instead. Despite his Catholic background, he was supported by members of different denominations like the Protestant pastor Joseph Martin-Paschoud and Grand Rabbi Lazare Isidor. Passy&#x27;s son Paul suggested that he may have remained a &quot;liberal Catholic&quot; even after 1870, commenting on his close friendship with the radical Catholic priest Hyacinthe Loyson.

===Socialism===
While acknowledging their attendance at peace congresses, Passy disagreed with the violence that often accompanied the labour movement, considering it to be a hindrance to peace-seeking efforts. However, he did agree that socialists had &quot;some points, some very legitimate aspirations, that we would be wrong not to take into account&quot;.

In 1894, the Universal Peace Congress in Antwerp considered the ways in which members of the labour movement might be further involved with the peace movement, but Passy argued against such a co-operation. He denied any difference between social classes in a free and democratic society, and suggested that members of the labour movement join already-existing peace societies, instead of creating new society-aligned entities.

===Military service===
Despite serving in the National Guard, Passy disapproved of the idea of garrison life, believing that it led to laziness, gambling, and promiscuity. Instead, he suggested that the citizen-soldier would be a better idea:

Instead of being removed from society, they would be allowed to develop the &quot;military virtues&quot; within it.

While sitting in the Chamber, Passy advocated for a three-year obligatory term of service for all French citizens, but suggested that those adding to &quot;the intellectual grandeur of France&quot; may be allowed a shorter term.

===Disarmament===
When asked by young peace activists to support disarmament, Passy responded that:

He argued that it was impossible to disarm countries without first putting in place institutions that promoted international co-operation and arbitration.

===Apoliticism===
Like his non-denominational religious views, Passy was seemingly apolitical. He sat as an independent conservative republican, yet spoke often in support of libertarian policies like free trade economics.

In August 1898, Nicholas II of Russia published a rescript which called for an international conference to discuss a peace agenda. Passy saw this as proof that his neutral and apolitical brand of peacekeeping had worked, believing that leaders would see the negatives of an &quot;infinite arms race&quot; and work together across country lines.

==Marriage and issue==

In 1847, Passy married the wealthy Marie Blanche Sageret (1827–1900), the daughter of Jules Sageret and Marie Florence Irma Moricet. Their first son, Paul, was born in 1859. He became a famous linguist, known for founding the International Phonetic Association. Passy&#x27;s progressive views on European culture were influential towards his parenting: his son Paul learnt four languages as a child, yet never attended school. Another son, Jean, was born in 1866: he also became a linguist and preceded his brother as Secretary of the IPA.

Passy and Sageret also had a daughter called Marie Louise, whose husband Louis André Paulian was in charge of the Chamber of Deputies&#x27;s stenographic bureau. On 17 February 1912, Mathilde Paulian, the 20-year-old daughter of Marie and Louis, climbed over the railings of the Eiffel Tower observation deck and fell to her death, apparently upset over the ill health of her grandfather (Passy) and sister.

Alix, another daughter of Passy and Sageret, married Charles Mortet, an officer in the Legion of Honour.
In 1856, Passy acquired the estate in Chambourcy from Jean-François Bayard. A relative called Pierre Passy lived there in 1923, and the family owned the house until 1949.

===Family tree===





==Legacy==
Passy&#x27;s brand of peace through arbitration and international co-operation continued long after his death, with activists lobbying for formalised treaties over &quot;the rights of foreign visitors, joint access to waterways, settlement of territorial disputes&quot;. In his will, Passy expressed his independent and peaceful nature, writing:
In 1927, his son Paul published a memoir of his father&#x27;s life entitled .

Several roads have been named after Passy, such as those in Nice, Neuilly-sur-Seine, and Saint-Germain-en-Laye. In March 2004, the Inter-parliamentary Union acknowledged Passy&#x27;s effort in its creation and inaugurated the Frédéric Passy Archive Centre in Paris.

<text>Camp Nelson Confederate Cemetery is a historic cemetery located near Cabot in northern Lonoke County, Arkansas and is near the site of a Confederate military camp Camp Hope (renamed Camp Nelson), where 1,500 Confederate soldiers died during an epidemic during the fall of 1862. Camp Nelson Cemetery is located on Rye Drive, just off Cherry Road, just off Mt. Carmel Road in north Lonoke County about 2 miles east of Cabot.

==History==

Camp Hope was established in the spring of 1862 as a central staging point in central Arkansas for Confederate troops gathering from Texas and Arkansas. The camp was renamed for Brigadier General Allison Nelson, commander of the 10th Texas Infantry Regiment, after he died there in October 1862.

During the fall of 1862, an epidemic of measles, typhoid fever, mumps, and other diseases ran rampant through the troops congregated there. Brigadier General Nelson was among the approximately 1,500 Arkansas and Texas soldiers who died from disease-related conditions during a two-month period, from early October to early December. The majority of these soldiers were buried in unmarked graves in the surrounding area. The camp was abandoned by the end of 1862.
In 1905, Confederate veterans located 429 graves and reinterred the remains on land donated for a cemetery near the original camp site. They placed 429 limestone markers, all marked &quot;Unknown Soldier CSA&quot;, and erected a 12-foot obelisk to memorialize those buried here. Improperly maintained after the death of the last Civil War Veterans, the site was ultimately overtaken by forest undergrowth.

The cemetery was reclaimed before the end of the century, however, after local high school teachers, members of the Cabot High School Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, Future Farmers of America students, and other area residents embarked on a restoration project during the 1980s with state funding. Renovations included clearing and leveling the land, replacing the fence and gate, and replacing the markers with new United States government headstones. The state appropriation for upkeep ended in the late 1990s leaving the cemetery maintenance up to interested residents. The Camp Nelson Confederate Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

<doc id="323089" wikidata="Q21062" url="?curid=323089" title="Common murre">
<text>The common murre or common guillemot (Uria aalge) is a large auk. It has a circumpolar distribution, occurring in low-Arctic and boreal waters in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. It spends most of its time at sea, only coming to land to breed on rocky cliff shores or islands.

Common murres are fast in direct flight but are not very agile. They are highly mobile underwater using their wings to &#x27;fly&#x27; through the water column, where they typically dive to depths of . Depths of up to have been recorded.

Common murres breed in colonies at high densities. Nesting pairs may be in bodily contact with their neighbours. They make no nest; their single egg is incubated between the adult&#x27;s feet on a bare rock ledge on a cliff face. Eggs hatch after ~30 days incubation. The chick is born downy and can regulate its body temperature after 10 days. Some 20 days after hatching, the chick leaves its nesting ledge and heads for the sea, unable to fly, but gliding for some distance with fluttering wings, accompanied by its male parent. Male guillemots spend more time diving, and dive more deeply than females during this time. Chicks are capable of diving as soon as they hit the water. The female stays at the nest site for some 14 days after the chick has left.

Both male and female common murres moult after breeding and become flightless for 1–2 months. Some populations have short migration distances, instead remaining close to the breeding site year-round. Such populations return to the nest site from autumn onwards. Adult birds balance their energetic budgets during the winter by reducing the time that they spend flying and are able to forage nocturnally.

==Taxonomy==
The common murre was formally described and illustrated in 1763 by the Danish bishop Erik Pontoppidan under the binomial name &quot;Colymbus aalge&quot;. The type locality is Iceland. The species is now placed together with the thick-billed murre in the genus &quot;Uria&quot; that was described in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;ouria&quot;, a waterbird mentioned by Athenaeus. The specific epithet &quot;aalge&quot; is an old Danish word for an auk.

The auks are a family of seabirds related to the gulls and terns which contains several genera. The common murre is placed in the guillemot (murre) genus &quot;Uria&quot; (Brisson, 1760), which it shares with the thick-billed murre or Brunnich&#x27;s guillemot, &quot;U. lomvia&quot;. These species, together with the razorbill, little auk and the extinct great auk make up the tribe Alcini. This arrangement was originally based on analyses of auk morphology and ecology.

The official common name for this species is Common Murre according to the IOC World Bird List, Version 11.2. while Common Guillemot is used in the UK, Ireland, and often elsewhere in Europe where English is used as a second language.

Five subspecies are now recognised:
* &quot;U. a. aalge&quot; (Pontoppidan, 1763) – coastal southeast Canada, southwest Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Scotland, south Norway and Baltic Sea. Includes &quot;intermedia&quot; and &quot;spiloptera&quot;.
* &quot;U. a. hyperborea&quot; Salomonsen, 1932 – coastal north Norway to Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya (northwest Russia)
* &quot;U. a. albionis&quot; Witherby, 1923 – coastal British Isles, Heligoland (north of Germany), northwest France and west Iberian Peninsula
* &quot;U. a. inornata&quot; Salomonsen, 1932 – coastal Kamchatka Peninsula, Sakhalin, Kuril and Commander Islands (east Russia), south Kuril Islands (north Japan), Teuri Island (northwest of Hokkaido; formerly also Hokkaido; north Japan); Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea islands to west Alaska and southwest Canada
* &quot;U. a. californica&quot; (Bryant, H, 1861) – coastal north Washington to south California (east North Pacific)

==Etymology==
The spelling &quot;guillemot&quot; is of French origin, first attested by Pierre Belon in 1555, but derived from Old (11th century) French &quot;willelm&quot;, and matched by English variants &quot;willock&quot; (attested 1631), &quot;willick&quot;, &quot;will&quot; and &quot;wilkie&quot;, all from forms of the name William, cf. , but ultimately onomatopoeic from the loud, high-pitched &quot;&quot;will&quot;, &quot;willem&quot;&quot; begging calls of the newly fledged young of the common guillemot. The American name &quot;murre&quot;, also known from England (particularly Cornwall) from the 17th century, is by contrast, onomatopoeic of the growling call of adult common guillemots.

==Description==
The common murre is in length with a wingspan. Male and female are indistinguishable in the field and weight ranges between in the south of their range and in the north. A weight range of has been reported. In breeding plumage, the nominate subspecies &quot;U. a. aalge&quot; is black on the head, back and wings, and has white underparts. It has a thin dark pointed bill and a small rounded black tail. After the post-breeding moult, the face is white with a dark spur behind the eye, and there are often dark streaks on the flanks. Birds of the subspecies &quot;U. a. albionis&quot; are dark brown rather than black, most obviously so in colonies in southern Britain. The legs and the bill are dark grey. Occasionally, adults have been seen with yellow-grey legs. In May 2008, an aberrant adult was photographed with a bright yellow bill.

The adults moult into breeding plumage in December–February, even starting as early as November in &quot;U. a. albionis&quot;, and back into winter plumage soon after leaving the breeding colonies in July to August. The plumage of first winter birds is the same as the adult winter plumage. However, their moult into first summer plumage occurs later in the year than in adults. First year birds often remain in winter plumage as late as May, and their first summer plumage usually retains some white feathers around the throat.

Some individuals in the North Atlantic, known as &quot;bridled guillemots&quot;, have a white ring around the eye extending back as a white line. This is not a distinct subspecies, but a polymorphism that becomes more common the farther north the birds breed.

The chicks are downy with blackish feathers on top and white below. By 12 days old, contour feathers are well developed in areas except for the head. At 15 days, facial feathers show the dark eyestripe against the white throat and cheek. They jump from the breeding cliffs at 20–21 days old, long before being fully fledged, and are cared for by the male parent at sea.

The common murre has a variety of calls, including a soft purring noise, but the main call of the adults, often deafening at large colonies, is a growling &quot;murrrr&quot;; the chicks have a food-begging call, a high-pitched whistle &quot;willee&quot;, with considerable carrying power.
===Flight===
The common murre flies with fast wing beats and has a flight speed of . Groups of birds are often seen flying together in a line just above the sea surface. However, a high wing loading of 2 g/cm2 means that this species is not very agile and take-off is difficult. Common murres become flightless for 45–60 days while moulting their primary feathers. The sound of the wing beats of the murres are often described as similar to a helicopter.

===Diving===

The common murre is a pursuit-diver that forages for food by swimming underwater using its wings for propulsion. Dives usually last less than one minute, but the bird swims underwater for distances of over on a regular basis. Diving depths up to have been recorded, and birds can remain underwater for a couple of minutes.

==Distribution and habitat==

The breeding habitat is islands, rocky shores, cliffs and sea stacks. The population is large, perhaps 7.3 million breeding pairs or 18 million individuals. It had been stable, but in 2016 a massive die-off of the birds in the northeast Pacific was reported. The birds seem emaciated and starving; no etiology has been found. In general, potential threats include excessive hunting (legal in Newfoundland), pollution and oil spills. Cape Meares, Oregon is home to one of the most populous colonies of nesting common murres on the North American continent.

Some birds are permanent residents; northern birds migrate south to open waters near New England, southern California, Japan, Korea and the western Mediterranean. UK populations are generally distributed near their breeding colonies year-round, but have been found to make long-distance migrations as far north as the Barents Sea. Common murres rest on the water in the winter and this may have consequences for their metabolism. In the black-legged kittiwake (which shares this winter habit) resting metabolism is 40% higher on water than it is in air.

A marine heat wave killed off half the murre population in Alaska between 2014 and 2016, and as of 2024 the species has yet to recover.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
The common murre can venture far from its breeding grounds to forage; distances of and more are often observed though if sufficient food is available closer by, birds only travel much shorter distances. The common murre mainly eats small schooling forage fish long or less, such as polar cod, capelin, sand lances, sprats, sandeels, Atlantic cod and Atlantic herring. Capelin and sand lances are favourite food, but what the main prey is at any one time depends much on what is available in quantity. It also eats some molluscs, marine worms, squid, and crustaceans such as amphipods. It consumes of food in a day on average. It is often seen carrying fish in its bill with the tail hanging out.

The snake pipefish is occasionally eaten, but it has poor nutritional value. The amount of these fish is increasing in the common murre&#x27;s diet. Since 2003, the snake pipefish has increased in numbers in the North-east Atlantic and North Sea and sandeel numbers have declined.

===Breeding===
====Colonies====

The common murre nests in densely packed colonies (known as &quot;loomeries&quot;), with up to twenty pairs occupying one square metre at peak season. Common murres do not make nests and lay their eggs on bare rock ledges, under rocks, or the ground. Despite the high density of murre breeding sites, sites may vary greatly in their quality over small spatial scales. Pairs breeding at those sites of highest quality are more likely to be occupied by a breeding pairs at all population sizes, and more likely to successfully fledge a chick. They first breed at four to nine years old, but most individuals recruit into the breeding population at ages six or seven, although birds may disperse (permanently depart their natal colony) if space is limited. Annual survival probability for birds aged 6–15 is 0.895, and average lifespan is about 20 years. Breeding success increases with age up to age 9–10 to 0.7 fledglings per pair, then declines in the oldest age birds, perhaps indicating reproductive senescence.

High densities mean that birds are close contact with neighbouring breeders. Common murres perform appeasement displays more often at high densities and more often than razorbills. Allopreening is common both between mates and between neighbours. Allopreening helps to reduce parasites, and it may also have important social functions. Frequency of allopreening a neighbour correlates well with current breeding success. Allopreening may function as a stress-reducer; ledges with low levels of allopreening show increased levels of fighting and reduced breeding success.

====Courtship====
Courtship displays including bowing, billing and mutual preening. The male points its head vertically and makes croaking and growling noises to attract the females. The species is monogamous, but pairs may split if breeding is unsuccessful.

====Eggs and incubation====

Common murre eggs are large (around 11% of female weight), and are pointed at one end. The egg&#x27;s shape is popularly ascribed the function of allowing the egg to spin on its axis or in an arc when disturbed, however there is no evidence to support this claim. Various hypotheses have arisen to explain the egg&#x27;s shape:
# Pyriform eggs are more stable on a sloping surface than more elliptical eggs, such as that of the razorbill.
# The shape allows efficient heat transfer during incubation.
# As a compromise between large egg size and small cross-section. Large size allows quick development of the chick. Small cross-sectional area allows the adult bird to have a small cross-section and therefore reduce drag when swimming.
# Due to its pyriform shape, a higher proportion of the eggshell is in contact with the cliff minimising the effects of impact by neighbouring birds. 
# It helps to confine faecal contamination to the pointy end of the egg. The blunt end, where the embryo&#x27;s head and air cell are located, is kept relatively free of debris, allowing gases to pass through the shell unimpeded;.

Eggs are laid between May and July for the Atlantic populations and March to July for those in the Pacific. The female spends less time ashore during the two weeks before laying. When laying, she assumes a &quot;phoenix-like&quot; posture: her body raised upright on vertical tarsi; wings half outstretched. The egg emerges point first and laying usually takes 5–10 minutes.
The eggs vary in colour and pattern to help the parents recognize them, each egg&#x27;s pattern being unique. Colours include white, green, blue or brown with spots or speckles in black or lilac. After laying, the female will look at the egg before starting the first incubation shift. Both parents incubate the egg using a single, centrally located brood patch for the 28 to 34 days to hatching in shifts of 1–38 hours.

Eggs can be lost due to predation or carelessness. Crows and gulls are opportunist egg thieves. Eggs are also knocked from ledges during fights. If the first egg is lost, the female may lay a second egg. This egg is usually lighter than the first, with a lighter yolk. Chicks from second eggs grow quicker than those from first eggs. However this rapid growth comes at a cost, first chicks have larger fat reserves and can withstand temporary shortages of food.

====Growth of the chick====
Chicks occupy an intermediate position between the precocial chicks of genus &quot;Synthliboramphus&quot; and the semi-precocial chicks of the Atlantic puffin. They are born downy and by 10 days old they are able to regulate their own temperature. Except in times of food shortage there is at least one parent present at all times, and both parents are present 10–30% of the time. Both parents alternate between brooding the chick or foraging for food.
Provisioning is usually divided equally between each parent, but unequal provisioning effort can lead to divorce. Common murres are &quot;single-prey loaders&quot;, this means that they carry one fish at time. The fish is held lengthways in the adult&#x27;s bill, with the fish&#x27;s tail hanging from the end of the beak. The returning adult will form its wings into a &#x27;tent&#x27; to protect the chick. The adult points its head downwards and the chick swallows the fish head first.

Alloparenting behaviour is frequently observed. Non-breeding and failed breeders show great interest in other chicks, and will attempt to brood or feed them. This activity is more common as the chicks get older and begin to explore their ledge. There has also been a record of a pair managing to raise two chicks. Adults that have lost chicks or eggs will sometimes bring fish to the nest site and try to feed their imaginary chick.

At time of extreme food stress, the social activity of the breeding ledge can break down. On the Isle of May colony in 2007, food availability was low. Adults spent more of their time-budget foraging for their chicks and had to leave them unattended at times. Unattended chicks were attacked by breeding neighbour which often led to their deaths. Non-breeding and failed breeders continued to show alloparental care.

The chicks will leave the nest after 16 to 30 days (average 20–22 days), and glide down into the sea, slowing their fall by fluttering as they are not yet able to fly. Chicks glide from heights as high as to the water below. Once the young chick has left the nest, the male is in close attendance for up to two months. The chicks are able to fly roughly two weeks after fledging. Up until then the male feeds and cares for the chick at sea. In its migration south the chick swims about . The female remains at the nest site for up to 36 days after the chick has fledged (average 16 days).

==Relationship with humans==
===Pollution===
Major oil spills double the winter mortality of breeding adults but appear to have little effect on birds less than three years old. This loss of breeding birds can be compensated by increased recruitment of 4–6 year olds to breeding colonies.

===Recreational disturbance===
Nesting common murres are prone to two main sources of recreational disturbance: rock-climbing and birdwatching. Sea cliffs are a paradise for climbers as well as birds; a small island like Lundy has over 1000 described climbing routes. To minimise disturbance, some cliffs are subject to seasonal climbing bans.

Birdwatching has conflicting effects on common murres. Birdwatchers petitioned the UK government to introduce the Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869. This act was designed to reduce the effects of shooting and egg collecting during the breeding season. Current concerns include managing the effect of visitor numbers at wildlife reserves. Common murres have been shown to be sensitive to visitor numbers.

===Seabirds as indicators of marine health===
When common murres are feeding their young, they return with one fish at a time. The provisioning time relates to the distance of the feeding areas from the colony and the numbers of available fish. There is a strong non-linear relationship between fish density and colony attendance during chick-rearing.

===As a food source===
In areas such as Newfoundland and Labrador, the birds, along with the related thick-billed murre, are referred to as &#x27;turrs&#x27; or &#x27;tuirs&#x27;, and are consumed. The meat is dark and quite oily, due to the birds&#x27; diet of fish. Eggs have also been harvested. Eggers from San Francisco took almost half a million eggs a year from the Farallon Islands in the mid-19th century to feed the growing city.

=== Mass mortality in global warming ===
A 2024 study in the journal &quot;Science&quot; has reported that an extreme marine heatwave has killed approximately half of Alaska’s Common murre. Between the 7-year period before (2008–2014) and after (2016–2022) the heatwave, murre numbers plummeted 52 to 78% at 13 colonies, lost 4.00 million common murres, which is the largest documented wildlife mortality event in the modern era. No evidence of recovery has yet been observed.

<doc id="323090" wikidata="Q190632" url="?curid=323090" title="Centralisation">
<text>Centralisation or centralization (North American English; see English spelling differences) is the process by which the activities of an organisation, particularly those regarding planning, decision-making, and framing strategies and policies, become concentrated within a particular group within that organisation. This creates a power structure where the said group occupies the highest level of hierarchy and has significantly more authority and influence over the other groups, who are considered its subordinates.

An antonym of &quot;centralisation&quot; is &quot;decentralisation&quot;, where authority is shared among numerous different groups, allowing varying degree of autonomy for each.

The term has a variety of meanings in several fields. In political science, centralisation refers to the concentration of a government&#x27;s power—both geographically and politically—into a centralised government, which has sovereignty over all its administrative divisions. Conversely, a decentralised system of government often has significant separation of powers and local self-governance.

==Centralisation in politics==

===History of the centralisation of authority===
&quot;Centralisation of authority&quot; is the systematic and consistent concentration of authority at a central point or in a person within the organization. This idea was first introduced in the Qin dynasty of China. The Qin government was highly bureaucratic and was administered by a hierarchy of officials, all serving the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang. The Qin dynasty practised all the things that Han Feizi taught, allowing Qin Shi Huang to own and control all his territories, including those conquered from other countries. Zheng and his advisers ended feudalism in China by setting up new laws and regulations under a centralised and bureaucratic government with a rigid centralisation of authority.

===Features of centralisation of authority in ancient Chinese government===
* In the ancient Chinese government, the monarchical power was the supreme power in the empire. The emperor monopolised all the resources in the country; his personality and abilities decide the prosperity of the country. This autocratic system allows for faster decision-making and avoids complex solutions to problems that arise. One disadvantage is that courtiers, who compete for the emperor&#x27;s favor, could amass power for themselves, leading to internal strife. (Jin and Liu, 1992)
* The administrative department had highly centralised powers. The duties of each bureaucratic occupation were not clearly defined, leading to inefficiencies as functionaries managed the government and effectively ruled the country.

===Idea of centralisation of authority===

The acts for the implementation are needed after delegation. Therefore, the authority for taking the decisions can be spread with the help of the delegation of the authority.

The centralisation of authority can be done immediately, if complete concentration is given at the decision-making stage for any position. The centralisation can be done with a position or at a level in an organisation. Ideally, the decision-making power is held by a few individuals.

===Advantages and disadvantages of the centralisation of authority===
Centralisation of authority has several advantages and disadvantages. The benefits include:

# Responsibilities and duties are well defined within the central governing body.
# Decision-making is very direct and clear.
# The central power maintains a large &quot;encompassing interest&quot; in the welfare of the state it rules since it stands to benefit from any increase in the state&#x27;s wealth and/or power. In this sense, the incentives of state and ruler are aligned.

Disadvantages, on the other hand are as follows:

# Decisions may be misunderstood while being passed on and lower position departments do not have the decision-making power, therefore it requires an efficient and well-organised top department.
# Attention and support for each department or city may not be balanced.
# Delay of work information may result in inefficiency of the government.
# Discrepancies in the economy and information resources between the centre and other places are significant.
# Excludes actors at the local and provincial levels from the prevailing system of governance, reducing the capacity of the central government to hold the authority accountable (with risks of corruption), resolve disputes or design effective policies requiring local knowledge and expertise.

==Centralisation in economy==

===Relationship between centralisation (i.e. concentration of production) and capitalism===

As written in V.I. Lenin’s book, &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot;, &quot;The remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism.&quot; He researched the development of production and decided to develop the concept of production as a centralised framework, from individual and scattered small workshops into large factories, leading the capitalism to the world. This is guided by the idea that once concentration of production develops into a particular level, it will become a monopoly, like party organisations of Cartel, Syndicate, and Trust.
* Cartel - In economics, a cartel is an agreement between competing firms to control prices or exclude entry of a new competitor in a market. It is a formal organisation of sellers or buyers that agree to fix selling prices, purchase prices, or reduce production using a variety of tactics.
* Syndicate - A syndicate is a self-organising group made up of individuals, companies, corporations or entities formed to transact some specific business, to pursue or promote a shared interest.
*Trust - &quot;A trust is ... simply the case of one person holding the title of property, whether land or chattels, for the benefit of another, termed a beneficiary. Nothing can be more common or more useful. But the word is now loosely applied to a certain class, of commercial agreements and, by reason of a popular and unreasoning dread of their effect, the term itself has become contaminated.&quot;

==Centralisation in business studies==

Most businesses deal with issues relating to the specifics of centralisation or decentralisation of decision-making. The key question is either whether the authority should manage all the things at the centre of a business (centralised), or whether it should be delegated far away from the centre (decentralised).

The choice between centralised or decentralised varies. Many large businesses necessarily involve some extent of decentralisation and some extent of centralisation when it begins to operate from several places or any new units and markets added.

According to a 2021 study, &quot;firms that delegated more power from the central headquarters to local plant managers prior to the Great Recession outperformed their centralised counterparts in sectors that were hardest hit by the subsequent crisis.&quot;

===Features of centralisation in management===
# Top level managers concentrate and reserve the decision-making power.
# Execution decided by the top level management with the help from the other levels of management.
# Lower levels management do their jobs under direct control of the top managers.

<text>Louis Renault (21 May 1843 – 8 February 1918) was a French jurist and educator, and the co-winner in 1907 (with Ernesto Teodoro Moneta) of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Renault was born at Autun. From 1868 to 1873, Renault was professor of Roman and commercial law at the University of Dijon. From 1873 until his death, he was professor in the faculty of law at the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) and the University of Paris, where in 1881 he became professor of international law. In 1890, he was appointed jurisconsult of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a post created for him in which he scrutinized French foreign policy in the light of international law. He served at numerous conferences in this capacity, notably at the two Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907) and the London Naval Conference (1908–1909).

Renault was prominent as an arbitrator, his more famous cases including the Japanese House Tax case of 1905, the Casa Blanca Case of 1909, the Sarvarkar Case of 1911, the Carthage case of 1913, and the Manouba case of 1913. Among his writings are articles and monographs on the specialized topics of international law. Together with his friend and colleague C. Lyon-Caen, he produced several works on commercial law, including a compendium in two volumes, a treatise in eight volumes, and a manual that ran to many editions.

In 1879, Renault published his Introduction to the Study of International Law and in 1917 First Violations of International Law by Germany, concerning the invasion of Belgium and of Luxembourg in breach of Germany&#x27;s treaty obligations.

<text>Freedom of religion in Afghanistan changed during the Islamic Republic installed in 2002 following a U.S.-led invasion that displaced the former Taliban government.

Freedom of religion has changed again after the Taliban took back control in August 2021.

==Overview==
The initial three articles of the Constitution of Afghanistan dated January 23, 2004, mandated:

:# Afghanistan shall be an Islamic Republic, independent, unitary, and indivisible state.
:# The sacred religion of Islam shall be the religion of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Followers of other faiths shall be free within the bounds of law in the exercise and performance of their religious rights.
:# No law shall contravene the tenets and provisions of the holy religion of Islam in Afghanistan.

Article seven of the constitution commits the state to abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other international treaties and conventions to which the country is a party. Articles 18 and 19 of the UDHR, taken together, effectively declare that it is a universal human right to engage in religious proselytism.

In the past, small communities of Hindus, Sikhs, Jews, and Christians also lived in the country; most members of these communities have left. Even at their peak, these non-Muslim minorities constituted only one percent of the population. Almost all members of the country&#x27;s small Hindu and Sikh population, which once numbered about 50,000, have emigrated or taken refuge abroad. Non-Muslims such as Hindus and Sikhs now number only in the hundreds, often working as traders. The few Christians and Jews who live in the country are mostly foreigners who are in the country to carry out relief work on behalf of foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

==Freedom of Religion before November 2001==
===History===

The Taliban imposed its interpretation of Islamic law, establishing a &quot;Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice&quot; for purposes of enforcement. One of the Ministry&#x27;s duties was to operate a body of religious police who enforced edicts on dress code, employment, access to medical care, behavior, religious practice, and expression. Persons found to be in violation of an edict were often subject to punishment meted out on the spot, which included beatings and detention.

The Taliban persecuted members of other Islamic sects as well as non-Muslims. Traditionally, Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence has been the dominant form of Islam in Afghanistan. This school counts the Taliban among its followers. The Deoband madrassa (religious school) near Delhi, India, has been a source of influence for these Sunni for approximately 200 years. Most of the Taliban leadership attended Deobandi-influenced seminaries in Pakistan. The Deoband school has long sought to &quot;purify&quot; Islam by discarding supposedly un-Islamic accretions to the faith and reemphasizing the models established in the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith. Deobandi scholars often have opposed what they perceive as Western influences. Much of the population adheres to Deobandi-influenced Hanafi Sunnism, but a sizable minority adheres to a more mystical version of Hanafi Sunnism generally known as Sufism. Sufism centers on orders or brotherhoods that follow charismatic religious leaders.

The Shi&#x27;a, under the Taliban, were among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country. An ethnic group known as the Hazara is predominantly Shi&#x27;a Muslim. There are also are small numbers of Ismailis living in the central and northern parts of the country. Ismailis are Shi&#x27;a Muslims, but consider the Aga Khan their spiritual leader.

==Freedom of speech, including on religious matters==
The Taliban prohibited free speech about religious issues or discussions that challenge orthodox Sunni Muslim views. Publishing and distribution of literature of any kind, including religious material, was rare. In 1998, television sets, videocassette recorders, videocassettes, audiocassettes, and satellite dishes were outlawed in order to enforce the prohibition. However, subsequent reports indicated that many persons in urban areas around the country continued to own such electronic devices despite the ban. The Taliban continues to prohibit music, movies, and television on religious grounds in areas that it still holds.

===Religious discrimination===
====Discrimination against non-Muslims====

According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), in September 1998, the Taliban issued decrees that forbade non-Muslims from building new places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites, criticizing Muslims and living in the same residence as Muslims, as well as ordering non-Muslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops and requiring non-Muslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that Muslims could keep their distance.

The constitution limits the political rights of Afghanistan&#x27;s non-Muslims, and only Muslims are allowed to become the President.

====Discrimination against Sikhs====
In May 2001, according to news reports, the Taliban considered an edict requiring Sikhs to wear identifying badges on their clothing. On May 23, 2001, Taliban radio announced that the edict was approved by religious officials. However, Mullah Omar reportedly did not sign the edict and it was not implemented by the Taliban. Not only Sikhs were discriminated but their own religion people were also discriminated because of caste system of that period.

===Discrimination against Hazara Shia Muslims===
Repression by the Taliban of the Hazara ethnic group, which is majorly Shia Muslim, was particularly severe. The Taliban have been accused of committing mass killings of the Hazaras particularly in the north. It has been claimed that the Taliban massacred thousands of civilians and prisoners during and after the capture of Mazar-i-Sharif in August 1998.

Besides claims of genocide, there are claims of forced expulsions of ethnic Hazaras and Tajiks from areas controlled or conquered by the Taliban, as well as harassment of these minorities throughout Taliban-controlled areas.

===Freedom to proselytize===
A small number of foreign Christian groups were allowed in the country to provide humanitarian assistance; however, they were forbidden by the Taliban to proselytize. A June 2001 decree stated that proselytizing by non-Muslims was punishable by death or deportation in the case of foreigners. Taliban officials subsequently stated that the decree was only a guideline.

On August 3, 2001, Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer were arrested by the Taliban along with 22 others for their work with &quot;Shelter Now&quot;, a Christian aid organization based in Germany. The Taliban also seized Bibles and videos and audio tapes from the members of the group. The workers were tried for violating the Taliban prohibition against proselytizing. On November 15, 2001, Curry and Mercer were freed by Operation Enduring Freedom forces, after the Taliban had fled Kabul.

===Freedom to practice a religion===
Prayer was mandatory for all, and those found not praying at appointed times or who were late attending prayer were punished, often by severe beatings. There were reports in 1998 that Ministry members in Kabul stopped persons on the street and demanded that they recite various Koranic prayers in order to determine the extent of their religious knowledge and sometimes they were forced to follow a particular religion and if refuses so they were treated badly and forced to work. There were many cases in which women were also treated badly if they were of other religion and if they also follow Islam then also they were considered prior then mans and not given equal rights .

=== Destruction of Buddha statues ===
In March 2001, the Taliban destroyed two giant pre-Islamic Buddha statues carved into cliffs in Bamiyan province, on the grounds that statues were idolatrous. The Taliban destroyed the statues despite appeals from the United Nations, international NGOs, and the world community, including many Muslim countries, to preserve the two-thousand-year-old statues.

==Freedom of Religion between November 2001 to September 2021==
In November 2001 the Taliban was taken out of power. However, political instability meant that human rights and religious freedom were slow to improve. A report in 2021 noted that despite some changes in government and society, the small communities of religious minorities (including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims and Baha&#x27;is) remained endangered, without the ability to observe their faith publicly for fear of violent reprisal.

A Pew Forum data report in 2009 stated that Sunni Muslims constituted 80-85% of the population, with Shia Muslims making up 10-15%. Other religious groups, mainly Hindus, Sikhs, Baha&#x27;is and Christians, together constitute less than 0.3 percent of the population. There were a few hundred Ahmadiyya Muslims and no Jews in the country.

In March 2015, a 27-year-old Afghan woman was murdered by a mob in Kabul over false allegations of burning a copy of the Qur&#x27;an. After beating and kicking Farkhunda Malikzada, the mob threw her over a bridge, set her body on fire and threw it in the river.

==Freedom of Religion after 2021==

The Taliban took back power in Sept 2021. A report in 2022 report noted that they had stated that the country is an Islamic emirate whose laws and governance must be consistent with sharia law. Sikhs, Hindus, Christians, and other non-Muslim minorities reported continued harassment from Muslims. Baha&#x27;is and Christians continued to live in constant fear of exposure.

In 2022, Freedom House rated Afghanistan&#x27;s religious freedom as 1 out of 4.

In 2023, it was reported that violations against minorities had increased after September 2021. In particular, religious, sectarian, and ethnic minorities including Shia Hazaras and Ahmadis had fled to neighbouring countries such as Iran and Pakistan.

<doc id="323103" wikidata="Q20937" url="?curid=323103" title="Gyeonggi Province">
<text>Gyeonggi Province (, ) is the most populous province in South Korea.

Seoul, the nation&#x27;s largest city and capital, is in the heart of the area but has been separately administered as a provincial-level &quot;special city&quot; since 1946. Incheon, the nation&#x27;s third-largest city, is on the coast of the province and has been similarly administered as a provincial-level &quot;metropolitan city&quot; since 1981. The three jurisdictions are collectively referred to as &quot;Sudogwon&quot; and cover , with a combined population of over 26 million - amounting to over half (50.25%) of the entire population of South Korea at the 2020 census.

== Etymology ==
Its name, &quot;Gyeonggi&quot;, means &quot;京 (the capital) and 畿 (the surrounding area)&quot;. Thus, &quot;Gyeonggi Province&quot; can be translated as &quot;Seoul and the surrounding areas of Seoul&quot;.

==History==

Gyeonggi Province has been a politically important area since 18 BCE, when Korea was divided into three nations during the Three Kingdoms period. Ever since King Onjo, the founder of Baekje (one of the three kingdoms), founded the government in Wiryeseong of Hanam, the Han River Valley was absorbed into Goguryeo in the mid-fifth century, and became Silla&#x27;s territory in the year 553 (the 14th year of King Jinheung). Afterward, the current location of Gyeonggi Province, one of the nine states of Later Silla, was called Hansanju.

The Gyeonggi region started to rise as the central region of Goryeo as King Taejo of Goryeo (the kingdom following Silla) set up the capital in Gaesong. Since 1018 (the 9th year of Goryeo&#x27;s King Hyeonjong), this area has been officially called &quot;Gyeonggi&quot;.
During the Joseon, which was founded after the Goryeo, King Taejo of Joseon set the capital in Hanyang, while restructuring Gyeonggi&#x27;s area to include Gwangju, Suwon, Yeoju, and Anseong, along with the southeast region. Since the period of King Taejong and Sejong the Great, the Gyeonggi region has been very similar to the current administrative area of Gyeonggi Province.

In 1895 the 23-Bu system, which reorganized administrative areas, was effected. The Gyeonggi region was divided into Hanseong (modern Seoul), Incheon, Chungju, Gongju, and Kaesong.

During the Japanese colonial period, Hanseong-bu was incorporated into Gyeonggi Province. On October 1, 1910, it was renamed Keijo and a provincial government was placed in Keijo according to the reorganization of administrative districts.

After liberation and the foundation of two separate Korean states, Gyeonggi Province and its capital, Seoul, were separated with partial regions of Gyeonggi Province being incorporated into Seoul thereafter in 1946. Additionally, Kaesong became North Korean territory, the only city to change control after the countries were divided at the 38th parallel, which is now part of North Korea&#x27;s North Hwanghae Province.

In 1967 the seat of the Gyeonggi provincial government was transferred from Seoul to Suwon. After Incheon separated from Gyeonggi Province in 1981, Gyeonggi regions such as Ongjin County and Ganghwa County were incorporated into Incheon in 1995.

Its dimension is 10% of Korea&#x27;s territory, . It is in contact with of cease-fire line to the north, of coastline to the west, Gangwon Province to the east, North Chungcheong Province and South Chungcheong Province to the south, and has Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea, in its center. Its provincial government is in Suwon, but some of its government buildings are in Uijeongbu for the administrative conveniences of the northern region.

===Climate===

Spring is warm, summer is hot and humid, autumn is cool, and winter is cold and snowy. The annual average temperature is between , where the temperature in the mountainous areas to the northeast is lower and the coastal areas to the southwest is higher. For January&#x27;s average temperature, the Gyeonggi Bay is , the Namhangang (River) Basin is , and the Bukhangang (River) and Imjingang Basins are . It becomes colder and higher in temperature differentiation from coastal to inland areas. Summer has a lower local differentiation compared to winter.

===Nature and national parks===
The topography of Gyeonggi Province is divided into southern and northern areas by the Han River, which flows from east to west. The area north to the Han River is mainly mountainous, while the southern area is mainly plain.

The configuration of Gyeonggi Province is represented by &quot;Dong-go-seo-jeo&quot; (high in the east and low in the west), where the Gwangju Mountain Range and the Charyeong Mountain Range spreads from the east and drops in elevation in the west. The fields of Gimpo, Gyeonggi, and Pyeongtaek extend to the west.

Gyeonggi Province natural environment includes its rivers, lakes, mountains, and seas. Its representative rivers are the Hangang, Imjingang, and Anseongcheon 
Fg(Stream), which flow into the Yellow Sea, with Gyeonggi Plain, Yeonbaek Plain and Anseong Plain forming a fertile field area around the rivers. The Gwangju Mountain Range and the Charyeong Mountain Range stretch toward China in Gyeonggi Province. Most of the mountains that rise above , such as Myeongjisan (), Gukmangbong () and Yongmunsan () in the Gwangju Mountain Range. It iriidc
Ktihas a developed granite area which, due to the granite&#x27;s exfoliation effect, makes it full of strangely shaped cliffs and deep valleys. The Charyeong Mountain Range forms the boundary between Gyeonggi Province and North Chungcheong Province, but is a relatively low-altitude hilly area.

In Gyeonggi Province, there is Bukhansan National Park in Uijeongbu. For provincial parks, there are the Chukryeongsan Natural Recreation Area, Namhan-sanseong Provincial Park, Gapyeong Yeoninsan Provincial Park, and Mulhyanggi Arboretum. Besides the listed, the scenery of well-known mountains including Soyosan of Dongducheon City, Yongmunsan of Yangpyeong County, and Gwanaksan of Anyang and Gwacheon, along with Hangang and Imjingang are tourist sites of Gyeonggi Province.

==Population==
Gyeonggi Province has shown a rapid increase in population due to the modernization and urbanization of the Republic of Korea. Its population has increased from 2,748,765 in 1960 to 3,703,761 in 1980; 6,050,943 in 1990; 8,984,134 in 2000; 11,379,459 in 2010; and 13,511,676 in 2020.

In 2010 there were 4,527,282 households, with an average of 3 people per family. There were 6,112,339 males and 5,959,545 females. The population density was 1,119 people/km2, almost double the national average of 486 people/km2.

The province&#x27;s most heavily populated area as of 2024 is Suwon (1,195,000) followed by Yongin (1,085,000), Goyang (1,071,000), Hwasung (962,000), Seongnam (915,000) and Bucheon (772,000). The lowest populated area in 2010 was Yeoncheon County (41,000), followed by Gapyeong County (62,000) and Yangpyeong County (72,595).

==Economy==
As the backbone of Seoul in the means of manufacturing complex, Gyeonggi Province is evenly developed in heavy industry (electronics, machine, heavy and chemical industry, steel), light industry (textile), and farm, livestock and fisheries industry. Due to the influence of recent high wages, the weight of manufacturing industries has decreased in Korea&#x27;s economy.

<text>The Aromanians () are an ethnic group native to the southern Balkans who speak Aromanian, an Eastern Romance language. They traditionally live in central and southern Albania, south-western Bulgaria, northern and central Greece, and North Macedonia, and can currently be found in central and southern Albania, south-western Bulgaria, south-western and eastern North Macedonia, northern and central Greece, southern Serbia, and south-eastern Romania (Northern Dobruja). An Aromanian diaspora living outside these places also exists. The Aromanians are known by several other names, such as &quot;Vlachs&quot; or &quot;Macedo-Romanians&quot; (sometimes used to also refer to the Megleno-Romanians).

The term &quot;Vlachs&quot; is used in Greece and in other countries to refer to the Aromanians, with this term having been more widespread in the past to refer to all Romance-speaking peoples of the Balkan Peninsula and Carpathian Mountains region (Southeast Europe).

Their vernacular, Aromanian, is an Eastern Romance language very similar to Romanian, which has many slightly varying dialects of its own. Aromanian is considered to have developed from Common Romanian, a common stage of all the Eastern Romance varieties that evolved from the Vulgar Latin spoken by Paleo-Balkan peoples after the Romanization of the Balkan area that fell under the Latin sphere of influence. The Aromanian language shares many common features with Albanian, Bulgarian and Greek; however, although it has many loanwords from Greek, Slavic, and Turkish, its lexicon remains majority Romance in origin.

==Names and classification==
===Ethnonyms===
The term &quot;Aromanian&quot; derives directly from the Latin &quot;Romanus&quot;, meaning Roman citizen. The initial &quot;a-&quot; is a regular epenthetic vowel, occurring when certain consonant clusters are formed, and it is not, as folk etymology sometimes has it, related to the negative or privative &quot;a-&quot; of Greek (also occurring in Latin words of Greek origin). The term was coined by Gustav Weigand in his 1894 work &quot;Die Aromunen&quot;. The first book to which many scholars have referred to as the most valuable to translate their ethnic name is a grammar printed in 1813 in Vienna by Mihail G. Boiagi. It was titled Γραμματική Ρωμαϊκή ήτοι Μακεδονοβλαχική/&quot;Romanische oder Macedonowlachische Sprachlehre&quot; (&quot;Romance or Macedono-Vlach Grammar&quot;).

The term &quot;Vlach&quot; is an exonym used since medieval times. Aromanians call themselves &quot;Rrãmãn&quot; or &quot;Armãn&quot;, depending on which of the two dialectal groups they belong, and identify as part of the &quot;Fara Armãneascã&quot; (&quot;Aromanian tribe&quot;) or the &quot;Populu Armãnescu&quot; (&quot;Aromanian people&quot;). The endonym is rendered in English as &quot;Aromanian&quot;, in Romanian as &quot;Aromâni&quot;, in Greek as &quot;Armanoi&quot; (Αρμάνοι), in Albanian as &quot;Arumunët&quot;, in Bulgarian as &quot;Arumani&quot; (Арумъни), in Macedonian as &quot;Aromanci&quot; (Ароманци), in Serbo-Croatian as &quot;Armani&quot; and &quot;Aromuni&quot;.

The term &quot;Vlach&quot; was used in medieval Balkans as an exonym for all the Romance-speaking (Romanized) people of the region, as well as a general name for shepherds, but nowadays is commonly used for the Aromanians and Meglenites, Daco-Romanians being named Vlachs only in Serbia, Bulgaria and North Macedonia. The term is noted in the following languages: Greek &quot;Vlachoi&quot; (), Albanian &quot;Vllehët&quot;, Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian &quot;Vlasi&quot; (Bласи), Turkish &quot;Ulahlar&quot;, Hungarian &quot;Oláh&quot;. It is noteworthy that the term Vlach also meant &quot;bandit&quot; or &quot;rebel&quot; in Ottoman historiography, and that the term was also used as an exonym for mainly Orthodox Christians in Ottoman-ruled western Balkans (mainly denoting Serbs), as well as by the Venetians for the immigrant Slavophone population of the Dalmatian hinterland (also mainly denoting Serbs).

===Groups===
German academic Thede Kahl, expert on Aromanian studies, divides the Aromanians into two main groups, the &quot;Rrãmãnji&quot; and &quot;Armãnji&quot;, which are further divided into sub-groups.

Rrãmãnji
* &quot; Muzãchiars&quot;, from Muzachia situated in southwestern-central Albania.
* &quot;Fãrshãrots&quot; (or &quot;Fãrsherots&quot;), mostly concentrated in Epirus, from the Frashër (Aromanian &quot;Farshar&quot;) area in south-eastern Albania.
* &quot;Moscopolitans&quot; or &quot;Moscopoleans&quot;, from the city of Moscopole, once an important urban center of the Balkans, now a village in southeastern Albania.

Armãnji
* &quot;Pindeans&quot;, concentrated in and around the Pindus Mountains of Northern and Central Greece.
* &quot;Gramustians&quot; (or &quot;Gramosteans&quot;, gr. &quot;grammostianoi&quot;), from Gramos Mountains, an isolated area in south-eastern Albania, and north-west of Greece.

===Nicknames===
The Aromanian communities have several nicknames depending on the country where they are living.

* Gramustians and Pindians are nicknamed &quot;Koutsovlachs&quot; (Greek: Κουτσόβλαχοι). This term is sometimes taken as derogatory, as the first element of this term is from the Greek &quot;koutso-&quot; (κουτσό-) meaning &quot;lame&quot;. Following a Turkish etymology where &quot;küçük&quot; means &quot;little&quot; they are the smaller group of Vlachs as opposed to the more numerous Vlachs (Daco-Romanians).
* Fãrsherots, from Frashër (Albania), Moscopole and Muzachia are nicknamed &quot;Frasariotes&quot; (Greek: Φρασαριώτες Βλάχοι) or &quot;Arvanitovlachs&quot; (Greek: Αρβανιτόβλαχοι), meaning &quot;Albanian Vlachs&quot; referring to their place of origin.

In the South Slavic countries, such as Serbia, North Macedonia and Bulgaria, the nicknames used to refer to the Aromanians are usually &quot;Vlasi&quot; (South Slavic for Vlachs and Wallachians) and &quot;Tsintsari&quot; (also spelled &quot;Tzintzari, Cincari&quot; or similar), which is derived from the way the Aromanians pronounce the word meaning five, &quot;tsintsi&quot;. In Romania, the demonym &quot;Macedoni&quot;, &quot;Machedoni&quot; or &quot;Macedoromâni&quot; is also used. In Albania, the terms &quot;Vllah&quot; or &quot;Vlleh&quot; (&quot;Vlach&quot;) and &quot;Çoban&quot; or &quot;Çobenj&quot; (from Turkish &quot;çoban&quot;, &quot;shepherd&quot;) are used.

==Population==

===Settlements===

The Aromanian community in Albania is estimated up to 200,000 people, including those who no longer speak the language. Tanner estimates that the community constitutes 2% of the population. In Albania, Aromanian communities inhabit Moscopole, their most famous settlement, the Kolonjë District (where they are concentrated), a quarter of Fier (Aromanian &quot;Ferãcã&quot;), while Aromanian was taught, as recorded by Tom Winnifrith, at primary schools in Andon Poçi near Gjirokastër, Shkallë (Aromanian &quot;Scarã&quot;) near Sarandë, and Borovë near Korçë (Aromanian &quot;Curceau&quot;) (1987).

A Romanian research team concluded in the 1960s that Albanian Aromanians migrated to Tirana, Stan Karbunarë, Skrapar, Pojan, Bilisht and Korçë, and that they inhabited Karaja, Lushnjë, Moscopole, Drenovë (Aromanian &quot;Dãrnova&quot;) and Boboshticë (Aromanian &quot;Bubushtitsa&quot;).
There was an important community of Aromanians in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina that was probably assimilated by local dwellers. Initially they were Christians but around year 1000 they adhered to Bogomil/Patarene Christian sect and were Serbianized. After the Turkish occupation, the Aromanians of Bosnia and Herzegovina converted to Islam faith due to economic and religious motives. There are many artifacts of Aromanians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly in their necropolises. These necropolises cover all Bosnia and consist of funerary monuments, generally without crosses.

==Origins==


===Language===
The Aromanian language is related to the Vulgar Latin spoken in the Balkans during the Roman period. It is hard to establish the history of the Vlachs in the Balkans, with a gap between the barbarian invasions and the first mentions of the Vlachs in the 11th and 12th centuries. Byzantine chronicles are unhelpful, and only in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries does the term &quot;Vlach&quot; become more frequent, although it proves problematic to distinguish sorts of Vlachs as it was used for various subjects, such as the empire of the Asen dynasty, Thessaly, and Romania across the Danube. It has been assumed that Vlachs are descendants of Roman soldiers or Latinized original populations (Greeks, Illyrians, Thracians or Dacians), due to the historical Roman military presence in the territory inhabited by the community. Many Romanian scholars maintain that the Aromanians were part of a Daco-Romanian migration from the north of the Danube between the 6th and 10th centuries, supporting the theory that the &#x27;Great Romanian&#x27; population descend from the ancient Dacians and Romans. Greek scholars view the Aromanians as descendants of Roman legionaries that married Greek women. There is no evidence for either theory, and Winnifrith deems them improbable. The little evidence that exists points that the Vlach (Aromanian) homeland was within the Latin sphere of influence in the Northern Balkans, north of the Jireček Line, which roughly demarcated the areas of influence of Latin and Greek. With the Slavic breakthrough of the Danube frontier in the 7th century, Latin-speakers were pushed further southwards. Based on linguistic considerations, Olga Tomic concludes that Aromanians moved from Thrace to their present locations after the Slavic invasion of Thrace, though before the Megleno-Romanians.

===Genetic studies===
In 2006 &quot;Bosch et al.&quot; attempted to determine if the Aromanians are descendants of Latinised Dacians, Greeks, Illyrians, Thracians or a combination of these, but it was shown that they are genetically indistinguishable from the other Balkan populations. Linguistic and cultural differences between Balkan groups were deemed too weak to prevent gene flow among the groups.

;Y-DNA haplogroups
Haplogroup R1b is the most common haplogroup among two or three of the five tested Aromanian populations, which is not shown as a leading mark of the Y-DNA locus in other regions or ethnic groups on the Balkan Peninsula. On the 16 Y-STR markers from the five Aromanian populations, Jim Cullen&#x27;s predictor speculates that over half of the mean frequency of 22% R1b of the Aromanian populations is more likely to belong to the L11 branch. L11 subclades form the majority of Haplogroup R1b in Italy and western Europe, while the eastern subclades of R1b are prevailing in populations of the eastern Balkans.

==History and self-identification==
The Aromanians or Vlachs first appear in medieval Byzantine sources in the 11th century, in the &quot;Strategikon of Kekaumenos&quot; and Anna Komnene&#x27;s &quot;Alexiad&quot;, in the area of Thessaly. In the 12th century, the Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela records the existence of the district of &quot;Vlachia&quot; near Halmyros in eastern Thessaly, while the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates places &quot;Great Vlachia&quot; near Meteora. Thessalian Vlachia was apparently also known as &quot;Vlachia in Hellas&quot;. Later medieval sources also speak of an &quot;Upper Vlachia&quot; in Epirus, and a &quot;Little Vlachia&quot; in Aetolia-Acarnania, but &quot;Great Vlachia&quot; is no longer mentioned after the late 13th century.

The medieval Vlachs (Aromanians) of Herzegovina are considered authors of the famous funerary monuments with petroglyphs ( in Serbian) from Herzegovina and surrounding countries. The theory of the Vlach origin was proposed by Bogumil Hrabak (1956) and Marian Wenzel and more recently was supported by the archeological and anthropological researches of skeleton remains from the graves under stećci. The theory is much older and was first proposed by Arthur Evans in his work &quot;Antiquarian Researches in Illyricum&quot; (1883). While doing research with Felix von Luschan on stećak graves around Konavle, he found that a large number of skulls were not of Slavic origin but similar to older Illyrian and Albanian tribes, as well as noting that Dubrovnik memorials recorded those parts inhabited by the Vlachs until the 15th century.

===Aromanians within the Balkan nationalisms of the 19th and 20th centuries===

A distinct Aromanian consciousness was not developed until the 19th century, and was influenced by the rise of other national movements in the Balkans.

Until then, the Aromanians, as Eastern Orthodox Christians, were subsumed with other ethnic groups into the wider ethnoreligious group of the &quot;Romans&quot; (in Greek &quot;Rhomaioi&quot;, after the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire), which in Ottoman times formed the distinct &quot;Rum millet&quot;. The &quot;Rum millet&quot; was headed by the Greek-dominated Patriarchate of Constantinople, and the Greek language was used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; among Balkan Orthodox Christians throughout the 17th–19th centuries. As a result, wealthy, urbanized Aromanians were culturally Hellenized and played a major role in the dissemination of Greek language and culture; indeed, the first book written in Aromanian was written in the Greek alphabet and aimed at spreading Greek among Aromanian-speakers.

By the early 19th century, however, the distinct Latin-derived nature of the Aromanian language began to be studied in a series of grammars and language booklets. In 1815, the Aromanians of Budapest requested permission to use their language in liturgy, but it was turned down by the local metropolitan.

The establishment of a distinct Aromanian national consciousness, however, was hampered by the tendency of the Aromanian upper classes to be absorbed in the dominant surrounding ethnicities, and espouse their respective national causes as their own. So much did they become identified with the host nations that Balkan national historiographies portray the Aromanians as the &quot;best Albanians&quot;, &quot;best Greeks&quot; and &quot;best Bulgarians&quot;, leading to researchers calling them the &quot;chameleons of the Balkans&quot;. Consequently, many Aromanians played a prominent role in the modern history of the Balkan nations: the revolutionary Pitu Guli, Greek Prime Minister Ioannis Kolettis, Greek magnate Georgios Averoff, Greek Defence Minister Evangelos Averoff, Serbian Prime Minister Vladan Đorđević, Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople, Romanian metropolitan Andrei Şaguna etc.

Following the establishment of independent Romania and the autocephaly of the Romanian Orthodox Church in the 1860s, the Aromanians increasingly began to come under the influence of the Romanian national movement. Although vehemently opposed by the Greek church, the Romanians established an extensive state-sponsored cultural and educative network in the southern Balkans: the first Romanian school was established in 1864 by the Aromanian Dimitri Atanasescu, and by the early 20th century there were 100 Romanian churches and 106 schools with 4,000 pupils and 300 teachers. As a result, Aromanians divided into two main factions, one pro-Greek, the other pro-Romanian, plus a smaller focusing exclusively on its Aromanian identity.

With the support of the Great Powers, and especially Austria-Hungary, the &quot;Aromanian-Romanian movement&quot; culminated in the recognition of the Aromanians as a distinct &quot;millet&quot; (the Ullah millet) by the Ottoman Empire on 22 May 1905, with corresponding freedoms of worship and education in their own language. Nevertheless, due to the advanced assimilation of the Aromanians, this came too late to lead to the creation of a distinct Aromanian national identity; indeed, as Gustav Weigand noted in 1897, most Aromanians were not only indifferent, but actively hostile to their own national movement.

At the same time, the Greek–Romanian antagonism over Aromanian loyalties intensified with the armed Macedonian Struggle, leading to the rupture of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1906. During the Macedonian Struggle, most Aromanians participated on the &quot;patriarchist&quot; (pro-Greek) side, but some sided with the &quot;exarchists&quot; (pro-Bulgarians). However, following the Balkan Wars of 1912–13, Romanian interest waned, and when it revived in the 1920s it was designed more towards encouraging the Romanians&#x27; &quot;Macedonian brothers&quot; to emigrate to Southern Dobruja, where there were strong non-Romanian minorities.

While Romanian activity declined, from World War I on and with its involvement in Albania, Italy made some efforts—not very successful—in converting pro-Romanian sympathies into pro-Italian ones. In World War II, during the Axis occupation of Greece, Italy encouraged Aromanian nationalists to form an &quot;Aromanian homeland&quot;, the so-called Principality of the Pindus. The project never gained much traction among the local population, however. On the contrary, many leading figures of the Greek Resistance against the Axis, like Andreas Tzimas, Stefanos Sarafis, and Alexandros Svolos, were Aromanians. The &quot;principality&quot; project collapsed with the Italian armistice in 1943.

===Modern Aromanian identities===
The date of the announcement of the Ottoman &quot;irade&quot; of 23 May 1905 has been adopted in recent times by Aromanians in Albania, Australia, Bulgaria and North Macedonia as the &quot;Aromanian National Day&quot; (), but notably not in Greece or among the Aromanians in the Greek diaspora. In Romania, every 10 May, the Balkan Romanianness Day is celebrated instead for the same event. This observance is meant for the Aromanians but also for the Megleno-Romanians and the Istro-Romanians.

In modern times, Aromanians generally have adopted the dominant national culture, often with a dual identity as both Aromanian and Greek/Albanian/Bulgarian/Macedonian/Serbian/etc. Aromanians are also found outside the borders of Greece. There are many Aromanians in southern Albania and in towns all over the Balkans, while Aromanians identifying as Romanians are still to be found in areas where Romanian schools were active. There are also many Aromanians who identify themselves as solely Aromanian (even, as in the case of the &quot;Cincars&quot;, when they no longer speak the language). Such groups are to be found in southwestern Albania, the eastern parts of North Macedonia, the Aromanians who immigrated to Romania in 1940, and in Greece in the Veria (Aromanian &quot;Veryia&quot;) and Grevena (Aromanian &quot;Grebini&quot;) areas and in Athens.

==Culture==
===Religion===
The Aromanians are predominantly Orthodox Christians, and follow the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar.

===Cuisine===

Aromanian cuisine is strongly influenced by Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine.

===Music===

Polyphonic music is common among the Aromanians, and follows a common set of rules.

===Literature===

A literature in the Aromanian language exists.

===Clothing===

In Aromanian rural areas, clothes differed from the dress of the city dwellers. The shape and the colour of a garment, the volume of the headgear, the shape of a jewel could indicate cultural affiliation and also could show the village people came from. Fustanella usage among Aromanians can be traced to at least the 15th century, with notable examples being seen in the Aromanian stećak of the Radimlja necropolis.
Additionally Aromanians claim the fustanella as their ethnic costume.

===Sports===
There are some famous Aromanian sport personalities like tennis player Simona Halep and football player Gheorghe Hagi. In Romania, they also have their own football team called Armãnamea, who have been representing them since 2008 in the European football tournament for minorities, Europeada. There also exists the Cupa Armânamea, a futsal competition organized by Aromanians in Romania.

==Aromanians today==

===In Greece===


In Greece, Aromanians are not recognised as an ethnic but as a linguistic minority and, like the Arvanites, have been indistinguishable in many respects from other Greeks since the 19th century. Although Greek Aromanians would differentiate themselves from native Greeks (&quot;Grets&quot;) when speaking in Aromanian, most still consider themselves part of the broader Greek nation (&quot;Elini&quot;, Hellenes), which also encompasses other linguistic minorities such as the Arvanites or the Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia. Greek Aromanians have long been associated with the Greek national state, actively participated in the Greek Struggle for Independence, and have obtained very important positions in government, although there was an attempt to create an autonomous Aromanian canton under the protection of Italy at the end of World War I, called Principality of the Pindus. Aromanians have been very influential in Greek politics, business and the army. Revolutionaries Rigas Feraios and Giorgakis Olympios, Prime Minister Ioannis Kolettis, billionaires and benefactors Evangelos Zappas and Konstantinos Zappas, businessman and philanthropist George Averoff, Field Marshal and later Prime Minister Alexandros Papagos, and conservative politician Evangelos Averoff were all either Aromanians or of partial Aromanian heritage. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of Aromanians in Greece today. The Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 estimated their number between 150,000 and 200,000, but the last two censuses to differentiate between Christian minority groups, in 1940 and 1951, showed 26,750 and 22,736 Vlachs respectively. Estimates on the number of Aromanians in Greece range between 40,000 and 300,000. Kahl estimates the total number of people with Aromanian origin who still understand the language as no more than 300,000, with the number of fluent speakers under 100,000.

The majority of the Aromanian population lives in northern and central Greece; Epirus, Macedonia and Thessaly. The main areas inhabited by these populations are the Pindus Mountains, around the mountains of Olympus and Vermion, and around the Prespa Lakes near the border with Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia. Some Aromanians can still be found in isolated rural settlements such as Samarina (Aromanian &quot; Samarina&quot;, &quot;Xamarina&quot; or &quot;San Marina&quot;), Perivoli (Aromanian &quot;Pirivoli&quot;) and Smixi (Aromanian &quot;Zmixi&quot;). There are also Aromanians (Vlachs) in towns and cities such as Ioannina (Aromanian &quot;Ianina&quot;, &quot;Enina&quot; or &quot;Enãna&quot;), Metsovo (Aromanian &quot;Aminciu&quot;), Veria
(Aromanian &quot;Veryia&quot;) Katerini, Trikala (Aromanian &quot;Trikolj&quot;), Grevena (Aromanian &quot; Grebini&quot;) and Thessaloniki (Aromanian &quot;Sãruna&quot;)

Generally, the use of the minority languages has been discouraged in Greece, although recently there have been efforts to preserve the endangered languages (including Aromanian) of Greece.

Since 1994, the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki offers beginner and advanced courses in &quot;Koutsovlach&quot;, and cultural festivals with over 40,000 participants—the largest Aromanian cultural gatherings in the world—regularly take place in Metsovo. Nevertheless, there are no exclusively Aromanian newspapers, and the Aromanian language is almost totally absent from television. Indeed, although as of 2002 there were over 200 Vlach cultural associations in Greece, many did not even feature the term &quot;Vlach&quot; in their titles, and only a few are active in preserving the Aromanian language.

In 1997, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe passed Recommendation 1333 (1997) encouraging the Balkan states to take steps to rectify the &quot;critical situation&quot; of Aromanian culture and language. This was after pressure from the Union for Aromanian Language and Culture in Germany. In response, the then President of Greece, Konstantinos Stefanopoulos, publicly urged Greek Aromanians to teach the language to their children.

In 2001, 31 Aromanian mayors and heads of villages signed a protest resolution against the U.S. State Department report on the human rights situation in Greece. They complained &quot;against the direct or indirect characterisation of the Vlach-speaking Greeks as an ethnic, linguistic or other minority, stating that the Vlach-speaking Greeks never requested to be recognised by the Greek state as a minority, stressing that historically and culturally they were and still are an integral part of Hellenism, they would be bilingual and Aromanian would be secondary&quot;.

Furthermore, the largest Aromanian group in Greece (and across the world), the Panhellenic Federation of Cultural Associations of Vlachs in Greece, has repeatedly rejected the classification of Aromanian as a minority language or the Vlachs as a distinct ethnic group separate from the Greeks, considering the Aromanians as an &quot;integral part of Hellenism&quot;. The Aromanian (Vlach) Cultural Society, which is associated with Sotiris Bletsas, is represented on the Member State Committee of the European Bureau for Lesser Spoken Languages in Greece.

===In Albania===

The exact presence of the Aromanian community in Albania is unknown. They are mostly concentrated in parts of southern and western Albania. 8,266 people declared themselves to be Aromanians in the 2011 census. On the quality of the specific data the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities stated that &quot;the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities.&quot;. According to Tom Winnifrith in 1995, that there were about 200,000 individuals who were of Aromanian descent in Albania, regardless of proficiency in Aromanian, or spoke Aromanian without necessarily considering themselves to have a separate identity. According to Frank Kressing and Karl Kaser in 2002, there were between 30,000 and 50,000 Aromanians in Albania. Tanner (2004) pointed out Albania as the only country where Aromanians make a relatively significant percentage of population, around 2%.

For the last years there seems to be a renewal of the former policies of supporting and sponsoring of Romanian schools for Aromanians of Albania. As a recent article in the Romanian media points out, the kindergarten, primary and secondary schools in the Albanian town of Divjakë where the local Albanian Aromanians pupils are taught classes both in Aromanian and Romanian were granted substantial help directly from the Romanian government. One of the only churches serving the Aromanian minority in Albania is the St. Sotir Church () of Korçë, which was given 2 billion lei help from the Romanian government. They also have a political party named Party of the Vlachs of Albania (PVSH), which is the only in the world along with two in North Macedonia, and two social organisations named &quot;Shoqata Arumunët/Vllehtë e Shqiperisë&quot; (The Society of the Aromanians/Vlachs of Albania) and &quot;Unioni Kombëtar Arumun Shqiptar&quot; (The Aromanian Albanian National Union). Many of the Albanian Aromanians (Arvanito Vlachs) have immigrated to Greece, since they are considered in Greece part of the Greek minority in Albania. There are attempts to establish education in their native language in the town of Divjakë.

Notable Aromanians whose family background hailed from today&#x27;s Albania include Bishop Andrei Şaguna, and Father Haralambie Balamaci, whereas notable Albanians with an Aromanian family background are actors Aleksandër (Sandër) Prosi, Margarita Xhepa, Albert Vërria, and Prokop Mima, as well as composer Nikolla Zoraqi and singers Eli Fara and Parashqevi Simaku.

On 13 October 2017, Aromanians received the official status of ethnic minority, through voting of a bill by Albanian Parliament.

===In North Macedonia===


According to official government figures (census 2002), there are 9,695 Aromanians or Vlachs, as they are officially called in North Macedonia. According to the census of 1953 there were 8,669 Vlachs, 6,392 in 1981 and 8,467 in 1994. Aromanians are recognized as an ethnic minority, and are hence represented in Parliament and enjoy ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious rights and the right to education in their language.

There are Aromanian cultural societies and associations such as the Union for Aromanian Culture from North Macedonia, The Aromanian League of North Macedonia, The International League of Aromanians and &quot;Comuna Armãneascã &quot;Frats Manachi&quot;&quot;, (The Aromanian Community Manaki Brothers) in Bitola (Aromanian &quot;Bituli&quot; or &quot;Bitule&quot;). There also are two political parties representing the Aromanian minority of the country. These are the Democratic Union of the Vlachs of Macedonia (DSVM; , ) and the Party of the Vlachs of Macedonia (PVM; , ). They are the only Aromanian parties in the world along with the PVSH in Albania.

Many forms of Aromanian-language media have been established since the 1990s. North Macedonia&#x27;s Government provides financial assistance to Aromanian-language newspapers and radio stations. Aromanian-language newspapers such as Phoenix () service the Aromanian community. The Aromanian television program Spark (; Macedonian &quot;Искра&quot; (Iskra)) broadcasts on the second channel of the Macedonian Radio-Television.

There are Aromanian classes provided in primary schools and the state funds some Aromanian published works (magazines and books) as well as works that cover Aromanian culture, language and history. The latter is mostly done by the first Aromanian Scientific Society, &quot;Constantin Belemace&quot; in Skopje (Aromanian &quot;Scopia&quot;), which has organized symposiums on Aromanian history and has published papers from them. According to the last census, there were 9,596 Aromanians (0.48% of the total population). There are concentrations in Kruševo (Aromanian &quot;Crushuva&quot;) 1,020 (20%), Štip (Aromanian &quot;Shtip&quot;) 2,074 (4.3%), Bitola 1,270 (1.3%), Struga 656 (1%), Sveti Nikole (Aromanian &quot;San Nicole&quot;) 238 (1.4%), Kisela Voda 647 (1.1%) and Skopje 2,557 (0.5%).

===In Romania===

Since the Middle Ages, due to the Turkish occupation and the destruction of their cities, such as Moscopole, Gramos, (which never recovered) and later on Kruševo, many Aromanians fled their native homelands in the Balkans to settle the Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, which had a similar language and a certain degree of autonomy from the Turks. These immigrant Aromanians were assimilated into the Romanian population.

In 1925, 47 years after Dobruja was incorporated into Romania, King Ferdinand gave the Aromanians land and privileges to settle in this region, which resulted in a significant migration of Aromanians into Romania. Today, 25% of the population of the region are descendants of Aromanian immigrants.

There are currently between 50,000 and 100,000 Aromanians in Romania, most of which are concentrated in Dobruja. According to some Aromanian cultural organizations in Romania, there are some 100,000 Aromanians in Romania, and they are often called &quot;macedoni&quot; (&quot;Macedonians&quot;). Some Aromanian associations even place the total number of people of Aromanian descent in Romania as high as 250,000.

Recently, there has been a growing movement in Romania, both by Aromanians and by Romanian lawmakers, to recognize the Aromanians either as a separate cultural group or as a separate ethnic group, and extend to them the rights of other minorities in Romania, such as mother-tongue education and representatives in parliament.

In Romania exists the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society.

===In Bulgaria===

Most of the Aromanians in the Sofia region are descendants of emigrants from the region of Macedonia and northern Greece who arrived between 1850 and 1914.

In Bulgaria, most Aromanians were concentrated in the region south-west of Sofia, in the region called Pirin, formerly part of the Ottoman Empire until 1913. Due to this reason, a large number of these Aromanians moved to Southern Dobruja, part of the Kingdom of Romania after the Treaty of Bucharest of 1913. After the reinclusion of Southern Dobruja in Bulgaria with the Treaty of Craiova of 1940, most were moved to Northern Dobruja in a population exchange. Another group moved to northern Greece. Nowadays, the largest group of Aromanians in Bulgaria is found in the southern mountainous area, around Peshtera. Most Aromanians in Bulgaria originate from the Gramos Mountains, with some from North Macedonia, the Pindus Mountains in Greece and Moscopole in Albania.

After the fall of communism in 1989, Aromanians and Romanians (known as &quot;Vlachs&quot; in Bulgaria) have started initiatives to organize themselves under one common association.

According to the 1926 official census, there were 69,080 Romanians, 5,324 Aromanians, 3,777 &quot;Cutzovlachs&quot;, and 1,551 &quot;Tsintsars&quot;.

===In Serbia===

In medieval times, the Aromanians populated Herzegovina, a region today in Bosnia and Herzegovina close to modern Serbia, and elevated famous necropolises with petroglyphs (Radimlja, Blidinje, etc.). The Aromanians, known as &quot;Cincari&quot; (Цинцари), migrated to Serbia in the 18th and early 19th centuries. They most often were bilingual in Greek, and were often called &quot;Greeks&quot; (&quot;Grci&quot;). They were influential in the forming of Serbian statehood, having contributed with rebel fighters, merchants and intellectuals. Many Greek Aromanians (Грко Цинцари) came to Serbia with Alija Gušanac as &quot;krdžalije&quot; (mercenaries) and later joined the Serbian Revolution (1804–1817). Some of the notable rebels include Konda Bimbaša and Papazogli. Among the notable people of Aromanian descent are playwright Jovan Sterija Popović (1806–1856), novelist Branislav Nušić (1864–1938), and politician Vladan Đorđević (1844–1930).

The majority of Serbian people of Aromanian descent do not speak Aromanian and espouse a Serb identity. They live in Niš, Belgrade and some smaller communities in Southern Serbia, such as Knjaževac. The Lunjina Serbian–Aromanian Association was founded in Belgrade in 1991. According to the 2022 census, there were 327 Serbian citizens that identified as ethnic &quot;Cincari&quot;. However, unofficial estimates number the Aromanian population of Serbia at 5,000–15,000.

===Diaspora===

Aside from the Balkan countries, there are also communities of Aromanian emigrants living in Canada, the United States, France and Germany. Although the largest diaspora community is in select major Canadian cities, Freiburg, Germany has one of the most important Aromanian organisations, the Union for Aromanian Language and Culture. In the United States, the Society Farsharotu is the oldest and most well-known association of Aromanians, founded in 1903 by Nicolae Cican, an Aromanian native of Albania. In France, the Aromanians are grouped in the Trâ Armânami Association of French Aromanians.

<doc id="323105" wikidata="Q675901" url="?curid=323105" title="Duran Duran (1981 album)">
<text>Duran Duran is the debut studio album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 15June 1981 through EMI. Produced by Colin Thurston, it was recorded in London and Oxfordshire between December 1980 and January 1981. The instrumental tracks were recorded quickly, but vocalist Simon Le Bon initially struggled to sing in the studio, leading to discussions about replacing him before EMI employee Dave Ambrose intervened.

Influenced by artists such as David Bowie, the Human League, Japan and Chic, &quot;Duran Duran&quot; features a mixture of synthesiser-led pop tunes and more atmospheric tracks, with elements of disco, punk and dance. Le Bon&#x27;s cryptic lyrics cover topics from youthful torment and confusion to the band&#x27;s goals and ambitions. The cover artwork for the album and singles were designed by Malcolm Garrett.

Three singles appeared for the album, each promoted with music videos, which helped the album reach number three in the UK and remain in the top 100 for 118 weeks. The sexually-provocative video for &quot;Girls on Film&quot; was controversial, and generated publicity for the new MTV channel in the United States. Its initial US release on Capitol subsidiary Harvest Records was unsuccessful; a reissue there during the height of the band&#x27;s fame in 1983 reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

&quot;Duran Duran&quot; initially received mixed reviews. Critics felt the band did not stand out from their contemporaries, although some praised the singles. Retrospective reviews have been more positive, with critics complimenting the band for creating a modern sound that spearheaded the New Romantic movement. It was remastered and re-released in a 2010 special edition, with bonus demo and live tracks.

==Background==

Childhood friends John Taylor and Nick Rhodes formed Duran Duran in Birmingham, England, in 1978 with John&#x27;s art-school friend Stephen Duffy. The trio were influenced by David Bowie, the Human League, Ultravox, Lou Reed and Kraftwerk. The band performed live throughout 1979, going through numerous lineup changes before securing the lineup of John Taylor, Rhodes, drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Andy Taylor by early 1980. Around this time, they were hired as the resident band of the Birmingham nightclub Rum Runner; the club&#x27;s owners Paul and Michael Berrow became their managers.

Drama student Simon Le Bon was hired as Duran Duran&#x27;s lead singer in May 1980. Le Bon struggled to sing at first and did not fit the band&#x27;s desire for a singer who, according to Rhodes, was a mix between Reed, Bowie and Iggy Pop. Having written poems and stories during his childhood, the band were impressed with Le Bon&#x27;s skill with melodies; he composed the lyrics and vocal line for &quot;Sound of Thunder&quot; during his first audition. Andy Taylor told a journalist, &quot;Simon came in with this book of poetry and kept coming up with these ideas and melodies. We were like, &#x27;This guy doesn&#x27;t even know what his potential is.&#x27; There was an innocence to it all&quot;. Duran Duran&#x27;s first performance with the lineup of Le Bon, Rhodes and the three Taylors was on 16July 1980 at the Rum Runner.

==Development==

Duran Duran spent two months writing songs and developing their sound. According to the biographer Steve Malins, John Taylor was an integral part of the group during this period: &quot;The sensitive, charming, ad-libbing pop star to Rhodes&#x27;s more controlled Pop Art alter ego&quot;. Rhodes worked creatively with Andy, playing around the keyboardist&#x27;s patterns and solidifying the melodies. Malins writes that Andy&#x27;s skill as an arranger assisted in forming the band&#x27;s &quot;rough, undisciplined mixture[s]&quot; of punk, disco and electronic styles into tight, cohesive structures; Roger Taylor&#x27;s &quot;compact, unshakable drumming&quot; provided a backbone for the group.

According to John Taylor, grooves, chord progressions and melodies were primarily derived from jam sessions. They further developed tracks they had debuted live, such as &quot;Night Boat&quot;, &quot;Late Bar&quot;, &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, &quot;Sound of Thunder&quot; and an early version of &quot;Tel Aviv&quot;. Andy Taylor later said, &quot;In the beginning that worked because as we wrote the songs we&#x27;d all be pitching in and experimenting&quot;. John Taylor recalls that &quot;Night Boat&quot;, in particular, arose from a &quot;drifting keyboard sample&quot; by Rhodes with Andy&#x27;s Roland guitar synthesiser. Le Bon was a quick writer, coming up with lyrics to &quot;Girls on Film&quot; after receiving the first version. During the writing period, Duran Duran agreed to credit all songs to the band and split all earnings evenly.

By September 1980, Duran Duran had written all of what would become their first studio album. They continued performing live and demoing tracks at Bob Lamb&#x27;s Birmingham studio and London&#x27;s 24-track AIR Studios while Paul Berrow worked on attracting record-label attention. Throughout the rest of the year, they opened for Pauline Murray and Hazel O&#x27;Connor, and secured an article with &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine, whose writer Betty Page aligned them with the rising New Romantic movement and drew comparisons with the London-based new wave band Spandau Ballet. With their live performances attracting attention, Duran Duran signed with EMI following a bidding war with Phonogram Records.

==Recording==
Duran Duran recorded their debut album over a six week period starting in December 1980. Colin Thurston was chosen as producer, having previously worked with Bowie, Pop, the Human League and Magazine; Thurston was happy to work with Duran Duran after hearing the demo of &quot;Girls on Film&quot;. John Taylor later said, &quot;Colin was absolutely the right producer for us. He knew how to take what was best about us and magnify it, and boy, did he take our sound to another level&quot;. Initial work at Abbey Road Studios was insufficient, so recording moved to West London&#x27;s Red Bus Studios, a favourite of Thurston&#x27;s. &quot;Planet Earth&quot; was chosen as the debut single with &quot;Late Bar&quot; as its B-side, so the single was tracked first and sent to pressing plants before the remaining tracks. Tracks recorded at Red Bus included &quot;Careless Memories&quot;, &quot;Night Boat&quot;, &quot;Anyone Out There&quot;, &quot;To the Shore&quot;, &quot;Faster than Light&quot;, &quot;Tel Aviv&quot; and &quot;Khanada&quot;.
Recording began swiftly, with all the rhythm tracks completed within two weeks. Thurston gave each member individual attention with, in John Taylor&#x27;s words, &quot;no preferential treatment&quot;. Andy Taylor later said he played a pivotal role in establishing the band&#x27;s early sound: &quot;Colin was the filter that allowed us to come together as a whole&quot;. Rhodes gained insight into music production from Thurston while observing him behind the mixing desk. The band briefly returned to Birmingham for a Christmas Eve show, after which Andy Taylor and Rhodes travelled back to London to mix &quot;Planet Earth&quot; with Thurston at Utopia Studio. In addition to the album version, the band recorded an extended version of &quot;Planet Earth&quot; for use in nightclubs. According to John Taylor, this &quot;night version&quot; featured a longer middle section and a four-on-the-floor bass drum-driven intro, with additional percussion by Roger Taylor, slap bass by John and a horn section.

The sessions continued in January 1981 at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in Oxfordshire to record the guitar parts, keyboard overdubs and vocals. Due to Le Bon&#x27;s inexperience with studio recording, the vocal tracks proved difficult; according to Andy Taylor, Thurston was &quot;very rough&quot; on the singer. Le Bon felt pressured, particularly when EMI executives arrived to check on progress. The Berrows were initially concerned that they would have to replace Le Bon before EMI&#x27;s new A&amp;R director, Dave Ambrose, intervened, telling the singer to take his time and remember &quot;it&#x27;s all about the songs&quot;. Le Bon also stopped drinking and smoking at the instruction of Paul Berrow. Recording completed after the band&#x27;s first national tour.

==Music and lyrics==

Displaying the band&#x27;s wide range of influences, including Bowie, Ultravox, Roxy Music, Japan, Giorgio Moroder and Chic, &quot;Duran Duran&quot; contains a mixture of synthesiser-led pop tunes and more atmospheric tracks. Andy Taylor later said, &quot;We wrote the first album to kind of make up what we were going to be, what this futuristic sound was&quot;. Writer Annie Zaleski describes this sound as &quot;space-age keyboards, post-punk guitars, disco-inspired bass lines and Le Bon&#x27;s vocal croon&quot;. Malins finds the album &quot;full of melodic, dance-floor synthesiser pop delivered with youthful flair and the odd arty twist&quot;, at times similar to the &quot;disco-rock&quot; of Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Call Me&quot; and Japan&#x27;s &quot;Quiet Life&quot; (1979). &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine noted its dance rhythms against a pervading &quot;rock disco mix&quot;. Punk elements are also present on &quot;Careless Memories&quot;.

Zaleski highlights the cohesive-yet-contrasting musical styles of Andy Taylor&#x27;s guitars and Rhodes&#x27;s synthesisers. Playing in a number of cover bands before joining Duran Duran, Andy&#x27;s primary influences were rock bands which included AC/DC and Van Halen. He later said, &quot;[Nick] would do Eno and I would do Jeff Beck or Jimmy Page&quot;. John Taylor believes that Andy Taylor&#x27;s influences were responsible for developing their sound and enabling them to break out in America. Malins notes that the album has no guitar solos; Andy contributes &quot;melodic and punchy&quot; work, particularly on &quot;Girls on Film&quot; and &quot;Friends of Mine&quot;. The band incorporated additional sounds into some tracks, such as the sound of Paul&#x27;s Nikon camera opening &quot;Girls on Film&quot;; foghorns, humming motors and buoy bells on &quot;Night Boat&quot;, and a string section conducted by Richard Myhill at AIR Studios on the instrumental &quot;Tel Aviv&quot;.

Le Bon&#x27;s cryptic lyrics cover a variety of subjects, from youthful torment and confusion to the band&#x27;s goals and ambitions. The sexually exploitative &quot;Girls on Film&quot; is a critique of modeling culture, and &quot;Sound of Thunder&quot; tells the story of a man who begins World War III. The social commentary of &quot;Friends of Mine&quot; includes a line celebrating the release of George Davis, an armed robber who was the subject of a cause célèbre. Lost love and angst are explored on &quot;Anyone Out There&quot; and &quot;Night Boat&quot;, respectively. &quot;To the Shore&quot; is a power ballad filled with, according to Davis, lyrical neologisms such as &quot;gorging your sanhedralites&quot;. Le Bon shouts at one point during &quot;Careless Memories&quot;. In his book &quot;Please Please Tell Me Now&quot;, Davis writes: &quot;The fear of whispers and unwanted thoughts gives depth to the anxious lyrics, and Le Bon sounds harsh and bitter notes that wouldn&#x27;t be heard from this band again for a long time&quot;.

&quot;Planet Earth&quot; briefly acknowledges the band&#x27;s association with New Romantics, which Rhodes later called a form of irony; the band disliked their association with the movement. According to music journalist Stephen Davis, some fans believed that the song (with lines such as &quot;there&#x27;s no sign of life&quot;) was about the arrival of aliens; Le Bon later said that it may have been about the moment a child is born. In his memoir, John Taylor called &quot;Planet Earth&quot; &quot;a celebration of youth, of the possibility of youth, about feeling good to be alive&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Planet Earth&quot;, backed with &quot;Late Bar&quot;, was released as the group&#x27;s debut single on 2February 1981. Its artwork was designed by Malcolm Garrett, who would design the band&#x27;s album covers, singles and memorabilia for the next five years. The single&#x27;s number 12 placement on the UK Singles Chart earned Duran Duran an appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. According to Malins, their &quot;dandified [and] overdressed&quot; appearance secured their spot in the New Romantic movement in the minds of adolescents. The band promoted &quot;Planet Earth&quot; with a music video directed by Russell Mulcahy. Showcasing the band&#x27;s unique fashion choices, the video helped &quot;Planet Earth&quot; top the charts in Australia and Portugal. John Taylor was initially hesitant about the music video format, believing it was &quot;certainly at odds with the whole punk ethic&quot;. The band&#x27;s American label Capitol Records released &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, backed with &quot;To the Shore&quot;, in the US on its Harvest subsidiary, which failed to chart due to a lack of promotion.

Duran Duran launched a media campaign of interviews and photo shoots with &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, &quot;Mates&quot; and &quot;Patches&quot; magazines, while articles on the band appeared in &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;i-D&quot; and &quot;New Sounds, New Styles&quot;. EMI released the band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Careless Memories&quot; backed with &quot;Khanada&quot;, on 7&quot; vinyl on 20April 1981; a 12&quot; vinyl edition included a cover of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Fame&quot;. The single stalled at number 37 after three weeks. Ambrose later called it a mistake: &quot;I think in a way it was the marketing people&#x27;s fear that the band was getting too commercial too fast. [...] &#x27;Careless Memories&#x27; didn&#x27;t get any airplay, which was a bit scary. It didn&#x27;t lock in.&quot; To promote the single, the band appeared on the cover of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; for the first time. Rhodes later called its music video, directed by Perry Haines and Terry Jones, &quot;the worst video we&#x27;ve ever made&quot;; Malins described it as &quot;a folly of New Romantic pretension&quot;.

EMI released &quot;Duran Duran&quot; on 15June 1981. According to John, the band disliked the chosen cover photograph by Fin Costello but approved of Garrett&#x27;s design. The band began a short 11-date Faster than Light tour on 29June. To their surprise, they were greeted by screaming fans. Although the shows did not sell out, Le Bon said that their headbands inspired a short-lived &quot;national fashion&quot;. On 13July, &quot;Girls on Film&quot; was released as the third single, backed with &quot;Faster than Light&quot;. Reaching the UK top five and receiving substantial airplay on Radio 1, the single made Duran Duran one of the biggest new bands of 1981. According to Andy, the band knew that &quot;Girls on Film&quot; would be a bigger hit than &quot;Planet Earth&quot; but wanted to wait until they were established to release it.
The single helped &quot;Duran Duran&quot; peak at number three in the UK and spend 118 weeks on the chart, going platinum by December 1982 and selling 1.6 million copies worldwide. Elsewhere, the album topped the chart in Portugal, reached number two in New Zealand, number three in Sweden and number nine in Australia. The album was released later in the US, since Capitol wanted to see how it performed in Europe and Australia. Appearing in late June on the Harvest label, the LP replaced &quot;To the Shore&quot; with the &quot;night version&quot; of &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and was unsuccessful. EMI issued a four-track, 12&quot; EP entitled &quot;Nite Romantics&quot; in Japan, featuring the &quot;night versions&quot; of &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;Girls on Film&quot;.

The music video for &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, directed by Godley &amp; Creme and filmed in August 1981, featured several semi-nude women performing sexually-suggestive acts in what author Roy Shuker described as &quot;soft porn&quot;. According to Paul, the video was deliberately made for the American audience, who believed that Duran Duran were a &quot;gay band&quot;. Ambrose said, &quot;It was very provocative, the first semi-pornographic long-form video which really shook everyone up in the clubs. And that&#x27;s what started to break [the band] in America&quot;. The American channel MTV, which premiered two weeks before the video was filmed, repeatedly screened the video. Co-founder John Sykes found it an effective way to generate publicity for the fledgling channel: &quot;[It] was something that could never be played on broadcast networks, but we could play it on MTV. So it brought a lot of people over to cable and MTV, to not only discover the cool new bands but also this art form that was not yet ready for prime-time television&quot;. It was banned by the BBC in England; a heavily-edited &quot;day version&quot; was made for airing on MTV, and the band capitalised on the controversy.

==Reception==

&quot;Duran Duran&quot; initially received mixed reviews. &quot;NME&quot; Chris Bohn and &quot;Trouser Press&quot;&#x27;s Ira Robbins felt the band lacked the skills needed to separate themselves from other New Romantic artists. Bohn was unimpressed with what he considered &quot;a sensibly-packaged, respectively safe and self-consciously worthy record that belies the promised glamour of their two earlier singles&quot;. He concluded that Duran Duran &quot;collapse through their weighty lifelessness&quot; partly attributed to Thurston&#x27;s &quot;lacklustre&quot; production that &quot;reduces stridently colourful highlights to fit the densely homogeneous whole&quot;. &quot;Smash Hits&quot;″ Beverly Hillier was also unimpressed, finding &quot;Simon Le Bon&#x27;s dull and lifeless vocals, together with lots of synth noises and rock guitar combine to make this album sound like one long drawn out single.&quot; In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Steve Sutherland believed the album worked better as background music and is &quot;actively better &quot;not&quot; to listen to&quot;. He called the band &quot;painlessly pointless, bouncy, bright and brilliant&quot;. More positively, &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s Betty Page called &quot;Duran Duran&quot; an &quot;incredible, mature debut bristling with prospective hit singles&quot;.

&quot;Billboard&quot; felt Duran Duran paired well with other acts of the New Romantic genre such as Spandau Ballet. Ira Robbins said the album &quot;contains more creative and diverse noises and thoughts than all the real and would-be Spandau Ballets put together&quot; in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;. The band were viewed in a mixed light by their musical peers. Gary Numan voiced his support, but Ultravox&#x27;s Midge Ure was an outspoken critic. Human League and Heaven 17 founder Martyn Ware saw Duran Duran as a &quot;glamour puss band&quot; who had &quot;no sense of originality or art about them&quot;.

Retrospective reviews of &quot;Duran Duran&quot; have been more positive. Twenty years after its release, Courtney Taylor-Taylor of the Dandy Warhols said: &quot;If you go back to the first record, they smoked everybody. It&#x27;s incredible! Disco bass-lines, Japan textures and mixed by the guy who did the Iggy Pop records&quot;. For AllMusic, Eduardo Rivadavia argued the album &quot;artfully coalesced the sonic and stylistic elements of the burgeoning new romantic movement they were soon to spearhead&quot;. He called the band&#x27;s choice of singles &quot;ultra-smart&quot; and, combined with their &quot;groundbreaking&quot; music videos, &quot;Duran Duran&quot; secured them as frontrunners of the MTV generation&quot;cementing their status as one of the decade&#x27;s most successful pop music icons&quot;. Zaleski described the album as modern &quot;art-school unorthodoxy meets pop futurism&quot;, and the work of a &quot;glamorous and modern young band&quot;. In a 2021 article discussing the band&#x27;s then-recent &quot;Future Past&quot; record, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called their debut album a &quot;classic&quot; that introduced &quot;a radical new style of art-glam punk-disco swagger&quot;.

==Reissues==
===US 1983 Capitol reissue===
During the height of the band&#x27;s fame after the release of their second album &quot;Rio&quot;, Capitol reissued &quot;Duran Duran&quot; in the US in late April 1983 and added the band&#x27;s then-current single &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; to the track listing. This release made the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart in August 1983, a few weeks after &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; hit number four, and reached number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Albums chart. By the time Duran Duran released their third album &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; in late 1983, &quot;Duran Duran&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; were still high on the charts.

The reissued &quot;Duran Duran&quot; LP featured updated cover art designed by Garrett, using the newer &quot;double D&quot; band logo featured on the &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; single and &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; cover. The new image positioned each band member equally close to the camera and depicted their varied looks, from tanned adventurers to rouged androgynes. This reflected the band&#x27;s teen-focused marketing, which promoted the image and personality of its individual members: &quot;everyone is someone&#x27;s favourite&quot;.

===Special edition===
&quot;Duran Duran&quot; was reissued in a special edition on 29March 2010, with remastered audio engineered by Andrew Walter at Abbey Road Studios. It contained the original album and a number of bonus tracks, including the band&#x27;s AIR and Manchester Square studio demos recorded on 29July and 8December 1980, respectively. The special edition also included a BBC radio session, recorded on 19June 1981, and a DVD with BBC footage and the band&#x27;s music videos from the era. Fans criticised the remaster as containing audio &quot;level-bouncing&quot;, loss of dynamic range and other defects, particularly on &quot;Girls on Film&quot;. Andy Taylor, who had left the band by that point, criticised the remaster, saying that it &quot;sounds like it was done down the pub&quot; and condemned EMI for promoting the demos as bonus tracks: &quot;They should be gifting them to fans after 30 years of support...shame on all involved&quot;. EMI acknowledged the defect at the beginning of &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, calling it a result of master-tape deterioration, but refused to recall the reissue.

Notes
*On the original US release, &quot;Girls on Film&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; switch places (and the &quot;night version&quot; of the latter is used instead). &quot;To the Shore&quot; was not on the original US release, and the 1983 US reissue added the previously unreleased &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; at the end of side one. The original 1983 US CD used the reissue version, however the 1993 UK Parlophone CD adds &quot;To the Shore&quot; to the end of the disc.

<doc id="323111" wikidata="Q41278" url="?curid=323111" title="Ulsan">
<text>Ulsan (; ), officially the Ulsan Metropolitan City, is South Korea&#x27;s seventh-largest metropolitan city and the eighth-largest city overall, with a population of over 1.1 million inhabitants. It is located in the south-east of the country, neighboring Busan to the south and facing Gyeongju to the north.

Ulsan is the industrial powerhouse of South Korea, forming the heart of the Ulsan Industrial District. It has the world&#x27;s largest automobile assembly plant, operated by the Hyundai Motor Company; the world&#x27;s largest shipyard, operated by Hyundai Heavy Industries; and the world&#x27;s third largest oil refinery, owned by SK Energy. In 2020, Ulsan had a GDP per capita of $65,352, the highest of any region in South Korea.

Ulsan is the city that built the first automobile hydrogen charging station in the country in 2009. In addition, the first hydrogen ship charging station in the country was installed in Jangsaengpo Port in 2021. Currently, the Ulsan Green Hydrogen Town project, a hydrogen city that supplies hydrogen by connecting the city and a hydrogen power plant, is in progress. In December 2016, 10 Hyundai ix35 FCEVs, the first hydrogen fuel cell taxis in the country, entered test operation.

==Administrative divisions==
Ulsan is divided into four &quot;gu&quot; (districts) and one &quot;gun&quot; (county):
*Buk District ()
*Dong District ()
*Jung District ()
*Nam District ()
*Ulju County ()

==History==
Stone tools found at the Mugeo-dong Ok-hyeon archaeological site indicate that Ulsan was inhabited by humans at least as early as the Paleolithic era. Other findings indicate human inhabitation in the Neolithic Era. Ulsan also contains a substantial number of settlement remains from the Bronze Age. During the Jinhan confederacy, Ulsan was a site of iron mining and production. In the Later Silla period, Ulsan served as an important port for the economic hub of Gyeongju, and likely saw the import of luxury Persian goods such as silver, glass, and peacock tails.

In 1592, the future port-town of Ulsan was the site of a major battle when warrior monks joined citizen soldiers in resisting Japanese invasion. On January 29, 1598, a combined military operation between Korea and China tried to besiege the castle, but failed as reinforcements from Japan came to delay the fighting. Records from the Joseon period show that Ulsan was developed as a shipbuilding site as early as 1642.

Owing to the two World Wars, Ulsan began to grow as an industrial center. During this time it was part of Keishōnan-dō. In 1962, Ulsan was chosen to become a Special Industrial Zone and in the following year, it formally became a city. The Hyundai Group and SK Group began setting up large businesses in Ulsan.
Hyundai Heavy Industries established the shipyard in Ulsan and Hyundai Motor Company started there. Later on SK Energy developed an oil refinery and petrochemical hub there. Ulsan soon transformed into a modern metropolitan city.

On December 31, 1996, legislation on the promotion of Ulsan to a metropolitan city was declared. Ulsan was promoted to a metropolitan city in July 15, 1997.

== Geography, geology, ecology ==
Geographically, Ulsan is located at the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula and the southern end of the Taebaek Mountains. The coastline, classified as a mountainous emergent coastline, exhibits relatively simple development and is adjacent to the East Sea.

Ulsan is bounded on Busan. Busan is to the south.

===Climate===

Ulsan has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;, bordering on &quot;Cwa&quot;), with cold but dry winters, and hot, humid summers. Monthly means range from in January to in August, with diurnal temperature ranges generally low. Its location on the Korean peninsula results in a seasonal lag. The warmest days occur in August and averaging very near . Precipitation is relatively low in the winter months, but there is high rainfall from April to September.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2015 census, a majority of Ulsan residents did not belong to any religion. Buddhism was the most common religion with 29.8% of residents being adherents, followed by Protestantism at 10.9% and Roman Catholicism at 4.2%.

==Economy==

As the centre of the &quot;Ulsan Industrial District&quot;, the city is the corporate base of the multinational Hyundai conglomerate. Up to 1962, Ulsan operated as a fishing port and market centre. As part of South Korea&#x27;s first five-year economic plan, Ulsan became an open port. Additionally, the government designated Ulsan as a Special Industrial District, which encouraged development of major industrial plants and factories: an oil refinery, fertilizer plants, automobile production, and heavy industries were developed here. The shipbuilding port Bangeojin was annexed by the city in 1962.

Hyundai Group founded Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan in 1973, which effectively turned the city into a company town and drew a large influx of workers into the city. The company&#x27;s importance to the city can be seen in its name&#x27;s omnipresence, with a highway named after Hyundai&#x27;s founder, and the hospital, school, theater, as well as many restaurants and department stores bearing the Hyundai name.

Amid a global downturn in shipbuilding, Hyundai Heavy Industries sold $1 billion of assets and laid off large numbers of employees in 2016. The company borrowed money from the state-run Korea Development Bank in order to purchase Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering, forming Korea Shipbuilding &amp; Offshore Engineering, with plans to move corporate headquarters to Seoul. Some view this downturn as an indicator of South Korea&#x27;s over-reliance on chaebols, and fear that a period of deindustrialization for Ulsan mirroring the United States&#x27; Rust Belt could be on the horizon.

The city has the world&#x27;s third largest oil refinery with 840,000 BPD, owned by SK Energy. South Korea&#x27;s no.3 S-oil refinery complex with 669,000BPD and 1.7million PX plant of world single largest facility, 39,000BPD lubricant base oil, owned by Saudi Aramco, is also in Ulsan.

Ulsan is the home of the world&#x27;s largest automobile assembly plant, with an annual capacity of 1,700,000 units, operated by Hyundai Motors. The plant started with 50,000 capacity in 1968 and has expanded 30 times to become the top complex in the world with its own export piers with logistics competitiveness. Its integrated design of related functions was inspired by the Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan.

In November 2011, SB LiMotive opened an advanced lithium-ion battery production plant in Ulsan. SB LiMotive was a 50-50 consortium of Samsung SDI and Robert Bosch GmbH. In September 2012, Samsung SDI bought out Robert Bosch GmbH&#x27;s portion of SB LiMotive for $95 million to gain 100% ownership of the Ulsan production facility. The Ulsan plant is one of Samsung SDI&#x27;s trio of advanced car-battery production facilities.
=== Hydrogen Town ===

The Ulsan Green Hydrogen Town is a hydrogen city being developed as a pilot project. As of October 2024, 188km of underground pipelines have been laid to connect hydrogen produced as a byproduct from petrochemical complexes to the city center.

==Transportation==

The city transport department plans to build a light-rail line. The bus system shows a specific ETA at most bus stops.

Ulsan Airport, constructed in 1970 and expanded in 1997, has more than 20 flights per day to and from Seoul&#x27;s Gimpo International Airport and 4 flights per week to and from Jeju International Airport. In November 2010, Korea&#x27;s high-speed train network, the KTX, was extended to Ulsan. This provides a high-speed link to Seoul, with a running time of just over 2 hours. The new KTX station, Ulsan Station, is in nearby Eonyang, with a series of express buses (5001-5005), as well as some city buses serving the new station. The original city station has been renamed Taehwa River Station.

In December 2016, 10 Hyundai ix35 FCEVs, the first hydrogen fuel cell taxis in the country, entered test operation.

==Sports==

The city hosts the K League 1 football club Ulsan HD FC. After the 2002 FIFA World Cup, they relocated from their former stadium in Jung District, which is now a municipal ground, to the Munsu Stadium, which hosted several matches during the 2002 World Cup. The club have been crowned champions of Asia twice, winning the AFC Champions League in 2012 and 2020. Ulsan was home to another football team, Ulsan Hyundai Mipo Dolphin FC, which played in the Korea National League until 2016, when it was dissolved. Currently, Ulsan is home to another football team, Ulsan Citizen FC, which plays in the K3 League.

It is also home to the University of Ulsan and its sports programs. Ulsan also hosts Korean Basketball League team Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus. Their home ground is Dongchun Gymnasium, which located in Jung-Gu.

Lotte Giants, a KBO League baseball club in Busan, plays some of their home matches at the Ulsan Munsu Baseball Stadium.

<text>Tobias Michael Carel Asser (; 28 April 1838 – 29 July 1913) was a Dutch lawyer and legal scholar.
In 1911, he won the Nobel Peace Prize (together with Alfred Fried) for his role in the establishment of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899 and for his achievements in establishing the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH).

==Life==
Tobias Michael Carel Asser was born on 28 April 1838 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in a Jewish family. He was the son of Carel Daniel Asser (1813–1885) and grandson of Carel Asser (1780–1836). He studied law at the University of Amsterdam and Leiden University and was a law professor at the University of Amsterdam.

Asser co-founded the &quot;Revue de Droit International et de Législation Comparée&quot; with John Westlake and Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns. He also co-founded the Institut de Droit International in 1873. In 1880 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

=== The Hague Conference on Private International Law ===
Asser was a leading legal mind in the area of private international law and firmly believed that sound legal frameworks that govern private cross-border relationships would promote peace and stability. In 1893, Asser initiated the convocation of the First Diplomatic Session of the HCCH, the preeminent global organisation in the area of private international law. The participating States were Austria-Hungary, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, and Switzerland. Asser was elected the Session&#x27;s President, and subsequently re-elected at the Second to Fourth Session which took place in 1894, 1900 and 1904 respectively. Under his leadership, the HCCH developed some multilateral treaties, the Hague Conventions, that unified the rules of private international law in the areas of Marriage (1902), Divorce (1902), Guardianship (1902), Civil Procedure (1905), Effects of Marriage (1905), and Deprivation of Civil Rights (1905).

In 1911, Asser received the Nobel Peace Prize. In his Award Ceremony Speech on 10 December 1911, Chairman of the Nobel Committee Jørgen Gunnarsson Løvland emphasised specifically Asser&#x27;s work in the field of private international law, and his achievements in establishing the HCCH, as reasons for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, describing Asser as &quot;a successor to or reviver of The Netherlands&#x27; pioneer work in international law in the seventeenth century&quot;, the Hugo Grotius of his time.

=== The Hague Peace Conferences ===
He was a delegate of the Netherlands to both Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907, where he urged the principle of compulsory arbitration be introduced in the economic area and contributed to the creation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration as the first global mechanism for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

=== The Permanent Court of Arbitration ===
In 1902, he sat on the first arbitration panel to hear an international controversy brought by two states under the auspice of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which was established as a result of the Hague Peace Conference of 1899 (the Pious Fund of the Californias Case). He also took a hand in the establishment of what would become The Hague Academy of International Law, though he did not live to see its foundation in 1923.

Asser died on 29 July 1913 in The Hague.

==Namesake==
A research institute in the fields of Private and Public International Law, European Law and International Commercial Arbitration is named after Tobias Michael Carel Asser. This is the T.M.C. Asser Instituut, based in The Hague, Netherlands.

<doc id="323114" wikidata="Q132037" url="?curid=323114" title="Acesulfame potassium">
<text>Acesulfame potassium (, or ), also known as acesulfame K or Ace K, is a synthetic calorie-free sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) often marketed under the trade names Sunett and Sweet One. In the European Union, it is known under the E number (additive code) E950. It was discovered accidentally in 1967 by German chemist Karl Clauss at Hoechst AG (now Nutrinova). Acesulfame potassium is the potassium salt of 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3&quot;H&quot;)-one 2,2-dioxide. It is a white crystalline powder with molecular formula and a molecular weight of 201.24 g/mol.

==Properties==
Acesulfame K is 200 times sweeter than sucrose (common sugar), as sweet as aspartame, about two-thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one-third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame&#x27;s aftertaste. Acesulfame K is often blended with other sweeteners (usually sucralose or aspartame). These blends are reputed to give a more sucrose-like taste whereby each sweetener masks the other&#x27;s aftertaste, or exhibits a synergistic effect by which the blend is sweeter than its components. Acesulfame potassium has a smaller particle size than sucrose, allowing for its mixtures with other sweeteners to be more uniform.

Unlike aspartame, acesulfame K is stable under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, allowing it to be used as a food additive in baking, or in products that require a long shelf life. Although acesulfame potassium has a stable shelf life, it can eventually degrade to acetoacetamide, which is toxic in high doses. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable. The acceptable daily intake of acesulfame potassium is listed as 15 mg/kg/day.

Acesulfame potassium is widely used in the human diet and excreted by the kidneys. It thus has been used by researchers as a marker to estimate to what degree swimming pools are contaminated by urine.

Other names for acesulfame K are potassium acesulfamate, potassium salt of 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxothiazin-4(3&quot;H&quot;)-one-2,3-dioxide, and potassium 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3&quot;H&quot;)-one-3-ate-2,2-dioxide.

== Effect on body weight ==
Acesulfame potassium provides a sweet taste with no caloric value. There is no high-quality evidence that using acesulfame potassium as a sweetener affects body weight or body mass index (BMI).

==Discovery==
Acesulfame potassium was developed after the accidental discovery of a similar compound (5,6-dimethyl-1,2,3-oxathiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide) in 1967 by Karl Clauss and Harald Jensen at Hoechst AG. After accidentally dipping his fingers into the chemicals with which he was working, Clauss licked them to pick up a piece of paper. Clauss is the inventor listed on a United States patent issued in 1975 to the assignee Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft for one process of manufacturing acesulfame potassium. Subsequent research showed a number of compounds with the same basic ring structure had different levels of sweetness. 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3&quot;H&quot;)-one 2,2-dioxide had particularly favourable taste characteristics and was relatively easy to synthesize, so it was singled out for further research, and received its generic name (acesulfame-K) from the World Health Organization in 1978. Acesulfame potassium first received approval for table top use in the United States in 1988.

==Safety==
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its general use as a safe food additive in 1988, and maintains that safety assessment, as of 2023. In a 2000 scientific review, the European Food Safety Authority determined that acesulfame K is safe in typical consumption amounts, and does not increase the risk of diseases.

<text>Alfred Hermann Fried (; 11 November 1864 – 4 May 1921) was an Austrian Jewish pacifist, publicist, journalist, co-founder of the German peace movement, and winner (with Tobias Asser) of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1911. Fried was also a supporter of Esperanto. He is the author of an Esperanto textbook and an Esperanto-German and German-Esperanto dictionary, first published in 1903 and republished in 1905.

== Life ==

Born in Vienna, Austrian Empire, Fried left school at the age of 15 and started to work in a bookshop. In 1883, he moved to Berlin, where he opened a bookshop of his own in 1887. Following the publication by Bertha von Suttner of &quot;Die Waffen nieder!&quot; (&quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot;) in 1889, he and von Suttner began in 1892 to print a magazine of the same name. In articles published within &quot;Die Waffen nieder!&quot; and its successor, &quot;Die Friedenswarte&quot; (&quot;The Peace Watch&quot;), he articulated his pacifist philosophy.

In 1892 he was a co-founder of the German Peace Society (Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft). He was one of the fathers of the idea of a modern organisation to assure worldwide peace (the principal idea was developed in the League of Nations and after the Second World War in the UN).

Fried was a prominent member of the Esperanto movement. In 1903 he published the book &quot;Lehrbuch der internationalen Hilfssprache Esperanto&quot; (&quot;Textbook of the International Language Esperanto&quot;).

In 1909 he collaborated with Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine of the Central Office of International Associations in the preparation of the &quot;Annuaire de la Vie Internationale&quot;.

In 1911 he received the Nobel Peace Prize together with Tobias Asser.

During World War I, Fried moved to neutral Switzerland, and continued to advocate international peace. He died in his hometown, Vienna, in 1921. His ashes are buried at Feuerhalle Simmering.

<doc id="323117" wikidata="Q510193" url="?curid=323117" title="Julia gens">
<text>The gens Julia was one of the most prominent patrician families in ancient Rome. Members of the gens attained the highest dignities of the state in the earliest times of the Republic. The first of the family to obtain the consulship was Gaius Julius Iulus in 489 BC. The gens is perhaps best known, however, for Gaius Julius Caesar, the dictator and grand uncle of the emperor Augustus, through whom the name was passed to the so-called Julio-Claudian dynasty of the first century AD. The Julius became very common in imperial times, as the descendants of persons enrolled as citizens under the early emperors began to make their mark in history.

==Origin==

The Julii were of Alban origin, mentioned as one of the leading Alban houses, which Tullus Hostilius removed to Rome upon the destruction of Alba Longa. The Julii also existed at an early period at Bovillae, evidenced by a very ancient inscription on an altar in the theatre of that town, which speaks of their offering sacrifices according to the &quot;lege Albana&quot;, or Alban rites. Their connection with Bovillae is also implied by the , or chapel, which the emperor Tiberius dedicated to the &quot;gens Julia&quot; in the town, and in which he placed the statue of Augustus. Some of the Julii may have settled at Bovillae after the fall of Alba Longa.

As it became the fashion in the later times of the Republic to claim a divine origin for the most distinguished of the Roman gentes, it was contended that Iulus, the mythical ancestor of the race, was the same as Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, and founder of Alba Longa. Aeneas was, in turn, the son of Venus and Anchises. In order to prove the identity of Ascanius and Iulus, recourse was had to etymology, some specimens of which the reader curious in such matters will find in Servius. Other traditions held that Iulus was the son of Aeneas by his Trojan wife, Creusa, while Ascanius was the son of Aeneas and Lavinia, daughter of Latinus.

The dictator Caesar frequently alluded to the divine origin of his race, as, for instance, in the funeral oration which he pronounced when quaestor over his aunt Julia, and in giving &quot;Venus Genetrix&quot; as the word to his soldiers at the battles of Pharsalus and Munda; and subsequent writers and poets were ready enough to fall in with a belief which flattered the pride and exalted the origin of the imperial family.

Though it would seem that the Julii first came to Rome in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the name occurs in Roman legend as early as the time of Romulus. It was Proculus Julius who was said to have informed the sorrowing Roman people, after the strange departure of Romulus from the world, that their king had descended from heaven and appeared to him, bidding him tell the people to honor him in future as a god, under the name of Quirinus. Some modern critics have inferred from this, that a few of the Julii might have settled in Rome in the reign of the first king; but considering the entirely fabulous nature of the tale, and the circumstance that the celebrity of the Julia gens in later times would easily lead to its connection with the earliest times of Roman story, no historical argument can be drawn from the mere name occurring in this legend.

In the later Empire, the distinction between praenomen, nomen, and cognomen was gradually lost, and &quot;Julius&quot; was treated much like a personal name, which it ultimately became. The Latin form is common in many languages, but other familiar forms exist, including &quot;Giulio&quot; (Italian), &quot;Julio&quot; (Spanish), &quot;Jules&quot; (French), &quot;Júlio&quot; (Portuguese), &quot;Iuliu&quot; (Romanian) and &quot;Юлий&quot; (&quot;Yuliy&quot;, Bulgarian and Russian).

==Praenomina==
The Julii of the Republic used the praenomina &quot;Lucius, Gaius, and Sextus&quot;. There are also instances of &quot;Vopiscus&quot; and &quot;Spurius&quot; in the early generations of the family. The earliest of the Julii appearing in legend bore the praenomen &quot;Proculus&quot;, and it is possible that this name was used by some of the early Julii, although no later examples are known. In the later Republic and imperial times, &quot;Vopiscus&quot; and &quot;Proculus&quot; were generally used as personal cognomina.

The gens was always said to have descended from and been named after a mythical personage named &quot;Iulus&quot; or &quot;Iullus&quot;, even before he was asserted to be the son of Aeneas; and it is entirely possible that &quot;Iulus&quot; was an ancient praenomen, which had fallen out of use by the early Republic, and was preserved as a cognomen by the eldest branch of the Julii. The name was later revived as a praenomen by Marcus Antonius, the triumvir, who had a son named &quot;Iulus&quot;. Classical Latin did not distinguish between the letters &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot;, which were both written with &quot;I&quot;, and for this reason the name is sometimes written &quot;Julus&quot;, just as &quot;Julius&quot; is also written &quot;Iulius&quot;.

The many Julii of imperial times, who were not descended from the gens Julia, did not limit themselves to the praenomina of that family. The imperial family set the example by freely mingling the praenomina of the Julii with those of the gens Claudia, using titles and cognomina as praenomina, and regularly changing their praenomina to reflect the political winds of the empire.

==Branches and cognomina==

The family-names of the Julii in the time of the Republic are &quot;Caesar&quot;, &quot;Iulus&quot;, &quot;Mento&quot;, and &quot;Libo&quot;, of which the first three are undoubtedly patrician; but the only families which were particularly celebrated were those of &quot;Iulus&quot; and &quot;Caesar&quot;, the former at the beginning and the latter in the last century of the Republic. On coins the only names found are &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Bursio&quot;, the latter of which does not occur in ancient writers.

Due to the activity of Julius Caesar in Gaul over many years, a number of natives of the Gallic provinces adopted &quot;Julius&quot; as their gentilicum, and have no other connection to the Republican Julii. Examples of their descendants include Julius Florus, and Gaius Julius Civilis. Other Julii are descended from the numerous freedmen, and it may have been assumed by some out of vanity and ostentation.

===Iullus===
&quot;Iullus&quot;, also written as &quot;Iulus&quot; and &quot;Jullus&quot;, was the surname of the eldest branch of the Julii to appear in Roman history. The gens claimed descent from Iulus, who was in some manner connected with Aeneas, although the traditions differed with respect to the details.

In some accounts, Iulus was the son of Aeneas and Creüsa, who came to Latium from the ruins of Troy, together with his father and others seeking a land in which to settle. In others, Ascanius was the son of Creüsa, while Iulus was the son of Lavinia, daughter of Latinus, the king of Latium with whom Aeneas made peace after landing in Italy. In still different accounts, Iulus was the son not of Aeneas, but of Ascanius.

Perhaps an indigenous origin of the name is suggested by the &quot;De Origo Gentis Romanae&quot; of Aurelius Victor, in which Iulus and Ascanius are identical. Described as the son of Jupiter, he was originally known as &quot;Jobus&quot;, and then &quot;Julus&quot;. This calls to mind the use of &quot;Jove&quot; for Jupiter, and the &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot; suggests that &quot;Iulus&quot; might be a diminutive of &quot;Dius&quot;, which is also the root of &quot;Jupiter&quot;. Furthermore, Livy reports that after his death Aeneas was worshiped as &quot;Jupiter Indiges&quot;, &quot;the local Jove&quot;. This suggests the early fusion of the Aeneas story with a local cult hero, said to have been the son of Jupiter.

Irrespective of the historicity of the Iulus of Roman myth, there is little reason to doubt that &quot;Iullus&quot; was an ancient personal name, perhaps even a praenomen, and that &quot;Julius&quot; is a patronymic surname built upon it. &quot;Iullus&quot; seems to be the original and better attested spelling, although the trisyllabic form &quot;Iulus&quot; became common after Vergil introduced it in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

===Libo===
During the century and a half between the last records of the Julii Iuli and the first appearance of the Julii Caesares, we encounter a Lucius Julius Libo, consul in BC 267. Chase translates his surname as &quot;sprinkler&quot;, deriving it from &quot;libare&quot;, and suggests that it might originally have signified the libation pourer at religious ceremonies. It is not certain whether the name was personal, or whether the consul inherited it from his father and grandfather, of whom all we know is that they were named Lucius. Some scholars have supposed that Libo was descended from the Julii Iuli, and that Lucius, the father of Sextus Julius Caesar, was his son; but the evidence is very slight.

===Caesar===
The &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot; says this of the cognomen &quot;Caesar&quot;:
It is uncertain which member of the Julia gens first obtained the surname of &quot;Caesar&quot;, but the first who occurs in history is Sextus Julius Caesar, praetor in BC 208. The origin of the name is equally uncertain. Spartianus, in his life of Aelius Verus, mentions four different opinions respecting its origin:
#That the word signified an elephant in the language of the Moors, and was given as a surname to one of the Julii because he had killed an elephant.
#That it was given to one of the Julii because he had been cut (&quot;caesus&quot;) out of his mother&#x27;s womb after her death; or
#Because he had been born with a great quantity of hair (&quot;caesaries&quot;) on his head; or
#Because he had azure-colored (&quot;caesii&quot;) eyes of an almost supernatural kind.
Of these opinions, the third, which is also given by Festus, seems to come nearest the truth. &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;caesaries&quot; are both probably connected with the Sanskrit &quot;kêsa&quot;, &quot;hair&quot;, and it is quite in accordance with the Roman custom for a surname to be given to an individual from some peculiarity in his personal appearance. The second opinion, which seems to have been the most popular one with the ancient writers, arose without doubt from a false etymology. With respect to the first, which was the one adopted, says Spartianus, by the most learned men, it is impossible to disprove it absolutely, as we know next to nothing of the ancient Moorish language; but it has no inherent probability in it; and the statement of Servius is undoubtedly false, that the grandfather of the dictator obtained the surname on account of killing an elephant with his own hand in Africa, as there were several of the Julii with this name before his time.

An inquiry into the etymology of this name is of some interest, as no other name has ever obtained such celebrity — &quot;clarum et duraturum cum aeternitate mundi nomen.&quot; It was assumed by Augustus as the adopted son of the dictator, and was by Augustus handed down to his adopted son Tiberius. It continued to be used by Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, as members either by adoption or female descent of Caesar&#x27;s family; but though the family became extinct with Nero, succeeding emperors still retained it as part of their titles, and it was the practice to prefix it to their own name, as for instance, &quot;Imperator Caesar Domitianus Augustus&quot;. When Hadrian adopted Aelius Verus, he allowed the latter to take the title of &quot;Caesar&quot;; and from this time, though the title of &quot;Augustus&quot; continued to be confined to the reigning prince, that of &quot;Caesar&quot; was also granted to the second person in the state and the heir presumptive to the throne.

<text>Donald Olding Hebb (July 22, 1904 – August 20, 1985) was a Canadian psychologist who was influential in the area of neuropsychology, where he sought to understand how the function of neurons contributed to psychological processes such as learning. He is best known for his theory of Hebbian learning, which he introduced in his classic 1949 work &quot;The Organization of Behavior&quot;. He has been described as the father of neuropsychology and neural networks. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Hebb as the 19th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. His views on learning described behavior and thought in terms of brain function, explaining cognitive processes in terms of connections between neuron assemblies.

==Early life==
Donald Hebb was born in Chester, Nova Scotia, the oldest of four children of Arthur M. and M. Clara (Olding) Hebb, and lived there until the age of 16, when his parents moved to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

Hebb&#x27;s parents were both medical doctors. Donald&#x27;s mother was heavily influenced by the ideas of Maria Montessori, and she home-schooled him until the age of 8. He performed so well in elementary school that he was promoted to the 7th grade at 10 years of age but, as a result of failing and then repeating the 11th grade in Chester, he graduated from the 12th grade at 16 years of age from Halifax County Academy. (Many or most of the single class of grade 9, 10 and 11 students at the Chester school failed the provincial examinations. Those in 9th and 10th grades were permitted to advance despite their failure but there was no 12th grade in Chester.) He entered Dalhousie University aiming to become a novelist. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1925. Afterward, he became a teacher, teaching at his old school in Chester. Later, he worked on a farm in Alberta and then traveled around, working as a laborer in Quebec.

==Career==
In 1928, he became a graduate student at McGill University. But, at the same time, he was appointed headmaster of Verdun High School in the suburbs of Montreal. He worked with two colleagues from the university, Kellogg and Clarke, to improve the situation. He took a more innovative approach to education—for example, assigning more interesting schoolwork and sending anyone misbehaving outside (making schoolwork a privilege). He completed his master&#x27;s degree in psychology at McGill in 1932 under the direction of the eminent psychologist Boris Babkin. Hebb&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis, entitled &quot;Conditioned and Unconditioned Reflexes and Inhibition&quot;, tried to show that skeletal reflexes were due to cellular learning.

By the beginning of 1934, Hebb&#x27;s life was in a slump. His wife had died, following a car accident, on his twenty-ninth birthday (July 22, 1933). His work at the Montreal school was going badly. In his words, it was &quot;defeated by the rigidity of the curriculum in Quebec&#x27;s protestant schools.&quot; The focus of study at McGill was more in the direction of education and intelligence, and Hebb was now more interested in physiological psychology and was critical of the methodology of the experiments there.

He decided to leave Montreal and wrote to Robert Yerkes at Yale, where he was offered a position to study for a PhD. Babkin, however, convinced Hebb to study instead with Karl Lashley at the University of Chicago.

In July 1934, Hebb was accepted to study under Karl Lashley at the University of Chicago. His thesis was titled &quot;The problem of spatial orientation and place learning&quot;. Hebb, along with two other students, followed Lashley to Harvard University in September 1935. Here, he had to change his thesis. At Harvard, he did his thesis research on the effects of early visual deprivation upon size and brightness perception in a rat. That is, he raised rats in the dark and some in the light and compared their brains. In 1936, he received his PhD from Harvard. The following year he worked as a research assistant to Lashley and as a teaching assistant in introductory psychology for Edwin G. Boring at Radcliffe College. His Harvard thesis was soon published, and he finished the thesis he started at University of Chicago.

In 1937, Hebb married his second wife, Elizabeth Nichols Donovan. That same year, on a tip from his sister Catherine (herself a PhD student with Babkin at McGill University), he applied to work with Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Here he researched the effect of brain surgery and injury on human brain function. He saw that the brain of a child could regain partial or full function when a portion of it is removed but that similar damage in an adult could be far more damaging, even catastrophic. From this, he deduced the prominent role that external stimulation played in the thought processes of adults. In fact, the lack of this stimulation, he showed, caused diminished function and sometimes hallucinations.

He also became critical of the Stanford-Binet and Wechsler intelligence tests for use with brain surgery patients. These tests were designed to measure overall intelligence, whereas Hebb believed tests should be designed to measure more specific effects that surgery could have had on the patient. Together with N.W. Morton, he created the Adult Comprehension Test and the Picture Anomaly Test.

Putting the Picture Anomaly Test to use, he provided the first indication that the right temporal lobe was involved in visual recognition. He also showed that removal of large parts of the frontal lobe had little effect on intelligence. In fact, in one adult patient, who had a large portion of his frontal lobes removed in order to treat his epilepsy, he noted &quot;a striking post-operative improvement in personality and intellectual capacity.&quot; From these sorts of results, he started to believe that the frontal lobes were instrumental in learning only early in life.

In 1939, he was appointed to a teaching position at Queen&#x27;s University. In order to test his theory of the changing role of the frontal lobes with age, he designed a variable path maze for rats with Kenneth Williams called the Hebb-Williams maze, a method for testing animal intelligence later used in countless studies. He used the maze to test the intelligence of rats blinded at different developmental stages, showing that &quot;there is a lasting effect of infant experience on the problem-solving ability of the adult rat.&quot; This became one of the main principles of developmental psychology, later helping those arguing the importance of the proposed Head Start programs for preschool children in economically poor neighborhoods.

In 1942, he moved to Orange Park, Florida to once again work with Karl Lashley who had replaced Yerkes as the Director of the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Here, studying primate behavior, Hebb developed emotional tests for chimpanzees. The experiments were somewhat unsuccessful, however because chimpanzees turned out to be hard to teach. During the course of the work there, Hebb wrote &quot;The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory&quot;, his groundbreaking book that set forth the theory that the only way to explain behavior was in terms of brain function.

Afterward, he returned to McGill University to become a professor of psychology in 1947 and was made chairman of the department in 1948. Here he once again worked with Penfield, but this time through his students, which included Mortimer Mishkin, Haldor Enger Rosvold, and Brenda Milner, all of whom extended his earlier work with Penfield on the human brain.

His wife Elizabeth died in 1962. In 1966, Hebb married his third wife, Margaret Doreen Wright (née Williamson), a widow.

Hebb remained at McGill until retirement in 1972. He remained at McGill after retirement for a few years, in the Department of Psychology as an emeritus professor, conducting a seminar course required of all department graduate students.

In 1977 Hebb retired to his birthplace in Nova Scotia, where he completed his last book, &quot;Essay on Mind&quot;. He was appointed an honorary professor of psychology at his alma mater, Dalhousie, and regularly participated in colloquia there until his death at 81, in 1985. He was survived by two daughters (both by his second marriage), Mary Ellen Hebb and Jane Hebb Paul.

==Honors and awards==
Hebb was a member of both the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) and the American Psychological Association (APA). He was elected President of the CPA in 1953 and of the APA in 1960. He won the APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1961.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in March 1966.

He received an honorary doctorate from 15 universities, including in 1961 from University of Chicago, in 1965 from Dalhousie University and in 1975 from Concordia University.

The Donald O. Hebb Award, named in his honor, is awarded by the Canadian Psychological Association to distinguished Canadian psychologists. The award is presented yearly to a person who has made a significant contribution to promoting the discipline of psychology as a science by conducting research, by teaching and leadership, or as a spokesperson. The inaugural award was presented to Hebb in 1980.

In 2011 he was posthumously inducted into the Halifax, Nova Scotia, Discovery Centre&#x27;s Hall of Fame. At a 2011 meeting of the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), Hebb was selected for inclusion in CSI&#x27;s Pantheon of Skeptics, an award given to deceased fellows of CSI.

His archives, including records relating to research and teaching activities, are held by the McGill University Archives, McGill University, in Montreal.

==Work==

===&quot;The Organization of Behavior&quot; (1949)===
&quot;The Organization of Behavior&quot; is considered Hebb&#x27;s most significant contribution to the field of neuroscience. A combination of his years of work in brain surgery mixed with his study of human behavior, it finally brought together the two realms of human perception that for a long time could not be connected properly, that is, it connected the biological function of the brain as an organ together with the higher function of the mind.

In 1929, Hans Berger discovered that the brain exhibits continuous electrical activity and cast doubt on the Pavlovian model of perception and response because, now, there appeared to be something going on in the brain even without much stimulus.

At the same time, there were many mysteries. For example, if there was a method for the brain to recognize a circle, how does it recognize circles of various sizes or imperfect roundness? To accommodate every single possible circle that could exist, the brain would need a far greater capacity than it has.

Another theory, the Gestalt theory, stated that signals to the brain established a sort of field. The form of this field depended only on the pattern of the inputs, but it still could not explain how this field was understood by the mind.

The behaviorist theories at the time did well at explaining how the processing of patterns happened. However, they could not account for how these patterns made it into the mind.

Hebb combined up-to-date data about behavior and the brain into a single theory. And, while the understanding of the anatomy of the brain did not advance much since the development of the older theories on the operation of the brain, he was still able to piece together a theory that got a lot of the important functions of the brain right.

Hebb&#x27;s theory became known as Hebbian theory and the models which follow this theory are said to exhibit &quot;Hebbian learning.&quot; He proposed a neurophysiological account of learning and memory based in a simple principle:

This is often paraphrased as &quot;Neurons that fire together wire together.&quot; It is commonly referred to as Hebb&#x27;s Law.

The combination of neurons which could be grouped together as one processing unit, Hebb referred to as &quot;cell-assemblies&quot;. And their combination of connections made up the ever-changing algorithm which dictated the brain&#x27;s response to stimuli.

Not only did Hebb&#x27;s model for the working of the mind influence how psychologists understood the processing of stimuli within the mind but also it opened up the way for the creation of computational machines that mimicked the biological processes of a living nervous system. And while the dominant form of synaptic transmission in the nervous system was later found to be chemical, modern artificial neural networks are still based on the transmission of signals via electrical impulses that Hebbian theory was first designed around.

==Theories of education==

Hebb was instrumental in defining psychology as a biological science by identifying thought as the integrated activity of the brain. His views on learning described behavior and thought in terms of brain function, explaining cognitive processes in terms of connections between neuron assemblies. These ideas played a large part in his views on education and learning.

Hebb viewed motivation and learning as related properties. He believed that everything in the brain was interrelated and worked together. His theory was that everything we experience in our environment fires a set of neurons called a cell assembly. This cell assembly is the brain&#x27;s thoughts or ideas. These cell assemblies then work together to form phase sequences, which are streams of thoughts. Once these cell assemblies and phase sequences are formed, they can be activated by stimulation from the environment. Therefore, the more stimulating and rich the environment, the more the cell assemblies grow and learn. This theory played into his beliefs in education. Hebb believed that the environment was very important to learning in children. Children learn by building up these cell assemblies and phase sequences. An enriched environment with varied opportunities for sensory and motor experiences contribute to children developing the cell assemblies and phase sequences necessary for continued learning in adulthood. To attempt to prove this, Hebb and his daughters raised pet rats at home. By raising them in an enriched environment, the rats showed improved maze learning in adulthood. This research into environmental enrichment contributed to the development of the Head Start Program used today.

Head Start is a program for preschool children in low-income families. The aim of the program is to prepare children for success in school through an early learning program providing cognitively stimulating educational activities. According to the findings in a study on Head Start participation and school readiness, full-time Head Start participation was associated with higher academic skills in children of less-educated parents.

Another long-term study by Hart and Risley tracked 42 children and their families over two years. The study focused on early language acquisition and the role of the home and family in the growth of word learning and language development. The results of their study showed that two of the most important aspects in language acquisition are the economic advantages of the children&#x27;s homes and the frequency of language experiences. The study demonstrated that children of lower socioeconomic status homes, with fewer economic resources, learn fewer words and acquire vocabulary more slowly than children of professional parents with a higher socioeconomic status with access to more varied and enriched vocabulary experiences.

Hebb believed that providing an enriched environment for childhood learning would benefit adult learning as well, since a second type of learning occurs as adults. This second type of learning is a more rapid and insightful learning because the cell assemblies and phase sequences have already been created and now can be rearranged in any number of ways. The Hebbian theory of learning implies that every experience a person encounters becomes set into the network of brain cells. Then, each time a certain action or thought is repeated, the connection between neurons is strengthened, changing the brain and strengthening the learning. An individual is, in essence, training their brain. The more challenging new experiences a person has and practices, the more new connections are created in their brain.

===Hebb as an educator===
Throughout his life Hebb enjoyed teaching and was very successful as a teacher. Both in his early years as a teacher and a headmaster in a Montreal school and in his later years at McGill University, he proved to be a very effective educator and a great influence on the scientific thinking of his students.

As a professor at McGill, he believed that one could not teach motivation, but rather create the conditions necessary for students under which to do their study and research. One could train them to write, help them choose a problem to study, and even help keep them from being distracted, but the motivation and passion for research and study had to come from the students themselves. He believed that students should be evaluated on their ability to think and create rather than their ability to memorize and reprocess older ideas.

Hebb believed in a very objective study of the human mind, more as a study of a biological science. This attitude toward psychology and the way it is taught made McGill University a prominent center of psychological study.

Hebb also came up with the A/S ratio, a value that measures the brain complexity of an organism.

===Controversial research===

Hebb&#x27;s name has often been invoked in discussions of the involvement of psychological researchers in interrogation techniques, including the use of sensory deprivation, because of his research into this field. Speaking at a Harvard symposium on sensory deprivation in June 1958, Hebb is quoted as remarking:

Recent research has argued that Hebb&#x27;s sensory deprivation research was funded by and coordinated with the CIA (with the CIA intending to use the research to develop new interrogation and torture techniques). Some of this research was done in secret, and the results were initially shared only with United States authorities. Some of this research involved volunteers who spent hours in sensory deprivation conditions that some argue should be considered torture, although the subjects in his studies were university student volunteers, not patients, and were free to quit the experiment at any time.

<text>Henri La Fontaine (; 22 April 1854 – 14 May 1943), was a Belgian international lawyer and president of the International Peace Bureau. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1913 because &quot;he was the effective leader of the peace movement in Europe.&quot;

==Biography==
La Fontaine was born in Brussels on 22 April 1854 and studied law at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Université libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). He was admitted to the bar in 1877 and established a reputation as an authority on international law. He and his sister Léonie La Fontaine were early advocates for women&#x27;s rights and suffrage, founding in 1890 the Belgian League for the Rights of Women. In 1893, he became professor of international law at the Free University of Brussels and two years later was elected to the Belgian Senate as a member of the Socialist Party. He served as vice chairman of the Senate from 1919 to 1932.

La Fontaine took an early interest in the International Peace Bureau, founded in 1882, and was influential in the Bureau&#x27;s efforts to bring about The Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907. He served as president of the Bureau from 1907 until his death in 1943. World War I convinced La Fontaine that the world would establish an international court when peace returned. He proposed a number of possible members, including Joseph Hodges Choate, Elihu Root, Charles William Eliot, and Andrew Dickson White. La Fontaine also promoted the idea of unification of the world&#x27;s pacifist organizations.

He was a member of the Belgian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and to the League of Nations Assembly (1920–21). In other efforts to foster world peace, he founded the Centre Intellectuel Mondial (later merged into the League of Nations Institute for Intellectual Co-operation) and proposed such organizations as a world school and university, and a world parliament. In 1907, with Paul Otlet, he founded the Union of International Associations. He also is the co-founder of Institut International de Bibliographie (which later became the International Federation for Information and Documentation, FID) along with Paul Otlet. It was in this role that he and Otlet attended the World Congress of Universal Documentation in 1937.

Henri La Fontaine was a freemason, and a member of the lodge &quot;Les Amis Philanthropes&quot; in Brussels. He died on 14 May 1943 in Brussels.

==Works==
Henri La Fontaine was the author of a number of legal handbooks and a documentary history of international arbitration:
* &quot;Les droits et des obligations des entrepreneurs de travaux publics&quot; (1885)
* &quot;Traité de la contrefaçon&quot; (1888)
* &quot;Pasicrisie internationale&quot; (1902)
* &quot;Bibliographie de la Paix et de l&#x27;Arbitrage&quot; (1904)
He was also founder of the review &quot;La Vie Internationale&quot;.

<doc id="323127" wikidata="Q911169" url="?curid=323127" title="Danubian culture">
<text>The term Danubian [[archaeological culture|culture]] was coined by the Australian archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe to describe the first agrarian society in Central Europe and Eastern Europe. It covers the Linear Pottery culture (Linearbandkeramik, LBK), stroked pottery and Rössen cultures. 

The beginning of the Linear Pottery culture dates to around 5500 BC. It appears to have spread westwards along the valley of the river Danube and interacted with the cultures of Atlantic Europe when they reached the Paris Basin.

Danubian I peoples cleared forests and cultivated fertile loess soils from the Balkans to the Low Countries and the Paris Basin. They made LBK pottery and kept domesticated cows, pigs, dogs, sheep, and goats. The characteristic tool of the culture is the shoe-last celt, a kind of long thin stone adze which was used to fell trees and sometimes as a weapon, evidenced by the skulls found at Talheim, Neckar in Germany and Schletz in Austria. Settlements consisted of longhouses. According to a theory by Eduard Sangmeister, these settlements were abandoned, possibly as fertile land was exhausted, and then reoccupied perhaps when the land had lain fallow for long enough. In contrast, Peter Modderman and Jens Lüning believe the settlements were constantly inhabited, with individual families using specific plots (Hofplätze). They also imported spondylus shells from the Mediterranean.

A second wave of the culture, which used painted pottery with Asiatic influences, superseded the first phase starting around 4500 BC. This was followed by a third wave which used stroke-ornamented ware.

Danubian sites include those at Bylany in Bohemia and Köln-Lindenthal in Germany.

<text>Gwangju (; ), formerly romanized as Kwangju, is South Korea&#x27;s sixth-largest metropolis. It is a designated metropolitan city under the direct control of the central government&#x27;s Home Minister. The city was also the capital of South Jeolla Province until the provincial office moved to the southern village of Namak in Muan County in 2005 because Gwangju was promoted to a metropolitan city and was independent of South Jeolla Province.

Its name is composed of the words &quot;gwang&quot; () meaning &quot;light&quot; and &quot;ju&quot; () meaning &quot;province&quot;. Gwangju was historically recorded as &quot;Muju&quot; (), in which &quot;Silla merged all of the land to establish the provinces of Gwangju, Ungju, Jeonju, Muju and various counties, plus the southern boundary of Goguryeo and the ancient territories of Silla&quot; in the &quot;Samguk sagi.&quot; In the heart of the agricultural Jeolla region, the city is also famous for its rich and diverse cuisine.

== History ==

The city was established in 57 BC. It was one of the administrative centers of Baekje during the Three Kingdoms period.

During the Imperial Japanese rule, the city was known as Kōshū. In 1929, a confrontation between Korean and Japanese students in the city turned into Gwangju Student Independence Movement, a regional demonstration, which culminated in one of the major nationwide uprisings against Imperial Japanese cruelty during the colonial period.

The modern industry was established in Gwangju with the construction of a railway to Seoul. Some of the industries that took hold include cotton textiles, rice mills and breweries. Construction of a designated industrial zone in 1967 encouraged growth in industry, especially in the sectors linked to the automobile industry.

In May 1980, peaceful demonstrations took place in Gwangju against Chun Doo-hwan, leader of the military coup d&#x27;état of 12 December 1979. The demonstrations were suppressed by military forces, including elite units of the Special Operations Command. The situation escalated after a violent crackdown, resulting in the Gwangju Uprising, where civilians raided armories and armed themselves. By the time the uprising was suppressed 9 days later, many hundreds of civilians and several police forces / soldiers were dead. After civilian rule was reinstated in 1987, a national cemetery was established to honor the victims of the incident.

In 1986, Gwangju separated from South Jeolla Province to become a Directly Governed City (Jikhalsi), and then became a Metropolitan City (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995.

Due to a variety of factors, including the ancient rivalry between Baekje and Silla, as well as the biased priority given to the Gyeongsang Province region by political leaders in the 2nd half of the 20th century, Gwangju has a long history of voting for left-leaning politicians and is the main stronghold for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea along with its predecessors, as well as the progressive Justice Party.

Gwangju has held many sports events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2015 Summer Universiade, 2019 World Aquatics Championships.

== Administrative divisions ==

Gwangju is divided into 5 districts (&quot;Gu&quot;).

== Demographics ==
According to the census of 2015, 9.5% of the population followed Buddhism and 28.7% followed Christianity (20% Protestantism and 8.7% Catholicism) 61% of the population are irreligious.

One of the largest ethnic enclaves of Koryo-saram (ethnic Koreans of the former Soviet Union) in South Korea is located in Gwangju: the Gwangju Koryoin Village. Schools in the vicinity of the village, such as , have significant proportions of Russian speakers as a result.

== Climate ==
Gwangju has a cooler version of the humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa/Cwa&quot;) with four distinct seasons and rainfall year-round but particularly during the East Asian Monsoon Season in the summer months.

Winters, while still somewhat cold, are milder than in Seoul and cities further north due to the city&#x27;s southwesterly position in the Korean peninsula.
Summers are hot and humid with abundant precipitation, particularly in the form of thunderstorms. Gwangju is one of the warmest cities in Korea in the summer due to its geographic location.

== Education ==
Chonnam National University, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, and Gwangju Education University are public universities in Gwangju.

Honam University, Gwangju University, Gwangshin University, Gwangju Women&#x27;s University, Nambu University, Chosun University, and Honam Christian University are private universities.

Gwangju Health University is a private community college offering associate degrees in humanities and social sciences, healthcare sciences, and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in nursing.

Gwangju has 593 schools, consisting of 234 kindergartens, 145 elementary schools, 84 middle schools, 65 high schools, 1 science high school, 7 junior colleges, 9 universities, 38 graduate schools, and 11 others (as of 1 May 2009) with a total of 406,669 students, or 28.5% of the total city population. The average number of students per household is 0.8.

== Transportation ==
The city is served by the Gwangju Subway. An extension was completed in April 2008 with the remainder being completed in 2012. The first phase of a second line, which, when completed, will be an orbital loop line, will open in 2026. There are two KTX stations in the city: Gwangju station and Gwangju Songjeong Station. Gwangju Songjeong Station connects to the Gwangju Subway and local bus system. Now the Songjeong station is mainly used.

Gwangju has an extensive system of public buses that traverse the city. Bus stops and buses themselves contain stop information in Korean and in English. Local buses, but not the subway or KTX, connect to the intercity Gwangju Bus Terminal known as U-Square.

Gwangju is also served by the Gwangju Airport.

<text>James Gunn (March 6, 1843 – November 5, 1911) was a one-term U. S. Congressman from the state of Idaho.

==Biography==
Born in County Fermanagh, Ireland, Gunn emigrated to the United States with his parents while he was very young. The family settled in Wisconsin where he attended the common schools. James later attended the Notre Dame Academy in Indiana and taught school briefly before the Civil War.

In 1862, Gunn enlisted in the 27th Wisconsin Infantry and served with them for the remainder of the war. By the time he was discharged in October 1865, he was a Captain. He briefly studied law, but never practiced, and, in 1866, he headed west.

In the West, he followed opportunity and lived for a while in Gilpin County and Georgetown, Colorado. He also worked in Virginia City, Nevada, and in California before settling in Hailey, Idaho, in 1881. At Hailey, he went into the newspaper business, publishing the &quot;Wood River Valley Sentinel&quot;.

Gunn became a member of the Populist Party, and stood for office several times. When Idaho became a state in 1890, Gunn was elected to the Idaho State Senate.

He also served as editor of the &quot;Boise Sentinel&quot; until elected to the state&#x27;s at-large seat in Congress.
Gunn ran for the seat four times; in 1892, 1894, 1896, and 1898, but only his 1896 race was successful. He defeated Boise attorney William Borah, who later served over 32 years as a U.S. Senator (1907–40). Gunn lost his bid for re-election in 1898 to Edgar Wilson, a Silver Republican, whom had preceded Gunn in office as a Republican.

Gunn later was the commandant of the Idaho Soldiers&#x27; Home in 1901–03. He died in 1911 and is buried at Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise.

<text>Donald Eugene Gibson (April 3, 1928 – November 17, 2003) was an American songwriter and country musician. A Country Music Hall of Fame inductee, Gibson wrote such country standards as &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, and enjoyed a string of country hits (&quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot;) from 1957 into the mid-1970s.

Gibson was nicknamed &quot;The Sad Poet&quot; because he frequently wrote songs that told of loneliness and lost love.

==Early days==

Don Gibson was born in Shelby, North Carolina, United States, into a poor working-class family. He dropped out of school in the second grade.

==Career==
His first band was called Sons of the Soil, with whom he made his first recording for Mercury Records in 1949. In 1957, he journeyed to Nashville to work with producer Chet Atkins and record his self-penned songs &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; for RCA Victor. The afternoon session resulted in a double-sided hit on both the country and pop charts. &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; set the pattern for a long series of other RCA hits. &quot;Blue Blue Day&quot;, recorded prior to &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me&quot; was a number 1 hit in 1958. Later singles included &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Blue&quot; (1958), &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Your Troubles&quot; (1959), &quot;Sea of Heartbreak&quot; (1961); &quot;Lonesome No. 1&quot;, &quot;I Can Mend Your Broken Heart&quot; (1962), and &quot;Woman (Sensuous Woman)&quot;, a number one country hit in 1972.

Gibson recorded a series of successful duets with Dottie West in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the most successful of which were the Number two country hit &quot;Rings of Gold&quot; (1969) and the top 10 hit &quot;There&#x27;s a Story Goin&#x27; Round&quot; (1970). West and Gibson released an album together in 1969, titled &quot;Dottie and Don&quot;. He also recorded several duets with Sue Thompson, among these being the Top 40 hits, &quot;I Think They Call It Love&quot; (1972), &quot;Good Old Fashioned Country Love&quot; (1974) and &quot;Oh, How Love Changes&quot; (1975).

His song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, has been recorded by over 700 artists, most notably by Ray Charles in 1962. He also wrote and recorded &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, a song that would become a major 1963 crossover hit for Patsy Cline. Roy Orbison was a fan of Gibson&#x27;s songwriting, and in 1967, he recorded an album of his songs simply titled &quot;Roy Orbison Sings Don Gibson&quot;. Gibson&#x27;s wide appeal was also shown in Neil Young&#x27;s recorded version of &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; on his 1970 album, &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, which is one of the few songs Young has recorded that he did not write.

==Personal life==
Don married Bobbi Patterson in 1967. He died of natural causes on November 17, 2003.
==Legacy==
Gibson was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1973. In 2001 he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2010.

===The Don Gibson Theater===
Located in Cleveland County, North Carolina, The Don Gibson Theater opened in November 2009 in historic uptown Shelby.

<doc id="323135" wikidata="Q20927" url="?curid=323135" title="Daegu">
<text>Daegu (; ), formerly spelled Taegu and officially Daegu Metropolitan City (), is a city in southeastern South Korea.

Daegu is the third-largest urban agglomeration in South Korea after Seoul and Busan; it is the fourth-largest metropolitan city in the nation with over 2.3 million residents; and the second-largest city after Busan in the Yeongnam region in southeastern South Korea. Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population of over 5 million.

Daegu is located in south-eastern Korea about from the coast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang Province. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang Province, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.

Daegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s–1980s period. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, &quot;Apple City&quot;. Daegu is also known as &quot;Textile City&quot;. Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu currently focuses on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.

Daegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and the 2003 Summer Universiade. It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

==History==
===Prehistory and early history===
Archaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun pottery period (around 1500–300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong. Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated. The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850–550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.

Ancient historical texts indicate that during the Proto–Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.

===Silla===
Silla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Goguryeo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China&#x27;s Tang dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla&#x27;s King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so. This initiative is known only through a single line in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move&#x27;s failure. The city was given its current name in 757.

In the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu. The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.

===Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo===

During the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892–936, Daegu was initially aligned with Later Baekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Kŏn and those of Later Baekje under Kyŏn Hwŏn. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Kŏn himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Sin Sung-gyŏm. However, the atrocities of the Later Baekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Kŏn, who later became the king of Goryeo.

Numerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are &quot;Ansim&quot;, which literally means &quot;peace of mind&quot;, said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and &quot;Banwol&quot;, or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sung-gyŏm.

In the Goryeo period, the first edition of the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot; was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa. However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.

===Joseon===
Daegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon dynasty, being located in the middle of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan, at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.

In 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang Province, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, North Gyeongsang Province, and South Gyeongsang Province. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.

Daegu&#x27;s first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city&#x27;s west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.

===Korean Empire and colonial rule===

Japanese imperialism forcibly opened up Korea&#x27;s markets beginning in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country&#x27;s first modern post offices, as a part of the &#x27;Gab-o&#x27; reforms introduced in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese war.

Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.

In 1905, the old fortress wall was destroyed. As a tribute to the wall, streets that now run where the wall once stood have been named Bukseongno, Namseongno, Dongseongno and Seoseongno, which translates as &quot;north fortress street&quot;, &quot;south fortress street&quot;, &quot;east fortress street&quot; and &quot;west fortress street&quot; respectively.
Independence movements against imperial aggression flourished in Daegu, beginning as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was established in the town. As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, collecting many individual donations toward repaying the national debt. Rebellions continued after the 1910 annexation to Japan, notably during the March First Movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 citizens.

===After 1945===
In 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea. On October 1, Korean national police killed three student demonstrators and injured many others. It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.

Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu. In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month. As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread.

During the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so it remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. The fighting that prevented North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong River has become known as the Battle of Taegu.

In the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung Hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the People Power Party.

In the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (&quot;Jikhalsi&quot;), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (&quot;Gwangyeoksi&quot;) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.

Since 1990, Daegu has suffered two of South Korea&#x27;s worst mass casualty disasters: the 1995 Daegu gas explosions, which killed 101 people, and the 2003 Daegu subway fire, which killed 192 people.

In February 2020, Daegu was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.

In July 2023, the Gunwi County of North Gyeongsang Province was integrated into Daegu.

=== Mosque controversy ===
In December 2020, construction of a mosque in Daehyeon-dong for a Muslim community of 80-150 members comprising mainly staff and students of a local university, resulted in opposition from nearby residents who complained about the change in land use without prior consultation. Construction was halted in 2021 by the district administrative office (having originally been approved by the same office) after residents voiced concerns. This suspension was later judged by The National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRCK) to be based on discrimination and prejudice against Muslims. Insulting and offensive messages, considered by the NHRCK as akin to hate-speech, and the heads of pigs displayed within glass-fronted refrigerators, were subsequently left near the mosque construction site; the identity and precise motive of the culprits remain uncertain. Due to proximity to the mosque and its being seen as an intentional insult to Islam and the Muslim community, local residents were strongly criticized for holding a social barbeque/picnic in their neighbourhood in which pork (the most frequently eaten red meat in South Korea) was served. The approval for change of land use within a residential area without consultation with local residents indicates a failure by the local district office to adequately support both communities, and of the authorities to mediate effective communication between the two groups. Notably, the Muslim community did not disseminate information to the local residents on its plans, despite local awareness of Muslim worship within a house on the site since 2014, and general acceptance of what some residents saw as night-time disturbance during the time of Ramadan. Since the dispute began however, dialogue between the local residents and the Muslim community has been hampered by third parties in Korea, according to the Muslim community spokesperson. As of May 2023, construction was underway; differences had not been resolved.

==Politics==
Two local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. As a result, the provincial government office was relocated to Andong in January 2023. The mayor and heads of city&#x27;s eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the People Power Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced four Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Park Chung Hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo-hwan were born in other cities but they moved to Daegu and spent childhood in Daegu. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.

===Administrative divisions===
Daegu is divided into 7 districts (&quot;Gu&quot;) and 2 counties (&quot;Gun&quot;)

*Jung District ()
*Dong District ()
*Seo District ()
*Nam District ()
*Buk District ()
*Suseong District ()
*Dalseo District ()
*Dalseong County ()
*Gunwi County ()

==Geography==

===Topography===

Daegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains: Palgongsan to the north, Biseulsan to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The Geumho River flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.
===Climate===

The majority of Daegu lies in a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;). In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is and that for August, the warmest month, is . The city&#x27;s lowest record temperature was , and the city&#x27;s highest record temperature was . In 2014, high temperatures led to the emergence of a new term called Daefrica (대프리카, Daegu+Africa) starting with the internet community, and has been used in the media, broadcasting, etc. In 2015, a traffic cone in Daegu melted in the heat. Summers in Daegu are some of the hottest in the Korean peninsula. In 2023, on July 31 and August 3, median strips could not overcome the heat and melted in different parts of the same district in Daegu.

The climate of Gunwi County, which is the northern area of Daegu and was incorporated into Daegu from North Gyeongsang Province in July 2023, is quite different from most parts of Daegu. Gunwi straddles the borderline between a humid continental climate (&quot;Dwa&quot;) and a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;), and has colder winters than other areas of Daegu.
==Economy==

Daegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In 2021, Daegu had a regional GDP of $44,144 million. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.

The city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea&#x27;s trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO&#x27;s main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.

Historically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.

Additionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu&#x27;s economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.

Also, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu&#x27;s population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city&#x27;s fashion industry.

===Fashion industry===
Beginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the &#x27;Daegu: Fashion City&#x27;. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.

==Culture and sightseeing==

Generally, Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.

===Sights===
The most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one&#x27;s single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, North Gyeongsang Province.
On the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea&#x27;s only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon () and Nokdong-seowon () are also located in the suburbs.

Old villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (&quot;Gyeongju Choi&quot; clan&#x27;s original residence area) and the Inheung village (&quot;Nampyeong Mun&quot;&#x27;s). In the urban area, the Joseon period&#x27;s administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong () and Daegu-hyanggyo () also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.

Yangnyeongsi () in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.

Nearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa—a Buddhist temple that houses the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot; (a woodblock edition of the &quot;Tripitaka&quot; and one of the world&#x27;s oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, South Gyeongsang Province. The historic city of Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.

===Mountains and parks===


Mt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit. There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.

In the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city&#x27;s only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2·28 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.

===Downtown and shopping===

Dongseongno () is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu station to &quot;Jung-ang pachulso&quot; (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation&#x27;s third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul. In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.

Sub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo District is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. &quot;Deuran-gil&quot; (means the street inside the field) in Suseong District is known for many restaurants.

The city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.

===Festivals===
Many traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called &quot;Seokjeondaeje&quot; is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.

Lately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.

Various festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.

On August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.

Each year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/

Every May the &quot;Colorful Daegu Festival&quot; offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade. In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo District, Daegu. The term &quot;chimac&quot; is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning &quot;beer&quot;). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.

Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food, but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.

Daegu hosts three American military bases, Camp Henry, Camp George, and Camp Walker. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School, while Camp George has Daegu American School, the elementary and middle school for the bases (primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees).

<doc id="323137" wikidata="Q3283" url="?curid=323137" title="Geometric phase">
<text>In classical and quantum mechanics, geometric phase is a phase difference acquired over the course of a cycle, when a system is subjected to cyclic adiabatic processes, which results from the geometrical properties of the parameter space of the Hamiltonian. The phenomenon was independently discovered by S. Pancharatnam (1956), in classical optics and by H. C. Longuet-Higgins (1958) in molecular physics; it was generalized by Michael Berry in (1984). 
It is also known as the Pancharatnam–Berry phase, Pancharatnam phase, or Berry phase.
It can be seen in the conical intersection of potential energy surfaces and in the Aharonov–Bohm effect. Geometric phase around the conical intersection involving the ground electronic state of the C6H3F3+ molecular ion is discussed on pages 385–386 of the textbook by Bunker and Jensen. In the case of the Aharonov–Bohm effect, the adiabatic parameter is the magnetic field enclosed by two interference paths, and it is cyclic in the sense that these two paths form a loop. In the case of the conical intersection, the adiabatic parameters are the molecular coordinates. Apart from quantum mechanics, it arises in a variety of other wave systems, such as classical optics. As a rule of thumb, it can occur whenever there are at least two parameters characterizing a wave in the vicinity of some sort of singularity or hole in the topology; two parameters are required because either the set of nonsingular states will not be simply connected, or there will be nonzero holonomy.

Waves are characterized by amplitude and phase, and may vary as a function of those parameters. The geometric phase occurs when both parameters are changed simultaneously but very slowly (adiabatically), and eventually brought back to the initial configuration. In quantum mechanics, this could involve rotations but also translations of particles, which are apparently undone at the end. One might expect that the waves in the system return to the initial state, as characterized by the amplitudes and phases (and accounting for the passage of time). However, if the parameter excursions correspond to a loop instead of a self-retracing back-and-forth variation, then it is possible that the initial and final states differ in their phases. This phase difference is the geometric phase, and its occurrence typically indicates that the system&#x27;s parameter dependence is singular (its state is undefined) for some combination of parameters.

To measure the geometric phase in a wave system, an interference experiment is required. The Foucault pendulum is an example from classical mechanics that is sometimes used to illustrate the geometric phase. This mechanics analogue of the geometric phase is known as the Hannay angle.

==Berry phase in quantum mechanics ==
In a quantum system at the &quot;n&quot;-th eigenstate, an adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian sees the system remain in the &quot;n&quot;-th eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, while also obtaining a phase factor. The phase obtained has a contribution from the state&#x27;s time evolution and another from the variation of the eigenstate with the changing Hamiltonian. The second term corresponds to the Berry phase, and for non-cyclical variations of the Hamiltonian it can be made to vanish by a different choice of the phase associated with the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian at each point in the evolution.

However, if the variation is cyclical, the Berry phase cannot be cancelled; it is invariant and becomes an observable property of the system. By reviewing the proof of the adiabatic theorem given by Max Born and Vladimir Fock, in Zeitschrift für Physik 51, 165 (1928), we could characterize the whole change of the adiabatic process into a phase term. Under the adiabatic approximation, the coefficient of the &quot;n&quot;-th eigenstate under adiabatic process is given by
formula_1
where formula_2 is the Berry&#x27;s phase with respect to parameter &quot;t&quot;. Changing the variable &quot;t&quot; into generalized parameters, we could rewrite the Berry&#x27;s phase into
formula_3
where formula_4 parametrizes the cyclic adiabatic process. Note that the normalization of formula_5 implies that the integrand is imaginary, so that formula_6 is real. It follows a closed path formula_7 in the appropriate parameter space. Geometric phase along the closed path formula_7 can also be calculated by integrating the Berry curvature over surface enclosed by formula_7.

== Examples of geometric phases ==

=== Foucault pendulum ===

One of the easiest examples is the Foucault pendulum. An easy explanation in terms of geometric phases is given by Wilczek and Shapere:

To put it in different words, there are no inertial forces that could make the pendulum precess, so the precession (relative to the direction of motion of the path along which the pendulum is carried) is entirely due to the turning of this path. Thus the orientation of the pendulum undergoes parallel transport. For the original Foucault pendulum, the path is a circle of latitude, and by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, the phase shift is given by the enclosed solid angle.

==== Derivation ====

In a near-inertial frame moving in tandem with the Earth, but not sharing the rotation of the Earth about its own axis, the suspension point of the pendulum traces out a circular path during one sidereal day.

At the latitude of Paris, 48 degrees 51 minutes north, a full precession cycle takes just under 32 hours, so after one sidereal day, when the Earth is back in the same orientation as one sidereal day before, the oscillation plane has turned by just over 270 degrees. If the plane of swing was north–south at the outset, it is east–west one sidereal day later.

This also implies that there has been exchange of momentum; the Earth and the pendulum bob have exchanged momentum. The Earth is so much more massive than the pendulum bob that the Earth&#x27;s change of momentum is unnoticeable. Nonetheless, since the pendulum bob&#x27;s plane of swing has shifted, the conservation laws imply that an exchange must have occurred.

Rather than tracking the change of momentum, the precession of the oscillation plane can efficiently be described as a case of parallel transport. For that, it can be demonstrated, by composing the infinitesimal rotations, that the precession rate is proportional to the projection of the angular velocity of Earth onto the normal direction to Earth, which implies that the trace of the plane of oscillation will undergo parallel transport. After 24 hours, the difference between initial and final orientations of the trace in the Earth frame is , which corresponds to the value given by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. is also called the holonomy or geometric phase of the pendulum. When analyzing earthbound motions, the Earth frame is not an inertial frame, but rotates about the local vertical at an effective rate of radians per day. A simple method employing parallel transport within cones tangent to the Earth&#x27;s surface can be used to describe the rotation angle of the swing plane of Foucault&#x27;s pendulum.

From the perspective of an Earth-bound coordinate system (the measuring circle and spectator are Earth-bounded, also if terrain reaction to Coriolis force is not perceived by spectator when he moves), using a rectangular coordinate system with its axis pointing east and its axis pointing north, the precession of the pendulum is due to the Coriolis force (other fictitious forces as gravity and centrifugal force have not direct precession component, Euler&#x27;s force is low because Earth&#x27;s rotation speed is nearly constant). Consider a planar pendulum with constant natural frequency in the small angle approximation. There are two forces acting on the pendulum bob: the restoring force provided by gravity and the wire, and the Coriolis force (the centrifugal force, opposed to the gravitational restoring force, can be neglected). The Coriolis force at latitude is horizontal in the small angle approximation and is given by
formula_10
where is the rotational frequency of Earth, is the component of the Coriolis force in the direction, and is the component of the Coriolis force in the direction.

The restoring force, in the small-angle approximation and neglecting centrifugal force, is given by
formula_11
Using Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, this leads to the system of equations
formula_12

Switching to complex coordinates , the equations read
formula_13

To first order in , this equation has the solution
formula_14

If time is measured in days, then and the pendulum rotates by an angle of during one day.
=== Polarized light in an optical fiber ===
A second example is linearly polarized light entering a single-mode optical fiber. Suppose the fiber traces out some path in space, and the light exits the fiber in the same direction as it entered. Then compare the initial and final polarizations. In semiclassical approximation the fiber functions as a waveguide, and the momentum of the light is at all times tangent to the fiber. The polarization can be thought of as an orientation perpendicular to the momentum. As the fiber traces out its path, the momentum vector of the light traces out a path on the sphere in momentum space. The path is closed, since initial and final directions of the light coincide, and the polarization is a vector tangent to the sphere. Going to momentum space is equivalent to taking the Gauss map. There are no forces that could make the polarization turn, just the constraint to remain tangent to the sphere. Thus the polarization undergoes parallel transport, and the phase shift is given by the enclosed solid angle (times the spin, which in case of light is 1).

=== Stochastic pump effect ===

A stochastic pump is a classical stochastic system that responds with nonzero, on average, currents to periodic changes of parameters.
The stochastic pump effect can be interpreted in terms of a geometric phase in evolution of the moment generating function of stochastic currents. 

=== Spin ===

The geometric phase can be evaluated exactly for a spin- particle in a magnetic field.

=== Geometric phase defined on attractors ===

While Berry&#x27;s formulation was originally defined for linear Hamiltonian systems, it was soon realized by Ning and Haken that similar geometric phase can be defined for entirely different systems such as nonlinear dissipative systems that possess certain cyclic attractors. They showed that such cyclic attractors exist in a class of nonlinear dissipative systems with certain symmetries. There are several important aspects of this generalization of Berry&#x27;s phase: 1) Instead of the parameter space for the original Berry phase, this Ning-Haken generalization is defined in phase space; 2) Instead of the adiabatic evolution in quantum mechanical system, the evolution of the system in phase space needs not to be adiabatic. There is no restriction on the time scale of the temporal evolution; 3) Instead of a Hermitian system or non-hermitian system with linear damping, systems can be generally nonlinear and non-hermitian.

=== Exposure in molecular adiabatic potential surface intersections ===

There are several ways to compute the geometric phase in molecules within the Born–Oppenheimer framework. One way is through the &quot;non-adiabatic coupling formula_15 matrix&quot; defined by
formula_16
where formula_17 is the adiabatic electronic wave function, depending on the nuclear parameters formula_18. The nonadiabatic coupling can be used to define a loop integral, analogous to a Wilson loop (1974) in field theory, developed independently for molecular framework by M. Baer (1975, 1980, 2000). Given a closed loop formula_19, parameterized by formula_20 where formula_21 is a parameter, and formula_22. The &quot;D&quot;-matrix is given by
formula_23
(here formula_24 is a path-ordering symbol). It can be shown that once formula_25 is large enough (i.e. a sufficient number of electronic states is considered), this matrix is diagonal, with the diagonal elements equal to formula_26 where formula_27 are the geometric phases associated with the loop for the formula_28-th adiabatic electronic state.

For time-reversal symmetrical electronic Hamiltonians the geometric phase reflects the number of conical intersections encircled by the loop. More accurately,
formula_29
where formula_30 is the number of conical intersections involving the adiabatic state formula_31 encircled by the loop formula_32

An alternative to the &quot;D&quot;-matrix approach would be a direct calculation of the Pancharatnam phase. This is especially useful if one is interested only in the geometric phases of a single adiabatic state. In this approach, one takes a number formula_33 of points formula_34 along the loop formula_35 with formula_36 and formula_37 then using only the &quot;j&quot;-th adiabatic states formula_38 computes the Pancharatnam product of overlaps:
formula_39

In the limit formula_40 one has (see Ryb &amp; Baer 2004 for explanation and some applications)
formula_41

=== Geometric phase and quantization of cyclotron motion ===

An electron subjected to magnetic field formula_42 moves on a circular (cyclotron) orbit. Classically, any cyclotron radius formula_43 is acceptable. Quantum-mechanically, only discrete energy levels (Landau levels) are allowed, and since formula_43 is related to electron&#x27;s energy, this corresponds to quantized values of formula_43. The energy quantization condition obtained by solving Schrödinger&#x27;s equation reads, for example, formula_46 formula_47 for free electrons (in vacuum) or formula_48 for electrons in graphene, where formula_49. Although the derivation of these results is not difficult, there is an alternative way of deriving them, which offers in some respect better physical insight into the Landau level quantization. This alternative way is based on the semiclassical Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization condition
formula_50
which includes the geometric phase formula_51 picked up by the electron while it executes its (real-space) motion along the closed loop of the cyclotron orbit. For free electrons, formula_52 while formula_53 for electrons in graphene. It turns out that the geometric phase is directly linked to formula_47 of free electrons and formula_55 of electrons in graphene.

<text>The Edict of Fontainebleau (18 October 1685, published 22 October 1685) was an edict issued by French King Louis XIV and is also known as the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The Edict of Nantes (1598) had granted Huguenots the right to practice their religion without state persecution. Protestants had lost their independence in places of refuge under Cardinal Richelieu on account of their supposed insubordination, but they continued to live in comparative security and political contentment. From the outset, religious tolerance in France had been a royal, rather than popular, policy.

The lack of universal adherence to his religion did not sit well with Louis XIV&#x27;s vision of perfected autocracy.

==Edict of Nantes==

The Edict of Nantes had been issued on 13 April 1598 by Henry IV of France and granted the Calvinist Protestants of France, also known as Huguenots, substantial rights in the predominantly-Catholic state. Henry aimed at promoting civil unity by the edict. The edict treated some Protestants with tolerance and opened a path for secularism. It offered general freedom of conscience to individuals and many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the rights to work in any field, including for the state, and to bring grievances directly to the king. It marked the end of the French Wars of Religion, which had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.

== Revocation ==

In his edict given at his Palace of Fontainebleau in October 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes and ordered the destruction of Huguenot churches as well as the closing of Protestant schools. The edict made official the policy of persecution that was already enforced since the &quot;dragonnades&quot; that he had created in 1681 to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism. As a result of the officially-sanctioned persecution by the &quot;dragoons&quot;, who were billeted upon prominent Huguenots, many Protestants, estimates ranging from 210,000 to 900,000, left France over the next two decades. They sought asylum in the United Provinces, Sweden, Switzerland, Brandenburg-Prussia, Denmark, Scotland, England, Protestant states of the Holy Roman Empire, the Cape Colony in Africa and North America. On 17 January 1686, Louis XIV claimed that out of a Huguenot population of 800,000 to 900,000, only 1,000 to 1,500 had remained in France. 

It has long been said that a strong advocate for persecution of the Protestants was Louis XIV&#x27;s pious second wife, Madame de Maintenon, who was thought to have urged Louis to revoke Henry IV&#x27;s edict. There is no formal proof of that, and such views have now been challenged. Madame de Maintenon was by birth a Catholic but was also the granddaughter of Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné, an unrelenting Calvinist. Protestants tried to turn Madame de Maintenon and any time she took the defence of Protestants, she was suspected of relapsing into her family faith. Thus, her position was thin, which wrongly led people to believe that she advocated persecutions.

The revocation of the Edict of Nantes brought France into line with virtually every other European country of the period (with the exception of the Principality of Transylvania and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), which legally tolerated only the majority state religion. The French experiment of religious tolerance in Europe was effectively ended for the time being.

== Effects ==
 The Edict of Fontainebleau is compared by many historians with the 1492 Alhambra Decree ordering the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain and the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609 to 1614. All three are similar both as outbursts of religious intolerance ending periods of relative tolerance and in their social and economic effects. In practice, the revocation caused France to suffer a kind of early brain drain, as it lost many skilled craftsmen, including key designers such as Daniel Marot. Upon leaving France, Huguenots took with them knowledge of important techniques and styles, which had a significant effect on the quality of the silk, plate glass, silversmithing, watchmaking and cabinet making industries of those regions to which they relocated. Some rulers, such as Frederick Wilhelm, Duke of Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg, who issued the Edict of Potsdam in late October 1685, encouraged the Protestants to seek refuge in their nations. Similarly, in 1720 Frederick IV of Denmark invited the French Huguenots to seek refuge in Denmark, which they accepted, settling in Fredericia and other locations.

==Abolition==
In practice, the stringency of policies outlawing Protestants was opposed by the Jansenists and was relaxed during the reign of Louis XV, especially among discreet members of the upper classes. &quot;The fact that a hundred years later, when Protestants were again tolerated, many of them were found to be both commercially prosperous and politically loyal indicates that they fared far better than the Catholic Irish&quot;, R.R. Palmer concluded.

By the late 18th century, numerous prominent French philosophers and literary men of the day, including Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, were arguing strongly for religious tolerance. Efforts by Guillaume-Chrétien de Malesherbes, minister to Louis XVI, and Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne, a spokesman for the Protestant community, together with members of a provincial appellate court or &quot;parlement&quot; of the Ancien Régime, were particularly effective in persuading the king to open French society despite concerns expressed by some of his advisors. Thus, on 7 November 1787, Louis XVI signed the Edict of Versailles, known as the edict of tolerance registered in the &quot;parlement&quot; months later, on 29 January 1788. The edict offered relief to the main alternative faiths of Calvinist Huguenots, Lutherans and Jews by giving their followers civil and legal recognition as well as the right to form congregations openly after 102 years of prohibition.

Full religious freedom had to wait two more years, with enactment of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1787 edict was nonetheless a pivotal step in eliminating religious strife, and it officially ended religious persecution in France. Moreover, when French revolutionary armies invaded other European countries between 1789 and 1815, they followed a consistent policy of emancipating persecuted or circumscribed religious communities (Roman Catholic in some countries, Protestant in others and Jewish in most).

==Apology==
In October 1985, in the tricentenary of the Edict of Fontainebleau, French President François Mitterrand issued a public apology to the descendants of Huguenots around the world.

<text>&quot;[[Epigram]]s on Programming&quot; is an article by Alan Perlis published in 1982, for ACM&#x27;s SIGPLAN journal. The epigrams are a series of short, programming-language-neutral, humorous statements about computers and programming, which are widely quoted.

It first appeared in &quot;SIGPLAN Notices&quot; 17(9), September 1982.

In epigram #54, Perlis coined the term &quot;Turing tarpit&quot;, which he defined as a programming language where &quot;everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.&quot;

<doc id="323142" wikidata="Q6820949" url="?curid=323142" title="Mervyn's">
<text>Mervyn&#x27;s was an American middle-scale department store chain based in Hayward, California, and founded by Mervin G. Morris (1920–2021). It carried national brands of clothing, footwear, bedding, bath products, furniture, jewelry, beauty products, electronics, toys, and housewares. Many of the company&#x27;s stores were opened in shopping malls; however, some locations were operated independently. Based on 2005 revenue, Mervyn&#x27;s was the 83rd largest retailer in the United States.

In 2006, Mervyn&#x27;s had 189 stores in 10 states. One year later, after Mervyn&#x27;s closed its stores in Oregon and Washington, Mervyn&#x27;s had reduced its store count to 177 stores in seven states. On October 17, 2008, the company announced that it would liquidate its assets through a Chapter 7 filing, planning to close every remaining location by the end of the year. The Morris family bought back the intellectual property rights to the company in 2009 and announced plans to relaunch Mervyn&#x27;s as an internet-based enterprise. As of 2024, Meryvn&#x27;s Department Store has returned as an online only store that specializes in selling closeout and overstock merchandise from other retailers.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
Mervin G. Morris founded the first Mervyn&#x27;s store in San Lorenzo, California, on July 29, 1949. The store was supposed to be named &quot;Mervin&#x27;s&quot;, but a designer suggested that a spelling with a &quot;y&quot; instead of an &quot;i&quot; would be more visually appealing. Mervyn&#x27;s was located in the midst of San Lorenzo Village, a planned residential community between the cities of Hayward and San Leandro, composed of two- and three-bedroom tract homes built between 1944 and the 1950s. Mervyn&#x27;s carved a niche for itself by having a relatively no-frills shopping environment that reduced overhead, enabling the store to price merchandise lower than competing department stores. Mervyn&#x27;s also offered significantly-discounted factory seconds of basics such as jeans, T-shirts, underwear, and similar garments, as well as household linens, with flaws minor and undetectable by most. During the 1950s and 1960s, this made Mervyn&#x27;s popular with the young suburban families comprising the majority of San Lorenzo&#x27;s population. This marketing strategy was later abandoned before Mervyn&#x27;s expanded beyond its original single location, but Mervyn&#x27;s remained popular as a lower-priced alternative to national department store chains.

The second Mervyn&#x27;s store opened about south as an anchor tenant of the Fremont Hub Shopping Center, one of two regional malls in Fremont, California, in 1962.

===Target years and expansion===
In mid-1975, Mervyn&#x27;s operated stores in major cities and towns throughout California., and by October, it had expanded to southern California, opening stores in Fullerton and Huntington Beach. The location in Millbrae was particularly popular among San Francisco Peninsula customers searching for deals on off-season discount items.

By 1978, the company had grown to a chain of more than 50 stores in three states, and Mervyn&#x27;s was acquired by the Dayton-Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation). Mervyn&#x27;s kept its separate identity as a Dayton Hudson subsidiary. The average store had 80–130 employees. There was a Store Team Leader (1), Executive Team Leaders (2–4), Department Leaders (7–10), benefited team members (full-time employees not part of the leadership team), and part-time employees. All employees had &quot;credit goals&quot;, which referred to the number of customers that opened a Mervyn&#x27;s credit account. Part-time employees were expected one per every eight hours, and the leadership team was expected one per every 40 hours.

Mervyn&#x27;s entered Florida in 1988 with a store at Lakeland Square Mall in Lakeland, and began major expansions outside of California with Atlanta being the site of a particularly strong expansion campaign, followed by Miami in 1991 with the conversion of five Lord &amp; Taylor locations--Cutler Ridge Mall (1982), Coral Square (1984), Miami International Mall, Boynton Beach Mall (both 1985), and Treasure Coast Square (1987). Mervyn&#x27;s had not previously had a retail presence in the southern U.S., taking over a handful of Jordan Marsh sites in 1992 (along with a newly built store at Pembroke Lakes Mall). They also competed for mall space with JCPenney, which later received top anchor spots at the Town Center Mall in Kennesaw, Shannon Mall in Union City (rebuilt as a DHL Distribution Center), and Gwinnett Place Mall in Duluth (now Beauty Master). Stores that were unaffected were those at North Dekalb Mall in Decatur that was taken over by Upton&#x27;s (Burlington Coat Factory now occupies the store) and North Point Mall in Alpharetta, which became Parisian and was rebuilt as AMC Theatres. This was also likewise done at the same time in Florida where the company sold ten stores to Dillard&#x27;s, including the 5 aforementioned L&amp;T stores, along with former JM boxes at Pompano Fashion Square, Broward Mall, and Melbourne Square in Melbourne, and 2 others (Lakeland Square and Pembroke Lakes), the latter three locations became &quot;double headers&quot; for Dillard&#x27;s. The eight other Florida stores weren&#x27;t included in the deal and were sold to other retailers. Mervyn&#x27;s had withdrawn from both Miami and Atlanta in 1997. During the 1990s, Mervyn&#x27;s also expanded into Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, Minnesota, and Washington State.

===Mervyn&#x27;s California; sale from Target===
From 1995 to 2001, the stores were rebranded as Mervyn&#x27;s California, in an effort to identify with its West Coast roots. A media campaign was launched to publicize the rebranding, with TV commercials and catalogs featuring former San Francisco 49ers&#x27; quarterback Joe Montana. The rebranding had little effect on the company&#x27;s revenues, and the &quot;California&quot; was dropped from the name in 2001, reverting to the original name. The majority of their stores in Texas didn&#x27;t even consider adding the &quot;California&quot; name to their stores.

In March 2004, Target Corporation announced that they planned to put the Mervyn&#x27;s and Marshall Field&#x27;s divisions up for sale to focus on Target stores. Target Corporation was approached by many buyers for both stores but many of the potential buyers saw value only in the real estate. Target refused to sell to the groups that wanted to purchase Mervyn&#x27;s for the property value only. Target would only consider deals that would not close the company and put the then 30,000 employees out of work. 

The Mervyn&#x27;s locations in Minnesota were closed in 2004 as part of the deal between Target Corporation selling their Marshall Field&#x27;s division to The May Department Stores Company in June 2004. May purchased 9 Twin Cities area Mervyn&#x27;s locations along with the Marshall Field&#x27;s stores, and immediately announced closure of those Mervyn&#x27;s stores. Analysts saw this as a move by the May Company to block competition from acquiring those locations.
In July 2004, Target Corporation announced that Mervyn&#x27;s had been sold to a group of investors that included private investment firm and turnaround specialist Sun Capital Partners, Cerberus Capital Management, and real estate investment company Lubert-Adler Management Inc. Rick Leto was named the new president and chief merchandising officer in January 2005.

===Store closures prior to bankruptcy===

Sixty-two store closures were announced by the new owners in September 2005, stating the 62 stores closed only accounted for 17% of the chain&#x27;s sales. The closures comprised 28 of the 40 stores in Texas, 15 stores in Michigan, 10 stores in Colorado, three stores in Oklahoma, 3 stores in Louisiana; and one store closing in each state of Utah, Oregon, and California. Mervyn&#x27;s had an enviable real estate portfolio, and it was believed they could further invest in those properties, and make themselves more competitive.

In 2007, an additional 18 stores were closed. Of the stores closed, 17 were in Oregon and Washington, and one in Grand Junction, Colorado, which was the last remaining Mervyn&#x27;s store in that state.

===Bankruptcy and store closures===

Signs of financial distress and possible bankruptcy surfaced on July 21, 2008, when the Associated Press reported that Mervyn&#x27;s had stopped updating its financial status and that the department store&#x27;s vendors ceased shipping some products, hurting the store&#x27;s back-to-school season sales efforts. In addition, financing requests were denied by lenders. This raised the possibility of the company having to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, or going out of business altogether.

The company made no official comments at the time, but on July 29, 2008, Mervyn&#x27;s announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. Soon, the Chapter 11 case was converted to Chapter 7 liquidation on October 17, 2008. At the time of this announcement 3 stores had just held grand openings only a few months prior to being told they would soon close.

Although the company initially vowed to keep all locations open during the reorganization efforts, the company announced in August 2008 the closure of all 26 underperforming stores. The company hired an outside company to assist in the liquidation of assets from the stores affected. The closures also marked a complete retreat by Mervyn&#x27;s from the Idaho market, whose sole store in Boise was one of the ones marked for closure. In Texas, a complete retreat was slated from San Antonio, where all three remaining stores were marked for closure, in addition to the closure of the sole stores in Lubbock, Midland, and Odessa.

After these closures, Mervyn&#x27;s was left with about 150 stores: 16 in Arizona, 121 in California, three each in Nevada and New Mexico, seven in Texas and six in Utah.

In September 2008, Mervyn&#x27;s sued the financial institutions involved in the leveraged buyout of the chain, alleging that the deal had stripped the retailer of its real estate assets, forcing it into bankruptcy.
Mervyn&#x27;s said in the suit that Cerberus Capital Management and its partners had used the increased rent to finance the buyout.

===Liquidation===
Although the company attempted to undergo reorganization under bankruptcy, Mervyn&#x27;s ultimately succumbed to the ongoing Great Recession and announced that it would liquidate its assets through Chapter 7 of Title 11 in the United States Code, stating it &quot;is the best course of action to maximize value for all of the company&#x27;s creditors, employees and other stakeholders.&quot; The bankruptcy called for the company to liquidate and close its remaining stores. The announcement came amidst an offer by fashion retailer Forever 21 to purchase 149 of the remaining Mervyn&#x27;s stores for an undisclosed amount. The original negotiations failed, and Mervyn&#x27;s liquidated all 149 stores under the bankruptcy action. Several months later, department store retailer Kohl&#x27;s and Forever 21 prevailed in a joint bid at bankruptcy auction to take over the leases of 46 Mervyn&#x27;s stores; Kohl&#x27;s has assumed 31 stores, while Forever 21 has assumed 15 stores.

In a KPIX-TV interview on February 11, 2009, Mervin Morris&#x27;s son Jeff revealed that the family had bought the Mervyn&#x27;s name and intellectual property, including the company&#x27;s customer list as part of an effort to relaunch the company. Morris did not say when the website would launch or how much it would cost, only that decisions would be up to his sons. In 2009, the Mervyn&#x27;s website was replaced with a single-page site allowing visitors to sign-up for a mailing list to receive updates about the future of Mervyn&#x27;s. However, that page is no longer accessible, and the website no longer exists.

=== Online Only Store ===
As of 2024, Meryvnsonline has appeared as a website specializing in selling closeout and overstock merchandise from other retailers.

==Legacy==
A private road into a shopping center parking lot where a former Mervyn&#x27;s location used to be is still named Mervyn&#x27;s Drive in Fullerton, as a Mervyn&#x27;s location was there prior to 2008. Caltrans continues to maintain the traffic signal which connects the private road to Imperial Highway, and installed a new overhead sign with the name &quot;Mervyn&#x27;s Dr&quot; in 2019 after the old one fell off. The former store is now a Floor &amp; Decor.

A private road into a shopping center parking lot in Bakersfield is still named Mervyn&#x27;s Place continuing the department store&#x27;s legacy.

A minor road leading to a former location in San Jose is named Mervyn&#x27;s Way.

<text>Millbank Tower is a skyscraper in the City of Westminster at Millbank, by the River Thames in London, England. The tower was constructed in 1963, and has been home to many high-profile political organisations, including the Labour and Conservative parties, and the United Nations.

==History==
The tower was constructed in 1963 for Vickers and was therefore originally known as Vickers House or the Vickers Tower. It was designed by Ronald Ward and Partners and built by John Mowlem &amp; Co. It is a landmark on the London skyline, standing beside the River Thames, half a mile upstream from the Palace of Westminster. The tower has been owned by David and Simon Reuben since 2002, while still being managed by its former owner Tishman Speyer Properties. It is a Grade II listed building. Until the BT Tower&#x27;s completion in 1964, Millbank Tower was the tallest building in the United Kingdom. The 2003 edition of the Pevsner architectural guide says that the Millbank Tower is &quot;one of the few London office towers to have won affection&quot;, and contrasts it with the &quot;boxy structure&quot; of the Shell Tower at Waterloo.

In 2010, the building was surrounded and occupied by thousands of student protesters who spontaneously branched off from a demonstration called by the National Union of Students, which was campaigning against the Coalition government&#x27;s increase of tuition fees; Millbank was the location of Conservative Campaign Headquarters at the time. The demonstration and occupation helped spawn further student protests that year.

==Occupants==
The Millbank Tower has been home to many high-profile political and other organisations. From 1994 to 2002 the Labour Party rented two floors in the base at the south of the site, for use as a general election campaign centre. Labour ran its 1997 General Election campaign from these offices; after the election, the party vacated its headquarters at John Smith House, Walworth Road SE17, to move to Millbank. Five years later, the £1 million per annum rent forced the party to vacate the tower and take out a mortgage of £5.5 million to relocate to 16–18 Old Queen Street, overlooking St James&#x27;s Park, which had 11,200 square feet of open plan premises.

The United Nations also had offices in the tower, but moved out in June 2003, also citing high rents. Other public bodies have continued to occupy the building, including the Central Statistical Office, the predecessor of the Office for National Statistics; the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman; the Local Government Ombudsman; the UK India Business Council; and the Ministry of Justice Records Management Service.

Between 2006 and 2014, the Conservative Party based its campaign headquarters at 30 Millbank, in the same complex as Millbank Tower.

Other floors in the tower are or have been occupied by organisations and commercial companies, including the Environment Agency, the World Bank (which moved out in early 2022), Altitude 360 London, foreign exchange specialists World First, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, the UK India Business Council, the London office of Medopad, Canonical Ltd, the Audit Commission, event caterers Salt and Pepper, Private Food Design, the firm Lewis PR, the London office of the Open Society Foundations, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, XLN Telecom and Leave.EU.

The building also housed the studios for RT UK prior to its closure in 2022.

From April 2018, the office of the now-defunct People&#x27;s Vote campaign was based in the tower.

==Future==
In April 2016, the Reuben brothers were granted permission by Westminster City Council to redevelop the building, notwithstanding its Grade II Listed status. The resulting development will comprise 207 high-end apartments, a 5-star hotel with 150 rooms, a gym, spa and swimming pool, and a new cultural centre. The redevelopment, which includes a plan for an additional three storeys on the main tower is set to break ground in 2024 once the existing tenancies cease.

<doc id="323149" wikidata="Q2481494" url="?curid=323149" title="Matter of Rome">
<text>According to the medieval poet Jean Bodel, the Matter of Rome (; ) is the literary cycle of Greek and Roman mythology, together with episodes from the history of classical antiquity, focusing on military heroes like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. Bodel&#x27;s division of literary cycles also included the Matter of France and the Matter of Britain (although &quot;non-cyclical&quot; romance also existed). The Matter of Rome includes the Matter of Troy, consisting of romances and other texts based on the Trojan War and its legacy, including the adventures of Aeneas.

==Subject matter==
Classical topics were the subjects of a good deal of Old French literature, which in the case of Trojan subject matter ultimately deriving from Homer was built on scant sources; since the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; were unknown, medieval Western poets had to make do with two short prose narratives based on Homer, ascribed to Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius. The paucity of original text did not prevent the 12th century Norman poet Benoît de Sainte-Maure from writing a lengthy adaptation, &quot;Le Roman de Troie&quot;, running 40,000 lines. The poems that were written on these topics were called the &quot;romans d&#x27;antiquité&quot;, the &quot;romances of antiquity.&quot; This name presages the anachronistic approach the medieval poets used in dealing with these subjects. For example, in the epic poems &quot;Roman d&#x27;Alixandre&quot; and the &quot;Roman de Troie&quot;, Alexander the Great, and Achilles and his fellow heroes of the Trojan War were treated as knights of chivalry, not much different from the heroes of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;. Elements of courtly love were introduced into the poems; in the &quot;Roman de Thèbes&quot;, a romantic relationship absent from the Greek sources is introduced into the tale of Parthenopæus and Antigone. Military episodes in these tales were also multiplied, and used to introduce scenes of knight-errantry and tournaments. 

Another example of French medieval poetry in this genre is the &quot;Eneas&quot;, a treatment of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; that comes across as being a sort of burlesque of Virgil&#x27;s poem. Sentimental and fantasy elements in the source material were multiplied, and incidents from Ovid, the most popular Latin poet of the Middle Ages, were mixed into the pastiche. The &quot;Philomela&quot; attributed to Chrétien de Troyes, a retelling of the story of Philomela and Procne, also takes its source from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; is an English example, with Chaucer adding many elements to emphasize its connection with the matter. He also brought the story into line with the precepts of courtly love.

This anachronistic treatment of elements from Greek mythology is similar to that of the Middle English narrative poem &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot;, where the Greek Orpheus becomes the knight Sir Orfeo who rescues his wife Heurodis (i.e. Eurydice) from the fairy king.

==Principal texts==
Principal texts of the Matter of Rome include:
*&quot;Alexander Romance&quot;, probably written in Greek during the fourth century, adapted into European vernaculars in the twelfth century
*&quot;Seven Wise Masters&quot;, a collection of stories of Middle Eastern and Indian origin
*&quot;Romance of Thebes&quot;, a 1155 French retelling of the ancient Greek myth of Eteocles and Polynices, based on the first-century Latin poem &quot;Thebaid&quot; by Statius
*&quot;Roman d&#x27;Enéas,&quot; written in French in 1156, based on the myth of Aeneas as recounted by Virgil in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;
*&quot;Roman de Troie&quot;, a French poem written in the 1150s by Benoît de Sainte-Maure
*&quot;Roman d&#x27;Éracle&quot;, written by the French writer Gautier d&#x27;Arras in 1177

<text>William Lewis Cabell (January 1, 1827 – February 21, 1911) was an American engineer, lawyer, businessman, and politician who served as the 14th, 16th and 20th mayor of Dallas (1874–1876, 1877–1879 and 1883–1885). Prior to that, he was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War.

== Early life and education ==
William Lewis Cabell was born in Danville, Virginia. Cabell had seven brothers. Six of them held prominent positions in the Confederate States Army. Another brother died just prior to the American Civil War from an arrow wound received in Florida. Cabell graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1850 and joined the United States Army as a second lieutenant with the 7th U.S. Infantry. In June 1855, he was promoted to first lieutenant and appointed as regimental quartermaster on the staff of General Persifor F. Smith.

== American Civil War ==
At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Cabell returned to Little Rock, Arkansas, and offered his services to Arkansas Governor Rector. In April 1861, he received a telegram from the Confederate States government and went to Richmond, Virginia, to assist in the establishment of the commissary, quartermaster, and ordnance departments for the Confederate military. He was sent to Manassas, Virginia, to take the position of Quartermaster for the Confederate Army of the Potomac under General P.G.T. Beauregard. He served on Beauregard&#x27;s staff and then on the staff of General Joseph E. Johnston until reassigned in January 1862.

After leaving Virginia, Cabell was assigned by General Albert Sidney Johnston to serve under Major-General Earl Van Dorn, who was commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department. Cabell was promoted to brigadier-general and placed in command of all Confederate troops on the White River, with his headquarters at Jacksonport, Arkansas. Soon after the Battle of Pea Ridge, Confederate forces were withdrawn from Arkansas and moved across the Mississippi River. Upon his arrival at Corinth, Mississippi, Cabell was given command of a Texas brigade with an Arkansas regiment attached. Cabell led this brigade in several engagements around Corinth. Cabell was transferred to an Arkansas brigade, which he led in the Battle of Iuka and the Battle of Corinth. He was wounded leading a charge against the Union entrenchments at Corinth and again at the Battle of Hatchie&#x27;s Bridge, which left him temporarily disabled and unfit for field command.

In February 1863, he was placed in command of northwestern Arkansas and successfully recruited and outfitted one of the largest cavalry brigades west of the Mississippi. Cabell led this brigade in over 20 engagements in the Trans-Mississippi Department including prominent roles at the Battle of Poison Spring and the Battle of Marks&#x27; Mills where he commanded two brigades under Brigadier-General James Fleming Fagan. He commanded Confederate forces in the Battle of Fayetteville, on April 18, 1863. Cabell was captured in Kansas (by Sergeant Calvary M. Young of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry) during Price&#x27;s Missouri Expedition on October 25, 1864, at the Battle of Mine Creek and was held as a prisoner of war at the Johnson&#x27;s Island camp on Lake Erie and then at Fort Warren in Boston.

== Later years ==
After the war, Cabell returned to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where he worked as a civil engineer and studied law at night. He was admitted to the Arkansas bar in 1868 and practiced law for a few years. In 1872, Cabell and his family moved to Dallas, Texas. In 1874, he was elected mayor of that city and served three two-year terms: in 1874–1876, in 1877–1879, and finally in 1883–1885. During his tenure, he expanded rail access to the city, established sewer and electrical services, started a program of paving streets, and presided over a period of rapid growth. After leaving office, Cabell became Vice President of the Texas Trunk Railroad Company. In 1885, he was appointed as U.S. Marshal and served in that capacity until 1889. During the Spanish–American War, at age 71, he offered his military services to the U.S. Government.

Cabell also remained active in Confederate veteran affairs. He oversaw several large veteran reunions and assisted in establishing pensions, veteran homes, and Confederate cemeteries in Texas. He served as commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department of the United Confederate Veterans. William Lewis Cabell died in Dallas on February 22, 1911. 50,000 people lined the streets for a military parade and 25,000 witnessed the ceremony of his burial at Greenwood Cemetery. Before his death, Cabell had converted to Catholicism.

== Personal life ==
Cabell married the daughter of Major Elias Rector of Arkansas; she served as a nurse during the Civil War. Daughter Katie Doswell Cabell, who married a Mr. Currie, followed by Mr. Muse, became president after the war of the Texas Division, United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) (25 May 1896 – 17 Dec 1897 &amp; 17 Oct 1921 – 19 Oct 1922) and President General, UDC (serving Nov 1897 – Nov 1899). Grandson Charles P. Cabell had a career in the United States Air Force, gaining rank as a four-star general. He was appointed as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence during the 1950s. Another grandson, Earle Cabell, became a politician and was also elected as mayor of Dallas. He was serving in November 1963 when United States President John F. Kennedy was assassinated there.

<text>Public works are a broad category of infrastructure projects, financed and procured by a government body for recreational, employment, and health and safety uses in the greater community. They include public buildings (municipal buildings, schools, and hospitals), transport infrastructure (roads, railroads, bridges, pipelines, canals, ports, and airports), public spaces (public squares, parks, and beaches), public services (water supply and treatment, sewage treatment, electrical grid, and dams), environmental protection (drinking water protection, soil erosion reduction,
wildlife habitat preservation, 
preservation and restoration of forests and wetlands) and other, usually long-term, physical assets and facilities. Though often interchangeable with public infrastructure and public capital, public works does not necessarily carry an economic component, thereby being a broader term. Construction may be undertaken either by directly employed labour or by a private operator.

Public works has been encouraged since antiquity. The Roman emperor Nero encouraged the construction of various infrastructure projects during widespread deflation.

==Overview ==
Public works is a multi-dimensional concept in economics and politics, touching on multiple arenas including: recreation (parks, beaches, trails), aesthetics (trees, green space), economy (goods and people movement, energy), law (police and courts), and neighborhood (community centers, social services buildings). It represents any constructed object that augments a nation&#x27;s physical infrastructure.

Municipal infrastructure, urban infrastructure, and rural development usually represent the same concept but imply either large cities or developing nations&#x27; concerns respectively. The terms public infrastructure or critical infrastructure are at times used interchangeably. However, critical infrastructure includes public works (dams, waste water systems, bridges, etc.) as well as facilities like hospitals, banks, and telecommunications systems and views them from a national security viewpoint and the impact on the community that the loss of such facilities would entail.

Furthermore, the term public works has recently been expanded to include digital public infrastructure projects. For example, in the United States, the first nationwide digital public works project is an effort to create an open source software platform for e-voting (created and managed by the Open Source Digital Voting Foundation).

Reflecting increased concern with sustainability, urban ecology and quality of life, efforts to move towards sustainable municipal infrastructure are common in developed nations, especially in the European Union and Canada (where the FCM InfraGuide provides an officially mandated best practice exchange to move municipalities in that direction).

== Public works programmes ==
A public employment programme or public works programme is the provision of employment by the creation of predominantly public goods at a prescribed wage for those unable to find alternative employment. This functions as a form of social safety net. Public works programmes are activities which entail the payment of a wage (in cash or in kind) by the state, or by an Agent (or cash-for work/CFW). One particular form of public works, that of offering a short-term period of employment, has come to dominate practice, particularly in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. Applied in the short term, this is appropriate as a response to transient shocks and acute labour market crises.

Investing in public works projects in order to stimulate the general economy has been a popular policy measure since the economic crisis of the 1930s. Spearheaded by U.S. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, the first female Cabinet member in the United States, the New Deal resulted in the creation of programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps, Public Works Administration, and the Works Progress Administration, among others, all of which created public goods through labor and infrastructure investments.

More recent examples are the 2008–2009 Chinese economic stimulus program, India&#x27;s National Infrastructure Pipeline of 2020, the 2008 European Union stimulus plan, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

== Utility of investment ==
While it is argued that capital investment in public works can be used to reduce unemployment, opponents of internal improvement programs argue that such projects should be undertaken by the private sector, not the public sector, because public works projects are often inefficient and costly to taxpayers. Further, some argue that public works, when used excessively by a government, are characteristic of socialism and other public or collectivist forms of government because of their &#x27;tax and spend&#x27; policies to achieve long-term economic improvement. However, in the private sector, entrepreneurs bear their own losses and so private-sector firms are generally unwilling to undertake projects that could result in losses or would not develop a revenue stream. Governments will invest in public works because of the overall benefit to society when there is a lack of private sector benefit (a project that does generate revenue) or the risk is too great for a private company to accept on its own.

According to research conducted at the Aalborg University, 86% of public works projects end up with cost overruns. Some findings of the research were the following:
* Technically difficult projects were not more likely to exceed the budget than less difficult projects.
* Projects in which more people were directly and indirectly affected by the project turned out to be more susceptible to cost overruns.
* Project managers generally did not learn from similar projects attempted in the past.

Generally, contracts awarded by public tenders include a provision for unexpected expenses (cost overruns), which typically amount to 10% of the value of the contract. This money is spent during the course of the project only if the construction managers judge that it is necessary, and the expenditure must typically be justified in writing.

<doc id="323164" wikidata="Q315734" url="?curid=323164" title="John Houseman">
<text>John Houseman (born Jacques Haussmann; September 22, 1902 – October 31, 1988) was a British-American actor and producer of theatre, film, and television. He became known for his highly publicized collaboration with director Orson Welles from their days in the Federal Theatre Project through to the production of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and his collaboration, as producer of &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot;, with writer Raymond Chandler on the screenplay. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Professor Charles W. Kingsfield in the 1973 film &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;. He reprised the role of Kingsfield in the 1978 television series adaptation.

==Early life==
Houseman was born Jacques Haussmann on September 22, 1902, in Bucharest, Romania, the son of May (née Davies) a governess and Georges Haussmann, who ran a grain business. His mother was British, from a Christian family of Welsh and Irish descent. His father was an Alsatian-born Jew. 

Haussmann was educated in England at Clifton College, became a British subject, and worked in the grain trade in London. He moved to Argentina as a speculator in the international grain markets before immigrating to the United States in 1925. He had a successful business career and was on the Chicago Board of Trade.

Having just married actress Zita Johann weeks before the 1929 stock market crash and with international markets in chaos, she encouraged him to reinvent himself with a new career path in the theater, where he took the stage name of John Houseman. He began by translating works in German and French into English for the New York stage.

He became a United States citizen in 1943.

== Theatre producer ==

On Broadway he co-wrote &quot;Three and One&quot; (1933) and &quot;And Be My Love&quot; (1934). Composer Virgil Thomson recruited him to direct &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot; (1934), Thomson&#x27;s collaboration with Gertrude Stein. He later directed &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot; (1934) and &quot;Valley Forge&quot; (1934).

=== Collaboration with Orson Welles ===
In 1934, Houseman was looking to cast &quot;Panic&quot;, a play he was producing based on a drama by Archibald MacLeish concerning a Wall Street financier whose world crumbles about him when consumed by the crash of 1929. Although the central figure is a man in his late fifties, Houseman became obsessed by the notion that a young man named Orson Welles he had seen in Katharine Cornell&#x27;s production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was the only person qualified to play the leading role. Welles consented and, after preliminary conversations, agreed to leave the play he was in after a single night to take the lead in Houseman&#x27;s production. &quot;Panic&quot; opened at the Imperial Theatre on March 15, 1935. Among the cast was Houseman&#x27;s ex-wife, Zita Johann, who had co-starred with Boris Karloff three years earlier in Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot;.

Although the play opened to indifferent notices and ran for a mere three performances, it nevertheless led to the forging of a theatrical team, a fruitful but stormy partnership in which Houseman said Welles &quot;was the teacher, I, the apprentice.&quot;

He supervised the direction of &quot;Walk Together Chillun&quot; in 1936.

=== Federal Theatre Project ===
In 1936, the Federal Theatre Project of the Works Progress Administration put unemployed theatre performers and employees to work. The Negro Theatre Unit of the Federal Theatre Project was headed by Rose McClendon, a well-known black actress, and Houseman, a theatre producer. Houseman describes the experience in one of his memoirs:
Within a year of its formation, the Federal Theatre had more than fifteen thousand men and women on its payroll at an average wage of approximately twenty dollars a week. During the four years of its existence its productions played to more than thirty million people in more than two hundred theatres as well as portable stages, school auditoriums and public parks the country over.

=== &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1936) ===
Houseman immediately hired Welles and assigned him to direct &quot;Macbeth&quot; for the FTP&#x27;s Negro Theater Unit, a production that became known as the &quot;Voodoo Macbeth&quot;, as it was set in the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe (and with voodoo witch doctors for the three Weird Sisters) and starred Jack Carter in the title role. The incidental music was composed by Virgil Thomson. The play premiered at the Lafayette Theatre on April 14, 1936, to enthusiastic reviews and remained sold out for each of its nightly performances. The play was regarded by critics and patrons as an enormous, if controversial, success. After 10 months with the Negro Theater Project, however, Houseman felt he was faced with the dilemma of risking his future:

... on a partnership with a 20-year-old boy in whose talent I had unquestioning faith but with whom I must increasingly play the combined and tricky roles of producer, censor, adviser, impresario, father, older brother and bosom friend.

Houseman later produced for the Negro Theatre Unit &quot;Turpentine&quot; (1936) without Welles.

In 1936, Houseman and Welles were running a WPA unit in midtown Manhattan for classic productions called Project No. 891. Their first production was Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tragical History of Dr. Faustus&quot; which Welles directed while also playing the title role.

Houseman and Welles put on &quot;Horse Eats Hat&quot; (1936). Houseman, without Welles, helped in the direction of Leslie Howard&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1936).

=== &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1937) ===
In June 1937, Project No. 891 produced their most controversial work with &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;. Written by Marc Blitzstein, the musical was about Larry Foreman, a worker in Steeltown (played in the original production by Howard da Silva), which is run by the boss, Mister Mister (played in the original production by Will Geer). The show was thought to have had left-wing and unionist sympathies (Foreman ends the show with a song about &quot;unions&quot; taking over the town and the country), and became legendary as an example of a &quot;censored&quot; show. Shortly before the show was to open, FTP officials in Washington announced that no productions would open until after July 1, 1937, the beginning of the new fiscal year.

In his memoir, &quot;Run-Through&quot;, Houseman wrote about the circumstances surrounding the opening night at the Maxine Elliott Theatre. All the performers had been enjoined not to perform on stage for the production when it opened on July 14, 1937. The cast and crew left their government-owned theatre and walked 20 blocks to another theatre, with the audience following. No one knew what to expect; when they got there Blitzstein himself was at the piano and started playing the introduction music. One of the amateur performers, Olive Stanton, who played the part of Moll, the prostitute, stood up in the audience, and began singing her part. All the other performers, in turn, stood up for their parts. Thus the &quot;oratorio&quot; version of the show was born. Apparently, Welles had designed some intricate scenery, which ended up never being used. The event was so successful that it was repeated several times on subsequent nights, with everyone trying to remember and reproduce what had happened spontaneously the first night. The incident, however, led to Houseman being fired and Welles&#x27;s resignation from Project No. 891.

=== Mercury Theatre ===
That same year, 1937, after detaching themselves from the Federal Theatre Project, Houseman and Welles did &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; as an independent production on Broadway. They also founded the acclaimed New York drama company, the Mercury Theatre. Houseman wrote of their collaboration at this time:

On the broad wings of the Federal eagle, we had risen to success and fame beyond ourselves as America&#x27;s youngest, cleverest, most creative and audacious producers to whom none of the ordinary rules of the theater applied.

Armed with a manifesto written by Houseman declaring their intention to foster new talent, experiment with new types of plays, and appeal to the same audiences that frequented the Federal Theater the company was designed largely to offer plays of the past, preferably those that &quot;...seem to have emotion or factual bearing on contemporary life.&quot; The company mounted several notable productions, the most remarkable being its first commercial production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. Houseman called the decision to use modern dress &quot;an essential element in Orson&#x27;s conception of the play as a political melodrama with clear contemporary parallels.&quot;

Houseman and Welles later presented &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1938), &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; (1938) and &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; (1938).

===Radio===
Beginning in the summer of 1938, the Mercury Theatre was featured in a weekly dramatic radio program on the CBS network, initially promoted as &quot;First Person Singular&quot; before gaining the official title &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;. An adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; was scheduled for the program&#x27;s first broadcast, for which Houseman worked feverishly on the script. However, a week before the show was to air, Welles decided that a program far more dramatic was required. To Houseman&#x27;s horror, &quot;Treasure Island&quot; was abandoned in favor of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, with Welles playing the infamous vampire. During an all night session at Perkins&#x27; Restaurant, Welles and Houseman hashed out a script.

&quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; featured an impressive array of talents, including Agnes Moorehead, Bernard Herrmann, and George Coulouris.

==== &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1938) ====
&quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; subsequently became famous for its notorious 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, which had put much of the country in a panic. By all accounts, Welles was shocked by the panic that ensued. According to Houseman, &quot;he hadn&#x27;t the faintest idea what the effect would be&quot;. CBS was inundated with calls; newspaper switchboards were jammed.

Without Welles, Houseman staged Douglas Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1939).

==Film producer==
=== &quot;Too Much Johnson&quot; (1938) ===
While Houseman was teaching at Vassar College, he produced Welles&#x27; never-completed second short film, &quot;Too Much Johnson&quot; (1938). The film was never publicly screened and no print of the film was thought to have survived. Footage was rediscovered in 2013.

===&quot; Citizen Kane&quot; (1941)===
The Welles-Houseman collaboration continued in Hollywood. In the spring of 1939, Welles began preliminary discussions with RKO&#x27;s head of production, George Schaefer, with Welles and his Mercury players being given a two-picture deal, in which Welles would produce, direct, perform, and have full creative control of his projects.

For his motion picture debut, Welles first considered adapting Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; for the screen. A 200-page script was written. Some models were constructed, while the shooting of initial test footage had begun. However, little, if anything, had been done either to whittle down the budgetary difficulties or begin filming. When RKO threatened to eliminate the payment of salaries by December 31 if no progress had been made, Welles announced that he would pay his cast out of his own pocket. Houseman proclaimed that there wasn&#x27;t enough money in their business account to pay anyone. During a corporate dinner for the Mercury crew, Welles exploded, calling his partner a &quot;bloodsucker&quot; and a &quot;crook&quot;. As Houseman attempted to leave, Welles began hurling dish heaters at him, effectively ending both their partnership and friendship.

Houseman later, however, played a pivotal role in ushering &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), which starred Welles. Welles telephoned Houseman asking him to return to Hollywood to &quot;babysit&quot; screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz while he completed the script, and keep him away from alcohol. Still drawn to Welles, as was virtually everyone in his sphere, Houseman agreed. Although Welles took credit for the screenplay of &quot;Kane&quot;, Houseman stated that the credit belonged to Mankiewicz, an assertion that led to a final break with Welles. Houseman took some credit himself for the general shaping of the story line and for editing the script. In an interview with Penelope Huston for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine (Autumn, 1962) Houseman said that the writing of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was a delicate subject:

In 1975, during an interview with Kate McCauley, Houseman stated that film critic Pauline Kael in her essay &quot;Raising Kane&quot;, had caused an &quot;idiotic controversy&quot; over the issue: &quot;The argument is Orson&#x27;s own fault. He wanted to be given all the credit because he&#x27;s a hog. Actually, it &quot;is&quot; his film. So it&#x27;s a ridiculous argument.&quot;

=== Return to the theatre ===
After he and Welles went their separate ways, Houseman went on to direct &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1939) and &quot;Liberty Jones&quot; (1941) and produced the Mercury Theatre&#x27;s stage production of &quot;Native Son&quot; (1941) on Broadway, directed by Welles.

===David O. Selznick===
In Hollywood he became a vice-president of David O. Selznick Productions. His most notable achievement during that time was helping adapt and produce the adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943) which starred Joan Fontaine and Welles.

===World War II===
In the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Houseman quit his job and became the head of the overseas radio division of the Office of War Information (OWI), working for the Voice of America whilst also managing its operations in New York City.

===Paramount===
In 1945 Houseman signed a contract with Paramount Pictures to produce movies. His first credit for that studio was &quot;The Unseen&quot; (1945). He followed it with &quot;Miss Susie Slagle&#x27;s&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; (1946), both with Veronica Lake. The latter, starring Alan Ladd and written by Raymond Chandler, has become a classic.

He left Paramount and returned to Broadway to direct &quot;Lute Song&quot; (1946) with Mary Martin.

Back in Hollywood he produced &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; (1948) for Max Ophuls at Universal.

===RKO===
Houseman went to RKO where he produced &quot;They Live by Night&quot; (1948) the directorial debut of Nicholas Ray. He also did &quot;The Company She Keeps&quot; (1949) and &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot; (1951).

He returned to Broadway to produce &quot;Joy to the World&quot; (1949) and &quot;King Lear&quot; (1950-51), the latter with Louis Calhern.

===MGM===
RKO&#x27;s head of production had been Dore Schary. When Schary moved to MGM he offered Houseman a contract at the studio, which the producer accepted.

Houseman&#x27;s stint at MGM began with &quot;Holiday for Sinners&quot; (1952); then he had a huge success with &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), directed by Vincente Minnelli. He followed it with the film adaptation of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953) (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture)

Also popular was &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954), a highly creative adaptation by Ernest Lehman of Cameron Hawley&#x27;s bestselling novel. However, although &quot;Her Twelve Men&quot; (1954), Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;The Cobweb&quot; (1955) and Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Moonfleet&quot; (1955) all lost money. So did &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956), a biopic directed by Minnelli of Vincent van Gogh, although it was extremely well-received critically.

===Television and theatre===
Houseman moved into television producing, notably doing &quot;The Seven Lively Arts&quot; (1957) and episodes of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

He also returned to theatre, producing revivals of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (1957).

===Return to MGM===
Houseman was enticed back to MGM as a producer, and given his own production company, John Houseman Productions. His films were &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1962), &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; (1962) and &quot;In the Cool of the Day&quot; (1963).

===Return to television===
Houseman returned to television where he made &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; and &quot;Journey to America&quot; (1964). He returned to Hollywood briefly to produce &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot; (1966), then returned to TV for &quot;Evening Primrose&quot; (1966).

He returned to Broadway, directing &quot;Pantagleize&quot; (1967).

==Teaching==
=== The Juilliard School and The Acting Company===
Houseman became the founding director of the Drama Division at The Juilliard School, and held this position from 1968 until 1976. The first graduating class in 1972 included Kevin Kline and Patti LuPone; subsequent classes under Houseman&#x27;s leadership included Christopher Reeve, Mandy Patinkin, Kevin Conroy and Robin Williams.

Unwilling to see that very first class disbanded upon graduation, Houseman and his Juilliard colleague Margot Harley formed them into an independent, touring repertory company they named the &quot;Group 1 Acting Company.&quot; The organization was subsequently renamed The Acting Company, and has been active for more than 40 years. Houseman served as the producing artistic director through 1986, and Harley has been the company&#x27;s producer since its founding. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1996, Mel Gussow called it &quot;the major touring classical theater in the United States.&quot;

===Theatre===
Houseman continued to be involved in theatre, producing &quot;The School for Wives&quot; (1971), &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; (1973), &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (1973), &quot;Scapin&quot; (1973), &quot;Next Time I&#x27;ll Sing to You&quot; (1974), &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot; (1975), &quot;Edward II&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; (1975)

He directed &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1972), &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; (1973), &quot;Measure for Measure &quot; (1973), and &quot;Clarence Darrow&quot; (1974) (with Henry Fonda).

In 1979, Houseman earned induction into the American Theater Hall of Fame

==Acting==

Houseman had acted occasionally during the early part of his career and he had a brief but important part in &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964).

Houseman first became widely known to the public for his Golden Globe and Academy Award-winning role as Professor Charles Kingsfield in the film &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; (1973). The film was a success and launched Houseman into an unexpected late career as a character actor.

Houseman played Energy Corporation Executive Bartholomew in the film &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), and was in the thrillers &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975) and &quot;St Ives&quot; (1976).

Houseman appeared on TV in &quot;Fear on Trial&quot; (1975), &quot;The Adams Chronicles&quot; (1976), &quot;Truman at Potsdam&quot; (1976), &quot;Hazard&#x27;s People&quot; (1976) and &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; (1976). Houseman was reunited with &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; co-star Lindsay Wagner in 1976&#x27;s &quot;Kill Oscar&quot;, a three-part joint episode of the popular science fiction series &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;; he played the scientific genius Dr. Franklin.

He continued appearing on TV in &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; (1976), &quot;The Displaced Person&quot; (1977), a version of &quot;Our Town&quot; (1977), &quot;&quot; (1977), &quot;The Best of Families&quot; (1977), &quot;Aspen&quot;, &quot;The Last Convertible&quot; (1978), &quot;The French Atlantic Affair&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Associates&quot; (1980).

In films he parodied Sydney Greenstreet in the Neil Simon film &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978) and was in &quot;Old Boyfriends&quot; (1980), John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980), &quot;Wholly Moses!&quot; (1981) and &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; (1981).

Houseman briefly returned to producing with the TV movie &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot; (1980), which he also appeared in and &quot;Choices of the Heart&quot; (1983). He produced one more show on Broadway, &quot;The Curse of an Aching Heart&quot; (1982).

He acted in &quot;The Babysitter&quot; (1980), &quot;A Christmas Without Snow&quot; (1980), &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1981), &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, &quot;Murder by Phone&quot; (1982) (second billed), &quot;Marco Polo&quot; (1982), and &quot;American Playhouse&quot; (1982).

===Television star===

Having played a Harvard Law School professor in the film &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; (1973), he reprised the role in a television series of the same name, which ran from 1978 to 1979 and 1983 to 1986. During that time, he received two Golden Globe nominations for &quot;Best Actor in a TV Series—Drama&quot;.

In the 1980s Houseman became more widely known for his role as grandfather Edward Stratton II in &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, which starred Rick Schroder, and for his commercials for brokerage firm Smith Barney, which featured the catchphrase, &quot;They make money the old fashioned way... they &quot;earn it&quot;.&quot; Another was Puritan brand cooking oil, with &quot;less saturated fat than the leading oil&quot;, featuring the famous &#x27;tomato test&#x27;.

He played Jewish author Aaron Jastrow (loosely based on the real life figure of Bernard Berenson) in the highly acclaimed 1983 miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (receiving a fourth Golden Globe nomination). He declined to reprise the role in the sequel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; miniseries (the role then went to Sir John Gielgud).

However he was in the miniseries &quot;A.D.&quot; (1984), &quot;Noble House&quot; (1986), and &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1988).

== Writing ==

Between and sometimes during engagements, he contributed articles and book reviews to national publications, and wrote three volumes of memoirs, which are a chronicle of an era as well as a testimony to his phenomenal powers of recall: &quot;Run Through&quot; (1972), &quot;Front and Center&quot; (1979) and &quot;Final Dress&quot; (1983). In 1986 he published &quot;Entertainers and the Entertained.&quot; A fourth volume, &quot;Unfinished Business: Memoirs, 1902 to 1988,&quot; a distillation of his earlier books with some new material, was published in 1988.

== Personal life ==
Houseman was married to Zita Johann from 1929 to 1933. She was a stage actress when they married and he was a successful grain dealer until the 1929 Stock Market crash, at which point he became destitute and she encouraged him to pursue a new career in the theater.

Houseman was in a relationship with actress Joan Fontaine after her marriage to actor Brian Aherne ended in 1945.

In 1952, Houseman married Joan Courtney, a British actress born in 1916. They had two sons together. Under the name &quot;Joan Houseman,&quot; she acted in TV and film in the 1950s and 1960s. The couple was married until his death in 1988.

== Final years and death ==
Later film appearances included &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (1988) and &quot;Another Woman&quot; (1988).

In 1988, he appeared in his last two roles—cameos in the films &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; and &quot;Scrooged&quot;. He played a driving instructor (whose mannerisms parodied many of his prior roles) in the former, and himself in the latter. Both films were released after his death.

On October 31, 1988, Houseman died at age 86 of spinal cancer at his home in Malibu, California.

<text>An airstrike, air strike, or air raid is an offensive operation carried out by aircraft. Air strikes are delivered from aircraft such as blimps, balloons, fighter aircraft, attack aircraft, bombers, attack helicopters, and drones. The official definition includes all sorts of targets, including enemy air targets, but in popular usage the term is usually narrowed to a tactical (small-scale) attack on a ground or naval objective as opposed to a larger, more general attack such as carpet bombing. Weapons used in an airstrike can range from direct-fire aircraft-mounted cannons and machine guns, rockets and air-to-surface missiles, to various types of aerial bombs, glide bombs, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and even directed-energy weapons such as laser weapons.

In close air support, air strikes are usually controlled by trained observers on the ground for coordination with ground troops and intelligence in a manner derived from artillery tactics.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The first large scale air raid occurred during World War I in 1915, when London was bombed by 15 German Zeppelin dirigibles at night. Since the residents of London, and many of its defenders, were asleep, a loud warning system for air raids made sense, leading to the creation of the air raid siren.

===World War II===

It was not until World War II that the Oxford English Dictionary first records usage of the term &quot;air strike&quot;, which remained two separate words for some time thereafter. The Second World War also saw the first development of precision-guided munitions, which were fielded successfully by the Germans, and contributed to the modern sense of air &quot;strike&quot;, a precision targeted attack as opposed to a strafing run or area bombing. 

The importance of precision targeting cannot be overstated: by some statistics, over a hundred raids were necessary to destroy a point target in World War 2; by the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. Air Force was able to release to media precise footage of television- or radar-guided bombs directly hitting the target without significant collateral damage (using, for example, the LANTIRN pod). Paul Fussell noted in his seminal work The Great War and Modern Memory the popular 20th century tendency to assume an errant bomb hitting a church, for example, was completely deliberate and reflective of the inherent evil of the enemy; over time, expectations for reduced collateral damage have increased to the point that developed countries engaging in war against less technologically advanced countries approach near-zero in terms of such damage.

===After World War II===

In the Malayan Emergency of the 1950s, British and Commonwealth Avro Lincoln heavy bombers, de Havilland Vampire fighter jets, Supermarine Spitfires, Bristol Brigands, de Havilland Mosquitos, and a host of other British aircraft were used in Malaya in operations against guerillas. However, the humid climate played havoc with the Mosquito&#x27;s wooden airframe, and they were soon deployed elsewhere. This period also marked the last combat deployment of British Spitfires.

During the Vietnam War, airstrikes and their doctrine were adjusted to fit the jets, like the North American F-100 Super Sabre, Republic F-105 Thunderchief, Douglas A-4 Skyhawk, and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which were entering the U.S.A.F. and U.S.N. inventory. These aircraft could fly faster, carry more ordnance, and defend themselves better than the F-4U Corsair and North American P-51 Mustang fighters that fought during the Korean War, albeit at the cost of the R&amp;D of the aircraft itself, the weapons, and, most important to the man on the ground, fuel and loiter time, though this situation was slightly alleviated with the introduction of aircraft like the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly, LTV A-7 Corsair II, and Lockheed AC-130 gunships.

Today, airstrike terminology has extended to the concept of the strike aircraft, what earlier generations of military aviators referred to as light bombers or attack aircraft. With the near-complete air supremacy enjoyed by developed nations in undeveloped regions, fighter jets can often be modified to add strike capability in a manner less practicable in earlier generations.

Airstrikes can be carried out for strategic purposes outside of general warfare. Operation Opera was a single eight-ship Israeli airstrike against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor, criticized by world opinion but not leading to a general outbreak of war. Such an example of the preventive strike has created new questions for international law.

Airstrikes, including airstrikes by drones, were extensively used during the Gulf War, War on Terror, War in Afghanistan, Iraq War, First Libyan Civil War, Syrian Civil War, Iraqi Civil War, Yemeni Civil War, 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

===Non-combatant deaths===
Airstrike campaigns often cause the deaths of non-combatants, including civilians. International law apply the principles of &quot;military necessity&quot;, &quot;distinction&quot;, and &quot;proportionality&quot;. These principles emphasize that an attack must be directed towards a legitimate military target and the harm caused to non-combatant targets must be proportional to the advantage gained by such attack. Many modern military aircraft carry precision-guided munitions, which military sources promote as decreasing civilian deaths.

<text>Jean Bodel (c. 1165 – c. 1210), also spelled Jehan Bodel, was an Old French poet who wrote a number of &quot;chansons de geste&quot; as well as many fabliaux. He lived in Arras.

==Writings==
Bodel wrote (&quot;Song of the Saxons&quot;) about the war of King Charlemagne with the Saxons and their leader Widukind, whom Bodel calls &quot;Guiteclin&quot;. He also wrote a miracle play called the &quot;Le Jeu de saint Nicolas&quot; (&quot;The Game of Saint Nicolas&quot;), which was probably first performed in Arras on 5 December 1200. Set in the middle of an epic battle between Christians and Muslims, the play tells the story of a good Christian who escapes the battle and is found praying to a statue of Saint Nicolas by the Muslim forces. The Muslim leader decides to test the saint by unlocking the doors to his treasury and leaving the statue as a guardian, stipulating that if anything were stolen the Christian would forfeit his life. Three thieves attempt to steal the treasure, but Saint Nicolas stops them. As a result, the Muslim ruler and his entire army convert to Christianity.

Like another French miracle play from the same time period, &quot;Le Miracle de Théophile&quot;, &quot;Le Jeu de saint Nicolas&quot; contains an invocation to the Devil in an unknown language:

::&quot;Palas aron ozinomas&quot;
::&quot;Baske bano tudan donas&quot;
::&quot;Geheamel cla orlay&quot;
::&quot;Berec hé pantaras tay&quot;

Bodel was the first person of record to classify the legendary themes and literary cycles known to medieval literature into the &quot;Three Matters&quot;.

His epic La Chanson de Saisnes (&quot;Song of the Saxons&quot;) contains the line:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Ne sont que III matières à nul homme atandant,&quot;
&quot;De France et de Bretaigne, et de Rome la grant.&quot;
&quot;Not but with three matters no man should attend:
Of France, and of Britain, and of Rome the grand.&quot; 
&lt;/poem&gt;

*the &quot;Matter of Rome&quot;, or retellings of stories from classical antiquity
*the &quot;Matter of Britain&quot;, concerning King Arthur and related topics
*the &quot;Matter of France&quot;, concerning Charlemagne and his paladins

Bodel contracted leprosy in 1202 or 1205, and entered a leprosarium. He then wrote a long farewell, &quot;Les Congés&quot;, his most personal and touching work.

<text>Alois Brunner (8 April 1912 – December 2001 or 2010) was an Austrian officer who held the rank of (captain) during World War II. Brunner played a significant role in the implementation of the Holocaust through rounding up and deporting Jews in occupied Austria, Greece, France, and Slovakia. He was known as Final Solution architect Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s right-hand man.

Brunner was responsible for sending over 100,000 European Jews from Austria, Greece, France and Slovakia to ghettos and concentration camps in eastern Europe. At the start of the war, he oversaw the deportation of 47,000 Austrian Jews to camps. In Greece, 43,000 Jews were deported in two months while he was stationed in Thessaloniki. He then became commander of the Drancy internment camp outside Paris from June 1943 to August 1944, during which nearly 24,000 men, women and children were sent to the gas chambers. His last assignment involved the destruction of the Jewish community of Slovakia.

After some narrow escapes from the Allies in the immediate aftermath of World War II, Brunner managed to elude capture and fled West Germany in 1954, first for Egypt, then Syria, where he remained until his death. He was the object of many manhunts, investigations, and assassination attempts over the years by different groups, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Klarsfelds and Mossad. In 1954 he was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; in France for crimes against humanity and sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment in 2001 (France had abolished the death penalty in 1981). In Syria, he lost an eye and then the fingers of his left hand as a result of letter bombs sent to him in 1961 and 1980, reportedly by Israeli intelligence. 

Starting in the 1990s and continuing for two decades, Brunner was one of the most-wanted Nazi war criminals. In November 2014, the Simon Wiesenthal Center reported that Brunner had died in Syria in 2010, and that he was buried somewhere in Damascus. However, recent information based on new evidence uncovered during a 2017 investigation point to December 2001 as the time of his death in Damascus, Syria. The German intelligence agency Verfassungsschutz claims he died in 2010. Brunner&#x27;s exact date and place of death remain unknown.

==Early life==
Alois Brunner was born on 8 April 1912 in the town of Vas, Austria-Hungary (now Rohrbrunn, Burgenland, Austria), the son of Joseph Brunner and Ann Kruise. He joined the Nazi Party at the age of sixteen and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) a year later. In 1933, Brunner moved to Germany where he joined the Nazi paramilitary group Austrian Legion. After the annexation of Austria in 1938 he volunteered with the SS and was assigned to the staff of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Vienna becoming its director in 1939. Following the German occupation of the Czech lands on 15 March 1939 he was sent to the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to accelerate the emigration of Czech Jews. Brunner became known as Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s right-hand man.

==Second World War==
After the war started, Brunner worked closely with Eichmann on the Nisko Plan, a failed attempt to set up a Jewish reservation in Poland, Brunner managed by October 1939 to organise the deportation of more than 1,500 Viennese Jews to Nisko, Poland. Over time Brunner supervised the deportation of 56,000 Austrian Jews. In October 1942, he was transferred to Berlin to implement his method there.
Brunner held the rank of SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (captain) when he organized deportations to Nazi concentration camps from Vichy France and Slovakia. He was commander of a train of Jews deported from Vienna to Riga in February 1942. En route, Brunner shot and killed Jewish financier Siegmund Bosel, who, although ill, had been hauled out of a Vienna hospital and placed on the train. According to historian Gertrude Schneider, who as a young girl was deported to Riga on the same train, but survived the Holocaust:

Before being named commander of Drancy internment camp near Paris in June 1943, Brunner deported 43,000 Jews from Vienna and 46,000 from Salonika. He was personally sent by Eichmann in 1944 to Slovakia to oversee the deportation of Jews. In the last days of the Third Reich, he managed to deport another 13,500 from Slovakia to Theresienstadt, Sachsenhausen, Bergen-Belsen, and Stutthof of whom a few survived; the remainder, including all the children, were sent to Auschwitz, where none are known to have survived. According to some accounts, Brunner was responsible for the deportation of 129,000 people to death camps.

While serving as the commandant at Drancy, Brunner was remembered for his exceptional brutality. He personally conducted interrogations of new prisoners, and survivors of the camp have claimed that his office was covered in bloodstains and bullet holes. He instituted torture even for slight offences. As he was personally responsible to Eichmann, he circumvented the typical chain of command that included Helmut Knochen, the Chief of the SS in Paris, and Heinz Rothke, the Jewish Affairs expert of the German police. He introduced a rigid system of categorization to control the inmates using information about their race and ethnicity derived from the interrogations. He deliberately misled prisoners about the living standards of their destinations at the extermination camps in the General Government, including Auschwitz-Birkenau. Brunner also led round-ups of Jews in the Italian Military Administration of France when the Germans assumed control in 1943 following the Armistice of Cassibile, ended all legal exemptions preventing Jews from being deported by Vichy France, and extended the deportations to Jews of French nationality. He continued deportations and arrests even as the Allies and the Free French Forces advanced towards Paris.

While the Wehrmacht was already retreating from France, Brunner had 1,327 Jewish children arrested and deported in Paris between July 20 and 24, 1944. Brunner left Paris on August 17 in 1944, a week before the liberation of Paris, on the last train from the Drancy transit camp with fifty-one deported people, including Georges André Kohn (Bullenhuser Damm), and other German military personnel. His intention was to use the deportees as potential hostages.

Brunner had 23,500 Jews of all ages deported from France to the concentration camps. From 30 September 1944 to 31 March 1945 he smashed the Jewish underground movement in Slovakia and headed the Sereď concentration camp, from where he had approximately 11,500 people deported to Auschwitz, Sachsenhausen, Bergen-Belsen, and Terezín for extermination.

==Postwar flight and escape to Syria==
In a 1985 interview with the West German magazine &quot;Bunte&quot;, Brunner described how he escaped capture by the Allies immediately after World War II. The identity of Brunner was apparently mixed up with that of another SS member with the same surname, Anton Brunner, who was executed for war crimes. Alois, like Josef Mengele, did not have the SS blood type tattoo, which prevented his identity from detection in an Allied prison camp. Anton Brunner, who had worked in Vienna deporting Jews, was confused after the war with Alois due to the shared surname, including by historians such as Gerald Reitlinger.

Claiming he had &quot;received official documents under a false name from American authorities&quot;, Brunner claimed he had found work as a driver for the United States Army in the period after the war.

It has been alleged that Brunner found a working relationship after World War II with the Gehlen Organization.

He fled West Germany only in 1954, on a fake Red Cross passport, first to Rome, then Egypt, where he worked as a weapons dealer, and then to Syria, where he took the pseudonym of Dr Georg Fischer. In Syria, he was hired as a government adviser. The exact nature of his work is unknown. Syria had long refused entry to French investigators as well as to Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld, who spent nearly 15 years bringing the case to court in France. Simon Wiesenthal tried unsuccessfully to trace Brunner&#x27;s whereabouts. However, East Germany, led by Erich Honecker, negotiated with Syria in the late 1980s to have Brunner extradited and arrested in Berlin. The government of Syria under Hafez al-Assad was close to extraditing Brunner to East Germany, but the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 severed contacts and halted the extradition plan. During his long residence in Syria, Brunner was reportedly granted asylum, a generous salary and protection by the ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party in exchange for his advice on effective torture and interrogation techniques used by the Germans in World War II.

In the &quot;Bunte&quot; interview, Brunner was quoted as saying he regrets nothing and that all of the Jews deserved their fate. In a 1987 telephone interview with Chuck Ashman, published in the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot;, Brunner was reported to have said: &quot;All of [the Jews] deserved to die because they were the Devil&#x27;s agents and human garbage. I have no regrets and would do it again.&quot; (While the attribution of this quotation to Brunner was never directly disputed, Ashman was a controversial figure among his peers as journalists, and had previously been convicted of check fraud.) In an interview with Austrian neo-Nazi Gerd Honsik, Brunner denied claims of gas chambers.

Until the early 1990s, he lived in an apartment building on 7 Rue Haddad in Damascus, meeting with foreigners and occasionally being photographed. In the 1990s, the French Embassy received reports that Brunner was meeting regularly and having tea with former East German nationals. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he was last seen alive by reliable witnesses in 1992.

In December 1999, unconfirmed reports surfaced that Brunner had died in 1996 and been buried in a Damascus cemetery. However, he was reportedly sighted at the Meridian Hotel in Damascus by German journalists that same year, where he was said to be living under police protection. The last reported sighting of him was at the Meridian Hotel in late 2001 by German journalists.

In 2011, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported that the German intelligence service Bundesnachrichtendienst had destroyed its file on Brunner in the 1990s, and that remarks in remaining files contain conflicting statements as to whether Brunner had worked for the BND at some point.

==Assassination attempts==
In 1961 and 1980, letter bombs were sent to Brunner while he was a resident in Syria. As a result of the letter bomb he received in 1961, he lost an eye, and in 1980, he lost the fingers on his left hand when the parcel blew up in his hands. A 2018 article in &quot;Newsweek&quot; by journalist Ronen Bergman disclosed that the 1961 bomb was sent by Military Intelligence Unit 188, a branch of the Israel Defense Forces, and was the first target of a new method of letter bomb that was developed for deployment against ex-Nazi scientists working for Gamal Abdel Nasser in developing missiles targeting Israel. The article, excerpted from Bergman&#x27;s book &quot;Rise and Kill First&quot;, says that Brunner was located by Israeli spy Eli Cohen. 

According to information released by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad in 2017, it was behind the 1980 letter bomb attack. After intelligence gathering revealed that Brunner had previously bought herbs from an Austrian mail order firm, Mossad agents broke into its office to steal brochures and envelopes with the company logo. After a suitable explosive device was created in Israel, the agents then returned to the town in Austria where the office was located in order to post the letter bomb, however the slot in the mailbox was too small for it to fit. This necessitated in the agents having to repackage the device into a smaller envelope with less explosives, which resulted in Brunner only being injured rather than being killed outright in the blast it created.

==Convictions in absentia==
Germany and other countries unsuccessfully requested his extradition. He was twice sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; in the 1950s; one of those convictions was in France in 1954. In August 1987, an Interpol &quot;red notice&quot; was issued for him. In 1995, German state prosecutors in Cologne and Frankfurt posted a $330,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.

On 2 March 2001, he was found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; by a French court for crimes against humanity, including the arrest and deportation of 345 orphans from the Paris region (which had not been judged in the earlier trials) and was sentenced to life imprisonment. According to Serge Klarsfeld, the trial was largely symbolic—an effort to honour the memories of victims. Klarsfeld&#x27;s own father, arrested in 1943, was reportedly one of Brunner&#x27;s victims.

==Later attempts to locate==
In 2004, the television series &quot;Unsolved History&quot;, in an episode titled &quot;Hunting Nazis&quot;, used facial recognition software to compare Alois Brunner&#x27;s official SS photograph with a recent photo of &quot;Georg Fischer&quot; from Damascus, and came up with a match of 8.1 points out of 10, which they claimed was, despite the elapse of over 50 years in aging, equivalent to a match with 95% certainty.

In 2005, Brazilian police were reportedly investigating whether a suspect living in the country under an assumed name was actually Alois Brunner. Deputy Commander Asher Ben-Artzi, the head of Israel&#x27;s Interpol and Foreign Liaison Section, passed on a Brazilian request for Brunner&#x27;s fingerprints to Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff, head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, but Zuroff could not find any.

In July 2007, the Austrian Justice Ministry declared that they would pay €50,000 for information leading to his arrest and extradition to Austria.

In March 2009, the Simon Wiesenthal Center acknowledged the &quot;slim&quot; possibility of Brunner still being alive. In 2011, some media reports included him on a list of &quot;World&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; criminals.

In 2013, the Simon Wiesenthal Center described Brunner as &quot;the most important unpunished Nazi war criminal who may still be alive&quot;. Brunner was last seen in 2001 in Syria, whose government had long rebuffed international efforts to locate or apprehend him, but was presumed dead .

In April 2014, Brunner was removed from the Simon Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s list of most-wanted Nazi war criminals.

==Death==
On 30 November 2014, the Simon Wiesenthal Center reported receiving credible information that Brunner had died in Syria in 2010. He would have been 97 or 98 years old. Partly due to the ongoing Syrian Civil War, the exact date and place of death were unknown. 

According to the director of the Wiesenthal Center, Efraim Zuroff, the information came from a &quot;reliable&quot; former German secret service agent who had served in the Middle East. The information was also reported in the press. The new evidence revealed that Brunner was buried in an unknown location in Damascus around 2010, unrepentant of his crimes to the end. Zuroff said that, owing to the civil war in Syria, the exact location of Brunner&#x27;s grave was unknowable.

In 2017, the French quarterly review &quot;&quot; published an investigation about Brunner&#x27;s last years in Syria by journalists Hédi Aouidj and Mathieu Palain. Three former security guards in charge of the protection of Brunner recounted how the Assad family used him to train intelligence services staff, then afterwards kept him under house arrest in a Damascus basement throughout the 1990s until his death in December 2001. One of the former guards said that Brunner, who went by the name of Abu Hussein, &quot;suffered and cried a lot in his final years&quot;, &quot;couldn&#x27;t even wash&quot; and ate only &quot;an egg or a potato&quot; a day. According to the report at the time of his death, Brunner&#x27;s body was washed according to Islamic rites. Brunner was buried in secret, at night in the Al-Affif cemetery in Damascus. Serge Klarsfeld called the report &quot;highly credible&quot;. In March 2021, the district court in Vienna-Döbling officially declared him dead.

<text>The Robert Simpson Company Limited, commonly known as Simpson&#x27;s until 1972, then as Simpsons, and in Quebec sometimes as Simpson, was a Canadian department store chain that had its earliest roots in a store opened in 1858 by Robert Simpson.

In 1952 Simpson&#x27;s started a 50-50 joint venture in Canada named Simpsons-Sears Limited (later Sears Canada) with Sears, Roebuck, the American retailer. Simpsons-Sears stores remained distinct from the Simpson&#x27;s stores and the parent companies&#x27; agreement included language to keep them from competing too directly with each other.

The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) purchased the Simpsons-branded stores in 1978, but they were later converted to The Bay stores by the early 1990s. As part of the 1978 agreement, U.S.-based Sears acquired full ownership of Simpsons-Sears Limited.

== History ==

Robert Simpson&#x27;s original store (Simpson &amp; Bogart after 1861), was opened in 1858 in Newmarket, Ontario at what is now 226-228 Main Street South (original building since demolished). 
it was co-founded with William Trent as &quot;Simpson &amp; Trent Groceries, Boots, Shoes and Dry Goods&quot;. A fire destroyed the store in 1870, and a new dry goods store was opened two years later in Toronto. Robert Simpson lived at 384 Botsford Street in Newmarket from 1861 to 1876.

The company was renamed the Robert Simpson Company Limited in May 1896, not long before Robert Simpson&#x27;s sudden death on 14 December 1897, at the age of 63. With no male heir, Simpson&#x27;s death placed a heavy burden on his wife, Mary, and daughter, Margaret. They sold the business for $135,000 in March 1898 to a syndicate of three Toronto businessmen, Harris Henry Fudger (1852–1930), Joseph Flavelle, and Alfred Ernest Ames (1866–1934).
In 1912, Charles Luther (C.L.) Burton became assistant general manager at the Robert Simpson Company, then under the directorship of his old friend and mentor, H. H. Fudger. By 1929, Burton was president of Simpson&#x27;s, becoming chairman of the board in 1948, when his son Edgar assumed the presidency.
The store in downtown Toronto included one of the city&#x27;s most exclusive restaurants, the Arcadian Court, which opened in 1929 and still operates today (as an event space) after the store&#x27;s acquisition by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1978. Throughout its history, Simpsons was the traditional carriage-trade department store in Toronto, competing with the T. Eaton Company. The motto &quot;You&#x27;ll enjoy shopping at Simpson&#x27;s&quot; was conceived by Robert Simpson and remained the company&#x27;s slogan until its acquisition by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

===Simpsons-Sears===

In 1952, General Robert E. Wood, the Chairman of U.S. retailer Sears, Roebuck and Co., sent a letter to Edgar G. Burton, President of the Robert Simpson Company of Toronto, proposing a partnership between their two companies in order to serve the Canadian market. The deal to create Simpsons-Sears Limited, a Canadian catalogue and department store chain separate from the Simpsons chain, was signed on September 18, 1952, and the terms were 50-50. Each company put up $20 million and had equal representation on the new company&#x27;s board of directors. The new company was to have two main objectives. The first was to expand Simpsons&#x27; existing mail-order business, which was sold to the new company. The second goal was to build a string of stores modelled on Sears, Roebuck&#x27;s format right across the country.

The agreement also contained a provision that would prove to be a major bone of contention in the coming years. Under its terms, Simpsons-Sears could not open a retail store within 25 miles of Simpson&#x27;s existing stores in Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Regina and London. In return, Simpson&#x27;s promised not to build any stores outside of those five cities. Simpsons-Sears mail-order business, however, was free to operate anywhere in Canada, and so was the new Simpsons-Sears Acceptance Company, the credit arm of the operation.

The business operations of Simpsons-Sears began when the first Simpsons-Sears Spring/Summer Catalogue rolled off the presses of Photo-Engravers and Electrotypers, Ltd. and were delivered to 300,000 Canadian homes in early 1953.

On Thursday, September 17, 1953, the first Simpsons-Sears retail store opened in Stratford, Ontario at 9:15 a.m. The second Simpsons-Sears store opened in Kamloops, B.C., in December of that year.

In the 1960s, Simpson&#x27;s was among the first 10 Canadian companies to start using computers in all their locations, and programming was done in Toronto and Montreal by accounting clerks, many of whom were women. Enormous rooms with special ventilation were built to house IBM punch card mainframe machines in those two locations.

In 1972, Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears agreed to end the 25-mile restriction and permit Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears stores anywhere. The following year, when Simpsons-Sears opened a store in the city of Mississauga, approximately west of Toronto, the company decided to use the &quot;Sears&quot; name alone in order to prevent confusion with Simpsons stores operating in Toronto.

===Acquisition by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company===

In 1978, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company acquired Simpsons and federal competition law required the partnership to terminate, thus Simpsons and Simpsons-Sears could no longer share facilities. Sears stores continued to carry the Simpsons-Sears name on signage and the name remained in use both informally and as its business name well into the 1980s. Simpsons-Sears officially changed its name to Sears Canada in 1984.

Simpsons closed on June 27, 1981, the store in Regina, Saskatchewan it had operated since 1916 after four consecutive years of financial losses with that location. It also closed its only store in Ottawa on January 29, 1983. The 83,000 square feet multi-level store had never been profitable ever since Simpsons acquired it in June 1972 and was notorious for not having any escalators.

In March 1983, The Bay store at Mayflower Mall in Sydney, Nova Scotia was rebranded to Simpsons.

In July 1984, Simpsons terminated 1,631 employees, including more than a thousand in Toronto alone. Simpsons lost $53 million that year alone.

The flagship store&#x27;s acquisition of a large quantity of toy robots was a major plot point in the movie &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; in 1988.

Simpsons vanished from Greater Montreal in 1989 with its five stores either converted to The Bay or simply closed, leaving the chain with a presence only in the Toronto area. HBC acknowledged at the time that Simpsons wasn&#x27;t doing great in Toronto but was still performing well enough to continue there and even planned to add three more locations to the existing 11 stores in the area. That year, the flagship Simpsons store in downtown Toronto completed a $30 million facelift with a relaunch known as the &quot;Miracle on Queen Street&quot;. Its cosmetics area was reputed to be the largest in the world and the basement featured a gourmet food hall similar to Macy&#x27;s in Herald Square in New York City or Harrods in London. The St. Regis Room expanded and upscale shops such as Alfred Dunhill of London opened boutiques in the store.

===The end===
The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company attempted to operate Simpsons as a more-upscale nameplate than its main brand, The Bay, but was unsuccessful. The chain&#x27;s operations in Greater Toronto were merged with The Bay in 1991 and the Simpsons name was retired after a retail presence of almost 120 years.

Reasons for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s decision were the recession and the fact that it rarely made profits with the Simpsons stores ever since the acquisition in the late 1970s. Simpsons struggled to stand out from The Bay. Although Simpsons was slightly higher end than The Bay, the distinction was hardly noticeable to the average shopper. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company came to the conclusion that it would be better to rationalize its operations than to divide its customer base. Much of the operations of Simpsons and The Bay, such as purchasing, advertising and credit cards, had already been consolidated by the time HBC decided to merge the two chains. The Simpsons chain also suffered from an identity crisis within itself, with an upscale flagship downtown store filled with high-end merchandise in contrast to the mid-priced suburban mall locations that were basically like The Bay. When the merger was announced in June 1991, it had been suggested that the downtown location continue operating as a Simpsons store but HBC turned down the idea under the explanation that it would be too expensive to implement such plan.

Finally, the demise of Simpsons came at a time when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was seriously controlling its operating costs in anticipation of an eventual entrance to Canada by American giant Wal-Mart which was already conquering the retail landscape in its country and attracting Canadians living close to the border.

== Legacy==

The Simpsons store on Queen Street West in Toronto continues to operate under the Hudson&#x27;s Bay nameplate as the chain&#x27;s, and Canada&#x27;s, largest department store. The adjacent Simpson Tower, which used to house Simpsons offices, served as the main headquarters for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company until the mid-2010s which still maintains some activities in the building.

In 1991, Sears Canada acquired several Simpsons locations in the Toronto market, primarily where HBC had both Bay and Simpsons stores operating within the same shopping centre. When Simpsons folded in 1991, eight of its stores were absorbed by The Bay. The other six Simpsons stores were sold to Sears. Sears also acquired two existing The Bay stores at the Scarborough Town Centre and Yorkdale shopping malls. On the other hand, the Sears store at the Burlington Mall was sold to The Bay. The stores that went to The Bay were all rebranded on August 14, 1991. The locations that Sears acquired were closed in July 1991, renovated and progressively reopened at various dates in August and September 1991 with the former Simpsons/The Bay employees. The Sears store at Mapleview Mall in particular opened on August 14, 1991, the same date The Bay replaced its Simpsons locations. None of Simpsons&#x27; locations in 1991 closed outright as they were all changed to either The Bay or Sears stores with limited job losses.

Of the Simpsons stores in Quebec, three of them - Anjou, Pointe-Claire and Laval - switched to The Bay on January 29, 1989. The three locations were rebranded in March 1989 after a transition period as Simpsons stores operated by The Bay. The other two Simpsons locations, in downtown Montreal and St-Bruno, closed because there were existing The Bay stores near them. HBC unsuccessfully tried to find a buyer for the Simpsons store in St-Bruno. The Bay store in St-Bruno eventually relocated to Simpsons&#x27; vacated location that same year. The downtown store closed on January 28, 1989, but reopened in mid-February for its final sale. After its clearance concluded on April 8, 1989, it was converted the following week (on April 15) as a Simpsons-branded liquidation centre, using 50 of the 900 employees of the original store and only two of the floors. The building later sat vacant for many years in the heart of the city&#x27;s shopping district until it was turned in 1999 into a mall named Carrefour Industrielle Alliance, anchored by La Maison Simons and Famous Players (today Scotiabank Theatre).

The Simpsons stores outside of the Greater Toronto and Greater Montreal areas were actually the first to be converted to The Bay on July 30, 1986. This included the stores in the province of Nova Scotia as well as Ontario locations in London, Kitchener, Kingston and Windsor. Like the ones in the Toronto and Montreal, many of these The Bay stores are still standing including those at White Oaks Mall, Cataraqui Centre, Fairview Park Mall, Devonshire Mall, Mic Mac Mall and Mayflower Mall. The Bay in Halifax, closed in 2011, was among the Simpsons stores rebranded in 1986.

After the Simpsons chain ceased to exist in 1991, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company continued to accept Simpsons credit cards in its The Bay and Zellers stores until the company launched the HBC credit card in 2001.

The Canadian Intellectual Property Office database reports that the trademark to the name &quot;Simpsons&quot; was owned by Sears Canada from 2001 to 2008. It was purchased from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 2001, ten years after the name had been retired. In 2008, Sears Canada transferred all of its trademarks (including the Simpsons trademark) to 1373639 Alberta Ltd., which appears to be a shell company of Sears Canada.

=== St. Regis Room and West End Shop ===

The two most &quot;exclusive&quot; clothing departments in the former Simpsons downtown Toronto location, the St. Regis Room (now known as the Room and extensively renovated in late 2009 by Yabu Pushelberg) for women and the West End Shop for men, are still in operation at the Bay&#x27;s downtown Toronto Queen Street store. Designers in the St. Regis Room include Givenchy, Christian Lacroix, Valentino, Armani Collezioni, Louis Féraud, Karl Lagerfeld, Balmain, Andrew Gn, Lida Baday, Bellville Sassoon, David Hayes, and others. The West End shop designers include Hugo Boss, Strellson, and others.

While operated by Simpsons, the St. Regis Room offered some of the most exclusive fashion collections in Canada. Christian Dior, Oscar de la Renta, Yves Saint Laurent, Claude Montana, André Courrèges, and many others were featured in this luxury store.

<text>Primacord is a brand of detonating cord used in blasting. It was developed in 1936 by the Ensign-Bickford Company. Ensign-Bickford sold their registered trademark for Primacord to Dyno Nobel in 2003. which manufactures it in their Graham, Kentucky factory. The name is also used as a genericized trademark for any detonating cord.

==Description==
Primacord consists of a continuous core of PETN, RDX or other high explosive, bound by textile yarns and finished with plastic and wax as waterproofing agents. It is produced in eight strengths:

Primaline is a related product differing principally in having a plastic jacket instead of textile. Primaline is also available in higher loadings, up to 85 g/m (400 gr/ft):

==Operation==
Primacord is initiated with a blasting cap or by a &quot;donor line&quot; of detonating cord or other high explosive. It detonates along its entire length at a velocity of approximately per second. It is used to create explosive effects and to build reliable explosive charges. It is used in conjunction with other high explosive materials to form charges, including linear charges, capable of near instantaneous results.

<doc id="323177" wikidata="Q3033947" url="?curid=323177" title="Dollarama">
<text>Dollarama Inc. is a Canadian dollar store retail chain headquartered in Mount Royal, Quebec. Since 2009, it has been Canada&#x27;s biggest retailer of items for five dollars or less. Dollarama has over 1400 stores and is active in all of Canada; Ontario has the most stores.

==History==
===Rossy S Inc.===
The first all-dollar store was founded in Montreal in 1910 by Salim Rassy, a Lebanese immigrant, whose name became Rossy. His son George took over the retailer in 1937 and led the company until his death in 1973 when grandson Larry Rossy assumed leadership of it when it had 20 stores.

===Dollarama ===
The discount retailer grew to 44 stores by 1992 which until then operated under the name Rossy S Inc. (not to be confused with Rossy Michael, a similar chain founded in 1949 by another son of Salim Rassy). That year, Larry Rossy opened the first Dollarama at the shopping center &quot;Les Promenades du St-Laurent&quot; in Matane. The Dollarama division rapidly became the primary source of revenue for the Rossy family. As such, the Rossy S chain was discontinued and all of its stores had either closed outright or been converted into Dollarama locations by the turn of the new millennium. After converting all the locations to the dollar store concept, Larry Rossy continued to open new stores eventually reaching 1,000 stores in 2015. In November 2004, 80 percent of the chain was sold for $850 million US, to a private equity fund, Bain Capital, of Boston, Massachusetts.

===Post IPO===
Dollarama&#x27;s initial public offering took place on October 9, 2009. In 2013, Dollarama was planning to expand its market to Latin America, and made an eight-year agreement to share its business expertise and offer sourcing services to Dollarcity, a Salvadoran chain of dollar stores in Central America and Colombia.

In 2016, Dollarama established a partnership with the Marco G. R. Enterprise, resulting in the sponsorship of the first edition of the Formula Windsor Championship.

In 2018, Dollarama recalled over 50,000 children&#x27;s toys due to dangerous levels of phthalates.

The number of stores in October 2021 was 539 in Ontario, 379 in Québec, 134 in Alberta, 111 in British Columbia, 42 in New Brunswick, 41 in Manitoba, 40 in Nova Scotia, 40 in Saskatchewan, 25 in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 5 in Prince Edward Island. The company announced that it would open 700 new locations across Canada (including a few replacements for some of the Great Canadian Dollar Store locations) in the aforementioned provinces as well as their first store in the Yukon Territory.
==Business practices==

Many items are priced at $1.00 or less, and initially almost all items were priced as such. In early 2009, Dollarama began to introduce items priced up to $2.00 (including $1.25 and $1.50 price points). Due to the positive response from consumers to the multi-price point strategy, the stores introduced items at $2.50 and $3.00 in August 2012. It again increased price points to include $3.50 and $4.00 items in August 2016. In 2022, Dollarama announced that its maximum price point would be increasing to $5.00. This price level increase allowed the chain to acquire products from a greater variety of sources, including closeout sales. Adjustments may eventually happen to all prices. Dollarama has always had a No Return and No Exchange Policy, stating an item cannot be given back to the store once a purchase is complete.

Payment in Dollarama stores was once by cash only, until Interac debit cards were added as a payment option beginning in 2008. Gift cards began to be offered in 2011. As of 2015, all Dollarama stores also support contact-less Interac Flash payments. In March 2017, Dollarama announced that credit cards would be offered as a payment option at all stores by the end of summer 2018. Customers will be able to pay with Visa, Mastercard, and American Express, following a successful pilot program.

Many Dollarama stores were opened in place of former locations of the now defunct BiWay, which closed after a series of dubious financial transactions involving a new owner of the parent operation. Dollarama launched its online store on January 21, 2019 where it will sell many of its products in bulk. Only 1000 of the roughly 4000 products offered in Dollarama stores will be sold online, namely items that are easily purchased in bulk.

<text>Hans Modrow (; 27 January 1928 – 10 February 2023) was a German politician best known as the last communist premier of East Germany.

Taking office in the middle of the Peaceful Revolution, he was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the country for much of the winter of 1989 and 1990. He was a transitional figure, paving the way to the first and only free elections in East Germany and including many opposition politicians in his cabinet.

After the end of Communist rule and reunification of Germany, he was convicted of electoral fraud and perjury by the Dresden District Court in 1995, on the basis that he had been the Socialist Unity Party (SED) official nominally in charge of the electoral process. He was later convicted of the first charge and was given a nine-month suspended sentence. One of the few high-ranking former SED officials to not have been expelled, he was the honorary chairman of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and was the president of the &quot;council of elders&quot; of the Left Party from 2007.

==Early life and education==
Modrow was born on 27 January 1928 in Jasenitz, Province of Pomerania, German Reich, now Jasienica, part of the town of Police in Poland. As a child he was a Hitler Youth leader and attended a Volksschule. He trained as a machinist from 1942 to 1945 when he was filled with intense hatred of the Bolsheviks, whom he deemed as subhumans, inferior to Germans physically and morally. For six months during the Allied bombing of Stettin he served as a volunteer firefighter. He later served briefly in the Volkssturm in January 1945, and was subsequently captured as a prisoner of war by the Soviet Red Army in Stralsund in May 1945. He and other German prisoners were sent to a farm in Hinterpommern to work. Upon arrival, his backpack was stolen, making him begin to rethink the Germans&#x27; so-called camaraderie. Days later, he was appointed a driver to a Soviet captain, who asked him about Heinrich Heine, a German poet. Modrow had never heard of him and felt embarrassed that the people he thought of as &quot;subhumans&quot; knew more about German culture than he. Transported to a POW camp near Moscow, he joined a National Committee for a Free Germany anti-fascist school run by future SED Politburo member Alfred Neumann for Wehrmacht members and received training in Marxism–Leninism, which he embraced. Upon release in 1949 he worked as a machinist for LEW Hennigsdorf. That same year he joined the Socialist Unity Party (SED).

From 1949 to 1961, Modrow worked in various functions for the Free German Youth (FDJ) in Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, and Berlin and in 1952 and 1953 studied at the Komsomol college in Moscow. In 1953, he attended the state funeral of Joseph Stalin. After Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech at the 20th Party Congress condemning Stalin and beginning de-Stalinization, Modrow claimed to have complained to his former teacher Neumann &quot;Comrade, this is unacceptable — you are accusing us of having learned Stalin off by heart, but I never had the inclination to do this myself, you asked us to!&quot; From 1953 to 1961, he served as an FDJ functionary in East Berlin. From 1954 to 1957, he studied at the SED&#x27;s Karl Marx school in Berlin, graduating as a social scientist. In 1959 to 1961 he studied at the University of Economics in Berlin-Karlshorst and obtained the degree of graduate economist. He gained his doctorate at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 1966. West Germany&#x27;s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) kept Modrow under observation from 1958 to 2013.

==Communist party career==

Modrow had a long political career in East Germany, serving as a member of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; from 1957 to 1990 and in the SED&#x27;s Central Committee (ZK) from 1967 to 1989, having previously been a candidate for the ZK from 1958 to 1967. From 1961 to 1967 he was first secretary of the district administration of the SED in Berlin-Köpenick and secretary for agitation and propaganda from 1967 to 1971 in the SED&#x27;s district leadership in Berlin. During this time he was involved in the formation of the Union Berlin football club, which is based in the Köpenick district. From 1971 to 1973 he worked as the head of the SED&#x27;s Department for Agitation. In 1975 he was awarded the GDR&#x27;s Patriotic Order of Merit in gold and received the award of the Order of Karl Marx in 1978.

From 1973 onward, he was the SED&#x27;s first secretary in Bezirk Dresden, making him &quot;de facto&quot; leader of East Germany&#x27;s third-largest Bezirk. He was prevented from rising any further than a regional party boss, largely because he was one of the few SED leaders who dared to publicly criticise longtime SED chief Erich Honecker. He developed some important contacts with the Soviet Union, including eventual Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Modrow initially supported Gorbachev&#x27;s glasnost and perestroika reforms. In early 1987, Gorbachev and the KGB explored the possibility of installing Modrow as Honecker&#x27;s successor. From 1988 to 1989, the Stasi, under the orders of Honecker and Erich Mielke, conducted a massive surveillance operation against Modrow with the intention of gathering enough evidence to convict him of high treason.

==Peaceful Revolution and premiership==
During the Peaceful Revolution of 1989, Modrow ordered thousands of Volkspolizei, Stasi, Combat Groups of the Working Class, and National People&#x27;s Army troops to crush a demonstration at the Dresden Hauptbahnhof on 4–5 October. Some 1,300 people were arrested. In a top secret and encrypted telex to Honecker on 9 October, Modrow reported: &quot;With the determined commitment of the comrades of the security organs, anti-state terrorist riots were suppressed&quot;.

When Honecker was toppled on 18 October, Gorbachev hoped that Modrow would become the new leader of the SED. Egon Krenz was selected instead. He became premier following the resignation of Willi Stoph on 13 November, four days after the Berlin Wall fell. The SED formally abandoned power on 1 December. Krenz resigned two days later, on 3 December. Since the premiership was the highest state post in East Germany, Modrow became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the country.

To defeat the opposition&#x27;s demand for the complete dissolution of the Stasi, it was renamed as the &quot;Office for National Security&quot; (Amt für Nationale Sicherheit – AfNS) on 17 November 1989. Modrow&#x27;s attempt to re-brand it further as the &quot;Office for the Protection of the Constitution of the GDR&quot; (Verfassungsschutz der DDR) failed due to pressure from the public and the opposition parties and the AfNS was dissolved on 13 January 1990. The Modrow government gave orders to destroy incriminating Stasi files.

On 7 December 1989, Modrow accepted the proposal of the East German Round Table opposition groups to hold free elections within six months. Modrow and the Round Table agreed on 28 January to bring the elections forward to 18 March. By this time, the SED had added &quot;Party of Democratic Socialism&quot; to its name; the SED portion was dropped altogether in February. Some of the Round Table parties strove for a &quot;third way&quot; model of democratic socialism and therefore agreed with Modrow to slow down or block a reunification with capitalist West Germany. As the SED-PDS regime grew weaker, Modrow on 1 February 1990 proposed a slow, three-stage process that would create a neutral German confederation and continued to oppose &quot;rapid&quot; reunification. Popular sentiment in East Germany was clearly in favor of reunification and the PDS opposition to reunification was marginalized.

From 5 February 1990 on, Modrow included eight representatives of opposition parties and civil liberties groups as ministers without portfolio in his cabinet. On 13 February 1990, Modrow met with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, asking for an accommodation loan of 15 billion DM, which was rejected by Kohl. Modrow remained premier until the 18 March 1990 elections. The PDS expelled Honecker, Krenz, and other Communist-era leaders in February 1990.

On 27 May 1993, the Dresden District Court found Modrow guilty of electoral fraud committed in the Dresden municipal elections in May 1989, specifically, understating the percentage of voters who refused to vote for the official slate. The judge declined to impose a prison sentence or a fine. The Dresden District Court revoked the decision in August 1995 and Modrow was sentenced to nine months on probation. Modrow did not directly deny the charges, but argued that the trial was politically motivated and that the court lacked jurisdiction for crimes committed in East Germany. &quot;We were all members of a political system,&quot; he said, speaking to the court in Dresden. &quot;Some perhaps had the good fortune not to come into contact with manipulation, while others could not or were not allowed to turn away.&quot;

==Later life and death==
After German reunification, Modrow served as a member of the Bundestag (1990–1994) and of the European Parliament (1999–2004). After leaving office, he wrote a number of books on his political experiences, his continued Marxist political views, and his disappointment at the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Although a supporter of Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms in the 1980s, after the fall of Communism he criticised them for weakening the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s economy. In 2006, he suggested both West Germany and East Germany were responsible for the killings of East Germans by the communist regime at the Berlin Wall, and later defended the construction of the wall as a necessary measure to prevent a war over West Berlin. He also called East Germany an &quot;effective democracy&quot;. He was criticised for maintaining contacts with Neo-Stalinist groups. In 2018, he sued the Federal Intelligence Service for access to West German intelligence files on him from the Cold War. In 2019 he criticised the enlargement of NATO, which he also opposed reunified Germany&#x27;s membership in. Modrow died on 10 February 2023, aged 95. He was buried at Dorotheenstadt Cemetery.

<text>Uruguay is a presidential republic in which the president is both the head of state and head of government. The following is a list of all the people who have held the office of President of Uruguay since 6 November 1830 (when the first constitution was adopted), with the exception of those who held the office of &quot;President&quot; under the National Council of Government, which served as the country&#x27;s executive directory from 1955 to 1967. The first president of this list is Fructuoso Rivera, who held the office twice and once as part of the Triumvirate that ruled the country from 1853 to 1854.

Most of the presidents of Uruguay have belonged to the Colorado Party, a traditionally conservative party founded by Rivera in 1836, although there has not been a Colorado president since Jorge Batlle left office in 2005. The first free democratic elections for president were held in 1922. The current president is Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party, who was elected in the 2019 presidential election.

<doc id="323186" wikidata="Q583432" url="?curid=323186" title="Kenshō">
<text>Kenshō (Rōmaji; Japanese and classical Chinese: 見性, Pinyin: &quot;jianxing&quot;, Sanskrit: dṛṣṭi-svabhāva) is an East Asian Buddhist term from the Chan / Zen tradition which means &quot;seeing&quot; or &quot;perceiving&quot; () &quot;nature&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; (), or &#x27;true face&#x27;. It is usually translated as &quot;seeing one&#x27;s [true] nature,&quot; with &quot;nature&quot; referring to buddha-nature, ultimate reality, the Dharmadhatu. The term appears in one of the classic slogans which define Chan Buddhism: to see oneʼs own nature and accomplish Buddhahood (見性成佛).

Kenshō is an &quot;initial&quot; insight or sudden awakening, not full Buddhahood. It is to be followed by further training which deepens this insight, allows one to learn to express it in daily life and gradually removes the remaining defilements.

The Japanese term kenshō is often used interchangeably with satori, which is derived from the verb satoru, and means &quot;comprehension; understanding&quot;.

==Terminology==
The Chinese Buddhist term &quot;jianxing&quot; () compounds:
* &quot;jian&quot; &quot;see, observe, meet with, perceive&quot;;
* &quot;xing&quot; &quot;(inborn) nature, character, personality, disposition, property, quality, gender&quot;; also &#x27;true face&#x27;.

===History===
Buddhist monks who produced Sanskrit-Chinese translations of sutras faced many linguistic difficulties:
* They chose Chinese &quot;jian&quot; 見 to translate Sanskrit &quot;dṛś&quot; &quot;see, look&quot;, and the central Buddhist idea of &quot;dṛṣṭi&quot; &quot;view, seeing (also with the mind&#x27;s eye), wisdom, false view&quot;.
* Translators used &quot;xing&quot; 性 or &quot;zixing&quot; 自性 &quot;self-nature&quot; for Sanskrit &quot;svabhāva&quot; &quot;intrinsic nature, essential nature&quot;.
Thus, &quot;jianxing&quot; was the translation for &quot;dṛṣṭi-svabhāva&quot;, to &quot;view one&#x27;s essential nature&quot;.

The term is found in the Chinese &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; (c. 8th century; 2, Prajñā &quot;wisdom, understanding&quot;).

===Pronunciations===
The Standard Chinese pronunciation &quot;jianxing&quot; historically derives from (c. 7th century CE) Middle Chinese &quot;kienCsjäŋC&quot;. Sino-Xenic pronunciations of this term exist:
* &quot;kenshō&quot; 見性 or ケンショウ (&quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;) in Sino-Japanese vocabulary
* in Sino-Korean vocabulary
* &quot;kiến tính&quot; in Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary.

==Meanings==
Translating &quot;kenshō&quot; into English is semantically complex.

===Encyclopedic and dictionary definitions===
Some encyclopedia and dictionary definitions are:
* Soothill (1934): &quot;To behold the Buddha-nature within oneself, a common saying of the Chan (Zen) or Intuitive School.&quot;
* Fischer-Schreiber (1991): Lit. &quot;seeing nature&quot;; Zen expression for the experience of awakening (enlightenment). Since the meaning is &quot;seeing one&#x27;s own true nature,&quot; &quot;kenshō&quot; is usually translated &quot;self-realization.&quot; Like all words that try to reduce the conceptually ungraspable experience of enlightenment to a concept, this one is also not entirely accurate and is even misleading, since the experience contains no duality of &quot;seer&quot; and &quot;seen&quot; because there is no &quot;nature of self&#x27; as an object that is seen by a subject separate from it.
* Baroni (2002): &quot;Seeing one&#x27;s nature,&quot; that is, realizing one&#x27;s own original Buddha Nature. In the Rinzai school, it most often refers more specifically to one&#x27;s initial enlightenment attained through kōan practice.
* Muller (year unknown): To see one&#x27;s own originally enlightened mind. To behold the Buddha-nature within oneself, a common saying of the Chan school, as seen for example, in the phrase &#x27;seeing one&#x27;s nature, becoming Buddha&#x27; 見性成佛.

===Definitions by Buddhist scholars===
Buddhist scholars have defined &quot;kenshō&quot; as:
* D.T. Suzuki: &quot;Looking into one&#x27;s nature or the opening of satori&quot;; &quot;This acquiring of a new point of view in our dealings with life and the world is popularly called by Japanese Zen students &#x27;satori&#x27; (&quot;wu&quot; in Chinese). It is really another name for Enlightenment (&quot;Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi&quot;)&quot;.
* Dumoulin (1988/2005): &quot;Enlightenment is described here as an insight into the identity of one&#x27;s own nature with all of reality in an eternal now, as a vision that removes all distinctions. This enlightenment is the center and the goal of the Zen way. Hakuin prefers the term &quot;seeing into one&#x27;s nature&quot;, which for him means ultimate reality. The Buddha nature and the cosmic Buddha body, wisdom (&quot;prajna&quot;), and emptiness (&quot;sunyata&quot;), the original countenance one had before one was born, and other expressions from the rich palette of Mahayana terms were all familiar to him from his continued study of the sutras and Zen literature.&quot;
* Peter Harvey (1990): &quot;It is a blissful realization where a person&#x27;s inner nature, the originally pure mind, is directly known as an illuminating emptiness, a thusness which is dynamic and immanent in the world.&quot;
* G. Victor Sogen Hori (2000): &quot;The term consists of two characters: &quot;ken&quot;, which means &quot;see&quot; or &quot;seeing&quot;, and &quot;sho&quot;, which means &quot;nature&quot;, &quot;character&quot;, &quot;quality.&quot; To &quot;see one&#x27;s nature&quot; is the usual translation for &quot;kensho&quot;&quot;.

===Definitions by Buddhist teachers and practitioners===
Buddhist teachers and practitioners have defined &quot;kenshō&quot; as:
* Jiyu-Kennett: &quot;To see into one&#x27;s own nature. The experience of enlightenment, satori.&quot;
* Myodo Ni Satomi, a student of Hakuun Yasutani (1993): &quot;Seeing the-self, that is, the true self or Buddha nature.&quot;

===Further notions===
According to Hori, the term &quot;kenshō&quot; refers to the realization of non-duality of subject and object in general, but the term &quot;kenshō&quot; may also be applied in other contexts: &quot;How do you &quot;kenshō&quot; this?&quot;

&quot;Kenshō&quot; is not a single experience, but refers to a whole series of realizations from a beginner&#x27;s shallow glimpse of the nature of mind, up to a vision of emptiness equivalent to the &#x27;Path of Seeing&#x27; or to Buddhahood itself. In all of these, the same &#x27;thing&#x27; is known, but in different degrees of clarity and profundity.

&quot;Kenshō&quot; is commonly translated as enlightenment, a word that is also used to translate bodhi, prajna, satori and buddhahood. Western discourse tends to use these terms interchangeably, but there is a distinction between a first insight and the further development toward Buddhahood.

==Insight versus experience==
Kensho is insight, an understanding of our essential nature as Buddha-nature, or the nature of mind, the perceiving subject itself, which was equated with Buddha-nature by the East Mountain school.

Contemporary understanding also describes kensho as an &quot;experience&quot;, as in &quot;enlightenment experience&quot;; the term &quot;enlightenment experience&quot; is itself a tautology: &quot;Kensho (enlightenment) is an enlightenment (kensho)-experience&quot;. The notion of &quot;experience&quot; fits in a popular set of dichotomies: pure (unmediated) versus mediated, noncognitive versus cognitive, experiential versus intellectual, intuitive versus intellectual, nonrational versus rational, nondiscursive versus discursive, nonpropositional versus propositional.

The notion of &quot;pure experience&quot; (&quot;junsui kuiken&quot;) to interpret and understand kensho was introduced by Nishida Kitaro in his An Inquiry into the Good (1911), under influence of &quot;his somewhat idiosyncratic reading of western philosophy&quot;, especially William James, who wrote The Varieties of Religious Experience. Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential. D.T. Suzuki, who introduced Nishida Kitaro to western philosophy, took over this notion of &quot;pure experience&quot;, describing it as the essence of all religions, but best represented in what he considered the &quot;superior Japanese culture and religion&quot;.

The influence of western psychology and philosophy on Japanese Buddhism was due to the persecution of Buddhism at the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, and the subsequent efforts to construct a New Buddhism (&quot;shin bukkyo&quot;), adapted to the modern times. It was this New Buddhism which has shaped the understanding of Zen in the west, especially through the writings of D.T. Suzuki and the Sanbo Kyodan, an exponent of the Meiji-era opening of Zen-training for lay-followers.

The notion of &quot;experience&quot; has been criticised. Robert Sharf points out that &quot;experience&quot; is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of &quot;experience&quot; introduces a false notion of duality between &quot;experiencer&quot; and &quot;experienced&quot;, where-as the essence of kensho is the realisation of the &quot;non-duality&quot; of observer and observed. &quot;Pure experience&quot; does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what &quot;experience&quot; someone has, which means that this &quot;experience&quot; is not the &quot;proof&quot; of the teaching, but a &quot;result&quot; of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by &quot;cleaning the doors of perception&quot;, would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.
Ama Samy describes the notion of kensho-experience or awakening-experience as inherently dualistic and misguided:
Daoxin remarks on the experience of &quot;seeing emptiness&quot;:
The notion of &quot;experience&quot; also over-emphasises kensho, as if it were the single goal of Zen-training, where-as the Zen-tradition clearly states that &quot;the stink of Zen&quot; has to be removed and the &quot;experience&quot; of kensho has to be integrated into daily life. In the Rinzai-school this post-satori training includes the study and mastering of great amounts of classical Chinese poetry, which is far from &quot;universal&quot; and culture-transcending. On the contrary, it demands an education in culture-specific language and behaviour, which is measured by specific and strict cultural norms. Emphasising &quot;experience&quot; &quot;reduces the sophisticated dialectic of Ch&#x27;an/Zen doctrine and praxis to a mere &quot;means&quot; or set of techniques intended to inculcate such experiences&quot;.

==Kenshō accounts==

===Classical accounts===
Classical Zen texts, such as the &quot;Kao-seng-chuan&quot; (Biographies of Eminent Monks) and the transmission lists, called &quot;Transmission of the Lamp&quot; the &quot;yü-lü&quot; genre (the recorded sayings of the masters, such as the Línjì yǔlù); and the various koan-collections, contain accounts of &quot;enlightenment experiences&quot;. These accounts are not verbatim recordings of such &quot;experiences&quot;, but well-edited texts, written down decades after the supposed sayings and meetings.

&quot;The Denkōroku&quot;, &quot;The Record of the Transmission of the Light&quot;, written by Keizan Jōkin 瑩山紹瑾 (1268–1325), is an example of the &quot;Transmission of the Lamp&quot; genre. It contains literary accounts of the patriarchs of the Soto-lineage, from Shakyamuni Buddha to Koun Ejō, in which kensho plays a central role. They are not to be taken as literal accounts of awakening, but as stories underpinning the legitimacy of the Dogen-shu, which in its early history had seen a fierce internal conflict over the correct lineage during the Sandai sōron.

Dōgen Zenji&#x27;s awakening is recalled in the Denkoroku:
Hakuin gives this description of his first kensho, when he was 21:
Hakuin&#x27;s &quot;kensho&quot; was not approved by Shoju Rojin, who subjected Hakuin to more koan-training. This resulted in a second kensho, where-after Hakuin left Shoju Rojin. It was only when he was 41 that he attained &quot;his final great enlightenment&quot;:
===Contemporary accounts===
Although the Zen tradition is reluctant to speak openly about the &#x27;experience&#x27; of kensho, personal accounts can be found in Zen texts. Keido Fukushima, a 20th-century Rinzai abbott, gives the following description:
===Spontaneous kenshō===
Kenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher. For example, Richard Clarke (1933), who studied with Philip Kapleau, states that he had a spontaneous kensho when he was 13. Dennis Genpo Merzel states he had what he described as an &quot;awakening experience&quot; in 1971:
More descriptions of &quot;spontaneous kensho&quot; can be found throughout the Zen-literature,

===Alternate accounts===

Houn Jiyu-Kennett, a 20th-century Soto Zen Oshō, i.e. &quot;priest&quot; or &quot;teacher,&quot; and the first Western female Zen priest, had a prolonged religious experience in the 1970s, including a series of visions and recalling past lives, when she was severely ill. She regarded these experiences as &quot;a profound kensho (enlightenment) experience,&quot; constituting a third kensho, and published an account of these visions, and an elaborate scheme of stages of awakening, in &quot;How to Grow a Lotus Blossom&quot;. Her interpretations, which parallel Christian mysticism, were controversial, and rejected by some as &quot;makyo&quot; (&quot;illusion&quot;). According to Jiyu-Kennett, such experiences are not uncommon, but are rarely spoken of; she regarded publishing her own experiences as a way to acknowledge the existence and validity of such experiences, which, according to her, may contribute to further insight after initial awakening. She acknowledged the risks and potential for controversy in publishing her account, but felt that the benefits of releasing such information outweighed the risks.

==Training towards kenshō==
According to Harris, working towards kensho is usually a lengthy process stretched out over years or even decades. Contrary to this, Victor Hori notes that with koan-study kensho may appear within six months.
Sōtō tends towards a gradual approach, preferring to let the experiences happen on their own. Rinzai tends toward the use of Koans as a technique to unroot the habitual workings of the mind.

During intensive zazen various hallucinations and psychological disturbances may arise. These are referred to as makyo. Distinguishing these delusions from actual kensho is the primary function of the teacher, as the student may be erroneously convinced they have realized kensho.

===Rinzai===
In the Rinzai school, kensho is seen as indispensable:
In the Rinzai-training, the student is expected to pour oneself totally into both koan-study and daily activities &#x27;to become one&#x27; with it. Kenshō is used to describe the first breakthrough in kōan study.

===Sōtō===
Contemporary Japanese Sōtō downplays the importance of &quot;kenshō&quot;, due to the sectarian rivalry with Rinzai, which emphasizes &quot;kenshō&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;kenshō&quot; also has its role in Sōtō. The &quot;genjo-koan&quot;, or the &quot;koan of everyday life&quot; which &quot;appears naturally in daily life&quot;, is emphasized. Students are not encouraged to actively seek out kenshō experiences. In Sōtō practice kenshōs &quot;are allowed to occur naturally, as a by-product of practice. Meditative training is seen as the unfolding of one great &quot;kenshō&quot;:
According to Brad Warner, in the Sōtō school there are two kinds of awakening. One is the practice of shikantaza, which is the &quot;actual enlightened activity of the Buddha&quot;. The other is the accumulation of little bits of understanding, which come together, giving way to a deeper intuitive knowledge.

===Sanbō Kyōdan===
Kenshō also plays a central in the Sanbō Kyōdan, a Japanese Zen organisation which played a decisive role in the transmission of Zen to the United States. Yasutani, the founder of the Sanbo Kyodan, was disappointed about the lack of interest in kensho in the Soto school. Yasutani&#x27;s emphasis on koan training and the importance of kensho was transmitted to his American students:
It is also reflected in the inclusion of a relative great amount of kensho stories in &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen&quot;, written by Philip Kapleau, a student of Yasutani.

==Training after kenshō==
After kensho, further practice is needed to attain a natural, effortless, down-to-earth state of being, the &quot;ultimate liberation&quot;, &quot;knowing without any kind of defilement&quot;. Kensho may bring insight, but not change the mental dispositions, a shortcoming experienced by both Hakuin and modern teachers like Jack Kornfield and Barry Magid.

===Further practice===
Zen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life. According to the contemporary Chan Master Sheng Yen:
And the Soto Zen Master Jiyu-Kennett:
To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by Linji Yixuan in his Three mysterious Gates, Dongshan Liangjie&#x27;s (Japanese: Tōzan Ryōkan) Five Ranks, the Four Ways of Knowing of Hakuin, and the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures which detail the steps on the Path.

===Seitai choyo===
Post-awakening practice is called &quot;seitai choyo&quot;, the &quot;long nurturing of the sacred fetus&quot;. According to Spiegelberg,
During the T&#x27;ang-era, the term became associated with the ideal of the recluse who leaves the world. An ideal period of &quot;twenty years&quot; was taken for it, echoing a story from the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; about a prodigal son who wandered in poverty for twenty years before returning home. References to these twenty years are found throughout the Chán-tradition, for example Linji, who is reported to have studied under Huang-po for twenty years, and Daito, the founder of Daitoku-ji, who famously spent twenty years living under a bridge with beggars.

===Cultivating bodhicitta===
According to Hakuin, the main aim of &quot;post-satori practice&quot; (&quot;gogo no shugyo&quot; or &quot;kojo&quot;, &quot;going beyond&quot;) is to cultivate the &quot;Mind of Enlightenment&quot;, &quot;benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching&quot;. According to Yamada Koun, &quot;if you cannot weep with a person who is crying, there is no kensho&quot;. According to Kay,
According to Barry, regarding Hakuin&#x27;s practice after awakening,
===Self-purification and intellectual understanding===
One also has to purify oneself by ongoing practice, since 
And &quot;experience&quot; has to be supplemented by intellectual understanding and study of the Buddhist teachings; otherwise one remains a &quot;zen temma&quot;, a &quot;Zen devil&quot;.

==Sudden insight==
Kenshō is described as appearing suddenly, upon an interaction with someone else, at hearing or reading some significant phrase, or at the perceiving of an unexpected sound or sight. The idea of &quot;sudden insight&quot; has been hotly debated in the history of Zen. It became part of the Traditional Zen Narrative in the 8th century.

Chinul, a 12th-century Korean Seon master, emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood. The contemporary Korean Seon master Seongcheol opposed this, emphasizing &quot;sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation&quot;. But Jiyu-Kennett, a contemporary western teacher, warns that attaining kenshō does not mean that a person is free from morality, the laws of karma, or the consequences of ones actions. This warning is reflected in the Wild fox koan.

==Mushi-dokugo and mushi-dokkaku==
Kenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher, as in the case of mushi-dokugo or (mushi-)dokkaku, a self-awakened pratyeka-buddha.

Though the literal meaning is &quot;self-awakened&quot; or &quot;awakened on one&#x27;s own&quot;, the emphasis in Zen, when using these terms, lies in the ultimate reliance on one&#x27;s own insight, instead of the authority of a teacher:
==Similarities with other traditions==
While the Japanese term &quot;kenshō&quot; is generally used by practitioners of Zen Buddhism, the insight it refers to is not limited to Japanese Zen Buddhism, or even to Buddhism in general.

===Theravada===
The Theravada tradition, which is best known in the west through the modern Vipassana movement, discerns four stages of enlightenment, in which Nirvana is reached in four succeeding sudden steps of insight.

===Dzogchen===
An analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one&#x27;s nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections. Rigpa is the knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity, which cannot be found by searching nor identified. One &quot;knows&quot; that there is a primordial freedom from grasping his or her mind.

===Advaita Vedanta===
In Advaita Vedanta moksha is attained by jnana, insight-knowledge. In Shankara&#x27;s philosophical synthesis insight samadhi is used as a subsidiary to this goal. Swami Vivekananda emphasized the &quot;experience&quot; of nirvikalpa samadhi as a means to validate religious, transcendental knowledge.

<doc id="323202" wikidata="Q2022261" url="?curid=323202" title="Rio Tinto Alcan">
<text>Rio Tinto Alcan is a Canada-based mining company. Headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, it is a subsidiary of global mining conglomerate Rio Tinto. It was created on 15 November 2007 as the result of the merger between Rio Tinto&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary and Canadian company Alcan.

The company is the global leader of aluminium mining and production, above its one time parent Alcoa (from which it split in 1928), Rusal, and some Chinese public companies.

==History==
Founded in 1902 as the Canadian unit of Alcoa, it was spun off in 1928. R.E. Powell left Alcoa to become Vice President of the Aluminium Company of Canada (later Alcan) in Montreal, was President from 1937 to 1957 and was then Chancellor of McGill University from 1957 to 1964.

Alcan has gone through several name changes:

* Northern Aluminum Company Limited – 1902
* Aluminum Company of Canada Limited – 1925
* registers the name Alcan – 1945
* added French name Aluminium du Canada, Limitée – 1965
* introduce the use of the name Alcan Aluminium Limited in English and Alcan Aluminium Limitée 1966; later used as the official name of the parent company in 1987
* Alcan Inc. – 2001
* Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. – 2008 (&quot;current company name&quot;)
* In May 2015, the corporation announced that the name Alcan would gradually disappear to only keep Rio Tinto

In 2008 Alcan Inc was amalgamated with Rio Tinto Canada Holding Inc following Rio Tinto Canada Holding Inc&#x27;s acquisition of a majority of the share capital in Alcan Inc. Following the acquisition which was carried out by way of amalgamation Rio Tinto Canada Holding Inc was renamed Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.
From 1935 to 1945, the use of &quot;Aluminum&quot; in Alcan&#x27;s name was being disputed by Alcoa, but a decision by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals ended the legality of the company&#x27;s name.

Historically, Alcan was one of Canada&#x27;s most important and powerful companies, and was listed as the sixth largest in 1975.

In 1982 the company acquired the British Aluminium Company, renaming the operation British Alcan. In 1999, Alcan made a failed attempt to make a three-way merger between it and Algroup (Alusuisse Lonza Group) of Switzerland and Pechiney of France. The proposed merger was blocked by the European Commission due to fears of anti-competition. After the deal fell through, Alcan acquired Algroup in 2000. Then in 2003, Alcan acquired Pechiney, completing the original three-way merger plan of 1999.

In July 2007, Hindalco Industries announced it is buying the stake of Alcan in the Utkal Alumina Project in Orissa, India marking an exit of Alcan from the project.

On 20 January 2009 Rio Tinto Alcan announced plans to close the Beauharnois smelter and reduce output from the Vaudreuil refinery; both facilities are in Quebec. It is part of a larger plan to reduce aluminum output by a further 6% (following a cut of 5% in late 2008), while cutting 1,100 jobs worldwide. The company will also sell its half-interest in the Chinese Alcan Ningxia joint venture.

Rio Tinto sold assets from Alcan, including Alcan Packaging and Alcan Composites, in 2009, and Alcan Engineered Products in 2011. Alcan Packaging was acquired by Australian packaging giant Amcor. Alcan Composites was sold to the Swiss firm Schweiter Technologies and re-branded in 2010 to 3A Composites.

After the union&#x27;s contract expired on 31 December 2011 the company has locked out nearly 800 employees at its smelter plant in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec since midnight of the end of the year. The action was following nearly 3 months of unsuccessful bargaining and the further plant operations will be handled by the staff.

In 2015, Rio Tinto Alcan is scheduled to move its HQ from the Maison Alcan and relocate to the Deloitte Tower, which will be situated between Windsor Station and the Bell Centre.

==Product groups==

===Bauxite and alumina===
Alcan owns, operates or has an interest in six bauxite mines and deposits, five smelter-grade alumina refineries and six specialty alumina plants. Its Bauxite &amp; Alumina group refines bauxite ore into smelter-grade alumina for Alcan&#x27;s Primary Metal group and external customers and specialty-grade alumina for third parties. It also owns an extensive transportation network, including trucking, rail, marine shipping and port facilities worldwide. In September 2019, the firm&#x27;s aluminium was certified by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) to be responsibly produced.

===Primary metal===
Alcan Primary Metal group included Alcan&#x27;s aluminum smelting facilities and power generation installations, smelting technology and equipment sales, engineering services and aluminum trading operations, anode and cathode production facilities and aluminum fluoride plants.

Alcan owned or had an interest in 22 smelters in 11 countries and regions.

Alcan was based in Montreal, Quebec and had revenues of US$23.6 billion and 68,000 employees in 61 countries in 2007.

==Corporate governance==
As of 6 March 2007, members of the board of directors of Alcan were: 
*Roland Berger
*L. Denis Desautels
*Dick Evans
*Yves Fortier
*Jean-Paul Jacamon
*William R. Loomis Jr.
*Yves Mansion
*Christine Morin-Postel
*H. Onno Ruding
*Guy Saint-Pierre
*Gerhard Schulmeyer
*Paul M. Tellier
*Milton K. Wong

The last board of directors of Alcan prior to its renaming and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto PLC. Rio Tinto added several Alcan directors to its corporate board in London, including Dick Evans, who was Chief executive of Rio Tinto Alcan.

==Takeover==
Alcoa Inc. announced a hostile take over bid for its progeny on 7 May 2007, in a deal worth US$27 billion. The combined companies would have formed the largest aluminum producer in the world. On 22 May 2007, Alcan&#x27;s board of directors unanimously recommended that shareholders reject Alcoa&#x27;s unsolicited offer to acquire Alcan. The board determined that the offer was inadequate in multiple respects and was contrary to the best interests of Alcan&#x27;s shareholders. On 12 July 2007, Alcan announced a friendly takeover deal with Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, worth US$38.1 billion. Alcan&#x27;s board of directors unanimously recommended the deal to shareholders. Alcoa withdrew its bid later in the day. On 25 October 2007, the merger was completed and Rio Tinto Alcan (the amalgamation of Alcan and Rio Tinto Aluminum) became the world&#x27;s largest aluminum company. However, while Rio Tinto won overwhelming shareholder support on 25 October 2007, the acquisition was not formally consummated until 15 November 2007, the date on which the corporate name changed and integration was finally completed.

<doc id="323204" wikidata="Q1144935" url="?curid=323204" title="Curry powder">
<text>Curry powder is a spice mix originating from the Indian subcontinent, adapted from but not to be confused with the native spice mix of garam masala.

==History==
As commercially available in Western markets, curry powder is comparable to the traditional Indian spice mixture known as &quot;garam masala&quot;.

Conceived as a ready-made ingredient intended to replicate the flavor of an Indian sauce, it was first sold by Indian merchants to British traders. 

Curry powder was used as an ingredient in 18th-century British recipe books, and commercially available from the late 18th century, with brands such as Crosse &amp; Blackwell and Sharwood&#x27;s persisting to the present. In Australia, a common curry spice is Keen’s curry powder. The ingredient &quot;curry powder&quot;, along with instructions on how to produce it, are also seen in 19th-century US and Australian cookbooks, and advertisements. 

British traders introduced the powder to Meiji Japan, in the mid-19th century, where it became known as Japanese curry.

==Etymology==
In the West, the word &quot;curry&quot; is a broad reference to various Indian curries prepared with different combinations of spices in the Indian subcontinent. The sauce-like component characterized by &quot;curry&quot; has been derived from the Tamil word &quot;kaṟi&quot; meaning literally &#x27;sauce&#x27; or &#x27;relish for rice&#x27;, and finds synonyms with other regional references to local dishes evolving over thousands of years in the Indian subcontinent, such as &quot;jhol&quot;, &quot;shorba&quot; and &quot;kalia&quot;.

== Ingredients ==
A number of standards on curry powder have been defined. Most outline analytical requirements such as moisture, ash content, and oil content as well as permissible additives. Some also define a number of expected ingredients.

In the United States, curry powder is expected to contain at least these ingredients: turmeric, coriander, fenugreek, cinnamon, cumin, black pepper, ginger, and cardamom.

The 1999 East African Standard (EAS 98:1999) does not define an ingredient baseline. A newer 2017 draft from Uganda does require turmeric, coriander, cumin, fenugreek and mustard.

The Indian (FSSAI), Pakistani (PS:1741-1997), and international (ISO 2253:1999) standards do not define a baseline of essential ingredients.

==Nutritional information==

One tablespoon (6.3 g) of typical curry powder contains the following nutrients according to the USDA:
* Food energy: 
* Fat: 0.883 g
* Carbohydrates: 3.52 g
* Fibers: 3.35 g
* Protein: 0.9 g

<text>George &quot;Gogu&quot; Constantinescu (; last name also Constantinesco; 4 October 1881 – 11 December 1965) was a Romanian scientist, engineer, and inventor. During his career, he registered over 130 inventions. Constantinescu was the creator of the &quot;theory of sonics&quot;, a new branch of continuum mechanics, in which he described the transmission of mechanical energy through vibrations.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Born in Craiova in &quot;the Doctor&#x27;s House&quot; near the Mihai Bravu Gardens, Constantinescu was influenced by his father George, born in 1844 (a professor of mathematics and engineering science, specialized in mathematics at the Sorbonne University). Gogu Constantinescu settled in the United Kingdom in 1912. He was an honorary member of the Romanian Academy.

=== Family ===
He married Alexandra (Sandra) Cocorescu in Richmond, London, in December 1914. The couple moved to Wembley and, after their son Ian was born, they moved to Weybridge. The marriage broke down in the 1920s and ended in divorce. He then married Eva Litton and the couple moved to Oxen House, beside Lake Coniston. Eva had two children, Richard and Michael, by a previous marriage.

== Inventions and designs ==
=== Synchronization gear ===
His hydraulic machine gun synchronization gear allowed airplane-mounted guns to shoot between the spinning blades of the propeller. The Constantinesco synchronization gear (or &quot;&quot;CC&quot; gear&quot;) was first used operationally on the D.H.4s of No. 55 squadron R.F.C. from March 1917, during World War I, and rapidly became standard equipment, replacing a variety of mechanical gears. It continued to be used by the Royal Air Force until World War II – the Gloster Gladiator being the last British fighter to be equipped with &quot;CC&quot; gear.

=== Sonics ===
In 1918, he published the book &quot;A treatise on transmission of power by vibrations&quot; in which he described his theory of sonics. The theory is applicable to various systems of power transmission but has mostly been applied to hydraulic systems. Sonics differs from hydrostatics, being based on waves, rather than pressure, in the liquid. Constantinescu argued that, contrary to popular belief, liquids are compressible. Transmission of power by waves in a liquid (e.g. water or oil) required a generator to produce the waves and a motor to use the waves to do work, either by percussion (as in rock drills) or by conversion to rotary motion.

=== Internal combustion engines ===
He had several patents for improvements to carburetors, for example US1206512. He also devised a hydraulic system (patent GB133719) for operating both the valves and the fuel injectors for diesel engines.

=== Torque converter ===
He invented a mechanical torque converter actuated by a pendulum. This was applied to the &quot;Constantinesco&quot;, a French-manufactured car. It was also tried on rail vehicles. A 250 hp petrol engined locomotive with a Constantinescu torque converter was exhibited at the 1924 Wembley Exhibition. The system was not
adopted on British railways but it was applied to some railcars on the Romanian State Railways.

=== Other ===
Other inventions included a &quot;railway motor wagon&quot;. The latter ran on normal flanged steel wheels but the drive used a road vehicle powertrain with rubber tyres pressed against the rails. This is similar to the system used on many modern road-rail vehicles. He also designed the Grand Mosque of Constanța (a project completed by the architect Victor Ştefănescu, then known as the Carol I Mosque).

=== Recent developments ===
Research on a &quot;sonic asynchronous motor for vehicle applications&quot; (based on Constantinescu&#x27;s work) has been done at the Transilvania University of Brașov. The date of the paper is believed to be 5 October 2010.

== Death ==
He died at Oxen House, beside Coniston Water on 11/12 December 1965, and is buried in the churchyard at Lowick, Cumbria.

== Recognition ==
The Dimitrie Leonida Technical Museum in Bucharest has exhibits relating to George Constantinescu.

<doc id="323216" wikidata="Q1117673" url="?curid=323216" title="Thomas Pleasant Dockery">
<text>Brigadier-General Thomas Pleasant Dockery (December 18, 1833 – February 26, 1898) was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who served in both the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Thomas Pleasant Dockery was born in Montgomery County, North Carolina, to Colonel John Dockery, who had participated in the Indian removals in North Carolina. His father moved first to Hardeman County, Tennessee, and then to Columbia County, Arkansas, where he established a large plantation. John Dockery also played a role in establishing the first railroad in Arkansas.

==American Civil War==

At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Dockery received a commission on June 17, 1861, as captain of a Volunteer Militia Company in the 68th Regiment, Arkansas State Militia, Columbia County. This company became Company B of the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops, and Dockery was elected colonel of the new regiment. Dockery&#x27;s regiment was assigned to Nicholas Bartlett Pearce&#x27;s Division, Arkansas State Troops, and participated in the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek, August 10, 1861. Pearce&#x27;s Division of State Troops, voted to disband following the battle, rather than be transferred to Confederate Service.

Dockery then helped raise and was elected Colonel of the 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. After the Battle of Pea Ridge, most Confederate units were withdrawn from Arkansas to the east side of the Mississippi River. Dockery and his unit participated in the Second Battle of Corinth. Dockery commanded the 19th Arkansas Infantry in Martin E. Green&#x27;s 2nd Brigade in John S. Bowen&#x27;s Division during the Vicksburg campaign. The brigade was involved in heavy fighting at the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1, 1863, losing 222 casualties, and the Battle of Champion&#x27;s Hill on 16 May, losing 268 casualties. At the Battle of Big Black River Bridge on May 17, the brigade was overrun, losing one killed, nine wounded, and 1,012 captured. When Green was killed during the Siege of Vicksburg, Dockery assumed command of the brigade.

Dockery was captured when the city capitulated on July 4, 1864. After being paroled, Dockery was ordered by Confederate Secretary of War J.A. Seddon to assemble the Arkansas Confederate prisoners who had been released following the surrender of Vicksburg and Port Hudson at Washington, Arkansas, in the Trans-Mississippi Department. He was to reform them and recruit the units up to a full brigade.

On August 10, 1864, Dockery received his commission as a brigadier-general and raised an Arkansas brigade, which he led in the Red River Campaign and participated in the Battle of Mount Elba, Battle of Prairie D&#x27;Ane, Battle of Poison Spring Battle of Marks&#x27; Mills and the Battle of Jenkins&#x27; Ferry. During this campaign, Dockery commanded a brigade in Fagan&#x27;s cavalry division. The brigade consisted of the 18th Arkansas, 19th Arkansas, and 20th Arkansas Mounted Infantry Regiments, and the 12th Arkansas Infantry Battalion (mounted).

Late in 1864, Dockery was assigned to command the Reserve Forces of the State of Arkansas. In May 1865 Dockery signed the instrument of surrender which surrendered all remaining Confederate forces in Arkansas.

==Later life==
Dockery died on February 26, 1898, in New York City and was buried in Natchez&#x27;s city cemetery.

<text>East Texas Baptist University (ETBU) is a private Baptist university in Marshall, Texas, United States. It is affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas.

==History==
ETBU is located on the site of the former Van Zandt Farm at the highest altitude in Harrison County. ETBU was founded as the College of Marshall in 1912, after a campaign to create a Southern Baptist college in East Texas. The campus&#x27; first building, Marshall Hall, was completed in 1916. It was designed to house a gymnasium, library, chapel/theatre, administrative offices and classrooms. The College of Marshall opened the following year in 1917 as a two-year junior college and academy. The college was greatly enlarged during the tenure of President Frank Shelby Groner who served as president of the college from 1928 until 1942. It became East Texas Baptist College in 1944.

In June 2015, J. Blair Blackburn, a native of Minden, Louisiana, was inaugurated as the 13th president of East Texas Baptist University. He succeeded Samuel &quot;Dub&quot; Oliver, who became in 2014 the president of Union University in Jackson, Tennessee.

In 2015 the university applied for and received an exception to Title IX based on religious beliefs allowing it to discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.

In June of 2024 ETBU announced a merger with B.H. Carroll Theological Institute expanding the institution to a level VI institution of higher learning.
== Accreditation ==
ETBU is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. It also is accredited by The Board of Nurse Examiners for the State of Texas for Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), the Commissions of Collegiate Nursing Education, and the National Association of Schools of Music.

== Campus ==

=== Security ===
During the day, the campus is patrolled by the on-campus security officer. Security cameras record 24 hours a day and are monitored from 8:00 am – 10:00 pm. Call boxes are placed in strategic locations around campus. At night, the campus is monitored by private security officers (off-duty Marshall City Police Officers).

<text>A sun dog (or sundog) or mock sun, also called a parhelion (plural parhelia) in atmospheric science, is an atmospheric optical phenomenon that consists of a bright spot to one or both sides of the Sun. Two sun dogs often flank the Sun within a 22° halo.

The sun dog is a member of the family of halos caused by the refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere. Sun dogs typically appear as a pair of subtly colored patches of light, around 22° to the left and right of the Sun, and at the same altitude above the horizon as the Sun. They can be seen anywhere in the world during any season, but are not always obvious or bright. Sun dogs are best seen and most conspicuous when the Sun is near the horizon.

== Formation and characteristics ==

Sun dogs are commonly caused by the refraction and scattering of light from horizontally oriented plate-shaped hexagonal ice crystals either suspended in high and cold cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, or drifting in freezing moist air at low levels as diamond dust. The crystals act as prisms, bending the light rays passing through them with a minimum deflection of 22°. As the crystals gently float downwards with their large hexagonal faces almost horizontal, sunlight is refracted horizontally, and sun dogs are seen to the left and right of the Sun. Larger plates wobble more, and thus produce taller sun dogs.

Sun dogs are red-colored at the side nearest the Sun; farther out the colors grade through oranges to blue. The colors overlap considerably and are muted, never pure or saturated. The colors of the sun dog finally merge into the white of the parhelic circle (if the latter is visible).

The same plate-shaped ice crystals that cause sun dogs are also responsible for the colorful circumzenithal arc, meaning that these two types of halo tend to co-occur. The latter is often missed by viewers, since it is located more or less directly overhead. Another halo variety often seen together with sun dogs is the 22° halo, which forms a ring at roughly the same angular distance from the sun as the sun dogs, thus appearing to interconnect them. As the Sun rises higher, the rays passing through the plate crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane, causing their angle of deviation to increase and the sun dogs to move farther from the 22° halo, while staying at the same elevation.

It is possible to predict the forms of sun dogs as would be seen on other planets and moons. Mars might have sun dogs formed by both water-ice and CO2-ice. On the giant planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—other crystals form clouds of ammonia, methane, and other substances that can produce halos with four or more sun dogs.

A related phenomenon, the Crown flash is also known as a &quot;leaping Sundog&quot;.

== Terminology ==
A somewhat common misconception among the general public is to refer to any member of the ice halo family as a &quot;sun dog&quot; (especially the 22° halo, being one of the most common varieties). However, sun dogs represent just one of many different types of halos. For referring to the atmospheric phenomenon in general, the term &quot;(ice crystal) halo(s)&quot; is more appropriate.

== Etymology ==
The exact etymology of &quot;sun dog&quot; largely remains a mystery. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; says it is &quot;of obscure origin&quot;.

In Abram Palmer&#x27;s 1882 book &quot;Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy&quot;, sun-dogs are defined:

Other sources observe that &quot;Dog&quot; in English as a verb can mean &quot;hunt, track, or follow&quot;, so &quot;Dog the true [sun]&quot; has meant &quot;track the true [sun]&quot; since the 1510s.

Alternatively, Jonas Persson suggested that out of Norse mythology and archaic names — (sun dog), (sun dog), (sun wolf) — in the Scandinavian languages, constellations of two wolves hunting the Sun and the Moon, one after and one before, may be a possible origin for the term.

&quot;Parhelion&quot; (plural &quot;parhelia&quot;) comes from (, &#x27;beside the sun&#x27;; from (, &#x27;beside&#x27;) and (, &#x27;sun&#x27;)).

In the Anglo-Cornish dialect of Cornwall, United Kingdom, sun dogs are known as &quot;weather dogs&quot; (described as &quot;a short segment of a rainbow seen on the horizon, foreshowing foul weather&quot;). It is also known as &quot;a lagas in the sky&quot; which comes from the Cornish language term for the sun dog meaning &#x27;weather&#x27;s eye&#x27; (, &#x27;eye&#x27; and , &#x27;weather/wind&#x27;). This is in turn related to the Anglo-Cornish term &quot;cock&#x27;s eye&quot; for a halo round the Sun or the Moon, also a portent of bad weather.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

Aristotle (&quot;Meteorology&quot; III.2, 372a14) notes that &quot;two mock suns rose with the sun and followed it all through the day until sunset.&quot; He says that &quot;mock suns&quot; are always to the side, never above or below, most commonly at sunrise or sunset, more rarely in the middle of the day.

The poet Aratus (&quot;Phaenomena&quot;, lines 880–891) mentions parhelia as part of his catalogue of Weather Signs; according to him, they can indicate rain, wind, or an approaching storm.

Artemidorus in his &quot;Oneirocritica&quot; (&#x27;On the Interpretation of Dreams&#x27;) included the mock suns amongst a list of celestial deities.

A passage in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;On the Republic&quot; (54–51 BC) is one of many Roman authors who refer to sun dogs and similar phenomena:

Seneca makes an incidental reference to sun dogs in the first book of his &quot;Naturales Quaestiones&quot;.

Pliny the Elder references accounts of sun dogs in the 31st chapter of the 2nd book of his &quot;Historia Naturalis&quot;:

The 2nd-century Roman writer and philosopher Apuleius in his &quot;Apologia&quot; says &quot;What is the cause of the prismatic colours of the rainbow, or of the appearance in heaven of two rival images of the sun, with sundry other phenomena treated in a monumental volume by Archimedes of Syracuse.&quot;

Fulcher of Chartres, writing in Jerusalem in the early twelfth century, notes in his &quot;Historia Hierosolymitana&quot; (1127) that on February 23, 1106
===Wars of the Roses===

The prelude to the Battle of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross in Herefordshire, England in 1461 is supposed to have involved the appearance of a halo display with three &quot;suns&quot;. The Yorkist commander, later Edward IV of England, convinced his initially frightened troops that it represented the three sons of the Duke of York, and Edward&#x27;s troops won a decisive victory. The event was dramatized by William Shakespeare in &quot;King Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, and by Sharon Kay Penman in &quot;The Sunne In Splendour&quot;.

=== Early modern era ===

Another early clear description of sun dogs is by Jacob Hutter, who wrote in his &quot;Brotherly Faithfulness: Epistles from a Time of Persecution&quot;:

The observation most likely occurred in Auspitz (Hustopeče), Moravia on 31 October 1533. The original was written in German and is from a letter originally sent in November 1533 from Auspitz in Moravia to the Adige Valley in South Tyrol. The Kuntz Maurer and Michel Schuster mentioned in the letter left Hutter on the Thursday after the feast day of Simon and Jude, which is 28 October. The Thursday after was 30 October. It is likely that the &quot;two rainbows with their backs turned toward each other, almost touching&quot; involved two further halo phenomena, possibly a circumzenithal arc (prone to co-occur with sun dogs) together with a partial 46° halo or supralateral arc.

While mostly known and often quoted for being the oldest color depiction of the city of Stockholm, &quot;Vädersolstavlan&quot; (Swedish; &quot;The Sundog Painting&quot;, literally &quot;The Weather Sun Painting&quot;) is arguably also one of the oldest known depictions of a halo display, including a pair of sun dogs. For two hours in the morning of 20 April 1535, the skies over the city were filled with white circles and arcs crossing the sky, while additional suns (i.e., sun dogs) appeared around the sun. The phenomenon quickly resulted in rumours of an omen of God&#x27;s forthcoming revenge on King Gustav Vasa (1496–1560) for having introduced Protestantism during the 1520s and for being heavy-handed with his enemies allied with the Danish king.

Hoping to end speculations, the Chancellor Olaus Petri (1493–1552), a Lutheran scholar, ordered a painting to be produced documenting the event. When confronted with the painting, the King, however, interpreted it as a conspiracy — the real sun, of course, being himself —threatened by competing fake suns, one being Olaus Petri and the other the clergyman and scholar Laurentius Andreae (1470–1552). Both were thus accused of treachery, but eventually escaped capital punishment. The original painting is lost, but a copy from the 1630s survives and can still be seen in the church Storkyrkan in central Stockholm.

A series of complex parhelia displays in Rome in 1629, and again in 1630, were described by Christoph Scheiner in his book &quot;Parhelia&quot;, one of the earliest works on the subject. It had a profound effect, causing René Descartes to interrupt his metaphysical studies and led to his work of natural philosophy called &quot;The World&quot;.

On 20 February 1661 the people of Gdańsk witnessed a complex halo display, described by Georg Fehlau in a pamphlet, the &quot;Sevenfold Sun Miracle&quot;, and again the following year by Johannes Hevelius in his book, &quot;Mercurius in Sole visus Gedani&quot;.

On 18 June 1790 Johann Tobias Lowitz, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, observed a complex display of haloes and parhelia which included his Lowitz arcs.

=== Late modern era to current day ===

In 1843, winter in the British Colony of Newfoundland was referred to as the &#x27;Winter of Three Suns&#x27; and was unusually cold with 15 days of temperatures between 3–10 degrees below zero.

&quot;Part of the time we marched in the teeth of a biting storm of snow, and at every hour of the day the sun could be discerned sulking behind soft grey mists in company with rivals, known in the language of the plains as &#x27;Sun-dogs&#x27;, whose parahelic splendors warned the traveler of the approach of the ever-to-be-dreaded &#x27;blizzard&#x27;.&quot;

On 14 February 2020, the people of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region witnessed a different complex halo display called the Five-fold sun miracle, in which all five sun halos were linked to each other by rays, forming a circle among them.

<text>Toronto-Dominion Bank (), doing business as TD Bank Group (), is a Canadian multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. The bank was created on February 1, 1955, through the merger of the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank, which were founded in 1855 and 1869, respectively. It is one of two Big Five banks of Canada founded in Toronto, the other being the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

In 2021, according to Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, TD Bank Group was the largest bank in Canada by total assets and also by market capitalization, a top 10 bank in North America, and the 23rd largest bank in the world. In 2019, it was designated a global systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. In 2023, the company was ranked 43rd in the Forbes Global 2000. 

The bank and its subsidiaries have over 89,000 employees and over 26million clients worldwide. In Canada, the bank operates through its TD Canada Trust division and serves more than 11million customers at over 1,091 branches. In the United States, the company operates through their subsidiary TD Bank, N.A., which was created through the merger of TD Banknorth and Commerce Bank. TD Bank serves more than 6.5million customers in the United States with a network of over 1,200 branches in 16 states and the District of Columbia.

==History==
The predecessors of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, the Bank of Toronto, and the Dominion Bank were established in the mid-19th century, the former in 1855 and the latter in 1869. In 1954, an agreement was reached to merge the two financial institutions. The merger was later accepted by the Canadian minister of Finance on November 1, 1954, and was made official on February 1, 1955. The new institution adopted the name Toronto-Dominion Bank. The two banks were of similar size and had healthy balance sheets at the time of the merger. They were among Canada&#x27;s smaller banks; their desire merge was to compete with the larger banks. The combined Toronto-Dominion Bank became the fourth largest bank in Canada, with assets of $1.1 billion. 

In 1967, TD Bank opened its new head office, the Toronto-Dominion Centre in downtown Toronto. In the next year, the bank entered into a partnership with Chargex (later known as Visa Inc.). The TD Bank shield logo was unveiled to the public near the end of the decade, in 1969.

In 1976, TD Bank piloted its first automated teller machine (ATM), the TD 360, which was renamed the Green Machine, a name it continues to carry.

In 1987, Toronto Dominion Securities Inc. was established by the bank. TD Bank saw growth in the 1990s, with the acquisition of several financial assets including the commercial branches of Standard Chartered Bank of Canada. In 1992, the bank acquired the assets and branches of Central Guaranty Trust, as well as Waterhouse Investor Services in 1996.

In 1992, TD Bank and G4S Cash Solutions, a subsidiary of British security services company G4S plc, began a pilot project in Toronto that developed into a nationwide partnership in 1997. G4S Cash Solutions secured the contract to transport cash and provide first-line maintenance for the bank&#x27;s ATMs – both cash dispensing and deposit pick up units.&quot; By 2010, the partnership had expanded where G4S Cash Solutions operated 2,577 ATMs, 1,093 branch night deposits, 95 weekly balanced cash dispensers as well as eight cash dispensers for branch tellers and 100 across the pavement services and hosted a discussion on the introduction of polymer banknotes in 2011 with leading Canadian financial institutions.

TD Bank formed a partnership with Bank of Montreal (BMO) and Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) in 1996 to create Symcor, a private entity that offers transaction services such as item processing, statement processing and cash-management services to major banks and retail and telecommunications companies in Canada. In 2011, Symcor produces close to 675million statements and more than two billion pages of customer statements, and processes three billion cheques annually.

In 1998, TD Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce agreed to a merger. However, the Government of Canada, at the recommendation of then Minister of Finance Paul Martin, blocked the merger, as well as another proposed merger between the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada – believing it was not in the best interest of Canadians.

In 2000, Toronto-Dominion Securities bought Newcrest Capital for (75 per cent in stock and 25 per cent in cash). In the same year, TD Bank also acquired Canada Trust, re-branding most of its commercial banking operations in Canada as TD Canada Trust.

Ultimately Martin would approve the merger of TD and Canada Trust with some conditions. The new bank sold Canada Trust&#x27;s MasterCard business to meet the demands of the Competition Bureau due to the fact that TD issued Visa cards at the time and Canada Trust issued MasterCard and competition rules at the time prevented a single institution from the duality of selling both brands simultaneously. The Competition Bureau also forced the sale of 13 branches, representing over 120,000 customers, in three Ontario markets where the territories of TD and Canada Trust overlapped. The vast majority of the affected branches were in the Kitchener-Waterloo area, including four in Kitchener, two in Waterloo, four in Cambridge and one in Elmira. All but one branch were sold to the Bank of Montreal for $50million. The remaining branch in Paris, Ontario, was sold to Laurentian Bank of Canada. In all six TD branches and seven Canada Trust branches specifically changed hands to meet the Competition Bureau&#x27;s requirements.

In response, TD announced it would close 275 branches, representing 4,900 employees, to adhere to the ruling and to reduce overall costs. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said the Competition Bureau&#x27;s decision to ultimately approve the deal would reduce consumer choice while eliminating the chance to create a second-tier of Canadian banking by killing off the Trust industry in Canada.

===21st century===
In 2002, TD Bank acquired Stafford Trading and Letco Trading. In the following year, TD Bank acquired Laurentian Bank&#x27;s retail branches west of Quebec. 

In 2004, TD Bank entered the American retail banking market, announcing an agreement to acquire the majority stake of Banknorth, a New England–based bank, for a total of . Banknorth was later rebranded as TD Banknorth after the sale was finalized in March 2005.

In January 2006, the company sold its United States brokerage business branded as TD Waterhouse, which it had purchased in 1984, to Ameritrade. The business was renamed TD Ameritrade.

In April 2007, TD Bank acquired all remaining shares of TD Banknorth, transforming TD Banknorth into a fully owned subsidiary of TD Bank, and resulting in it being no longer traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In the same year, TD Bank acquired Commerce Bancorp, a bank based in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Commerce Bancorp was later merged with TD Banknorth to form TD Bank, N.A. in 2008.

In 2010, the bank acquired the Florida-based Riverside National Bank of Fort Pierce; and the South Financial Group Inc. In the following year, TD Bank acquired Chrysler Financial, which was later rebranded as TD Auto Finance. On December 1, 2011, TD Bank acquired MBNA&#x27;s Canadian credit card business. In October 2014, Affiliated Computer Services, a subsidiary of Xerox, acquired Symcor&#x27;s U.S. operations from TD Bank.

After Moody&#x27;s Investor Service downgraded the credit worthiness of Royal Bank of Canada to Aa1 on December 13, 2010, TD Bank remained the only one of Canada&#x27;s Big Five banks with a top Aaa credit rating at that point in the Great Recession (at the time, CIBC was Aa2, Scotiabank was Aa1 and Bank of Montreal was Aa2). It is also ranked number 1 by profit in the Top 1000 2012 listing.

From 2014 to 2015, TD went through a minor restructuring which included job cuts and other cost-cutting measures, under the leadership of Bharat Masrani, which kept the stock price on a stable upward trend.

In April 2020 it became apparent that TD Bank was a significant secured creditor involved in the voluntary administration of the Virgin Australia airline, which has debts of . The Virgin administrators declared TD Bank held an all present and after-acquired property charge over substantially the whole of the property of certain entities of the airline.

In March 2021, TD Bank agreed to buy Headlands Tech Global Markets LLC from Headlands Technologies to enhance its automated fixed income trading platform.

Bloomberg reported that TD Bank, along with Canada&#x27;s other large banks, added ESG measures to their chief executive officers&#x27; compensation plans.

On February 28, 2022, TD made a offer for First Horizon Corp., with 1,159 branches, expected to be completed in February 2023. This would be the second-largest bank deal since the Great Recession in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, TD had in U.S. assets, making it the ninth largest bank in the United States. If completed the deal would give TD 1,560 branches in 22 U.S. states. On May 4, 2023, it was announced that the deal would not proceed due to regulatory uncertainty.

In July 2022, TD Bank announced it was evaluating a takeover of US brokerage firm Cowen. The following month, TD agreed to buy Cowen for in an all-cash deal, paying Cowen shareholders per share. TD announced that Cowen chair and CEO Jeffrey Solomon would join the senior leadership of TD&#x27;s securities division following the acquisition, and that the combined business will be known as TD Cowen, headed by Solomon. To fund the purchase, TD sold over 28 million non-voting common shares of Charles Schwab Corporation, reducing its stake in the company from 13.4 percent to 12 percent.

In August 2023, TD Bank Group announced that it was expanding its share repurchase program. It planned to repurchase 90 million shares (about 4.9 percent of outstanding shares).

==Sponsorships==

Toronto-Dominion Bank, and its subsidiaries, are title sponsors for a number of sporting venues in Canada and the United States. TD Bank holds the naming rights to several multi-sport indoor arenas, including TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. TD Banknorth acquired the naming rights for the Boston-based venue in 2005, with the venue being known as TD Banknorth Garden until 2007. After TD Banknorth was merged to form TD Bank, N.A., the venue dropped Banknorth from the name and was branded as TD Garden. The Boston Celtics and Boston Bruins, which play at the venue, announced a 20-year extension of the TD Garden naming rights deal in January 2023. The deal extends to 2045.

Other indoor stadiums sponsored by TD Bank include TD Station in Saint John, New Brunswick; and TD Place Arena in Ottawa, Ontario. TD Place Arena forms a part of TD Place at Lansdowne Park. The bank also holds the naming rights to the outdoor stadium at TD Place, known as TD Place Stadium. Other outdoor stadiums sponsored by TD Bank include TD Stadium in London, Ontario, and TD Ballpark in Dunedin, Florida.

==Controversies==
In 2010, a suspicious customer trading at TD Bank in the UK was fined £750,000 (US$1.16 million) by the Financial Services Authority for intentionally mismarking his trading positions.

News outlets reported the bank&#x27;s policy regarding ordinary Iranian-Canadian citizens in July 2012. About 100 personal bank accounts had been closed, citing the recent ambiguous Special Economic Measure Regulation of the Canadian government. A family in Vancouver was forced to refinance a $250,000 house mortgage in 60 days to avoid foreclosure.

A TD Bank document became the focus of a 2012 contempt hearing in Miami federal court. In a civil lawsuit against TD Bank, a jury found the bank liable for aiding alleged Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein&#x27;s fraud.

In 2015, the Canadian news website the &quot;Halifax Examiner&quot; reported that a political action committee (PAC) established by TD Bank had donated over $50,000 to the campaigns of anti-LGBT rights politicians in the United States. The article suggested that this was problematic given TD Bank&#x27;s status as a sponsor of 41 LGBT Pride events across North America; TD Bank made no comment. In response to this article, on October 6, 2015, a motion was brought at the annual general meeting of Halifax Pride to sever ties with TD Bank if it did not provide a satisfactory response to the concerns; the motion was ultimately defeated.

On March 10, 2017, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (CBC) news programme &quot;Go Public&quot; reported that TD Bank employees had admitted that, under pressure to achieve sales targets, they had increased customers&#x27; lines of credit, overdraft amounts, and Visa credit limits without advising them which is against the law. One TD financial adviser says she &quot;invested clients&#x27; savings into funds which were not suitable, because of the SR [sales revenue] pressure&quot;. Another admitted downplaying the risk of products saying: &quot;I was forced to lie to customers, just to meet the sales revenue targets.&quot; In an internal letter to employees, Andy Pilkington, executive vice-president of branch banking, wrote: &quot;We don&#x27;t believe the [CBC] story is an accurate portrayal of our culture,&quot; but the report provided an opportunity &quot;to pause, reflect and ask ourselves ... how we can do better for our people and our customers.&quot; The bank&#x27;s stock lost 5.55 percent of its value on March 10, posting its worst day since 2009.

In 2017, Greenpeace announced a campaign against TD&#x27;s financing of tar sands on the basis of environmental as well as human rights issues. Their campaign stated that tar-sand pipelines are not consistent with a transition to a lower-carbon world and that many Indigenous and First Nations communities along the pipeline routes have not given permission for the projects.

Following his ended relationship to private-banking with JPMorgan, which was headed by his friend Jes Staley, and his relationships later for over 20 years through Thomas Bowers at the Citi Private Bank and subsequently the Thomas Bowers headed private wealth management division of Deutsche Bank from 2013 until early 2019, Jeffrey Epstein established a close relationship during 2019, allegedly through Darren Indyke, with wealth management and private banking at TD Bank which was Epstein&#x27;s bank while he was under investigations in the United States, Brazil, and France at the time of his death in August 2019.

In February 2022, TD Bank froze two personal bank accounts holding $1.1million in funds, deposited to support the vaccine mandate protests in Ottawa.

TD Bank has faced serious regulatory violations relating to money laundering. The bank has been heavily criticized for its role in the fentanyl and opioid epidemic in the United States, particularly in assistance provided by bank employees to drug traffickers. The allegations have prompted calls for CEO Bharat Masrani to step down, and has severely tarnished TD Bank&#x27;s reputation in the United States. The fines in the United States are expected to exceed , which would be the most a Canadian bank has ever been fined. The bank was also fined by FINTRAC, which is much more reluctant than the United States Department of Justice to penalize large institutions such as TD Bank because of the power and influence TD Bank has over Canadian politicians and government policy. The fine is the largest fine ever imposed by FINTRAC.

On October 10, 2024, it was revealed that TD was required to pay in fines due to charges that it failed to properly monitor money laundering by drug cartels, particularly by a Chinese organized crime ring based in Flushing, Queens. TD will pay to the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a record fine for a bank. TD must also pay to the US Justice Department. U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden requested that TD identify executives responsible for anti-money laundering compliance failures.

<doc id="323237" wikidata="Q1080670" url="?curid=323237" title="TD Canada Trust">
<text>TD Canada Trust, commonly shortened in marketing to simply TD, is the Canadian commercial banking division of the multinational TD Bank Group. It is the second-largest commercial bank in Canada by assets, behind only the Royal Bank of Canada. TD Canada Trust offers a range of financial services and products to more than 10 million Canadian customers through more than 1,100 branches and 2,600 ATMs.

In addition to the countrywide network of TD branches and ATMs in Canada, the bank has a network of mobile mortgage specialists, financial planners, private bankers, investment advisors, and portfolio managers.

The current TD Canada Trust division was formed after TD&#x27;s acquisition of Canada Trust in 2000; prior to this merger, the institution&#x27;s retail operations were branded TD Bank. All new and most existing accounts are officially issued by Toronto-Dominion Bank (institution number: 004), although Canada Trust (institution number: 509) remains a separate subsidiary entity, and it remains the issuer of accounts opened at that institution prior to the merger.

Since 2012, TD has been phasing out the &quot;Canada Trust&quot; part of its name from its logo online, in advertisements, and on stationery. 

==History==

The Bank of Toronto (founded in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (founded in 1869) merged on 1 February 1955 to form TD Bank. Canada Trust, founded in 1864 in London, Ontario as &quot;Huron and Erie Savings and Loan Society&quot;, was acquired by TD Bank in 2000, after which TD adopted the new brand name &quot;TD Bank Financial Group&quot;.

Canada Trust&#x27;s retail division was merged with TD&#x27;s existing retail banking operations over the course of 2000 and 2001 to form &quot;TD Canada Trust&quot;. Canada Trust&#x27;s president and CEO, W. Edmund Clark, was made president and COO of TD at the time of the merger, and became the president and CEO of TD Bank Financial Group in 2002.

As Canada Trust&#x27;s existing branches had often served areas already served by TD&#x27;s own retail banking branches prior to the acquisition, many branches from both institutions were closed or combined as a result of the merger.

==Operations==

In 2010, TD Canada Trust launched a mobile banking app for iOS, Android and BlackBerry platforms, allowing clients to perform many of the same transactions that are available through EasyWeb online banking.

In June 2012, TD Canada Trust introduced an enhanced Access Card with the new Visa Debit / Interac Flash access card which allows customers to use it via the phone or online and at international merchants through the Visa network.

=== Services ===
TD provides over 200 different languages on phone service for customers in Canada, including English, French, Mandarin and Cantonese. Five languages (English, French, Italian, Cantonese and Portuguese) are provided on ATMs.

==Controversy==
Toronto-Dominion Bank has come under fire due to a series of articles published by CBC News that question its banking practices. The first article written to the &quot;Go Public&quot; portion of the CBC Business section was posted on 10 March 2017, under the title &quot;&#x27;We do it because our jobs are at stake&#x27;: TD bank employees admit to breaking the law for fear of being fired&quot;.

On 15 March 2017, another article was released by CBC News that reported thousands of banking employees from the top-five banks in Canada (RBC, BMO, CIBC, TD and Scotiabank) being pressured to meet unreasonable sales targets.

TD has been accused of pinkwashing for using its prominent sponsorship of Pride Toronto as a demographic marketing tool, while locking trans women out of their accounts if they attempt to access telephone banking in what the bank identifies as a &quot;male voice&quot; and mislabels as fraud. There have also been multiple complaints that depositors who purchased RRSPs from pre-merger TD Bank or Canada Trust have lost access to these funds as TD Canada Trust claims to have no record of the deposits, the pretext being that the institution is only required to retain records for seven years. There have also been cases where the bank has absolved itself of responsibility for theft or fraudulent access to depositors accounts by third parties, blaming the depositor for fraud which is no fault of their own.

<doc id="323238" wikidata="Q1751768" url="?curid=323238" title="Paul de Lamerie">
<text>Paul Jacques de Lamerie (9 April 1688 – 1 August 1751) was a London-based silversmith. The Victoria and Albert Museum describes him as the &quot;greatest silversmith working in England in the 18th century&quot;. He was being referred to as the &quot;King&#x27;s silversmith&quot; in 1717. Though his mark raises the market value of silver, his output was large and not all his pieces are outstanding. The volume of work bearing de Lamerie&#x27;s mark makes it almost certain that he subcontracted orders to other London silversmiths before applying his own mark.

==Early and private life==
De Lamerie was born in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in the United Provinces (now the Netherlands). He was the son of a minor French nobleman, Paul Souchay de la Merie, a Huguenot who left France following the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. His father became an officer in the army of William III of Orange and moved to London in 1689 during the Glorious Revolution but died a pauper in 1735.

He married Louisa Juliott on 11 February 1717. They had two sons and four daughters together; three daughters survived.

Paul de Lamerie died in London and was buried at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Soho. There is a memorial plaque at the site of his workshop, 40 Gerrard Street, which was unveiled on 16 January 1992.

==Career==

In August 1703, de Lamerie became the apprentice to a London goldsmith of Huguenot origin, Pierre Platel (1659–1739). De Lamerie opened his own workshop in 1713 and was appointed goldsmith to George I in 1716. He worked in partnership with Ellis Gamble - formerly apprentice to Master William Hogarth - between 1723 and 1728. His early work is in the simple Queen Anne-styles, following classical French models, but de Lamerie is noted for his elaborate Rococo style of the 1730s, particularly the richly decorated works of an unidentified craftsman, the Maynard Master.

Leaving his first premises in Great Windmill Street he moved to 40 Gerrard Street in 1738. Here he lived and probably had his shop, his workshops being in one of the 48 properties he owned in the area.

His customers included Tsarinas Anna and Catherine, Count Aleksey Bobrinsky, Sir Robert Walpole, the Earl of Ilchester, the Earl of Thanet, Viscount Tyrconnel, the Duke of Bedford, and other members of the English aristocracy. He also worked for King John V of Portugal before losing favour to the Germains of Paris. One of his productions to the Portuguese Court was a huge solid silver bathtub lost in the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

He served on Goldsmiths&#x27; Company committees although never became Prime Warden. He also served as Captain and then Major in the Westminster Volunteers.

The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford has the Treby toilet service (29 pieces, London, 1724–1725).

A two-handled silver cup and cover by Paul de Lamerie, dated 1720, was among the wedding gifts of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Lawsuit==
Famously, in 1722 a chimney sweep&#x27;s boy sued de Lamerie after he found a jewel and took it to de Lamerie&#x27;s shop to have it valued. When the boy asked for the jewel back, de Lamerie&#x27;s apprentice only returned the socket of the jewel and not the stones. The King&#x27;s Bench held that even though the boy did not have absolute ownership of the jewel, the boy had the right to keep it against all but the rightful owner. De Lamerie was ordered to return the jewel or pay the boy its value. His name was misspelled by the court reporter.

<text>Benito Juárez is one of the eleven municipalities of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Most of its population reside in the municipal seat, Cancún. It is named after the 19th century president and statesman Benito Juárez.

== Geography ==
Benito Juárez is located in the north of the state with the Caribbean Sea as its eastern border. It borders on the municipalities of Isla Mujeres to the north, Puerto Morelos to the south, and Lázaro Cárdenas to the west. The municipality covers an area which is 3.72% of the territory of the state.

===Communities===

Puerto Juárez, the primary location of the original population of the area before the founding of the city of Cancún, was considered a separate location from 1960 until 1990, when it was abolished as such and incorporated as one of Cancún&#x27;s districts.

==History==
The Mayan culture occupied the territory and they are still subsisting. In Cancún are different types of archeological monuments like &quot;Ruinas de el Rey&quot;. At the time the town of Cancún was founded (1902) the majority of its business activity was the production and export gum and &quot;palo de tinte&quot;. They transported it to Puerto Morelos for the translation to Cozumel and from there it was exported to other countries.

After World War II gum production dropped. In the 1960s, other commercial activities were started. In the 1960s the &quot;island of Cancún&quot; was only occupied at certain times of the year, however by 1974 the first hotel was opened in what is now known as the Hotel Zone. This was also the year Quintana Roo that was recognized as a state. At the time Benito Juarez was founded, it was part the Isla Mujeres territory and received municipality status one year later in 1975.

In 2016, the municipality of Puerto Morelos was split off from Benito Juárez.
