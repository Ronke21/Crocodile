<text>Maple Ridge is a city in British Columbia, Canada. It is located in the northeastern section of Greater Vancouver between the Fraser River and the Golden Ears, which is a group of mountain summits which are the southernmost of the Garibaldi Ranges of the Coast Mountains. Maple Ridge&#x27;s population in 2021 was 90,990. Its downtown core area was once known as Haney.

== History ==
Maple Ridge was incorporated as a district municipality on September 12, 1874. It covered an area of yet was home to only approximately 50 families. Maple Ridge is British Columbia&#x27;s fifth-oldest municipality (after New Westminster, Victoria, Langley, and Chilliwack). From the creation of British Columbia&#x27;s regional districts in 1965 until the expansion of Metro Vancouver in 1995, it was part of the now-defunct Dewdney-Alouette Regional District with the City of Pitt Meadows and District of Mission and other north-side communities east to Chehalis. Maple Ridge has been part of Metro Vancouver since 1995.

On March 26, 2014, Maple Ridge residents voted to change the community&#x27;s status from district municipality to city. Subsequently, Maple Ridge Council submitted its request for status change to the Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development. The status change became official on September 12, 2014, which coincided with Maple Ridge&#x27;s 140th anniversary of municipal incorporation.

<text>is a city located in southern Gifu Prefecture in Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 148,225, and a population density of 1700 persons per km2, in 59,736 households. The total area of the city was .

Situated in the northern part of the Nōbi Plain, what is now Kakamigahara originally thrived as a post station on the Nakasendō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto, being called &quot;Unuma-juku&quot; at the time. In more recent history, the city developed due to the JASDF Gifu base. In addition, Kakamigahara grew as an industrial city and a commuter suburb of Gifu City and Nagoya.

The city of Kakamigahara has many large parks, the most notable among them being &quot;Kakamigahara Kōen&quot;, which was originally made from a vacant lot owned by Gifu University. A city planning policy of making Kakamigahara into a &quot;park city&quot; has been undertaken by the municipality, and in 2005, the city received the Green City Prize from the prime minister. Although the city was officially named Kakamigahara, it is also called Kakamihara, Kagamihara, or Kagamigahara by tradition.

==Geography==

Mountainous terrain runs from the northern to the eastern part of the city. The Kiso River flows through the southern part, forming the municipal and prefectural (Aichi-Gifu) border. A large portion of the city is situated on the Kakamigahara Plateau. Because the soil is very well drained, it was not traditionally suited to rice cultivation. With the exception of rest stops such as Unuma-juku or other roadside settlements, though, the area was largely wilderness until the Meiji period. The names of the Meitetsu train stations, Rokken, Nijukken, and the Ogase Reservoir are from that era. Beginning from the Meiji period, to take advantage of the large amount of wilderness and well-drained soil, military bases and training grounds were established. In addition, Gifu University&#x27;s agricultural and engineering departments were established in the area, leading the growth of machine and textile factories. These industries, in addition to carrot production, which used the dry soil, became the main industries of the town. Part of the city is within the borders of the Hida-Kisogawa Quasi-National Park.

==History==
The area around Kakamigahara was part of traditional Mino Province. During the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, the area was organised into Inaba District, Gifu in April 1897.

1 April 1963: Kakamigahara City was founded by amalgamating Naka, Sohara, Unuma, and Inaba.

1968: The Line Bridge was completed. Together with the Inuyama bridge, completed in 1925, these two bridges span the Kiso River and connect Kakamigahara City with Aichi Prefecture.

1969: The Aigi bridge was completed. This was the third bridge to span the Kiso, and connects the city to Aichi Prefecture. It was the first bridge to connect Kakamigahara to Konan City.

5 March 1986: The section of the Tokai-Hokoriku Expressway between Kakamigahara Junction and Mino Junction was opened. Furthermore, on 13 December 1998, the Tokai-Hokoriku Expressway was connected to the Meishin Expressway (Ichinomiya Junction).

28 March 2000: The twinning of the Inuyama Bridge was completed. Previously, Meitetsu trains had shared the bridge with automobiles, crossing the bridge in a manner similar to streetcars. After the twinning, the trains began to use the old Inuyama Bridge. This separation of trains and automobiles improved transportation across the river.

1 November 2004: Kawashima-cho (Hashima District), was incorporated in Kakamigahara City.

5 November 2006: The Shin-mei Ko-ami Bridge, connecting to Konan, is completed.

24 March 2013: Kakamigahara Bridge is completed. It connects the city hall area with Kawashima-chiku (formerly Kawashima-cho) of Konan City. With the completion of this bridge, there are now four routes from Kakamigahara City into Aichi Prefecture.

<doc id="328962" wikidata="Q1543315" url="?curid=328962" title="Suicide Commando">
<text>Suicide Commando is a Belgian electro-industrial music act formed by Johan Van Roy in 1986. For live shows, it consists of Van Roy himself on vocals, Torben Schmidt on keyboards, and Mario Vaerewijck on drums.

== History ==
Van Roy began experimenting with electronic music back in 1986. Two years later, he released his first tape under the moniker Suicide Commando, and his track appeared on the vinyl compilation &quot;Electronic&quot;. He continued to release more tapes until he was signed by the rising German label Off Beat. Van Roy&#x27;s first album, &quot;Critical Stage,&quot; was released in 1994. The following year, he released a second album, &quot;Stored Images&quot;, which contains one of his most popular songs, &quot;See You in Hell&quot;. In 1996, he released the compilation album &quot;Contamination&quot; for the act&#x27;s tenth anniversary.

In 1998, Suicide Commando released the album &quot;Construct-Destruct&quot; and its sister release, &quot;Reconstruction&quot;, which included the new club hits &quot;Desire&quot; and &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;.

Van Roy was one of the founders of the Dependent label in 1999. It was on this new label that Suicide Commando&#x27;s next releases, the singles &quot;Hellraiser&quot; and &quot;Comatose Delusion&quot; and the EP &quot;Love Breeds Suicide&quot;, accompanied Suicide Commando&#x27;s 2000 release, &quot;Mindstrip&quot;. &quot;Mindstrip&quot; reached number one on the German alternative chart (DAC). It was licensed and released in North America by Metropolis Records. In 2002, Suicide Commando released the DCD &quot;Anthology&quot; on Dependent, a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, which included the band&#x27;s biggest hits &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, &quot;See You in Hell&quot;, &quot;Love Breeds Suicide&quot;, and offered some exclusive new remixes and rare versions.

Suicide Commando&#x27;s next release, &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, was voted album of the year (2003) by the Deutsche Alternative Charts (DAC). In 2006, Suicide Commando returned with the album &quot;Bind, Torture, Kill&quot;, which was preceded by the single &quot;Godsend + Menschenfresser&quot;. &quot;Godsend + Menschenfresser&quot; peaked at #2 on the DAC Singles charts while the album reached the top position in the DAC, ranked #8 on the DAC Top Albums of 2006, and was voted album of the month in the German Orkus magazine.

Released in 2007, one year after the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary, was the &quot;X20&quot; boxset including 3 CDs (one remix CD, one &quot;best of&quot; CD and the &quot;Fuck You Bitch&quot; EP) and Suicide Commando&#x27;s very first live DVD. In 2009, Suicide Commando signed a deal with the German Out of Line label. The first release on Out of Line was the 7&quot; &quot;severed head/until we die&quot;, not much later followed by a new EP called &quot;die motherfucker die&quot; which once again reached the top position in the German alternative chart. In 2010, Suicide Commando released the &quot;implements of hell&quot; album on Out of Line in three different editions and once again licensed in the US by Metropolis Records.

In 2011, Suicide Commando re-released their first three studio albums as &quot;The Suicide Sessions&quot;, a special limited six-CD box including remastered versions of his first three albums &quot;Critical Stage&quot;, &quot;Stored Images&quot;, and &quot;Construct-Destruct&quot;, and three discs with much bonus material and many previously unreleased songs. One year later, van Roy returned with &quot;Attention Whore&quot;, as the lead single from the album &quot;When Evil Speaks&quot;, which was released in 2013 and reached the official German Media Control Charts at position 47. At the end of 2013, &quot;Unterwelt&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;When Evil Speaks&quot;.

In 2015, Suicide Commando returned with &quot;The Pain That You Like&quot; (featuring Jean Luc de Meyer from Front 242 as a guest vocalist) as the lead single from the album &quot;Forest of the Impaled&quot; (2017). The album reached the official German Media Control Charts at position 28.

<doc id="328965" wikidata="Q5098512" url="?curid=328965" title="Children of the Atom">
<text>Children of the Atom is a 1953 science fiction novel by American writer Wilmar H. Shiras, which has been listed as one of &quot;The Most Significant SF &amp; Fantasy Books of the Last 50 Years, 1953–2002.&quot; The book is a collection and expansion of three earlier stories, the most famous of which is the novella &quot;In Hiding&quot; from 1948, which appeared on several &quot;Best SF&quot; lists. The book&#x27;s plot focuses on children with superhuman intelligence.

==Plot summary==
In the novel, much of which was originally published as a series of stories in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, hidden throughout a future America of 1972 are a group of incredibly gifted children — all approximately the same age, all preternaturally intelligent, and all hiding their incredible abilities from a world they know will not understand them.

These children were born to workers caught in an explosion at an atomic weapons facility, and orphaned just a few months after birth when their parents succumbed to delayed effects from the blast.

The children in the novel are mutants, brought together to explore their unique abilities and study in secret at an exclusive school for gifted children, lest they be hated and feared by a world that would not understand them. The &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; described it in 1953 as &quot;the inevitable adjustments and maladjustments of minority genius to majority mediocrity&quot;.

In Shiras&#x27; book, none of the children are given paranormal super powers such as telekinesis or precognition—their primary difference is simply that of incredible intellect, combined with an energy and inquisitiveness that causes them to figuratively devour every book in their local libraries, to speed through university extension courses, and to publish countless articles and stories all over the world, but all done carefully through pen-names and mail-order, to disguise their youth, and protect them from the prejudicial stereotypes that less intelligent adults continue to try and enforce on children.

==Analysis==
The book was hailed as another step in science fiction&#x27;s coming of age, as it focused more in intellectual analysis and less on gadget-driven &quot;space opera&quot;

One reviewer wrote, &quot;What we find here is an inventive updating of Stapledon&#x27;s famous &quot;Odd John&quot; (1935) in very sensitive, unsentimental terms, with the addition of a sense of community, a benefit that Stapledon&#x27;s protagonist never got to fully experience. Shiras tells her story in simple yet affecting prose, a kind of blend of Sturgeon and Simak.&quot;

The story, about the incompatibility between the superman and normal humans, strikes a chord with many children, who feel &quot;different from the common herd, neglected, ridiculed, ignored, only to triumph when allied with others of our kind.&quot;

Groff Conklin praised the novel for its &quot;richness of character development.&quot; Boucher and McComas, however, were disappointed by it, saying that while the stories it was based on were first-rate, the novel-length expansion had become &quot;talkative, oversimplified, lacking in suspense or conflict, and, in short, just not adding up to an adequate novelistic treatment of a splendidly stated theme.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller, despite acknowledging that the expansion was less effective than the original work, still concluded that it was &quot;representative of the kind of thing science fiction does well.&quot;

<text>Christian democracy is an ideology inspired by Christian social teaching to respond to the challenges of contemporary society and politics.

Christian democracy has drawn mainly from Catholic social teaching and neo-scholasticism, as well as the Neo-Calvinist tradition within Christianity; it later gained ground with Lutherans and Pentecostals, among other denominational traditions of Christianity in various parts of the world. During the nineteenth century, its principal concerns were to reconcile Catholicism with democracy, to answer the &quot;social question&quot; surrounding capitalism and the working class, and to resolve the tensions between church and state. In the twentieth century, Christian democrats led postwar Western and Southern Europe in building modern welfare states and constructing the European Union. Furthermore; in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, Christian democracy has gained support in Eastern Europe among former communist states suffering from corruption and stagnation.

On the European left-right political spectrum, Christian democracy has been difficult to pinpoint, as Christian democrats have often rejected liberal economics and individualism and advocated state intervention, while simultaneously defending private property rights against excessive state intervention. This has meant that Christian democracy has historically been considered centre-left on economics and centre-right on many social and moral issues. More recently, Christian democrats have positioned themselves as the centre-right; as with both the European People&#x27;s Party and European Christian Political Movement, with which many Christian democratic parties in Europe are affiliated. Christian democrats support a &quot;slightly regulated market economy&quot;, featuring an effective social security system, thus a social market economy.

Worldwide, many Christian democratic parties are members of the Centrist Democrat International. Examples of major Christian democratic parties include the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, the Dutch Christian Democratic Appeal, The Centre in Switzerland, the Spanish People&#x27;s Party, the Mexican National Action Party, the Austrian People&#x27;s Party, and the Christian Democratic Party of Chile. Many Christian democratic parties in the Americas are affiliated with the Christian Democrat Organization of America.

Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, although it is also present in other parts of the world.

==Overview of political viewpoints==
As a generalization, it can be said that Christian democratic parties in Europe tend to be moderately conservative and, in several cases, form the main conservative party in their respective countries (e.g., in Germany, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland), such as the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland, the Christian Social Party, the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland and the Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland. By contrast, Christian democratic parties in Latin America tend to vary in their position on the political spectrum depending on the country they are in, being either more left-leaning, as in the case of the Christian Democratic Party in Chile, or more right-leaning, as in the case of the National Action Party in Mexico. Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood have noted that &quot;Christian democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles.&quot;

Christian democrats are usually socially conservative and generally have a relatively skeptical stance towards abortion and same-sex marriage, although some Christian democratic parties have accepted the limited legalization of both. They advocate for a consistent life ethic concerning their opposition to capital punishment and assisted suicide. Christian democrats have also supported the prohibition of drugs. Christian democratic parties are often likely to assert their country&#x27;s Christian heritage and explicitly affirm Christian ethics rather than adopting a more liberal or secular stance; at the same time, Christian democratic parties enshrine confessional liberty. Christian democracy fosters an &quot;ecumenical unity achieved on the religious level against the atheism of the government in the Communist countries.&quot;

Christian democrats&#x27; views include traditional moral values (on marriage, abortion, prohibition of drugs, etc.), opposition to secularization, opposition to state atheism, a view of the evolutionary (as opposed to revolutionary) development of society, an emphasis on law and order, and a rejection of communism. Christian democrats are open to change (for example, in the structure of society) and not necessarily supportive of the social status quo, and have an emphasis on human rights and individual initiative. A rejection of secularism and an emphasis on the fact that the individual is part of a community and has duties towards it. Christian democrats hold that the various sectors of society (such as education, family, economy, and state) have autonomy and responsibility over their sphere, a concept known as sphere sovereignty. One sphere ought not to dictate the obligations of another social entity; for example, the sphere of the state is not permitted to interfere with raising children, a role that belongs to the sphere of the family. Within the sphere of government, Christian democrats maintain that civil issues should first be addressed at the lowest level of government before being examined at a higher level, a doctrine known as subsidiarity. These concepts of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity are considered cornerstones of Christian democracy political ideology.

Christian democrats emphasize community, social justice, and solidarity, alongside supporting a welfare state, labor unions, and support for regulation of market forces. Most European Christian democrats reject the concept of class struggle and instead prefer co-determination, while US Christian democrats support a distributist economic system containing widespread distribution of productive property, in particular increased worker ownership (workplace democracy) and management (workers&#x27; self-management) of their production.

The Christian democratic welfare state aims at supporting families and often relies on intermediary institutions to deliver social services and social insurance, often with the support of the state.

Christian democrats support the principle of stewardship, which upholds the idea that humans should safeguard the planet for future generations of life. Christian democrats also tend to have a conciliatory view concerning immigration.

== Political philosophy ==
No single author has been recognized by all Christian democrats as the leading Christian democratic thinker, but Jacques Maritain comes closest. Thus, in terms of impact, he is in no way akin to what John Locke is for liberalism, Edmund Burke for conservatism, or Karl Marx for socialism. Other authors critical to forming Christian democratic ideology include Pope Leo XIII, Pope Pius XI, Emmanuel Mounier, Heinrich Pesch, Abraham Kuyper, and Luigi Sturzo.

=== General inspiration ===

==== Neo-scholasticism ====
Christian democracy can trace its philosophical roots to Thomas Aquinas and his thoughts on Aristotelian ontology and the Christian tradition. According to Aquinas, human rights are based on natural law and are defined as the things humans need to function correctly. For example, food is a human right because, without food, humans cannot function properly. Aquinas affirmed that humans are images of the divine, which follows human dignity and equality; all humans are equal because they all share that nature. Aquinas also affirmed the natural reality of family and household, based on the lifelong commitment of husband and wife, perfected with children, a unit that has priority over other communities. Aquinas also argued that public power could legitimately appropriate private owners of their resources for the common good when used for people in genuine need. When Leo XIII became pope, he issued the Papal Encyclical Aeterni Patris, which rehabilitated scholastic philosophy. The pope highlighted Aquinas&#x27;s views on liberty, authority, laws, justice, and charity in this encyclical.

Aquinas&#x27;s ideas would later be the foundation for the idea of subsidiarity, alongside the ideas that the state is to serve the people and that there is universal solidarity amongst humanity. A significant Neo-Scholastic was Jacques Maritain, who attempted to reconcile democracy and human rights with Thomist natural law. Maritain argued that human rights are based on natural law and that democracy needs Christianity to succeed. Jacques Maritain would use Thomist ideas of property to reduce inequality, arguing that the state should be involved if individuals do not use their property correctly. Jacques Maritain and Emmanuel Mounier would also use Thomist thinking in developing their idea of personalism.

==== Neo-Calvinism ====
Another intellectual element of Christian democracy was neo-Calvinism. The neo-Calvinist political ideas relied on John Calvin&#x27;s ideas of the sovereignty of God and common grace. God&#x27;s sovereignty was particularly useful in light of the French revolution and notions of individual and state sovereignty. It was the basis of sphere sovereignty, which helped the interests of Reformed Christians, which have historically been a minority. In sphere sovereignty, each sphere has its activity area related to God. Within this view of sphere sovereignty, it was the state&#x27;s role to pursue public justice. Another element was that life is religious, and politics should reflect this.

==== Orthodoxy ====
The development of Orthodox Christian democracy has been held back by the fact that Orthodox Politics has not received church support in the way that &quot;Rerum Novarum&quot; encouraged Christian democracy, or how early Christian democrats such as Luigi Sturzo received tacit consent for his political activities. Russian Christian democrats, for example, have had to develop a doctrine of democracy.

=== Political thought ===
Academics have noted a few ideas key to Christian democracy, including personalism, solidarity (or some variant of social capitalism), popularism (or some variant of its catch-all nature), notions of &quot;pluralism&quot; (which in a vertical sense relates to subsidiarity, and in a horizontal sense denotes sphere sovereignty) and stewardship.

==== Personalism ====
Personalism is a political doctrine generally linked to Emmanuel Mounier. It focuses on the person, their intellect, responsibilities, and value. It stresses that humans are free beings with dignity and political rights, but these rights must be used for the common good. It also stresses that true human freedom is used in line with God&#x27;s will. It is against the individualist and collectivist notions of humanity. It also stresses that people become full when they are members of their communities. In practical policy, it leads to a few conclusions:

* Human life is sacred and is an end in itself. It is, therefore, against abortion and euthanasia.
* The family unit is an essential part of society and must be defended.
* Traditional gender roles must be respected; this leads to a rejection of same-sex marriages.
* Freedom is not a license for Moral permissiveness.

Personalism has generally been the underlying basis in Christian democracy that leads to human rights, especially in relation to a right to life, a right to family and a right to aid, a right to suffrage, freedom of conscience, and freedom of religion.

Modern personalist views also are inspired by ecologist values. Rowan Williams contrasts personalism, which he describes as a relation between humans and God, to modern-day capitalism, which is focused only on endless economic growth, which is harmful to the natural environment.

==== Solidarity and social capitalism ====
The Christian democratic political economy has not tethered itself to one &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism and socialism, but rather various ways between capitalism and socialism. Over time, Christian democrats moved from solidarism to a social market economy.

Initially, many Catholic political movements in the 19th century opposed capitalism and socialism equally, as both were based on materialism and social conflict. Initially, the system that Catholics advocated was one of corporatism, based on bringing back a guild-organized economy. The idea was a society where individuals were organized by their economic position. In these corporatist systems, the fathers were the head of families. One of these conceptions was that of Franz von Baader, who advocated for proletariat enfranchisement in the corporatist system. Baader is recognized as the first person to advocate for workplace codetermination. Codetermination would become a key point of unity amongst the Christian democratic trade unions. In the 19th century and early 20th century, the Lutheran social Christians advocated an authoritarian view of corporatism, and the Neo-Calvinist corporatist idea has been credited as an inspiration for the polder system that currently exists in the Netherlands. Many of these corporatisms would advance the idea of replacing the elected parliament with corporative parliament recognizing the various corporate estates of the nation; industrialists, small businesses, peasants, landowners, workers, etc. The papal encyclical &quot;Rerum Novarum&quot; would recognize some of the principles behind corporatism.

The Christian democratic notion of corporatism was found within Heinrich Pesch&#x27;s solidarism. Pesch&#x27;s solidarism argued for international solidarity based on shared humanity, national solidarity based on shared nationality, familiar solidarity for family members, and class and cross-class solidarity based on shared interests in the workplace. This latter solidarity focused on occupational associations advancing collective interests, codetermination, and a &quot;third house of parliament&quot; that would advise on economic matters. Heinrich Pesch&#x27;s idea of corporatism would be a qualified notion of subsidiarity. Pesch&#x27;s ideas would be influential in the Papal Encyclical &quot;Quadragesimo Anno&quot;, given that Pesch&#x27;s disciple Oswald von Nell-Breuning would draft the document. &quot;Quadragesimo Anno&quot; was significant in legitimatizing the push for a corporatist system and subjected it to the notion of subsidiarity. Around this time, corporatism became increasingly prominent among young Catholics frustrated with parliamentary politics and, in many instances, would inspire authoritarian and fascist regimes movements in Austria, France, Spain, Portugal, and Germany. Eventually, corporatism fell out of the political debate due to this association with authoritarian and fascist regimes.

Another economic idea within Christian democracy is the social market economy, which is widely influential across much of continental Europe. The social market is an essentially free market economy based on a free price system and private property. However, it supports government activity to promote competitive markets with a comprehensive social welfare system and effective public services to address social inequalities resulting from free market outcomes. The market is seen not as an end but as a means of generating wealth to achieve broader social goals and maintain societal cohesion. The basis of the social market economy is ordoliberalism, or German neoliberalism, an idea related to thinkers such as Walter Eucken, Franz Böhm, Ludwig Erhard, Wilhelm Röpke and Alfred Müller-Armack. Ordoliberals viewed the concentration of power as a significant danger to liberty. They desired an economic constitution that would ensure competition in markets and free decisions, where people are uninfluenced by the government. As a result of the economic constitution, this model is mildly corporatist. This model of capitalism, sometimes called Rhine–Alpine capitalism or &quot;social capitalism&quot;, is contrasted with Anglo-American capitalism or &quot;enterprise capitalism&quot;. Whereas the Anglo-capitalist model aims to remove restrictions on capitalism and enable individual prosperity, the Rhinish Model embeds the market into the social framework, with the goals of nation-building and of taking care of citizens.

Beginning in the 1980s, European Christian democratic parties have partially adopted &quot;neo-liberal&quot; policies. However, Christian democrats in the American Solidarity Party instead adopted distributism. The promotion of the Christian democratic concepts of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity led to the creation of corporatist welfare states throughout the world that continue to exist to this day. In keeping with the Christian democratic concepts of the cultural mandate and the preferential option for the poor, Christian justice is viewed as demanding that the welfare of all people, especially the poor and vulnerable, must be protected because every human being has dignity, being made in the image of God. In many countries, Christian democrats organized labor unions that competed with communist and social democratic unions, in contrast to conservatism&#x27;s stance against worker organizations. In solidarity with these labor unions, in Belgium, for example, Christian democrats have lobbied for Sunday blue laws that guarantee workers and civil servants a day of rest in line with historic Christian Sabbath principles. Another example of a Christian-inspired workers&#x27; movement is the Catholic Worker Movement established by Dorothy Day, which not only fought for better working standards, but also contributed to promoting the idea of pacifism and a just war.

==== Popularism ====
&quot;Popolarismo&quot; (or popularism) is a political doctrine conceived by Don Luigi Sturzo, however in reality this was Christian democracy in the political sphere. The papal encyclical &quot;Graves de communi re&quot; prohibited Christian democracy to be a political ideology, and so Sturzo used the term &quot;popularism&quot; instead. Popularism helped European Catholics come to accept democracy, and so the idea has been linked to Christian democratic ideas of democracy, which Sturzo Defined as:

Academics have tied the idea of popularism to the way Christian democratic parties encompass sections of the whole population. This results from the inherent religious center allowing cut across class divisions. In realization of this, Christian democratic parties tend to invoke the title &quot;People&#x27;s Parties&quot;. Academic Carlo Invernizzi Accetti links the idea of popularism to proportional representation, pillarization, and consociational democracy.

==== Pluralism ====
The Christian democratic notion of pluralism is about how humans are generally embedded in a social framework. John Witte, explaining the origin of Christian democracy, describes pluralism thus:

Sphere sovereignty stresses the horizontal element; social communities have roles they must uphold and certain liberty and autonomy. Here the government had the role of policing the spheres. Subsidiarity is the vertical element, where the state has the role of protecting and regulating the spheres. The state must not interfere if these communities are behaving effectively. This also means that a state can intervene when these communities are not competent. In practice, subsidiarity has been used to justify the creation of international organizations, as higher international authorities need to exist to police nation-states.

==== Stewardship ====
The idea of stewardship has traditionally been linked to managerial skills regarding property and income; Stewardship can be found in neo-Calvinist Abraham Kuyper&#x27;s works, where it relates to a person&#x27;s responsibilities over what is entrusted to them, especially their property. In Social Catholic circles in the 1970s, stewardship was explicitly linked to environmental matters. Stewardship was found in the first programs of the Christian Democratic Appeal, and from here alongside the works of American bishops, the idea would spread to other Christian democratic parties. They view competent and efficient government as emblematic of a &quot;just steward&quot;, which includes just stewardship over environmental matters. Pope Francis took a firm stance on environmentalism in the papal encyclical Laudato Si in 2015. Here, the idea of stewardship comes from the correct translation of Genesis, where God entrusts man with stewardship of the earth.

==History==
===19th century===

The origins of Christian democracy go back to the French Revolution, where initially, French republicanism and the Catholic Church were deeply hostile to one another as the revolutionary governments had attacked the church, confiscated the church&#x27;s lands, persecuted its priests, and attempted to establish new religions, first the Cult of Reason and then the Cult of the Supreme Being. After the decades following the French Revolution, the Catholic Church saw the rise of liberalism as a threat to Catholic values. The rise of capitalism and the resulting industrialization and urbanization of society were seen to be destroying traditional communal and family life. According to the Catholic Church, liberal economics promoted selfishness and materialism with the liberal emphasis on individualism, tolerance, and free expression, enabling all kinds of self-indulgence and permissiveness to thrive. Consequently, for much of the 19th century, the Catholic Church was hostile to democracy and liberalism.

This hostility to democracy and liberalism would be challenged by liberal Catholics who believed the alliance between the church and aristocracy was a barrier to the church&#x27;s mission. Initially, this group desired to reconcile the Catholics with the state of modern politics, getting Catholics involved in parties, public action, and parliamentarianism. This, however, was not an endorsement of democracy, and the liberal Catholics maintained they did not adhere to liberalism. Eventually, the movement&#x27;s leading figures, such as Félicité de La Mennais, would become more accepting of democracy. The group came to be associated with a desire for a free press, freedom of association and worship, and free education.

Around this time, Catholic social thought developed, with social Catholic theologians and activists advocating the interests of workers in society. Some activists, such as Frédéric Ozanam, the Society of St Vincent de Paul founder, were more amenable to liberal democracy. Ozanam criticized economic liberalism and the commodification of labor and argued that charity was insufficient to deal with these problems and that labor associations and state intervention were needed. Italian Popular Party leader Luigi Sturzo credits Ozanam as the first Christian democrat. One of the more influential theologians in Germany was Wilhelm von Ketteler, who encouraged Catholics to accept the modern state. Ketteler argued for productive associations with profit sharing, Christian trade unions, and general workers&#x27; rights.

In the 1870s, Catholic political movements arose independently of the Catholic Church to defend Catholic interests from the liberal states. In Europe, generally, the liberal states desired to wrestle control over the Catholic education system; however, in Germany and Italy, this was a direct attack against the church. The Catholic political movements specifically opposed liberal secularism and state control of education; the parties that came out of these movements include the Centre Party (Germany), the Catholic Party (Belgium), various Catholic parties in the Netherlands, and the Christian Social Party (Austria). Initially, most of these parties accepted the anti-liberal beliefs of the Catholic Church at the time; many Catholics behind these movements believed all spheres of life should be regulated by religion. These movements were initially built by ultramontanes, were against the liberal view that church and state must be separated, and used the term &quot;Christian democracy&quot; in opposition to liberal democracy. The Centre Party in Germany seems to be an exception to this trend in that they defended the Catholic Church through an appeal to liberal freedoms and democracy. Additionally, the Centre Party, inspired by Ketteler, supported social legislation.

Despite the thoroughly pro-Catholic position of these movements, the church itself resisted the movements, seeing them as a challenge to the church&#x27;s control of the laity. Over time, the impact of electoral politics on these parties pushed them to be more accepting of liberal democracy. To form effective political coalitions, these parties evolved from Catholic parties to parties inspired by Christianity and turned to voters, not the Catholic Church, for legitimacy. During this time, the Catholic parties took an inter-class nature, such that they comprised trade unionists, landlords, industrialists, peasants, and artisans, which academics have linked to the notion of popularism.

Protestant confessional politics was more wide and varied. The most significant movement was in the Netherlands, where Reformed, neo-Calvinist Protestants founded the Anti-Revolutionary Party. Similarly to the Catholics, this party was formed out of similar concerns with liberal control of education. The party was against the ideas of the French revolution, and its founder, Abraham Kuyper, held that the government derived its authority from God, not from the people. However, Kuyper and the Anti-Revolutionary Party did support organic democratic representation and promoted universal household suffrage. In Germany, this element came from the Lutheran Adolf Stoecker, who established the Christian Social Party, and those who followed him. The Christian social movement aimed to challenge Marxist socialism, so Stoecker supported pro-worker economic policies to win over the working class. However, when this failed, Stoecker turned to anti-Semitism. In Switzerland, Stoecker and his fellow allies generated some interest in Protestant political organization, but Protestants largely accepted the predominance of liberalism, so there was only minor growth of a Protestant political movement.

=== Between &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; and World War II ===
The papacy of Pope Leo XIII was a turning point in the development of Christian democracy, and he attempted to infuse democracy and liberalism with Catholic values. In the papal encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; in 1891, Pope Leo XIII recognized workers&#x27; misery and argued for means to improve workers&#x27; conditions. He also attacked economic liberalism and condemned the rise of socialism, and generally encouraged a corporatist approach to labor relations. &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; would provide Catholic labor movements with an intellectual platform and would coincide with the rise of Christian trade unions across Europe. It was the catalyst for the beginning of Christian democracy in France, Italy, and Austria. The same year as the release of Rerum Novarum, Abraham Kuyper organized the Christian Social Congress alongside the Protestant workers&#x27; movement, where Kuyper outlined their social principles and policy. These actions reinforced the push for Christian social action in the Netherlands. In &quot;Graves de communi re&quot;, the pope would protest against using Christian democracy as a political label, preferring it to describe a social movement.

Some academics consider the Catholic political parties around this time to be essentially Catholic and not Christian democratic. However, others consider the new Italian People&#x27;s Party and the Popular Democratic Party (France) Christian democratic. These parties advocated political liberties, religious liberties, economic reform, and social partnership, policies to support democracy and internationalism. The Italian People&#x27;s Party also advocated for regionalism and proportional representation. At the beginning of the Weimar Republic, Adam Stegerwald attempted to reform the Centre Party into a Christian democratic party, uniting Catholics and Protestants. In Belgium, the rising workers&#x27; movement came to form the increasingly powerful Christian democratic faction of the Catholic Party. This period also saw other Catholic parties forming; Bavarian Catholics broke away and formed the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party due to the Centre Party&#x27;s participation in establishing the Weimar Republic. In Switzerland, Catholics formed the Swiss Conservative People&#x27;s Party, which, as a party, was divided between three competing demographics; rural Catholics who wanted greater regional independence, Catholic workers who wanted economic reform, and the more conservative groups who opposed democracy. Overall, the party was held together by the Catholic faith and anti-socialist and anti-liberal tendencies. In Ireland, Fianna Fáil was founded as a Catholic political party. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, and Labor would all be avenues for Christian democracy in the post-war period.

In the early 20th century, Protestant confessional politics developed further. In Weimar Germany, Stoecker&#x27;s Christian social party joined the German National People&#x27;s Party as its labor wing in 1918. The Christian social parliamentarians from this party would then leave in 1929 to form the Christian Social People&#x27;s Service (CSVD). Protestant workers&#x27; movements in Switzerland gradually developed mutual aid funds into an independent trade union movement. Around this time, Swiss Protestants formed the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party. The 1930s saw the rise of the Christian People&#x27;s Party in Norway. It was built on the work of Pietist Lutherans, and the party was initially founded to defend the country&#x27;s Christian heritage against the rise of secularization. There was cooperation between the Protestant and Catholic parties during this period. The Catholic and Protestant parties would form joint governments in the Netherlands and Germany. However, this cooperation did not challenge the underlying differences between the movements; in Germany, there was tension from cooperation with Protestants, while in the Netherlands, the Anti-Revolutionaries would not support pro-Vatican policies.

A significant factor that helped Christian democracy during this period was the lay Catholic Action movements. These organizations stress the apostolate of the laity, which is the role of everyday Catholics in spreading the faith. In practice, these movements helped support the Christian trade unions and Christian democratic parties across Europe. In Italy, Catholic Action supported the Italian Popular Party, and the rise of Mussolini would act as an anti-fascist force.&#x27; Catholic Action would later help the post-war Christian democracy.&#x27; Likewise, Catholic Action would work in the resistance in France and help found the MRP.&quot;&quot;

In 1931, Pope Pius XI released the encyclical &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot;, which was released on the 40th anniversary of &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, and aimed to clarify the subsequent social doctrine of the church. The encyclical doubled down on the pronouncements of &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; on economic liberalism and socialism. The attack against socialism was broadened to include moderate socialism, and within the encyclical, the pope outlined a corporatist structure of society based on the notion of &quot;subsidiarity&quot;. However, the pope would stress the autonomy of this corporatist system to distinguish it from fascism. This Quadragesimo Anno would come to influence the economic programs of Catholic parties of the time, such as the Popular Democratic Party, and the Dutch Roman Catholic State Party, alongside influencing Belgian Catholics. The Centre Party, Christian Social Party, and Swiss Conservative People&#x27;s Party already advocated corporatism based on economists such as Heinrich Pesch, Oswald von Nell-Breuning, and Karl von Vogelsang. In Germany and Austria, &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; renewed the vigor for corporatism. In Ireland, Political Catholics would pursue a policy of vocationalism taken directly from &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot;. This vocationalism was most evident in the corporatist nature of the Irish upper house.&quot;&quot;

Across Europe, the Catholic and Protestant parties faced the threat of fascism. Amidst the rise of Fascism in Italy, the Italian People&#x27;s Party, under Sturzo, attempted to challenge Mussolini by forming a coalition with the socialist party. Sturzo was ordered by the Catholic Church in 1923 to disband his party and exit politics. Poor electoral performance in 1924 would make Sturzo give party leadership to Alcide De Gasperi and go into exile. Once in power, the fascists disbanded the Italian People&#x27;s Party. This would precede the signing of the Lateran Treaty between the Catholic Church and the Italian fascists in 1929. The Centre Party and the CSVD would face the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany. Once the Nazis attained power in 1933, they attempted to take total power with the Enabling Act. Internally, the Centre Party was divided on the Enabling Act, but many became persuaded that Hitler would not eliminate the Reichstag. Comparatively, the historical anti-Semitism of the Protestant Christian Social movement left the Christian Socials susceptible to Nazism. The Nazi Party would infiltrate the Protestant unions linked to CSVD in 1931. Eventually, both parties would sign the Enabling Act, and both parties would summarily dissolve. In Austria, the Christian Socials would have already disbanded before Germany annexed Austria. In Austria, a short civil war between authoritarians and social democrats would divide the Christian Socials, many of which would help build the authoritarian state. Outside of Italy, Germany and, Austria, many Catholic and Protestant parties would ultimately be dissolved when Nazi Germany invaded the rest of Europe in World War II. Many Christian democrats would assist in the resistance in France.

=== The post-war period ===
After World War II, &quot;both Protestant and Catholic political activists helped to restore democracy to war-torn Europe and extend it overseas&quot;. Christian resistors were significant in establishing post-war Christian democracy movements in France, Germany, and Italy. The collapse of fascism led to the discrediting of the radical right. In Germany, conservatism was associated with reactionary and anti-democratic attitudes. The Christian democrats could claim to be untainted by fascism and thereby draw together conservative Catholics and bourgeois Protestants. In both Germany and Italy, the Christian democratic parties encompassed former conservatives. The Christian democratic parties dominated the post-war scene. In Italy, the new Christian Democratic Party led the coalition government under Alcide De Gasperi, and in France, the Popular Republican Movement became the largest party in parliament in 1946. In Germany, France, and Italy, the Christian democratic parties helped establish their respective countries&#x27; constitutions. Between the 1940s and 1990s, Christian democratic parties were in power across western Europe; &quot;In Germany they were in power for 36 years out of 50, in Italy for 47 years out of 52, in Belgium 47 years out of 53, and in Netherlands for 49 years of 53; even in France they were influential up to 1962&quot;.

In the post-war period, Christian democratic parties became more conservative, partially in response to communism and secularism. The Christian democrats also won the women&#x27;s vote in their respective countries due to the pro-family policies of Christian democrats. Christian democrats pursued decentralization policies during this time, encouraging regionalism in Germany, Italy, and Belgium. This was sought with increased favor as a result of experiencing fascism. Christian democratic parties were also crucial in pushing for codeterminative works councils and workers on boards during this time. Despite this initial power, cracks started to appear; Christian democracy in France declined substantially, as Popular Republican Movement and its successors quickly fell apart. French Christian democrats would ultimately become subsumed into Gaullist parties.

Similarly, minor Christian democratic parties such as the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) would rise in post-Franco Spain. However, these movements were too divided and lacked the political necessity of religious cleavages to play a dominant role in Spanish democracy. These Christian democratic parties would fail, and the Christian democrats would join the Spanish Popular Party.

Protestant Christian democracy developed in multifaceted ways in the post-war period. In Germany, it arose amongst the Lutheran ordoliberals. These Lutherans looked to Christian theologians such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer to path a way that obeyed worldly authority but also challenged the Nazi regime. The core of the ordoliberal ideology was a strong state that enabled market competition. During the war, the ordoliberals worked with Bonhoeffer to develop a political and socio-economic plan for the post-war period, and after the war, they joined with Catholics to form the Christian Democratic Union. The ordoliberals termed their vision a &quot;social market economy&quot;, a vision the Catholics would also come to champion. In Sweden, it arose amongst the Pentecostals, where it coalesced in the Christian Democrats, founded in 1964 as a reaction to secularization. The Finnish Christian Democrats, formed in 1957, and the Danish Christian People&#x27;s Party, formed in 1970, defended Christian schooling and dissented against secular trends such as atheism and liberal abortion policies. The Nordic Christian democratic parties did not represent the Lutheran state church but non-conformist Christians and lay activists within the Lutheran state church. In the Netherlands, the Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party and Christian Historical Union joined the Catholic People&#x27;s Party to form Christian Democratic Appeal.

European Christian democrats were a significant force in the creation of the European Union. At the beginning of the European project, three significant men were Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman, and Alcide De Gasperi, all Christian democrats. When the Rome Treaty was signed, Christian democrats were the leading governments in four of the six countries, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and were a part of the coalition government in the Netherlands at the time. At least until the mid-1980s, social democrats were hostile to the institutions of the European Communities – even in the 1970s, Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme called the European Commission &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;capitalist&quot;, &quot;clerical&quot;, and &quot;colonialist&quot;. Indeed, the European Union has the ideas of subsidiarity and personalism embedded within it. The influence of Christian democracy on the European Union is such that one academic has called the European Union a &quot;Christian democracy&quot;. Alongside the European Union was the development of European Christian democratic parties. This appeared in the 1940s with the Nouvelles Equipes Internationales, which would evolve into the European Union of Christian Democrats in 1965, and, finally, the European People&#x27;s Party in 1976.

=== 21st century ===
Christian democratic parties no longer have as much power in European politics. Indeed, in Italy, the Christian democratic party collapsed. The reasons for the decline in Christian democracy are multifaceted, partly due to European secularization and the loss of a voting base. The death of communism and the rise of neo-liberalism have also dented the movement, and the financial crisis has also shown flaws in Christian democratic welfare. Furthermore, immigration and the rise of populism have further put pressure on Christian democracy, as it is torn between the right&#x27;s call for restrictions, the businesses&#x27; call for an open labor market, and the religious call for more charity to immigrants.

Some Christian democratic parties, particularly in Europe, no longer emphasize religion and have become much more secular in recent years. Recently, many minor Christian democratic parties, such as the Christian Union, and others across Europe, did not feel represented in the existing political establishment, so they formed a political organization in the European Christian Political Movement. These parties stressed the Christian history of Europe alongside advocating for traditional Christian values and economic and environmental justice.

Many Muslim parties in Muslim countries have looked to the Christian democratic tradition for inspiration. The most notable is Turkey&#x27;s ruling Justice and Development Party (usually known by the Turkish acronym AKP, for &quot;Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi&quot;), which is Islamic and has moved towards the tradition. However, this link is questioned, given that AKP&#x27;s movement toward Christian democracy may be to curry the favor of European parties in European integration, something the European Christian democrats ultimately shot down. Other Islamic groups that have been linked include the Democratic League of Kosovo and Mohammad Morsi in Egypt. Some Muslim democratic parties embraced by Christian democrats are the National Awakening Party (Indonesia) and the Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats (Philippines), who have joined the Centrist Democrat International.

==Outside Western Europe==

The international organization of Christian democratic parties, the Centrist Democrat International (CDI), formerly known as the Christian Democratic International, is the second-largest international political organization in the world, after the Socialist International. European Christian democratic parties have a regional organization, the European People&#x27;s Party, which forms the largest group in the European Parliament: the European People&#x27;s Party Group.

===Latin America===
Early Christian democracy in Latin America formed in the early 20th century, and these parties were generally conservative, and their main aim was to protect the interests of the Catholic church. These parties viewed Christianity as the origin and soul of democratic values and advocated an organic conception of society, decentralization, and corporatism. Christian democrats would become more progressive in the 1960s and 1970s, partially due to the consequences of the Second Vatican Council between 1961 and 1963. This led to the growth of liberation theology in Latin American Catholicism, which stressed class conflict over the Christian democratic class mediation. Furthermore, due to the US policy against socialism in Latin America, Christian democratic parties could position themselves as progressive and demand social reforms.

Furthermore, Christian democrats accepted modernism and technocracy and began to advocate centralized planning. In the 1980s, due to international trends such as the Washington consensus, Christian democrats accepted neoliberal policies in their nations, leading to future electoral losses. Throughout this period, Christian democratic parties have played a force for democracy, such as COPEI, which helped establish Democratic Venezuela, and the PDC in Chile, the main opposition to Pinochet.

Christian democracy has been especially important in Chile &quot;(see Christian Democratic Party of Chile)&quot; and Venezuela (see COPEI Christian Democratic Party of Venezuela), among others, and partly also in Mexico, starting with the ascendancy of President Vicente Fox in 2000, followed by Felipe Calderón &quot;(see National Action Party (Mexico))&quot;. Cuba counts several Christian democratic political associations on the island and in exile. Perhaps the most significant is Movimiento Cristiano de Liberación (MCL), led by Cuban dissident Oswaldo Payá, who was killed in a tragic automobile accident in the summer of 2012 and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In Uruguay, the Christian Democratic Party of Uruguay, although numerically small, was instrumental in creating the leftist Broad Front in 1971.

===Central and Eastern Europe===

==== Poland ====
Christian democratic movements in Poland formed in 1890 and gained increasing prominence from 1916, such that various Christian democratic movements coalesced into the Christian Democratic Party in 1919. The party&#x27;s economic program drew from &quot;Rerum Novarum&quot; and later &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot;. The party would encourage cross-class solidarity, co-ownership, and co-determination. For the first half of the 1920s, the party had considerable influence in government, providing cabinet members and a prime minister. After the coup d&#x27;état in 1926, the party&#x27;s influence worsened. The party would eventually side with the opposition centre-left and unite with National Workers&#x27; Party to form the Labour Party in 1937. Wojciech Korfanty, Karol Popiel and Józef Haller were the most significant members of the Christian democratic movement.

During World War II many politicians of the Labour Party organised a resistance movement known as , which was later integrated with Home Army in 1942. The Labour Party continued to exist in exile till the fall of communism (its prominent member Stanisław Gebhart was active in organising the European and international Christian democratic movement), procommunist faction existed in Poland until 1950.

After World War II, the agrarian Polish People&#x27;s Party, the only opposition party in communist Poland had large Christian democratic factions, which had lost their influence after the party was defeated and forced to unite with communist peasant parties. Progovernmental organizations referring to Christian values, like PAX association represented interests of the communist block rather than Christian democratic values.

The Christian democratic movement experienced a revival during the Solidarity uprising. Lech Wałęsa and Tadeusz Mazowiecki were considered as Christian democratic leaders within the Solidarity movement. The democratic opposition was openly supported by the Catholic Church led by John Paul II, but also by Christian organisations like the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia. After the fall of communism, many Christian democratic parties were emerged on the right (like Centre Agreement, Christian-Peasant Party, Conservative People&#x27;s Party or the revived Labour Party), while more centre-oriented Christian factions teamed up with liberals to form the Democratic Union, later the Freedom Union. In the late 1990s, conservative and Christian democratic parties formed Solidarity Electoral Action.

Since 2005, the Polish political scene has been dominated by two major parties, liberal conservative Civic Platform and right-wing Law and Justice, both with significant Christian democratic factions. With the Civic Platform shifting over time to social-liberal positions and Law and Justice towards right-wing populism, the agrarian Polish People&#x27;s Party became a significant Christian-oriented voice. The Polish People&#x27;s Party has abandoned its former left-wing policy to form Christian democratic and conservative political projects like Polish Coalition and Third Way.

==== Romania ====
Christian democracy has developed in countries with Eastern Orthodox majorities in unique and disparate ways. Romania has seen small Christian parties – such as the National Peasants&#x27; Party in 1926, which promoted Christian morality, democracy and social justice. In the 1980s, Corneliu Coposu, would affiliate the party with the CDI, and on the fall of Communism, would re-enroll the party as the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party in 1990. This new party advocated market economies with social protection, subsidiarity and citizens liberties. Corneliu Coposu, hoped Romania would become &quot;the Capital of Orthodox Christian-Democracy&quot;.

After the fall of communism Christian democratic tendencies are mostly visible in the platform of the centre-right National Liberal Party and the eurofederalist, national conservative People&#x27;s Movement Party.

==== Russia ====
Russian Christian democracy was beset by personality clashes between leaders, and Russian Christian democracy was bifurcated into two ideological camps. The first wanted to import a carbon copy of Western Christian democracy into the Russian political scene, such as the RCDU, CDUR and RCPD. The Christians that make up these groups are not from Orthodoxy themselves – they are newly Orthodox Christians or Protestants. The largest party of the other group was the Russian Christian Democratic Movement, which attempted to unify democracy with orthodoxy on the basis of statism and patriotism (73–74). In practice they acted as democrats or patriots, depending on circumstances. It would gradually move to the right, adopt and ally with orthodox-monarchists and national-republicans. The party would eventually leave the democratic group.

==== Post-Iron Curtain and former Yugoslavia ====
After the end of the socialist experience in Central and Eastern Europe, and especially with European integration, many parties from former socialist countries become members of the Christian democratic umbrella organization, the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). Examples include the KDU-ČSL in the Czech Republic, the Croatian Democratic Union in Croatia, the Civic Platform in Poland, etc. Hungary&#x27;s Fidesz was part of the EPP from 2004 to 2021; its leader, Viktor Orbán, claimed Hungary to be a &quot;Christian democracy&quot;. Many of those parties pushed for a re-traditionalization of society, pro-family policies, a Bismarckian welfare state, and identity politics based on Christianity while maintaining a pro-European integration attitude. The ideals of Christian democracy also inspire other Euroskeptic parties, and they are grouped under the umbrella of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party; an example is Law and Justice in Poland.

=== Greece ===
In Greece, New Democracy is deemed to be a Christian democratic party – though it often moves back and forth from Christian democracy to liberal conservatism intermittently.

=== Britain ===
Christian democracy in the UK was sporadic and un-unified. One group was the Catholic Social Guild, established in 1909 to propagate a Catholic alternative to socialism. They encouraged Catholics to work within the Labour Party and push policies for families, a living wage, social partnership in industry, and property diffusion. Another group was the People and Freedom Group, established during Sturzo&#x27;s exile in the UK. They were a largely middle-class organization set up in response to pain felt by Catholics during the Spanish Civil War. They published their manifesto, &quot;For Democracy&quot; in 1939. The Catholic Worker was another Christian democratic group at the time. In general, British Christian democrats, especially those in the People and Freedom Group, attempted to push the Labour Party towards Christian democracy, and they made a significant attempt to portray Christian democracy as left-wing. Ultimately the People and Freedom Group failed to do so and became disillusioned with the Labour Party. On the other hand, the Catholic Worker aimed to make Labour policies acceptable to Catholics. More recently, Christian Peoples Alliance is a Christian democratic party that emphasizes the country&#x27;s Christian heritage and advocates for the principles of &quot;active compassion, respect for life, social justice, wise stewardship, empowerment, and reconciliation.&quot;

===Australia===
Christian democratic parties in Australia include the Democratic Labor Party and, arguably, the disbanded Christian Democratic Party.

The Democratic Labor Party was formed in 1955 as a split from the Australian Labor Party (ALP). In Victoria and New South Wales, state executive members, parliamentarians, and branch members associated with the Industrial Groups or B. A. Santamaria and &quot;The Movement&quot; (and therefore strongly identified with Roman Catholicism) were expelled from the party. They formed the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). Later in 1957, a similar split occurred in Queensland, with the resulting group joining the DLP. The party also had sitting members from Tasmania and New South Wales at various times, though it was much stronger in the states mentioned above. The Democratic Labor Party (DLP) did not claim to be a Christian democratic party, but it has been considered such by historian Michael Fogarty. The party&#x27;s goals were anti-communism, the decentralization of industry, population, administration, and ownership. In its view that the ALP was filled with communists, the party decided it would prefer the ruling conservative Liberal and Country parties over the ALP. However, it was more morally conservative, militantly anti-communist, and socially compassionate than the Liberals. The DLP heavily lost ground in the federal election of 1974, which saw its primary vote cut by nearly two-thirds and the election of an ALP government.

The DLP never regained its previous support in subsequent elections and formally disbanded in 1978, but a small group within the party refused to accept this decision and created a small, reformed successor party (now the Democratic Labour Party). In 2006, the new DLP experienced a resurgence. The successor party struggled through decades of Victorian elections before finally gaining a parliamentary seat when the Victorian upper house was redesigned. Nevertheless, its electoral support is still minimal in Victoria (around 2%). It has recently reformed state parties in Queensland and New South Wales. In the 2010 Australian federal election, the DLP won the sixth senate seat in Victoria, giving it representation in the Australian Senate.

The former Christian Democratic Party, initially known as the &quot;Call to Australia (Fred Nile) Group&quot;, was a strongly religious conservative party in Australia. It is a Christian right party, akin to the Canadian Christian Heritage Party and New Zealand Christian Heritage Party. In 2011, the Victorian and Western Australian branches of the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) voted to form a new party, Australian Christians, while the former Christian Democratic Party was wound up due to governance issues in 2022, and its leader, Fred Nile, moved onto a new party: &quot;Christ in Government (Fred Nile Alliance)&quot;.

===North America===
Historically, there has been no major Christian democratic movement in the United States. This is potentially a result of the two-party system in the US. However, for European Christian democrats, the United States has been a source of inspiration for how Christianity and democracy can work together. Indeed, for Jacques Maritain, America was the realization of the Christian democratic ideal. Thus, Invernizzi Accetti opined that &quot;from the point of view of Christian Democrats themselves, the United States didn&#x27;t need a Christian Democratic party or movement because it already was a Christian Democracy.&quot; However, there have been some Christian democratic Groups in the US; inspired by the &quot;People and Freedom Group&quot; in the United Kingdom, US Catholics set up similar groups in American cities. The American Solidarity Party is a minor third party in the United States that identifies as a Christian democratic party. Based in the United States, the Center for Public Justice is a Christian democratic public policy organization that desires to &quot;bring the principles of a Christian worldview to bear on the political realm.&quot;

The platform of the Christian Heritage Party of Canada, which was founded by Catholic politicians Bill and Heather Stilwell, as well as Reformed politicians Ed and Audrey Vanwoudenberg, resonates with Christian democratic political ideology. 

Asia

South Korea

Although Christian democratic movements are not prevalent in the East Asia as Christianity is not a main religion there, liberal parties in South Korea, the only country in the East Asia where Christianity is the main religion, tend to have Christian democratic tendencies. Democratic Party of Korea, which is the main liberal party of South Korea, supports building universal welfare state. However they tend to be conservative on social issues due to the influence of Christianity. Democratic Party of Korea oppose anti-discrimination law, gay marriage, civil union and abortion. 

Some researchers have placed the DPK&#x27;s position on the political spectrum to the right of Christian democracy, saying that the DPK is &quot;more [economically and socially] conservative than the centre-right German Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)&quot; in particular. The Democratic Party&#x27;s LGBT+ policy is more conservative than CDU. Because of this, some left-leaning researchers have placed the party more right-wing than Western European conservative parties. Also, many members of the Democratic Party, such as Lee Hae-chan, Moon Jae-in, and Lee Jae-myung, define the party&#x27;s de facto identity as &#x27;true conservative&#x27;, &#x27;moderate conservative&#x27; or &#x27;centre-right&#x27;. In his book titled &quot;1219 The end is beginning&quot;, Moon Jae-in writes, &quot;it is only a backward political reality unique to South Korea that political forces which are centre-right in nature are attacked for being attacked for being left-wing.&quot;

<text>Chilliwack ( ) is a city of about 100,000 people and in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located about east of the City of Vancouver in the Fraser Valley. The enumerated population is 93,203 in the city and 113,767 in the greater metropolitan area.

About two-thirds of city land is protected as part of the Agricultural Land Reserve, and agriculture accounts for about 30 percent of the local economy. The city is bounded on the north side by the Fraser River, on the south side by the Vedder River and Canada–United States border, and is surrounded by tall mountain peaks, such as Mount Cheam and Slesse Mountain.
== Etymology ==

In Halq&#x27;eméylem, the language of the Stó:lō communities around Chilliwack and Sardis, &quot;Tcil&#x27;Qe&#x27;uk&quot; means &quot;valley of many streams&quot;. It also lends its name to the Chilliwack River, and group of aboriginal people, the &quot;Ts&#x27;elxwéyeqw&quot; (also spelt &quot;Ts&#x27;elxwíqw&quot; or &quot;Sts&#x27;elxwíqw&quot;). The spelling of Chilliwack is sometimes a matter of confusion. Prior to the amalgamation of the City of Chilliwack and the Municipality of Chilliwhack, there were two different spellings. When amalgamated, the current spelling of the city was adopted. Anglicized spellings include &quot;Chilliwhyeuk&quot; and other versions closer to the original Halq&#x27;eméylem.

== History ==

The archeological record shows evidence of Stó:lō people in the Fraser Valley, or &quot;S&#x27;ólh Téméxw&quot;, 10,000 years ago. Permanent structures in the Chilliwack area date from around 5,000 years ago. It is estimated that at the time of the first contact with Europeans, there were as many as 40,000 people living within Stó:lō territory.

=== 19th century ===

In the mid-nineteenth century, thousands of gold miners transited the area &quot;en route&quot; to the goldfields of the upper Fraser River. By the mid-1860s, settlers had established farms around Codville&#x27;s Landing, Miller&#x27;s Landing, Minto Landing, Sumas Landing, and Chilliwack Landing along the Fraser River.

On 26 April 1873, the &quot;Corporation of the Township of Chilliwhack&quot; (note the variant spelling) became the third municipality incorporated by the Province of British Columbia. The town centre at the time was concentrated at Chilliwack Landing along the Fraser River. Steamboats were the main mode of transportation, carrying goods and passengers between Chilliwhack and New Westminster. After the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, many residents began to cross the Fraser River at Minto Landing to ride the train from Harrison Mills.

In 1881, with little room for expansion and the threat of floods constantly looming, the town centre was moved south to &quot;Five Corners&quot; at the junction of the New Westminster-Yale Wagon Road, Wellington Avenue and Young Road. This subdivision was initially named &quot;Centreville&quot;, but later was renamed &quot;Chilliwack&quot;, as it was more commonly referred to by locals in 1887. The area would experience catastrophic flooding in 1894, 1935, 1948 and 2021.

On 20 April 1891, Richard Plunkett Cooke, George de Wolf, and Walter E. Graveley established the Chilliwhack Railway Company.

=== Early 20th century ===

On 20 February 1908, the area that was then known as &quot;Chilliwack&quot;, i.e., the subdivision within the greater &quot;Chilliwhack Township&quot;, was proclaimed as the &quot;City of Chilliwack&quot; by letters patent issued by the provincial government under the &quot;Chilliwack City Incorporation Act&quot;. The &quot;City of Chilliwack&quot; and the &quot;Township of Chilliwhack&quot; co-existed as separately administered municipalities until 1980.

On 4 October 1910, the British Columbia Electric Railway began operating regularly scheduled passenger service on the New Westminster–Chilliwack Interurban Line.

In 1941, Camp Chilliwack was established following Canada&#x27;s entry into the Second World War in 1939. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the camp was expanded to garrison Canadian Army units for the defence of Canada&#x27;s West Coast. It continued to be used as a permanent training facility and army garrison during the Cold War. Following the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968, the base was renamed Canadian Forces Base Chilliwack (CFB Chilliwack). The base housed the following units:
=== Late 20th century ===

On 1 January 1980, the &quot;Township of Chilliwhack&quot; and the &quot;City of Chilliwack&quot; amalgamated to form a single municipality styled the &quot;District of Chilliwack&quot;, following the passage of referendae in both municipalities. On 16 July 1999, the &quot;District of Chilliwack&quot;, once again, was renamed the &quot;City of Chilliwack&quot;. To the present day, locals idiosyncratically use the same name to refer to the city as a whole, and to the old city centre. It is also the name of the greater metropolitan area encompassing adjacent sovereign indigenous nations, municipalities, and unincorporated areas.

Today it also houses supply depots for the 39 Canadian Brigade Group of the Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Army Cadets. The old quartermaster warehouse became the Canadian Military Education Centre Museum.

<text>Rerum novarum (from its incipit, with the direct translation of the Latin meaning &quot;of revolutionary change&quot;), or Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor, is an encyclical issued by Pope Leo XIII on 15 May 1891. It is an open letter, passed to all Catholic patriarchs, primates, archbishops and bishops, that addressed the condition of the working classes.

It discusses the relationships and mutual duties between labor and capital, as well as government and its citizens. Of primary concern is the need for some amelioration of &quot;the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class.&quot; It supports the rights of labor to form unions, rejects both socialism and unrestricted capitalism, while affirming the right to private property.

&quot;Rerum novarum&quot; is considered a foundational text of modern Catholic social teaching. Many of the positions in &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; are supplemented by later encyclicals, in particular Pius XI&#x27;s &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; (1931), John XXIII&#x27;s &quot;Mater et magistra&quot; (1961) and John Paul II&#x27;s &quot;Centesimus annus&quot; (1991), each of which commemorates an anniversary of the publication of &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;.

==Composition==

The first draft and content of the encyclical was written by Tommaso Maria Zigliara, professor from 1870 to 1879 at the College of Saint Thomas (rector after 1873), a member of seven Roman congregations including the Congregation for Studies, and co-founder of the Academia Romano di San Tommaso in 1870. Zigliara&#x27;s fame as a scholar at the forefront of the Thomist revival was widespread in Rome and elsewhere. &quot;Zigliara also helped prepare the great encyclicals &quot;Aeterni Patris&quot; and &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; and strongly opposed traditionalism and ontologism in favor of the moderate realism of Aquinas.&quot;

The German theologian Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler and the British Cardinal Henry Edward Manning were also influential in its composition.

== Message ==
&quot;Rerum novarum&quot; is subtitled &quot;On the Conditions of Labor&quot;. In this document, Pope Leo XIII articulates the Catholic Church&#x27;s response to the social conflict in the wake of capitalism and industrialization which had provoked socialist and communist movements and ideologies.

The pope declared that the role of the state is to promote justice through the protection of rights, while the church must speak out on social issues to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony, calming class conflict. He restated the church&#x27;s long-standing teaching regarding the crucial importance of private property rights, but recognized, in one of the best-known passages of the encyclical, that the free operation of market forces must be tempered by moral considerations:

&quot;Rerum novarum&quot; is remarkable for its vivid depiction of the plight of the nineteenth-century urban poor and for its condemnation of unrestricted capitalism. Among the remedies it prescribes are the formation of trade unions and the introduction of collective bargaining, particularly as an alternative to state intervention.

Although the encyclical follows traditional teaching concerning the rights and duties of property and the relations of employer and employee, it applies the old doctrines specifically to modern conditions (hence the title). Leo first quotes Thomas Aquinas in affirming that private property is a fundamental principle of natural law. He then quotes Gregory the Great regarding its proper use: &quot;He that hath a talent, let him see that he hide it not; he that hath abundance, let him quicken himself to mercy and generosity; he that hath art and skill, let him do his best to share the use and the utility hereof with his neighbor.&quot; Liberalism also affirms the right to private property, but communism greatly restricts or eliminates this right.

&quot;Rerum novarum&quot; also recognizes the special status of the poor in relation to social issues, expressing God&#x27;s compassion and favor for them: this is elaborated in the modern Catholic principle of the &quot;preferential option for the poor&quot;.

== Criticism of Socialism ==
Pope Leo XIII saw certain expressions of socialism as fundamentally flawed, seeking to replace rights and Catholic moral teaching with the ideology of state power. He believed that this would lead to the destruction of the family unit, where moral, productive individuals were taught and raised most successfully.

In the encyclical, the Pope says:4. To remedy these wrongs the socialists, working on the poor man&#x27;s envy of the rich, are striving to do away with private property, and contend that individual possessions should become the common property of all, to be administered by the State or by municipal bodies. They hold that by thus transferring property from private individuals to the community, the present mischievous state of things will be set to rights, inasmuch as each citizen will then get his fair share of whatever there is to enjoy. But their contentions are so clearly powerless to end the controversy that were they carried into effect the working man himself would be among the first to suffer. They are, moreover, emphatically unjust, for they would rob the lawful possessor, distort the functions of the State, and create utter confusion in the community

== Rights and duties ==

To build social harmony, the Pope proposes a framework of reciprocal rights and duties between workers and employers. Some of the duties of workers are:
* &quot;fully and faithfully&quot; to perform their agreed-upon tasks
* individually, to refrain from vandalism or personal violence
* collectively, to refrain from rioting and insurrection
Some of the duties of employers are:
* to provide work suited to each person&#x27;s strength, gender, and age
* to respect the dignity of workers and not treat them as bondsmen
By reminding workers and employers of their rights and duties, the church can form and awaken their conscience. However, the pope also recommended that civil authorities act to protect workers&#x27; rights and to keep the peace. The law should intervene no further than necessary to stop abuses. In many cases, governments had acted solely to support the interests of businesses, while suppressing workers unions attempting to bargain for better working conditions.

==Principles==
The encyclical mentions several fundamental principles to guide relationships between capital and labor.

===Dignity of the person===
Leo states that &quot;...according to natural reason and Christian philosophy, working for gain is creditable, not shameful, to a man, since it enables him to earn an honorable livelihood.&quot; He asserts that God has given human dignity to each person, creating them in God&#x27;s image and endowing them with free will and immortal souls.

To respect their workers&#x27; dignity in the workplace, employers should: 
* give time off from work to worship God, and to fulfill family obligations;
* give periods of rest, not expecting work for long hours that preclude adequate sleep;
* not require work under unsafe conditions with danger of bodily harm;
* not require work under immoral conditions that endanger the soul;
* pay a fair daily wage, for which employees should give a full day&#x27;s work.

The pope specifically mentions work in the mines, and outdoor work in certain seasons, as dangerous to health and requiring additional protections. He condemns the use of child labor as interfering with education and the development of children.

Fair wages are defined in &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; as at least a living wage, but Leo recommends paying enough to support the worker, his wife and family, with a little savings left over for the worker to improve his condition over time. He also prefers that women work at home.

===Common good===
Without recommending one form of government over another, Pope Leo puts forth principles for the appropriate role of the state. The primary purpose of a state is to provide for the common good. All people have equal dignity regardless of social class, and a good government protects the rights and cares for the needs of all its members, rich and poor. Everyone can contribute to the common good in some important way.

Leo asserts no one should be forced to share his goods; however, when one is blessed with material wealth, one has a duty to use this to benefit as many others as possible. The Catechism of the Catholic Church lists three principal aspects of the common good: 1) respect for the human person and his rights; 2) social well-being and development; and 3) peace, &quot;the stability and security of a just order.&quot;

===Subsidiarity===
Pope Leo strongly criticizes socialism for seeking to replace the rights and duties of parents, families and communities with the central supervision of the state. The civil government should not intrude into the family, the basic building block of society. However, if a family finds itself in exceeding distress due to illness, injury, or natural disaster, this extreme necessity should be met with public aid, since each family is a part of the commonwealth. By the same token, if there occur a grave disturbance of mutual rights within a household, public authority should intervene to give each party its proper due. Authorities should only intervene when a family or community is unable or unwilling to fulfill its mutual rights and duties.

== Rights and duties of property ownership ==

== Preferential option for the poor ==

Leo emphasizes the dignity of the poor and working classes.

This principle of the preferential option for the poor, however, does not appear in Rerum Novarum and was developed more fully, in radically different ways, by later theologians and popes.

This phrase, &quot;option for the poor,&quot; is not without its controversy within contemporary CST. Although regularly used today, the phrase came into common use only in the 1970s, largely among Latin American Liberation Theologians, and has accrued little papal rearticulation within the encyclical tradition. In 1968, in response to Paul VI&#x27;s Populorum Progessio, the Latin American bishops met in Medellín, Colombia, and issued a series of documents condemning &quot;structural injustice&quot; (e.g. 1:2, 2:16, 10:2, and 15:1), calling for a &quot;struggle for liberation,&quot; and insisting that &quot;in many instances Latin America finds itself faced with a situation of injustice that can be called institutional violence&quot; (2:16). The bishops in Medellín then insist on giving &quot;effective preference to the poorest and most needy sectors of society,&quot; thus giving the first voice to what is now concretized as &quot;the preferential option for the poor.&quot; Here, &quot;at Medellín in 1968 the Latin American bishops took the single most decisive step toward an &#x27;option for the poor.&quot;

== Right of association ==

Leo distinguished the larger, civil society (the commonwealth, public society), and smaller, private societies within it. Civil society exists to protect the common good and preserve the rights of all equally. Private societies serve various special purposes within civil society. Trade unions are one type of private society, and a special focus of the encyclical: &quot;The most important of all are workingmen&#x27;s unions, for these virtually include all the rest... [I]t were greatly to be desired that they should become more numerous and more efficient.&quot; Other private societies are families, business partnerships, and religious orders.

Leo strongly supported the right of private societies to exist and govern themselves:


Leo supported unions, yet opposed at least some parts of the then emerging labor movement. He urged workers, if their union seemed on the wrong track, to form alternative associations.

He deplored government suppression of religious orders and other Catholic organizations.

== Influence and legacy ==
&quot;Rerum novarum&quot; has been interpreted as both a criticism of the illusions of socialism and a primer of the Catholic response to the exploitation of workers. The encyclical also contains a proposal for a living wage, although the text does not use this term: “&quot;Wages ought not to be insufficient to support a frugal and well-behaved wage-earner.&quot;” The U.S. theologian Msgr. John A. Ryan, a trained economist, elaborated the idea in his book &quot;A Living Wage&quot; (1906).

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1911), states that the document &quot;has inspired a vast Catholic social literature, while many non-Catholics have acclaimed it as one of the most definite and reasonable productions ever written on the subject.&quot;

In 2016, the left-wing periodical &quot;Jacobin&quot; judged that, from a socialist perspective, &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; was &quot;uncomfortably&quot; situated between laborers and industrialists, and that &quot;it both opened up space for anticapitalist critique and severely restricted its horizons...&quot;

== Influence in Portugal ==

With the regime established in Portugal under António de Oliveira Salazar in the 1930s, many key ideas from the encyclical were incorporated into Portuguese law. The &quot;Estado Novo&quot; (&quot;New State&quot;) promulgated by Salazar accepted the idea of corporatism as an economic model, especially in labor relations. According to historian Howard J. Wiarda, its basic policies were deeply rooted in European Catholic social thought, especially those deriving from &quot;Rerum novarum.&quot; Portuguese intellectuals, workers organizations and trade unions and other study groups were everywhere present after 1890 in many Portuguese Republican circles, as well as the conservative circles that produced Salazar. Wiarda concludes that the Catholic social movement was not only powerful in its own right but it also resonated with an older Portuguese political culture which emphasized a natural law tradition, patrimonialism, centralized direction and control, and the &#x27;natural&#x27; orders and hierarchies of society.

<doc id="328976" wikidata="Q526080" url="?curid=328976" title="H. C. Robbins Landon">
<text>Howard Chandler Robbins Landon (March 6, 1926 – November 20, 2009) was an American musicologist, journalist, historian and broadcaster, best known for his work in rediscovering the huge body of neglected music by Haydn and in correcting misunderstandings about Mozart.

The son of a musician, Landon became enthusiastic about Haydn&#x27;s compositions in high school and was eager to pursue a career in Haydn scholarship. He studied with, among others, Karl Geiringer, an authority on Haydn, graduating with a music degree in 1947. He moved to Europe, where he lived for the rest of his life. He co-founded the Haydn Society in 1949, the goal of which was to publish and record Haydn&#x27;s works. Gaining access to archives in countries throughout Europe, he spent decades researching the life and works of Haydn. He rescued, published critical editions of, wrote books about, and with the society arranged for the recording of, numerous forgotten works. He finally published his five-volume study, &quot;Haydn: Chronicle and Works&quot;, between 1976 and 1980.

In addition to his work on Haydn, Landon and the society recorded neglected works of Mozart, and he published five popular books about Mozart, dispelling myths about the composer&#x27;s life. He had written 28 books by 1996. Landon also wrote regularly for music magazines and newspapers, especially the longest-established London paper, &quot;The Times&quot;. He was a popular broadcaster for the BBC on radio and television and was praised for his ability to enthuse general audiences with his chosen subject. From the 1970s, he was a sought-after lecturer and held appointments with colleges in the US and the UK.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Landon was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of William Grinnell Landon, a writer of Huguenot descent, and his wife Dorothea LeBaron &quot;née&quot; Robbins, a musician. He was educated at Aiken Preparatory School, Lenox School for Boys and Asheville School. While at the last he discovered the music of Haydn, which became his lifelong study.


Most of Haydn&#x27;s music had been neglected for many years. In the first half of the nineteenth century Robert Schumann wrote of him, &quot;Today it is impossible to learn anything new from him. He ... has ceased to arouse any particular interest.&quot; At the end of the century, Hubert Parry said that musicians need not be ashamed of knowing only a few of Haydn&#x27;s symphonies &quot;for Haydn is scarcely himself in this most important branch of composition till this very late period of his life.&quot; Of Haydn&#x27;s output of more than 750 works, only a tenth was available in print in the mid-twentieth century.

Landon determined to concentrate his studies on Haydn. In pursuit of this goal, he &quot;would learn several instruments, and study orchestration, harmony, several foreign languages, and history&quot;. From 1943 to 1945 he was a student at Swarthmore College, studying music theory with Alfred Swan, composition with Harl McDonald and English literature with W. H. Auden. His studies at Swarthmore ended when its Quaker administrators expelled him for an affair with a female student. From 1945 to 1947 Landon was at Boston University, studying music with Hugo Norton and Karl Geiringer, who was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the great Haydn scholar&quot;. Landon graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1947.

===Europe===
After graduating, Landon planned to go on to Harvard University to take a master&#x27;s degree, but in the interim he decided to go to Europe for the summer of 1947. While there he secured a job as foreign music correspondent for the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System. Recognizing that he would shortly be conscripted for two years&#x27; military service, Landon sought out the U.S. Army of Occupation in Vienna and volunteered as a military historian, researching and documenting the role of the Fifth Army in liberating Italy. This move gave him practical experience in handling primary sources and enabled him to remain in Vienna, writing, performing and researching.

In 1949 Landon married the harpsichordist and scholar Christa Fuhrmann, completed his military service, and returned to Boston to undertake postgraduate research. While there, he and a group of friends, including Geiringer, founded the Haydn Society. They had two aims: to publish a new complete edition of the composer&#x27;s works, and to make as many of his works as possible available on record. Their first set of records, issued within the year, was the &quot;Harmoniemesse&quot; of 1802. It sold out almost immediately. A legacy from an uncle in 1949 enabled him to return to Vienna, where he organized an ambitious program of recording, while continuing to search for forgotten Haydn scores in archives in central Europe. He remained secretary of the Haydn Society, which operated from Vienna rather than Boston after his move.

The society issued recordings of symphonies and masses that had previously been unavailable on disc. It also published the first recordings of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Great Mass in C minor&quot; and &quot;Idomeneo&quot;. Landon travelled through central and eastern Europe in search of Haydn manuscripts. He edited critical editions of Haydn&#x27;s music, principally the operas and masses, scarcely known at the time.

Among his discoveries were the manuscripts of Haydn&#x27;s opera L&#x27;anima del filosofo, that was first performed in 1951.

His first book, &quot;The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn&quot;, appeared in 1955. The book established the chronology of the symphonies, analyzed the scores, and discussed their role in 18th-century music and in Haydn&#x27;s output as a whole. Landon could turn his scholarship to practical effect. The horn players of the Vienna Philharmonic struggled to reach the high notes in Haydn&#x27;s unfamiliar Symphony No. 56; Landon established that Haydn&#x27;s horns had been designed to play in a range an octave higher, and arranged for replicas to be made.

===Writer and lecturer===
Landon wrote for many publications, including &quot;Musical America&quot;, but he said that his most important association was with &quot;The Times&quot; in London. He wrote for that paper from the early 1950s, and found its accreditation particularly useful in gaining access to archives behind the Iron Curtain. In 1957 he was appointed the paper&#x27;s &quot;special correspondent&quot;, a post he held until 1961. He became a frequent broadcaster, first on BBC radio, and later on television, where he was praised for his appeal to experts and lay people alike.

Between 1976 and 1980, Landon produced his five volume &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Haydn: Chronicle and Works&quot;. &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; rates this and Landon&#x27;s 1955 book on the symphonies as &quot;major landmarks in Haydn studies&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot;, referring to the second volume, wrote, &quot;Witty, enthralling and humane, it fulfils expectations in every possible way&quot;.
Landon did not confine his scholarship to the study of Haydn. His five books on the life and music of Mozart were aimed at a wider public than his works about Haydn, and sold in large numbers in many languages, making his name internationally known. In the wake of long-standing myths about Mozart, and new perceptions of him created by the 1979 play and 1984 film &quot;Amadeus&quot;, Landon set out the facts. He rescued Mozart&#x27;s fellow-composer Salieri from the charge of poisoning his rival, and restored the reputation of Mozart&#x27;s wife, Constanze, long thought of as &quot;a scatterbrained, lascivious woman, incapable of understanding Mozart and encouraging him to live a disorderly, if not dissolute, existence.&quot;

After discovering a copy of the Jena Symphony under the name of composer Friedrich Witt in the Göttweig Abbey archives, Landon dispelled the previous widely held belief that the symphony was an early work of Beethoven.

In Europe and America, Landon was sought after as a lecturer. In the 1960s, &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s he held professorial posts at Queen&#x27;s College, New York; the University of California; University College, Cardiff University; and Middlebury College, Vermont. His scholarship was not invariably beyond reproach. In 1993, by failing to carry out rudimentary checks, he was duped by a forgery of six &quot;Haydn&quot; piano sonatas. When venturing outside his sphere of special expertise he was sometimes criticized for lacking scholarly precision; &quot;Grove&quot; instances his books on Vivaldi, J. C. Bach and Beethoven. He was helped in his researches by many assistants, whose work he was scrupulous about acknowledging. Among his helpers were his first wife, Christa, with whom he continued to collaborate after their divorce in the mid-1950s, and his second wife, the historian Else Radant, whom he married in 1957.

===Later years===
Having made his home at various times in his career in Austria, Italy and Britain, Landon settled in 1984 at the Château de Foncoussières, Rabastens, Tarn, in southern France. Separated from his second wife in 1994, he spent his later years with a companion, Marie-Noelle Raynal-Bechetoille.
In 1990 Landon collaborated with the writer and broadcaster John Julius Norwich in presenting a five-part television series about Venice&#x27;s musical heritage under the title &quot;Maestro&quot;. They presented episodes on &quot;Venice and the Gabrielis&quot;, &quot;The World of Claudio Monteverdi&quot;, &quot;Venice and Vivaldi&quot;, &quot;Verdi and Venetian Theatre&quot;, and &quot;20th-Century Music in Venice&quot;, the last of which, including works by Stravinsky and Britten, was far away from Landon&#x27;s usual musical territory.

Landon never formally retired, but in an interview he gave two years before his death, he said that he no longer did any research: &quot;I do a few corrections, that kind of thing. But in effect I&#x27;m retired. I&#x27;m 81, so I&#x27;m allowed to retire.&quot;

Landon died at Rabastens, at the age of 83.

==Reputation and honors==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; said of Landon, &quot;Though a serious and prolific scholar, Mr. Landon also had a knack for making musicology seem exciting to the general public.&quot; Charles Rosen, in a review of Landon&#x27;s five-volume Haydn compendium, expressed admiration and gratitude to the author for his energy in bringing all of Haydn&#x27;s music, particularly the complete symphonies, to publication: &quot;Only a few decades ago there were still immense tracts of unexplored Haydn. ... That we are better off today is owing in large part to the work of Robbins Landon.&quot; However, he faults Landon for haphazard scholarship and analysis, observing that &quot;much of what he writes is sensitive and penetrating, and it is all informed by a great love of Haydn and an enthusiasm which would be infectious if the book were not so disorganized and unsystematic. ... He writes like a man going quickly through the pages of Haydn&#x27;s works and pointing out to a friend the passages he likes most.&quot;

Landon was granted honorary doctorates by Boston University (1969), Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast (1974), Bristol University (1981) and the New England Conservatory (1989), and was an honorary fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, (1980). He was awarded the Siemens Prize (1991) and the Medal of Honor of the Handel and Haydn Society (1993). He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1991. He received the Verdienstkreuz für Kunst und Wissenschaft from the Austrian Government in 1972 and the Gold Medal of the City of Vienna in 1987.

==Publications==
Landon&#x27;s output was huge; a tribute volume published for his 70th birthday in 1996 contained a bibliography listing 516 publications by him, including 28 books. In his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry Landon selected as his major publications:

<text>Excalibur is a superhero group appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They are depicted as an offshoot of the X-Men, usually based in the United Kingdom. Conceived by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer Alan Davis, they first appeared in &quot;Excalibur Special Edition&quot; #1 (1987), also known as &quot;Excalibur: The Sword is Drawn&quot;. Stories involving this team have featured elements of both the X-Men and Captain Britain franchises, frequently involving cross-dimensional travel.

The initial Excalibur roster, which was featured in the first eponymous series from 1988 to 1998, consisted of original Captain Britain Brian Braddock and his lover Meggan, along with three former members of the X-Men: Shadowcat, Nightcrawler, and the second Phoenix, Rachel Summers. A new iteration of the team was featured in the 2005 series &quot;New Excalibur&quot; until the title was replaced in 2008 by &quot;Captain Britain and MI13&quot;. Another Claremont-written series entitled &quot;Excalibur&quot;, though with no connection to the original team, chronicled the efforts of X-Men founder Professor Charles Xavier and his former nemesis Magneto to rebuild the mutant homeland of Genosha.

The current iteration of the team is led by Betsy Braddock, who took up the Captain Britain mantle during the Dawn of X.

==&quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 1): 1988–1998==
&quot;Excalibur&quot;″s original creative team, writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer Alan Davis, incorporated elements of two Marvel properties: the X-Men and Captain Britain.

The X-Men are a group of mutants—evolved human beings born with extraordinary powers—who use their abilities to defend a society that both hates and fears them. Claremont had authored their series since 1976, guiding them to tremendous success. He borrowed four characters from the X-Men, who formed the team under the mistaken impression that their fellow X-Men were dead:
*Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) – a German mutant who possesses the ability to teleport, becomes nearly invisible in shadows, and has a demon-like appearance.
*Phoenix (Rachel Summers) – a telekinetic and telepathic young woman from a dystopian future. She plays host to the Phoenix Force, a powerful cosmic entity which once posed as her mother, Jean Grey.
*Shadowcat (Kitty Pryde) – A teenage computer expert with the ability to &quot;phase&quot; through solid objects.
*Lockheed – A small dragon-like alien and Kitty&#x27;s pet.

A Marvel UK property, co-created by Claremont in 1976, Captain Britain is a protector of Great Britain, endowed with superhuman powers by the legendary wizard, Merlyn. Alan Davis and Alan Moore, during their joint early-1980s stint, established that the Marvel Universe&#x27;s Captain Britain was one of many from various dimensions and that one of his main roles is guarding the lighthouse that is placed at the convergence of realities.

Excalibur, which also featured shapeshifter Meggan, first gathered together in &quot;Excalibur Special Edition&quot; #1 (1988) and were soon featured in a monthly &quot;Excalibur&quot; series. With the help of a manic, dimension-hopping robot named Widget, they embarked on a series of adventures through parallel worlds.

Claremont left with &quot;Excalibur&quot; #34 (1991). Beginning with &quot;Excalibur&quot; #42, Davis returned to the series, this time as both writer and penciller, and resolved many plotlines that Claremont had left unconcluded. He also added several new members, including the mystic Feron, the warrior Kylun, and the alien Cerise; and also introduced the size-shifter Micromax. (In an interview in &quot;Wizard&quot; #6, Davis said that he was adding four new team members to the team. Presumably, if Davis&#x27; run had not ended prematurely, Micromax would have become a full member of the team during Davis&#x27; tenure, rather than the start of Lobdell&#x27;s.)

In a jarring transition, Captain Britain was lost off-panel, Meggan was suddenly catatonic from losing him, and the newer members were summarily dispatched. Marvel stationed the team on Muir Island, off the coast of Scotland, and tied the series closer to the X-Men mythos, casting off most Captain Britain-related elements, in addition to the characters that did not have close ties to the X-Universe, like Kylun and Feron. Phoenix was written out and, when Captain Britain returned, he began using the alias &quot;Britannic&quot;. Lobdell also introduced Douglock, an amalgam of two previously deceased members of the New Mutants: the techno-organic alien Warlock and the linguistic savant Cypher. Nightcrawler&#x27;s former lover, the mystic Amanda Sefton, also joined the team, using the codename Daytripper.

Revisions made under Warren Ellis included reverting Britannic back to Captain Britain and adding Pete Wisdom, a cynical British spy who could manifest solar energy in the form of &quot;hot knives&quot; that could be shot out from his fingers. Ellis also developed a romantic relationship between Wisdom and Shadowcat. At the insistence of Marvel editors, Ellis also added Wolfsbane, a Scottish werewolf-like young woman from the New Mutants and X-Factor, and Colossus, the Russian X-Man who can turn his flesh into organic steel.

Sales fell and Marvel canceled the series, partially so Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, and Colossus could return to the X-Men. The series ended with issue #125 (1998), featuring the wedding of Meggan and a de-powered Captain Britain.

==&quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 2): 2001==
In 2001, a four-issue limited series titled &quot;Excalibur&quot;, featuring Captain Britain, Meggan, Psylocke, the Black Knight, Sir Benedict, Captain U.K., and Crusader X, detailed Captain Britain&#x27;s rise to become king of the extra-dimensional realm of Otherworld.

The solicited cover to issue #1 featured a new costume for Captain Britain that was different from the one that he actually received in the comic, but the cover was unused.

==&quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 3): 2004==
In 2004, Marvel Comics launched a new ongoing series titled &quot;Excalibur&quot;, this time dealing with the efforts of Professor Xavier and Magneto to rebuild the devastated mutant nation of Genosha (which was destroyed at the beginning of Grant Morrison&#x27;s X-Men run).

Other cast members included Callisto, another mutant leader and former member of the Morlocks, and newcomers such as Wicked, Freakshow, Shola Inkosi, and Karima Shapandar. Archangel and Husk also appeared in the series. The grouping never laid claim to the name Excalibur, despite the title of the series. The series&#x27; last issue was #14, released in May, 2005. Events of the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline concluded Xavier&#x27;s and Magneto&#x27;s partnership. Afterward, the mutant members of the group showed up in the &quot;Son of M&quot; series, where it was revealed they had all lost their powers due to the &quot;Decimation&quot;. However, they used Quicksilver&#x27;s stolen Terrigen Mist to bring their powers back, which caused them to go out of control, but the effect wore off later, leaving them human. Ironically, issues of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; during the time of this &quot;Excalibur&quot; had much in common with the original &quot;Excalibur&quot;: lighthearted stories by Chris Claremont, colorful art by Alan Davis and Mark Farmer, characters including Nightcrawler and Rachel Summers, and even a cameo appearance by Captain Britain.

==&quot;New Excalibur&quot; (2005–2007)==
The letters page of the final issue of &quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 3) announced a relaunch of the title as &quot;New Excalibur&quot; in November, 2005. This incarnation of the book was written by Claremont. &quot;New Excalibur&quot; has more in common with the original series than the Genosha-based book had, for it features Captain Britain and Peter Wisdom as main characters and takes place in London. Other characters include the reformed villain-turned-X-Man the Juggernaut, the former X-Women Sage and the Dazzler, and Nocturne, formerly of the Exiles.

As with many of Marvel&#x27;s late 2005 books, it spun out of the after-effects of &quot;House of M&quot;. Four issues of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; laid the foundation for &quot;New Excalibur&quot;. Captain Britain brought the team together in &quot;New Excalibur&quot; #5, preceding an attack from Lionheart, Albion, and the Warwolves. Later, the team faced an attack by Black Air and Black Tom Cassidy, who was depowered due to &quot;M-Day.&quot; Black Air retreated after the Dazzler, Wisdom, Nocturne, and Captain Britain trounced them. Black Tom surrendered after the Juggernaut talked him down and made him feel guilty about killing the Juggernaut&#x27;s friend, Sammy Paré / Squidboy. Sage confronted the Dark Charles Xavier from Shadow-X in an astral fight, where Sage shot his astral form and won.

Psylocke joins New Excalibur and assisted them during an attack by the Shadow King, who was responsible for the creation of Shadow-X. Psylocke plunged a psi-blade into Dark Xavier, saved New Excalibur, and vanished in a flash of light. Captain Britain believes her to be dead, unaware that she has joined the Exiles. Since the incident with Psylocke, New Excalibur has met up with a repowered Chamber, visited and saved Camelot (while the Black Knight temporarily traveled with them), and have attempted to help the Juggernaut with some troubles stemming from his powers that he received from the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak. Nocturne had a stroke and the team is trying to help her recover.

Later on, Albion tells his story to Lionheart. He is a Brian Braddock from another world, where their first World War never ended and he chose the sword over the amulet. He brought his world peace, but people kept starving and dying. When he met an alternate Captain Britain, he moved onto the latter&#x27;s world and from there began a killing spree on the Captain Britain Corps. He then meets Shadow-X and Michelle Scicluna, a Black Air agent, and they prepare to take on New Excalibur. Rivalry sets them apart, though, and Sage infiltrates them as Diana Fox. Albion manages to take down all of England&#x27;s energy-using objects and conquers it, with Sage developing a new persona subordinate to him. They kill both Dark Cyclops and the Dark Beast, forcing New Excalibur and Shadow-X to ally to make what might be their last stand. Dark Marvel Girl, the Juggernaut, and the Dark Angel create a diversion, at the cost of the latter&#x27;s life, to allow the Dazzler, the Dark Iceman, and Pete Wisdom to combine their powers and blind all of the Captains while Nocturne, who has left the hospital while possessing a Captain&#x27;s body, evacuates the civilians. Captain Britain arrives to face Albion and tries to bring Sage back to normal and the two Brian Braddocks prepare to face off. Captain Britain then defeats Albion, as Dark Marvel Girl finds the device that Albion had used and is able to reactivate all of the technology in Great Britain.

&quot;New Excalibur&quot; #24 was the final issue of this title, with the storylines carrying over into the crossover miniseries &quot;X-Men: Die by the Sword&quot;.

===&quot;X-Men: Die by the Sword&quot;===

Psylocke and Thunderbird travel to Earth-616 to visit Captain Britain and Nocturne during New Excalibur&#x27;s victory party. During the party, however, Captain Britain is wounded by a strike force led by an armored lady called Rouge-Mort. While Psylocke tries to care for her brother, everybody else tries to fight. Realizing that they cannot win, they teleport to the Panoptichron. There, the Dazzler discovers that Longshot, while alive, does not remember her and is about to kill herself to ease her pain when Mystique comes to talk her out of it. Nocturne happily reunites with her former teammates, while Sage is deemed the best option to care for Captain Britain. Meanwhile, Cat, using the scanner, realizes that Roma and Saturnyne are in trouble. The Corps then suffers a lot of losses, despite Saturnyne&#x27;s intervening. While Cat checks on Brian, Blink, Morph, Sabretooth, Thunderbird, and the Dazzler join the battlefield. The Dazzler battles Rouge-Mort, who has badly wounded Roma, while Morph battles James Jaspers by morphing into the Fury, but his plan is quickly foiled. Sage, Psylocke, and Wisdom recruit Albion to their cause, who proves to be a match for James Jaspers until Jaspers turns into the Fury. Merlyn then comes to his daughter to finish the job, only to be beaten by Psylocke. Captain Britain then makes his move on the Fury and, with the help of Blink and Albion, vanquishes him for now, leading to Merlyn&#x27;s defeat. However, this victory comes with a price as Roma dies, though not before transferring her knowledge into Sage&#x27;s mind. Saturnyne then promises to free Albion from jail to lead the Corps, while Sage and Nocturne switch teams with Longshot, who now remembers the highlights of his past. New Excalibur, now with only four members, disbands after the final battle with Merlyn.

==&quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 4): 2019==

&quot;Excalibur&quot; was relaunched as a part of Dawn of X in October 2019. The initial roster included Betsy Braddock as the new Captain Britain, Gambit, Rogue, Jubilee, Rictor and Apocalypse.

Betsy Braddock, returned to her original body, has spent time reconnecting with her brother Captain Britain and his wife Meggan. Although she is excited to move to Krakoa, Betsy is hesitant to use the Psylocke codename and actively avoids Kwannon, whose body she had taken over for many years. Egg informs her that he and the rest of The Five have resurrected her brother Jamie although she is reluctant to let him back into her life. Apocalypse informs her that a new Krakoan gateway has appeared but it is being blocked from the other side. As the gate leads to Avalon, one of the kingdoms of Otherworld, he requests that she speak with Captain Britain and use his amulet to travel there and investigate. Betsy and Britain travel to Camelot and are confronted by Morgan le Fay, who is trying to work out why the gate has appeared as it is siphoning her magic. Believing it to be the fault of Earth&#x27;s mages, she attacks Betsy, taking control of Captain Britain to do so though Betsy escapes using the amulet. On Krakoa, Apocalypse summons Rogue, Gambit and Jubilee, informing them of the situation and uses Rogue&#x27;s powers to weaken the gate enough for it to be destroyed. However, the resulting magical explosion encases her in a flower coffin. Betsy takes Rogue, Gambit and Jubilee to the older Excalibur lighthouse but finds that Morgan has burned it down. Rogue&#x27;s flowers make her an extension of Krakoa and a new lighthouse made of plants is constructed, with Rogue as its light. Mages from Clan Akkaba, those misguidedly loyal to Apocalypse, attack the lighthouse but Excalibur fight them off. Despite the protests of the others, Apocalypse arrives and promises to protect Rogue while the others head to Camelot to rescue Captain Britain however, Morgan&#x27;s forces are too powerful and they have to retreat, leading Betsy to take up the mantle of Captain Britain until she can free her brother. Apocalypse finds Rictor, who has lost control of his powers, and convinces him to come to Krakoa.

Apocalypse sends Gambit and Rictor underground to steal magic-infused crystals while, unbeknownst to Apocalypse, Prestige (at Gambit&#x27;s request) telepathically infiltrates Rogue&#x27;s mind and helps to free her. Apocalypse is enraged when he finds out Rogue has been awoken prematurely as this interferes with his plans. As revenge, Rogue kills Apocalypse, who is later resurrected on Krakoa by the Five and arrives in Camelot to convince Morgan le Fay to allow them to settle their grievances with a duel between Captain Britain and her brother. When Betsy defeats Brian, Apocalypse reveals that he has crowned Jamie as King and Morgan is taken away to be experimented on by Apocalypse. Brian, freed from Morgan&#x27;s control finds that he is no longer fit to be Captain Britain and officially bequeaths the title to Betsy. Apocalypse and Exodus request that Excalibur obtain warwolf heads as they have magical qualities, leading the team into conflict with Cullen Bloodstone, is also hunting them. Apocalypse tasks Excalibur with planting a gateway in the Starlight Citadel, which brings them into conflict with Lady Saturnyne, who refuses to accept Betsy as the new Captain Britain. Gamits steals a gem from the Citadel which houses the life force of Candra but does not tell Rogue. Candra warns Gambit that Apocalypse is planning something and begs him not to give her gem to him, though Gambit refuses and throws it into the gateway. Apocalypse gathers the Externals tells them that they are obsolete, as all mutants now have the ability to be resurrected, and teams up with Rictor, Selene, Gideon and Absalom to kill the other Externals so that their life forces can be used as fuel to power the gate via a magical ritual.

During the X of Swords event, Apocalypse reveals that his motives for powering the External Gate was so that he could reach Arakko, an island that was once part of Krakoa, where his wife Genesis and their children, his original Four Horsemen have been trapped thousands of years fighting demons. He takes Summoner, Banshee and Unus the Untouchable with him through the gate to Otherworld but they are betrayed when Summoner reveals himself as the son of War and the Horsemen attack, gravely injuring Apocalypse and Banshee while capturing Unus. A rescue mission similarly goes awry but the fighting is stopped by Saturnyne, who declares that a tournament be held between the champions of Krakoa and Arakko in order to avoid all-out war which could potentially destabilize Otherworld, of which she is regent. As the champions search for their prophesied weapons, the Braddock siblings visit the Citadel to retrieve the Starlight Sword. During their search, Saturnyne expresses her hatred for Betsy, locks her in prison and states that she is unworthy to be Captain Britain because she did not have to choose between the amulet and the sword as is tradition because she was simply given it by Brian back in Avalon. Jamie frees Betsy and they go to Saturnyne&#x27;s chambers, where Brian seduces her, distracting her long enough for Betsy to claim the Starlight Sword. As revenge, Saturnyne declares that the first fight during the tournament is between Betsy and Isca the Unbeaten, an Arakki mutant with the power to never lose. When Betsy attempts to parry one of Isca&#x27;s attacks, the Starlight Sword shatters immediately and so does Betsy, who is presumed dead. Saturnyne takes the pieces to her chambers and uses them to revive the Captain Britain Corps but is distraught when they are all made in Betsy&#x27;s image rather than Brian&#x27;s. Following the conclusion of the tournament, Apocalypse returns to Arakko with his family.

Following the departure of Apocalypse and the death of Betsy, the rest of Excalibur are lost and unsure of what to do next. Rogue and Gambit submit a request to X-Factor to have Betsy resurrected but Northstar and Prestige state that there is no way to know whether Betsy died during the fight with Isca or not and therefore won&#x27;t risk reviving her, much to the team&#x27;s frustration. They head to Avalon, where Brian has taken on the mantle of Captain Avalon and works as the protector of Jamie&#x27;s throne. Meggan volunteers to accompany them into Otherworld to see if Betsy is still alive while Jamie secretly makes a deal with Mister Sinister to create a clone of Betsy. In an alternate timeline, Betsy awakens and finds that has taken the place of Queen Elizabeth III, with Angel as her secret lover. She explains to him that she needs to return to her original universe and Angel states that his ex-wife, Kwannon, can help smuggle her to Otherworld. During the mission, Betsy tries to talk to Kwannon about their history in her timeline but Kwannon becomes angry and forces her through the portal. Excalibur team up with Pete Wisdom to defend the Lighthouse from Clan Akkaba, who have turned the British people against Betsy, a mutant Captain Britain who abandoned them for Krakoa. Betsy returns but isolates herself, refusing to talk to anyone, leading Rogue to suspect that she is not their original Betsy. Emma Frost arrives and declares that the Krakoan Council attempted to arrange an audience with Saturnyne but, as they did not have a Captain Britain to represent them, their request was refused but, now that Betsy is back, she must do her job. Rogue and Rictor go to Apocalypse&#x27;s old lab to look for answers, where it is reveal that Apocalypse had left all of his magical research to Rictor. They are attacked by Betsy but saved by Kwannon, who declares that is not the real Betsy Braddock.

Other members of the Captain Britain Corps attempt to search for Betsy until one of them, Elspeth Braddock, finally locates her consciousness and traps it in a lamp. She, along with Queen Elizabeth III who has been returned to her body, and the rest of the Corps, go to the Citadel to get Saturnyne to revive Betsy but she outright refuses. Excalibur use Jamie&#x27;s clone of Betsy and one of Apocalypse&#x27;s rituals to try to bring Betsy back to life but the spell doesn&#x27;t work. Kwannon releases Betsy&#x27;s consciousness and uses the connection between them to track it down in Otherworld. Betsy and Kwannon have a psychic battle where they reconcile their past and Kwannon temporarily acts as the host for Betsy&#x27;s consciousness until she returns it to the clone body, reviving her. Rogue then reveals that she knows who the fake Betsy was: Malice, who is now loose in Krakoa. 

During the Hellfire Gala, Betsy attends a meeting with Professor X, Emma Frost and the UK ambassador, who is secretly a member of Clan Akkaba. He expresses his dislike for a mutant Captain Britain and announces that the UK will no longer be an ally of Krakoa. Rictor is sent into a spiral when Shatterstar appears and tries to reconnect, causing him to cleave the piece of land where the Lighthouse stands into a new island off the coast of the UK. Clan Akkaba murder Pete Wisdom in order to fully revive Morgan le Fay.

<text>Amazing Adult Fantasy, retitled Amazing Fantasy in its final issue, is an American comic book anthology series published by Marvel Comics from 1961 through 1962, with the latter title revived with superhero features in 1995 and in the 2000s. The final 1960s issue, &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (cover-dated Aug. 1962), introduced the popular Marvel superhero Spider-Man. &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot; premiered with issue #7, taking over the numbering from &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;.

==Publication history==

The science fiction-fantasy anthology &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot; began with issue #7 (cover-dated Dec. 1961), having taken over the number of the similar anthology &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;. The earlier issues before the title change featured stories drawn by a number of artists including Jack Kirby, Don Heck and Steve Ditko. &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot; featured exclusively the quick, quirky, twist-ending tales of artist Ditko and writer-editor Stan Lee that had appeared in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; and sister titles primarily featuring rampaging monsters. The cover of the comic carried the motto &quot;The magazine that respects your intelligence&quot;.

Lee in 2009 described these &quot;short, five-page filler strips that Steve and I did together&quot;, originally &quot;placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill&quot;, as &quot;odd fantasy tales that I&#x27;d dream up with O. Henry-type [twist] endings&quot;. Giving an early example of what would later be known as the &quot;Marvel Method&quot; of writer-artist collaboration, Lee said: &quot;All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he&#x27;d be off and running. He&#x27;d take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect&quot;.

With issue #15 (Aug. 1962) &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot; was retitled &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot;. This issue&#x27;s lead feature introduced the superhero Spider-Man, written by Lee and drawn by Ditko, although Lee rejected Ditko&#x27;s cover art and commissioned Jack Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked. As Lee explained in 2010: &quot;I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack&#x27;s covers&quot;. In numerous interviews Lee has recalled how the title had been slated for cancellation, and so with nothing to lose, publisher Martin Goodman reluctantly agreed to allow him to introduce Spider-Man, a new kind of superhero – one who would be a teenager, but not a sidekick, and one who would have everyman doubts, neuroses and money problems. However, while this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that &quot;the Spiderman [sic] ... will appear every month in &quot;Amazing&quot;&quot;.

Regardless, sales for &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 proved to be one of Marvel&#x27;s highest at the time, so the company launched the series &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; seven months later.

The DVD release of the collector&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film included a copy of &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15. In 2001, Marvel published the 10-issue historical overview &quot;The 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time&quot;, with &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 topping the list.

In 2008, an anonymous donor gave the original 24 pages of Ditko art for &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 to the Library of Congress, which included Spider-Man&#x27;s debut and the stories &quot;The Bell-Ringer&quot;, &quot;Man in the Mummy Case&quot;, and &quot;There Are Martians Among Us&quot;.

===Continuation in 1995===
For decades, no attempts were made to relaunch the title or to continue it with an issue #16. However, in 1995, Marvel editor Danny Fingeroth decided a story gap existed between &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #1. In an attempt to fill that gap, Marvel published three Spider-Man flashback stories in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #16–18 (Dec. 1995 – March 1996), each written by Kurt Busiek and painted chiefly by Paul Lee.

===Volume 2===

The second volume of the series ran 20 issues (cover-dated Aug. 2004 – June 2006).

The first arc ran through (vol. 2) #1–6 and featured a new teenaged heroine, Araña. The second arc, in (vol. 2) #7–12, published after a short hiatus, featured a revamped, female version of the supervillain the Scorpion. A back-up feature in (vol. 2) #10–12 (Sept.-Nov. 2005) starred the character Nina Price, the Vampire by Night, and (vol. 2) #13–14 (both Dec. 2005) led with the modern-West feature &quot;Vegas&quot;, backed up by &quot;Captain Universe&quot;. In an attempt to replicate history, Marvel announced that the new issue #15 would introduce a new generation of heroes in a 48-page standalone issue. These heroes included Amadeus Cho, Blackjack, the Great Video, Monstro, the Heartbreak Kid, and Positron. The cover to #15 was a revamped version of the original &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 cover, complete with Spider-Man swinging through a modern-day New York City, while the new heroes watch in awe in the background.

The final arc, in (vol. 2) #16–20 (Feb.-June 2006), introduced Death&#x27;s Head 3.0, a revamp of the Marvel UK character, written by the original version&#x27;s creator, Simon Furman. Issues #18–19 contain two &quot;Tales of the New Universe&quot; stories as backup features, while #20 featured a Western backup, &quot;Steamrider&quot;.

=== Volume 3 ===
The third volume ran for five issues (cover dated September 2021 - February 2022). Written and drawn by Kaare Andrews, it follows numerous characters who wake up on a mysterious island with no memory of how they arrived.

<text>Simcoe is an unincorporated community and former town in Southwestern Ontario, Canada near Lake Erie. It is the county seat and largest community of Norfolk County. Simcoe is at the junction of Highway 3, at Highway 24, due south of Brantford, and accessible to Hamilton by nearby Highway 6. The largest of the communities in Norfolk County, Simcoe had a population of 16,121 at the time of the 2021 Census.

==History==
Simcoe was founded in 1795 by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. Initially, the settlement consisted of two distinct areas, Birdtown, named by William Bird who arrived in the early 1800s and the Queensway which grew up around Aaron Culver&#x27;s sawmill and grist mill in the 1820s. The post office opened in 1829 and was called Simcoe. In 1837, the village became the seat of government of the then Talbot District.

A historical plaque adds that Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe gave land to Aaron Culver in 1795 on the agreement that he would build mills; after they were in operation, a hamlet formed by 1812, although it was burned down by American troops in 1814. Between 1819 and 1823 Culver laid out a village; streets were surveyed in 1835 to 1836.

Records from 1846 indicate that the settlement was far from any major roads and had little communication with areas outside of Brantford, and that a stone court house and jail had already been built; the courthouse would be destroyed by fire in 1863 and rebuilt. There were three churches, Methodist, Baptist, and Congregationalist. A weekly newspaper is published here, the &quot;Long Point Advocate&quot;. The population was about 1,400. The post office was receiving mail daily. This settlement contained the offices of the Judge of District Court, Sheriff, Clerk of Peace, Inspector of Licenses, Crown Lands Agent, District Clerk, Treasurer, Clerk of District Court, Deputy Clerk of Crown and the Superintendent of Schools. Already operating were two grist-mills, two sawmills, a brewery, two distilleries, a foundry, a fulling mill, nine stores, six taverns, two druggists, a bank (Gore)(absorbed into Canadian Bank of Commerce) and many tradesmen.

The population in 1850 was about 1,600; in that year, Simcoe became the County seat of Norfolk County. It had increased to 2,100 by 1869 and two banks had opened.

Simcoe was incorporated as a town in 1878. In 1974, Simcoe amalgamated with part of Charlotteville, Townsend, Windham and Woodhouse townships. In 2001, the town was amalgamated with Delhi, Norfolk and half of Nanticoke to become Norfolk County.

The County passed its first tree conservation by-law in 1947. This law was revised in 2000 as a part of Norfolk County&#x27;s &quot;Forestry Act&quot;. Around 350 applications for tree cutting permits are sent to Norfolk council per year. For every 100 acres of undeveloped land in Norfolk County, more than 25 of those acres are considered to be forested. Most of these forests can be found within of downtown Simcoe and are open for exploration except during periods of heavy snow.

==Community and culture==
One of the town&#x27;s notable landmarks is the Norfolk County Carillon Memorial Tower that commemorates the lives of local soldiers who died for Canada in conflicts overseas. The Carillon Memorial Tower overlooks scenic Wellington Park, a public greenspace that includes walking paths and a waterway system with a small lake, close to the downtown core.

Simcoe&#x27;s main cemetery is Oakwood Cemetery.

A cultural club for people of Croatian descent operates in the town; the formal name given to this organization is the 531st branch of the Croatian Fraternal Union. First organized by Franjo Bertovic during the 1990s, and he went on to found other Croatian Fraternal Unions throughout Canada and Croatia. Members of this fraternal benefit society refer to the club as the &quot;Simcoe Croatian Club&quot; when not in formal conversation. Expenses for sick workers in addition to their funeral expenses are often partially covered through its members&#x27; benefits.

The historic Molson Bank operated here from May 1898 until sometime in the 1920s; when the Bank of Montreal took over the building. Alterations made to the building within those decades would allow twice as much banking to take place. Fifteen more people were hired during the expansion of the bank in the early 20th century; bringing white collar jobs to the town.

Many of Simcoe&#x27;s buildings feature the International style of architecture; typical of the period between 1920 and 1950 while residential buildings from the 1850s use the Gothic Revival style of architecture. The relatively tall buildings that came out of the &quot;International&quot; style (compared to the buildings in Simcoe prior to the 1950s) were used to make Simcoe into a more international destination for people to live, work, and admire. A couple of buildings in the downtown core even blend &quot;International&quot; elements with the Art Deco style of architecture; bringing bright colors and illusions of rapid movement into the building design.

The only operating alligator tugboat remaining in the world, the &quot;W.D. Stalker&quot;, is in Simcoe.

Simcoe has a radio station, 98.9 myFM, and two newspapers: The Simcoe Reformer and the Norfolk News. CHCH-DT in Hamilton is the nearest broadcast television station along with CKCO-DT in Kitchener and CIII-DT (a Toronto station with a repeater in Paris, Ontario). CHCH (channel 11 on Eastlink Cable - formerly Amtelecom Cable) is mostly a news channel while CKCO (CTV Two) and CIII (Global) offer a variety of entertainment choices during prime time (7 PM through 11 PM on weekdays).

Major local festivals include the Rotary-sponsored Friendship Festival, the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show, and the winter light show of Panorama. Simcoe was one of the communities in Canada that relayed the Olympic torch, which travelled from Athens, Greece to Vancouver for the 21st Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The &quot;Simcoe Santa Claus Parade&quot; has been historically held on the weekend following Remembrance Day. During the heyday of this event in the 1950s, the town would stop operating for one afternoon for people to enjoy the festivities. In recent years, the parade has held a lower profile; with people preferring &quot;warm weather&quot; events like the Friendship Festival and the Norfolk County Fair.

==Climate==
Simcoe, like all of Norfolk County, Ontario has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). Winters are cold with a January average of in January and most days have maximum temperatures below . Though winters are cold, mild stretches of weather can bring temperatures above in January. The average annual snowfall is , with maximum accumulations occurring in February when the snow depth is . Summers are warm and humid with a July high of and a July low of . Temperatures above occur 10 days per year. The average annual precipitation is , which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. Delhi averages 2021 hours of bright sunshine per year or 43% of daylight hours, ranging from a low of 21.2% in December to 62.2% in July.

The hottest day ever recorded for Simcoe was on August 28, 1973 when the local weather station registered temperatures up to . Simcoe&#x27;s coldest ever temperatures occurred on January 18, 1976 when temperatures of were detected by local weather authorities. Traditionally, temperatures have ranged between in January to in July during times of moderate climate.

As a rural community, Simcoe is generally 10% drier than the major cities of Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa. It is also 25 times less likely to face smog-related problems between the months of June and September than metropolitan cities like London, Windsor, and Sarnia. Sunny days tend to last 15% longer; granting more needed sunlight for summer days in addition to forestalling the cold and dark winter nights.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 census, Simcoe had a population of 16,121 living in 7,118 of its 7,406 total private dwellings, a change of 15.8% from its 2016 population of 13,922. With a land area of it had a population density of 977/km2 (377.22 square miles) in 2021.

==Housing and neighbourhoods==
The monthly rent of a typical apartment in Simcoe ranges from 713 Canadian dollars per month (for a bachelor apartment in a working class neighbourhood) to 1,500 Canadian dollars (for the same bachelor apartment newer and more posh neighbourhood). While the monthly rent for a rented apartment is considered inexpensive by global standards, the typical cost of eating at a restaurant in the community can vary from being reasonable to expensive; it depends primarily on the genre of the establishment and the type of food products being used in the preparation. Fast food restaurants and Chinese restaurants tend to be reasonable while Italian restaurants and pizza places tend to be expensive.

The average age of a Simcoe resident as of 2011 is 48 years of age; the average male is 47 years old while the average female is 50 years old. While almost 6,000 people who living in Simcoe are legally married as of 2011, a substantial number of people who never married live in Simcoe; nearly 3,000 people in Simcoe remain single and have never been engaged in a legal or common-law marriage. English is the most spoken language in Simcoe; with Ojibway and several Eastern European languages spoken by a small minority of the residents.

==Transportation and tourism==
In 1886 the South Norfolk Railway constructed a line from Hamilton, Ontario, to Port Rowan, Ontario, that stopped in Simcoe.
The train operated until 1965. Economic considerations in addition to rising energy and fuel prices are what basically killed the train operations in Norfolk County during the latter portion of the 20th century.

A local transit program is centred around Simcoe and helps to serve the major communities of Norfolk County. It costs at least $17,000 for a budget vehicle for families in Simcoe (Toyota Corolla or any of its equivalents) and at least $19,195 for a budget vehicle for 1-2 people (Volkswagen Golf or any of its equivalents).

There are 50 hotels and bed and breakfast properties within a reasonable driving distance of Simcoe&#x27;s downtown core; having on-peak rates of anywhere between $97/night to $150/night in addition to off-peak rates ranging from $55/night to $129/night.

A country club was established in Simcoe by Duncan Campbell in 1895 called the &quot;Norfolk County Golf and Country Club&quot;. It originally excluded ladies from membership and hard liquor from being consumed until 1912 when the club was incorporated. When it first became an inclusive golf club, ladies had the &quot;privilege&quot; of paying $4 to access the facilities while the gentlemen had to pay a handsome $15 to be entitled to full privileges. This country club still exists and visitors are encouraged to acquire memberships before playing golf.

==Employment==
Simcoe is on a positive trajectory of employment growth, which corresponds with their population growth in recent years. Rural Canadian towns similar to Simcoe are struggling due to economic and transportation issues that prevent people from holding meaningful employment and being prosperous. Towns like Eastend in Saskatchewan, Grey River in Newfoundland and Dollard in Saskatchewan are facing general hardships due to diminishing transportation choices, aging residents and bleak local employment opportunities. Simcoe&#x27;s infrastructure and close proximity to urban markets are some of the reasons why Simcoe is not in any great economic peril within the next 30 years.

=== Manufacturing sector ===
One of the earliest manufacturers to operate in Simcoe is the West &amp; Peachey Company, an equipment and boiler maker company that invented an amphibious steamboat called an Alligator. Known as an alligator boat, this was used by logging companies all over Eastern North America in 1878. The firm built 230 alligator tugs between 1889 and 1932.

In 1929, American Can Company began its manufacturing operations in Simcoe. During the 42 years that it was operating, this metal-can manufacturing plant employed many local residents. The Canadian Canning Company, which had been in operation in Simcoe since the 1870s, was a primary customer for some of the products of the American Can Plant, and was a producer of canned fruit, vegetable, and processed prepared foodstuffs, such as soup. This processing plant relied heavily on fruit and vegetables produced locally. In 1991, the Robinson street manufacturing plants closed. The shutdown of the plants can be partially attributed to the recession of the early 1990s. At its prime, American Can Company employed 605 male employees and 39 female employees with highly competitive wages. During the Second World War, the Simcoe plant employed many women on a full-time basis, due to the shortage of men who had gone off to fight in the war. The plant continued to produce cans for the food industry, along with specialized packaging needed for the war effort. Notable MPP Charles Strange from the historical Brantford electoral district worked at this plant in his later life and lived in Simcoe.

Small factories once were dominant in the southeastern end of Simcoe until the early 2000s, when high-wage manufacturing jobs started to be outsourced to low-wage regions like China, Bangladesh, and Singapore, which was a prevalent trend across Ontario. In 2011, Statistics Canada estimated that 11.1% of Simcoe&#x27;s labour force is employed in the manufacturing industry, slightly higher than the province average of 10.2%. In 2018, Toyotetsu announced a multi-million dollar expansion of their manufacturing facilities in Simcoe. Their first manufacturing plant in the northwestern end of Simcoe, built in 2006, employs approximately 170 full-time personnel in metal parts stamping and fabrication for the automotive industry. Since their inception, Toyotetsu has steadily expanded their production facilities in the community.

==Health==
There are 24 physicians who practice within the city limits. Most of the doctors do not accept new patients, with the exception of the terminally ill, pregnant women, and their families. This situation is expected to clear itself within five to ten years.

Simcoe is home to the Norfolk General Hospital; the only hospital in Norfolk County.

Norfolk General Hospital is the governing agency for Holmes House. Operating since 1989, Holmes House has been operating across the street from Norfolk General Hospital. It provides services to help recovering drug addicts manage their addiction using a co-education detoxification program. Applicants over 16 years old are accepted and the facility does not provide medicinal treatment for withdrawal symptoms.

There are many other social health and welfare programs available in Simcoe that benefit all residents of the community. Some are available from organizations such as Haldimand-Norfolk Women&#x27;s Services near downtown Simcoe.

<doc id="328983" wikidata="Q1632777" url="?curid=328983" title="Porta Capena">
<text>The Porta Capena was a gate in the Servian Wall in Rome, Italy.
The gate was located in the area of Piazza di Porta Capena, where the Caelian, Palatine and Aventine hills meet. Probably its exact position was between the entrance of Via di Valle delle Camene and the beginning of Via delle Terme di Caracalla (known as the &quot;Archaeological Walk&quot;), facing the curved side of the Circus Maximus.

Nowadays Piazza di Porta Capena hosts the FAO Headquarters. Between 1937 and 2004, it was home to the obelisk of Axum.

== History ==
The valley around what is now the avenue of the Baths of Caracalla was in ancient times covered with woods, caves, and freshwater springs.
In this area (called the valley of the &quot;Camenae&quot;), considered sacred and mysterious, it is said (and Livy punctually reports) that the peaceful king Numa Pompilius, the first successor of Romulus, had his nocturnal encounters with the goddess (or nymph) Egeria, who on those occasions provided him with all the necessary information for the institution of the rites most pleasing to each divinity, as well as the related priestly functions.
Whether he was in good or bad faith, with this expedient the king managed to keep calm for several years a rough and ignorant people, who could not let off steam in the war. Therefore, this area can be considered the cradle of the religion of ancient Rome.

Its location and some testimonies suggest that the gate was originally called &quot;Camena&quot; and that its construction may even be earlier than that of the Servian Wall.
The first historical-legendary mention dates back to the time of King Tullus Hostilius (mid-7th century BC): it refers to the fact that the funerary monument to Horatia – the sister of the Horatii, killed because she was guilty of falling in love of one of the Curiatii – was erected close to the gate.

In 489 BC, it was from Porta Capena that a multitude of young Volsci was driven out of Rome, while they waited for the games, according to the project of Coriolanus to foment their animosity against Rome and prepare for the subsequent war.

In 312 BC the Appian Way was built, starting from the gate and having the city of Capua as its arrival point: for this reason, the name of the gate was changed into Capena and the whole area, already relevant for various reasons, assumed a very important role as a major point of transit and contact with southern Italy.

In literary evidence, the gate is also mentioned for another important event that deeply marked the history of Rome: as Livy reports, after the disastrous battle of Cannae, the Senate met to assess the situation &quot;ad portam Capenam&quot;, which was one of the three meeting places of the assembly.

The procession that introduced in Rome the goddess Cybele (the &quot;Magna Mater&quot;), which was one of the first representatives of foreign cults and rites later culminated with the affirmation of Christianity, also passed through Porta Capena.

===Decline and destruction===
According to Juvenal, in the 1st century A.D., the area of Porta Capena had lost its historical and legendary importance and had become a meeting place for beggars, especially those of the Jewish religion.
The last use of the gate was as a supporting arch for the passage of the Aqua Marcia aqueduct.

Porta Capena was destroyed and the entire area restructured by Emperor Caracalla; the access to Rome was later transferred a little further on, through the new Porta Appia which opened into the Aurelian Wall. Its remains, while no longer visible today, were traced during the excavations carried out in 1867.

==In popular culture==
*Porta Capena was featured as a location visited by the Cornelii family in the popular Latin textbook series, &quot;Ecce Romani&quot;.

===Cityscapes===
== Geography ==

Hamamatsu is southwest of Tokyo.

Hamamatsu consists of a flat plain and the Mikatahara Plateau in the south, and a mountainous area in the north. It is roughly bordered by Lake Hamana to the west, the Tenryū River to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the south.

=== Climate ===
The climate in southern Hamamatsu has a humid subtropical climate with cool to mild winters with little snowfall; however, it is windy in winter because of the dry monsoon called &quot;Enshū no Karakaze&quot;, which is unique to the region. The climate in northern Hamamatsu is much harsher because of foehn winds. Summer is hot with the highest temperature often exceeds 35 degrees in the Tenryu-ku area, while it snows in winter.


=== Demographics ===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hamamatsu has been increasing over the past 70 years.
====Foreign population====

Hamamatsu has a significant non-Japanese population. The population of Nikkei foreigners, especially Brazilians, increased after a 1990 change in Japanese immigration law allowed them to work in Japan. At one point, Hamamatsu had the largest Brazilian Nikkei population of any Japanese city. Many foreigners work in the manufacturing sector, taking temporary jobs in Honda, Suzuki, and Yamaha plants. the number of non-Japanese in Hamamatsu was 33,332, and by 2010 the number exceeded 30,000. The city has a lot of Portuguese signage. It includes a Brazilian school, and many businesses catering to Brazilians display Brazilian flags. However, Natsuko Fukue of &quot;The Japan Times&quot; wrote in 2010 that many foreign children have difficulty integrating to society in Hamamatsu because &quot;Japanese and foreign communities live largely separate from one another.&quot;

The foreign population dropped significantly in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, with the Hamamatsu city government offering aid for some foreign nationals to return to their home countries. The foreign population was estimated as 25,084 as of August 1, 2019, per official city statistics.

==== Reorganization ====
On 1 January 2024, the number of wards will be reduced from seven to three as part of a municipal reorganization.

The reorganization was initially approved by a referendum held on April 7, 2019.

There is one senior high school operated by the city government: Hamamatsu Municipal Senior High School

Elementary and junior high schools are operated by the city government. , the city had 117 public elementary schools and 52 public junior high schools.

=== Multicultural education ===
The city has the following Brazilian international schools:
* Escola Brasil (former Escola Brasileira de Hamamatsu) – Primary and secondary school
* Escola Alegria de Saber – Primary and secondary school
* Escola Alcance – Primary school

It has one combined Peruvian school (ペルー学校) and Brazilian primary school, Mundo de Alegría.

The city formerly hosted other Brazilian schools, Colégio Pitágoras Brasil and Escola Cantinho Feliz.

As of May 1, 2009, the municipal elementary and junior high schools had 1,638 non-Japanese students. , there were 932 Brazilians enrolled in Hamamatsu&#x27;s municipal elementary and junior high schools: 646 Brazilians were enrolled in 61 public elementary schools, and 286 Brazilians were enrolled in 38 public junior high schools.

Within public schools Brazilian students have the same academic programs and take the same classes as Japanese nationals. Special teachers and assistants work with foreign students at municipal elementary and junior high schools with significant numbers of non-Japanese enrolled. In particular the schools use their part-time interpreters to assist Brazilian students. The interpreters are not formal teachers, yet Tsutsumi Angela Aparecida of Hamamatsu&#x27;s Burajiru Fureai Kai wrote that &quot;[t]heir assistance 
has become very useful&quot;. Toshiko Sugino of the National Defense Academy of Japan wrote that the municipal and prefectural schools in Hamamatsu &quot;follow traditional views of education and enforce rigid school rules&quot; despite the reputation of open-mindedness in the residents of Hamamatsu, causing some foreigners to send their non-Japanese children to foreign private schools.

As of 2008, many Brazilian parents have difficulty in deciding whether to send their children to Japanese schools or Brazilian schools, and it is common for Brazilian children attending Japanese schools to switch to a Brazilian school and vice versa. By 2010, many Brazilian parents had lost their jobs due to an economic decline, and many were unable to afford the Brazilian school monthly tuitions of ¥30,000 to ¥40,000.

As of 2010, about 50% of Brazilians of high school age in Hamamatsu do not attend high school. The inability to afford high school and difficulty with Japanese resulted in lower high school attendance rates. Hamamatsu NPO Network Center has made efforts to increase school attendance.

In Hamamatsu volunteers and a non-profit organization have established Japanese-language classes and native language classes for foreign children.

== History ==
Mishima is an ancient town, which developed around the important Shinto shrine of . Under the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; administration system established in the Nara period, Mishima was made capital of Izu Province. It was also the location of the &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; for Izu Province. In the Edo period, Mishima prospered from its location on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto, and Mishima-shuku was one of the 53 post stations on that road. The area was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory ruled by a &quot;daikan&quot; appointed directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, Mishima became part of the short-lived Nirayama Prefecture in 1868. This merged with the equally short-lived Ashigara Prefecture in 1871, and became part of Shizuoka Prefecture from 18 April 1876. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system of 1889, the area was reorganized as Mishima Town within Kimisawa District. In 1892, Prince Komatsu Akihito established a villa in Mishima. Its gardens, the &quot;Rakujūen&quot;, are a noted visitor attraction in Mishima to this day. In 1896, Kimisawa District became part of Tagata District, Shizuoka. Mishima received its first train connection in 1898 when the predecessor of the Izuhakone Railway established what is now Shimo-Togari Station. The Sunzu Line began operations from 1906. However, Mishima&#x27;s fortunes revived strongly only after the Tanna Tunnel was completed in 1934, connecting the town to the Tōkaidō Main Line railway between Tokyo and Shizuoka. Mishima developed rapidly afterwards, merging with neighboring Kitakami Village in 1935 and Watada Village in 1941. Mishima Town was elevated in status to a city on 29 April 1941. It became a stop on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen from 1969, leading to an expansion in population, as the line made it possible to commute to Tokyo.

<doc id="328991" wikidata="Q496072" url="?curid=328991" title="Fujinomiya, Shizuoka">
<text>is a city located in central Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 132,507 in 56,655 households, and a population density of 340 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==History==
The city name comes from the former shrine name of Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, &quot;Fujinomiya&quot;. It is an ancient settlement that developed as a prosperous &quot;toriimae-machi&quot; (town in front of torii) of Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, where the Fuji clan served as the high priest of the shrine. Nearby is the sanctuary of Taiseki-ji temple, founded in 1290 by Nikkō Shōnin as the headquarters of Nichiren Shōshū Buddhism.

Fujinomiya is closely related to Mount Fuji, and was located in the crossroad of Ōmiya and Murayamaguchi mountain pilgrimage trails. During the Kamakura period, the hunting event Fuji no Makigari arranged by shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo was held in the ancient region of Fujino, where the Revenge of the Soga Brothers incident also took place. These events were disseminated as historical materials such as &quot;Ōrai Mono&quot; (historical primary education textbooks created mainly in the form of letters), and as the subject of entertainment such as kabuki, noh, and &quot;jōruri&quot;.

Fujinomiya was a post town (fortified during the Sengoku period) on the primary route connecting Suruga with Kai Province. During the Edo period, the area was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate. British consul Sir Rutherford Alcock made the first recorded ascent on Mount Fuji by a non-Japanese person from Fujinomiya in 1860. During the cadastral reform of the early Meiji period in 1889, the area was reorganized into Omiya Town and eight villages with Fuji District, Shizuoka.

On 1 June 1942, the modern city was established with the merger of Omiya town with neighboring Fujioka village. The city expanded by annexing neighboring Fujine village in 1955, and Kitayama, Shiraito, Kamiide and Ueno villages in 1956.

The most recent merger was on 23 March 2010, when the town of Shibakawa (from Fuji District) was merged into Fujinomiya.

==History==
During the Edo period, all of Izu Province was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate, and the area now comprising Itō was occupied by 15 small farming and fishing hamlets. It was in this area that the Tokugawa shogunate ordered Englishman William Adams to construct Japan&#x27;s first western-style sailing vessels in 1604. The first ship, an 80-ton vessel, was used for surveying work, and the second ship, the 120-ton &quot;San Buena Ventura&quot; was sailed to Mexico. The period is commemorated in Itō by a street named after Adams (&quot;Anjinmiuradori&quot;). The area was reorganized into four villages (Tsushima, Itō, Komuro and Usami) within Kamo District with the establishment of the modern municipalities system in the early Meiji period in 1889, and was transferred to Tagata District in 1896.

On January 1, 1906, the village of Itō was elevated to town status. The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused damage in Itō with a 5 meter high tsunami. Train services started in 1938. It annexed neighboring Komuro Village on August 10, 1947, and became the city of Itō. In 1950 Itō was proclaimed an &quot;International Tourism and Cultural City&quot; by the central government. It further expanded through annexation of neighboring Tsushima and Usami villages on April 1, 1955. Izu-Kōgen Station opened on December 10, 1961, which helped promote tourism to the local resort area.

===Climate===
The city has a climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Shimada is 15.7 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2142 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.2 °C.

==History==
Shimada (Kanaya) began as an outlying fortification to Kakegawa Castle erected by Yamauchi Kazutoyo in the Sengoku period to control the crossing of the Ōi River. In the Edo period, Kanaya-juku and Shimada-juku developed as post towns on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. The area was mostly &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate with a &quot;daikansho&quot; based at a &quot;Jinya&quot; located within Shimada-juku. As the Tokugawa shogunate forbade the construction of any bridge or establishment of a ferry service on the Ōi River for defensive purposes, travellers were often detained at either Shimada or Kanaya for days, sometimes weeks, waiting for the river levels to fall to fordable levels. The first bridge (the Hōrai Bridge) across the river connected these two towns in 1879, after the Meiji Restoration.

With the establishment of the modern municipalities system in the early Meiji period in 1889, Kanaya Town was created within Haibara District, and Shimada Town within Shida District. On April 16, 1889, the two towns were connected by rail, with the opening of Shimada Station on the Tōkaidō Main Line.

Shimada was elevated to city status on January 1, 1948. On January 1, 1955, it annexed neighboring Rokugō Village, Ōtsu Village, Daichō Village and a portion of Ikumi Village. On June 1, 1961, it further expanded through annexation of Hatsukura Village.

On May 1, 2005, the town of Kanaya (from Haibara District) was merged into Shimada.

On April 1, 2008, the town of Kawane (also from Haibara District) was also merged into Shimada.

On March 15, 2012, the city became the second municipality, after Tokyo, outside Tōhoku to accept debris from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami for disposal in the town&#x27;s incinerators. Other cities had been reluctant to accept debris from the disaster, in spite of being asked to help recovery efforts, because of fears that the debris were contaminated by radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

The city has a climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Yaizu is 16.3 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2176 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 27.0 °C, and lowest in January, at around 6.3 °C.

==History==
Yaizu is an ancient settlement, with Yaizu Shrine claiming to have been founded in the 5th century during the Kofun period, and numerous kofun tumuli are found within the city limits. During the Edo period, Yaizu developed as a port under Tanaka Domain, and fish from Yaizu was frequently supplied to the retired &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu at nearby Sunpu Castle. In the October 1, 1886, establishment of the modern municipalities system after the Meiji Restoration, Yaizu Village was established within Mashizu District, Shizuoka prefecture. Mashizu District merged into neighboring Shida District in 1896. The following year, in 1897, author Lafcadio Hearn began his residence in Yaizu.

Yaizu was elevated to town status on June 28, 1901. Yaizu Fishing Cooperative was established in 1903, and started to take frozen catch from Yaizu to Tokyo&#x27;s Tsukiji fish market from 1908. Shipbuilding facilities, primarily for the production of fishing vessels, was established in 1924. The Yaizu Fishing Cooperative began the first wireless communication with its fishing fleet in Japan in 1925, but overfishing soon led to collapse of bonito stocks in 1926, resulting in a five-year fishing moratorium. After the start of World War II, the Yaizu fishing industry was again hit hard by the requisition of entire Yaizu fishing fleet (113 vessels) and crewmen by Imperial Japanese Navy in 1941. Only 10 vessels survived the war.

Yaizu was elevated to city status on March 1, 1951. On November 1, 1953, Toyota Village merged into Yaizu City. The city name gained international prominence over the Daigo Fukuryū Maru Incident, in which a Yaizu-based fishing vessel was irradiated by atomic testing at Bikini Atoll on March 1, 1954. The city further expanded on January 1, 1955, by annexation of the neighboring villages of Higashi Mashizu, Kogawa, Ōtomi, and Wada, and on April 1, 1957, when Hirohata Village was divided between Yaizu and Fujieda cities. Yaizu port underwent a major expansion in March 1968. The city was the site of the 2001 Japan Airlines mid-air incident on January 31, 2001.

On November 1, 2008, the town of Ōigawa (from Shida District) was merged into Yaizu.

==Government==
Atami has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 21 members. The city contributes three members to the Shizuoka Prefectural Assembly.

==Economy==
The economy of Yaizu is dominated by the commercial fishing industry. Yaizu Port was first in Japan in terms of tonnage of bonito and tuna in 2002, and third in terms of mackerel. Local industries are centered on food processing, including the production of &quot;katsuobushi&quot;, &quot;shiokara&quot;, &quot;tsukudani&quot;, and &quot;kamaboko&quot; (especially &quot;narutomaki&quot;). Agricultural products include green tea, melons, tangerines, and tomatoes. Yaizu is also the home of the Hasegawa plastic model kit manufacturing company. Yaizu is also home to one of Sapporo Brewery&#x27;s Largest factories, as well as the company&#x27;s new product development division.

<text>Wikibooks (previously called &quot;Wikimedia Free Textbook Project&quot; and &quot;Wikimedia-Textbooks&quot;) is a wiki-based Wikimedia project hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation for the creation of free content digital textbooks and annotated texts that anyone can edit.

Initially, the project was created solely in English in July 2003; a later expansion to include additional languages was started in July 2004. As of 2025, there are Wikibooks sites active for languages comprising a total of articles and recently active editors.

== History ==
The wikibooks.org domain was registered on July 19, 2003. It was launched to host and build free textbooks on subjects such as organic chemistry and physics, in response to a request by Wikipedia contributor Karl Wick. Two major sub-projects, Wikijunior and Wikiversity, were created within Wikibooks before its official policy was later changed so that future incubator-type projects are started according to the Wikimedia Foundation&#x27;s new project policy.

In August 2006, Wikiversity became an independent Wikimedia Foundation project.

Since 2008, Wikibooks has been included in BASE.

In June 2016, Compete.com estimated that Wikibooks had 1,478,812 unique visitors.

=== Wikijunior ===
Wikijunior is a subproject of Wikibooks that specializes in books for children. The project consists of both a magazine and a website, and is currently being developed in English, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic and Bangla. It is funded by a grant from the Beck Foundation.

== Book content ==

While some books are original, others began as text copied over from other sources of free content textbooks found on the Internet. All of the site&#x27;s content is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license (or a compatible license). This means that, as with its sister project, Wikipedia, contributions remain copyrighted to their creators, while the licensing ensures that it can be freely distributed and reused subject to certain conditions.
Wikibooks differs from Wikisource in that Wikisource collects exact copies and original translations of existing free content works, such as the original text of Shakespearean plays, while Wikibooks is dedicated either to original works, significantly altered versions of existing works, or annotations to original works.

== Multilingual statistics ==
As of 2025, there are Wikibooks sites for languages of which are active and are closed. The active sites have articles and the closed sites have articles. There are registered users of which are recently active.

The top ten Wikibooks language projects by mainspace article count:

For a complete list with totals, see Wikimedia Statistics.

== Reception ==
Meng-Fen et al suggested that while there isn&#x27;t much social connection between contributors of wikibooks, the contributors had no major issues coordinating to write books.

<doc id="329008" wikidata="Q823988" url="?curid=329008" title="Kakegawa, Shizuoka">
<text>is a city in western Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 117,925 in 45,519 households. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Kakegawa is in the coastal plains of southwest Shizuoka Prefecture. It is bordered to the south by the Pacific Ocean, and extends for approximately 30 kilometers north-south by 16 kilometers east-west.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Shizuoka Prefecture
**Fukuroi
**Kikugawa
**Mori
**Omaezaki
**Shimada

==Demographics==
Like most of Japan, Kakegawa&#x27;s population is almost exclusively Japanese. However, Kakegawa has a noticeable &quot;Nikkei&quot; (particularly, South American) population and it is more common to find signs written in Portuguese than in English.

Per Japanese census data, the population of Kakegawa has been increasing over the past 50 years.

===Climate===
The city has a climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Kakegawa is 16.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2100 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 27.1 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.8 °C.

==History==
The Kakegawa area has been regional commercial center within Tōtōmi Province since at least the Kamakura period, but developed as a castle town under the Imagawa clan, whose headquarters was in neighboring Suruga Province. Kakegawa Castle was built by Asahina Yasuhiro, a retainer of Imagawa Yoshitada, in the Bunmei era (1469–1487). The castle later fell into the hands of the Tokugawa clan, but was then given to Toyotomi clan retainer Yamauchi Kazutoyo in 1580. After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Kakegawa Domain was created, and ruled by numerous &quot;fudai&quot; daimyō. The area prospered during the Edo period, as the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto passed through Kakegawa, whose post stations included Nissaka-shuku and Kakegawa-juku. Neighboring Yokosuka Domain, a smaller &quot;fudai&quot; holding, was also located within what are now the city limits of Kakegawa.

After the Meiji Restoration, Kakegawa was made part of the short-lived Hamamatsu Prefecture in 1871, which merged with Shizuoka Prefecture in 1876. Kakegawa Town was created in the cadastral reform of April, 1891, four years after the opening of Kakegawa Station on what later became the Tōkaidō Main Line railway. The town expanded steadily over the years, annexing neighboring villages and towns in Ogasa District, and was elevated in status of that of a city in 1954.

On April 1, 2005, the towns of Daitō and Ōsuka (both from Ogasa District) were merged into Kakegawa.

==Government==
Kakegawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 30 members.

The city is surrounded by green tea fields and is known for its high quality tea. Other crops include cantaloupe, tomatoes, strawberries and roses. In terms of industrial production, Kakegawa has several light industry industrial complexes. Major products include telecommunications equipment and electronics, cosmetics, automotive components and musical instruments.

<text>St. Albert is a city in Alberta, Canada, next to the Sturgeon River, northwest of the City of Edmonton, the provincial capital. It was originally settled as a Métis community, and is now the second-largest city in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. St. Albert first received its town status in 1904 and was reached by the Canadian Northern Railway in 1906. Originally separated from Edmonton by several miles of farmland, the 1980s expansion of Edmonton&#x27;s city limits placed St. Albert immediately adjacent to the larger city on St. Albert&#x27;s southern and eastern sides.

== History ==
St. Albert was founded in 1861 as a Métis settlement by Father Albert Lacombe, OMI, who built a small chapel, the Father Lacombe Chapel, in the Sturgeon River valley. The chapel still stands to this day on Mission Hill in St. Albert. The original settlement was named Saint Albert by Bishop Alexandre-Antonin Taché, OMI, after Lacombe&#x27;s name saint, Saint Albert of Louvain. Originally, although Lacombe had intended to found the mission at Lac Ste. Anne, the soil proved infertile, thus he moved the settlement to what would become St. Albert. This location offered several advantages, notably its easy access to supplies of wood and water, in addition to its excellent soil, it being a regular stopping-point for First Nations peoples on their travels, and its proximity to Fort Edmonton, where the priests could purchase necessary supplies and minister to Catholic workers. A few years later, a group of Grey Nuns would follow Lacombe from Lac Ste. Anne. More Métis from Lac Ste. Anne arrived in 1863 and, by December 1864, the population was roughly 300. In 1870, localised outbreaks of smallpox had spread northward into St. Albert, killing 320 of the area&#x27;s then-900 residents.

St. Albert was previously the site of two Indian residential schools as part of the Canadian Residential School System. The St. Albert Indian Residential School (&quot;Youville&quot;) was located on Mission Hill within the St. Albert city limits and was operated by the Roman Catholic Church from October 22, 1873, to June 30, 1948, after being relocated from the Lac Ste. Anne Mission, the site of its original founding. The Edmonton Indian Residential School (&quot;Poundmaker&quot;) was located approximately 6 km east of St. Albert&#x27;s current downtown area, and was operated by the Methodist Church from March 1, 1924, to June 30, 1968, later becoming the home of the Poundmaker Lodge rehabilitation centre. Between the two schools, 53 students are known to have died under unknown or dubious circumstances while in attendance. A healing garden, named Kâkesimokamik, was opened on September 15, 2017, as part of the truth-and-reconciliation process between the city of St. Albert and survivors (and their descendants) of the residential school system.

During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it was mistakenly assumed that the community had been named after St. Albert the Great, due to incorrectly-printed information in the 1985 history of St. Albert, &quot;The Black Robe&#x27;s Vision&quot;, published by amateur historians of the St. Albert Historical Society. This led to the City of St. Albert erroneously promoting St. Albert the Great as the community&#x27;s &quot;patron saint&quot;, even erecting a statue of the incorrect saint in the downtown area. However, the misconception was not corrected until 2008. The original chapel has since become an historic site, staffed with historical interpreters, and is open to the public during the summer season.

Also located in St. Albert is the St. Albert Grain Elevator Park, featuring two historic grain elevators; the original grain elevator was constructed in 1906 by the Brackman-Ker Milling Company, with the other being built later, in 1929, by The Alberta Wheat Pool company. The original 1906 elevator was originally red in colour, but has faded with time to a metallic silver. There is also a reproduction of the original 1909 railway station housed at Grain Elevator Park, erected in 2005. On Madonna Drive stands the Little White School House, which is open to the public. Arts and Heritage – St. Albert maintains the site, as well as the Grain Elevators and other heritage buildings, in addition to other sites under-restoration in the city. In June 2009, the City Council approved a multi-staged plan for the heritage sites, featuring the restoration of the grain elevators and the opening of both a Métis and French Canadian farm on adjacent lots by the River.

; Facilities
In September 2006, a $42.77-million multi-purpose leisure centre, Servus Credit Union Place, was built. It features a recreational aquatic centre, a kid&#x27;s play area, the Troy Murray, Mark Messier and Go Auto Arenas, two indoor soccer/lacrosse fields, three basketball courts, a large exercise room, and a running track among other amenities. Construction of the facility, touted as an eventual break-even operation, was approved via plebiscite during the 2004 municipal election.

Servus Credit Union Place served as an expansion of the original Campbell Twin Arenas, which housed the Mark Messier and Troy Murray hockey rinks built in 1992, named for those two local National Hockey League (NHL) players. There was some controversy in 2006 when the city announced that they would rename the two existing rinks, and were going to offer those naming rights for sale. Following coverage of the controversy surfacing in Sports Illustrated, then mayor Paul Chalifoux decided to repeal the decision. The twin arenas were upgraded concurrent with the construction of Servus Credit Union Place.

A smaller pair of ice hockey arenas, the Kinex and Akinsdale arenas, were opened side by side in 1982 in the Akinsdale neighbourhood. The Akinsdale Arena served as the city&#x27;s main arena until the opening of the Campbell Twin Arenas. In August 2019, a ceremony was held renaming Akinsdale Arena after retired NHL star Jarome Iginla, who played his minor hockey in St. Albert until leaving to the Western Hockey League as a 16-year-old.

There is also Fountain Park pool and Grosvenor pool, both offering a variety of pools, tennis courts, racketball courts and child play areas.

Between 1977 and 2004, it was home to the St. Albert Saints, which produced players such as Mark Messier and Mike Comrie. The team moved to Spruce Grove in 2004, becoming the Spruce Grove Saints. In 2007, the AJHL returned to St. Albert when the Fort Saskatchewan Traders relocated to the city, becoming the St. Albert Steel. Playing out of Servus Credit Union Place, the team lasted five seasons before moving to Whitecourt in 2012, becoming the Whitecourt Wolverines.

NHL ice hockey player Jarome Iginla is from St. Albert. He played his entire minor hockey career in the St. Albert Minor Hockey Association, which included stints with the Bantam AAA Sabres and the Midget AAA Raiders. It was during the 1992–93 season with the Raiders that Iginla, then an under-age midget player, scored 87 points to lead the Alberta Midget AAA Hockey league in scoring. Following this season Iginla joined the Kamloops Blazers as a 16-year-old.

The bilingual &quot;St. Albert Star&quot;, or &quot;Étoile de St. Albert,&quot; was started in 1912, and offered issues in both English and French. The two versions of the paper would often carry unique stories that the other did not. In 1914, &quot;The Star&quot; ceased printing, and &quot;Le Progrès&quot; relocated to Edmonton.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1949 that the next newspaper began publishing, which saw the first issue by the &quot;St. Albert Gazette&quot;. That version of the newspaper merged with the &quot;Morinville Journal&quot; in 1953. In 1961 a new newspaper with the same name was started. That version has undergone a number of name changes through the years, but is the one that exists today.

In 1998, the &quot;Saint City News&quot; was founded, operating as the &quot;Gazette&#x27;s&quot; major competitor for 13 years until it closed in 2011.

Also in 2011, the &quot;St. Albert Leader&quot; was started. It was distributed for a short time, but stopped printing in 2015.

The long form monthly magazine &quot;T8N&quot; began distribution in 2014, and covers topics about the city and its people.

=== Radio ===

The first radio station in St. Albert came in 1978. The oldies station CKST Radio broadcast on frequency 1070 AM until it changed its callsign to CFMG in 1988. It was at this point that it began broadcasting on the 1200 AM frequency. The station would make another change in 1995, branding itself with the name EZ Rock. The change also saw the station move from AM radio to FM, broadcasting on 104.9 FM. The station was sold to Astral Media in 2007.

St. Albert lost the radio station after its most recent change in 2011, when it moved to Edmonton after changing formats from adult contemporary to top 40, becoming 104.9 Virgin Radio.

Due to the city&#x27;s adjacency to Edmonton, all major Edmonton media—newspapers, television, and radio—also serve St. Albert.

==Transport==

===Air===

The nearest airport providing passenger service is the Edmonton International Airport. Local air services are provided by the St. Albert Heliport to the northwest of the city and Villeneuve Airport to the west, while Sturgeon Community Hospital has a helipad to receive and transfer patients.

=== Public transit ===
The city runs St. Albert Transit (StAT) a public transport agency. It runs 21 local routes and 7 commuter routes to Edmonton. Village Transit Station is located at Gate Avenue and Grange Drive. St. Albert Exchange is located at Rivercrest Crescent and St. Vital Avenue. The Metro Line in Edmonton could be extended to St. Albert with four stations within city limits.

== History ==


Gotemba was the location of the earliest known settlement founded in the region of Shizuoka which dates back 2,000 years ago. The inhabitants of the area (including Gotemba) were not ethnically Yamato and were likely Ainu.

Gotemba was the site of a &quot;shōen&quot; belonging to Ise Shrine in the Heian period. During the Edo period the area was part of Odawara Domain. After the start of the Meiji period, it became part of Shizuoka Domain until the abolition of the han system in 1871 and the establishment of Shizuoka Prefecture. The opening of Gotemba Station on what was then the Tōkaidō Main Line on February 1, 1889, spurred development of the area. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, Gotemba Town was created within Suntō District, along with Fujioka Village, Harasato Village, Ino Village, Tamaho Village, and Takane Village.

However, the opening of the Tanna Tunnel on December 1, 1934, resulted in the route of Tōkaidō Main Line shifting south to Atami, leaving Gotemba on the spur Gotemba Line, which resulted in temporary depopulation. During the pre-war era, Gotemba was a major base area for the Imperial Japanese Army, and still houses military facilities and a large training area (the East Fuji Maneuver Area) for the modern Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force and the United States Marine Corps.

Gotemba was elevated to city status on February 11, 1955, through the merger of Gotemba Town with neighboring Fujioka Village, Harasato Village, Ino Village, and Tamaho Village. The city expanded through annexation of Takane Village on January 1, 1956 and the Furusawa District of Oyama Town on September 1, 1957. The Gotemba Interchange on the Tōmei Expressway was completed on May 25, 1969.

==Government==
Gotemba has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 21 members.

==Economy==
Gotemba has a mixed economy. Agriculture has traditionally been dominated by rice, irrigated by water from Mount Fuji, and has been supplemented by the growing of various green vegetables and the raising of pigs. Development of light industries, especially in food processing and electronics has profited through Gotemba&#x27;s location on the Tōmei Expressway, and Gotemba is noted for a number of golf courses and a spacious outlet shopping center.

Retailing company Chelsea Japan rented former Gotemba Family Land Amusement Park, and officially opened in July 2000 as Gotemba Premium Outlets.

<doc id="329019" wikidata="Q643326" url="?curid=329019" title="Port Coquitlam">
<text>Port Coquitlam ( ) is a city in British Columbia, Canada. It is one of 21 municipalities comprising Metro Vancouver. Located east of Vancouver, it is on the north bank of the confluence of the Fraser River and the Pitt River. Coquitlam borders it to the north and west. Pitt Meadows lies across the Pitt River from it. Port Coquitlam is bisected by Lougheed Highway and the Canadian Pacific Kansas City railway. Port Coquitlam is often referred to as &quot;PoCo&quot;. It is Canada&#x27;s 93rd-largest municipality by population.

==History==

The area was long inhabited by indigenous peoples, most recently by the Coast Salish people, including the &quot;Kwikwetl&#x27;em&quot;. The first European settlers began farming beside the Pitt River in 1859. A major impetus to the creation of a municipality was when the Canadian Pacific Railway moved its freight terminus from Vancouver to &quot;Westminster Junction&quot;, building a spur line to the Fraser River port of New Westminster in 1911. Port Coquitlam was first incorporated as a municipality on March 7, 1913.

Port Coquitlam was originally developed mostly as farmland. Given the expansion and increasing density of Vancouver, it has now been developed for suburban housing, especially in the northern and southwestern areas of the city. The economy is diversified, with a variety of industrial and commercial developments, including metal fabrication, high technology industries, and transportation.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Port Coquitlam had a population of 61,498 living in 22,884 of its 23,671 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 58,612. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

During the second half of the 1990s, the population grew at a rate of 9.8%, spurred by numerous immigrants. By 2001 they comprised 25% of the population. English was the first language for 76% of the inhabitants.

In 2009, Port Coquitlam was rated 85th for its murder rate (for Canadian cities with a population over 50K).

=== Ethnicity ===

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

=== Languages ===
The 2021 census found that English was spoken as mother tongue by 62.4% of the population. Chinese languages made up the next largest first language category. Chinese languages were the mother tongues of 8.2% of residents, including 4.5% Cantonese and 3.4% Mandarin. Other common first languages were Persian (3.0%), Korean (2.6%), and Tagalog (2.4%). As a single response, French was the first language of 0.9% of the population. 3.5% of residents listed both English and a non-official language as mother tongues, while 0.4% listed both English and French.


=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Port Coquitlam include:
*Irreligion (29,825 persons or 49.4%)
*Christianity (23,980 persons or 39.7%)
*Islam (2,590 persons or 4.3%)
*Sikhism (1,335 persons or 2.2%)
*Buddhism (855 persons or 1.4%)
*Hinduism (755 persons or 1.3%)
*Judaism (300 persons or 0.5%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (45 persons or 0.1%)

==Transportation==
Being primarily suburban, Port Coquitlam relies heavily on its vehicular roads to move people and goods. For example, two of its major arterial roads, Shaughnessy Street and Lougheed Highway bisect Port Coquitlam north to south and east to west, respectively.

TransLink provides a number of bus routes throughout the city. The most used bus routes in this section of the Metro Vancouver Regional District are the 159, which connects southern Port Coquitlam to SkyTrain at Braid station. Other bus routes in the city include the 160, which links Port Coquitlam with Vancouver via Coquitlam Central Station and Moody Centre station, and the 173/174, which runs a loop through the northern half of the city, linking it with regional buses at Coquitlam Central and Port Coquitlam station. Two major stops in the city include Port Coquitlam Centre and Port Coquitlam Station. The remainder of Port Coquitlam is served by a network of Community Shuttles.

Port Coquitlam is the only one of the Tri-Cities to not have SkyTrain. However, this may change in the future with a Millennium Line extension into the downtown area. When the Evergreen Extension was built, the first few metres of track and a track switch to allow for an eventual eastward extension to Port Coquitlam were built at Coquitlam Central station. This would create two branches where trains would alternate between going north to Lafarge Lake–Douglas or east to downtown Port Coquitlam. A feasibility study was conducted, started during early 2020 and running for about six months. Both Mayor Brad West, the Port Coquitlam City Council, and the Coquitlam City Council have voiced support for the extension. However, as of 2022, no funding had been secured nor a formal plan created.

The Lougheed Highway passes through Port Coquitlam, running from Coquitlam in the west to the Pitt River Bridge in the east. Although this highway has made much of Port Coquitlam a very congested area, it is one of the few major arterial highways in the area.

The Mary Hill Bypass, officially known as Highway 7B, runs adjacent to the Fraser River from the Pitt River Bridge on the east to the Port Mann Bridge on the west.

The Canadian Pacific Kansas City has a major rail yard in the central sector of the city.

In October 2009, the new Pitt River Bridge, a new seven-lane cable-stayed bridge, opened to the public replacing the existing crossing. The previous crossing was made up of 2 swing bridges, which were removed upon completion of the new bridge. The Pitt River Bridge crosses the Pitt River, connecting Port Coquitlam to neighbouring Pitt Meadows.

In March 2010, the Coast Meridian Overpass, a new four-lane cable-stayed bridge, opened to give a new option for traveling north to south over the Canadian Pacific Railway Oxford Street rail yard.

A hiking and biking trail, known as the Traboulay PoCo Trail, completely surrounds the city.

In August 2018, U-bicycle launched a dockless bicycle sharing system in the city.

<text>The Myers Motors NmG (formerly the Corbin Sparrow) is a single-passenger, three-wheeled, battery electric vehicle designed specifically for commuting and city driving, produced from 1999 into the early 2010s. It was initially produced by Corbin Motors, and made to order after 2005 by Myers Motors. It is a personal electric vehicle (PEV).

==Description==
The Sparrow is powered by a 20 kW (continuous) 156-volt DC or 3-phase AC electric motor and has a range of and a top speed of . Fuel efficiency is approximately 130 W·h/km (4.8 mi/(kW·h), which is equivalent to 162 mpg (US) or 194 mpg (UK) (1.45 L/100 km) using the DOE conversion.

Two models were produced: the original &quot;jelly bean&quot; model and then a hatchback model, which was nicknamed &quot;pizza butt&quot; because it was designed for use by Domino&#x27;s Pizza. Several Sparrows were featured in the feature films &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; and &quot;Looper&quot;.

In June 2008, the website listed a price of $29,995 without taxes or shipping. In 2009, the NmG began to use lithium batteries which Myers Motors claims doubled its driving range to between charges.

In February 2013, the NmG disappeared from the Myer Motors &quot;Buy your NmG&quot; page on their website, replaced by the 2 seat Duo.

<text>Árpád Göncz (; 10 February 1922 – 6 October 2015) was a Hungarian writer, translator, lawyer and liberal politician who served as President of Hungary from 2 May 1990 to 4 August 2000. Göncz played a role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, for which he was imprisoned for six years. After his release, he worked as a translator of English-language literary works.

He was also a founding member of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) and Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary (&quot;de facto&quot; head of state) before becoming president. He was Hungary&#x27;s first freely elected head of state, as well as the first in 42 years who was not a communist or a fellow traveller.

He was a member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

==Biography==

===Early life (1922–1945)===
Árpád Göncz was born on 10 February 1922 in Budapest into a petty bourgeois family of noble origin as the son of Lajos Göncz de Gönc (1887–1974), who worked as a post officer, and Ilona Haimann (b. 1892). The Roman Catholic Göncz family originated from Csáktornya, Zala County (today Čakovec, Croatia), where Göncz&#x27;s great-grandfather, Lajos Göncz Sr. was a pharmacist. He later participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and following the defeat, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. Árpád Göncz&#x27;s father, Lajos Göncz was also a successful tennis player, who participated in the 1924 Summer Olympics, where he was defeated by René Lacoste in men&#x27;s singles in the second round. Árpád Göncz&#x27;s parents divorced when he was six years old, thus his relationship with his father became tense in the following years. Göncz&#x27;s mother, who was a Unitarian, was born in Transylvania, she had Jewish and Székely roots. She became an orphan as a child and after a brief spell in an orphanage, she was raised by the merchant Báthy family from Budapest.

After finishing four-grade elementary school, Göncz began his secondary studies at the Werbőczy Secondary Grammar School in 1932. There he involved himself in the activity of the Hungarian Scout Association. Scouting opened Göncz&#x27;s eyes to social issues, particularly with regard to the problems of the poor peasantry, as he said in a later interview. Göncz joined the Pál Teleki Work Group which was formed in 1936 by Pál Teleki, an influential interwar politician and Prime Minister of Hungary, also Hungary&#x27;s Chief Scout. The work group was an important seminary and forum for the university students. The programme emphasized the relevance of the nation, family and community and the good knowledge of Hungarian history and geography. In the next years, key figures from the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party, e.g. Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky, had joined the work group. His political view was also influenced by the &quot;népi-nemzeti&quot; (&quot;rural-national&quot;) ideological movement since the 1930s. The group of the so-called &quot;folk writers&quot; (), including Zsigmond Móricz or János Kodolányi, expressed critique of capitalism and emphasis on peasant society and land reform. Göncz also stressed he represented the same political view as liberal political theorist István Bibó. In December 1938, Göncz, in a short essay in &quot;Magyar Cserkész&quot; (&quot;Hungarian Scout&quot;), welcomed the Hungarians&#x27; entry into Komárno in accordance with the First Vienna Award.

Göncz graduated in law from the Budapest Pázmány Péter University of Arts and Sciences in 1944. During his academic years, he was exempted from conscription in the Second World War. Meanwhile, Hungary was occupied by Germany on 19 March 1944. In December, Göncz was conscripted into the 25th Reserve Mountain Infantry Battalion of the Royal Hungarian Army and ordered to Germany; however, he deserted and joined the resistance movement. In late 1944, Göncz found himself in Budapest when the Red Army encircled the Hungarian capital, beginning the Siege of Budapest. The resistance Hungarian Front formed to oppose the Nazi regime with several regional branches, including the Freedom Front of Hungarian Students (MDSZ) which established officially on 7 November 1944, during the Arrow Cross Party government. Göncz joined the Táncsics Battalion in December 1944, where he took part in partisan actions against the Arrow Cross regime in Budapest. After the war he went on to study agricultural science.

===Early political career and retreat (1945–1956)===

Following the Soviet occupation of Hungary, Göncz joined the anti-communist Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party (FKGP), which won a sweeping victory (57.03%) in the November 1945 parliamentary election, however the party had to yield to Marshal Kliment Voroshilov (Chairman of the Allied Control Commission), who made it clear that a grand coalition in which the Communists preserved the gains already secured (that is, the Ministry of the Interior and control over the police) was the only kind of government acceptable to the Soviets. Göncz refused to run as an individual parliamentary candidate, because he did not feel ready for becoming MP. Instead he served as the personal assistant of Béla Kovács, the General Secretary of the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party, who was responsible for running the party machine. Göncz later called his job as an &quot;unpleasant time in his life&quot; due to the nature of the function, nevertheless he admired and respected Kovács and remembered him as a &quot;statesman&quot; in a later interview.

Beside his secretary position, Göncz also edited weekly party newspaper &quot;Nemzedék&quot; (&quot;Generation&quot;). He also served as leader of the party&#x27;s youth organization in Budapest for a time. Over the next two years, the Communists (MKP) pressured the Smallholders&#x27; Party into expelling their more courageous members as &quot;fascists&quot; and fascist sympathizers as part of Communist leader Mátyás Rákosi&#x27;s &quot;salami tactics&quot;. On 25 February 1947, Béla Kovács was arrested unlawfully and taken to the Soviet Union without a trial in Hungary. Following that Göncz was also arrested in conjunction with a visit to Romania in late 1946, where he had negotiated with ethnic Hungarian politicians. He was detained and interrogated for three weeks before release.

By the 1949 parliamentary election, the FKGP was absorbed into the Hungarian Independent People&#x27;s Front (MFNF), led by the communists, and Göncz became unemployed. After that, he worked as a manual labourer (welder metalsmith and pipe fitter) and also enrolled in a correspondence course of the Gödöllő Agricultural University, where he specialised in soil erosion and protection. Göncz then used his knowledge working as
an agronomist at the Talajjavító Vállalat (Soil Improvement Co.) until the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 against the communist rule.

===1956 Revolution and aftermath (1956–1957)===
Göncz played an active role in the work of the newly formed Petőfi Circle (), which established by reformist intellectuals under the auspices of the Union of Working Youth (DISZ), mass youth organization wing of the ruling communist Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (MDP), in March 1955. The circle held twelve meetings in the first half of 1956. As an agronomist, Göncz expressed his opinion on the Soviet agricultural model during one of the forums. On 17 October 1956, he participated in an agricultural debate (&quot;Kert-Magyarország?&quot;) at the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences. There he criticized again the Soviet model considered unsuitable for the Hungarian conditions. Göncz also lay emphasis on free peasant education.

In a June 1995 speech, Göncz recalled the 1956 events as a &quot;turning point&quot; in his life which determined his fate until the end of his life, despite the fact that he did not participate in the armed resistance and uprising. On 23 October 1956, he was present at the peaceful mass demonstration, which marched in front of the Hungarian Parliament Building, along with his eldest daughter Kinga, who was nine years old at that time. Göncz&#x27;s role in the October 1956 events remained fragmented. By 29 October 1956, he assumed a political role in the events. He participated in a meeting at Prime Minister Imre Nagy&#x27;s house, when Nagy was informed about the Suez Crisis and the Prime Minister said &quot;Gentlemen! From now on, we need to discuss another thing because there is a dangerous possibility of a Third World War&quot;. Göncz worked as an activist in the newly recreated Hungarian Peasant Alliance during the revolution. In a 1985 interview, Göncz said he sympathized with the political vision of Imre Nagy. He also added, that he would join a Nagy-led Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP), if the Soviet intervention does not take place. Göncz noted the Nagy government and the new communist party would have started with a clean slate. Sociologist Péter Kende has said Göncz&#x27;s belief in &quot;democratic socialism&quot; was similar to that of István Bibó.

After the Soviet intervention on 4 November 1956, János Kádár established a pro-Soviet government. The Revolutionary Council of Hungarian Intellectuals, members were writers, journalists etc., issued statements of protest against the Soviet army&#x27;s invasion and appealed for help and mediation from the Western world. Göncz participated in the writing of several memoranda. One of the most influential writings was the &quot;Draft Proposal for a Compromise Solution to the Hungarian Question&quot; by intellectual István Bibó, who also served as Minister of State in the second and third government of Imre Nagy. Göncz took part in the debates on the proposal. Göncz had a good relationship with &quot;charge d&#x27;affaires&quot; Mohamed Ataur Rahman from the Indian Embassy in Budapest, thus he was also able to make contact with the Government of India who tried to mediate between the Hungarian and the Soviet governments following the revolution. Formerly, during the intense days, Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru expressed his sympathy and compassion towards the Hungarian freedom fighters, nevertheless India remained cautious and abstained in the UN General Assembly voting, which called on the Soviet Union to end its Hungarian intervention. As a result of the intercession of Göncz, the Indian government became more determined in the Hungarian issue. He handed over Bibó&#x27;s draft proposal to &quot;charge d&#x27;affaires&quot; Rahman in December 1956, however India&#x27;s mediation attempt ended in failure due to lack of interest in the Soviet Union.

Göncz also helped to transfer a manuscript of Imre Nagy (&quot;On Communism in Defense of New Course&quot;) abroad, through the assistance of László Regéczy-Nagy, driver to Christopher Lee Cope, head of the British Legation in Budapest. They hoped the manuscript might have helped to rescue Imre Nagy from show trial and execution. Cope forwarded the manuscript to the emigrant Hungarian Revolutionary Council in Strasbourg, and the document was translated into several languages for several countries, including Italy, France and West Germany. Before his arrest, Göncz was campaigning for the Hungarian Aid () movement. Göncz organized to donate the emigrant Hungarians&#x27; support for families in need of help.

===Prison years (1957–1963)===
He was arrested on 28 May 1957, along with István Bibó, on the order of Minister of the Interior Béla Biszku. In the forthcoming months, Bibó, Göncz and Regéczy-Nagy were interrogated, isolating from each other by the secret police in connection with their relationships with India and the Western block. Once the prosecutor said to Göncz that &quot;the traitor deserved to hang twice.&quot; Göncz and his inmates were charged with &quot;organizing the overthrow of the Hungarian people&#x27;s democratic state.&quot; Göncz was secretly tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of appeal on 2 August 1958, some weeks after the secret trial and execution of Imre Nagy. Later Göncz believed that he could avoid the capital punishment only due to Nehru&#x27;s intervention. Dae Soon Kim, Göncz&#x27;s biographer also argued it might be possible that the Indian premier&#x27; diplomatic efforts impacted on the severity of penalties regarding the Göncz and Bibó trials.

Göncz began his years in prison at Budapest Penitentiary and Jail (&quot;Gyűjtőfogház&quot;) in August 1958. He spent his punishment among hundreds of political prisoners, such as Tibor Déry, Zoltán Tildy, István Bibó and Imre Mécs. Göncz was isolated and separated from the outside world, visitors were permitted for only ten minutes in every six months and correspondence was allowed in every three months for the political prisoners. Later Göncz was transferred to the Vác prison.

In Vác, the conditions were freer; Göncz had spent the time learning to read and write English. The political prisoners were able to obtain literary works from the Western world, including the memoires of politicians Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle. According to György Litván, the senior party functionaries, who did not speak foreign languages, established a &quot;translation agency&quot; in the Vác prison to learn about the information available to Western public opinion. Göncz, beside political pamphlets, also translated John Galsworthy&#x27;s &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, transferring from the prison by Litván, which laid the foundation of his translation career after release. Imre Mécs said, a cohesive community of &#x27;56 democratic-minded generation emerged within the walls of the Vác prison, where there were constant political discussions and debates.

In 1960 he participated in the political prisoners&#x27; hunger strike of the Vác prison, because, despite the promises of Kádár, most of the oppositional intellectuals and freedom fighters were not pardoned, unlike former communist officials, who had significant role in building of the Stalinist dictatorship before 1956, such as Mihály Farkas and Gábor Péter. The government decided to separate the prisoners, Bibó and Göncz were transferred to Márianosztra, while Litván and journalist Sándor Fekete were sent back to the Gyűjtőfogház. Finally, János Kádár ordered a mass amnesty in March 1963 in exchange for his government&#x27;s international recognition by the United Nations. Along with more than 4000 other revolutionaries and freedom fighters, Göncz was released from prison under amnesty in July 1963, three months after István Bibó.

===Literary career (1963–1988)===
In the following decades, he worked as a specialized translator, translating over a hundred literary works, and a writer of English prose. Some of his notable translations include E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot;, Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Of Time and the River&quot;, William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;Sartoris&quot;, &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, the latter being referred by Göncz to as his &quot;greatest challenge.&quot;

His most famous translation work is J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Initially, art critic Ádám Réz began to translate &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, however after the translation of eleven chapters (texts and poems), the main terms and concepts, he stopped the work because of his increasingly severe illness. Réz died in 1978 and his manuscript remained unfinished for the next few years. Göncz later took over the project, working on the prose in Tolkien&#x27;s novel, while the poems and songs were translated by Dezső Tandori. Finally, the work was published by Gondolat Kiadó in 1981, for the first time in Hungary. In January 2002, Göncz was present at the Hungarian premiere of the movie adaptation of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

Göncz continued his career as a translator with many important works, including Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; and &quot;A Fable&quot;, Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;, William Styron&#x27;s &quot;Lie Down in Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;, John Ball&#x27;s &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, Colleen McCullough&#x27;s &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, Yasunari Kawabata&#x27;s &quot;The Lake&quot;, John Updike&#x27;s &quot;Rabbit Redux&quot; and &quot;Rabbit is Rich&quot;, and &quot;The Inheritors&quot;, &quot;Pincher Martin&quot;, &quot;The Spire&quot; and &quot;The Pyramid&quot; and &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; by William Golding.

His own works include both novels and dramas; &quot;Men of God&quot; (1974), &quot;Sarusok&quot; (1974), &quot;Magyar Médeia&quot; (1976), &quot;Rácsok&quot; (1979), &quot;Találkozások&quot; (1980) are among the most notable. He is also the author of &quot;Encounters&quot; (essays, 1980), &quot;Homecoming and Shavings&quot; (short stories, 1991), &quot;Hungarian Medea&quot; (play, 1979), &quot;Iron Bars&quot; (play, 1979), &quot;Balance&quot; (play, 1990). Göncz worked incredibly hard for ten hours per day with no pay. For instance, in 1982 he visited the United States on an academic conference with only $5 in his pocket. He won the Attila József Prize in 1983. In 1989 he won the Wheatland Prize, and two years later the Premio Meditteraneo. From 1989 to 1990 he was President and later Honorary President of the Hungarian Writers&#x27; Union. The person of Göncz was acceptable for both the liberal and &quot;rural-national&quot; intellectuals because of his past.

===Return to politics (1988–1990)===
By the beginning of the 1980s, the Kádár regime had increasingly indebted and was in ideological and legitimation crisis. Opposition movements established one after another; a group of intellectuals founded the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in Lakitelek in September 1987. In early 1988, Göncz was a co-founding member of the Historical Justice Committee (TIB) civil organization, which intended to revise the official communist stigmatization of the 1956 revolution. The organization was led by Erzsébet Nagy, daughter of Imre Nagy. The TIB demanded the worthy reburial of Nagy and the other executed persons.

When the security forces violently disbanded a peaceful demonstration in Budapest on 16 June 1988, the 30th anniversary of Nagy&#x27;s execution, Árpád Göncz, as Vice Chairman of the Historical Justice Committee, wrote a letter to General Secretary and Prime Minister Károly Grósz, Kádár&#x27;s successor to protest against the police action and called on the regime to face its past. In a response letter, Grósz rejected the implementation of demanded political reforms. Finally (due to the appointment of the reformist Miklós Németh as Prime Minister in November 1988) the reburial took place in the next year on 16 June, Göncz took part in organizing, as he proposed, there was a fifth empty coffin beside the four martyrs&#x27; for the anonymous heroes and freedom fighters of the revolution. Göncz was the one who officially opened the ceremony.

On 1 May 1988, Göncz also participated in the foundation of the Network of Free Initiatives (; SZKH), the predecessor organization of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). Initially, SZKH was a loose alliance of various independent civil groups, which intended to become an umbrella organization like the Solidarity in Poland. However, because of the widespread pluralism, the SZKH&#x27;s operation proved to be slow and time-consuming in the midst of accelerated events, thus on 13 November 1988, the majority of the organization decided to found the SZDSZ, Göncz was also a co-founding member and helped the formulation of the founding declaration. Ferenc Miszlivetz said, Göncz was an observer rather than an active proponent in the following rallies. In addition to MDF and SZDSZ, the third major anti-communist block was the liberal Alliance of Young Democrats, later known mostly by its acronym Fidesz. Göncz&#x27;s former party, the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party (FKGP) was re-established in those days, he visited the party&#x27;s inaugural session at the Pilvax Café but, for him, it was not attractive anymore, as most of the former members of the FKGP were already dead or stayed in emigration. Göncz considered the old debates between the &quot;rural-national&quot; and &quot;urbanist&quot; trends are outdated and detrimental after decades of communist rule, his liberal ideology became more dominant by 1988.

The reburial of Imre Nagy proved to be a catalyst event; the hard-line Grósz was outranked by a four-member collective presidency of the reformist wing within the MSZMP on 26 June 1989. The ruling communist party began discussions with the opposition groups within the framework of the so-called Round Table Talks. The question of the post-communist presidential position was one of the most problematic disputes between the parties. The MSZMP suggested a directly elected semi-presidential system, however this proposal was strongly refused by the sharply anti-communist SZDSZ and Fidesz, because the reformer communist Imre Pozsgay was the most popular Hungarian politician in those months. In August 1989, József Antall, leader of the MDF presented a new proposal (ceremonial presidential system with indirect elections by the parliament, but the first election by the people). Excluding SZDSZ, Fidesz and LIGA, the remaining five opposition groups and the MSZMP accepted and signed the proposal. However, following collecting signatures by Fidesz and SZDSZ, a four-part referendum was held on 26 November 1989, where the voters chose &quot;yes&quot; for the question of &quot;Should the president be elected after parliamentary elections?&quot;

The Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) won the first democratically free parliamentary election in March 1990, while SZDSZ came to the second place with 92 MPs, including Göncz, who gained mandate from the party&#x27;s Budapest regional list. József Antall became Prime Minister and entered coalition with FKGP and the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (KDNP). As there were several two-thirds laws according to the Hungarian Constitution, Antall concluded pact with SZDSZ, under which the liberal opposition party could nominee a candidate for the position of President of Hungary, in exchange for contribution to the constitutional amendments. According to some opinions, the pact concluded specifically for the person of Árpád Göncz.

József Antall and Árpád Göncz knew each other through the re-establishment of the FKGP. Their relationship was characterized by mutual trust according to contemporary reports. In addition, Antall&#x27;s father, József Antall Sr. was a prominent FKGP-member and friend of Béla Kovács in the 1940s. Political scientist László Lengyel argued that Göncz was a relatively unknown figure for the MDF leadership, who considered him &quot;far more moderate&quot; than other SZDSZ politicians, contrary to other candidate aspirants, like Miklós Vásárhelyi or György Konrád. Göncz&#x27;s well-known anti-communism was also an advantage for him. There is also a third possible explanation that Antall did not want to choose a head of state from his own party (especially Sándor Csoóri), fearing from a build of a second power base within MDF. Thus in the newly formed parliament&#x27;s inaugural meeting on 2 May 1990, Göncz was elected Speaker of the National Assembly. As Speaker, he served as Acting President until the August indirect presidential election according to the Constitution.

===Presidency (1990–2000)===
====First term (1990–1995)====

On 4 August, he was elected for a full term as president by the National Assembly by 295 votes to 13, thus becoming Hungary&#x27;s first democratically elected head of state. He was also Hungary&#x27;s first non-Communist president since the forced resignation of Zoltán Tildy 42 years earlier. After taking the oath before the new legislative speaker György Szabad (MDF), Göncz stated in his inaugural speech that &quot;&quot;I am not, I can not be a servant of parties, party interests. In my whole life, within and outside party, I served and I will serve for national independence, freedom of thought, freedom of faith in the idea of free homeland, and social justice with human rights without discrimination and exclusion.&quot; He also added, &quot;I would like to serve the unprotected, the defenceless people, those, who lacked the means to protect themselves both in the &quot;feudal crane feather world&quot;&quot; [referring to Miklós Horthy&#x27;s Hungary] &quot;and in the &quot;world of more equals among equals&quot;&quot; [i.e. the communist regime between 1945 and 1989].&quot;

Göncz was an avid supporter of Hungarian integration with the West, especially with the United Kingdom. In May 1990, Charles, Prince of Wales and his wife Diana undertook an official visit to Hungary and made history by becoming the first members of the British royal family to visit a former Warsaw Pact country. The royal couple were met at the airport by their host, newly elected interim President Göncz, who later hosted an official dinner to welcome the royal couple. Elizabeth II visited Hungary in May 1993, also welcomed by Göncz. He argued in favor of Hungary&#x27;s accession to NATO and the European Union. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of U.S. President Bill Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Partnership for Peace&quot; in Central Europe. As a result, in 2000, he was honored with the Vision for Europe Award for his efforts in creating a unified Europe. Göncz&#x27;s commitment towards the Western world earned some domestic negative criticism; in 1991, the far-right politician István Csurka, later defector from MDF and founder of the nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIÉP) accused him of being a tool of France, Israel, and the United States. During Göncz&#x27;s presidency, Pope John Paul II visited Hungary twice, in August 1991 and September 1996. They had already known each other through a common Polish friend, before John Paul&#x27;s papacy.

His relationship with Prime Minister József Antall and his cabinet became tense in the coming years. Göncz filled a counterbalancing role to the conservative cabinet, according to the critics, he proved to be acting in the vested interests of his party, the SZDSZ. Critics also said Göncz failed to act for the unity of the nation as a non-partisan head of state with these anti-government steps. However, as Dae Soon Kim notes, after a four-year Socialist government between 1994 and 1998, Göncz remained conflict-avoiding during the last two years of his presidency, when the right-wing Viktor Orbán governed the country as Prime Minister. During the Antall government, strong state intervention and control in market economic trends remained significant. Few months after the end of communism in Hungary, ideological conflicts tense between Antall and Göncz, who supported full privatization and reduction of the state. Despite the earlier conflicts, the seriously ill Antall was awarded Grand Cross of the Hungarian Order of Merit by President Árpád Göncz on 11 December 1993, a day before his death.

In October 1990, the so-called &quot;taxi-blockade&quot; broke out when the Antall government decided to raise the prices of petrol with 65 percent because of the Gulf War and oil supply disruptions in the Soviet Union. In response, the taxi drivers paralyzed traffic, when they blocked the main bridges in Budapest with their cars. János Kis, the leader of the SZDSZ assured solidarity with the demonstrators. There have been unconfirmed news that the government wanted to put the law enforcement forces to eliminate the blockade (according to eyewitnesses, heavy military vehicles had been dispatched to the capital), and Göncz, as Supreme Commander of the Hungarian Defence Force prevented this in a letter sent to Minister of the Interior Balázs Horváth. Göncz mediated between the government and the taxi drivers, finally, a compromise was reached. After that the Hungarian government strongly denied that they had mobilized the armed forces, and also emphasised that Göncz had overreacted to, or misjudged, the given situation. In April 1991, between Defence Minister Lajos Für and Árpád Göncz, a dispute arose over the right to be the Supreme Commander. The Constitutional Court concluded that the President is only the &quot;ceremonial&quot; leader of the army. The government said Göncz&#x27;s principal reason were extending presidential powers and personal reputation among the people. Political scientist Gabriella Ilonszki argued that the &quot;taxi-blockade was the first test of the new democracy and Göncz sought to avoid the violent actions of both sides at all costs.&quot; Nevertheless, the relationship between the MDF and SZDSZ deteriorated after the conflict. In February 1991, Antall and Göncz clashed over the right of international representation, when Hungary signed the Visegrád Group, along with Poland and Czechoslovakia. Göncz argued the two other partner countries were represented by presidents Václav Havel and Lech Wałęsa, however Antall interpreted the Hungarian president&#x27;s foreign policy powers more narrowly than Göncz due to the ambiguous Constitution.

On 24 April 1991, the National Assembly passed the Law on Compensation which intended to provide a symbolic financial aid to victims of the communist regime. The law was far from public expectations and generated debates in politics. On 14 May, Göncz sent the law to the Constitutional Court, asking for a judicial review. The Court ruled the law was unconstitutional in several aspects (arbitrary conditions etc.). Accordingly, by spring 1992, the law was revised several times and has been accepted again, however Göncz refused to sign the law again in April 1993. In a later interview, Göncz told that he missed the equality of rights in the law and the social consensus on the subject. Göncz also did not sign the &quot;Zétényi–Takács Law&quot;, named after two MDF politicians, which determined the communist political crimes are not subject to the statute of limitations. In November 1991 the law was submitted to the Constitutional Court by Göncz, which body (presided by László Sólyom) found the law as unconstitutional in March 1992 and later, after amendments, in June 1993. There were clashes between moral justice and the new republic&#x27;s commitment to the principle of the rule of law. Göncz&#x27;s stance was influenced by three factors: avoid social division and polarisation, liberal political beliefs and the significance of social consensus. Göncz refused the method of retroactive legislation and he feared that the law will be a tool for political revenge. By contrast, journalist Szilvia Varró said &quot;Göncz actively hindered the question of settling accounts with the communist past&quot;. In a November 1991 report, Göncz stated &quot;reckoning is necessary, but it should be made strictly within the framework of a state built on the rule of law.&quot; He added, after 1956 he was sentenced to life imprisonment during a secret trial without the possibility of appeal. &quot; I strongly feel that no procedure should be repeated that could be found illegal in retrospect.&quot;

Göncz was to deliver his annual memorial speech at Kossuth Square on the national day of 23 October 1992, when a group of far-right young skinheads and also &#x27;56 veterans hissed and booed, demanding Göncz&#x27;s resignation, when the President appeared on the podium. The &#x27;56 veterans disapproved of his decision not to sign the &quot;Zétényi–Takács Law&quot; earlier. Göncz was not able to start his speech and left the podium without saying a word. The government was accused of deliberately sabotage by the opposition, however Minister of the Interior Péter Boross said it was only a spontaneous event. The SZDSZ claimed the police did not intervene in the events intentionally to protect Göncz. Prime Minister Antall rejected the accusation of political pressure. In a June 2014 report, the Constitution Protection Office (AH) revealed that its predecessor organization, the Office of National Security (NBH) and the police forces escorted the dozens of skinheads from the Keleti Railway Station to the Kossuth Square. The most likely scenario is that there was no direct governmental connection indicating the event. It is possible that Antall and Boross knew about a potential provocation but they did not want to prevent it, as political analyst László Kéri considered it.

The most stormy incident was the &quot;Antall–Göncz media war&quot; during the years of his first term. In July 1990, as consensus between the six parliamentary parties, the National Assembly appointed sociologists Elemér Hankiss and Csaba Gombár as presidents of the Magyar Televízió and Magyar Rádió, respectively. In the summer of 1991, the Antall cabinet submitted new deputies of the state medias to counterbalance Hankiss and Gombár, however Göncz refused to countersign the appointments. Antall accused the President of overstepping his powers and turned to the Constitutional Court, which ruled in September in that year that the President does not have a right of veto with regard to appointments, &quot;unless those appointments endangered the democratic functioning of state institutions involved.&quot; Göncz did not change his position and began to play for time, thus the Prime Minister again turned to the Constitutional Court, which on 28 January 1992 ruled that the President should sign the appointments &quot;within a reasonable time.&quot;

In May 1992, a liberal and constitutionalist, Göncz faced a parliamentary censure when he condemned the government for interfering with Hungary&#x27;s state radio service and attempting to fire its director, Gombár. In June 1992, the Antall cabinet wanted to replace Hankiss too, however Göncz refused to accept it, reasoning that he would wait until the adoption of the new media law, however by the end of 1992, the issue of media control was not resolved due to the abstention of the SZDSZ during the vote, which needed two-third majority. In January 1993, Hankiss and Gombár resigned from the positions, referring to the media workers&#x27; livelihoods. Göncz was rebuked by the Antall cabinet and the government parties for trying to block the new media law and re-organization of the structure of the media. László Sólyom, President of the Constitutional Court also argued that Göncz exceeded his powers in the media issue. The contrast between the MDF and the SZDSZ was again due to the ambiguity of the new Constitution (nominal or actual right of appointment). Another key factor to the stalemate was the ambiguous ruling issued by the Constitutional Court (also under the influences of political parties, which delegated members) and its subsequent interpretations by Göncz and Antall. Göncz was able to play an active role in appointments due to the unclear term of &quot;endangerment of democracy&quot;. In those years, the Constitutional Court was usually under critics that it took on the legislative role of the parliament.

In November 1993, Göncz gave an interview to the Italian daily newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot;, which wrote &quot;the Hungarian media had been placed in a serious situation because of the right-wing government&#x27;s censorship&quot; and also added &quot;the President [Göncz] asks for international help!&quot;. Imre Kónya, the leader of the MDF parliamentary group rejected the accusations and called for an explanation from Göncz, who responded that the disputed phrases were only the &quot;journalist&#x27;s individual interpretation.&quot; Nonetheless, the MIÉP said Göncz had denigrated Hungary&#x27;s image by representing foreign interests and also attempted to set up an inquiry commission. Göncz explained, although did not agree with the article&#x27;s given title, it reflected the actual situation of the Hungarian media.

====Second term (1995–2000)====

During the May 1994 parliamentary election, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), legal successor of the ruling MSZMP in the one-party system before 1989, under the leadership of Gyula Horn, achieved a remarkable revival, winning an overall majority of 209 seats out of 386, up from 33 in 1990. Horn, despite winning an overall majority, decided to form a coalition with the formerly strong anti-communist Alliance of Free Democrats, giving him a two-thirds majority, to assuage public concerns inside and outside Hungary. After 1994, Göncz was largely passive and insignificant, in contrary to his proactive role and style during the Antall and Boross governments (Péter Boross became Prime Minister after Antall died of cancer in December 1993). Some of the critics suggested the one of the main reasons for this change was Göncz&#x27;s political affiliation: as Szilvia Varró said she does not remember that &quot;there was any issue on which he stood against Horn&quot;. However, as mentioned above, Göncz remained passive too during Viktor Orbán&#x27;s first cabinet (1998–2002), which installed a more power-concentrated governing structure through the newly established Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (MEH), led by István Stumpf.

Dae Soon Kim writes, there are three factors responsible for Göncz&#x27;s passivity; Firstly, his physical and mental condition has deteriorated in the second half of the 1990s. In December 1997, Göncz was hospitalized for two weeks for the treatment of dyspnea and a duodenal ulcer. Secondly, the President&#x27;s constitutional role clarified by that time. His proactive style became a subject of critics, and the Constitutional Court repeatedly ruled in favor of the Prime Minister, thus Göncz reviewed his previous position and turned to a ceremonial role. Finally, before 1990, Hungary had never experienced the institution of parliamentary democracy, as a result Göncz had no prior example to follow, when he was elected president in August 1990.

On 12 March 1995, the Horn government announced a series of fiscal austerity and economic stabilization measures, commonly known as the Bokros package. On 13 June 1995, Göncz approved and signed the package, despite requests made by the opposition parties, especially MDF and Fidesz. After that the opposition turned to the Constitutional Court, which found numerous elements of the package as unconstitutional. According to the fragmented opposition, Göncz followed his own party&#x27;s interests when signed the laws. In addition, Fidesz MP Lajos Kósa connected Göncz&#x27;s steps with the upcoming indirect presidential election about a week later. Göncz was re-elected on 19 June 1995 for another five-year term by the MSZP and SZDSZ coalition government (259 votes), defeating the candidate of the right-wing opposition, Ferenc Mádl (76 votes). Dae Soon Krim argues that Göncz, among others, considered the Bokros package as a painful but necessary step, which was the only method to avoid economic collapse.

Árpád Göncz refused to sign the Law of Incompatibility in January 1997, which was to provide the separation of the political and economical sphere by preventing MPs to maintain economic interests after their election. Following debates between the two governing parties, the Horn cabinet made a compromise solution: the MPs could keep their economical positions, if their post in business was acquired before they were elected to the National Assembly. Göncz sent the law back to the parliament because of the &quot;lack of equal rights and guarantee of free competition&quot; and protection of privacy, however the Socialists adopted the law again in unchanged form. Opposition politicians criticized Göncz, because he used only the presidential tool of &quot;political veto&quot;, instead of &quot;constitutional veto&quot;. The President also questioned the revised version of the Law on Privatisation, which passed by the Horn government on 19 December 1996. Accordingly, the State Privatisation and Property Management Co. (ÁPV Co.) was authorised to transfer state properties to local governments and cooperatives without restriction, the coalition partner SZDSZ and the right-wing opposition parties (Fidesz, MDF, FKGP) opposed the law, citing reasons of corruption. In January 1997, Göncz vetoed the law, returned it to the parliament for reconsideration.

Shortly after the inauguration of the first Orbán cabinet, disagreement evolved around the presidential pardon between Göncz and the Ministry of Justice. Banker Péter Kunos, former CEO of Agrobank, who was arrested on corruption charges in November 1994, was sentenced to two years imprisonment in April 1998. Kunos, citing health reasons, pleaded for a presidential pardon to Göncz, who accepted it on 9 November 1998. However Minister of Justice Ibolya Dávid decided not to release Kunos. The case was in the political spectrum as István Stumpf said SZDSZ had a close relationship with the Agrobank during Gyula Horn&#x27;s government. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office could not prove the minister&#x27;s allegations with documents. Ibolya Dávid&#x27;s decision was popular among the general public. Stumpf later told that Dávid exploited the situation for her political career. Göncz&#x27;s decision was influenced by lack of legal remedies in Kunos&#x27; second-degree trial (at first, Kunos was acquitted in July 1997). Göncz thought the general public should not be affected in the outcome of some court cases. Gabriella Ilonszki said, Göncz issued a pardon to Kunos on human grounds. &quot;When the protection of democratic values and sympathy for an individual were in conflict, Göncz decided to stand by the individual&quot;, she added.

===Later life (2000–2015)===

Göncz completed his five years of second term on 4 August 2000. He was replaced by Ferenc Mádl, who was elected President by the National Assembly&#x27;s right-wing majority on 6 June 2000. In a ceremony at the Kossuth Square, he emphasized that he passes the position to Mádl with &quot;respect and friendship&quot;. He also asked God&#x27;s blessing on the successful work of Ferenc Mádl. Göncz added, during his 10-year term, he tried to keep in mind that the &quot;democratic state can only be people-oriented organization&quot;.

After his presidency, Göncz completely retired from politics and resided in a state residence at Béla király Street along with his wife until his death in October 2015. In September 2000, he was appointed President of the Hungary in Europe Foundation which awarded literary prizes annually. He gave a speech on 23 October 2000, where he told &quot;the proliferating phrases during annual commemorations had overshadowed the actual events of the 1956 revolution.&quot; In November 2000, Göncz became an honorary citizen of Budapest, awarded by the city&#x27;s Mayor and fellow SZDSZ member Gábor Demszky. In December 2000, a prize was founded by the United States, named after Göncz. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright awarded the Göncz Prize to Erika Csovcsics, headmistress of the Gandhi School for the first time.

In April 2003, Göncz participated in the signing ceremony of Hungary&#x27;s join to the European Union in Athens, Greece. In July 2003, Göncz was among the speakers at the so-called Szárszó meetings, a political forum of mostly left-wing intellectuals and politicians, organized by Tivadar Farkasházy. In an open letter, along with Havel and Wałęsa, he demanded the release of political prisoners in Cuba from Fidel Castro in September 2003.

On 10 February 2012, hundreds welcomed Göncz with serenades and speeches on the occasion of his 90th birthday, at the initiative of composer and songwriter János Bródy, writer György Konrád and former SZDSZ leader Gábor Kuncze. Then-President Pál Schmitt also greeted his predecessor by telephone from the Arraiolos meeting in Helsinki and conveyed the best wishes of the summit&#x27;s participants (heads of states).

==Personal life==
On 11 January 1947, Göncz married Mária Zsuzsanna Göntér (16 November 1923 – 3 June 2020) and had four children; two sons (Benedek, Dániel) and two daughters (Kinga and Annamária). Kinga Göncz, who held various ministerial positions in the cabinets of Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány and also a former Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2006 to 2009, is his daughter and eldest child. She was Member of the European Parliament between 2009 and 2014. In November 2012, Göncz&#x27;s four children founded the Göncz Árpád Foundation to promote the presentation and research of their father&#x27;s life and career, as well as cultivating the memory of the Hungarian democratic and liberal traditions. István Bibó Jr., András Gulyás and János M. Rainer became advisory board members.

==Death and funeral==
Árpád Göncz died on 6 October 2015 in Budapest, aged 93. As the news emerged about Göncz&#x27;s death, Hungarian lawmakers immediately held a minute of silence in parliament, where Deputy Speaker István Hiller said Göncz &quot;was a legend already in his lifetime&quot;. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the governing Fidesz told in a statement that &quot;we remember [Göncz] with respect as an active and important political player in those years when Hungary stepped on the road from dictatorship to democracy&quot;. The coalition partner KDNP added, &quot;Árpád Göncz&#x27;s personality and life intertwined with Hungary&#x27;s modern history, the period of [democratic] transition&quot;. The left-wing opposition parties, MSZP, Democratic Coalition (DK), Together, Politics Can Be Different (LMP), Dialogue for Hungary (PM) and Hungarian Liberal Party (MLP) also paid tribute to Göncz&#x27;s political legacy and life, while the far-right Jobbik sent its condolence to his family. On 7 October 2015, thousands gathered for President Göncz at the Kossuth Square, mourning with flowers and candles in front of the Hungarian Parliament Building. On 12 October 2015, Speaker László Kövér said in the next first full plenary session that &quot;the life path of Göncz coincided with major events in Hungary&#x27;s 20th century history&quot;. He added, Göncz, beside his writer and translation career, was also a &quot;loved and respected as a politician as well, and even long after he had left his office in 2000&quot;.

Foreign media also remembered on Göncz&#x27;s death; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote Göncz was &quot;widely beloved&quot; among the Hungarians, who called him just as their &quot;Uncle Árpi&quot;. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Göncz &quot;worked with skill over a decade to realign his country with the West and heal the wounds of the past.&quot; Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission said Göncz was a &quot;democrat&quot; and a &quot;true European&quot;. During her state visit to Hungary on 7 October, Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović expressed condolences for the death of Göncz to President János Áder and the Hungarian people. Socialist MEP István Ujhelyi also commemorated Göncz in the European Parliament. Ujhelyi said &quot;Hungary is mourning one of Europe&#x27;s wise men and one of the greatest figures of the Hungarian democracy.&quot;

In accordance with his last will and testament, Göncz was buried near the graves of his late friends and fellow &#x27;56 prisoners, István Bibó, György Litván and Miklós Vásárhelyi at the Óbudai cemetery on 6 November 2015, without official state representation and military honour. The funeral, celebrated by Archabbot Asztrik Várszegi and actor András Bálint, was attended by former and incumbent politicians, representatives of the parliamentary parties and diplomatic missions. Imre Mécs gave the first funeral oration, where he said &quot;Árpi [Göncz] was a man of love, but could also be decisive&quot;. Singer Zsuzsa Koncz and composer János Bródy sang their famous song, &quot;Ha én rózsa volnék&quot; (&quot;If I were a rose&quot;). On behalf of the family, Göncz&#x27;s eldest grandson, political scientist Márton Benedek farewelled his grandfather.

<doc id="329027" wikidata="Q1683044" url="?curid=329027" title="Supertone Records">
<text>Supertone Records was an American record label in the 1920s. Supertone Records were marketed by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. in 1924 and again in 1929–1931. Supertone was one of several record disc brand names marketed by Sears. Supertone records were initially made by the Fletcher Record Company in 1924. The discs produced by Fletcher included midwestern dance bands. When Fletcher failed in mid–1924, Bridgeport Die &amp; Machine Company began producing Supertone discs in late 1924.

Sears did not register the Supertone brand name for record production, and after Sears discontinued marketing the records, the Chicago store Straus &amp; Schram used the name, exclusively selling records produced by Regal (Scranton Button Company), Paramount Records, then in Grey Gull between 1925 and 1928. In 1926, Pathé Records supplied pressings until late 1927–early 1928, when Columbia&#x27;s Harmony division started a 1000–S series of Supertone records until mid–1928 when Sears restarted their Supertone series (then Straus &amp; Schram Supertone&#x27;s renamed Puritone).

Sears claimed and marketed the brand again in 1928. Between 1928 and through 1930, Gennett pressed Supertone Records using their own masters. When Gennett was discontinued in late 1930, Sears contracted with Brunswick Radio Corporation to produce Supertone Records, which lasted through 1931. The 1928–1930 Gennett pressed Supertone discs are most commonly seen. The earlier versions, as well as the short-lived Brunswick versions, are quite scarce.

===Cityscape===
==History==
===Origins===
The area around present-day Okazaki has been inhabited for many thousands of years. Archaeologists have found remains from the Japanese Paleolithic period.
Numerous remains from the Jōmon period, and especially from the Yayoi and Kofun periods, have been found, including many &quot;kofun&quot; burial mounds.

===Sengoku period===
During the Sengoku period, the area was controlled by the Matsudaira clan, a branch of which later rose to prominence as the Tokugawa clan, who ruled Japan during the Edo period.

===Edo period===
During this time, Okazaki Domain, a feudal &quot;han&quot; was established to rule the immediate area around Okazaki and was entrusted to a &quot;fudai daimyō&quot;.
Several smaller domains were in the present-day city limits, including Fukozu (later Mikawa-Nakajima), Okudono Domain and Nishi-Ohira Domain. The town prospered as a post station on the Tōkaidō connecting Edo with Kyoto.

===Meiji period===
Following the Meiji Restoration, the modern town of Okazaki was established on October 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system in Nukata District of Aichi Prefecture. On October 1, 1914, Okazaki annexed neighboring Hirohata Town. Okazaki was proclaimed a city on July 1, 1916.

The city suffered damage in both the 1944 Tōnankai earthquake (which killed 9 people) and the 1945 Mikawa earthquake (which killed 29 people). During World War II, the July 19, 1945 Bombing of Okazaki killed over 200 people and destroyed most of the city center. Although Okazaki was the location of an Imperial Japanese Navy airfield, military installations were not damaged in the attack.

===Modern Okazaki===
In 1955, through a series of mergers and consolidations, the area of Okazaki expanded considerably. The former towns of Iwazu, Fukuoka, and Yahagi, and the villages of Motojuku, Yamanaka, Kawai, Fujikawa, and Ryugai were all merged into Okazaki. The 1959 Isewan Typhoon caused considerable damage, and killed 27 residents. On October 15, 1962, Okazaki annexed the neighboring town of Mutsumi.

Okazaki was proclaimed a core city on April 1, 2003, with increased autonomy from the prefectural government. On January 1, 2006, the town of Nukata (from Nukata District) was merged into Okazaki.

=== Okazaki Castle ===
Okazaki Castle was originally built in 1455. Captured by the Matsudaira clan in 1524 (and probably relocated from the other side of the river), the castle remains associated with Tokugawa Ieyasu, even though the latter transferred to Edo in 1590. During the Edo period it served as the seat of the Okazaki Domain and dominated the city until the Meiji Restoration.

=== Fireworks ===
Okazaki is famous for its fireworks. The Tokugawa shogunate restricted production of gunpowder outside of the immediate region of Okazaki (with few exceptions). Even today, more than 70% of Japan&#x27;s fireworks are designed and manufactured here. A large fireworks festival, which people from all over Japan come to see, is held annually on the first Saturday in August in the area surrounding Okazaki Castle.

=== &quot;Hatchō miso&quot; ===

&quot;Hatchō miso&quot; (八丁味噌) is a dark &quot;miso&quot; paste made using a process of steaming soybeans (instead of boiling) followed by maturation in cedar barrels under the weight of 3 tons of carefully stacked river stones for at least 2 years. Located 8 &quot;chō&quot; (&quot;hatchō&quot;, or approximately 900m) west of Okazaki Castle near the Yahagi river, there are two 8-cho miso companies — Maruya from 1337 and Kakukyu.

The old tiled buildings are heritage-listed and Kaku has been a family business for 18 generations. It is one of the most famous &quot;miso&quot; producers in Japan, supplying the Emperor by appointment, and popular as a health food. A 2006 NHK morning drama serial, &quot;Junjo Kirari&quot; (Sparkling Innocence), was largely filmed in and around the Hatchō miso grounds. Tours are available every 30 minutes and free samples are provided. Hatchō miso&#x27;s health properties are considered so great that it was donated to Chernobyl&#x27;s citizens following the disaster, to help prevent and treat radiation sickness.

=== Takisan ===
The Buddhist temple of Takisan-ji (7th century) includes several Important Cultural Properties of Japan. The main hall is from the Kamakura period and is the location of a fire festival held each February on the closest Saturday to the lunar calendar New Year. The distinctive &quot;Sanmon&quot; gate and the main image are designated as important cultural properties. Adjoining the temple is Takisan Tōshō-gū, a Shinto Shrine built in 1646 by Tokugawa Iemitsu.

==Culture==
=== Language ===
While the local Mikawa dialect is considered to be generally indistinguishable from what is considered modern standard Japanese, there are subtle and distinctive differences. Mikawa dialect has, on the other hand, substantial differences when compared to the dialect of Nagoya and western areas of Aichi, where the Nagoya dialect (also known as &quot;Owari-ben&quot;, Owari being the traditional name for the Nagoya region) is the traditional dialect. Cognitively Mikawa-ben and modern contemporary Japanese are extremely close, in part due to the influence of the Tokugawa shogunate and accidents of history. In recent decades a large number of people moving into Okazaki and the surrounding cities (particularly to work in the motor vehicle industry) and mass media have influenced the local dialect, with the result that in day-to-day life more people are using only standard Japanese.

<doc id="329036" wikidata="Q389495" url="?curid=329036" title="Toyokawa, Aichi">
<text>is a city in the eastern part of Aichi Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 183,930 in 72,949 households, and a population density of 1,141 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . Toyokawa, famous for its Toyokawa Inari temple, has a good balance of industry, commerce, agriculture and forestry, and is situated in an area rich in history, traditions, and culture.

==Geography==
Located in the eastern part of Aichi Prefecture, the city has the Toyogawa River to the east, the Otoha River to the west, and the Sana River in the central area, flowing into Mikawa Bay in the southwest. The northern part of the city is predominantly mountainous, featuring numerous golf courses.

The city is divided into three districts covering 122.4 hectares in the central business area: the Suwa District, where public institutions and commercial facilities are located, the Toyogawa District, which developed as the gateway town to Toyogawa Inari Shrine, and the Chuo-dori District, connecting both areas. The city has implemented the &quot;Basic Plan for Revitalization of the Central Business District,&quot; aiming to promote development in the central business district [4].

However, due to the merger of four villages that originally formed independent central areas, the city struggled to form a centralized urban center. Despite the expansive nature of the city&#x27;s urban areas, the central functions are dispersed among several stations in different districts. Notably, Toyogawa Station, despite its name, does not function as the central station, further complicating the formation of a centralized business district. Consequently, large-scale commercial facilities and urban development lagged behind, leading to a prolonged situation where the purchasing population flowed to neighboring cities.

Entering the Heisei era, efforts were made to open medium-sized commercial facilities in the Suwa District and its vicinity. Simultaneously, roadside stores concentrated around Toyokawa IC and the southern part of Nagadoshi, near the border with Toyohashi City, without a clear shift in the decentralization trend.

Major roads, such as National Route 1 to the west, National Route 23 to the southwest, and National Route 151 from the east to the south, traverse the city. Additionally, the Hime Kaido (Hon-Zaka Street) runs east to west within the city. There are four railway lines, roughly parallel to the main roads.

In spring, cherry blossoms bloom along the Sana River, Otoha River, and in the Sakura Tunnel near the city hall, adding color to the streets. The summer season sees various festivals throughout the city, creating a lively atmosphere. The city enjoys a relatively mild climate, with little to no snowfall even in winter.

===Climate===
The city has a climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Toyokawa is 15.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1751 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 27.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.8 °C.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Toyokawa has been increasing over the past 60 years.

====Showa period====
Toyokawa City was founded on June 1, 1943, by the merger of Toyokawa town with neighboring Ushikubo Town and Yawata Village, all from Hoi District.

In 1939 the massive Toyokawa Naval Arsenal was established, one of the largest producers of machine guns, aviation ordnance and ammunition in the Empire of Japan. 
It also had sections that produced military-issue &quot;katana&quot;, bayonets, and glass lenses for use in cameras, binoculars, and similar equipment. 
During World War II, many thousands of civilians were conscripted or volunteered to work at the Arsenal, and towards the end of the war, this workforce included hundreds of middle school students and high school girls. 
On August 7, 1945, the Toyokawa Naval Arsenal was targeted by a flight of B-29 bombers. 
About 2,500 people were killed during the Toyokawa Air Raid.

==History==
===Feudal period===
Kariya was a castle town in the Sengoku period, in an area contested between the Imagawa clan, Oda clan and various local warlords, including the Mizuno clan and Matsudaira clan.

===Early modern period===
Tokugawa Ieyasu’s maternal grandfather Mizuno Tadamasa rebuilt Kariya Castle in the mid-16th century. 
The Mizuno clan shifted allegiances adroitly between the Imagawa clan to Oda Nobunaga and to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who relocated the clan to Ise Province.

However, Mizuno Katsunari, the grandson of Tadamasa was allowed to return to the clan&#x27;s ancestral territories by Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kariya Domain, a feudal han under the Tokugawa shogunate.
The domain was reassigned to numerous clans during the Edo period, but was retained by the Doi clan from 1734 until the Meiji Restoration.

===Late modern period===
After the Meiji Restoration, Kariya Town was created within Hekikai District, Aichi Prefecture with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889.
The town prospered as a center for commerce, sake production, sericulture and ceramics due to its location on the main railway routes.
The Yosami Transmitting Station, located in Kariya, was Japan&#x27;s tallest structure when completed in 1929.

===Contemporary history===
Kariya achieved city status on April 1, 1950. The city expanded by annexation of neighboring Fujimatsu and most of Yosami villages on April 1, 1955.
Control of the Yosami Transmitting Station was returned to Japan from the United States Navy in 1994, and the former facility is now a city park.

== History ==
===Origins===
The area of present-day Toyota City has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and archaeologists have found a continuous record of artifacts from the Japanese paleolithic period onwards.
In early proto-historic times, the area was under the control of the Mononobe clan, who built numerous &quot;kofun&quot; burial mounds. The local place name &quot;Koromo&quot; is mentioned in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and other early Japanese documents.

=== Edo period ===
During the Edo period, parts of the area of the current city were under the control of Koromo Domain, a feudal &quot;han&quot; under the Tokugawa shogunate; however, most of the area of the current city was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled directly by the government in Edo and administered through &quot;hatamoto&quot; class appointed administrators. The village of &quot;Matsudaira&quot;, from which Tokugawa Ieyasu took his clan name, was located within what is now the city of Toyota.

===Meiji period===
After the Meiji restoration, the area was organized into the towns of Asuke and Koromo and numerous villages under Higashikamo District and Nishikamo District with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

The area was a major producer of silk and prospered from the Meiji period through the Taishō periods. As the demand for raw silk declined in Japan and abroad, Koromo entered a period of gradual decline after 1930. The decline encouraged Kiichiro Toyoda, cousin of Eiji Toyoda, to look for alternatives to the family&#x27;s automatic loom manufacturing business. The search led to the founding of what became the Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyota built the first manufacturing facility, known as Toyota Honsha plant in November 1938, breaking ground in December 1935.

===Modern history===
On March 1, 1951, Koromo gained city status, and absorbed the village of Takahashi from Nishikamo District on September 30, 1956. Due to the fame and economic importance of its major employer, the city of changed its name to Toyota on January 1, 1959.

Toyota became a sister city with Detroit, Michigan, United States in 1960. It continued to expand by annexing the towns of Kamigo (Hekikai District) on March 1, 1964, and Takaoka (Hekikai District) on September 1, 1965, and Sanage (Nishikamo District) on April 1, 1967, as well as the village of Matsudaira (Higashikamo District) on April 1, 1970.

In 1979 the Nagoya Railroad (Meitetsu) opened the Toyota New Line (now Toyota Line), and in 1988: The Aichi Loop Line was opened, thus considerably improving access to the city via rail transport.

Toyota became a Core City in 1998, with increased local autonomy.

On March 25, 2005, Expo 2005 opened with its main site in Nagakute and additional activity in Seto and Toyota. The Expo continued until September 25, 2005.

On April 1, 2005, Toyota absorbed the town of Fujioka, and the village of Obara (both from Nishikamo District), the towns of Asuke, Asahi and Inabu, and the village of Shimoyama (all from Higashikamo District) to create the new and expanded city of Toyota.

Mitsuru Obe and Eric Pfanner of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that by 2015 Toyota was recovering from an economic depression &quot;so deep that some were comparing it to Detroit.&quot;

==History==
===Origins===
The area of present-day Anjō has been continuously occupied since preshistoric times. Archaeologists have found numerous remains from the Japanese Paleolithic period and burial mounds from the Kofun period.
===Ancient history===
During the Nara period, the area was assigned to ancient Hekikai County, and was divided into several &quot;shōen&quot; during the Heian period, largely under the control of the Fujiwara clan or the Taira clan. 
===Feudal period===
However, in the Kamakura period, parts of the territory came under the control of the Jōdo Shinshū sect, who challenged the secular authority of the various samurai clans, most notably the Matsudaira clan. 

During the Sengoku period, numerous fortifications were erected in the area.

===Early modern period===
Tokugawa Ieyasu unified the region and destroyed the power of the Jōdo Shinshū sect in the Battle of Azukizaka (1564). During the Edo period, half of present-day Anjō was controlled by Okazaki Domain and the other half by Kariya Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate with some scattered portions of &quot;tenryō&quot; territory ruled directly by the shogunate. During this period, the area was noted for its production of cotton and textiles.
