<text>A star party is a gathering of amateur astronomers for the purpose of observing objects and events in the sky. Local star parties may be one-night affairs, but larger events can last a week or longer and attract hundreds or even thousands of participants. Many astronomy clubs have monthly star parties during the warmer months. Large regional star parties are held annually and are an important part of the hobby of amateur astronomy. A naturally dark site away from light pollution is typical. 

Participants bring telescopes and binoculars of all types and sizes and spend the nights observing astronomical objects such as planets, comets, stars, and deep-sky objects together. Astrophotography and CCD imaging are also very popular. At larger star parties, lectures, swap meets, exhibitions of home-built telescopes, contests, tours, raffles, and other similar activities are common. Commercial vendors selling a variety of astronomical equipment may also be present. As with other hobbyist gatherings, much camaraderie and discussion of various aspects of the hobby occurs at any star party.

==History==
The idea of a star party is not new and allegedly goes back at least as far as George III of the United Kingdom, who was passionately interested in astronomy and mathematics. On nights when poor weather blocked the view of the real stars and planets, attendants are said to have hung paper lanterns marked with drawings in the trees around the royal palace to provide something else for the King and his guests to spot through their telescopes.

==Public star parties==
Star parties whose focus is on bringing the stars to the people are often staged in urban areas where people congregate in large numbers. This is in contrast to star parties typically held in remote dark-sky areas more conducive to stargazing.

In the US, notable star parties include the annual Winter Star Party, held in the Florida Keys; the Mid Atlantic Star Party, held on the east coast of the United States; the Oregon Star Party; the Stellafane Convention, held in Vermont; the Texas Star Party, held in west Texas; and the Okie-Tex Star Party, held near Kenton, Oklahoma. In Canada, Starfest, held near Ayton, Ontario, is organized by the North York Astronomical Association. In the United Kingdom, notable annual star parties include the Spring and Autumn Equinox star parties held at Kelling Heath Holiday Park and Kielder in Northumbria. In Australia, the South Pacific Star Party is held each year. In Sri Lanka, Star Party Sri Lanka is held annually at the University of Peradeniya premises.

<text>Freshwater sharks are sharks that live in freshwater environments. While the majority of sharks are solely marine, a small number of shark species have adapted to live in freshwater.

The river sharks (of the genus &quot;Glyphis&quot;) live in freshwater and coastal marine environments. The bull shark (&quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;), can swim between salt and fresh water, and are found in tropical rivers around the world. 

Some prehistoric sharks (in a broad sense), including hybodonts and xenacanths, are also thought to have inhabited freshwater environments.

A small number of freshwater fish cyprinids and catfish (which are bony fish and thus quite unrelated to sharks) are also commonly called &quot;freshwater sharks&quot;, &quot;sharkminnows&quot; or simply &quot;sharks&quot;, particularly in the aquarium fish trade:
* &quot;Balantiocheilos melanopterus&quot; – Bala shark, tricolor shark, silver shark
* &quot;Epalzeorhynchos&quot; – typical freshwater &quot;sharks&quot;
* &quot;Labeo&quot; – 
* &quot;Puntius denisonii&quot; – Roseline shark
* &quot;Pangasianodon hypophthalmus&quot; – Iridescent Shark
* &quot;Pangasius sangitwongsei&quot; – sometimes called Paroon Shark or Hi-Fin Shark in the aquarium trade</text><links>

<doc id="328574" wikidata="Q2991780" url="?curid=328574" title="Penetanguishene">
<text>Penetanguishene (, sometimes shortened to Penetang) is a town in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the southeasterly tip of Georgian Bay. Incorporated on February 22, 1882, this bilingual (French and English) community has a population of 8,962 in the Canada 2016 Census.

The name &quot;Penetanguishene&quot; is believed to come from either the Wyandot or Abenaki via Ojibwe, meaning &quot;land of the white rolling sands&quot;.

==History==
As early as AD 800, the Wyandot people settled in semi-permanent villages in the area. The young French translator, Étienne Brûlé, was the first European to set foot in the Penetanguishene area, some time between 1610 and 1614. He was murdered in 1633 in Toanche, just across the bay from the modern town of Penetanguishene.

In 1793, John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, visited the area and saw the location&#x27;s potential as a Royal Navy naval base. He wanted to use the bay to shelter warships to protect Upper Canada, which had coasts on lakes Huron, Erie and Michigan opposite the Northwest Territory and New York State of the United States of America, from American military aggression and territorial expansion.

The Penetanguishene Naval Yard was built by the Royal Navy in 1813. In 1814, the Penetanguishene Road was constructed to provide the Yard a land route to British military supply depots on Kempenfelt Bay, Lake Simcoe (where Barrie, Ontario is today) as the Yard was previously accessible only by water.

In 1817, naval units from Michilimackinac and Schooner Town (near modern-day Wasaga Beach) were consolidated at the Penetanguishene Naval Yard. But, because Treaty of Ghent limitations with the U.S. limited both countries&#x27; naval power on the Great Lakes, two British armed topsail schooners, HMS &quot;Tecumseth&quot; and HMS &quot;Newash&quot; were laid up &quot;in ordinary&quot;, and eventually reported to have sunk at their moorings in the harbour in 1828. Some other small craft were headquartered in Penetanguishene for the exploration and mapping of the Great Lakes&#x27; coastline overseen by Lieutenant Henry Wolsey Bayfield.

In 1828, the main British military establishment on the Upper Lakes moved from Drummond Island to Penetanguishene. Families of Metis fur traders who had moved with the British from Michilimackinac to Drummond Island after the War of 1812, moved again to Penetanguishene. They settled in the town and the surrounding area. Although the naval base was closed in 1834, the military base remained until 1856. Some of the troops settled in the area after their service was complete providing an English-speaking population.

In the 1840s, French-speaking families from Canada East (mainly from the area immediately east of Montreal), attracted by promises of cheap and fertile land, joined the French-speaking Drummond Island settlers already in the area. Later, as the logging industry began to develop, more English-speaking settlers arrived. Penetanguishene became the local market and meeting place for these individuals. Many of Penetanguishene&#x27;s families today are descended from the Québécois settlers who arrived in the 1800s, giving the town a marked bilingual nature.

== Modern Day==
Penetanguishene began to slow down its growth near the 1980s after the railway and the local Coca-Cola plant were both shut down; the railway due to widespread use of cars and the Coca-Cola plant due to modern water filtration which requires chlorine. Coca-Cola had originally used Penetanguishene as a site to make its beverages due to its high water quality, due to the chlorination the water lacked its previous quality. On Main St the houses coming in to the town on the left were torn down in the 1990s and a new strip mall was added to replace them. Penetang hosts a Bingo hall and a local summer theatre (Kings Warf Theatre).

==Economy==
Penetanguishene historically had several light industrial businesses mainly dealing with plastic and aluminum containers. CCL which makes aluminum containers closed its Penetang factory in June 2017. It is host to the Central North Correctional Centre. In addition there is the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care which includes a high security forensic psychiatric unit for people declared to be not criminally responsible for dangerous offences but considered unsafe to be allowed in the community.

Tourism occupies a considerable portion of the economy with five marinas and shops and restaurants catering to the tourist trade. In the winter, snowmobiling and ice fishing is popular as well as the annual Winterama festival, (Ontario’s longest running winter carnival which started in 1948).

==Tourism and sights==

The historic naval and military base (now called Discovery Harbour) near Penetanguishene is open to visitors. There are reconstructed buildings from the historic Penetanguishene Naval Yard and two replica sailing ships from the 1812 period, HMS &quot;Bee&quot; and HMS &quot;Tecumseth&quot; (c. 1994). The ships no longer sail with passengers but they may be visited in the harbour. The original HMS Tecumseth was raised in 1953 and preserved at a nearby display area.

The King&#x27;s Wharf Theatre located at Discovery Harbour has a programme of popular plays and musicals every summer.

There are two notable and historic churches located in Penetanguishene. The oldest is St. James on-the-Lines, a small wooden Anglican church built in 1836 to serve the military garrison and civilian population. The most prominent is the large limestone Roman Catholic church named St. Anne&#x27;s. Originally named &quot;Ste-Anne&#x27;s Jesuit Memorial Church: Canadian National Shrine&quot;, it is sometimes referred to today as the &quot;Cathedral of the North&quot;. The Church was constructed between 1886 and 1902 by pastor Théophile François Laboureau. Laboureau secured major funding for the church from the Bishops of Rouen and Normandy in France as well as the governments of England, France and the United States. As it serves a bilingual Catholic community, services are held in both French and English.

==Education==
Penetanguishene has five different school boards within its limits — the publicly funded English board (Simcoe County District School Board), which runs James Keating Elementary School; the French Catholic School Board Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud, which operates École élémentaire catholique Saint-Louis; the Public French School Board, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde and the English Catholic School Board. The town is also home to the province&#x27;s last remaining Protestant Separate school board, Penetanguishene Protestant Separate School Board.

From 1995 to 2001, the town was home to a satellite campus of the defunct francophone Collège des Grands-Lacs.

==Sports==
Penetanguishene is home to the Penetang Kings of the Provincial Junior Hockey League. They are in the Carruthers division in the Ontario Hockey Association.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Penetanguishene had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Media==
The town is home to a francophone community radio station, CFRH-FM (Vague FM), but is otherwise served by media based in the neighbouring town of Midland.

<doc id="328576" wikidata="Q296478" url="?curid=328576" title="Hanno the Navigator">
<text>Hanno the Navigator (sometimes &quot;Hannon&quot;; , ; ) was a Carthaginian explorer (sometimes identified as a king) who lived during the fifth century BC, known for his naval expedition along the coast of West Africa. However, the only source of said voyage is a &quot;periplus&quot; translated into Greek. 

Historians have attempted to identify specific locations along Hanno&#x27;s route, based on the &quot;periplus&quot;. According to some modern analyses, his expedition could have potentially reached as far south as Gabon; still, according to other sources, he could not have sailed much further than coastal southern Morocco.

== Biography ==

The name of Hanno was given to many Carthaginians. Ancient texts which specifically mention Hanno the Navigator do not provide much in the way of positively identifying him; some authors referred to him as a king, while others referred to him with the Latin words &quot;&quot; (leader, general) or &quot;&quot; (commander, emperor). The Greek translation of Hanno&#x27;s &quot;periplus&quot; account names him a &quot;basileus&quot;, a term which may be interpreted as &quot;king&quot;, but was commonly used for other high-level Carthaginian officials.

The consensus of scholarship places Hanno as living sometime in the 5th century BC, identifying him as a member of the aristocratic Magonid family. R.C.C. Law identifies Hanno as the son of Hamilcar I.

== &quot;Periplus&quot; account ==

Hanno&#x27;s account, the &quot;periplus&quot; ( circumnavigation), remains extant in Greek-language manuscripts. The original version, written in the Punic language, has been lost. The Greek translation is abridged and 101 lines long. While it contains contradictions and obvious errors, it is probably derived from an original Carthaginian text. The &quot;periplus&quot; has survived as &quot;the nearest we have to a specimen of Carthaginian &#x27;literature&#x27; &quot; and one of the few extant accounts of ancient exploration penned by the explorer himself.

In the fifth century, the text was translated into Greek. Over the centuries, the translation was copied several times by Greek and Greek-speaking Roman clerks. Two copies remain extant, dating to the 9th and 14th centuries. Conrad Gessner produced the first Latin translation, printed at Zurich in 1559.

===Summary===

This summary is based on a translation by Al. N. Oikonomides. The proper names are unchanged from the translation. It reflects the views of the translator and may ignore more widely accepted theories among scholars.

As the work begins, &quot;this is the report of the &quot;periplus&quot; of Hanno, king of the Carthaginians, into the Libyan areas of the earth beyond the Pillars of Hercules which he dedicated in the sanctuary of Kronos.&quot; With 60 ships and 30,000 people, Hanno intends to found cities along the African coast. He first founds one city, then sails some distance and founds five others. Arriving at a river, the Carthaginians meet the Lixitae, a friendly nomadic tribe. They learn of the nearby Ethiopians, and taking aboard several Lixitae, set sail again. At the small island Kerne, another settlement is built. Around the lake Chretes and an unnamed river, there are savage men and large wild beasts respectively. After returning to Kerne, they sail further south down Africa, finding Ethiopians whose language even the Lixitae interpreters do not understand. Passing further, Hanno finds an &quot;immense opening of the sea&quot;, from which fires may be sighted. At a bay called the &quot;Horn of the West&quot;, they land on an island where humans live. The Carthaginians hurry away in fear and reach lands where there are many flames. A very tall mountain is there. Finally arriving at a bay, the &quot;Horn of the South&quot;, there is an island with hostile, hirsute men named &quot;Gorillas&quot; (see ). Three of them are killed, their skins brought home to Carthage. Having run out of provisions, they do not sail further. The &quot;periplus&quot; abruptly ends here without discussing the return journey.

===Textual criticism===
Both ancient and modern authors have criticized the work. Most attempts to locate the places described in the &quot;periplus&quot; based on the reported sailing distances and directions have failed. To make the text more accurate, scholars have tried textual criticism. Ultimately, the Carthaginians probably edited the real account to protect their trade: other countries would not be able to identify the places described, while Carthaginians could still boast about their accomplishments. 
Oikonomides theorizes that the hypothetical Punic manuscript that was translated into Greek was incomplete itself: it left out the later parts of the original &quot;periplus&quot;. The ending of the narrative is abrupt, and it would also have been logically impossible for the expedition to end as described. Therefore, he argues, the final two lines must have been inserted to compensate for an incomplete manuscript.

== Expedition ==
Carthage dispatched Hanno, at the head of a fleet of 60 ships, to explore and colonize the northwestern coast of Africa. He sailed west from Carthage toward the Iberian Peninsula, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar and founding or repopulating seven colonies along the coast of (what is now) Morocco. He then continued at least some distance further south along the continent&#x27;s Atlantic coast, allegedly encountering various indigenous peoples along his way, who met the fleet with a range of &quot;welcomes&quot;.

The gold trade had been a vital foundation of the Carthaginian empire from the fifth century BC, and the desire to secure the gold route to West Africa may have been the original motivation for the exploration of sub-Saharan Africa.

A number of scholars have commented upon Hanno&#x27;s voyage, stating that, in many cases, the analyses have been to refine information and interpretation of the original account. William Smith points out that the complement of personnel totalled 30,000 men, and that the core mission included the intent to found Carthaginian (or in the older parlance &#x27;Libyophoenician&#x27;) towns. Other sources have questioned this high number of men, with some suggesting 5,000 to be a more accurate number. R.C.C. Law notes that &quot;It is a measure of the obscurity of the problem that while some commentators have argued that Hanno reached the Gabon area, others have taken him no further than southern Morocco.&quot;

Harden reports a consensus that the expedition reached at least as far as Senegal. Due to the vagueness of the &quot;Periplus&quot;, estimates for the voyage&#x27;s distance range from under to at least . Some agree he could have reached Gambia. However, Harden mentions disagreement as to the farthest limit of Hanno&#x27;s explorations: Sierra Leone, Cameroon, or Gabon. He notes the description of Mount Cameroon, a volcano, more closely matches Hanno&#x27;s description than Guinea&#x27;s Mount Kakoulima. Warmington prefers Mount Kakoulima, considering Mount Cameroon too &quot;distant&quot;.

French historian Raymond Mauny, in his 1955 article &quot;La navigation sur les côtes du Sahara pendant l&#x27;antiquité&quot;, argued that ancient navigators (Hanno, Euthymenes, Scylax, etc.) could not have sailed south along the Atlantic coast much farther than Cape Bojador, in the territory of Western Sahara. Carthage, reportedly, knew of and conducted some trade with the peoples of the Canary Islands; ancient geographers were aware of the archipelago, as well, though nothing further south. Ships with square sails, without a stern rudder, might navigate south, but the winds and currents throughout the year would complicate or prevent the return trip from Senegal to Morocco. Oared ships might be able to achieve the return northward, but only with very great difficulties and a large crew. Mauny assumed that Hanno did not get farther than the mouth of the river Drâa, attributing artifacts found on Mogador Island to the expedition described in the &quot;Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax&quot; (dated mid-4th century BC) and noting that no evidence of Mediterranean trade further south had yet been found. The author ends by suggesting archaeological investigations of the islands along the coast, such as Cape Verde, or the île de Herné (&#x27;Dragon Island&#x27;, near Dakhla, Western Sahara) where ancient adventurers may have been stranded and settled.

===Gorillai ===

The end of the &quot;periplus&quot; describes an island populated with hairy and savage people. Attempts to capture the men failed. Three of the women were taken, but were so ferocious that they were killed, their skins brought home to Carthage. The skins were kept in the Temple of Juno (Tanit or Astarte) on Hanno&#x27;s return and, according to Pliny the Elder, survived until the Roman destruction of Carthage in 146 BC, some 350 years after Hanno&#x27;s expedition.

Hanno&#x27;s interpreters of an African tribe (Lixites or Nasamonians) called the people &quot;Gorillai&quot; (in Greek, ). In 1847, the gorilla, an ape species, was scientifically described and named after the &quot;Gorillai&quot;. The authors did not affirmatively identify Hanno&#x27;s &quot;Gorillai&quot; as the gorilla.

== Ancient authors&#x27; accounts ==
The text was known to the Roman Pliny the Elder (c. 23–79) and the Greek Arrian of Nicomedia (c. 86–160).

=== Pliny the Elder ===
Pliny may have recorded the time vaguely because he was ignorant of the actual date. His claim that Hanno completely circumnavigated Africa, reaching Arabia, is considered unrealistic by contemporary scholarship.

=== Arrian ===
Arrian mentions Hanno&#x27;s voyage at the end of his &quot;Anabasis of Alexander&quot; VIII (Indica):
=== Herodotus ===
Greek historian Herodotus, writing around 430 BC, described Carthaginian trade on the Moroccan coast (&quot;Histories&quot; 4.196), though it is doubtful whether he was aware of Hanno&#x27;s voyage itself.

== Legacy ==
===Modern===
The lunar crater Hanno is named after him.

== Historiography ==

In the 16th century, the voyage of Hanno saw increased scholarly interest from Europeans in an age when European exploration and navigation were flourishing. Already then, the extent of Hanno&#x27;s voyage was debated.

<doc id="328579" wikidata="Q422137" url="?curid=328579" title="Steroid hormone">
<text>A steroid hormone is a steroid that acts as a hormone. Steroid hormones can be grouped into two classes: corticosteroids (typically made in the adrenal cortex, hence &quot;cortico-&quot;) and sex steroids (typically made in the gonads or placenta). Within those two classes are five types according to the receptors to which they bind: glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (both corticosteroids) and androgens, estrogens, and progestogens (sex steroids). Vitamin D derivatives are a sixth closely related hormone system with homologous receptors. They have some of the characteristics of true steroids as receptor ligands.

Steroid hormones help control metabolism, inflammation, immune functions, salt and water balance, development of sexual characteristics, and the ability to withstand injury and illness. The term steroid describes both hormones produced by the body and artificially produced medications that duplicate the action for the naturally occurring steroids.

==Synthesis==

The natural steroid hormones are generally synthesized from cholesterol in the gonads and adrenal glands. These forms of hormones are lipids. They can pass through the cell membrane as they are fat-soluble, and then bind to steroid hormone receptors (which may be nuclear or cytosolic depending on the steroid hormone) to bring about changes within the cell. Steroid hormones are generally carried in the blood, bound to specific carrier proteins such as sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin. Further conversions and catabolism occurs in the liver, in other &quot;peripheral&quot; tissues, and in the target tissues.

===Synthetic steroids and sterols===
A variety of synthetic steroids and sterols have also been contrived. Most are steroids, but some nonsteroidal molecules can interact with the steroid receptors because of a similarity of shape. Some synthetic steroids are weaker or stronger than the natural steroids whose receptors they activate.

Some examples of synthetic steroid hormones:

* Glucocorticoids: alclometasone, prednisone, dexamethasone, triamcinolone, cortisone
* Mineralocorticoid: fludrocortisone
* Vitamin D: dihydrotachysterol
* Androgens: oxandrolone, oxabolone, nandrolone (also known as anabolic-androgenic steroids or simply anabolic steroids)
* Oestrogens: diethylstilbestrol (DES) and ethinyl estradiol (EE)
* Progestins: norethisterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate.

Some steroid antagonists:

* Androgen: cyproterone acetate
* Progestins: mifepristone, gestrinone

==Transport==

Steroid hormones are transported through the blood by being bound to carrier proteins—serum proteins that bind them and increase the hormones&#x27; solubility in water. Some examples are sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticosteroid-binding globulin, and albumin. Most studies say that hormones can only affect cells when they are not bound by serum proteins. In order to be active, steroid hormones must free themselves from their blood-solubilizing proteins and either bind to extracellular receptors, or passively cross the cell membrane and bind to nuclear receptors. This idea is known as the free hormone hypothesis. This idea is shown in Figure 1 to the right.

One study has found that these steroid-carrier complexes are bound by megalin, a membrane receptor, and are then taken into cells via endocytosis. One possible pathway is that once inside the cell these complexes are taken to the lysosome, where the carrier protein is degraded and the steroid hormone is released into the cytoplasm of the target cell. The hormone then follows a genomic pathway of action. This process is shown in Figure 2 to the right. The role of endocytosis in steroid hormone transport is not well understood and is under further investigation.

In order for steroid hormones to cross the lipid bilayer of cells, they must overcome energetic barriers that would prevent their entering or exiting the membrane. Gibbs free energy is an important concept here. These hormones, which are all derived from cholesterol, have hydrophilic functional groups at either end and hydrophobic carbon backbones. When steroid hormones are entering membranes free energy barriers exist when the functional groups are entering the hydrophobic interior of membrane, but it is energetically favorable for the hydrophobic core of these hormones to enter lipid bilayers. These energy barriers and wells are reversed for hormones exiting membranes. Steroid hormones easily enter and exit the membrane at physiologic conditions. They have been shown experimentally to cross membranes near a rate of 20 μm/s, depending on the hormone.

Though it is energetically more favorable for hormones to be in the membrane than in the ECF or ICF, they do in fact leave the membrane once they have entered it. This is an important consideration because cholesterol—the precursor to all steroid hormones—does not leave the membrane once it has embedded itself inside. The difference between cholesterol and these hormones is that cholesterol is in a much larger negative Gibb&#x27;s free energy well once inside the membrane, as compared to these hormones. This is because the aliphatic tail on cholesterol has a very favorable interaction with the interior of lipid bilayers.

==Mechanisms of action and effects==

There are many different mechanisms through which steroid hormones affect their target cells. All of these different pathways can be classified as having either a genomic effect or a non-genomic effect. Genomic pathways are slow and result in altering transcription levels of certain proteins in the cell; non-genomic pathways are much faster.
===Genomic pathways===

The first identified mechanisms of steroid hormone action were the genomic effects. In this pathway, the free hormones first pass through the cell membrane because they are fat soluble. In the cytoplasm, the steroid may or may not undergo an enzyme-mediated alteration such as reduction, hydroxylation, or aromatization. Then the steroid binds to a specific steroid hormone receptor, also known as a nuclear receptor, which is a large metalloprotein. Upon steroid binding, many kinds of steroid receptors dimerize: two receptor subunits join together to form one functional DNA-binding unit that can enter the cell nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the steroid-receptor ligand complex binds to specific DNA sequences and induces transcription of its target genes.

===Non-genomic pathways===
Because non-genomic pathways include any mechanism that is not a genomic effect, there are various non-genomic pathways. However, all of these pathways are mediated by some type of steroid hormone receptor found at the plasma membrane. Ion channels, transporters, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), and membrane fluidity have all been shown to be affected by steroid hormones. Of these, GPCR linked proteins are the most common. For more information on these proteins and pathways, visit the steroid hormone receptor page.

<text>Glyphis is a genus in the family Carcharhinidae, commonly known as the river sharks. They live in rivers or coastal regions in and around south-east Asia, Africa and parts of Australia. 
==Taxonomy==
This genus contains only three extant species. Further species could easily remain undiscovered due to their secretive habits. This genus was thought to contain five different species, but recent studies on molecular data revealed that the species &quot;Glyphis gangeticus&quot; has an irregular distribution in the Indo-West Pacific region. The genus Glyphis is closest to the genus Lamiopsis.
===Species===
The recognized species in this genus are:
* &quot;Glyphis fowlerae&quot; (Borneo river shark) synonym of &quot;G. gangeticus&quot;
* &quot;Glyphis gangeticus&quot; (Ganges shark)
* &quot;Glyphis garricki&quot; (northern river shark)
* &quot;Glyphis glyphis&quot; (speartooth shark)
* &quot;Glyphis hastalis&quot; 
* &quot;Glyphis pagoda&quot; 
* &quot;Glyphis siamensis&quot; (Irrawaddy river shark) synonym of &quot;G. gangeticus&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
Their precise geographic range is uncertain, but the known species are documented in parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, New Guinea and Australia. Of the three currently described species, the Ganges shark is restricted to freshwater, while the northern river shark and the speartooth shark are found in coastal marine waters, as well. While the bull shark (&quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;) is sometimes called both the river shark and the Ganges shark, it should not be confused with the river sharks of the genus &quot;Glyphis&quot;. River sharks evolved to have their offspring in freshwater, therefore, making them safe to roam in the water while other sharks are able to survive in saltwater.

==Conservation==
River sharks remain very poorly known to researchers. River sharks were thought to be extinct until the end of the 20th century, when small populations were discovered in Borneo and Northern Australia. Now, they face a critically endangered status as they are so poorly studied, and people know very little about their population and life history.

&quot;Glyphis gangeticus&quot; uses the Ganges River as nursery grounds and the birthplace of many Ganges shark offspring, however the population has been severely diminished owing to a long history of fishing and other pollution-related issues in the Northern Arabian Sea. Additionally, India, where the Ganges river flows, is reported to be one of the top three greatest shark and ray capturers in the world, accounting for up to nine percent of reported global landings (Jabado et al., 2018). They are reported from the Zambezi river in Africa. They have been found in nine different tidal areas, which consist of muddy waters with a low salinity. Their placement in connection to coastal marine waters indicates that they are usually born around October.

<text>The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, officially designated Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, is the most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S. state of Texas and the Southern United States, encompassing 11 counties. Its historically dominant core cities are Dallas and Fort Worth. It is the economic and cultural hub of North Texas. Residents of the area also refer to it as DFW (the code for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport) or the Metroplex. The Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan statistical area&#x27;s population was 7,637,387 according to the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s 2020 census, making it the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. and the eleventh-largest in the Americas. In 2016, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex had the highest annual population growth in the United States. By 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area&#x27;s population had increased to 8,100,037, with the highest numerical growth of any metropolitan area in the United States.

The metropolitan region&#x27;s economy, also referred to as Silicon Prairie, is primarily based on banking, commerce, insurance, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, medical research, transportation, manufacturing, and logistics. As of 2022, Dallas–Fort Worth is home to 23 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies, the 4th-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the United States behind New York City (62), Chicago (35), and Houston (24). In 2016, the metropolitan economy surpassed Houston, the second largest metro area in Texas, to become the fourth-largest in the U.S. The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex boasted a GDP of just over $620.6 billion in 2020 (although both metropolitan regions have switched places multiple times since GDP began recording). If the Metroplex were a sovereign state, it would have the twentieth largest economy in the world as of 2019. In 2015, the conurbated metropolitan area would rank the ninth-largest economy if it were a U.S. state. In 2020, Dallas–Fort Worth was recognized as the 36th best metropolitan area for STEM professionals in the U.S.

The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex comprises the highest concentration of colleges and universities in Texas. The UT Southwestern Medical Center is home to six Nobel Laureates and was ranked No. 1 in the world among healthcare institutions in biomedical sciences. The Metroplex is also the second most popular metropolis for megachurches in Texas (trailing the Greater Houston metropolitan area), ranked the largest Christian metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., and has one of the largest LGBT communities in Texas since 2005.

== Etymology ==
A portmanteau of &quot;metropolis&quot; and &quot;complex&quot;, the term &quot;metroplex&quot; is credited to Harve Chapman, an executive vice president with Dallas-based Tracy-Locke, one of three advertising agencies that worked with the North Texas Commission (NTC) on strategies to market the region. The NTC copyrighted the term &quot;Southwest Metroplex&quot; in 1972 as a replacement for the previously-ubiquitous &quot;North Texas&quot;, which studies had shown lacked identifiability outside the state. In fact, only 38 percent of a survey group identified Dallas and Fort Worth as part of &quot;North Texas&quot;, with the Texas Panhandle also a perceived correct answer, being the northernmost region of Texas.

== Geography ==
The United States Census Bureau determined the Metroplex encompasses of total area; is land, and is covered by water. The conurbated metropolitan area is larger in area than the U.S. states of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined, and larger than New Jersey. If the metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would rank the 162nd largest state by total area after Lebanon. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget combines the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex with the Sherman–Denison metropolitan area and seven micropolitan statistical areas to form the Dallas–Fort Worth TX–OK combined statistical area.

The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex overlooks mostly prairie land with a few rolling hills dotted by human-made lakes cut by streams, creeks and rivers surrounded by forested land. The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex is situated in the Texas blackland prairies region, so named for its fertile black soil found especially in the rural areas of Collin, Dallas, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman, and Rockwall counties.

Many areas of Denton, Johnson, Parker, Tarrant, and Wise counties are located in the Fort Worth Prairie region of North Texas, which has less fertile and more rocky soil than that of the Texas blackland prairie; most of the rural land on the Fort Worth Prairie is ranch land. A large onshore natural gas field, the Barnett Shale, lies underneath this area; Denton, Tarrant and Wise counties feature many natural gas wells. Continuing land use change results in scattered crop fields surrounded by residential or commercial development. South of Dallas and Fort Worth is a line of rugged hills that goes north to south about that looks similar to the Texas Hill Country to the south.

=== Metropolitan divisions and counties ===
The Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan statistical area is formed by a combination of two separate metropolitan statistical divisions. The Dallas–Plano–Irving MDA and Fort Worth–Arlington–Grapevine MDA come together to form one full metropolitan area or conurbation.

Within the boundaries of the CSA the Census Bureau defines 31 other urban areas as well, some of which form the core of their own metro or micro statistical areas separate from the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan statistical area. Urban areas situated primarily outside the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan statistical area but within the CSA are identified with a cross (†) in the table below.

== Economy ==
The cities of Dallas and Fort Worth are the two central cities of the Metroplex, with Arlington being a third economically important city; it is a center for sporting events, tourism and manufacturing. Most other incorporated cities in the Metroplex are &quot;bedroom communities&quot; serving largely as residential and small-business centers, though there are several key employers in these regions. Due to the large number of smaller, less well-known cities, Metroplex residents commonly divide the region roughly in half along Texas Interstate 35, which runs north–south, splitting into two &#x27;branches&#x27; (I-35E in Dallas and I-35W in Fort Worth) through the Metroplex. They refer to places as being on the &quot;Dallas side&quot; or the &quot;Fort Worth side&quot;, or in &quot;the Arlington area&quot;, which is almost directly south of the airport; cities in the Arlington area form the Mid-Cities. It is nominally between the two major east–west interstates in the region (I-20, passing to the south of both downtowns, and I-30, connecting Dallas and Fort Worth city centers).

Business management and operations play a central role in the area&#x27;s economy. Dallas and its suburbs have the third-largest concentration of corporate headquarters in the United States. Moreover, it is the only metro area in the country home to three of the top-ten largest Fortune 500 companies by revenue. The area continues to draw corporate relocation from across the nation, and especially from California. From late 2018 to early 2019, both McKesson and Charles Schwab announced they would be relocating from San Francisco to the DFW area. Later in 2019, San Francisco-based Uber announced a massive corporate expansion just east of downtown Dallas.

Banking and finance play a key role in the area&#x27;s economy. DFW recently surpassed Chicago to become the second-largest financial services hub in the nation, eclipsed only by New York. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Liberty Mutual, Goldman Sachs, State Farm, Charles Schwab Corporation, and Fidelity Investments maintain significant operations in the area. The Metroplex also contains the largest Information Technology industry base in the state (often referred to as Silicon Prairie or the Telecom Corridor, especially when referring to US-75 through Richardson, Plano and Allen just north of Dallas itself). This area has a large number of corporate IT projects and the presence of numerous electronics, computing and telecommunication firms such as Microsoft, Texas Instruments, HP Enterprise Services, Dell Services, Samsung, Nokia, Cisco, Fujitsu, i2, Frontier, Alcatel, Ericsson, CA, Google, T-Mobile US, and Verizon. AT&amp;T, the second largest telecommunications company in the world, is headquartered at the Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas. ExxonMobil and McKesson, respectively the 2nd and 7th largest Fortune 500 companies by revenue, are headquartered in Irving, Texas. Fluor, the largest engineering &amp; construction company in the Fortune 500, is also headquartered in Irving. In October 2016, Jacobs Engineering, a Fortune 500 company and one of the world&#x27;s largest engineering companies, relocated from Pasadena, California to Dallas. Toyota USA, in 2016, relocated its corporate headquarters to Plano, Texas. Southwest Airlines is headquartered in Dallas. The airline has more than 53,000 employees as of October 2016 and operates more than 3,900 departures a day during peak travel season.

On the other side of the Metroplex, the Texas farming and ranching industry is based in Fort Worth, though the area&#x27;s economy is diverse. American Airlines, the largest airline in the world, recently completed their new $350M corporate HQ complex in Fort Worth. American Airlines is also the largest employer in the Metroplex. Several major defense manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter Textron, and Raytheon, maintain significant operations in the Metroplex, primarily on the &quot;Fort Worth side&quot;. They are concentrated along State Highway 170 near I-35W, commonly called the &quot;Alliance Corridor&quot; due to its proximity to the Fort Worth Alliance regional airport.

Changes in house prices for the Metroplex are publicly tracked on a regular basis using the Case–Shiller index; the statistic is published by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and is also a component of S&amp;P&#x27;s 20-city composite index of the value of the U.S. residential real estate market.

== Sports ==
The Metroplex is one of the 12 U.S. metropolitan areas that has a team in each of the four major professional sports leagues. Major professional sports first came to the area in 1952, when the Dallas Texans competed in the National Football League for one season. In 1960, major professional sports returned when the Dallas Cowboys began competing in the National Football League and the Dallas Texans began competing in the American Football League. The Dallas Texans later relocated to Kansas City and became the Chiefs. In 1972, Major League Baseball&#x27;s Washington Senators moved to Arlington to become the Texas Rangers, named after the statewide law enforcement agency. The National Basketball Association expanded into North Texas in 1980 when the Dallas Mavericks were added to the league. The fourth sport was added in 1993 when the Minnesota North Stars of the National Hockey League moved to Dallas, becoming the Dallas Stars.

The Major League Soccer team FC Dallas is based in Frisco, and the Dallas Wings of the WNBA play in Arlington. The area is also home to many minor-league professional teams, and four colleges that compete in NCAA Division I athletics. A NASCAR Cup Series race is hosted annually at Texas Motor Speedway, the AAA Texas 500, and two PGA Tour events are held annually in the Metroplex, the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson and the Colonial National Invitation Tournament. The Metroplex has hosted many premiere sports events on both an annual and one-time basis.

== Politics ==

The Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is the most populous Republican-leaning metropolitan area in the country. However, since 2016 Democrats have been making inroads in the area&#x27;s suburbs. As of 2024, both the mayor of Dallas (elected as a Democrat) and the mayor of Fort Worth are Republicans, with Dallas being the largest city in the United States to have a Republican mayor.

The Republican Party has historically been dominant in the Dallas–Fort Worth area, including in presidential elections. Democrats have consistently won Dallas County since 2008. In 2020, Joe Biden narrowly won Tarrant County, whose county seat is Fort Worth, marking the first time since 1964 that the Democratic candidate had carried the county.

== Media ==
The cities of Dallas and Fort Worth have their own newspapers, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; and the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;, respectively. Historically, the two papers had readership primarily in their own counties. As the two cities&#x27; suburbs have grown together in recent years (and especially since the demise of the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; in 1991), many sites sell both papers. This pattern of crossover has been repeated in other print media, radio, and television.

Since the 1970s all of the television stations and most of the FM radio stations have chosen to transmit from Cedar Hill so as to serve the entire market, and are programmed likewise. There has been a rise in &quot;80–90 move-ins&quot;, whereby stations have been moved from distant markets, in some cases as far away as Oklahoma, and relicensed to anonymous small towns in the Metroplex to serve as additional DFW stations. According to &quot;RadioTime,&quot; the market had 38 AM stations, 58 FM stations (many of them class Cs), and 18 full-power television stations. Per another study the area has a total of 62 FM stations and 40 AM stations as of 2020.

Dallas–Fort Worth is the fifth-largest television market in the United States, behind only New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Two of the Metroplex&#x27;s AM radio stations, 820 WBAP and 1080 KRLD, are 50,000-watt stations with coverage of much of the North American continent and beyond during nighttime hours. The South Asian population (Indian Sub-continent) has increased considerably in the DFW metroplex. They have the FM 104.9 radio channel and 700 AM radio. Recently Sony TV, a subsidiary of Sony TV Asia, launched its FTA (free to Air OTA) channel on 44.2 station in DFW. It was one of the two locations they chose in the United States, the other being New York City, where there is also a large South Asian demographic.

==Transportation==
===Air travel===

The Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (IATA airport code: DFW), located between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, is the largest and busiest airport in the state of Texas. At of total land area, DFW is also the second-largest airport in the country and the sixth-largest in the world. It is the third-busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft movements and the world&#x27;s seventh-busiest by passenger traffic, transporting 62.9 million passengers in FY 2014. Based in Fort Worth, American Airlines&#x27; headquarters are adjacent to DFW. Recently having regained the title as the largest airline in the world in terms of both passengers transported and fleet size, American is a predominant leader in domestic routes and operations.

The Dallas Love Field Airport (IATA airport code: DAL) is located in northwest Dallas. Based in Dallas, Southwest Airlines is headquartered next to Love Field.

===Freeways===

The Dallas–Fort Worth area has thousands of lane-miles of freeways and interstates. The Metroplex has the second-largest number of freeway-miles per capita in the nation, behind only the Kansas City metropolitan area. As in most major metropolitan areas in Texas, most interstates and freeways have access or frontage roads where most of the businesses are located; these access roads have slip ramps allowing traffic to transition between the freeway and access road. North–south interstates include I-35 and I-45. East–west routes include I-30 and I-20. I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W from Denton to Hillsboro: I-35W goes through Fort Worth while I-35E goes through Dallas. (This is one of only two examples of an interstate splitting off into branches and then rejoining as one; the other such split is in Minneapolis-St. Paul where I-35E goes into St. Paul and I-35W goes through Minneapolis.) I-30 connects Dallas and Fort Worth, and I-45 connects Dallas to Houston. The &quot;multiple-of-5&quot; numbers used for the interstate designations are notable, as these numbers were designed to be used for major multi-state arteries of the U.S. Interstate Highway System. The North Texas region is the terminus for two of them, and I-45 is located only within Texas.

HOV lanes exist along I-35E, I-30, I-635, US 67, and US 75. I-20 bypasses both Dallas and Fort Worth to the south while its loop, I-820, goes around Fort Worth. I-635 splits to the north of I-20 and loops around east and north Dallas, ending at SH 121 north of DFW Airport. I-35E, Loop 12, and Spur 408 ultimately connect to I-20 southwest of Dallas, completing the west bypass loop around Dallas. A large number of construction projects are planned or are already underway in the region to alleviate congestion. Due largely to funding issues, many of the new projects involve building new tollways or adding tolled express lanes to existing highways, which are managed by the North Texas Tollway Authority. It was originally established to manage the Dallas North Tollway and oversees several other toll projects in the area.

===Public transit===
Public transit options continue to expand significantly throughout the Metroplex. However, it is limited in several outlying and rural suburbs. Dallas County and portions of Collin and Rockwall counties have bus service and light rail operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), covering thirteen member cities. DART&#x27;s rail network currently sprawls for 93 miles throughout the area. The Red Line extends north to Plano and southwest to Oak Cliff. The Blue Line reaches from Rowlett in the northeast to the University of North Texas at Dallas campus near I-20 in the south. The 28-mile Green Line, which opened in December 2010, connects Carrollton in the northwest through downtown Dallas to Pleasant Grove in the southeast. The Orange Line, which completed expansion in 2014, parallels the Red Line from Plano to downtown Dallas and the Green Line from downtown Dallas to Northwest Hwy before extending through the Las Colinas area of Irving to reach DFW International Airport.

Denton County has bus service limited to Denton, Highland Village, and Lewisville (with commuter service to downtown Dallas) provided by the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA). The A-train, a diesel commuter rail line, parallels I-35E to connect Denton, Highland Village, Lewisville, and Carrollton. Several smaller towns along this line, Corinth, Shady Shores, and Lake Dallas, voted to abstain from DCTA and do not have stations. There is an across-the-platform transfer in Carrollton to the DART Green Line. A-Train service began June 20, 2011.

Tarrant County has bus services operated by Trinity Metro (formerly the Fort Worth Transportation Authority, popularly known as &#x27;The T&#x27;), available only in Fort Worth. It additionally operates TEXRail commuter rail, which serves to connect downtown Fort Worth with DFW Airport and the DART Orange Line. The diesel commuter train that serves Fort Worth and its eastern suburbs is operated as the Trinity Railway Express; it connects downtown Fort Worth to downtown Dallas, where it links to the DART light rail system. A station near its midpoint, Centerport, also serves DFW Airport via a free airport shuttle bus. The TRE is jointly owned by FWTA and DART. Amtrak serves two stations in the Metroplex—Dallas Union Station and Fort Worth Central Station. Both are served by the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; route, which operates daily between Chicago and San Antonio (continuing on to Los Angeles three days a week), though only Fort Worth is served by the Fort Worth-Oklahoma City &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot;.

As of 2016 the Taiwanese airline EVA Air operates a shuttle bus service from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston to Richardson, so that Dallas-based customers may fly on its services to and from Houston.

<text>Midland is a town located on Georgian Bay in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. It is part of the Huronia/Wendat region of Central Ontario.

Located at the southern end of Georgian Bay&#x27;s 30,000 Islands, Midland is the economic centre of the region, with a 125-bed hospital and a local airport (Midland/Huronia Airport). It is the main town of the southern Georgian Bay area. In the summer months, the area&#x27;s population grows to over 100,000 with seasonal visitors to more than 8,000 cottages, resort hotels, provincial and national parks in the surrounding municipalities of Penetanguishene, Tiny, Tay, and Beausoleil First Nation.

== History ==

The town of Midland was founded when, in 1871, the Midland Railway of Canada selected the sparsely populated community of Mundy&#x27;s Bay as the new terminus of the Midland railway. At that time the Midland railway ran from Port Hope to Beaverton. The town site was surveyed in 1872–3 and the line to the town was completed by 1879. Settlers, attracted by the convenience of rail service, soon began to move into the area. The company sold off lots in town (Midland City) to help finance the settlement. The village (incorporated in 1878) thrived based on Georgian Bay shipping and the lumber and grain trade. Incorporated into a town in 1890, a number of light industrial companies have established themselves in the area and tourism in the southern Georgian Bay area also contributes to the economy.

=== 2010 tornado ===

On June 23, 2010, Midland was struck by an F2 tornado, causing $15 million in damage. The most significant damage was reported at Smith&#x27;s Camp, a trailer park at the south end of the town, where several mobile homes were completely destroyed. At one point, for the first time in 25 years, Emergency Management Ontario upgraded Environment Canada&#x27;s tornado warning to an extreme severe weather warning called &quot;Red Alert&quot; which was issued for most of Southern Ontario&#x27;s cottage country due to the approaching severe weather and the possibility of violent tornadoes, informing residents in the area that they should seek shelter. In addition, a State of emergency was also declared in Midland. While electrical service was knocked out for a time, there were no fatalities caused by the storm.

== Geography and climate ==

Midland is located at the south end of the Georgian Bay and is the northern anchor of the Simcoe County.

Midland has a humid continental climate under the Köppen climate classification (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) and has four distinct seasons. The climate is nearly the same as much of Southern Ontario and has balmy summers and chilly winters. Thunderstorms, hailstorms, snowstorm, lake effect snow and freezing rain are also common for this city.

== Local attractions ==

Around the centre of Midland there are a number of murals, most of which were painted by now deceased artist Fred Lenz. The largest, depicting a meeting between a local native and Jesuit missionary Jean de Brebeuf is on the silos overlooking the main harbour. This work was completed by Lenz&#x27;s sons following his death in 2001.

Notable sites in or near Midland include the Jesuit mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, which is now a living museum depicting missionary life in the 17th century. The Martyrs&#x27; Shrine is a Roman Catholic church commemorating the Canadian Martyrs, eight missionaries from Sainte-Marie who were martyred during the Huron-Iroquois wars. Pope John Paul II held a pastoral meeting at this site in September 1984.

The Huronia Museum is a history and art museum which features the Huron Village, a reconstruction of a typical Huron/Ouendat (Wendat) village.

The Wye Marsh Wildlife Centre is nearby. The marsh provides habitat for trumpeter swans, black terns and least bitterns. The trumpeter swan is considered a symbol of Midland and a large statue of one has been erected by the harbour.

An annual Butter tart festival, inaugurated in 2013, is held in early June. In 2016, the fourth annual Butter tart Festival sold more 100,000 butter tarts. Many tourists flock to Midland during the festival. There are two divisions: amateur and commercial. The day after the Butter tart festival is the Butter Tart Trot, a 5-km fun run for older people and a 2.5-km run for children under 5 years old.

Little Lake Park is a tourist destination in the summer months. The park has a refreshment stand and a number of sports facilities including volleyball courts, a baseball field, skateboard park, disc golf course.

The Midland Cultural Centre is a hub for various cultural activities, located in the core of downtown Midland. The Centre is home to the Huronia Players, Quest Art School and Gallery, and Rotary Hall.

== Sports activities ==

Midland is the home of The Midland Flyers Ice Hockey Club of the Provincial Junior Hockey League in the Carruthers division in the Ontario Hockey Association. It is also the home of the Midland Minor Hockey Association. Midland North Simcoe Sports &amp; Recreation Centre is the home rink of these teams. The NSSRC is also the location of the Midland Sports Hall of Fame.

Boating, both power and sail, is very popular with several marinas and a sailing club based in the town. The town has easy access to the relatively sheltered waters of southeastern Georgian Bay. Among the marinas nearby are Bay Port Yachting Centre on the northwest side of the bay, and Wye Heritage Marina along the southeast shore. There is also good fishing.

Midland also has an ever-growing and active cycling base. The Midland Tri Club has increased the number of road riders in the area. Many of these riders also participate in the popular weekly Time Trial series and group rides throughout the summer months. Mountain View Ski Centre has also encouraged the growth of mountain bikers, with an extensive trail system in town. The Centre hosts a variety of races, including a summer-long weekly series, as well as a night race, high school event, and 9-hour relay. Also, an MTB club has been borne of the Centre, expanding its breadth into competition and other pursuits. The provincial cyclo-cross championships will be hosted in Midland on November 13, 2016, as part of the Silver Goose CX Race.

In the winter, snowmobiling and ice fishing are popular activities. Mountain-view Ski Centre has of cross-country ski trails.

==History==
The area around Hiratsuka has been settled since prehistoric times, and mention of the area as part of ancient Ōsumi District, Sagami Province is found in Nara period records. From the Heian period through Kamakura period, the area was divided into &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by various samurai clans and in the Sengoku period was the site of several battles between the later Hōjō clan of Odawara and the Miura clan. After the defeat of the Odawara at the Battle of Odawara by Hideyoshi Toyotomi, the area came under the control of Ieyasu Tokugawa, who built a summer palace (the &quot;Nakahara Goten&quot;) in 1596 at the site now occupied by the Hiratsuka City Nakahara Elementary/Primary School. Hiratsuka was retained as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory after the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, and flourished as Hiratsuka-juku, a post town on the Tōkaidō connecting Edo with Kyoto. As the 7th station, it is often depicted in the series of ukiyo-e about the 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō made among others by artists such Hokusai and Hiroshige.

After the Meiji Restoration, Hiratsuka town was founded on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the municipalities system, as part of the new Naka District within Kanagawa Prefecture. It merged with neighboring Suma Town on April 1, 1929, and was proclaimed Hiratsuka City on April 1, 1932.

The city quickly rebuilt after the war, annexing several neighboring villages in the mid-1950s to attain its current area. The population exceeded 200,000 by 2001 and Hiratsuka became a special city with increased autonomy from the central government.

<text>is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 439,728 and a population density of 6300 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Fujisawa is in the south-central part of Kanagawa Prefecture. It faces Sagami Bay of the Pacific Ocean. The northern part of the city is on the Sagamino plateau while the southern part is abutted on the Shonan Beach.

Fujisawa has three major topographical features: the island of Enoshima to the south connected to the Katase shoreline area by a road bridge, and two rivers, the Hikiji and the Sakai, which run north-south. The Hikiji can be traced from an area designated as a nature reserve park in the city of Yamato and flows directly along the boundary of the joint US Navy and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Atsugi Naval Air Base and the United States Army Camp Zama. The Sakai runs directly from the mountains between Machida and Hachiōji, and for quite some distance forms the border between the Tokyo Metropolitan Area and Kanagawa Prefecture. From Machida city centre, the river can be directly followed by a foot and cycle path to Fujisawa city centre, a distance of approximately . Another cycle path runs along the Shonan Coastal path, from the Sagami River, in Hiratsuka, to Enoshima Bridge in Fujisawa.

The average annual rainfall is 1872 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.4 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Fujisawa has grown steadily over the past 70 years.

==History==
The area around present-day Fujisawa City has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools and shell middens from the Japanese Paleolithic period, ceramic shards from the Jōmon period, and graves from the Kofun period at numerous locations. The area is mentioned in the Nara period chronicles. By the Heian period, central Sagami Province was divided into &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by the Muroaoka, Oe, and other local warlords. During the Kamakura period, Fujisawa was the setting for a number of battles to overthrow the Kamakura shogunate as mentioned in the late 14th century Taiheiki. During the Muromachi period, Fujisawa developed around Yugyo-ji, a Buddhist temple, which was established in 1325.

With the Edo period, Fujisawa prospered as Fujisawa-shuku, a post station on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. &quot;Shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu built a palace in Fujisawa as a rest stop between Edo and Sunpu.

Following the Meiji Restoration, the area was divided into villages in Kōza District and Kamakura District within Kanagawa Prefecture. The Kōza District office was located in Fujisawa from 1878. The area developed rapidly after the opening of Fujisawa Station of Tōkaidō Main Line in 1887.

During the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, Fujisawa-Ōsaka Town (in Kōza District) and Fujisawa-Ōtomi Town (in Kamakura District) were created through the merger of local hamlets. Emperor Meiji visited Fujisawa in 1891 to watch military maneuvers. The IJA 49th Infantry Regiment under the IJA 1st Division was stationed in Fujisawa from 1907. During the same year, Fujisawa-Ōsaka Town absorbed Fujisawa-Ōtomi Town and expanded further in 1908 by annexing the neighboring villages of Kugenuma and Meiji (both from Kamakura District), renaming itself Fujisawa Town.

The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused severe damage to Fujisawa, with some 4,000 houses destroyed. An Imperial Japanese Navy Artillery School was established in Tsujido in 1926.

The town of Fujisawa was elevated to city status on October 1, 1940. Fujisawa expanded by annexing the village of Muraoka in 1941, the village of Mutsuai in 1942, the town of Katase in 1947, and the villages of Goshomi, Chogo, Takakura and parts of Koide (hamlet of Endo) in 1955. Fujisawa hosted the yachting events of the 1964 Summer Olympics. 

These improved transport links, such as the Yokohama Subway line and express train services on the Odakyu line, have made Fujisawa an increasingly attractive and cost-effective commuter suburb for Tokyo and Yokohama.

==Government==
Fujisawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 36 members. Fujisawa contributes five members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 12th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Fujisawa has a mixed economy with a strong industrial base. Isuzu retains a large truck factory at Tsuchidana. Kobe Steel has a factory in the east of the city, as does NSK Microprecision, a maker of bearings and precision parts. Sony operates the Shonan Technology Center in Fujisawa. Ebara Corporation, a major manufacturer of pumps and water treatment equipment has a plant in Fujisawa.

Fujisawa has extensive commercial shopping facilities and has the largest commercial city centre on the Shonan coast. Fujisawa is also a bedroom community for Yokohama and Tokyo.

== Education ==
There are four university campuses in Fujisawa: Keio University&#x27;s Shonan Fujisawa Campus (SFC) with three faculties and a graduate school in Endo, Nihon University&#x27;s School of Natural Science at Mutsuai, and Tama University&#x27;s Global Studies Faculty near Shonandai, all in the northern part of the city, and the Shonan Institute of Technology (SIT) in Tsujido Nishikaigan to the south.

Fujisawa has 35 public elementary schools and 19 public middle schools as well as one private elementary school and six private combined middle/high schools, including the Shonan Shirayuri Gakuen Junior High School and High School and Keio Shonan-Fujisawa Junior and Senior High School. The city has six public high schools operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education, including Shonan High School, one of the leading high schools in Kanagawa with former Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara as a graduate.

<text>Neville Thomas Bonner AO (28 March 19225 February 1999) was an Australian politician, and the first Aboriginal Australian to become a member of the Parliament of Australia. He was appointed by the Queensland Parliament to fill a casual vacancy in the representation of Queensland in the Senate, and later became the first Indigenous Australian to be elected to the parliament by popular vote. Neville Bonner was an elder of the Jagera people.

==Early life==
Bonner was born on 28 March 1922 on Ukerebagh Island, a small island in the Tweed River of New South Wales close to the border with Queensland. He was the son of Julia Bell, an Indigenous Australian, and Henry Kenneth Bonner, an English immigrant. His maternal grandmother Ida Sandy was a member of the Ugarapul people of the Logan and Albert Rivers, while his maternal grandfather Roger Bell (or Jung Jung) was a fully initiated member of the Yagara people of the Brisbane River. According to Bonner, his grandfather was &quot;sort of captured ... out of the tribe&quot; as a young boy and given an English name.

Bonner&#x27;s parents met and married in Murwillumbah, New South Wales. His father abandoned his mother when she was pregnant with him, leaving her destitute. She subsequently moved to the Aboriginal reserve on Ukerebagh Island, where she had another son. After about five years, the family moved near Lismore, New South Wales, to be closer to Bonner&#x27;s grandparents, living on the banks of the Richmond River under a lantana bush. His mother subsequently had three children with Frank Randell, an Aboriginal man who was employed by the local police. One of his half-brothers died as a child and he &quot;witnessed frequent acts of violence by Randell against his mother&quot;.

Bonner&#x27;s mother died in July 1932, when he was ten years old, and his grandmother subsequently became his main caregiver. She moved the family to Beaudesert, Queensland, where in 1935 he completed his only year of formal education at Beaudesert State Rural School. His grandmother died in June 1935 and he moved back to New South Wales after finishing the school year. Bonner worked as a ring barker, cane cutter and stockman before settling on Palm Island, near Townsville, Queensland in 1946, where he rose to the position of Assistant Settlement Overseer.

==Politics==
In 1960 he lived in Ipswich, where he joined the board of directors of the One People of Australia League (OPAL), a moderate Indigenous rights organisation. He became its Queensland president in 1970. He joined the Liberal Party in 1967 and held local office in the party. Following the resignation of Senator Annabelle Rankin in 1971, Bonner was chosen to fill the casual vacancy and he became the first Indigenous Australian to sit in the Australian Parliament. He was elected in his own right in 1972, 1974, 1975, and 1980.

While in the Senate he served on a number of committees but was never a serious candidate for promotion to the ministry. He rebelled against the Liberal Party line on some issues. Partly as a result of this, and partly due to pressure from younger candidates, he was dropped from the Liberal Senate ticket at the 1983 election. He stood as an independent and was nearly successful. The Hawke government then appointed him to the board of directors of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

In 1981 Bonner was the only government voice opposing a bill put forth that would allow drilling in the Great Barrier Reef. He regularly crossed the floor on bills, a characteristic that has endeared him to politicians today but is often considered the reason for his political career coming to an end.

==Later life==
Following Bonner&#x27;s electoral defeat, incoming ALP prime minister Bob Hawke publicly promised him a government post. In June 1983 he was appointed to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). He briefly acted as ABC chairman in April 1984, and in June 1986 was reappointed to a further five-year term on the board, concluding in 1991.

From 1992 to 1996 he was member of the Griffith University Council. The university awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1993. In 1998 he was elected to the Constitutional Convention as a candidate of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy.

In 1998 Bonner announced he had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He died at a hospice in Ipswich on 5 February 1999, aged 76. He was granted a state funeral, held at St Stephen&#x27;s Church, and interred at Warrill Park Lawn Cemetery.

==Honours and legacy==
In 1979 Bonner was jointly named Australian of the Year, along with naturalist Harry Butler. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1984. 

The head office of the Queensland Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability services in Brisbane, built in 1999, was named the Neville Bonner Building. Despite having won two architectural awards (the RAIA Beatrice Hutton Award for Commercial Building 1999, a national award, and the RAIA (Queensland) F.D.G Stanley Award &amp; Regional Commendation 1999), it was demolished in 2017 to make way for the Queen&#x27;s Wharf development. The Neville Bonner Bridge, a footbridge built in 2023, and opened in August 2024, is part of the new development.

The Neville Bonner Memorial Scholarship was established by the federal government in 2000, a scholarship for Indigenous Australians to study Honours in political science or related subjects at any recognised Australian university.

In 2002, the Neville Bonner Award for Indigenous Education was introduced as part of the Australian Awards for University Teaching (AAUT), which were established by the federal government in 1997. The inaugural award was won jointly by Marcia Langton and Larissa Behrendt.

A multipurpose 47-bed hostel, managed by Aboriginal Hostels Limited, located in the Rockhampton suburb of Berserker, was redeveloped and reopened in July 2002 as the Neville Bonner Hostel. 

The Queensland federal electorate of Bonner was created in 2004 and was named in his honour.

The suburb of Bonner in Canberra, created around 2008, bears his name.

== Personal life ==
Bonner married Mona Banfield in 1943, in a Catholic ceremony at Palm Island&#x27;s mission. They had five sons and fostered three daughters, prior to Mona&#x27;s death in 1969. Bonner remarried in 1972 to Heather Ryan (), who had three adult children. His great-niece Joanna Lindgren was appointed to the Senate in 2015.

Bonner was taught to make boomerangs by his grandfather. In 1966, he established a boomerang manufacturing business named Bonnerang, with the assistance of his family. The boomerangs were handmade from the roots of black wattle trees, as Bonner refused to use synthetic materials. His company produced up to 450 boomerangs per week, but folded after a year due to a shortage of wood. After being elected to parliament, Bonner gave a boomerang demonstration in the gardens of Parliament House. In his maiden speech he called on the intellectual property of the boomerang to be reserved for Indigenous people, as non-Indigenous people were producing cheap synthetic properties. One of his boomerangs is held by the Museum of Australian Democracy.

<doc id="328602" wikidata="Q568942" url="?curid=328602" title="Ansari X Prize">
<text>The Ansari X Prize was a space competition in which the X Prize Foundation offered a US$10,000,000 prize for the first non-government organization to launch a reusable crewed spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. It was modeled after early 20th-century aviation prizes, and aimed to spur development of low-cost spaceflight.

Created in May 1996 and initially called just the &quot;X Prize&quot;, it was renamed the &quot;Ansari X Prize&quot; on May 6, 2004, following a multimillion-dollar donation from entrepreneurs Anousheh Ansari and Amir Ansari.

The prize was won on October 4, 2004, the 47th anniversary of the Sputnik 1 launch, by the Tier One project designed by Burt Rutan and financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, using the experimental spaceplane SpaceShipOne. $10 million was awarded to the winner, and more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize.

Several other X Prizes have since been announced by the X Prize Foundation, promoting further development in space exploration and other technological fields.

==Motivation==
The X Prize was inspired by the Orteig Prize—the 1919 prize worth 25,000 dollars offered by New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig that encouraged a number of intrepid aviators in the mid-1920s to fly across the Atlantic Ocean from New York to Paris—which was ultimately won in 1927 by Charles Lindbergh in his aircraft &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. In reading the 1953 book, &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; during 1994, Peter Diamandis realized that &quot;such a prize, updated and offered ... as a &quot;space&quot; prize, might be just what was needed to bring space travel to the general public, to jump-start a commercial space industry.&quot;

Diamandis developed a fully formed idea for a &quot;suborbital space barnstorming prize&quot;, and set an initial goal of finding backers to support a prize. He named it the X Prize, in part because &quot;X&quot; could serve as a variable for the name of the person who might later back the prize; any craft built to win the prize would be experimental, and a long line of experimental aircraft built for the US Air Force had been so designated, including the X-15 that was, in 1963, the first government-built craft to carry a human into space; and because &quot;Ten is the Roman numeral X&quot;.

The X Prize was publicly proposed by Diamandis in an address to the NSS International Space Development Conference in 1995. The competition goal was adopted from the SpaceCub project, demonstration of a private vehicle capable of flying a pilot to the edge of space, defined as 100 km altitude. This goal was selected to help encourage the space industry in the private sector, which is why the entries were not allowed to have any government funding. It aimed to demonstrate that spaceflight can be affordable and accessible to corporations and civilians, opening the door to commercial spaceflight and space tourism. It is also hoped that competition will breed innovation, introducing new low-cost methods of reaching Earth orbit, and ultimately pioneering low-cost space travel and unfettered human expansion into the Solar System.

NASA is developing a similar prize program called Centennial Challenges to generate innovative solutions to space technology problems.

==Contestants==
Twenty-six teams from around the world participated, ranging from volunteer hobbyists to large corporate-backed operations:
Some sources mention two other companies:
* AeroAstro*
* Cerulean Freight Forwarding Co.,
but do not mention Whalen Aeronautics Inc.

==Winning team==

The Tier One project made two successful competitive flights: X1 on September 29, 2004, piloted by Mike Melvill to 102.9 km; and X2 on October 4, 2004, piloted by Brian Binnie to 112 km. They thus won the prize, which was awarded on November 6, 2004. In press coverage, the winning team has been variously referred to as Mojave Aerospace Ventures, the corporation that funded the attempt; Tier One, the project name of Mojave&#x27;s contest entry; and Scaled Composites, the manufacturer of the craft.

At least two documentaries were created to document the efforts of the winning team to win the prize. They included Black Sky: The Race for Space and Black Sky: Winning the X Prize. The documentaries chronicle the story of Burt Rutan and SpaceShipOne.

As of 2011, the trophy is on display in the Saint Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri.
== Unsuccessful attempts ==
Although only the Tier One team actually launched a spacecraft on a sub-orbital spaceflight, several other teams have conducted low-altitude tests or announced future plans to launch into space:
* ARCA launched Demonstrator 2B rocket on September 9, 2004, at Cape Midia Air Force Base in Romania. It was the first flight of a reusable monopropellant rocket.
* The da Vinci Project originally announced that their first flight would be on October 2, 2004, but this was postponed indefinitely on September 23, 2004, as they were unable to obtain a few necessary components in time. No flight ever occurred.
* The Canadian Arrow team conducted a successful full-power engine test in 2005 and announced on June 2, 2005, that it had received permission from the Canadian government to use Cape Rich as a future launch site.
* On August 8, 2004, Space Transport Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Rubicon 1&quot; and Armadillo Aerospace&#x27;s unnamed test vehicle, in two separate uncrewed test launches, both crashed and were destroyed.
* On February 15, 2005, AERA Corporation (formerly American Astronautics) announced its plans to send seven paying passengers into space as early as 2006, a full year before the first announced speculative Virgin Galactic flight.

==List of major donors by amount==
*Anousheh Ansari and Amir Ansari, the official sponsors of the competition.
*First USA (J.P. Morgan Chase), US$1,000,000
*New Spirit of St. Louis Organization
*Danforth Foundation, US$500,000
*Tom Clancy, $100K–US$500,000

==Organization==

With the Ansari X Prize, the X Prize Foundation (based in Santa Monica, CA) established a philanthropic model in which offering a prize for achieving a specific goal stimulates entrepreneurial investment that produces a tenfold or greater return on the prize purse and at least one hundredfold in follow-on investment and social benefit. The Foundation has developed into a non-profit prize institute that conceives, designs and manages public competitions for the benefit of humanity.

==Funding==
The funding for the US $10,000,000 prize was unconventional. It came from a &quot;hole-in-one insurance policy&quot;. It was &quot;fully funded through January 1, 2005, through private donations and backed by an insurance policy to guarantee that the $10 million is in place on the day that the prize is won.&quot;

==Spin-offs==
The success of the X Prize competition has spurred spin-offs that are set up in the same way. There have been two major spin-offs at this point, the first of which is the M Prize (short for Methuselah Mouse Prize), which is a prize set up by University of Cambridge biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey which will go to the scientific team that successfully extends the life or reverses the aging of mice, which would then eventually be available to humans. The second is the NASA Centennial Challenges, which consist of (among others) the Tether Challenge in which teams compete to develop superstrong tethers as a component to space elevators, and the Beam Power Challenge which encourages ideas for transmitting power wirelessly. An independent spin-off called the N-Prize was started by Cambridge Microbiologist Paul H. Dear in 2007, designed to foster research into low-cost orbital launchers.

The X Prize foundation itself is developing additional prizes: the Archon X Prize, to advance research in the field of genomics; the Automotive X Prize, an engineering competition to create a fuel efficient clean car; the Wirefly X Prize Cup, an annually held air &amp; space exposition featuring space-related competitions and rocketry, and the Google Lunar X Prize, a competition for privately funded lunar exploration. Of several awards on offer, the largest—$20 million—will be awarded to the first privately funded team to produce a robot that lands on the Moon and travels 500 m (1,640 ft) across its surface.

There is also a possible &quot;H-Prize&quot;, focused on hydrogen vehicle research, although this goal has been addressed by H.R. 5143, an X-Prize-inspired bill passed by the United States House of Representatives, which was later folded into the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

<text>The Canadian Space Agency (CSA; ) is the national space agency of Canada, established in 1990 by the &quot;Canadian Space Agency Act&quot;.

The president is Lisa Campbell, who took the position on September 3, 2020. The agency is responsible to the minister of innovation, science and industry. The CSA&#x27;s headquarters are located at the John H. Chapman Space Centre in Longueuil, Quebec. The agency also has offices in Ottawa, Ontario, and small liaison offices in Houston, Washington, and Paris.

==History==
The origins of the Canadian upper atmosphere and space program can be traced back to the end of the Second World War. Between 1945 and 1960, Canada undertook a number of small launcher and satellite projects under the aegis of defence research, including the development of the Black Brant rocket as well as series of advanced studies examining both orbital rendezvous and re-entry. In 1957, scientists and engineers at the Canadian Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment (DRTE) under the leadership of John H. Chapman embarked on a project initially known simply as S-27 or the Topside Sounder Project. This work would soon lead to the development of Canada&#x27;s first satellite known as Alouette 1.

With the launch of Alouette 1 in September 1962, Canada became the third country to put an artificial satellite into space. At the time, Canada only possessed upper atmospheric launch capabilities (sounding rockets), therefore, Alouette 1 was sent aloft by the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, California. The technical excellence of the satellite, which lasted for ten years instead of the expected one, prompted the further study of the ionosphere with the joint Canadian-designed, U.S.-launched ISIS satellite program. This undertaking was designated an International Milestone of Electrical Engineering by IEEE in 1993. The launch of Anik A-1 in 1972 made Canada the first country in the world to establish its own domestic geostationary communication satellite network.

These and other space-related activities in the 1980s compelled the Canadian government to promulgate the &quot;Canadian Space Agency Act&quot;, which established the Canadian Space Agency. The act received royal assent on May 10, 1990, and came into force on December 14, 1990.

The mandate of the Canadian Space Agency is to promote the peaceful use and development of space, to advance the knowledge of space through science and to ensure that space science and technology provide social and economic benefits for Canadians. The Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s mission statement says that the agency is committed to leading the development and application of space knowledge for the benefit of Canadians and humanity.

In 1999, the CSA was moved from project-based to &quot;A-base&quot; funding and given a fixed annual budget of $300 million. The actual budget varies from year to year due to additional earmarks and special projects. In 2009, Dr. Nicole Buckley was appointed chief scientist of life science.

===Cooperation with the European Space Agency===

The CSA has been a cooperating state of the European Space Agency (ESA) since the 1970s and has several formal and informal partnerships and collaborative programs with space agencies in other countries, such as NASA, ISRO, JAXA, and SNSA.

Canada&#x27;s collaboration with Europe in space activities predated both the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. From 1968, Canada held observer status in the European Space Conference (ESC), a ministerial-level organization set up to determine future European space activities, and it continued in this limited role after ESA was created in 1975. Since January 1, 1979, Canada has had the special status of a &quot;Cooperating State&quot; with the ESA, paying for the privilege and also investing in working time and providing scientific instruments that are placed on ESA probes. Canada is allowed to participate in optional programs; it also has to contribute to the General Budget but not as much as associate membership entail. This status was unique at the time and remains so today.

On 15 December 2010, the accord was renewed for a further 10 years, until 2020. By virtue of this accord, Canada takes part in ESA deliberative bodies and decision-making and in ESA&#x27;s programmes and activities. Canadian firms can bid for and receive contracts to work on programmes. The accord has a provision specifically ensuring a fair industrial return to Canada. The head of the Canadian delegation to ESA is the president of the Canadian Space Agency. As of February 2009, there are currently 30 Canadians that are employed as staff members at ESA. (Distributed over various ESA sites: 20 at ESTEC; 4 at ESOC; 4 at ESA HQ; 2 at ESRIN).

==Canadian space program==

The Canadian space program is administered by the Canadian Space Agency. Canada has contributed technology, expertise and personnel to the world space effort, especially in collaboration with ESA and NASA. In addition to its astronauts and satellites, some of the most notable Canadian technological contributions to space exploration include the Canadarm on the Space Shuttle and Canadarm2 on the International Space Station.

Canada&#x27;s contribution to the International Space Station is the $1.3 billion Mobile Servicing System. This consists of Canadarm2 (SSRMS), Dextre (SPDM), mobile base system (MBS) and multiple robotics workstations that together make up the Mobile Servicing System on the ISS. The Canadarm, Canadarm2 and Dextre all employ the Advanced Space Vision System, which allows more efficient use of the robotic arms. Another Canadian technology of note is the Orbiter Boom Sensor System, which was an extension for the original Canadarm used to inspect the Space Shuttle&#x27;s thermal protection system for damage while in orbit. Before the Space Shuttle&#x27;s retirement, the boom was modified for use with Canadarm2; STS-134 (the Space Shuttle program&#x27;s penultimate mission) left it for use on the ISS.

=== CSA astronauts ===

There have been four recruiting campaigns for astronauts for the CSA. The first, in 1983 by the National Research Council, led to the selection of Roberta Bondar, Marc Garneau, Robert Thirsk, Ken Money, Bjarni Tryggvason and Steve MacLean. The second, in 1992, selected Chris Hadfield, Julie Payette, Dafydd Williams and Michael McKay. On May 13, 2009, it was announced after the completion of a third selection process that two new astronauts, Jeremy Hansen and David Saint-Jacques, had been chosen. The latest recruitment campaign was launched in 2016, attracting 3,772 applicants for 2 candidates. In 2017, Joshua Kutryk and Jennifer Sidey were chosen.

Nine Canadians have participated in 17 crewed missions in total: 14 NASA Space Shuttle missions (including one mission to Mir) and 3 Roscosmos Soyuz missions. Two former Canadian astronauts never flew in space: Michael McKay resigned for medical reasons and Ken Money resigned in 1992, eight years after his selection.

On December 19, 2012, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield launched aboard a Soyuz spacecraft to reach the International Space Station. This mission marked the completion of NASA&#x27;s compensation to Canada for its contribution to the Shuttle and International Space Station programs, meaning that there were no confirmed remaining space flight opportunities for Canadian astronauts. In June 2015, the Canadian government announced a renewed commitment to the International Space Station, securing flights for both of Canada&#x27;s remaining active astronauts. In May 2016, the CSA announced that David Saint-Jacques would fly to the International Space Station aboard a Roscosmos Soyuz rocket in November 2018 for 6 months, as part of the Expedition 58/59 crew. The crew of the Artemis 2 lunar flyby mission will include a CSA astronaut, the first Canadian to travel beyond low Earth orbit, under the terms of a 2020 treaty between the United States and Canada.

===Canadian satellites===

Additionally, there are commercial satellites launched by the telecommunications company Telesat, a former Crown corporation that was privatized in 1998. These are the Anik satellites, the Nimiq satellites (all currently used by Bell Satellite TV), and MSAT-1. Further, technology and research satellites have been developed by UTIAS-SFL, including the CanX program, ExactView-9, and GHGSat-D.

===International projects===
The CSA contributes to many international projects, including satellites, rovers, and space telescopes. The CSA has contributed components to ESA, NASA, ISRO, JAXA, and SNSB projects in the past. Recently, Canada contributed the Fine Guidance Sensor to NASA&#x27;s James Webb Space Telescope.

Additionally, Canadian universities and aerospace contractors, including the University of Calgary, UTIAS-SFL, COM DEV, MDA, Magellan Aerospace, Telesat and others, have provided components to various international space agencies.

==Future programs==

With the successful launching of Radarsat-2 in December 2007 and completion of Canada&#x27;s billion contribution to the International Space Station in early 2008, the CSA found itself with no major follow-on projects. This fact was highlighted by Marc Garneau, Canada&#x27;s first astronaut and former head of the CSA, who in the fall of 2007 called upon the Canadian government to develop and institute a space policy for Canada.

A modest step has been taken to resolve this problem. In November 2008, the Agency signed a $40 million 16-month contract with MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates of Vancouver (now MDA) to begin the design of the RADARSAT Constellation (3 satellite) earth observation mission. In August 2010, further funding was awarded for detailed design work scheduled for completion by 2012. The satellites were launched on June 12, 2019. Also in the 2009 Federal budget, the agency was awarded funding for the preliminary design of robotic Lunar/Martian rovers.

On February 28, 2019, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada&#x27;s commitment to the Lunar Gateway, an international NASA-led project to put a small space station in lunar orbit. The announcement made Canada the first international partner in the Lunar Gateway project. As part of the announcement, Canada has committed to spending $2.05 billion over 24 years to develop the next generation Canadarm 3. This marks Canada&#x27;s largest ever single financial commitment to a single project, surpassing the $1.7 billion spent on projects for the International Space Station.

As part of the Artemis program, CSA is developing a small lunar rover. The robotic rover is being developed in partnership with NASA. It will explore a polar region of the Moon and be capable of surviving a lunar night. The mission will carry at least two science instruments, one from NASA and one from CSA, and will launch by 2026.

===Rockets===

The Canadian Space Agency has no indigenous launch system capability beyond upper atmospheric sounding rockets. Canada relies on other countries, such as the U.S., India and Russia, to launch its spacecraft into orbit, but both the Defence Department and the space agency are looking at the option of constructing a Canadian-made launcher.

The CSA announced in 2011 it was researching locations in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, or the potential reopening of the Churchill Rocket Research Range in Manitoba for a micro satellite (150 kg) launch site to end its reliance on foreign launch providers. Another possible location, CFB Suffield, remains an option. According to Canadian Space Agency officials, it would take 10 to 12 years for a full-scale project to design and build a small satellite launcher. There has been no funding for these activities announced.

Although a new launch facility at Canso, Nova Scotia, is under development (2024–2025 expected completion), its intended use is for commercial launches of the Ukrainian Cyclone-4M rocket starting in 2023. The facility is a project of the Maritime Launch Services company. Any CSA involvement has not been announced.

== Controversy ==
In March 2022, information from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) indicated that CSA had been infiltrated by Chinese agents. The RCMP charged Wanping Zheng, a 61-year-old employed by CSA, in December 2021 with breach of trust, which the police said was tied to foreign interference. Despite repeated security warnings from CSIS since 2015, Zheng continued to work for CSA and was tied to the installation of unauthorized software, including secure file transfer and a messaging applications, on behalf of a foreign company, according to filed court documents. He was also accused of using his status as a CSA engineer to negotiate agreements for a satellite station installation with Iceland, on behalf of a Chinese aerospace company. Zheng resigned from CSA after 26 years with the agency, although none of the allegations against Zheng have been proved in court.

<text>was a city located in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The city itself was founded on January 1, 1951, but the area had already been opened to railway traffic as early as November 20, 1897. As of 2003, the city had an estimated population of 66,058 and the density of 843.87 persons per km2. The total area was 78.28 km2. The city is notable for its Peace Pagoda, built by Nipponzan Myohoji in 1967.

On March 21, 2005, Niitsu was merged into the expanded city of Niigata. Other cities merged into Niigata at this time include the cities of Shirone and Toyosaka, the towns of Kameda, Kosudo and Yokogoshi (all from Nakakanbara District), the town of Nishikawa, and the villages of Ajikata, Iwamuro, Katahigashi, Nakanokuchi and Tsukigata (all from Nishikanbara District).

As of April 1, 2007, the area was part of Akiha-ku ward of Niigata City.

==Geography==
The Akiha hill extends to the south of the city, surrounded by plains. The city is located between the Shinano River on the east side, and the Agano River on the west side. The Niitsu River (Noudai River) flows between these rivers through the middle of the city, until it reaches the Koagano River, a small body of water that connects the Shinano and the Agano rivers. The Small Agano River flows outward from the mouth of the Niitsu, emptying into both the Shinano and Agano Rivers.

The total area of the city was , although some borders of the city are not well defined. Tōkamachi derives its name from the fact that a market was held every tenth day of the month. Similarly, the nearby former town of Muikamachi had its own local market held on days ending in six each month.

==Geography==
Tōkamachi is located in an inland region of southwest Niigata Prefecture. Parts of the city are within the borders of the Jōshin&#x27;etsu-kōgen National Park.

**Minamiuonuma
**Nagaoka
**Ojiya
**Uonuma
**Tsunan

===Climate===
Tōkamachi has a Humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) characterized by warm, wet summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Tōkamachi is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around . Because Tōkamachi lies in a valley, wind patterns bring in clouds from both the Sea of Japan as well as the Pacific Ocean. The mountains surrounding the city (though not terribly high in altitude) act as any other mountains that affect rain and snow patterns providing a barrier for cloud patterns. This causes a great deal of the built up precipitation to drop on the city. The Tōkamachi area receives the most snow of any area on the main island of Honshu.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tōkamachi has declined steadily over the past 50 years.
==History==
The area of present-day Tōkamachi was part of ancient Echigo Province, and was part of the &quot;tenryō&quot; territories held directly by then Tokugawa shogunate. Following the Meiji restoration, was the capital of the newly-formed Nakauonuma District of Niigata Prefecture, and was proclaimed a village on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to town status on September 24, 1897. Tōkamachi gained city status on March 31, 1954, by merging with the neighbouring villages of Nakajō, Kawaji and Rokka. The village of Yoshida (from Nakauonuma District) was annexed on December 1, 1954 followed by the village of Shimojō (from Nakauonuma District) on February 1, 1955. On April 1, 1962 - Tōkamachi absorbed the village of Mizusawa (from Nakauonuma District). The Chūetsu earthquake of October 23, 2004 caused only minor damage to the city. On April 1, 2005 Tōkamachi absorbed the towns of Matsudai and Matsunoyama (both from Higashikubiki District); the town of Kawanishi, and the village of Nakasato (both from Nakauonuma District) to create the new and expanded city of Tōkamachi.

==Government==

Tōkamachi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 24 members. The city contributes two members to the Niigata Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Niigata District No.6 of the lower house of the National Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Sericulture and the production of silk is a traditional mainstay of the local economy. Tōkamachi&#x27;s status as a silk production hub subsequently made it a prominent producer of kimonos, although that has faded in recent years. Agriculture, notably the cultivation of &quot;koshihikari&quot; rice, is also an important local product.

==Education==
Tōkamachi has 18 public elementary schools and nine public middle schools operated by the city government and one private elementary and one private middle school. There are four public high schools operated by the Niigata Prefectural Board of Education. The prefectural also operates three special education schools.

<doc id="328638" wikidata="Q627261" url="?curid=328638" title="Ntare V of Burundi">
<text>Ntare V of Burundi (born Charles Ndizeye; 2 December 1947 – 29 April 1972), less commonly numbered Ntare III, was the last king (&quot;mwami&quot;) of Burundi, reigning from July to November 1966. Until his accession, he was known as Crown Prince Charles Ndizeye.

He seized power in July 1966 by deposing his own father. He reigned until November, when prime minister Michel Micombero overthrew him, ending the Burundian monarchy. He went into exile but returned in 1972, only to be swiftly arrested by the republican government. Later that year, during a period of mass violence called the &quot;Ikiza&quot;, he was killed under unclear circumstances. 

==Early life==
Charles Ndizeye was the son of King Mwambutsa IV (1912–1977) and Queen Baramparaye Ruhasha (1929–2007). He had one half-brother (Prince Louis Rwagasore, assassinated 1961 whilst prime minister), and two half-sisters: Princess Rosa Paula Iribagiza (born 1934) and Princess Regina Kanyange (died 1987). Ndizeye was educated at Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland.

==Ascension and rule==
After a Hutu-led coup attempt in October 1965, Mwambutsa IV went into exile in Switzerland, while Prime Minister Léopold Biha was hospitalized. Though the monarch attempted to rule from abroad, this effectively left Burundi without a state head. The country was also heavily affected by the coup&#x27;s aftermath, as Tutsi officers under Michel Micombero purged the security forces and political leadership of Hutu figures. In March 1966, Mwambusta IV designated Charles Ndizeye, his only surviving son, as heir apparent and entrusted him with overseeing Burundi&#x27;s government. The Crown Prince then formally deposed his father and his father&#x27;s government in July 1966. On 8 July, Ndizeye declared the dismissal of Prime Minister Biha and the suspension of the constitution. The following day he asked Micombero to form a government. On 12 July Micombero presented his government to the prince with himself as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Ndizeye was formally crowned as &quot;mwami&quot; on 3 September, taking the regnal name Ntare V.

The cooperation between Ntare V and Micombero was short-lived. Tensions between the soldiers in the government and the monarchy emerged in August and led to a reshuffling of the cabinet in September. On 7 November Ntare V attempted to broadcast a decree dismissing Micombero&#x27;s government, but was turned away from the radio station by soldiers. Three weeks later, Ntare V was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on a state visit, celebrating the takeover of Mobutu Sese Seko. On 28 November, the king heard over radio that Micombero had led a military coup d&#x27;état, abolishing the monarchy and proclaiming Burundi a republic with himself as its first President. Overall, Ntare V had the shortest rule of any Burundian &quot;mwami&quot;.

Ntare V went into exile in West Germany and later Uganda. Meanwhile, Micombero&#x27;s regime had to contend with various forms of resistance and conducted a series of purges. As time went on, the government&#x27;s support base became increasingly narrow, and it marginalized not just Hutu but also certain Tutsi sub-groups like the Banyaruguru. In 1971, a group of Tutsi figures were arrested over an alleged plot to restore the monarchy.

==Execution==

Ntare V returned to Burundi in March 1972. Ugandan President Idi Amin claimed he received a written guarantee from President Micombero that Ntare could return to Burundi and live there as a private citizen. Using the helicopter at his disposal from Amin, Ntare arrived. Within a few hours he was put under house arrest in the former palace in Gitega. Soon after, an official radio broadcast proclaimed that Ntare was trying to instigate a mercenary invasion of Burundi to take back rule. Whether the former monarch had really intended to peacefully return or actually plotted a takeover, as Micombero&#x27;s government alleged, remains unclear. Some ministers favored keeping him under restricted protection in Gitega, while others wanted him dead. As the government discussed its next moves, Ntare remained under house arrest in Gitega.

On 29 April, Hutu rebels began an uprising against the Burundian government. Around the same time, Micombero dismissed his entire cabinet. At the evening of the same day, Ntare was assassinated by Burundian soldiers under circumstances which remain unclear. Whether there was a conspiracy or his death involved a spontaneous outbreak of violence in Gitega has not been determined. Researcher Nigel Watt argued that Ntare&#x27;s murder was motivated by the Burundian government&#x27;s fear that monarchists might support the Hutu rebellion; by the time of his death, the former &quot;mwami&quot; was seen as a champion of the interests of both Hutu as well as Tutsi-Banyaruguru marginalized by Micombero. Radio Nationale du Burundi (RNB Broadcasting) announced that the king was shot while attempting to escape from the palace where he had been &quot;under arrest&quot;. The king&#x27;s supporters claim he was taken from the Royal Palace and executed by a firing squad before being thrown into a common grave. The king was 24 years old. Meanwhile, the Hutu uprising was quelled by Micombero&#x27;s forces. Between 80,000 and 210,000 people died in the ensuing mass killings.

<doc id="328641" wikidata="Q711610" url="?curid=328641" title="Shirone, Niigata">
<text>was a city located in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The city was founded on June 1, 1959.

== Population ==
As of 2003, the city had an estimated population of 39,966 and density of . The total area was .

== History ==
On March 21, 2005, Shirone, along with the cities of Niitsu and Toyosaka, the towns of Kameda, Kosudo and Yokogoshi (all from Nakakanbara District), the town of Nishikawa, and the villages of Ajikata, Iwamuro, Katahigashi, Nakanokuchi and Tsukigata (all from Nishikanbara District), was merged into the expanded city of Niigata. As of April 1, 2007, the area is now part of Minami-ku ward.

==Festivals==

=== Kite festival ===
In June every year, Shirone hosts the week-long Giant Kite Festival (takomatsuri). Opposing teams formed by residents battle across the Nakanoguchi River using giants kites. 

The kites are hand made and painted by the team members for the duration of the preceding year. Each kite measures about and typically sports a portrait of a samurai, local figure, or mascot signifying the area or team sponsor. Each team lines their side of the river and runs the kite into flight. 

Once airborne, the kites are carried by the wind and the hand-made lines are invariably tangled. This is due to the prevailing wind direction in June and the particular course of the river. The teams then engage in a tug of war until the ropes break—the winning team being the team that pulls over more of the opponent&#x27;s rope.

<doc id="328642" wikidata="Q282359" url="?curid=328642" title="Michel Micombero">
<text>Michel Micombero (26 August 194016 July 1983) was a Burundian military officer and politician who ruled the country as &quot;de facto&quot; military dictator for the decade between 1966 and 1976. He was the last Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Burundi from July to November 1966, and the first President of the country from November 1966 until his overthrow in 1976.

Micombero was an ethnic Tutsi who began his career as an officer in the Burundian military at the time of Burundi&#x27;s independence in 1962. He studied abroad and was given a ministerial portfolio on his return. He rose to prominence for his role in helping to crush an attempted coup d&#x27;état in October 1965 by ethnic Hutu soldiers against the Tutsi-dominated monarchy. In its aftermath, in 1966, Micombero himself instigated two further coups against the monarchy which he perceived as too moderate. The first coup in July installed a new king on the throne, propelling Micombero to the role of prime minister. The second coup in November abolished the monarchy itself, bringing Micombero to power as the first president of the new Republic of Burundi.

Micombero led a one-party state which centralised the country&#x27;s institutions and adopted a neutral stance in the Cold War. Dissent was repressed and, in 1972, an attempt to challenge Micombero&#x27;s power led to genocidal violence against the Hutu population in which around 100,000 people, mainly Hutus, were killed. His regime finally collapsed in 1976 when he was ousted in a coup d&#x27;état by another army officer, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, who installed himself as president. Micombero went into exile in Somalia, where he died in 1983.

== Biography ==
=== Early life, 1940–1962 ===
Micombero was born in Rutovu, Bururi Province in Belgian-ruled Ruanda-Urundi on 26 August 1940. His parents were peasants of Hima ethnicity, part of the wider Tutsi ethnic group. Micombero studied at Catholic mission schools in Burundi and, in 1960, joined the military which was being formed ahead of Burundi&#x27;s planned independence in 1962. As part of his training, he was sent to study at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels, Belgium in April 1960 to train as an officer. In March 1962 he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant. At the time of the independence of the Kingdom of Burundi in July 1962, he held the rank of captain. In November he was made assistant commander-in-chief of the Burundian National Army (&quot;Armée Nationale Burundaise&quot;).

===Independence and seizure of power, 1962–1966===

In early post-independence Burundi, the Tutsi-dominated monarchy of Mwambutsa IV attempted to balance the interests of Tutsi with those of the Hutu majority. In 1963, Micombero joined the ruling Union for National Progress (, UPRONA) party which, though dominated by Tutsi, also tried to attract Hutu members. In June, Micombero was named State Secretary for Defense (Minister of National Defence), making him head of the military at the age of 23. In September he appealed to the National Assembly to merge the civilian National Gendarmerie (&quot;Gendarmerie nationale&quot;) into the army to head off &quot;antagonistic&quot; tendencies between the two forces, but this was never carried out.

In October 1965, a group of ethnic Hutus, drawn largely from the National Gendarmerie, attempted to overthrow the Burundian monarchy. Their attempt was unsuccessful but Mwambutsa IV fled into exile. Micombero led the repression against the coup&#x27;s perpetrators. On 9 November 1965 he married Adèle Nzeyimana, a Ganwa daughter of a subchief. In July 1966, a second coup d&#x27;état brought the king&#x27;s son, Ntare V, to power. On 8 July Ntare declared the dismissal of Prime Minister Léopold Biha and the suspension of the constitution. The following day he asked Micombero to form a government. On 12 July Micombero presented his government to Ntare with himself as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Tensions between the soldiers in the government and the monarchy emerged in August and led to a reshuffling of the cabinet in September. On 7 November Ntare attempted to broadcast a decree dismissing Micombero&#x27;s government, but was turned away from the radio station by soldiers. Three weeks later, on 28 November, while Ntare was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on a state visit, Micombero, now a colonel, led a military coup d&#x27;état that deposed the king. He then abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Burundi a republic with himself as its first President.

=== Dictatorship, 1966–1976 ===

As president, Micombero declared Burundi a one-party state with UPRONA as the only legal party. He abolished the parliament and instead set up a &quot;National Revolutionary Council&quot;. His ideology of &quot;democratic centralism&quot; brought all the country&#x27;s institutions and media under the control of what was effectively a military dictatorship. His regime combined ideas from the socialist ideology of Tanzania with other doctrines from Joseph-Désiré Mobutu&#x27;s regime in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (known as Zaire from 1971 to 1997). Micombero&#x27;s regime systematically marginalized Hutus; for instance, he excluded Hutus from the national military by introducing new height and girth standards that were usually only fulfilled by Tutsi recruits.

Micombero became increasingly paranoid after suffering an injury in a road accident in 1967. He was widely believed to be an alcoholic, and often seen in a &quot;drunken stupor&quot;. Various plots against the regime were discovered and unrest remained; notable attempts at deposing him were prevented in 1969 and 1971. His base of support became increasingly restricted to Tutsi in the northern and central regions of Burundi. For instance, Tutsis from Muramvya led the 1971 plot against his rule. As a Cold War leader, he was able to play off both Communist and Western powers against one another. In 1969, he accused Belgium of having supported a minor Hutu revolt, causing the latter to withdraw military aid. The Belgians were quickly replaced by the French.

In April 1972, a rebellion broke out among the Hutu at Rumonge in the south at the encouragement of the Tanzanian regime and spread rapidly. In subsequent ethnic violence, as many as 1,000 Tutsi were killed. The response of the Micombero regime was to launch a campaign of genocidal violence against the Hutu in the region in which at least 100,000 people are thought to have been killed. The deposed king Ntare, said to have led the rebellion, was himself murdered. The massacres particularly targeted educated Hutus. A number of Banyaruguru Tutsis were also murdered. Realizing that the violence was out of control, Micombero eventually ordered the massacres to cease. In 1973, after further violence, Mobutu was forced to intervene to prevent a Tanzanian invasion. Following the end of the crisis, Micombero introduced a new constitution allowing him to run for a further seven-year term. He also laid the foundation for the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries the same year, along with the governments of Rwanda and Zaire.

In November 1976 opponents, led by Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, led a successful coup d&#x27;état against Micombero&#x27;s regime. Micombero himself was arrested and a second republic was declared under the dictatorship of Bagaza. Although a Tutsi and a participant in the killings of 1972, Bagaza made concessions to the Hutu majority and made some progress towards modernising the Burundian state until he too was deposed in 1987.

=== Exile and death, 1977–1983 ===
Micombero was exiled from Burundi in 1977. He took up residence in Somalia, then ruled by dictator Siad Barre who was a close friend. He gained a degree in economics from the Somali National University in 1982. He died of a heart attack at Madina Hospital in Mogadishu in 1983.

Researcher Nigel Watt assessed Micombero as the &quot;first, and worst, of the three Tutsi military presidents&quot; of Burundi, as, by unleashing the 1972 violence, he caused lasting hatred and violence that plagued Burundi for decades.

<text>John Christopher McGinley (born August 3, 1959) is an American actor. His best known roles include Perry Cox in &quot;Scrubs&quot;, Bob Slydell in &quot;Office Space&quot;, Captain Hendrix in &quot;The Rock&quot;, Sergeant Red O&#x27;Neill in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon,&quot; Marv in Stone&#x27;s &quot;Wall Street&quot;, FBI agent Ben Harp in &quot;Point Break&quot;, and the serial killer Edgler Foreman Vess in the TV miniseries of &quot;Intensity&quot;, based on the novel by Dean Koontz.

==Early life==
McGinley, who is one of five children, was born in the Greenwich Village section of New York City, the son of a schoolteacher and a stockbroker. His paternal great-grandfather was from Donegal, Ireland. McGinley was raised in Millburn, New Jersey, and attended Millburn High School, where he played wide receiver for the school&#x27;s football team. He studied acting at Syracuse University, and later at New York University&#x27;s Graduate Acting Program at the Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in 1984. Upon completing his education, McGinley did a variety of different work, including off-Broadway and Broadway productions, and a two-year stint on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;.

==Career==
McGinley has had a prolific career, primarily as a supporting character actor. He was noticed by a casting scout while working as John Turturro&#x27;s understudy in John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s 1984 production of &quot;Danny and the Deep Blue Sea&quot;, which led to a successful audition for the role of Sergeant Red O&#x27;Neill in the Oscar-winning &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986). McGinley had been cast in his first film role in Alan Alda&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot; earlier in 1986. That was followed the next year with &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), and again the next with &quot;Talk Radio&quot; (1988). He was featured in a 1980s Subaru commercial. He appeared in the &quot;Celebrity Challenge&quot; version of &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, losing to Dean Cain. McGinley wrote the script for, and co-starred in, the 1990 film &quot;Suffering Bastards&quot;.

He worked continually throughout the 1990s, appearing in films such as &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot; (1991), &quot;Article 99&quot; (1992), &quot;Wagons East&quot; (1994), &quot;Seven&quot; (1995), &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996), &quot;Set It Off&quot; (1996), &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; (1997) and &quot;Office Space&quot; (1999) (McGinley improvised several takes about his character&#x27;s fondness for Michael Bolton). In 2007, he had a role as Chuck in the film &quot;Are We Done Yet?&quot; He had a small role as a gay highway patrolman in the film &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; which co-stars his &quot;Article 99&quot; co-star Ray Liotta, although they don&#x27;t share any screen credit.

McGinley has done voice-over work on animated television series, including the superhero The Atom on several episodes of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, a guest appearance as &quot;The White Shadow&quot;, the secret government agent overseeing Huey Freeman on &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, voicing The Whammer on the PBS Kids Go! series &quot;WordGirl&quot; as well as the lead character in the Sony PSP video game &quot;Dead Head Fred&quot;.

McGinley received critical acclaim for his performance as a serial killer in Dean Koontz&#x27;s suspense drama &quot;Intensity&quot; (1997). It became Fox Television&#x27;s highest-rated miniseries. He worked with Koontz and Fox once more in &quot;Sole Survivor&quot; (2000).

In 2001, McGinley began work as a regular on the NBC television series &quot;Scrubs&quot; as the acerbic Dr. Perry Cox. Throughout the series Dr. Cox acts as an unwilling mentor to the protagonist J.D. (Zach Braff). McGinley has said that there are three things over the course of the series that he improvises: his constant usage of girls&#x27; names for JD, which he does with all his real friends; his whistle, which he describes as &quot;a bad habit&quot;; and his habit of touching his nose, a tribute to Robert Redford&#x27;s character in &quot;The Sting&quot;, and which he says means &quot;It&#x27;s gonna be OK.&quot;

Since the NFL season of 2007, McGinley has played the &quot;Commish&quot; of the More Taste League commercials for Miller Lite. He has done commercials for the Champions Tour, a professional golf tour for men over the age of 50. In 2008, McGinley was the narrator of the documentary of the 2008 Stanley Cup Championship of the Detroit Red Wings. In 2009, McGinley started narrating commercials for ESPN.com.

McGinley wrote a 2005 book titled &quot;Untalkative Bunny: How to be Heard Without Saying a Word&quot;, which featured the title character from the show &quot;Untalkative Bunny&quot; on its cover.

In 2008, McGinley was named an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society, Trinity College, Dublin.

In 2009, he was cast in the film adaptation of the comic book &quot;Superman/Batman: Public Enemies&quot;, voicing Metallo.

In 2012, it was announced that McGinley would be a recurring character on USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Burn Notice&quot; as Michael Westen&#x27;s original CIA trainer, Tom Card. He was first introduced in the second episode of the show&#x27;s sixth season. In the same year, he appeared in a State Farm insurance commercial as a father wanting his college graduate son to move out.

He began 2013 in the Broadway revival of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; as Dave Moss. &quot;It was the best couple of months of my life,&quot; he said. In the same year, it was announced that TBS made a series order for the television series &quot;Ground Floor&quot;, which stars McGinley. The series was canceled in 2015 after two seasons. In October 2014, McGinley hosted The E Street Radio channel on Sirius XM20 radio, discussing his appreciation of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s music, and their shared New Jersey roots.

From 2016 to 2018, he starred in the horror comedy television series, Stan Against Evil on IFC. McGinley played a crusty retired sheriff who reluctantly helps his perky replacement fight the demons that have taken over their small town.

==Personal life==
In February 1997, McGinley married Lauren Lambert. Their son, Max, who has Down syndrome, was born that year. In December 2001, Lambert and McGinley divorced. In October 2002, he was chosen as &quot;Dad of the Month&quot; at now-defunct iParenting.com. In August 2006, McGinley became engaged to yoga instructor Nichole Kessler in Malibu, whom he had dated for two years. The couple married on April 7, 2007, in a private ceremony at their home. They have two daughters.

McGinley owns a stake in one of Billy Gilroy&#x27;s New York SoHo bistros, along with fellow actor Willem Dafoe.

McGinley serves on the board of the Global Down Syndrome Foundation, based in Denver. He is a celebrity Ambassador for the National Down Syndrome Society. In addition, he is a Global Ambassador for Special Olympics and was an integral part in crafting its &quot;R-word: Spread The Word, To End The Word&quot; campaign. McGinley is a vocal supporter for the disabled community, and commented in late 2011 on the experience of raising a teenager with Down syndrome along with two young daughters:

McGinley is an avid fan of the NHL Detroit Red Wings, and shows this by wearing a Red Wings jersey (usually Chris Chelios) in several &quot;Scrubs&quot; episodes. He was the narrator of the 2008 Championship DVD of the Red Wings. He maintains a home in Malibu, California, and is well known as a member of the &quot;Malibu Mob&quot;, a group of celebrity friends and neighbors including John Cusack, Tony Danza, former Detroit Red Wings defenseman Chris Chelios, big-wave surfer Laird Hamilton, beach volleyball pro Gabrielle Reece, and tennis player John McEnroe. McGinley enjoys going golfing with John Cusack in his free time, and is a member of the Sherwood Lake Club.

During the 9/11 attacks, on September 11th 2001, McGinley&#x27;s brother, Mark McGinley, was working on the 62nd floor of the South Tower. John said his brother Mark felt his desk shake after the North Tower was hit, which prompted him to get up and exit the building. Mark made his way downstairs about 20 floors, before his Tower was then hit. Mark received a concussion while going down the stairs after the South Tower was hit and due to the effects of the concussion, Mark was so disoriented that he walked up FDR Drive (all the way to East Harlem). John stated his brother was missing for approximately 12 hours after the Towers were hit, and he is thankful his brother made it out alive.

==History==

The area of present-day Uotsu was part of ancient Etchū Province and has been inhabited since at least the Jōmon period. Discovery of gold in the mountains of Uozu around 1394 led to an influx of people, making the area around Matsukura Castle a center for the region. Later, when Matsukura Castle was destroyed, the center was reestablished around Uozu Castle close to the sea. In 1582, the Siege of Uozu occurred between forces allied to the Uesugi clan, and forces under Oda Nobunaga. Uozu Castle was captured by Oda forces only three days before Oda&#x27;s assassination at the Honnō-ji incident.

Under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, Uozu was part of Kaga Domain ruled by the Maeda clan. The modern town of Uozu was established with the establishment of the municipalities system on 1 April 1889. The Taisho rice riots of 1918 began at Uozu before spreading across the country. Most of the western portion of the town was destroyed in a fire in 1943, but the town escaped damage in World War II. Uozu was raised to city status on 1 April 1952. In September 1956, a great fire ravished many buildings in Uozu.

===Uozu&#x27;s Three Mysteries===

====The Buried Forest====
Approximately 2000 years ago, a primeval sugi (Cryptomeria) forest along the coast was partially buried so that only the trunks were preserved. The area is a National Natural Monument, and there is a museum in Uotsu where examples can be seen.

==== Firefly Squid====
In the early morning hours, from the end of March to the beginning of June, female rise to the surface to spawn. Their name comes from a bluish white glow which emanates from various points on their bodies.

==== Mirages====
The waters of Toyama Bay are noted for mirages, especially during spring and winter. The spring mirage for which Uozu is famous for may be seen on warm, sunny, windless days from April to June. The Mirage Land Amusement Park (ミラージュランド) with its large Ferris wheel is a popular location for observation of the phenomena.

===Other ===
Other sightseeing destinations in Uozu include the Uozu Aquarium, Kintaro Hot Springs (金太郎温泉), Ariso Dome Gymnasium, Niikawa Culture Hall, the Uozu Historical Folk Museum, Lake Ikejiri, Hirazawa Waterfalls and site of Matsukura Castle.

It was raised to city status on March 31, 1954 after merging with the neighbouring villages of Oya, Kawarada, Konosu, Nishiho, Mii, and Najimi. On February 1, 2006, the town of Monzen was merged into Wajima.

Shiroyone Senmaida Rice Terraces &quot;1000 Rice Fields&quot; ()) is one of the most scenic places in Ishikawa. There are actually 1004 fields which are either owned and tended by families, or rented out and looked after by the locals. Each year during the last week of September, the names of two couples are drawn as part of a nationwide lottery to have their wedding ceremony at Senmaida. The event is open to the public.

As a memorial to the Noto earthquake, a tradition of lighting the fields began. Initially this was done with millions of candles placed around each field following the harvest. Due to the popularity of the spectacle, solar LED lanterns are now used allowing the fields to be lit nightly. The lanterns are installed at the end of September and are left up through March when work on the fields begins again. The fields remain lit for about four hours after sunset.

Once a year the people of Noto guide the male from his forest home through the city, while stopping at every business, home, and shrine to give blessings to the people of Wajima, and eventually to meet his wife at the sea. To guide him they carry bright lights (the ) and beat (drums).

The main event takes place on the third night of the festival at midnight at Wajima Marine Park.

=== Gojinjo-daiko ===

Playing &quot;gojinjo-daiko&quot; is strictly restricted to residents in Nafune, a small village within Wajima, where only 250 people live. It is very rare to see a live drum performance.

The &quot;gojinjo-daiko&quot; began in 1577 when the famous general, Uesugi Kenshin invaded Noto. Because local people had no weapons, they resisted by beating war drums and wore ferocious looking devil masks with seaweed on their heads to scare off their enemies. The low sound of drums sound associated with the rumbling of the earth frightened off the invaders.

<text>is a city located in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 13,531 in 6013 households, and a population density of 54.6 persons per km2. The total area of the city was .

== Etymology==
Suzu is thought to have been named after Suzu Shrine, an ancient Shinto shrine located in the Awazu area of the city. The name &quot;Suzu&quot; appears in Nara period records; however, the &quot;kanji&quot; for Suzu (珠洲) is not thought to have been in use until the early Wadō era (713 AD). There is also the theory that the name originates from the Ainu language, as with several other place names in the Noto area.

==Geography==
Suzu occupies the northeastern tip of the Noto Peninsula and is bordered by the Sea of Japan on three sides. Parts of the city are within the borders of the Noto Hantō Quasi-National Park.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
*Ishikawa Prefecture
**Noto
**Wajima

===Climate===
Suzu has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Suzu is 13.0 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2234 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.4 °C.


==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Suzu has declined steadily over the past 50 years.
== History ==

In ancient times, Suzu prospered as a gateway for trade by sea, establishing connections with places such as Izumo, Sado and Ezo. In turn, Suzu was introduced to ironware culture from a considerably early period in the Izumo era, and even gained crucial agricultural influence and knowledge to develop an agricultural society. In fact, it is thought that such ancient Noto culture originated and spread outwards from the tip of the Noto Peninsula.

In the second year of the Yōrō (718), Noto Province consisting of the 4 districts of Suzu, Fugeshi, Hakui and Noto was established. For a short period of time, the land was claimed as part of Etchū Province. During this period the famous Ōtomo no Yakamochi recited a poem about the picturesque scenery of Suzu Bay, which would later be included in the famous poetry anthology &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;.
Later in the Kōji period (1143), Noto Provincial Governor Minamoto no Toshikane established Wakayama &quot;shōen&quot; which grew to become the largest estate in Noto, expanding territory to take over the majority of land in Suzu. Around this time, production of Suzu ware began, which was exported as far as Hokkaido. The area was also noted from ancient times for the production of salt.

During the Sengoku period (1467–1568), the area was contested between the Hatakeyama clan, Uesugi clan and Maeda clan, with the area becoming part of Kaga Domain under the Edo-period Tokugawa shogunate. Following the Meiji Restoration, the area was organised into one town (Iida) and 14 villages in 1889. These municipalities merged on 15 July 1954 to form the city of Suzu.

Since 2020, the city has been hit by an earthquake swarm. A 5.4 earthquake in June 2022 injured seven people, damaged a temple and shattered windows. In May 2023, a 6.5 earthquake hit the city. One person died, 47 others were injured, 38 houses collapsed, 263 were partially destroyed and 1,825 others were damaged in Suzu, over one-third of the city&#x27;s housing stock. At the beginning of 2024, another earthquake, measuring 7.6, hit close to Suzu, causing 146 deaths in the city (including 49 indirectly) and destroying or severely damaging 5,916 of the city&#x27;s 6,000 houses.

==Government==
Suzu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 14 members.

== Economy ==
=== Industries ===

*Agriculture: wet-land rice, Matsutake mushrooms, charcoal, and other crops
*Ceramics: portable stoves called &quot;shichirin&quot; and Suzu ware are the chief ceramic goods produced in the city. Also, diatomaceous earth is found almost anywhere within the city limits, and it has been used for ceramics since the Edo period.
*Commercial fishing: processing of marine goods
*Livestock: Noto Beef, a regionally renowned brand
*&quot;Sake&quot;: there are several sake producers in the area, including the Sougen Sake Brewery.
*Salt: salt is still manufactured traditionally with evaporation ponds, particularly through the Agehama method of artificially flooded saltpans.

More recently, Suzu has become known for its production of sawtooth oak charcoal (クヌギ炭, &quot;kunugi-zumi&quot;) for use in the Japanese tea ceremony.

==Education==
Suzu has seven public elementary schools and four middle schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Ishikawa Prefectural Board of Education. The prefectural also operates one special education school.

==Transportation==
Noto Railway&#x27;s Noto Line ran from Anamizu Station to Suzu&#x27;s Takojima Station until April 2005, when the line was permanently closed. Today, the city does not have any passenger railway service.

A 14 meter tall &quot;kiriko&quot; is carried by a group of young people on their shoulders around the Ukai area in Houryuu-machi. Although the &quot;kiriko&quot; in Jike, Misaki-machi, is recognized as being the biggest in Japan, the &quot;kiriko&quot; used in this festival is the largest among &quot;kiriko&quot; that are carried on the shoulders. In the final stages of the festival, with fireworks in the background, the &quot;kiriko&quot; is pushed towards the sea and the participants do boisterous dance in the sea around pine torches.

The name of &quot;Hakui&quot; is derived from the &quot;kanji&quot; 羽 (ha), meaning feathers, and 咋 (kui) meaning &quot;to eat&quot;.

The total area of the city was . Obama gained publicity in the United States and elsewhere in 2008, as it shares its name with Barack Obama, who ran for, and later became the 44th President of the United States.

==Etymology==
Obama means &quot;small beach&quot; in Japanese.

==Geography==
Obama is located in far southwestern Fukui Prefecture, bordered by Shiga Prefecture to the south and the heavily indented ria coast of Obama Bay (within Wakasa Bay) on the Sea of Japan to the north. It is due north of Kyoto, and is about four to seven hours by train from Tokyo. Parts of the city are within the borders of the Wakasa Wan Quasi-National Park.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
*Fukui Prefecture
**Ōi
**Wakasa
*Shiga Prefecture
**Takashima

===Climate===

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Obama has been on gradual decline since its peak population of ~38500 in late 1960s and early 1970s.

==History==
Obama developed as a seaport with connections to the Asian continent even before the start of written history in Japan, and artefacts from China have been found in local tombs from the Kofun period. From the Asuka period and Nara period, salt and seafood from the Obama area were supplied to the imperial dynasty, and under the Ritsuryō system, Obama was the capital of Wakasa Province. Many temples and cultural remains from the Nara and Heian period are found in the Obama area, and the city labels itself &quot;Nara by the sea&quot; in its tourist promotions. As a result of its location in the Wakasa Province area, which travelers passed through when traveling between China and Kyoto, the area was influenced by Chinese culture for a long period. There are many buildings and houses in the Sancho-machi area of the city whose design was influenced by trade with the Chinese mainland.

In the Edo period, Obama was the jōkamachi of the Obama Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate and was ruled by a branch of the influential Sakai clan. The town remained an important port for the &quot;kitamaebune&quot; coastal trade, and was the starting point of the Saba-kaidō (&quot;Mackerel highway&quot;) connecting the Sea of Japan to Kyoto.

With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the town of Obama was created. It was raised to city status on March 30, 1951, after merging with surrounding municipalities.

Obama is one of the locations where Japanese citizens were abducted by North Korean agents on July 7, 1978.

==Government==
Obama has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members.

==Economy==
The economy of Obama is mixed, with agriculture and commercial fishing playing important roles. Seasonal tourism is of growing importance. Wakasa lacquered chopsticks, agate accessories, and other crafts are made in the area.

==Education==
Obama has 17 public elementary schools and two middle schools operated by the city government, and three public high schools operated by the Fukui Prefectural Board of Education. The prefectural also operates one special education school.

===Relationship with Barack Obama===
The city of Obama has received much publicity because it shares its name with former U.S. President Barack Obama. It began when Obama as a Senator gave a 2006 interview to Japanese television network TBS where he noted that, when passing through customs in Narita Airport, the official who inspected his visa said that he was from Obama. The Obama City Hall heard about the interview and the mayor, Toshio Murakami, sent Senator Obama a set of the city&#x27;s famous lacquer chopsticks, a DVD about the city and a letter wishing him the best. As Senator Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign progressed, more local businesses began to organize primary parties and put up &quot;Go Obama!&quot; posters, sell &quot;I love Obama&quot; T-shirts, and produce manjū (a type of Japanese confectionery) with Senator Obama&#x27;s face on them. A hula group began in the town in honor of Senator Obama&#x27;s home state of Hawaii. The troupe visited Honolulu in June to perform at the Pan Pacific Festival.

Obama has since thanked the town for their gifts and support, saying: &quot;I look forward to a future marked by the continued friendship of our two great nations and a shared commitment to a better, freer world&quot;.

There are a number of Japanese people with the surname Obama. Though the former American President is of Kenyan Luo heritage, it is not uncommon for Japanese and East African names to sound alike.

As a result of the victory by Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, the Mayor of Obama City announced to the Japanese press that he intended to commission a statue of Barack Obama to be put in front of the city hall &quot;as a token of the great historical moment for the name Obama&quot;. On January 20, 2009, the day that Barack Obama was sworn into office, the city of Obama celebrated the inauguration with women dancing the hula at the Hagaji Temple.

On November 14, 2009, President Obama specifically acknowledged his connection with Obama by mentioning it and its citizens in a speech at Suntory Hall in Tokyo.

In 2013, Obama mayor Koji Matsuzaki gave a red lacquer pen to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to give to President Obama.

<text>is the capital city of Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 187,985 in 90,924 households, and a population density of 880 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Overview==
===Toponymy===
Kōfu&#x27;s name means &quot;capital of Kai Province&quot;. During the Sengoku period, it was famous as the stronghold of Takeda Shingen.

===Cityscapes===
==Geography==
Kōfu is located in north-central Yamanashi Prefecture which is in Central Honshu. It extends from the northern border of the prefecture with Nagano Prefecture to the south until it almost reaches the prefecture&#x27;s southern border. It is narrow along its east–west axis. The city bisects the Kōfu Basin and is 250 to 300 meters above sea level. Kōfu is surrounded by mountains on all sides. Three quarters of Kōfu&#x27;s territory is a part of Mount Kinpu in the north. Much of the northern portion of the city is within the Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park. Mount Fuji is visible in the distance from Kōfu to the south.

===Climate===
Kōfu has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), though it is less wet than either the south or Sea of Japan coast due to its location in a shielded mountain valley. Temperature ranges are noticeably greater than in coastal regions: in 2004 Kōfu reached a temperature of previously almost unknown in Japan, and it has fallen below as early as 26 October, which is about a month before the earliest freezing temperatures in such coastal cities as Kanazawa or Tokyo.

; Yamanashi Prefecture
*Chūō
*Fuefuki
*Fujikawaguchiko
*Hokuto
*Ichikawamisato
*Kai
*Minobu
*Shōwa
*Yamanashi

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kōfu has remained relatively stable over the past 50 years.
==History==
===Prehistoric ages===
Archaeologists have discovered evidence of human settlement in the Kōfu area dating to the Japanese Paleolithic period, with continuous settlement through the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods.
===Ancient ages===
During the Nara period, the provincial temple of Kai Province was established in what is now Kōfu, indicating that the Nara period provincial capital was located nearby, as the name of the city implies.

During the Heian period, a branch of the Minamoto clan, the &quot;Kai-Genji&quot; ruled over vast &quot;shōen&quot; estates, and developed a military force noted for its use of cavalry.

===Feudal period===
By the Muromachi period, a branch of the Kai-Genji, the Takeda clan came to dominate the area, and built a castle in what is now part of Kōfu.

Under the rule of Takeda Nobutora, Kōfu was rebuilt as a castle town starting in 1519, and remained the capital of the Takeda clan under Takeda Shingen and his son Takeda Katsuyori. 
===Early modern ages===
During the Edo period, Kai Province was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory ruled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, and Kōfu Castle remained its administrative center. In 1705, in a signal honour, it was conferred on Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu a favourite of the fifth shōgun. He was a member of the Yanagisawa clan descendants of the &quot;Kai-Genji&quot;, the branch of the Minamoto clan which had been enfeoffed with the province of Kai in the eleventh century. His son, Yoshiyasu was transferred to Yamato-Koriyama Castle in 1724 after which Kofu Castle was again held directly by the Shogunate.
===Late modern ages===
Following the Meiji restoration, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system, the town of Kōfu was proclaimed on July 1, 1889.

The city experienced a major flood disaster in 1907 (明治40年の大水害) caused by heavy rain in a typhoon from the night of August 21, 1907 and by deforestation which was accelerated in Yamanashi Prefecture, due to the need for wood for fuel of the steam engines of the growing industrial policy of the Fujimura Prefectural Government.
A police officer inspected the stricken area from August 23 to October 10, 1907.
Patrol diaries of Masaki Tsukasa Kasaburo said &quot;This heavy rainfall causes rivers to run down, landslides and levee failures, bridge piers destruction, etc., resulting in the destruction of homes and villages, village isolation, runoff, and traffic disruptions caused serious damage 233 people died, 5757 houses were run out, 650 hectares of lands have been buried or run down, 3353 landslides, collapse and damage distance of about 140 kilometers of levees, runoff and burial of roads, the damage distance was about 500 kilometers, 393 telephone poles collapsed. It was the largest natural disaster in modern times in Yamanashi Prefecture.

During World War II, much of the city was destroyed by United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bombers during a major air raid during the night of 6 July 1945.
===Contemporary ages===
Kōfu was designated as one of the special cities of Japan on April 1, 2000.
On March 1, 2006, Kōfu, with a population of 193,795, absorbed the town of Nakamichi (from Higashiyatsushiro District), and the northern part of the village of Kamikuishiki (from Nishiyatsushiro District) increasing the population to 201,184.

On April 1, 2019, Kōfu&#x27;s city status was elevated to a core city.

<doc id="328684" wikidata="Q567083" url="?curid=328684" title="Annihilator (ring theory)">
<text>In mathematics, the annihilator of a subset of a module over a ring is the ideal formed by the elements of the ring that give always zero when multiplied by each element of . 

Over an integral domain, a module that has a nonzero annihilator is a torsion module, and a finitely generated torsion module has a nonzero annihilator.

The above definition applies also in the case of noncommutative rings, where the left annihilator of a left module is a left ideal, and the right-annihilator, of a right module is a right ideal.

==Definitions==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring, and let &quot;M&quot; be a left &quot;R&quot;-module. Choose a non-empty subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;M&quot;. The &quot;annihilator&quot; of &quot;S&quot;, denoted Ann&quot;R&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), is the set of all elements &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; such that, for all &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, . In set notation,
:formula_1 for all formula_2

It is the set of all elements of &quot;R&quot; that &quot;annihilate&quot; &quot;S&quot; (the elements for which &quot;S&quot; is a torsion set). Subsets of right modules may be used as well, after the modification of &quot;&quot; in the definition.

The annihilator of a single element &quot;x&quot; is usually written Ann&quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) instead of Ann&quot;R&quot;({&quot;x&quot;}). If the ring &quot;R&quot; can be understood from the context, the subscript &quot;R&quot; can be omitted.

Since &quot;R&quot; is a module over itself, &quot;S&quot; may be taken to be a subset of &quot;R&quot; itself, and since &quot;R&quot; is both a right and a left &quot;R&quot;-module, the notation must be modified slightly to indicate the left or right side. Usually formula_3 and formula_4 or some similar subscript scheme are used to distinguish the left and right annihilators, if necessary.

If &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-module and , then &quot;M&quot; is called a &quot;faithful module&quot;.

==Properties==
If &quot;S&quot; is a subset of a left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, then Ann(&quot;S&quot;) is a left ideal of &quot;R&quot;.

If &quot;S&quot; is a submodule of &quot;M&quot;, then Ann&quot;R&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is even a two-sided ideal: (&quot;ac&quot;)&quot;s&quot; = &quot;a&quot;(&quot;cs&quot;) = 0, since &quot;cs&quot; is another element of &quot;S&quot;.

If &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is the submodule of &quot;M&quot; generated by &quot;S&quot;, then in general Ann&quot;R&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) is a subset of Ann&quot;R&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), but they are not necessarily equal. If &quot;R&quot; is commutative, then the equality holds.

&quot;M&quot; may be also viewed as an &quot;R&quot;/Ann&quot;R&quot;(&quot;M&quot;)-module using the action formula_5. Incidentally, it is not always possible to make an &quot;R&quot;-module into an &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;-module this way, but if the ideal &quot;I&quot; is a subset of the annihilator of &quot;M&quot;, then this action is well-defined. Considered as an &quot;R&quot;/Ann&quot;R&quot;(&quot;M&quot;)-module, &quot;M&quot; is automatically a faithful module.

=== For commutative rings ===
Throughout this section, let formula_6 be a commutative ring and formula_7 a finitely generated formula_6-module.

==== Relation to support ====
The support of a module is defined as
:formula_9
Then, when the module is finitely generated, there is the relation
:formula_10,
where formula_11 is the set of prime ideals containing the subset.

==== Short exact sequences ====
Given a short exact sequence of modules,
:formula_12
the support property
:formula_13
together with the relation with the annihilator implies
:formula_14
More specifically, the relations
:formula_15
If the sequence splits then the inequality on the left is always an equality. This holds for arbitrary direct sums of modules, as
:formula_16

==== Quotient modules and annihilators ====
Given an ideal formula_17 and let formula_7 be a finitely generated module, then there is the relation
:formula_19
on the support. Using the relation to support, this gives the relation with the annihilator
:formula_20

== Examples ==

=== Over the integers ===
Over formula_21 any finitely generated module is completely classified as the direct sum of its free part with its torsion part from the fundamental theorem of abelian groups. Then the annihilator of a finitely generated module is non-trivial only if it is entirely torsion. This is because
:formula_22
since the only element killing each of the formula_21 is formula_24. For example, the annihilator of formula_25 is
:formula_26
the ideal generated by formula_27. In fact the annihilator of a torsion module
:formula_28
is isomorphic to the ideal generated by their least common multiple, formula_29. This shows the annihilators can be easily be classified over the integers.

=== Over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; ===
There is a similar computation that can be done for any finitely presented module over a commutative ring formula_6. The definition of finite presentedness of formula_7 implies there exists an exact sequence, called a presentation, given by
:formula_32
where formula_33 is in formula_34. Writing formula_33 explicitly as a matrix gives it as
:formula_36
hence formula_7 has the direct sum decomposition
:formula_38
If each of these ideals is written as
:formula_39
then the ideal formula_40 given by
:formula_41
presents the annihilator.

=== Over &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;] ===
Over the commutative ring formula_42 for a field formula_43, the annihilator of the module
:formula_44
is given by the ideal
:formula_45

==Chain conditions on annihilator ideals==
The lattice of ideals of the form formula_46 where &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;R&quot; is a complete lattice when partially ordered by inclusion. There is interest in studying rings for which this lattice (or its right counterpart) satisfies the ascending chain condition or descending chain condition.

Denote the lattice of left annihilator ideals of &quot;R&quot; as formula_47 and the lattice of right annihilator ideals of &quot;R&quot; as formula_48. It is known that formula_47 satisfies the ascending chain condition if and only if formula_48 satisfies the descending chain condition, and symmetrically formula_48 satisfies the ascending chain condition if and only if formula_47 satisfies the descending chain condition. If either lattice has either of these chain conditions, then &quot;R&quot; has no infinite pairwise orthogonal sets of idempotents. 

If &quot;R&quot; is a ring for which formula_47 satisfies the A.C.C. and &quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot; has finite uniform dimension, then &quot;R&quot; is called a left Goldie ring.

==Category-theoretic description for commutative rings==
When &quot;R&quot; is commutative and &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-module, we may describe Ann&quot;R&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) as the kernel of the action map determined by the adjunct map of the identity along the Hom-tensor adjunction.

More generally, given a bilinear map of modules formula_54, the annihilator of a subset formula_55 is the set of all elements in formula_56 that annihilate formula_57:
:formula_58
Conversely, given formula_59, one can define an annihilator as a subset of formula_7.

The annihilator gives a Galois connection between subsets of formula_7 and formula_56, and the associated closure operator is stronger than the span.
In particular:
* annihilators are submodules
* formula_63
* formula_64

An important special case is in the presence of a nondegenerate form on a vector space, particularly an inner product: then the annihilator associated to the map formula_65 is called the orthogonal complement.

==Relations to other properties of rings==
Given a module &quot;M&quot; over a Noetherian commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, a prime ideal of &quot;R&quot; that is an annihilator of a nonzero element of &quot;M&quot; is called an associated prime of &quot;M&quot;.

*Annihilators are used to define left Rickart rings and Baer rings.
*The set of (left) zero divisors &quot;D&quot;&quot;S&quot; of &quot;S&quot; can be written as
::formula_66
:(Here we allow zero to be a zero divisor.)
:In particular &quot;DR&quot; is the set of (left) zero divisors of &quot;R&quot; taking &quot;S&quot; = &quot;R&quot; and &quot;R&quot; acting on itself as a left &quot;R&quot;-module.

*When &quot;R&quot; is commutative and Noetherian, the set formula_67 is precisely equal to the union of the associated primes of the &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;R&quot;.

<doc id="328685" wikidata="Q5164282" url="?curid=328685" title="Constitutional convention (Australia)">
<text>Constitutional conventions in Australia are significant meetings that have debated the Australian Constitution. The first two gatherings debated Federation and what form of Constitution to adopt, while the following conventions debated amendments to the document. 

The draft Constitution that was the final product of the first two conventions was approved at referendum in 1899 and 1900 by a 72% &quot;Yes&quot; vote on a 58% turnout. There have been four of the latter conventions post Federation, but no constitutional proposal from these has been approved by referendum, and those put to referendum (proposals from the 1942 and 1998 conventions) were soundly defeated, reaching no more than 46% approval on 90% to 96% turnout. 

==1891 convention==
The 1891 Constitutional Convention was held in Sydney in March 1891 to consider a draft Frame of Government for the proposed federation of the British colonies in Australia and New Zealand. There were 46 delegates at the Convention, chosen by the seven colonial parliaments. Among the delegates was Sir Henry Parkes, known as the &quot;Father of Federation&quot;. The Convention approved a draft largely written by Andrew Inglis Clark from Tasmania and Samuel Griffith from Queensland, but the colonial parliaments failed to act to give effect to it.

==1897–1898 convention==
The next constitutional convention – the Australasian Federal Convention – was held in stages in 1897–98. Unlike the first convention, the delegates from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania were elected by popular vote. The delegates of Western Australia were chosen by its parliament. It met first in Adelaide in March 1897, then in Sydney in August, before, finally, it met again in Melbourne in January 1898. The intervals between the sessions were used for intense debate in the colonial parliaments and for public discussion of the draft constitution.

Since 1891, New Zealand had lost interest in federating with the Australian colonies, and was not represented. In Queensland, the parliament had not passed the necessary legislation, so the northern colony was also unrepresented. In the other five colonies ten delegates from each colony were elected by the people, although Western Australian attendance was sporadic. At Melbourne the convention finally produced a draft constitution which was eventually approved by the people at referendums in the colonies.

==1942 convention==
In November 1942, the Curtin government convened a constitutional convention for the sole purpose of discussing Attorney-General&#x27;s H. V. Evatt proposed addition to the constitution of section 60A. This would have made the powers of federal parliament virtually unlimited, declaring &quot;the power of the Parliament shall extend to all measures which in the declared opinion of the Parliament will tend to achieve economic security and social justice ... notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Constitution&quot;. The convention was held in Canberra and consisted of 24 members – six nominated by the federal government, six by the federal opposition, the six state premiers, and the six state leaders of the opposition. After an opening speech by Prime Minister John Curtin, Evatt announced that he was withdrawing his original draft due to public criticism and would substitute a watered-down series of proposals. The convention was immediately adjourned for 24 hours. It eventually appointed a drafting committee which produced the &quot;14 powers&quot; amendment that was put to a referendum in 1944.

That proposal was lost at the referendum, only gaining 46% of the vote and only passing in two out of the four states required.

==1973 convention==
The 1973 Constitutional Convention was established by the Whitlam government in 1973 to consider possible amendments to the Constitution which could be put to the people for approval at a referendum. The Convention, which was not elected but consisted of delegates chosen by the federal and state Parliaments, met through 1973–75 but achieved nothing as a result of non-support by the conservative parties.

==1998 convention==
The 1998 Constitutional Convention met in Canberra in February 1998. The Convention was convened by Prime Minister John Howard to fulfill a promise made by his predecessor as Liberal leader, Alexander Downer. During the Convention, Prime Minister John Howard dedicated an area of parkland to the south-east of Old Parliament House as Constitution Place, Canberra.

The Convention consisted of 152 delegates, of whom half were elected by the people and half were appointed by the federal government. This latter group included senior federal, state and territory politicians appointed by virtue of their positions.

The Convention was divided into four philosophical groups: those wanting to retain Australia&#x27;s existing constitutional monarchy, those wanting Australia to become a republic with a president chosen by the Parliament (&quot;indirect electionists&quot;), those wanting Australia to become a republic with a president elected by the people (&quot;direct electionists&quot;), and those having no fixed position or seeking a compromise between the other groups. In the fourth group, Republicans dominated both subgroups, but proved far from united in their views.

At the opening of the Convention, Prime Minister John Howard stated:

73 delegates voted in favour of the Bi-partisan appointment model, 57 against and 22 abstained. Not one constitutional monarchist delegate voted in favour. The policy of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy (ACM) and other monarchist groups was to oppose all republican models, including the minimalist McGarvie model. In response, John Howard stated to the Convention:

A number of republicans who supported direct election abstained from the vote (such as Ted Mack, Phil Cleary, and Clem Jones), thereby allowing the bi-partisan model to succeed. They reasoned that the model would be defeated at a referendum, and a second referendum called with direct election as the model.

<doc id="328687" wikidata="Q207307" url="?curid=328687" title="Robert Carlyle">
<text>Robert Carlyle (born 14 April 1961) is a Scottish actor. His film work includes: &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996), &quot;The Full Monty&quot; (1997), &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999), &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Jimmy Grimble&quot; (2000), &quot;The Beach&quot; (2000), &quot;The 51st State&quot; (2001), &quot;Eragon&quot; (2006), &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Legend of Barney Thomson&quot; (2015). He has been in the television shows &quot;Hamish Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and &quot;COBRA&quot;. 

He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for &quot;The Full Monty&quot; and a Gemini Award for &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work in the miniseries &quot;Human Trafficking&quot; (2005).

==Early life and education==
Carlyle was born on 14 April 1961 in Maryhill, Glasgow, the son of Elizabeth, a bus company employee, and Joseph Carlyle, a painter and decorator. He was raised by his father after his mother left when he was four years old.

Carlyle left North Kelvinside Secondary School at the age of 16 without any qualifications and worked for his father as a painter and decorator. He later attended night classes at Cardonald College, in Glasgow. He first became involved in drama at the Glasgow Arts Centre at the age of 21 (having been inspired by reading Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot;) and he later graduated from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD).

==Career==
In 1991, Carlyle and four friends founded a theatre company, Raindog (which was involved in television and film work). The same year he guest starred in &quot;The Bill&quot; and also starred in his first film, &quot;Riff-Raff&quot;, directed by Ken Loach.

In 1994, he played the gay lover of Father Greg in the film &quot;Priest&quot;. Carlyle&#x27;s first high-profile role came as serial killer Albie Kinsella in an October 1994 episode of &quot;Cracker&quot; opposite Robbie Coltrane and Christopher Eccleston. Carlyle claimed that his main inspiration for the role was Robert De Niro&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated performance as Travis Bickle in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. This highly acclaimed role showcased Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;pure intensity&quot;. Shortly after his appearance in &quot;Cracker&quot;, he landed the role of Highland policeman Hamish Macbeth in the BBC comedy-drama &quot;Hamish Macbeth&quot;. The series ran for three seasons from 1995 to 1997.

In 1996 and 1997, he appeared in the two highest-profile roles of his career to date: as the sociopathic Francis Begbie in &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and Gaz, the leader of a group of amateur male strippers, in &quot;The Full Monty&quot;. The latter earned Carlyle a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. He also starred with Ray Winstone in the 1997 film &quot;Face&quot;. Carlyle played the senior Malachy McCourt (father of author Frank McCourt) in the 1999 film adaptation of McCourt&#x27;s first memoir, &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;; the arch villain Renard in the 1999 James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;; and a cannibalistic soldier in the 1999 &quot;Ravenous&quot;.
Carlyle appeared in the 2002 Oasis music video for &quot;Little By Little&quot;. He played Adolf Hitler in the 2003 miniseries &quot;&quot;. In 2006 he played the villain Durza in &quot;Eragon&quot;. In 2007 Carlyle played one of the main characters in the film &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;. He also played the lead role as a marine engineer attempting to save London from total devastation in the disaster film &quot;Flood&quot;. That year he also portrayed Father Joseph Macavoy in the film &quot;The Tournament&quot;.

In 2008 Carlyle narrated a BBC audiobook version of &quot;The Cutting Room&quot;. In 2008, he was cast as Dr. Nicholas Rush in the television series &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. His was touted by the studio as the &quot;leading role&quot; in &quot;Universe&quot;.

In 2008, Carlyle appeared in &quot;24: Redemption&quot;, a television movie based on the TV series &quot;24&quot;, starring alongside Kiefer Sutherland.

In 2009, Carlyle appeared in &quot;The Man Who Walked Around The World,&quot; a long-form commercial for Johnnie Walker whisky. Carlyle was shown walking down a path and talking for six minutes in a single long take. The ad took two days to film. The director, Jamie Rafn, afterwards referred to Carlyle as an &quot;utter genius&quot;.

He voices the character of Gabriel Belmont, and his counterpart, Dracula, in the video game &quot;&quot;, as well as its sequels &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

From 2011 to 2018, Carlyle portrayed Rumplestiltskin / Mr. Gold in the fantasy-drama television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. The character is a wizard, deal-maker, and master manipulator. In an interview, Carlyle explained that his son inspired him to create Rumplestiltskin&#x27;s voice.

In 2019, he portrayed Ogilvy in a three-part television adaptation of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; for the BBC, and made an uncredited appearance as John Lennon in the film &quot;Yesterday&quot;. 
In 2020, he portrayed Robert Sutherland, the Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party in &quot;Cobra&quot;.

===Acting style===
Known for his commitment to authenticity in roles, Carlyle has often altered his lifestyle and physical appearance to gain a better understanding of a character; much akin to method acting. Before playing a homeless character in Antonia Bird&#x27;s &quot;Safe&quot;, for example, he went to live in the Waterloo area of London where the film was set. For his role as a bus driver in Ken Loach&#x27;s &quot;Carla&#x27;s Song&quot;, he passed the test for a PSV licence (a licence to drive a bus with passengers) in a Glasgow Leyland Atlantean bus. Carlyle also had dentistry as part of his preparations for reprising his role as Begbie in &quot;T2 Trainspotting,&quot; choosing to have a dental implant and an adjacent tooth that became damaged during the implant&#x27;s removal, extracted. Writing of Carlyle&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, Andrew Johnston stated: &quot;Carlyle was brilliant as the savage psycho Begbie in &quot;Trainspotting&quot;; here, he proves he can be almost as good when kept on a short leash. We don&#x27;t know much about Gaz, but he&#x27;s the most interesting character in the movie, largely because of Carlyle&#x27;s down-to-earth warmth.&quot;

==Personal life==
Carlyle has been married to make-up artist Anastasia Shirley since 1997. They have three children: a daughter born in 2002, and two sons born in 2004 and 2006. Carlyle is a patron of &#x27;School for Life&#x27; in Romania. He was appointed an OBE in 1999.

<doc id="328688" wikidata="Q6863427" url="?curid=328688" title="MindWrite">
<text>MindWrite is word processor software for early Macintosh computers running classic Mac OS. It was released in 1986 by MindWork Software, making it among the earliest 3rd party word processors on the platform. It was later distributed by Access Technologies, who then transferred their Mac software to a spinoff, DeltaPoint. Sales continued with DeltaPoint at least into the early 1990s.

The key feature of MindWrite was its integrated outliner, a system that allowed documents to be organized in a hierarchy and then re-arranged with drag-and-drop operations. After the release of the pioneering ThinkTank, such systems were considered to be a new way to organize knowledge and perform workflows. MindWrite was the first program to cleanly integrate an outliner with a word processor, and this generated considerable press for the product. The system was otherwise fairly simple in terms of style and layout options and initially lacked a spell checker, issues that were always noted in reviews. Additionally, it was very slow.

An outliner was added to Microsoft Word version 3. When Microsoft began offering software bundles for the Mac, sales of alternative solutions slowed. The product changed hands several times before going dormant in the 1990s. It cannot be used on Macintosh systems higher than 7.0.

==History==
Cary Wyman and Dennis Moncrief formed AthenaSoft to produce Icon Review, an early mail order catalog of software for the recently-released Macintosh. The ultimate goal was to build up a client base which they would then use as the basis for marketing their own software. The program was first advertised as MultiWrite in Icon Review&#x27;s Summer catalog, which arrived in June. However, the program was not ready at this point, and did not ship until 20 November 1986, which led to &quot;a huge number of complaints.&quot;

This arrangement with AthenaSoft worked for a time, but as work on MindWrite continued it proved too difficult to manage and Wyman split off MindWork Software in 1987. Looking for a distributor, in late 1987 MindWork was purchased by Access Technologies, a minicomputer software vendor whose primary product was a spreadsheet program known as 20/20. Access felt that it needed to shift into the microcomputer market as the power of these platforms grew. This led Access to purchase both MindWork and Data Taylor, creators of the Mac spreadsheet Trapeze.

Not long after, Access decided to wind up operations entirely and began looking for potential purchasers. They spun out their Mac products under the DeltaPoint name in order to simplify the offering. The remaining minicomputer portion was purchased by Computer Associates. DeltaPoint continued on its own, using sales of MindWrite and Trapeze to fund the development of a new program, DeltaGraph. DeltaGraph would go on to be a best-seller and continues to be offered through a new developer. Wyman later developed a new word processor for the Mac, Taste, which DeltaPoint distributed in the early 1990s.

==Description==
MindWrite will appear familiar to any user of early classic MacOS software, especially MacWrite. It does, however, offer many more features. For one, in contrast to MacWrite which allowed only one document to be opened at once, MindWrite allowed four to be opened in separate windows and text could be easily cut and pasted between them. It supported much larger documents, which would have to be broken up into parts in MacWrite. It allowed a new layout ruler to be inserted at any point, easing layout changes. It also allowed editing with both the mouse and cursor keys, although it did not allow text selection using the keyboard, only movement. Some of the more advanced features included a word count, and the ability to mark sections as being changed.

The most notable feature, however, is the outliner system. The document could be marked up with section separators, which defined the levels. A user-selected marker, normally a diamond, appears beside paragraphs. Additional text is normally added at the same level but can be dragged to become a sub-level using the mouse. Sections can be collapsed or expanded by clicking on their marker and can be displayed as empty or with the first line of text when in the collapsed state. When the user moves the mouse over one of the section markers, the pointer turns into a hand, and holding down the mouse button shows it being &quot;pinched&quot; and thus indicating it can be moved. The outline is used as the basis for both the table of contents (TOC) and an optional paragraph numbering feature; one oddity is that the table of contents matches the style of the text in that section header, making the formatting of the TOC difficult.

MindWrite could read files from MacWrite and ThinkTank, as well as plain ASCII text. It could write MacWrite and ASCII. MindWrite 2.0 added Microsoft Word to this list, and featured built-in integration with the Spellswell spell checker. The separate MindWriteExpress application, released at the same time, added over twenty additional formats, allowing it to exchange files with various PC programs as well as minicomputers and even dedicated word processor computers like the Wang series.

==Reception==
In a &quot;First Look&quot; column published shortly after its initial release, &quot;InfoWorld&quot;&#x27;s Michael Miller praises the concept of the program, saying he was a &quot;great fan of the outlining concept&quot; while finding that &quot;the world processing and outlining don&#x27;t combine as smoothly as they should in most products.&quot; He details the outlining capabilities and praises its clean integration in the program, but complains about the performance, noting &quot;you can type ahead f it, though the program will eventually catch up.&quot; The company was already promising a future upgrade that would address these problems, which he concludes would mean the $125 price would make it &quot;one of the best buys in the Mac software arena.&quot;

A more thorough look at the program led to a lengthy three-page review by Charles Rubin. It opens by praising the overall program by noting &quot;the program&#x27;s outlining is both powerful and flexible, and it is smoothly integrated with Mindwrite&#x27;s word processing features&quot;. However, it immediately notes that it does not include a spell checker and some formatting capabilities seen in Microsoft Word, and that &quot;Our tests showed Mindwrite to be considerably slower than competing programs at many functions.&quot; He concludes that the program is merely &quot;satisfactory&quot; in spite of its ease of use and powerful integration.

&quot;MacUser&quot; made the program its cover story in August 1987. The reviewer, Henry Bortman, starts out by stating &quot;MindWrite is a serious, heavy-duty word processor. Powerful integrating outlining and true writer&#x27;s features add up to a superior program.&quot; After noting some of the missing features, like a spell checker and automatic hyphenation, Bortman suggests that the outliner &quot;does something better than all of that.&quot; It also noted that it was rushed to release with many bugs remaining and the speed, &quot;it&#x27;s not super-slow, but scrolling could definitely stand some speeding up.&quot; It concludes with a four-out-of-five rating, with five stars for documentation, support and value, and three for UI, on-screen help and performance.

One of the few negative reviews of the program appeared in the Washington Apple Pi newsletter&#x27;s April 1987 edition. The reviewer, Fred Seelig, stated &quot;You should not buy it... It is unreliable. It does not do what it promises. And its commands and operating structure will drive you nuts.&quot; Although it describes a number of advanced features lacking in other word processors on the platform, including multiple paragraph rulers, cursor key control and table of contents, and states that it &quot;has a lot of nice features that leaves MacWrite in the dust.&quot; But also points out a number of bugs, including some crashes. It concludes, &quot;... so far my candidate for Worst Word Processor of the Decade is surely MindWrite.&quot;

In a survey of five Macintosh word processors, &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; in 1987 wrote that MindWrite&#x27;s &quot;word processor is a pleasure in itself&quot;, and stated that the &quot;excellent outline processor fuses directly with&quot; it. The magazine criticized its slow speed, however, and suggested that customers might want to wait until bugs were fixed.

A follow-up review of the 1.1 version in &quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1988 noted the program was being repositioned from a power-user word processor to a power-user outliner with &quot;word processing features&quot; while raising the price to $295. They praised improvements in the outliner, rating most features as &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot;. They continued to note the lack of spell checker and the poor overall speed, which they rated as &quot;poor&quot;. They suggest the performance is usable for small one-page documents, but when it was &quot;expanded to five pages, it was noticeably slow when copying text and saving files. At ten pages it was downright sluggish.&quot; This article went to press just as MindWrite 2.0 was being released, which added a 3rd party spell checker and numerous other features while claiming significantly improved speed.

Ted Silveira reviewed 1.1 for &quot;MacUser&quot;&#x27;s February 1988 edition. He praised the integration of the program and noted that 1.1 fixed most of the more noticeable bugs and performance issues in 1.0, while adding support for AppleShare networks and the Mac Lightning spell checker. He was particularly happy with the window management options, which allowed multiple open documents to be easily organized and moved about even if they were not visible at the time. The improved speed fixed the overall problem but was noted as still being slower than Word during scrolling and global reformats. It concludes that &quot;1.1 is a major improvement over the problem-ridden 1.0 - it not only fixes the outstanding problems but also feels solid where the earlier version did not.&quot; It concludes &quot;In short, for all its fancy footwork, MindWrite stumbles over details&quot; and receives a four-out-of-five rating.

In June 1987, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; published an article on the overall status of the Mac word processing market. By this point, Microsoft Word already held 56% of the market, with MacWrite at 31%, Write Now at 3% and MindWrite at 2%. All others together made up 8%. By the time 2.0 shipped in the spring of 1988, it was already seen as something of a minor story, being mentioned only in passing in a news item in &quot;InfoWorld&quot;.

<text>The Colour of Magic is a 1983 fantasy comedy novel by Terry Pratchett, and is the first book of the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. The first printing of the British edition consisted of only 506 copies. Pratchett has described it as &quot;an attempt to do for the classical fantasy universe what &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; did for Westerns.&quot;

==Plot summary==

===Setting===
The story takes place on the Discworld, a planet-sized flat disc carried through space on the backs of four gargantuan elephants – Berilia, Tubul, Great T&#x27;Phon and Jerakeen – who themselves stand on the shell of Great A&#x27;Tuin, a gigantic star turtle. The surface of the disc contains oceans and continents, and with them, civilisations, cities, forests and mountains.

===Summary===
The story begins in Ankh-Morpork, the biggest city on the Discworld. The main character is an incompetent and cynical wizard named Rincewind, who is hired as a guide to naive Twoflower, an insurance clerk from the Agatean Empire who has come to visit Ankh-Morpork. Thanks to the abundance of gold in his homeland, Twoflower, though only a clerk, is immensely rich compared to inhabitants of Ankh-Morpork. Initially attempting to flee with his advance payment for agreeing to be Twoflower&#x27;s guide, Rincewind is captured by the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, who forces him to protect Twoflower, lest the tourist&#x27;s death provoke the Agatean Emperor into invading Ankh-Morpork. After Twoflower is kidnapped by a gang of thieves and taken to the Broken Drum tavern, Rincewind stages a rescue alongside the Luggage, an indestructible, enchanted and sentient chest belonging to Twoflower. Before this, Twoflower convinces the Broken Drum&#x27;s landlord to take out a fire insurance policy at an inflated valuation (Twoflower having a poor grasp of local prices). When the landlord inevitably burns down the tavern to claim the money, the fire spreads and destroys the whole of Ankh-Morpork. Rincewind and Twoflower escape in the chaos.

Rincewind and Twoflower travel towards the city of Quirm, unaware that their adventures on this journey are actually the subject of a boardgame played by the Gods of the Discworld. The pair are separated when they are attacked by a mountain troll summoned by Offler the Crocodile God. The ignorant Twoflower ends up being led to the Temple of Bel-Shamharoth, a being said to be the opposite of both good and evil, while Rincewind ends up imprisoned in a dryad-inhabited tree in the woods, where he watches the events in Bel Shamharoth&#x27;s temple through a magical portal. The pair are reunited when Rincewind escapes into the temple through the portal, and they encounter Hrun the Barbarian, a parody of heroes in the Swords and Sorcery genre. The trio are attacked and nearly killed by Bel-Shamharoth, but escape when Rincewind accidentally blinds the creature with Twoflower&#x27;s magical picture box. Hrun agrees to travel with and protect Twoflower and Rincewind in exchange for heroic pictures of him from the picture box. 
The trio visit the Wyrmberg, an upside-down mountain which is home to dragon-riders who summon their dragons by imagining them, and are separated when the riders attack them. Rincewind escapes capture but is forced by Kring, Hrun&#x27;s sentient magical sword, to attempt to rescue his friends. Twoflower is imprisoned within the Wyrmberg, and because of his fascination with dragons, is able to summon one greater than those of the Wyrmberg riders, whom he names Ninereeds, allowing him to escape captivity and save Rincewind from being killed in a duel with one of the three heirs of the Wyrmburg. Twoflower, Rincewind and Ninereeds snatch Hrun, but as they attempt to escape into the skies, Twoflower passes out from the lack of oxygen, causing Ninereeds to disappear. Hrun is saved by Liessa, but Rincewind and Twoflower find themselves falling to their deaths. In desperation, Rincewind manages to use the Wyrmberg&#x27;s power to temporarily summon a passenger jet from the real world, before he and Twoflower fall into the ocean.

The two of them are taken to the edge of the Discworld by the ocean currents and nearly carried over, but they are caught by the Circumfence, a huge net built by the nation of Krull to catch sea life and flotsam washed in from the rest of the Discworld. They are rescued by Tethis the sea troll, a being composed of water who had fallen off the edge of his own world and onto the Discworld, where he was subsequently enslaved by the Krullians. The Krullians then take Rincewind and Twoflower to their capital, where they inform them that they intend to use a space capsule to launch over the edge of the Disc in order to learn the sex of Great A&#x27;Tuin, and that they also intend to sacrifice Rincewind and Twoflower in order to appease the god Fate, who insisted on their sacrifice after they cost him the earlier game. Rincewind and Twoflower attempt to escape, but end up stealing the capsule, which is launched with Twoflower inside, the tourist wishing to see the other worlds of the universe. Rincewind is unable to get into the capsule in time, and falls off the Disc alongside it, the Luggage following them soon after.

The story segues into the beginning of &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;.

==Characters==

*Bel-Shamharoth aka &quot;The Soul Eater&quot;, &quot;The Sender of Eight&quot;
*Hrun, the Barbarian, aka Hrun of Chimeria
*Liessa Wyrmbidder aka Lianna
*the Luggage
*Rincewind, and his Roundworld alias, Dr Rjinswand
*Twoflower, and his Roundworld alias, Jack Zweiblumen

==Structure==

&quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; is one of the few &quot;Discworld&quot; novels to be divided into sections or chapters, the others being &quot;Pyramids&quot;, &quot;Going Postal&quot;, and &quot;Making Money&quot;, along with the Discworld novels for younger readers, which consist of the five Tiffany Aching books (&quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, &quot;Wintersmith&quot;, &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, and &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;) and &quot;The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents&quot;.

The sections are: 
* The Colour of Magic – Prologue
* The Colour of Magic
* The Sending of Eight – Prologue
* The Sending of Eight
* The Lure of the Wyrm
* Close to the Edge

The four main parts are lengthy, and have been likened to short stories or novellas rather than chapters.

In the section &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, the characters Bravd and The Weasel relate to Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser from Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Sword&quot; series. &quot;The Sending of Eight&quot; has Lovecraftian references, and &quot;The Lure of the Wyrm&quot; parodies Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s &quot;Dragonflight&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Graphic novel===
A graphic novel, illustrated by Steven Ross and adapted by Scott Rockwell, was first published as a four-part comic in 1991 by the Innovative Corporation, of Wheeling, WV and then published as a single volume by Corgi on 12 November 1992. Part 1 was originally announced for publication by Innovative on 10 December 1990, but it was delayed as Terry Pratchett had not been shown the artwork for approval as contractually required and disliked it, so the first issue had to be redrawn.

The graphic novel is split up into several chapters like the book, and is faithful to the source material in that it is built up like classic barbarian stories (in this case comics &quot;à la&quot; &quot;Red Sonja&quot;). Crucial differences between the book and comic include the cutting-out of some of the adventures in Ankh-Morpork and Krull, along with combining the characters of Galder Weatherwax and Ymper Trymon. Also, in the book, the female Dragonriders are described as being topless, as barbarian women in fiction tend to be. However, in the graphic novel the women wear chain-mail chestpieces as well as the clothing described in the book. It has been published in hardcover, along with the graphic novel of &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, as &quot;The Discworld Graphic Novels&quot; ().

===TV adaptation===

The Mob Film Company and Sky One have produced a two-part adaptation, combining both &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, directed by Vadim Jean and broadcast over Easter, 2008. David Jason starred in the role of Rincewind. Sean Astin, best known for his role as Samwise Gamgee in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series, took the role of Twoflower. Christopher Lee took over the role of Death from Ian Richardson (a role Lee had previously played in the animated series &quot;Soul Music&quot; and &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;).

===Computer game===

The plot was adapted for a text adventure computer game in 1986, by Delta 4 and released by Piranha, a Macmillan subsidiary, in Amstrad/CDC, Commodore and Spectrum formats.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #64, and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s one of those horrible, antisocial books which impel the reader to buttonhole friends and quote bits at them. My ceiling is covered with brown spots from when I tried to read Pratchett&#x27;s jokes and drink beer at the same time. Only native sadism makes me recommend this disgraceful work.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Terry Pratchett does for sword and sorcery what Douglas Adams did for science fiction.&quot;

In 2015, Sam Jordison at &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave a positive review of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;. He discussed the arguments that it may not be the best introduction to the series: later books are more highly regarded; it does little to develop its characters and ideas; and modern readers may not be familiar with the &quot;pre-1990s fantasy conventions&quot; it lampoons. However, he argued that the book is &quot;still more than worth reading in and of itself&quot;, praising its gags and satire. &quot;Indeed, The Colour of Magic is the perfect introduction because it leaves me hungry for more.&quot;

<doc id="328691" wikidata="Q469969" url="?curid=328691" title="The Light Fantastic">
<text>The Light Fantastic is a comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, the second of the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It was published on 2 June 1986, the first printing being of 1,034 copies. The title is taken from &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot;, a poem by John Milton, and refers to dancing lightly with extravagance, although in the novel it is explained as &quot;the light that lies on the far side of darkness, the light fantastic. It was a rather disappointing purple colour.&quot;

The events of the novel are a direct continuation of those in the preceding book, &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The book begins shortly after the ending of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, with wizard Rincewind, the tourist Twoflower, and the Luggage falling from the Discworld. They are saved when the Octavo, the most powerful book of magic on the Discworld, readjusts reality to prevent the loss of one of its eight spells. The spell had lodged in Rincewind&#x27;s head when he was a student at Unseen University. Rincewind, Twoflower and the Luggage end up in the Forest of Skund. The wizards of Ankh-Morpork use the Rite of Ashk-Ente to summon Death to find an explanation for the Octavo&#x27;s actions. Death warns them that the Discworld will soon be destroyed by a huge red star unless the eight spells of the Octavo are read.

Several orders of wizards travel to the forest of Skund to capture Rincewind, who is currently staying with Twoflower and the Luggage in a gingerbread house in the forest. In the subsequent chaos, Rincewind and Twoflower escape on an old witch&#x27;s broom. The Archchancellor of Unseen University attempts to obtain the spell, but accidentally summons the Luggage on top of him, crushing him to death. His apprentice, Ymper Trymon, uses the opportunity to advance his own power, intending to obtain the eight spells for himself.

Rincewind and Twoflower encounter a sect of druids who have assembled a &quot;computer&quot; from large standing stones, and learn of the approaching red star. As Twoflower attempts to stop the druids from sacrificing a young woman named Bethan, Cohen the Barbarian, an octogenarian parody of Conan, attacks the druids. Twoflower is poisoned in the battle, forcing Rincewind to travel to Death&#x27;s Domain to rescue him. The pair narrowly avoid being killed by Ysabell, Death&#x27;s adopted daughter. As they escape, the Octavo tells Rincewind that it had arranged for its eighth spell to escape into his head, to ensure the spells could not be used before the appointed time.

Rincewind and Twoflower travel with Cohen and Bethan to a nearby town, where the toothless Cohen leaves to have dentures made, having learned of them from Twoflower. Rincewind, Twoflower and Bethan are attacked by a mob of people who believe the star is coming to destroy the Discworld in response to the presence of magic. The trio escape into a magical travelling shop, one of many that sell strange and sinister goods and vanish inexplicably the next time a customer tries to find them. These shops travel the multiverse, set adrift by a sorcerer&#x27;s curse on the shopkeeper for not having something in stock. The three are able to return to Ankh-Morpork via the shop.

As the star comes nearer and the magic on the Discworld weakens, Trymon tries to put the seven spells still in the Octavo into his mind, in an attempt to save the world and gain ultimate power. However, the spells prove too strong for him and his mind becomes a door into the &quot;Dungeon Dimensions&quot;, home of terrifying creatures. Rincewind and Twoflower manage to kill the now-mutated Trymon.

Rincewind reads all eight of the Octavo&#x27;s spells aloud. This causes eight moons of the red star to crack open, birthing eight infant world-turtles. They follow their parent Great A&#x27;Tuin, the massive turtle who carries the Discworld, on a course away from the star. The Octavo falls and is eaten by the Luggage.

Cohen and Bethan leave to get married. Twoflower and Rincewind part company as Twoflower decides to return home, leaving the Luggage with Rincewind as a parting gift. Rincewind decides to re-enroll in the university, believing that with the spell out of his head, he will finally be able to learn magic.

==Characters==

*Rincewind - the most pathetic wizard on the disc
*Twoflower - a naive tourist from the exotic Counterweight Continent
*the Luggage - a sentient trunk with a homicidal attitude 
*D - the Grim Reaper, speaks for itself doesn&#x27;t it?
*Ymper Trymon - an ambitious wizard in the Unseen University
*Galder Weatherwax - ArchChancellor of the Unseen University
*The Librarian - speak for itself
*Cohen - a &quot;very&quot; old hero
*Bethan - a druid virgin sacrifice who doesn&#x27;t want to be saved

==Releases==
The cover of a United States paperback release features a mistake, with Cohen&#x27;s name stated to be &quot;Conan&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Graphic novel===
A graphic novel adapted by Scott Rockwell and illustrated by Steven Ross and Joe Bennet, was first published as a four-part comic in June, August, December 1992 and February 1993 by the Innovative Corporation of Wheeling WV, before being published as a single volume by Corgi on 4 November 1993. It has been published in hardcover along with the graphic novel of The Colour of Magic, as &quot;The Discworld Graphic Novels.&quot; ()

===TV adaptation===

The Mob Film Company and Sky One produced a miniseries, combining both &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, broadcast on Easter Sunday and Monday 2008. Sir David Jason played the part of Rincewind. He was joined by David Bradley as Cohen the Barbarian, Sean Astin as Twoflower, Tim Curry as Trymon, and Christopher Lee taking over the role of Death from Ian Richardson (a role he previously portrayed in the animated series Soul Music and Wyrd Sisters).

The production team wanted to get fans involved in the adaptation so some of the extras used in the adaptation (in mob scenes and during the fight in the Broken Drum) were Discworld fans who were selected via various website and Newsletters.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #83, and stated that &quot;Abandoning the cruel fantasy parodies of his previous book, Pratchett leans more heavily on the one-line gags: the result isn&#x27;t as pointedly funny, but still evokes more laughs than anything else around. &quot;Especially&quot; Thrud.&quot;

<text>Rosanna Lisa Arquette (; born August 10, 1959) is an American actress. She was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance in the TV film &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; (1982) and won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for the film &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985). Her other film roles include &quot;After Hours&quot; (also 1985), &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988), &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), and &quot;Crash&quot; (1996). She also directed the documentary &quot;Searching for Debra Winger&quot; (2002) and starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;What About Brian?&quot; from 2006 to 2007.

==Early life==
Arquette was born in New York City, on August 10, 1959, the daughter of Brenda Olivia &quot;Mardi&quot; (&quot;née&quot; Nowak), an actress, poet, theater operator, activist, acting teacher, and therapist, and Lewis Arquette, a film actor and producer. Her paternal grandfather was comedian Cliff Arquette. Her mother was Jewish, from a family that emigrated from Poland and Russia. Her father, whose original family surname was &quot;Arcouet&quot;, was of part French-Canadian descent. Her father was a convert from Catholicism to Islam. Her four siblings, Richmond, Patricia, Alexis, and David, also became actors.

==Career==
Arquette has appeared in both television and feature films since 1977. One of her first noticeable roles was in &quot;S.O.B.&quot; (1981), directed by Blake Edwards. She earned an Emmy Award nomination for the TV film &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; (1982). However, she was unhappy with the film&#x27;s nude scene, remarking in an interview that the idea of the general public seeing her naked made her feel uncomfortable and exploited, and that most of the offers she had received since demanded that she similarly expose herself. Her first starring role was in John Sayles&#x27;s film, &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot; (1983), highly regarded by Rotten Tomatoes reviewers but not widely distributed. She co-starred in &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985) alongside pop superstar Madonna, for which Arquette won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role despite appearing in the leading role. In an interview at the time, Arquette said &quot;The two questions I hate the most are &#x27;What was it like working with Madonna?&#x27; and &#x27;Are you the Rosanna in the song &quot;Rosanna&quot;?&#x27;&quot; Following the commercial and critical success of Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s &quot;Silverado&quot; (also 1985), the limited success of the Martin Scorsese film &quot;After Hours&quot; (also 1985) and the commercial flop &quot;8 Million Ways to Die&quot; (1986), also a critical failure, she quit Hollywood to work in Europe, acting in Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988). Director Scorsese then offered her a part in his segment of &quot;New York Stories&quot; (1989).

Arquette&#x27;s other movies of note are &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and the David Cronenberg film &quot;Crash&quot; and the Australian film &quot;Wendy Cracked a Walnut&quot; (1990, also known as &quot;...Almost&quot;). In 1990, she appeared on the cover and in a nude pictorial in &quot;Playboy&quot;″s September issue, although she said it was without her prior knowledge or consent. Arquette starred in Sondra Locke&#x27;s &quot;Trading Favors,&quot; played Angelina Jolie&#x27;s mother in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; and later appeared as the girlfriend of Jolie&#x27;s real-life father Jon Voight on &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;.

In 2017, Arquette alleged (along with almost a hundred other women from the entertainment industry), that the then film producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her, threatened her because of her refusal to enter his hotel room, and subsequently saw to it that she was paid less for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, then no longer cast her in A-list lead roles because of her rejection of his quid pro quo sexual harassment proposition; Weinstein was convicted of sex offences in 2020. When news broke about Weinstein&#x27;s sexual offending in October 2017, Arquette was one of the first actresses to speak openly about his misconduct, with Ronan Farrow for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Jodi Kantor. In the documentary &quot;Untouchable&quot; (2019) about Weinstein focusing on those who accused him of sexual abuse, Arquette, Paz de la Huerta, and Erika Rosenbaum were among those interviewed.

Arquette has expanded into directing, including the documentaries &quot;Searching for Debra Winger&quot; (2002) and &quot;All We Are Saying&quot; (2005); she also produced both projects. Arquette appeared in &quot;What About Brian&quot; as Nicole Varsi and in Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The L Word&quot; as Cherie Jaffe. She also guest-starred in &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; as a healer named Anita.

In 2009, she joined &quot;Fit Parent Magazine&quot;, founded by Craig Knight, as Editor at Large. Arquette starred in the 2011 French thriller &quot;The Divide&quot;, directed by Xavier Gens. She had a featured role in the 2012 comedy &quot;Peace, Love &amp; Misunderstanding&quot; with Jane Fonda.

In an August 8, 2019 interview with TheWrap, Arquette said the FBI advised her to make her Twitter account private after online critics complained about her tweeting that she had shame for being &quot;white and privileged&quot;.

==Personal life==
The Toto song &quot;Rosanna&quot; was written by David Paich, who has claimed that the song is based on numerous girls he had known. However, as a joke, the band members initially played along with the common assumption that the song was based on Arquette, who was dating Toto keyboard player Steve Porcaro at the time. Arquette herself played along with the joke, commenting in an interview that the song was about &quot;my showing up at 4 a.m., bringing them juice and beer at their sessions.&quot;

Arquette was romantically involved with Peter Gabriel for several years, after his 1987 divorce to his wife Jill Moore. Arquette has said on some occasions that his 1986 song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; was inspired by her, although Gabriel has never confirmed that to be true, and has explained that he drew inspiration for the song from other sources. Arquette&#x27;s first three marriages—to director Tony Greco, film composer James Newton Howard, and restaurateur John Sidel—ended in divorce. She has one daughter with Sidel. In August 2013, Arquette married her fourth husband, investment banker Todd Morgan, following a two-year engagement. In January 2022, Todd Morgan filed for divorce from Arquette after 8 years of marriage.

Arquette has described her diet as &quot;vegetarian for the most part&quot;.

In August 2019, Arquette posted a Twitter rant about her experience with white guilt, stating; &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I was born white and privileged. It disgusts me. And I feel so much shame.&quot; She later claimed the FBI told her to set her Twitter page to private due to the reaction she received after posting.

==Philanthropy==
In 2010, Arquette became Goodwill Ambassador for The Womanity Foundation.

<doc id="328705" wikidata="Q7687666" url="?curid=328705" title="Taste (software)">
<text>Taste is a Macintosh word processor that combined a number of basic features from page layout software—just a &quot;taste&quot; of it—to build a unique solution to preparing documents. Taste was originally offered by DeltaPoint, the publishers of the famed MindWrite, but was eventually spun off to a third party before finally disappearing. Taste works with Mac OS 9, but not macOS, and has not been available for purchase for several years. In many ways Apple&#x27;s recent Pages application shares the basic &quot;idea&quot; of Taste, combining word processing with page layout.

Originally expected to retail for $99 in the low-end of the word processing market, Taste included a graphical page layout with an integrated drawing package and an address book with the capability of mail-merging. The product was available in 1991 for $149 with a scope of features found in many typical word processing packages, such as spelling checking, graphs and contents page generation. Like a word processor, Taste allowed the user to simply start typing and continue doing so until they were finished. There was no need, as in a typical page layout program, to create a box to hold the text, or manually add pages or link columns as the document grew. Like a page layout program, Taste also allowed the user to add these boxes if needed, as well as adjust the distance between characters (kerning) or between lines in a paragraph. Fairly complex graphics can be created within this program.

Oddly Taste also lacks a number of features of MindWrite, although it appears to have been written by an entirely different programming team. For instance, Taste does not have a built-in outliner, the &quot;killer feature&quot; of MindWrite which made it a favorite for many years. Nor does Taste include features like sorting or list generation.

==Reception==
Taste was released in early 1991.

Ted Landau of &quot;MacUser&quot; awarded version 1.01 four stars out of five, praising the sophistication of its graphics-creation tools and deeming it more capable than MacWrite and WriteNow, both of which were more expensive at the time. However he called the word processing features less than advanced and noted a number of bugs that &quot;can begin to erode your confidence in the reliability of an otherwise outstanding program&quot;, including text sometimes not being drawn onto the next line after being wrapped.

&quot;Macworld&quot; magazine gave version 1.02 two stars out of five, with reviewer Michael Miley calling Taste well-priced for its feature set and its interface clearly laid out and easy to use. Ultimately he found it a slow performer and prone to crashes when importing large Word files.

Journalists for &quot;Byte&quot; reviewed the same version and found it flexible as a word processor with &quot;strong&quot; page layout features that are easy to configure but disliked the separation of the text and graphics functions, and, like Landau, they encountered some difficulty with word wrapping. They concluded that &quot;If the material you write often gets poured into a page-layout program, you can save some time, effort, and money with Taste&quot;.

<doc id="328706" wikidata="Q1453449" url="?curid=328706" title="Free Trade Party">
<text>The Free Trade Party (FTP), officially known as the Free Trade and Liberal Association and also referred to as the Revenue Tariff Party in some states, was an Australian political party. It was formally organised in 1887 in New South Wales, in time for the 1887 New South Wales colonial election, which the party won.

The party advocated the abolition of protectionism, especially protective tariffs and other restrictions on trade, arguing that this would create greater prosperity for all. However, many members also advocated use of minimal tariffs for government revenue purposes only. Its most prominent leader was George Reid, who led the Reid government as the fourth Prime Minister of Australia (1904–1905). 

In New South Wales, it was succeeded by the Liberal and Reform Association in 1902, and federally by the Anti-Socialist Party in 1906. In 1909, the Anti-Socialist Party merged with the Protectionist Party to form the Liberal Party.

==History==
The party was centred on New South Wales, where its leaders were Sir Henry Parkes and Sir George Reid. It dominated New South Wales colonial politics before federation. It first contested the 1887 New South Wales election.

At the 1901 elections for the first Commonwealth Parliament, the Free Traders, who campaigned in some states as the Revenue Tariff Party, formed the second largest group in the Australian House of Representatives, with 25 seats. Reid became the Parliament&#x27;s first Opposition Leader with William McMillan as his deputy, later becoming Prime Minister in 1904–05. Dugald Thomson became deputy leader of the party in early 1904 following McMillan&#x27;s retirement. Thomson would himself hand over the Deputy position to Joseph Cook on 28 July 1905 following the fall of the Reid government.

A separate Tasmanian Revenue Tariff Party contested the 1903 federal election in Tasmania and won two seats. However, the Tasmanian party sat and merged with the Free Trade Party in federal Parliament.

After the question of tariffs had largely been settled, Reid cast around for another cause to justify his party&#x27;s existence. He settled on opposition to socialism, criticising both the Australian Labour Party and the support offered by it to the Protectionist Party, led by Alfred Deakin. Reid adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed the Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.

The Labor Party and the FTP/ASP continued to grow in electoral strength at the expense of the Protectionist vote. Some Protectionists continued their exodus to Labor and the ASP.

When Deakin proposed the Commonwealth Liberal Party, a &quot;Fusion&quot; of the two non-Labour parties, Reid announced his intention to resign as party leader on 16 November 1908. Joseph Cook was elected leader unopposed on 26 November, and he led the party until the merger with the Protectionists. No deputy leader was elected under Cook.

<text>The Protectionist Party, also known as the Protectionist Liberal Party or Liberal Protectionist Party, was an Australian political party, formally organised from 1887 until 1909, with policies centred on protectionism. The party advocated protective tariffs, arguing it would allow Australian industry to grow and provide employment. It had its greatest strength in Victoria and in the rural areas of New South Wales. Its most prominent leaders were Sir Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin, who were the first and second prime ministers of Australia.

== History ==
The party was initially centred on New South Wales, where its leaders were George Dibbs and William Lyne. It dominated New South Wales colonial politics before federation. It first contested the 1887 New South Wales election.

On the commencement of the Commonwealth of Australia, Governor-General-designate, The 7th Earl of Hopetoun, appointed Edmund Barton (after the Hopetoun Blunder), leader of the Protectionist Party, to head a caretaker government from 1 January 1901 until the election of a Parliament. At the first federal election in 1901, the Protectionists won 31 of the 75 seats in the House of Representatives. Barton was able to form the Barton minority government with the support of the Labour Party led by Chris Watson, which held the balance of power with 14 seats, on the understanding that the Protectionists would implement a number of social reforms desired by Labour. Labour&#x27;s program, however, was frequently too radical for many Protectionists, creating internal conflict between those who, like H. B. Higgins, were sympathetic to Labour, while conservatives like Allan McLean preferred to support the Free Trade Party.

On 25 August 1903, legislation to set up the High Court of Australia consisting of three judges was finally passed. Barton resigned his party leadership position on 24 September 1903 to be replaced by Deakin who then formed the first Deakin government. Then, on 5 October 1903, Deakin appointed Barton, as well as the party&#x27;s Senate leader, Richard O&#x27;Connor, to be justices of the High Court, before calling the 1903 federal election for December and going into caretaker government mode. At the election, the number of seats won by the Protectionists declined to 26 while Labour&#x27;s increased to 22, but Labour continued its policy of supporting a minority Deakin Protectionist government.

After a falling-out in April 1904 between Labour&#x27;s Watson and Deakin, Deakin resigned office. Free Trade leader George Reid declined to take office, leaving Watson and Labour to form its first minority government, which lasted for four months. In August 1904, Reid was able to form a Free Trade government with Protectionist support. Reid&#x27;s government lasted until 5 July 1905, when the Protectionists and Labour reconciled, and the previous arrangement was restored, with the formation of the second Deakin government. On 12 October 1906, the size of the High Court was increased to five justices, and Deakin appointed prominent Protectionists Higgins and Isaac Isaacs to the High Court to get them out of politics, but they were qualified for the judicial position, as they had been lawyers. Higgins was Attorney-General in the Labour government of 1904 (Labour did not have a lawyer to appoint), and Isaacs was Attorney-General in 1905 in the Deakin government. The Free Trade Party recognised that the issue of tariffs had been settled and that the main issue was the Labour resurgence. Before the 1906 federal election, held in December, it changed its name to the Anti-Socialist Party. At the election, the Protectionists, whose protectionist policies were by then redundant, won only 16 seats to Labour&#x27;s 26, but Labour still led by Watson continued to support Deakin who formed the well known third Deakin Protectionist government.

Labour now under Andrew Fisher withdrew its support of the Deakin government on 13 November 1908 and formed a minority government. The Fisher government passed a large number of its legislation. A scandalised establishment, believing an anti-socialist alliance was necessary to counter Labor&#x27;s growing electoral dominance, pressured Deakin and Anti-Socialist Party&#x27;s new leader, Joseph Cook, to begin merger talks. The more liberal Protectionists opposed a merger. The party wound up splitting as a result. The main body, including Deakin and his supporters, merged with the Anti-Socialist Party in May 1909 to become the Commonwealth Liberal Party (CLP), popularly known as &quot;the Fusion Party&quot;, with Deakin as leader and Cook as deputy leader. The more liberal Protectionists defected to Labour. Deakin and the new CLP now held a majority on the floor of the House of Representatives and the Fisher government fell in a vote on 27 May 1909. Fisher failed to persuade the Governor-General Lord Dudley to dissolve Parliament. The Deakin CLP government was in power for less than a year until the 1910 election, where Labour under Fisher formed Australia&#x27;s first elected federal majority government, and the first elected Senate majority, winning 42 of the 75 seats in the House of Representatives to the Liberal&#x27;s 31. Deakin retired from Parliament in April 1913 and Cook took over the Liberal leadership before the calling of the 1913 election. The Liberals under Cook won government in 1913 by a single seat, however, Labor retained a Senate majority. Cook called a double dissolution, the first time one would be called. When the Senate rejected a bill twice, Cook called the 1914 election. The election had been called before the declaration of war in August 1914, and the campaign was conducted with the caretaker government going onto a war footing. At the election, the Liberals were soundly defeated with another Labor majority in both houses.

While the party itself disappeared into history, many of its key legislative initiatives, such as the White Australia policy and tariff protection for industry, were maintained by successive Australian governments for a large part of the 20th century. However, Labor could also take credit or be blamed (as the case may be) as many of the bills were passed during the Protectionist-Labour minority governments as part of Labour&#x27;s agreement for supporting a Protectionist government.

<doc id="328709" wikidata="Q756311" url="?curid=328709" title="Darwin's finches">
<text>Darwin&#x27;s finches (also known as the Galápagos finches) are a group of about 18 species of passerine birds. They are well known for being a classic example of adaptive radiation and for their remarkable diversity in beak form and function. They are often classified as the subfamily Geospizinae or tribe Geospizini. They belong to the tanager family and are not closely related to the true finches. The closest known relative of the Galápagos finches is the South American dull-coloured grassquit (&quot;Asemospiza obscura&quot;). They were first collected when the second voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot; visited the Galápagos Islands, with Charles Darwin on board as a gentleman naturalist. Apart from the Cocos finch, which is from Cocos Island, the others are found only on the Galápagos Islands.

The term &quot;Darwin&#x27;s finches&quot; was first applied by Percy Lowe in 1936, and popularised in 1947 by David Lack in his book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Finches&quot;. Lack based his analysis on the large collection of museum specimens collected by the 1905–06 Galápagos expedition of the California Academy of Sciences, to whom Lack dedicated his 1947 book. The birds vary in size from and weigh between . The smallest are the warbler-finches and the largest is the vegetarian finch. The most important differences between species are in the size and shape of their beaks, which are highly adapted to different food sources. Food availability was different among the islands of the Galapagos and could also change dramatically due to natural events such as droughts. The birds are all dull-coloured. They are thought to have evolved from a single finch species that came to the islands more than a million years ago.

== Darwin&#x27;s theory ==
During the survey voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;, Darwin was unaware of the significance of the birds of the Galápagos. He had learned how to preserve bird specimens from John Edmonstone while at the University of Edinburgh and had been keen on shooting, but he had no expertise in ornithology and by this stage of the voyage concentrated mainly on geology. In Galápagos he mostly left bird shooting to his servant Syms Covington. Nonetheless, these birds were to play an important part in the inception of Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection.

On the Galápagos Islands and afterward, Darwin thought in terms of &quot;centres of creation&quot; and rejected ideas concerning the transmutation of species. From Henslow&#x27;s teaching, he was interested in the geographical distribution of species, particularly links between species on oceanic islands and on nearby continents. On Chatham Island, he recorded that a mockingbird was similar to those he had seen in Chile, and after finding a different one on Charles Island he carefully noted where mockingbirds had been caught. In contrast, he paid little attention to the finches. When examining his specimens on the way to Tahiti, Darwin noted that all of the mockingbirds on Charles Island were of one species, those from Albemarle of another, and those from James and Chatham Islands of a third. As they sailed home about nine months later, this, together with other facts, including what he had heard about Galápagos tortoises, made him wonder about the stability of species.

Following his return from the voyage Darwin presented the finches to the Zoological Society of London on 4 January 1837, along with other mammal and bird specimens that he had collected. The bird specimens, including the finches, were given to John Gould, the famous English ornithologist, for identification. Gould set aside his paying work and at the next meeting, on 10 January, reported that the birds from the Galápagos Islands that Darwin had thought were blackbirds, &quot;gross-beaks&quot; and finches were actually &quot;a series of ground Finches which are so peculiar [as to form] an entirely new group, containing 12 species.&quot; This story made the newspapers.

Darwin had been in Cambridge at that time. In early March, he met Gould again and for the first time to get a full report on the findings, including the point that his Galápagos &quot;wren&quot; was another closely allied species of finch. The mockingbirds that Darwin had labelled by island were separate species rather than just varieties. Gould found more species than Darwin had expected, and concluded that 25 of the 26 land birds were new and distinct forms, found nowhere else in the world but closely allied to those found on the South American continent. Darwin now saw that, if the finch species were confined to individual islands, like the mockingbirds, this would help to account for the number of species on the islands, and he sought information from others on the expedition. Specimens had also been collected by Captain Robert FitzRoy, FitzRoy&#x27;s steward Harry Fuller, and Darwin&#x27;s servant Covington, who had labelled them by island. From these, Darwin tried to reconstruct the locations from where he had collected his own specimens. The conclusions supported his idea of the transmutation of species.

=== Text from &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot; ===
At the time that he rewrote his diary for publication as &quot;Journal and Remarks&quot; (later &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;), he described Gould&#x27;s findings on the number of birds, noting that &quot;Although the species are thus peculiar to the archipelago, yet nearly all in their general structure, habits, colour of feathers, and even tone of voice, are strictly American&quot;. In the first edition of &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot;, Darwin said thatIt is very remarkable that a nearly perfect gradation of structure in this one group can be traced in the form of the beak, from one exceeding in dimensions that of the largest gros-beak, to another differing but little from that of a warbler&quot;.

By the time the first edition was published, the development of Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection was in progress. For the 1845 second edition of &quot;The Voyage&quot; (now titled &quot;Journal of Researches&quot;), Darwin added more detail about the beaks of the birds, and two closing sentences which reflected his changed ideas:Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.&quot;

=== Text from &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; ===
Darwin discussed the divergence of various species of birds in the Galápagos more explicitly in his chapter on geographical distribution in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;; however, he does not single out the finches:

== Polymorphism in Darwin&#x27;s finches ==
Whereas Darwin spent just five weeks in the Galápagos, and David Lack spent three months, Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have made research trips to the Galápagos for about 30 years, particularly studying Darwin&#x27;s finches.

Females are dimorphic in song type: songs A and B are quite distinct. Also, males with song A have shorter bills than B males, another clear difference. With these beaks, males are able to feed differently on their favourite cactus, the prickly pear &quot;Opuntia&quot;. Those with long beaks are able to punch holes in the cactus fruit and eat the fleshy aril pulp, which surrounds the seeds, whereas those with shorter beaks tear apart the cactus base and eat the pulp and any insect larvae and pupae (both groups eat flowers and buds). This dimorphism clearly maximises their feeding opportunities during the non-breeding season when food is scarce.

If the population is panmictic, then &quot;Geospiza conirostris&quot; exhibits a balanced genetic polymorphism and not, as originally supposed, a case of nascent sympatric speciation. The selection maintaining the polymorphism maximises the species&#x27; niche by expanding its feeding opportunity. The genetics of this situation cannot be clarified in the absence of a detailed breeding program, but two loci with linkage disequilibrium is a possibility.

Another interesting dimorphism is for the bills of young finches, which are either &#x27;pink&#x27; or &#x27;yellow&#x27;. All species of Darwin&#x27;s finches exhibit this morphism, which lasts for two months. No interpretation of this phenomenon is known.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Family ===
For some decades, taxonomists have placed these birds in the family Emberizidae along with the New World sparrows and Old World buntings. However, the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy puts Darwin&#x27;s finches with the tanagers (Monroe and Sibley 1993), and at least one recent work follows that example (Burns and Skutch 2003). The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, in its North American checklist, places the Cocos finch in the Emberizidae, but with an asterisk indicating that the placement is probably wrong (AOU 1998–2006); in its tentative South American check-list, the Galápagos species are &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, of uncertain place (Remsen et al. 2007).

=== Species ===
* Genus &quot;Geospiza&quot;
** Genovesa ground finch (&quot;Geospiza acutirostris&quot;)
** Española cactus finch (&quot;Geospiza conirostris&quot;)
** Sharp-beaked ground finch (&quot;Geospiza difficilis&quot;)
** Vampire finch (&quot;Geospiza septentrionalis&quot;)
** Medium ground finch (&quot;Geospiza fortis&quot;)

** Large ground finch (&quot;Geospiza magnirostris&quot;)
** Common cactus finch (&quot;Geospiza scandens&quot;)
** Big Bird (not yet formally named): In 1981, a hybrid male arrived at Daphne Major island. Its mating with local Galapagos finches (specifically &quot;G. fortis&quot;) has produced a new &quot;big bird&quot; population that can exploit previously unexploited food due to its larger size. They do not breed with the other species on the island, as the females do not recognize the songs of the new males. Genetic evidence shows that currently, after several generations (a time scale that suggests shorter speciation events could have occurred previously), it lives in a complete reproductive isolation from the native species. According to professor Leif Andersson of Uppsala University, a taxonomist not aware of its history would consider it a distinct species.
* Genus &quot;Camarhynchus&quot;
** Large tree finch (&quot;Camarhynchus psittacula&quot;)
** Medium tree finch (&quot;Camarhynchus pauper&quot;)
** Small tree finch (&quot;Camarhynchus parvulus&quot;)

== Modern research ==
A long-term study carried out for more than 40 years by the Princeton University researchers Peter and Rosemary Grant has documented evolutionary changes in beak size affected by El Niño/La Niña cycles in the Pacific.

=== Molecular basis of beak evolution ===
Developmental research in 2004 found that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and its differential expression during development, resulted in variation of beak size and shape among finches. BMP4 acts in the developing embryo to lay down skeletal features, including making the beak stronger. The same group showed that the development of the different beak shapes in Darwin&#x27;s finches are also influenced by slightly different timing and spatial expressions of a gene called calmodulin (CaM). Calmodulin acts in a similar way to BMP4, affecting some of the features of beak growth like making them long and pointy. The authors suggest that changes in the temporal and spatial expression of these two factors are possible developmental controls of beak morphology. In a recent study genome sequencing revealed a 240 kilobase haplotype encompassing the ALX1 gene that encodes a transcription factor affecting craniofacial development is strongly associated with beak shape diversity. Moreover, these changes in the beak size have also altered vocalizations in Darwin&#x27;s finches.

Further research from 2016, in which genomes from each of the Darwin&#x27;s finch species were sequenced, established that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the high mobility AT-hook 2 gene (&quot;HMGA2&quot;) locus is significantly associated with variation in beak size (Lamichhaney et al. 2016). &quot;HMGA2&quot; codes for a transcription factor which in humans has been associated with variation in height, craniofacial distances, and primary tooth eruption.

In an analysis of the genomes of individuals from three &quot;Geospiza&quot; ground finch species found in sympatry (&quot;G. fortis&quot;, &quot;G. fuliginosa&quot;, &quot;G. magnirostris&quot;), 11 out of 32,569 SNPs were identified as representing four independent groups of statistically linked SNPs that together explained 83.6% of the variance in beak size (Chaves 2016). What this means is that only a small fraction of the genome in Darwin&#x27;s finches is responsible for variation in beak morphology which is consistent with the rapid changes in beak form in response to the varying environments on the Galapagos Islands.

<doc id="328721" wikidata="Q339686" url="?curid=328721" title="Tierra (computer simulation)">
<text>Tierra is a computer simulation developed by ecologist Thomas S. Ray in the early 1990s in which computer programs compete for time (central processing unit (CPU) time) and space (access to main memory). In this context, the computer programs in Tierra are considered to be evolvable and can mutate, self-replicate and recombine. Tierra&#x27;s virtual machine is written in C. It operates on a custom instruction set designed to facilitate code changes and reordering, including features such as jump to template (as opposed to the relative or absolute jumps common to most instruction sets).

== Simulations ==
The basic Tierra model has been used to experimentally explore &quot;in silico&quot; the basic processes of evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Processes such as the dynamics of punctuated equilibrium, host-parasite co-evolution and density-dependent natural selection are amenable to investigation within the Tierra framework. A notable difference between Tierra and more conventional models of evolutionary computation, such as genetic algorithms, is that there is no explicit, or exogenous fitness function built into the model. Often in such models there is the notion of a function being &quot;optimized&quot;; in the case of Tierra, the fitness function is endogenous: there is simply survival and death.

According to Thomas S. Ray and others, this may allow for more &quot;open-ended&quot; evolution, in which the dynamics of the feedback between evolutionary and ecological processes can itself change over time (see evolvability), although this claim has not been realized – like other digital evolution systems, it eventually reaches a point where novelty ceases to be created, and the system at large begins either looping or ceases to &#x27;evolve&#x27;. The issue of how true open-ended evolution can be implemented in an artificial system is still an open question in the field of artificial life.

Mark Bedau and Norman Packard developed a statistical method of classifying evolutionary systems and in 1997, Bedau &quot;et al.&quot; applied these statistics to Evita, an Artificial life model similar to Tierra and Avida, but with limited organism interaction and no parasitism, and concluded that Tierra-like systems do not exhibit the open-ended evolutionary signatures of naturally evolving systems.

Russell K. Standish has measured the informational complexity of Tierran &#x27;organisms&#x27;, and has similarly not observed complexity growth in Tierran evolution.

Tierra is an abstract model, but any quantitative model is still subject to the same validation and verification techniques applied to more traditional mathematical models, and as such, has no special status. The creation of more detailed models in which more realistic dynamics of biological systems and organisms are incorporated is now an active research field (see systems biology).

<text>The ABC islands is the physical group of [[ABC islands (Leeward Antilles)|A]]ruba, [[ABC islands (Leeward Antilles)|B]]onaire, and [[ABC islands (Leeward Antilles)|C]]uraçao, the three westernmost islands of the Leeward Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. These islands have a shared political history and a status of Dutch underlying ownership, since the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 ceded them back to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, as Curaçao and Dependencies from 1815. They are a short distance north of the Falcón State, Venezuela. Aruba and Curaçao are autonomous, self governing constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while Bonaire is a special municipality of the Netherlands. Territories of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the countries, and its special municipalities, are outside the European Union; citizens have Dutch nationality and the former colonial power benefits from preferential trade, mineral and natural resource rights, particularly offshore.

== History ==
Arawakan people such as the Caquetio are indigenous to the ABC islands. According to the disputed letters of Amerigo Vespucci, the first European to explore the ABC islands was one of Christopher Columbus&#x27; captains, Alonso de Ojeda, who landed on Curaçao in 1499. He is said to have called the islands &quot;Las islas de los Gigantes&quot; or &quot;Islands of the Giants&quot; due to the native inhabitants, the Caiquetio Indians. The first known European exploration was by Amerigo Vespucci, whose cartographer Juan de la Cosa first described the islands. By 1527 the Spanish had formed a government and established Catholicism on the islands.

In 1634, the Netherlands fought Spain over control of the islands. The Dutch won, (although Spain won them back before abandoning them due to them being of little value to the Spanish) and the islands were then administered by the Netherlands. The Dutch West India Company established a major port on Curaçao and began importing West-African slaves to the island and to nearby Bonaire. On Aruba however, slavery was not as widespread due to island being considered too dry by the Dutch and Spanish for large plantations.

The abolition of the slave trade in 1863 had a devastating impact on the plantation-driven economies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The ABC islands gained newfound economic importance when oil was discovered in Venezuela during the early 20th century, the islands became sites of major oil refineries. Oil refining on the islands aided heavily in the allied war effort during WWII.

From 1815 until 1954 the three islands were known as the Colony of Curaçao and Dependencies. This colony at various times also included Netherlands Suriname and Sint Eustatius and Dependencies. In 1954, the ABC islands were grouped together and became part of the Netherlands Antilles, which gave the islands political autonomy within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Although within The Netherlands Antilles, political power was largely dominated and held by Curaçao.

In 1986, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles after a 30 year political battle for separation, becoming a separate country within the kingdom. Upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010, Curaçao gained a similar status to Aruba. Bonaire became a special municipality of the Netherlands proper, although it maintains its status of an overseas territory of the European Union.

==Geography and climate==

The ABC islands are part of the Leeward Antilles, which is the westernmost area of the Lesser Antilles. They lie immediately to the north of Falcón State, Venezuela. Due to their political history, they are sometimes considered to be part of North America along with the other Caribbean islands, but are on South America&#x27;s geographical plate and continental shelf as with Trinidad and Tobago.

ABC does not indicate the geographical order to each other; from west to east the islands are Aruba, Curaçao, and Bonaire. Aruba is a flat island, much coastal land being exposed to tidal storm surges. Bonaire and Curaçao are surrounded by reefs, and so are much more sheltered from this. Bonaire&#x27;s and Curaçao&#x27;s reefs are popular tourist destinations.

The ABC islands have an atypical hot desert climate seen in hot pockets of Australia, Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot; and &quot;BWk&quot;, with some notable rain but an excess of evaporation over precipitation. Surfaces on these islands hold little moisture and evaporate the little rainfall they receive. In addition, Aruba–Curaçao–Bonaire cactus scrub is the most common vegetation on these islands. Furthermore, the ABC islands are very dry as they lie north of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Only in their short rainy season from October to December or January are they exposed to showers or storms formed from the northeast trade winds. The rainy season is powerfully influenced by the Southern Oscillation resulting in very high variability. During strong El Niño years like 1911/1912, 1930/1931, 1982/1983, and 1997/1998, annual (fiscal year) rainfall can be less than , and even under in Curação in 1911/1912. As much as fell during strong La Niña northern hemisphere winters: 1933/1934, 1970/1971, 1988/1989, 1999/2000, 2010/2011, and 2020/2021, with the highest monthly totals being over .

Temperatures in the ABC islands are uniformly hot, averaging around year-round, with comfortable humidity and minima rarely falling below even on the mildest mornings, although afternoons rarely top .

=== Environment ===
Bonaire is known for being a &quot;diving paradise&quot;, with ecotourism playing a large part in its economy. The islands have a huge variety of wildlife, including flamingoes and four species of sea turtle.

Aruba set aside 20% of its land for a National Park to protect and conserve its wildlife, known as Arikok National Park. The island is widely known for its beaches and low amounts of rainfall (even less rainfall than Curaçao and Bonaire).

== Demographics ==
Black people (African-descended) make up the majorities of Curaçao and Bonaire&#x27;s populations while Mestizos and White people make up the majority of Aruba&#x27;s population. There has been substantial immigration from South-America, the Caribbean and Europe to the islands, and to a lesser extent from North-America over the centuries. Historically the islands have been home to many nationalities, ethnic groups and cultures.

=== Language ===
Dutch has been the official language of the islands for most of their history since European contact, it is the language of education and government. However Dutch is not the common language on any of the ABC Islands.

Papiamentu (Papiamento on Aruba), a Portuguese creole language, is the most spoken language on all the islands. There are 2 main dialects of the language, Papiamentu (Curaçao, Bonaire) and Papiamento (Aruba). Unlike many other creole languages, Papiamento/u has and is not decreasing in usage. It has been made an official language on Aruba since 2003 and later official on in Curaçao and Bonaire since 2007. Papiamentu is heavily influenced by Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, English, German, French, and Italian.

Spanish and English are also widely known and spoken on the islands. Spanish due to historical ties and proximity to Latin-America and English due to North-American tourism. Other languages brought over by immigrants are also spoken in smaller communities on the islands.

== Politics ==
Aruba and Curaçao are autonomous countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which have their own parliament and prime minister. Bonaire is a &quot;special municipality&quot; of the Netherlands proper, and subject to Netherlands law.

Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao are constitutional parts of the European Union, meaning that all three islands are special member state territories. Citizens of these islands hold European passport and can vote on European parliament elections. In addition, the islands get European development funds and students on the islands can also apply for Erasmus program from the islands. However, the islands are not in the Schengen area of the European Union.

<text>Archaeogenetics is the study of ancient DNA using various molecular genetic methods and DNA resources. This form of genetic analysis can be applied to human, animal, and plant specimens. Ancient DNA can be extracted from various fossilized specimens including bones, eggshells, and artificially preserved tissues in human and animal specimens. In plants, ancient DNA can be extracted from seeds and tissue. Archaeogenetics provides us with genetic evidence of ancient population group migrations, domestication events, and plant and animal evolution. The ancient DNA cross referenced with the DNA of relative modern genetic populations allows researchers to run comparison studies that provide a more complete analysis when ancient DNA is compromised.

Archaeogenetics receives its name from the Greek word &quot;arkhaios&quot;, meaning &quot;ancient&quot;, and the term &quot;genetics&quot;, meaning &quot;the study of heredity&quot;. The term archaeogenetics was conceived by archaeologist Colin Renfrew.

In February 2021, scientists reported the oldest DNA ever sequenced was successfully retrieved from a mammoth dating back over a million years.

== Early work ==

=== Ludwik Hirszfeld (1884–1954) ===
Ludwik Hirszfeld was a Polish microbiologist and serologist who was the President of the Blood Group Section of the Second International Congress of Blood Transfusion. He founded blood group inheritance with Erich von Dungern in 1910, and contributed to it greatly throughout his life. He studied ABO blood groups. In one of his studies in 1919, Hirszfeld documented the ABO blood groups and hair color of people at the Macedonian front, leading to his discovery that the hair color and blood type had no correlation. In addition to that he observed that there was a decrease of blood group A from western Europe to India and the opposite for blood group B. He hypothesized that the east-to-west blood group ratio stemmed from two blood groups consisting of mainly A or B mutating from blood group O, and mixing through migration or intermingling. A majority of his work was researching the links of blood types to sex, disease, climate, age, social class, and race. His work led him to discover that peptic ulcer was more dominant in blood group O, and that AB blood type mothers had a high male-to-female birth ratio.

=== Arthur Mourant (1904–1994) ===
Arthur Mourant was a British hematologist and chemist. He received many awards, most notably Fellowship of the Royal Society. His work included organizing the existing data on blood group gene frequencies, and largely contributing to the genetic map of the world through his investigation of blood groups in many populations. Mourant discovered the new blood group antigens of the Lewis, Henshaw, Kell, and Rhesus systems, and analyzed the association of blood groups and various other diseases. He also focused on the biological significance of polymorphisms. His work provided the foundation for archaeogenetics because it facilitated the separation of genetic evidence for biological relationships between people. This genetic evidence was previously used for that purpose. It also provided material that could be used to appraise the theories of population genetics.

=== William Boyd (1903–1983) ===
William Boyd was an American immunochemist and biochemist who became famous for his research on the genetics of race in the 1950s. During the 1940s, Boyd and Karl O. Renkonen independently discovered that lectins react differently to various blood types, after finding that the crude extracts of the lima bean and tufted vetch agglutinated the red blood cells from blood type A but not blood types B or O. This ultimately led to the disclosure of thousands of plants that contained these proteins. In order to examine racial differences and the distribution and migration patterns of various racial groups, Boyd systematically collected and classified blood samples from around the world, leading to his discovery that blood groups are not influenced by the environment, and are inherited. In his book &quot;Genetics and the Races of Man&quot; (1950), Boyd categorized the world population into 13 distinct races, based on their different blood type profiles and his idea that human races are populations with differing alleles. One of the most abundant information sources regarding inheritable traits linked to race remains the study of blood groups.

=== Fossil DNA preservation ===
Fossil retrieval starts with selecting an excavation site. Potential excavation sites are usually identified with the mineralogy of the location and visual detection of bones in the area. However, there are more ways to discover excavation zones using technology such as field portable x-ray fluorescence and Dense Stereo Reconstruction. Tools used include knives, brushes, and pointed trowels which assist in the removal of fossils from the earth.

To avoid contaminating the ancient DNA, specimens are handled with gloves and stored in -20 °C immediately after being unearthed. Ensuring that the fossil sample is analyzed in a lab that has not been used for other DNA analysis could prevent contamination as well. Bones are milled to a powder and treated with a solution before the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. Samples for DNA amplification may not necessarily be fossil bones. Preserved skin, salt-preserved or air-dried, can also be used in certain situations.

DNA preservation is difficult because the bone fossilisation degrades and DNA is chemically modified, usually by bacteria and fungi in the soil. The best time to extract DNA from a fossil is when it is freshly out of the ground as it contains six times the DNA when compared to stored bones. The temperature of extraction site also affects the amount of obtainable DNA, evident by a decrease in success rate for DNA amplification if the fossil is found in warmer regions. A drastic change of a fossil&#x27;s environment also affects DNA preservation. Since excavation causes an abrupt change in the fossil&#x27;s environment, it may lead to physiochemical change in the DNA molecule. Moreover, DNA preservation is also affected by other factors such as the treatment of the unearthed fossil like (e.g. washing, brushing and sun drying), pH, irradiation, the chemical composition of bone and soil, and hydrology. There are three perseveration diagenetic phases. The first phase is bacterial putrefaction, which is estimated to cause a 15-fold degradation of DNA. Phase 2 is when bone chemically degrades, mostly by depurination. The third diagenetic phase occurs after the fossil is excavated and stored, in which bone DNA degradation occurs most rapidly.

===Methods of DNA extraction===
Once a specimen is collected from an archaeological site, DNA can be extracted through a series of processes. One of the more common methods utilizes silica and takes advantage of polymerase chain reactions in order to collect ancient DNA from bone samples.

There are several challenges that add to the difficulty when attempting to extract ancient DNA from fossils and prepare it for analysis. DNA is continuously being split up. While the organism is alive these splits are repaired; however, once an organism has died, the DNA will begin to deteriorate without repair. This results in samples having strands of DNA measuring around 100 base pairs in length. Contamination is another significant challenge at multiple steps throughout the process. Often other DNA, such as bacterial DNA, will be present in the original sample. To avoid contamination it is necessary to take many precautions such as separate ventilation systems and workspaces for ancient DNA extraction work. The best samples to use are fresh fossils as uncareful washing can lead to mold growth. DNA coming from fossils also occasionally contains a compound that inhibits DNA replication. Coming to a consensus on which methods are best at mitigating challenges is also difficult due to the lack of repeatability caused by the uniqueness of specimens.

Silica-based DNA extraction is a method used as a purification step to extract DNA from archaeological bone artifacts and yield DNA that can be amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. This process works by using silica as a means to bind DNA and separate it from other components of the fossil process that inhibit PCR amplification. However, silica itself is also a strong PCR inhibitor, so careful measures must be taken to ensure that silica is removed from the DNA after extraction. The general process for extracting DNA using the silica-based method is outlined by the following:
# Bone specimen is cleaned and the outer layer is scraped off
# Sample is collected from preferably compact section
# Sample is ground to fine powder and added to an extraction solution to release DNA
# Silica solution is added and centrifuged to facilitate DNA binding
# Binding solution is removed and a buffer is added to the solution to release the DNA from the silica
One of the main advantages of silica-based DNA extraction is that it is relatively quick and efficient, requiring only a basic laboratory setup and chemicals. It is also independent of sample size, as the process can be scaled to accommodate larger or smaller quantities. Another benefit is that the process can be executed at room temperature. However, this method does contain some drawbacks. Mainly, silica-based DNA extraction can only be applied to bone and teeth samples; they cannot be used on soft tissue. While they work well with a variety of different fossils, they may be less effective in fossils that are not fresh (e.g. treated fossils for museums). Also, contamination poses a risk for all DNA replication in general, and this method may result in misleading results if applied to contaminated material.

Polymerase chain reaction is a process that can amplify segments of DNA and is often used on extracted ancient DNA. It has three main steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension. Denaturation splits the DNA into two single strands at high temperatures. Annealing involves attaching primer strands of DNA to the single strands that allow Taq polymerase to attach to the DNA. Extension occurs when Taq polymerase is added to the sample and matches base pairs to turn the two single strands into two complete double strands. This process is repeated many times, and is usually repeated a higher number of times when used with ancient DNA. Some issues with PCR is that it requires overlapping primer pairs for ancient DNA due to the short sequences. There can also be “jumping PCR” which causes recombination during the PCR process which can make analyzing the DNA more difficult in inhomogeneous samples.

===Methods of DNA analysis===
DNA extracted from fossil remains is primarily sequenced using Massive parallel sequencing, which allows simultaneous amplification and sequencing of all DNA segments in a sample, even when it is highly fragmented and of low concentration. It involves attaching a generic sequence to every single strand that generic primers can bond to, and thus all of the DNA present is amplified. This is generally more costly and time intensive than PCR but due to the difficulties involved in ancient DNA amplification it is cheaper and more efficient. One method of massive parallel sequencing, developed by Margulies et al., employs bead-based emulsion PCR and pyrosequencing, and was found to be powerful in analyses of aDNA because it avoids potential loss of sample, substrate competition for templates, and error propagation in replication.

The most common way to analyze an aDNA sequence is to compare it with a known sequence from other sources, and this could be done in different ways for different purposes.

The identity of the fossil remain can be uncovered by comparing its DNA sequence with those of known species using software such as BLASTN. This archaeogenetic approach is especially helpful when the morphology of the fossil is ambiguous. Apart from that, species identification can also be done by finding specific genetic markers in an aDNA sequence. For example, the American indigenous population is characterized by specific mitochondrial RFLPs and deletions defined by Wallace et al.

aDNA comparison study can also reveal the evolutionary relationship between two species. The number of base differences between DNA of an ancient species and that of a closely related extant species can be used to estimate the divergence time of those two species from their last common ancestor. The phylogeny of some extinct species, such as Australian marsupial wolves and American ground sloths, has been constructed by this method. Mitochondrial DNA in animals and chloroplast DNA in plants are usually used for this purpose because they have hundreds of copies per cell and thus are more easily accessible in ancient fossils.

Another method to investigate relationship between two species is through DNA hybridization. Single-stranded DNA segments of both species are allowed to form complementary pair bonding with each other. More closely related species have a more similar genetic makeup, and thus a stronger hybridization signal. Scholz et al. conducted southern blot hybridization on Neanderthal aDNA (extracted from fossil remain W-NW and Krapina). The results showed weak ancient human-Neanderthal hybridization and strong ancient human-modern human hybridization. The human-chimpanzee and neanderthal-chimpanzee hybridization are of similarly weak strength. This suggests that humans and neanderthals are not as closely related as two individuals of the same species are, but they are more related to each other than to chimpanzees.

There have also been some attempts to decipher aDNA to provide valuable phenotypic information of ancient species. This is always done by mapping aDNA sequence onto the karyotype of a well-studied closely related species, which share a lot of similar phenotypic traits. For example, Green et al. compared the aDNA sequence from Neanderthal Vi-80 fossil with modern human X and Y chromosome sequence, and they found a similarity in 2.18 and 1.62 bases per 10,000 respectively, suggesting Vi-80 sample was from a male individual. Other similar studies include finding of a mutation associated with dwarfism in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; in ancient Nubian cotton, and investigation on the bitter taste perception locus in Neanderthals.

==== Africa ====
Modern humans are thought to have evolved in Africa at least 200 kya (thousand years ago), with some evidence suggesting a date of over 300 kya. Examination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome DNA, and X-chromosome DNA indicate that the earliest population to leave Africa consisted of approximately 1500 males and females. It has been suggested by various studies that populations were geographically “structured” to some degree prior to the expansion out of Africa; this is suggested by the antiquity of shared mtDNA lineages. One study of 121 populations from various places throughout the continent found 14 genetic and linguistic “clusters,” suggesting an ancient geographic structure to African populations. In general, genotypic and phenotypic analysis have shown “large and subdivided throughout much of their evolutionary history.”

Genetic analysis has supported archaeological hypotheses of a large-scale migrations of Bantu speakers into Southern Africa approximately 5 kya. Microsatellite DNA, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (INDELS) have shown that Nilo-Saharan speaking populations originate from Sudan. Furthermore, there is genetic evidence that Chad-speaking descendants of Nilo-Saharan speakers migrated from Sudan to Lake Chad about 8 kya. Genetic evidence has also indicated that non-African populations made significant contributions to the African gene pool. For example, the Saharan African Beja people have high levels of Middle-Eastern as well as East African Cushitic DNA.

==== Europe ====

Analysis of mtDNA shows that modern humans occupied Eurasia in a single migratory event between 60 and 70 kya. Genetic evidence shows that occupation of the Near East and Europe happened no earlier than 50 kya. Studying haplogroup U has shown separate dispersals from the Near East both into Europe and into North Africa.

Much of the work done in archaeogenetics focuses on the Neolithic transition in Europe. Cavalli-Svorza&#x27;s analysis of genetic-geographic patterns led him to conclude that there was a massive influx of Near Eastern populations into Europe at the start of the Neolithic. This view led him “to strongly emphasize the expanding early farmers at the expense of the indigenous Mesolithic foraging populations.” mtDNA analysis in the 1990s, however, contradicted this view. M.B. Richards estimated that 10–22% of extant European mtDNA&#x27;s had come from Near Eastern populations during the Neolithic. Most mtDNA&#x27;s were “already established” among existing Mesolithic and Paleolithic groups. Most “control-region lineages” of modern European mtDNA are traced to a founder event of reoccupying northern Europe towards the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). One study of extant European mtDNA&#x27;s suggest this reoccupation occurred after the end of the LGM, although another suggests it occurred before. Analysis of haplogroups V, H, and U5 support a “pioneer colonization” model of European occupation, with incorporation of foraging populations into arriving Neolithic populations. Furthermore, analysis of ancient DNA, not just extant DNA, is shedding light on some issues. For instance, comparison of neolithic and mesolithic DNA has indicated that the development of dairying preceded widespread lactose tolerance.

==== South Asia ====
South Asia has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. Based on studies of mtDNA line M, some have suggested that the first occupants of India were Austro-Asiatic speakers who entered about 45–60 kya. The Indian gene pool has contributions from earliest settlers, as well as West Asian and Central Asian populations from migrations no earlier than 8 kya. The lack of variation in mtDNA lineages compared to the Y-chromosome lineages indicate that primarily males partook in these migrations. The discovery of two subbranches U2i and U2e of the U mtDNA lineage, which arose in Central Asia has “modulated” views of a large migration from Central Asia into India, as the two branches diverged 50 kya. Furthermore, U2e is found in large percentages in Europe but not India, and vice versa for U2i, implying U2i is native to India.

==== East Asia ====
Analysis of mtDNA and NRY (non-recombining region of Y chromosome) sequences have indicated that the first major dispersal out of Africa went through Saudi Arabia and the Indian coast 50–100 kya, and a second major dispersal occurred 15–50 kya north of the Himalayas.

Much work has been done to discover the extent of north-to-south and south-to-north migrations within Eastern Asia. Comparing the genetic diversity of northeastern groups with southeastern groups has allowed archaeologists to conclude many of the northeast Asian groups came from the southeast. The Pan-Asian SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) study found “a strong and highly significant correlation between haplotype diversity and latitude,” which, when coupled with demographic analysis, supports the case for a primarily south-to-north occupation of East Asia. Archaeogenetics has also been used to study hunter-gatherer populations in the region, such as the Ainu from Japan and Negrito groups in the Philippines. For example, the Pan-Asian SNP study found that Negrito populations in Malaysia and the Negrito populations in the Philippines were more closely related to non-Negrito local populations than to each other, suggesting Negrito and non-Negrito populations are linked by one entry event into East Asia; although other Negrito groups do share affinities, including with Indigenous Australians. A possible explanation of this is a recent admixture of some Negrito groups with their local populations.

==== Americas ====

Archaeogenetics has been used to better understand the populating of the Americas from Asia. Native American mtDNA haplogroups have been estimated to be between 15 and 20 kya, although there is some variation in these estimates. Genetic data has been used to propose various theories regarding how the Americas were colonized. Although the most widely held theory suggests “three waves” of migration after the LGM through the Bering Strait, genetic data have given rise to alternative hypotheses. For example, one hypothesis proposes a migration from Siberia to South America 20–15 kya and a second migration that occurred after glacial recession. Y-chromosome data has led some to hold that there was a single migration starting from the Altai Mountains of Siberia between 17.2 and 10.1 kya, after the LGM. Analysis of both mtDNA and Y-chromosome DNA reveals evidence of “small, founding populations.” Studying haplogroups has led some scientists to conclude that a southern migration into the Americas from one small population was impossible, although separate analysis has found that such a model is feasible if such a migration happened along the coasts.

==== Australia and New Guinea ====
Finally, archaeogenetics has been used to study the occupation of Australia and New Guinea. The Indigenous people of Australia and New Guinea are phenotypically very similar, but mtDNA has shown that this is due to convergence from living in similar conditions. Non-coding regions of mt-DNA have shown “no similarities” between the aboriginal populations of Australia and New Guinea. Furthermore, no major NRY lineages are shared between the two populations. The high frequency of a single NRY lineage unique to Australia coupled with “low diversity of lineage-associated Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR) haplotypes” provide evidence for a “recent founder or bottleneck” event in Australia. But there is relatively large variation in mtDNA, which would imply that the bottleneck effect impacted males primarily. Together, NRY and mtDNA studies show that the splitting event between the two groups was over 50 kya, casting doubt on recent common ancestry between the two.

=== Plants and animals ===
Archaeogenetics has been used to understand the development of domestication of plants and animals.

==== Domestication of plants ====
The combination of genetics and archeological findings have been used to trace the earliest signs of plant domestication around the world. However, since the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes used to trace domestication&#x27;s moment of origin have evolved at different rates, its use to trace genealogy have been somewhat problematic. Nuclear DNA in specific is used over mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA because of its faster mutation rate as well as its intraspecific variation due to a higher consistency of polymorphism genetic markers. Findings in crop &#x27;domestication genes&#x27; (traits that were specifically selected for or against) include
* tb1 (teosinte branched1) – affecting the apical dominance in maize
* tga1 (teosinte glume architecture1) – making maize kernels compatible for the convenience of humans 
* te1 (Terminal ear1) – affecting the weight of kernels
* fw2.2 – affecting the weight in tomatoes
* BoCal – inflorescence of broccoli and cauliflower
Through the study of archaeogenetics in plant domestication, signs of the first global economy can also be uncovered. The geographical distribution of new crops highly selected in one region found in another where it would have not originally been introduced serve as evidence of a trading network for the production and consumption of readily available resources.

==== Domestication of animals ====
Archaeogenetics has been used to study the domestication of animals. By analyzing genetic diversity in domesticated animal populations researchers can search for genetic markers in DNA to give valuable insight about possible traits of progenitor species. These traits are then used to help distinguish archaeological remains between wild and domesticated specimens. The genetic studies can also lead to the identification of ancestors for domesticated animals. The information gained from genetics studies on current populations helps guide the Archaeologist&#x27;s search for documenting these ancestors.

Archaeogenetics has been used to trace the domestication of pigs throughout the old world. These studies also reveal evidence about the details of early farmers. Methods of Archaeogenetics have also been used to further understand the development of domestication of dogs. Genetic studies have shown that all dogs are descendants from the gray wolf, however, it is currently unknown when, where, and how many times dogs were domesticated. Some genetic studies have indicated multiple domestications while others have not. Archaeological findings help better understand this complicated past by providing solid evidence about the progression of the domestication of dogs. As early humans domesticated dogs the archaeological remains of buried dogs became increasingly more abundant. Not only does this provide more opportunities for archaeologists to study the remains, it also provides clues about early human culture.

<text>Peter David Eisenman (born August 11, 1932) is an American architect, writer, and professor. Considered one of the New York Five, Eisenman is known for his high modernist and deconstructive designs, as well as for his authorship of several architectural books. His work has won him several awards, including the Wolf Prize in Arts.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Peter Eisenman was born to Jewish parents on August 11, 1932, in Newark, New Jersey. As a child, he attended Columbia High School located in Maplewood, New Jersey. He transferred into the architecture school as an undergraduate at Cornell University and gave up his position on the swimming team in order to commit full-time to his studies. He received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell, a Master of Architecture degree from Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, and MA and PhD degrees from the University of Cambridge. He received an honorary degree from Syracuse University School of Architecture in 2007.

===Career===
He first rose to prominence as a member of the New York Five (also known as &quot;the Whites&quot;), along with fellow architects Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk, Richard Meier, and Michael Graves. Some of their work was presented at a CASE Studies conference in 1969, catapulting their respective careers. Eisenman received a number of grants from the Graham Foundation for work done in this period. The New York Five began their careers by iterating on Le Corbusier&#x27;s distinctive style, but they all subsequently developed unique styles and ideologies, with Eisenman becoming more affiliated with Deconstructivism.
Eisenman currently teaches theory seminars and advanced design studios at the Yale School of Architecture, and is Professor Emeritus at the Cooper Union School of Architecture. Previously, he taught at the University of Cambridge, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University School of Architecture, and the Ohio State University. He founded the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in 1967 and served as its Executive Director until 1981.

His professional work is often referred to as formalist, deconstructive, late avant-garde, late and high modernist. The fragmenting of forms visible in some of his projects has been identified as characteristic of deconstructivism, and he has become one of the movement&#x27;s flagbearer. In 1988, he was featured in the &quot;Deconstructivists&quot; exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

While well known for his single-family residences, particularly his &quot;House&quot; series, he has also worked on several large-scale non-residential projects as well. Some examples include the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin and the new University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. His largest project to date is the City of Culture of Galicia in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. In his practice, Eisenman was an early advocate of computer-aided design, employing fledgling innovators such as Greg Lynn and Ingeborg Rocker as early as 1989.

His writings have pursued topics including comparative formal analyses; the emancipation and autonomization of architecture; and histories of Architects. Architects he has written about include Giuseppe Terragni, Andrea Palladio, Le Corbusier and James Stirling. Additionally, he is featured in wide print and many films, including the 2008 film &quot;Peter Eisenman: University of Phoenix Stadium for the Arizona Cardinals&quot; in which he provides a tour of his recent construction.

Eisenman has won several awards, including the National Design Award for Architecture in 2001, and the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2010.

== Criticism ==

Several criticisms have been waged against Eisenman over his designs, style, and perspective on the field of architecture. In 1972, Colin Rowe wrote that he pursued a physique form of European modernism rather than utopian social agendas. And, more recently, accusations have been made that Eisenman&#x27;s work is &quot;post-humanist&quot;. His apathy towards the recent &quot;green&quot; movement, too has been considered polarizing or &quot;out-of-touch&quot;. Despite these claims of polarity and divisiveness, Eisenman has famously pursued dialogues with important cultural figures internationally. These include his English mentor Colin Rowe, the Italian historian Manfredo Tafuri, George Baird, Fredric Jameson, Laurie Olin, Rosalind Krauss and Jacques Derrida.

Another point of criticism over his work has been the state of some of his deconstructivist buildings. The Wexner Center, the first major public deconstructivist building, has required extensive and expensive retrofitting due to major design flaws, such as incompetent material specifications, and fine art exhibition space exposed to direct sunlight. It was frequently repeated that the Wexner&#x27;s colliding planes tended to make its users disoriented to the point of physical nausea; in 1997 researcher Michael Pollan tracked the source of this rumor back to Eisenman himself. In architectural historian Andrew Ballantyne&#x27;s opinion, &quot;By some scale of values, he was actually enhancing the reputation of his building by letting it be known that it was hostile to humanity.&quot; Eisenman&#x27;s House VI, designed for clients Richard and Suzanne Frank in the mid-1970s, also required several costly fixes resulting in the couple turning against Eisenman.

<doc id="328744" wikidata="Q80847" url="?curid=328744" title="Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba">
<text>Fernando Álvarez de Toledo y Pimentel, 3rd Duke of Alba (29 October 150711 December 1582), known as the Grand Duke of Alba (, ) in Spain and Portugal and as the Iron Duke () or shortly &#x27;Alva&#x27; in the Netherlands, was a Spanish nobleman, general and statesman.

He has often been considered the most effective general of his generation, as well as one of the greatest in history. Historian John Lothrop Motley wrote of him &quot;no man had studied military science more deeply, or practiced it more constantly&quot; at his day. He was a royal promoter of military action against France and Protestantism, although he also defended a moral and strategic alliance with England that never realized. Alba achieved notoriety for his role during the Eighty Years&#x27; War in the Spanish Netherlands, where his prolonged campaigns and repressive political actions caused his figure to be reviled in European history as a symbol of tyranny.

Born into a prominent Castilian military family, Alba first distinguished himself in the 1535 conquest of Tunis during the Ottoman–Habsburg Wars as part of a long conflict for predominance over the western Mediterranean Sea. He then commanded the Spanish troops at the Battle of Mühlberg (1547), where the army of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V defeated the German Protestant princes in the Schmalkaldic War. Alba was the commander-in-chief of the Spanish-Habsburg army during the Italian War of 1551–1559, and became governor of Milan in 1555 and viceroy of Naples in 1556.

In 1567, King Philip II of Spain appointed Alba governor of the Netherlands and tasked him with the suppression of Dutch rebels. Alba instituted the Council of Troubles, which led to the condemnations of thousands and came to be known as the &quot;Council of Blood&quot;. Militarily, Alba repeatedly defeated the troops of William of Orange during the first stages of the Eighty Years&#x27; War but he failed to extinguish the rebellion, and in 1573 he was recalled to Spain in temporary political disgrace. Alba&#x27;s last military successes were in the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580, for which he was rewarded the titles viceroy and constable of Portugal. He held both titles until his death in Lisbon in 1582.

== Early years ==
Fernando was born in Piedrahíta, Province of Ávila, on 29 October 1507. He was the son of García Álvarez de Toledo y Zúñiga, heir of Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo y Enríquez de Quiñones, II Duke of Alba de Tormes, and of Beatriz Pimentel, daughter of Rodrigo Alonso Pimentel, IV Count – I Duke of Benavente and his wife, María Pacheco. Fernando was orphaned at age three when his father, García, died during a campaign on the island of Djerba in Africa in 1510. At the age of six, Fernando accompanied his grandfather, the second Duke of Alba, on a military mission to capture Navarre.

His youth and education were typical for Castilian nobility of the age. He was educated at the ducal court of the House of Alba, located in the Castle Palace of Alba de Tormes, by two Italian preceptors, Bernardo Gentilea Sicilian Benedictineand Severo Marini and by the Spanish Renaissance poet and writer Juan Boscan. He was educated in Roman Catholicism and humanism. He mastered Latin and knew French, English and German.

In 1524, when he was seventeen, he joined the troops of Constable of Castile, Íñigo Fernández de Velasco, II Duke of Frías, during the capture of Fuenterrabía, then occupied by France and Navarre. For his role in the siege, Fernando was appointed governor of Fuenterrabía.

When his grandfather Fadrique died in 1531, the ducal title passed to Fernando as the firstborn son of Garcia. Throughout his adulthood, he served the Spanish monarchs Charles I and his successor Philip II.

== Mayordomo mayor to the Spanish kings ==
In 1541 Fernando Álvarez de Toledo was named Mayordomo Mayor del Rey de España (High Steward to the King of Spain) by Charles I of Spain. Alba kept this office in court until the death of the monarch in 1556.

In 1546, Charles I invested the Duke of Alba Grand Master as knight of the Illustrious Order of the Golden Fleece.

From 1548 King Charles intensified the preparations of Prince Philip as his successor in the Spanish Monarchy, and he named Duke of Alba mayordomo mayor of his son to prepare Philip for his new role. Fernando took Philip on a tour around Europe that lasted until 1551. Fernando accompanied Philip to England to attend his marriage to Mary Tudor. The Duke was one of fifteen grandees of Spain who attended the ceremony in the abbey of Winchester on 25 July 1554.

After the death of Charles, the new King Philip II maintained Alba as mayordomo mayor until the death of the Duke in 1582.

In 1563, King Philip II created the title Duke of Huéscar to be bestowed on the heir of the Dukes of Alba. Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, son of Fernando became 1st Duke of Huéscar.

In 1566, Alba&#x27;s son and heir, Fadrique, broke his promise of marriage to Magdalena de Guzman, lady of Queen Anne of Austria, which led to his arrest and imprisonment in the Castle of La Mota in Valladolid. The following year he was released so he could go to Flanders with his father to serve in the military. In 1578 Philip II ordered the case against Fadrique reopened. It was discovered that in order to avoid marriage, Fadrique had secretly married María de Toledo, daughter of García Álvarez de Toledo and Osorio, IV Marquess of Villafranca del Bierzo, using a permit issued for that purpose by his father the Duke of Alba. Fadrique was sent to prison, in the Castle of La Mota. Fernando, Duke of Alba was banished from the court for one year for &quot;breaking the strict court protocol.&quot; The Duke went into exile in Uceda, where his secretaries Fernando de Albornoz and Esteban Ibarra likewise spent their punishment.

==Military commands==

=== Against the Ottomans and French (1532–42) ===
After Fernando had become the third Duke of Alba in 1532, Charles V sent him to Vienna to help defend the city against an Ottoman invasion army. No battle ensued as the Ottomans, having lost momentum due to time lost during the Siege of Güns, decided not to advance against Vienna and retreated from the field.

During this time, he was accompanied by the soldier-poet Garcilaso de la Vega throughout his travels in Europe. The special access that De La Vega had as a close companion to Alba, coupled with his skilled craft as a writer, allows the historian to delve into the deepest emotions expressed by the Duke of Alba through the poetry of De La Vega, specifically concerning the arduous travels while on a war-footing as well as the emotional longing that Alba expressed for his wife.

The Duke&#x27;s first military command to engage in battle was in the conquest of Tunis. In early June 1535 at Cagliari, he embarked with the military force commanded by the Marquess of Vasto. On 14 July, the fortress of La Goleta was seized, and a week later the army took the city of Tunis which was defended by Hayreddin Barbarossa. Thus Spain regained control over the western Mediterranean Sea.

In 1542, he led the Spanish troops against the French Army, ending the siege of Perpignan. The siege was a decisive victory for Alba and one of the worst defeats of Francis I during the French offensive of 1542.

=== In Germany (1546–47) ===
In 1547, Charles I, in his capacity as Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor engaged with the Protestant forces in the Schmalkaldic War. The Duke of Alba was in charge of Tercios, the elite Spanish ground troops during the Battle of Mühlberg on the banks of the river Elbe. A flanking attack by Alba&#x27;s Tercios was largely responsible for the imperial army&#x27;s decisive victory against the Elector of Saxony.

=== In Milan and Naples (1555–59) ===
In later years, the focus of conflict between France and Spain had moved to the Italian peninsula. Alba was sent to Italy as commander in chief of the Spanish-Habsburg army in Italy, and became governor of Milan in 1555, and viceroy of Naples in 1556.

The newly appointed Pope Paul IV, an enemy of the Habsburgs, prompted King Henry II of France to expel the Spanish from Italy. Papal troops joined the French for this aim. In July 1556 the Pope declared Philip II was removed from the title King of Naples. Alba did not hesitate and marched on Rome at the head of 12,000 Spanish soldiers. He financed the campaign, in part, by obtaining a loan of 430,000 ducats from Bona Sforza, dowager Queen of Poland; the loan became known as Neapolitan sums and was never repaid. The Pope called for a truce, giving time for a French army commanded by Francis, Duke of Guise to march on Naples. The Spanish intercepted the French and defeated them in the Battle of San Quentin. Without French support, the papal troops were overwhelmed by the Spanish and the Duke of Alba entered Rome in September 1557. The pope had to sue for peace.

In April 1559, Alba was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis which ended their war with France and released Spanish resources for maximising its economic exploitation of New Spain. The Italian peninsula entered a prolonged period of peace, sealed by marriage between the twice widowed Philip II and Isabel de Valois, daughter of Henry II of France. During the royal wedding, which was held in Paris, Alba acted as proxy for Philip.

=== Governor of the Netherlands (1567–73) ===

On 26 December 1566 Alba received the Golden Rose, the blessed sword and hat granted by Pope Pius V, through the papal brief &quot;Solent Romani Pontifices&quot;, in recognition of his singular efforts in favor of Catholicism and for being considered one of his champions.

From August to October 1566, the &quot;Iconoclasm&quot; () took place in the Netherlands, during which Calvinist mobs attacked and destroyed numerous Catholic monasteries and churches, ransacking tombs and destroying statues. To tackle the civil and religious rebels, King Philip II sent Alba to Brussels on 22 August 1567, at the head of a powerful army. Upon arrival, he replaced Margaret of Parma, the sister of the Spanish king, as head of the civil jurisdiction. He decided that the local nobility was in open rebellion against the king and supported the new Protestant teachings, heresy in the Catholic view.

A few days later, on 5 September 1567, Alba established the &quot;Council of Troubles&quot;, popularly known in the Netherlands as the &quot;Court of Blood,&quot; to prosecute those responsible for the riots of 1566, especially those deemed heretics. Alba also targeted the local Catholic nobles who favoured dialogue and who opposed outside intervention. Two of the three heads of Flemish nobility, the Count of Egmont, a Catholic General for Philip II, who had led the cavalry that defeated the French at the Battle of San Quentin, and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn, were arrested and the court sentenced both counts to death. The Mayor of Antwerp, Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem and Jan van Casembroot were other famous victims of the bloody repression, along with a large group of other apostates. Those condemned were executed on 5 June 1568 in the Town Hall Square in Brussels. Alba had little confidence in conventional Flemish justice, which he perceived as sympathetic to the defendants, and witnessed the executions in person. He would later become equally mistrustful of the local helpers of the Council of Troubles as possibly having their own agendas.

The maintenance of the troops in Flanders entailed substantial economic costs. The Duke imposed new taxes on the population and reformed its laws. Some cities, including Utrecht, refused to pay and declared a rebellion, which quickly spread throughout the Netherlands. William the Silent, the prince of Orange, enlisted the help of the French Huguenots and started to actively support the rebellion. William and the Huguenots took many Dutch cities. The Spanish troops advanced under banners with the Latin legend &quot;Pro lege, rege, et grege&quot;, which in English means &quot;For the law, the king, and the people&quot; [literally, &quot;the flock&quot;].
In 1572 the Spanish army carried out the Spanish Fury at Mechelen, retaking and sacking the city after the rebel garrison had left. From there, they retook Zutphen and Naarden. The Spanish Siege of Haarlem, characterized by brutality and savagery on both sides, culminated in the surrender of the city and the execution of all the garrison, estimated at 2,000 men. The subsequent Siege of Alkmaar was unsuccessful however: it was the first defeat in a full scale engagement for the Spanish troops during the Dutch revolt. The prolonged military campaigns and the harsh repression of the rebel citizenry earned the 3rd Duke of Alba the nickname &quot;The Iron Duke&quot; in the Netherlands, and he became an important element of the anti-Spanish Black Legend. His reputation was used for propaganda purposes by rebel statesman Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde to further strengthen anti-Spanish sentiments in the Netherlands.

In spite of continuous military action, the political situation in the Netherlands had not turned in favour of the Spanish crown. After five years of repression, more than 5,000 executions and numerous complaints to the Spanish court, Philip II decided to change policy and relieve the Duke. The monarch sent Luis de Requesens to replace him. De Requesens tried to appease the situation by giving concessions to the rebels. Alba returned to Spain in 1573.

Nevertheless, the Duke still had influence in the Royal Council. Alba belonged to the conservative Spanish faction called &quot;Albistas&quot; or imperialists. This faction included the Inquisitor General Fernando de Valdés y Salas, the House of Pimentel, the Duke de Alburquerque and other members of the House of Álvarez de Toledo. The Albistas advised the king to take a firm stand in the Netherlands. The Albistas&#x27; hardline position was hotly contested by the liberal &quot;Ebolistas&quot; or humanists, led by Ruy Gómez de Silva, prince of Éboli and his secretary Francisco de Eraso. After the death of the prince of Éboli in 1573, the royal secretary Antonio Pérez went on to lead the liberal faction and began his association with Ana de Mendoza de la Cerda, Princess of Éboli. Against the Albistas&#x27; urging, King Philip II himself publicly acknowledged that &quot;it is not possible to carry Flanders forward by way of war.&quot; Political concessions by Luis de Requesens failed to end the rebellion in the Netherlands and hostilities soon resumed. These failures of the Ebolistas to end the Dutch revolt raised the distrust of the king, and Philip II again granted the Duke of Alba an important position in court.

=== Portuguese succession (1580–82) ===

After the death of King Sebastian of Portugal, who had no heirs, in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in 1578, the crown fell to his great uncle Cardinal Henry I of Portugal. The death of the latter, without any appointed heirs, led to the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580.

One of the claimants to the throne, António, Prior of Crato, a bastard son of Infante Louis, Duke of Beja and only grandson through the male line of king Manuel I of Portugal, was proclaimed King in June 1580.

Philip II, through his mother Isabella of Portugal also a grandson of Manuel I, did not recognize Antonio as king of Portugal.
The king appointed Fernando, Duke of Alba, as captain general of his army. The duke was 73 years old and ill at the time. Fernando mustered his forces, estimated at 20,000 men, in Badajoz, and in June 1580 crossed the Spanish-Portuguese border and moved to Lisbon. In late August he defeated a Portuguese army at the Battle of Alcântara and entered Lisbon. This cleared the way for Philip II who became Philip I of Portugal, and created a dynastic union spanning all of Iberia under the Spanish crown.

King Philip II rewarded Fernando with the titles of 1st Viceroy of Portugal and Constable of Portugal on 18 July 1580. With these titles Fernando represented the Spanish monarch in Portugal and was second in hierarchy only after the king in Portugal. Fernando held both titles until his death in 1582.
== Marriage and children ==
His first child, Fernando de Toledo (1527–1591), was an illegitimate son with a miller&#x27;s daughter in the town of La Aldehuela.

27 April 1529 the Duke married his cousin María Enríquez de Toledo y Guzmán (died 1583), daughter of Diego Enríquez de Guzmán, III Count of Alba de Liste, with whom he had four children.
* García Álvarez de Toledo y Enríquez de Guzmán (1530–1548)
* Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo y Enríquez de Guzman, IV Duke of Alba (1537–1585)
* Diego Álvarez de Toledo y Enríquez de Guzmán (1541–1583), Count of Lerín and Constable of Navarre by his marriage, held on 24 March 1565, with Brianda Beaumont (1540–1588), daughter of Luis de Beaumont. He was succeeded by Antonio Álvarez de Toledo y Beaumont, V Duke of Alba de Tormes (1568–1639)
* Beatriz Álvarez de Toledo y Enríquez de Guzmán (died 1637), married Álvaro Pérez Osorio, V Marquess of Astorga.

== Later years and death ==
Alba died in Lisbon on 11 December 1582, at the age of seventy-five; he was given the last rites by the famous Luis de Granada.

His remains were transferred to Alba de Tormes, where he was buried in the convent of San Leonardo. In 1619 they were transferred to the Convento de San Esteban, Salamanca. In 1983 a mausoleum was erected over his grave, funded by the Provincial Deputation of Salamanca.

== Aceh War reference ==

In 1904 an intensive debate took place in the Dutch press and House of Representatives on the conduct of Gotfried Coenraad Ernst van Daalen, a Dutch commander who during the then current Aceh War was charged with the killing of numerous civilians, including women and children, during the conquest of Aceh in northern Sumatra. Some of van Daalen&#x27;s detractors compared his conduct with the atrocities committed by the Duke of Alba, still well remembered in Dutch historical memory.

<text>An emblem is an abstract or representational pictorial image that represents a concept, like a moral truth, or an allegory, or a person, like a monarch or saint.

==Emblems vs. symbols==

Although the words &quot;emblem&quot; and &quot;symbol&quot; are often used interchangeably, an emblem is a pattern that is used to represent an idea or an individual. An emblem develops in concrete, visual terms some abstraction: a deity, a tribe or nation, or a virtue or vice.

An emblem may be worn or otherwise used as an identifying badge or patch. For example, in America, police officers&#x27; badges refer to their personal metal emblem whereas their woven emblems on uniforms identify members of a particular unit. A real or metal cockle shell, the emblem of James the Great, sewn onto the hat or clothes, identified a medieval pilgrim to his shrine at Santiago de Compostela. In the Middle Ages, many saints were given emblems, which served to identify them in paintings and other images: St. Catherine of Alexandria had a wheel, or a sword, St. Anthony the Abbot, a pig and a small bell. These are also called attributes, especially when shown carried by or close to the saint in art. Monarchs and other grand persons increasingly adopted personal devices or emblems that were distinct from their family heraldry. The most famous include Louis XIV of France&#x27;s sun, the salamander of Francis I of France, the boar of Richard III of England and the armillary sphere of Manuel I of Portugal. In the fifteenth and sixteenth century, there was a fashion, started in Italy, for making large medals with a portrait head on the obverse and the emblem on the reverse; these would be given to friends and as diplomatic gifts. Pisanello produced many of the earliest and finest of these.

A symbol, on the other hand, substitutes one thing for another, in a more concrete fashion:
* The Christian cross is a symbol of the crucifixion of Jesus; it is an emblem of sacrifice.
* The Red Cross is one of three symbols representing the International Red Cross. A red cross on a white background is the emblem of humanitarian spirit.
* The crescent shape is a symbol of the moon; it is an emblem of Islam.
* The skull and crossbones is a symbol identifying a poison. The skull is an emblem of the transitory nature of human life.

==Other terminology==

A totem is specifically an animal emblem that expresses the spirit of a clan. Emblems in heraldry are known as charges. The lion passant serves as the emblem of England, the lion rampant as the emblem of Scotland.

An icon consists of an image (originally a religious image), that has become standardized by convention. A logo is an impersonal, secular icon, usually of a corporate entity.

== Emblems in history ==
Since the 15th century, the terms of emblem (&quot;emblema&quot;; from , meaning &quot;embossed ornament&quot;) and emblematura belong to the &quot;termini technici&quot; of architecture. They mean an iconic painted, drawn, or sculptural representation of a concept affixed to houses and belong—like the inscriptions—to the architectural ornaments (ornamenta). Since the publication of 
 (1452) by Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), patterned after the by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius, &quot;emblema&quot; are related to Egyptian hieroglyphics and are considered as being the lost universal language. Therefore, the emblems belong to the Renaissance knowledge of antiquity which comprises not only Greek and Roman antiquity but also Egyptian antiquity as proven by the numerous obelisks built in 16th and 17th century Rome. 

Evidence of the use of emblems in pre-Columbian America has also been found, such as those used in Mayan city states, kingdoms, and even empires such as the Aztec or Inca. The use of these in the American context does not differ much from the contexts of other regions of the world, being even the equivalent of the coats of arms of their respective territorial entities.

The 1531 publication in Augsburg of the first emblem book, the &quot;Emblemata&quot; of the Italian jurist Andrea Alciato launched a fascination with emblems that lasted two centuries and touched most of the countries of western Europe. &quot;Emblem&quot; in this sense refers to a didactic or moralizing combination of picture and text intended to draw the reader into a self-reflective examination of their own life. Complicated associations of emblems could transmit information to the culturally-informed viewer, a characteristic of the 16th-century artistic movement called Mannerism.

A popular collection of emblems, which ran to many editions, was presented by Francis Quarles in 1635. Each of the emblems consisted of a paraphrase from a passage of Scripture, expressed in ornate and metaphorical language, followed by passages from the Christian Fathers, and concluding with an epigram of four lines. These were accompanied by an emblem that presented the symbols displayed in the accompanying passage.

== Emblems in speech ==
Emblems are certain gestures which have a specific meaning attached to them. These meanings are usually associated with the culture they are established in. Using emblems creates a way for humans to communicate with one another in a non-verbal way. An individual waving their hand at a friend, for example, would communicate &quot;hello&quot; without having to verbally say anything.

=== Emblems vs. sign language ===
Although sign language uses hand gestures to communicate words in a non-verbal way, it should not be confused with emblems. Sign language contains linguistic properties, similar to those used in verbal languages, and is used to communicate entire conversations. Linguistic properties are verbs, nouns, pronouns, adverbs, adjectives, etc.. In contrast with sign language, emblems are a non-linguistic form of communication. Emblems are single gestures which are meant to get a short non-verbal message to another individual.

== Emblems in culture ==
Emblems are associated with the culture they are established in and are subjective to that culture. For example, the sign made by forming a circle with the thumb and forefinger is used in America to communicate &quot;OK&quot; in a non-verbal way, in Japan to mean &quot;money&quot;, and in some southern European countries to mean something sexual. Furthermore, the thumbs up sign in America means &quot;good job &quot;, but in some parts of the Middle East the thumbs up sign means something highly offensive.

<text>Zhoushan is an urbanized archipelago with the administrative status of a prefecture-level city in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang. It consists of an archipelago of islands at the southern mouth of Hangzhou Bay off the mainland city of Ningbo. The prefecture&#x27;s city proper is Dinghai on Zhoushan Island, now administered as the prefecture&#x27;s Dinghai District. During the 2020 census, Zhoushan Prefecture&#x27;s population was 1,157,817, out of whom 882,932 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of two urban districts of Dinghai and Putuo.

On 8 July 2011, the central government approved Zhoushan as Zhoushan Archipelago New Area, a state-level new area.

==History==
The archipelago was inhabited 6,000 years ago, during the Neolithic by people of the Hemudu culture. During the Spring and Autumn period, Zhoushan was called Yongdong, referring to its location east of the Yong River. At the time, it belonged to the state of Yue. The fishermen and sailors who inhabited the islands often engaged in piracy and became recruits for uprisings against the central authorities. At the time of the Eastern Jin, the Zhoushan Islands served as the base for Sun En&#x27;s rebellion. Sun En, an adherent of the Taoist sect the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice, launched his rebellion around the year 400 and was defeated by Jin forces in 402. Today&#x27;s Zhoushan was first created as in Ming Prefecture in 738 under the Tang.

In 863, the Japanese Buddhist monk and a Putuoshan local Zhang-shi () placed a statue of Guanyin at Chaoyin Cave () that would later become a popular tourist and pilgrim destination. In 1073, under the Song, it was renamed ; this was upgraded to a prefecture in the early Yuan dynasty. During the Ming dynasty, especially between the years 1530 and 1560, Japanese and Chinese pirates used Zhoushan as one of their principal bases from which they launched attacks as far as Nanjing; &quot;the whole Chinese coast from northern Shandong to western Guangdong was ravaged to a distance of sixty miles inland.&quot;

After suppression of the pirates, Zhoushan became an important commercial port of entry. Under the early Qing dynasty, it played a similar role to Xiamen and Guangzhou as a frequent port of call for Western traders. Changguo Prefecture became within Zhejiang Province in 1688 under the Qing. The restriction of all European trade to the port of Guangzhou in 1760 forced Westerners to leave Zhoushan. One of the requests of Lord Macartney&#x27;s embassy to the Qianlong Emperor in 1793 was an acquisition of &quot;a small unfortified island near Zhoushan for the residence of English traders, storage of goods, and outfitting of ships.&quot; The Qianlong Emperor denied this request together with all the rest.

British forces under Captain Charles Elliot captured Zhoushan on 5–6 July 1840 during the First Opium War and evacuated it in early 1841, after Elliot reached an agreement with Qishan, the Governor-General of Tianjin and Grand Secretary to the Daoguang Emperor, in exchange for Hong Kong. At that time, Zhoushan was a well known port while Hong Kong was still only a fishing village. The British Foreign Secretary Palmerston was furious when he learned that Elliot agreed to the cede Zhoushan for Hong Kong, described as &quot;a barren island with hardly a house on it&quot; Elliot was dismissed in April 1841 for his blunder. His replacement Sir Henry Pottinger led a British fleet that recaptured Zhoushan on 1 October 1841. The First Opium War ended with conclusion of the Treaty of Nanjing in which China opened up the cities of Guangzhou (&quot;Canton&quot;), Fuzhou (&quot;Foochow&quot;), Xiamen (&quot;Amoy&quot;), Ningbo (&quot;Ningpo&quot;), and Shanghai to residence by British subjects for the purpose of trade. As a result, Britain no longer had any use for Zhoushan but it kept the island until 1846 as a guarantee for the fulfilment of the stipulations of the treaty. Dinghai was upgraded to a directly controlled subprefecture () sometime in 1841.

Zhoushan was also occupied by the British in 1860 during the Second Opium War. Wang Yijun, a leader of the Taiping rebels, attempted to retake Zhoushan from its Qing garrison on 13 February 1862 but was defeated and killed.

Following the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China, Dinghai Subprefecture reverted to a county. Sun Yat-sen visited Zhoushan on 25 August 1916 and wrote &quot;Travelling to Putuo&quot; (, &quot;You Putuo Zhiqi&quot;). On 1 October 1942, the Japanese ship &quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; was transporting 1,800 POWs to Tokyo when she was attacked by the USS&quot;Grouper&quot; off Qingbing () or Dongfu; one torpedo hit and she sank the next day. The fishermen of nearby Dongji () rescued 384 of the British prisoners from the wreckage. Amid the Chinese Civil War, Dinghai County lost Shengsi, which became an Archipelago Directly controlled District () of Jiangsu in 1946, then a separate county in October 1949. The same year, Dinghai County was divided into Dinghai and Wengzhou () Counties. In November, the Communists landed on Dengbu Island, but were repulsed by the defenders.

Nevertheless, Zhoushan was overrun by the Communists on 17 May 1950. Wengzhou was merged back into Dinghai County, which made up part of Ningbo Prefecture, and Shengsi made up a special area () and then county of the Songjiang Prefecture, then still part of Jiangsu. In March 1953, the Council of Ministers opted to establish the Zhoushan Prefecture, returning Shengsi and dividing Dinghai into Dinghai, Putuo, and Daishan. Ningbo&#x27;s Xiangshan County was also briefly incorporated into this new prefecture from 1954 to 1958. From 1958 to May 1962, Zhoushan was incorporated into Ningbo before becoming a separate prefecture again. Shengsi was temporarily assigned to Shanghai in the early 1960s. The short-lived Daqu County () was created in 1962 before being redivided between Daishan and Shengsi four years later.

Zhoushan was promoted to a prefecture-level &quot;city&quot; on 27 January 1987, with Dinghai and Putuo Counties upgraded to districts. The municipal People&#x27;s Government was established on 8 March of that year. April of the same year, the ports of Zhoushan became open to foreign ships. On 10 April 1988, it became a coastal economic open zone.

==Administrative divisions==

Zhoushan includes of marine territory, but only of land, of which are submerged during high tides. It is east-west and north-south and although heavily populated now has few farms.

Zhoushan has a four-season, monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with cool, damp winters, and hot, humid summers. Conditions, especially during summer, are generally moderated by the surrounding waters of the East China Sea, bringing a January average of and August average of , with an annual mean of . Precipitation is significant throughout the year, with the greatest rainfall during summer. With 1,823.7 hours of bright sunshine annually, ranging from 30% sunshine in June to 53% in July and August, the second half of the year is sunnier.

==Demographics==
According to the report from the Sixth National Population Census of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the total population of Zhoushan Municipality is 1,121,261 with 588,414 males and 532,847 females as of 1 November 2010, among which an overwhelmingly majority is Han Chinese (1,109,813). The number of households is about 454,800. For an administrative division distribution, Dinghai District has a population of 464,184, Putuo District has a population of 378,805, Daishan County has a population of 202,164 and Shengsi County has a population of 76,108. In terms of education attainment, about 10 percent of the total population (115,286) has received higher education, while a population of 77,577 is illiterate or semiliterate. In terms of age distribution, there is a child (aged 0–14) population of 114,265 and a senior population of 176,331.

==Economy==
Traditionally Zhoushan had relied heavily on the primary sector, especially fishing, given Zhoushan is the largest fishery in China. Nowadays with the development of the secondary and tertiary sectors, Zhoushan&#x27;s economic base has been largely diversified. Ship building and repairing, shipping, light industry, tourism and service industry grow to be the major contributors of local economic output. In 2016, the entire municipality achieved a total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 122.85 billion yuan (approximately 16,013 US dollars per capita), with an increase of 11.3% from the previous year. The city continuously ranked 3rd among 11 municipalities of Zhejiang Province. However, since Zhoushan has a significantly smaller population compared with other municipalities, the absolute figure of total GDP still ranked the last place in the province. The structure of three sectors of industry is 10.6 : 39.8 : 49.6. In 2012, Zhoushan Port alone processed 290,990 kilotons of cargo. If combined with Ningbo Port (Ningbo and Zhoushan Ports are essentially one port with shared infrastructure, harbor basin and administrative collaboration), the entire greater port handled approximately 744,000 kilotons of cargo, surpassing Shanghai Port to be world&#x27;s new busiest port in terms of cargo tonnage.

In 2012, Zhoushan&#x27;s per capita disposable income of urban residents reached 34,224 yuan, with a 12.2% increase from the previous year (an increase of 10.3% considering the price and inflation factors). On the other hand, Zhoushan&#x27;s per capital net income of rural residents reached 18,601 yuan, with a 12.9% increase from the previous year (an increase of 11.0% considering the price and inflation factors). The Engel&#x27;s Coefficients for urban and rural residents are 35.9% and 38.1% respectively. The average housing building areas are 32.39 and 49.10 square meters for urban and rural residents respectively.

==Transportation==
Zhoushan is served by different modes of transportation, including air, highway and water. The transportation condition in Zhoushan has been improved largely during recent years, especially after the opening of Zhoushan Trans-Oceanic Bridges in 2009, which established a stable corridor connecting to the continent and converted Zhoushan into a peninsula per se. Due to geographical isolation, Zhoushan is the only one of the municipalities in Zhejiang Province which is not served with rail transportation.

===Air transportation===

*Although named after Mt. Putuo, Zhoushan Putuoshan International Airport is located on Zhujiajian Island, and is a domestic hub with scheduled passenger flights to several cities in China, including Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Hefei, Lianyungang, Jieyang and Jinjiang. The construction of the airport began in March 1997 and completed in August 1997 with an investment of 410 million RMB yuan, and is rated as a 4D airport. As of 2016, Zhoushan Airport is the 86th largest civic airport in Mainland China in terms of passengers handled with a total of 800.9 thousand users. Expansion including a new terminal and taxiway is under construction.

===Road transportation===
*Zhoushan Trans-Oceanic Bridges (), the indispensable component of Yongzhou Expressway () (numbered G9211 in the National Trunk Highway System), consist of five consecutive bridges which connect Zhoushan to the mainland, Zhenhai District of Ningbo to be specific. These five bridges are Cengang Bridge (), Xiangjiaomen Bridge (), Taoyaomen Bridge (), Xihoumen Bridge () and Jintang Bridge (). The painstaking huge project, started in 1999 and completed in 2010, is the largest bridge group in China. Xihoumen Bridge, in particular, is the world&#x27;s second-longest suspension bridge in terms of the length of the central span.

*China National Highway 329, which starts from Hangzhou and ends in Zhujiajian Sub-district of Zhoushan with a current length of , is the only national highway serving the city of Zhoushan. It is also the shortest national level highway that runs in the east–west direction. Before reaching Zhoushan, Highway 329 passes through municipalities of Shaoxing and Ningbo. The route between the boundaries of Ningbo and Zhoushan is built in the form of ferry, which is also unique in the national highway system. The ferry dock on Ningbo&#x27;s side is named Baifeng, and the one on Zhoushan&#x27;s side is named Yadanshan. The route of Highway 329 in Zhoushan has undergone several changes and adjustments. Initially the route went through the southern shoreline of Zhoushan Island and ended in Shenjiamen. However, with the construction of Zhujiajian Bridge, the route was extended all the way to Nansha Beach of Zhujiajian Island. Later, with the development Dinghai and Lincheng, part of Highway 329 was designated as urban roads instead of a rapid passing corridor. Therefore, Highway 329 went on to take the route of the outer ring road of Dinghai and Highway Baiquan-Shenjiamen. Recently to optimize the highway structure of Zhoushan, Highway 329 is undergoing another large modification in its route. The new route, designed with a series of tunnels and interchanges, will run at the center of Zhoushan Island to form its backbone. Seven tunnels on the new route account for a length of . A total of 5 interchanges are designed along the new route. The project, projected to spend 5 billion yuan, is set to finish in 2015.
*Zhoushan bus rapid transit () is the rapid transit system with dedicated lanes between urban agglomerations on Zhoushan Island. Line One, designed with a route of , started to operate since 1 October 2013 connecting Dinghai and Donggang, Putuo. A total of 10 BRT stops are set on Line One: Dinghai Dongmen (), Dinghai Tanfeng (), Dinghai Chengdong (), Xincheng Nanhai (), Xincheng Central (), Xincheng Zhoushan Hospital (), Xincheng Fulidao Road (), Putuo Puxi (), Putuo Chengbei (), and Putuo Donggang Gymnasium (). The service time for Line One starts at 6:30 and ends at 20:00 with a frequency of approximately 120 daily. The standard fare is 2 yuan regardless of stops traveled. Passengers with public transit IC cards are eligible for a 20 percentage discount per trip. Passengers can transfer to normal public transit buses once for free within one hour of initial aboard time. All buses are covered with 4G wireless signal. Other lines are being planned and will be constructed in the near future.

===Rail transportation===
*The under construction Ningbo–Zhoushan railway will start from Ningbo Station and end in Zhoushan Baiquan Station, with a total length of . The line is planned to include 9 stations. The section between Ningbo East Station and Jintang Station runs passenger and freight trains, while the section between Jintang Station and Baiquan Station is a dedicated line for passengers.

===Water transportation===
*Two major ferry routes with high frequency (intervals vary from fifteen minutes to an hour) connect Zhoushan Main Island to Shanghai to the north and Ningbo to the south. Besides, there are scheduled ships travelling between Zhoushan and other ports, such as Wenzhou and Fuzhou. Major inhabited islands within the municipality are served by smaller scale ferries and speedboat fleets. Frequencies depend on levels of population.

==Energy==
There exist 2 power connections: HVDC Zhoushan, the first HVDC built in China and Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie with the tallest electricity pylons in the world, as well as the world&#x27;s longest span.

==Tourism==

Zhoushan, which proudly boasts two national level key scenic areas (Mount Putuo and Shengsi Islands) and two provincial level key scenic areas (Taohua Island and Daishan), is always praised to be the &quot;backyard garden&quot; of Yangtze River Delta. Beside these scenic areas, Zhoushan has an abundance of points of interest, landscape forms and tourism resources, many of which are still under development, due to its rich historic and natural endowment. Conveniently connected to the continental part of the delta, Zhoushan attracted 27.71 million visitors (which is approximately 25 times its population), 310.5 thousand of whom were from abroad, in 2012 alone. Tourism and its related services have risen to be a very important sector of the municipal economy with a total tourism revenue of 26.68 billion yuan, according to the 2012 statistic.

===Mount Putuo National Scenic Area===
Mount Putuo National Scenic Area () consists of two parts, Mount Putuo and Zhujiajian Eastern Coast, although most people would easily ignore the latter part due to its overwhelming fame of Mount Putuo. The scenic area, with a total area of , is the only place in China where combines the mountain and sea views, and religious culture perfectly.

On a visit in the early 1830s, missionary Karl Gützlaff noted that the island of &quot;Poo-to&quot; boasted two large and 60 small temples, attended by 2,000 monks,

To every person who visits this island, it appears at first like a fairy land, so romantic is everything which meets the eye. Those large inscriptions hewn in solid granite, the many temples which appear in every direction, the highly picturesque scenery itself, with its many-peaked, riven, and detached rocks, and above all a stately mausoleum, the largest which I have ever seen, containing the bones and ashes of thousands of priests, quite bewilder the imagination.

Mount Putuo (), also named Mount Meicen () and Mount Baihua (), is considered the bodhimanda of Avalokitesvara (Guanyin), a revered Bodhisattva in many parts of East Asia. It is one of the four sacred mountains in Chinese Buddhism, the others being Mount Wutai, Mount Jiuhua, and Mount Emei. However, different from other three sacred mountains which are mountains with heights of more than , Mount Putuo is actually a small island with a total area of , the highest point of which is Peak Foding ( above sea level). Mount Putuo features three grand temples (Puji Temple, Fayu Temple, and Huiji Temple), three treasures (Tahoto Pagoda, Yangzhi Guanyin Stele, and Nine-Dragon Caisson), three rocks (Rock Pantuo, Heart Rock, and Rock Ergui Tingfa), three caves (Cave Chaoyang, Cave Chaoyin and Cave Fanyin), 88 nunneries and 128 huts, and twelve scenes. Mount Putuo was praised in various historic records. It is often titled as Bulguksa Among Seas and Skies (), or Sacred Ground on the Southern Seas (). Mount Putuo is always mentioned in the same breath with the West Lake in Hangzhou, another national scenic area of Zhejiang. West Lake is considered to be the foremost place that combines mountain and lake views, whereas Mount Putuo is deemed as the top place where integrates mountain and sea views ().
Zhujiajian () is the fifth largest island of the archipelago and a newly developed seaside resort with intriguing seascapes, unmarred beaches, dense woods, sheer rock cliffs, hills for hiking, extraordinary seafood and displays of fishermen folk culture. It is home to the Zhoushan International Sand Sculpture Festival, which is held on the Nansha Beach, one of the five consecutive beaches, at the turn of summer and autumn every year. Daqing Mountain is the best location to get the incomparable view of southern Zhoushan Islands and the continental China (Chuanshan Peninsula) on clear days. It is also an ideal place for extreme sports, such as car racing, mountain cycling, gliding, rock climbing and bungee jumping. Baishan Mountain features huge natural rocks of different shapes, Guanyin carving on the cliff, and the Putuo Impression show, directed by Zhang Yimou. Zhujiajian is also the site for Mount Putuo Buddhist Academy. Wushitang (Dark Stone Beach) is the beach consisting of numerous dark colored pebbles.

===Shengsi Islands National Scenic Area===
Shengsi Islands National Scenic Area () is the only national level scenic area in China that is established on a group of natural islands. The scenic area, consisting of hundreds of islands outlying the Hangzhou Bay, boasts multiple quality beaches, rocks, and cliffs. Although it is commonly endowed with natural seascape beauty, each island is unique. Jihu and Nanchangtu Twin Beaches, the northernmost sand beaches of Southern China (and the natural beaches closest to Shanghai), make Sijiao Island a popular tourism destination. Shengshan is one of the most important fishing ports on the East China Sea. The eastern coast of Shengshan Island features steep cliffs, an ideal place to view sunrise above the sea. On the north coast is the abandoned fishing village of Houtouwan, now overgrown with vegetation. Gouqi Island has well-preserved fishing villages and cultures, the largest aquatic farm in China and the Mountain and Sea Wonders () rock that was believed to be left by General Hou Jigao of the Ming dynasty, who defended the southeastern coast against the raids from wokou. Huaniao Island features the Huaniao Lighthouse, initially built in 1870 with the reputation of the first lighthouse of the Far East (), that stands on the busiest shipping route in China entering and leaving Shanghai and the Yangtze River. The lighthouse has been on the National Major Historical and Cultural Sites list under protection since 2001.

===Taohua Island Provincial Level Scenic Area===

Taohua Island is the most botanically diversified island in Zhejiang&#x27;s coastal area, with nearly 600 species of trees and plants, including oranges, orchids and narcissus – and now peach trees. It is also a popular site for shooting movies and TV series based on Jin Yong&#x27;s novels. Four Chinese TV serials – &quot;The Eagle-Shooting Heroes,&quot; &quot;Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils,&quot; &quot;The Return of the Condor Heroes&quot; and &quot;Duke of Mount Deer&quot; – were filmed on the island. Starting from 2004, the Jin Yong Martial Arts (Wuxia) Culture Festival is held here every other year around summer. It offers dazzling martial arts performances and competitions, all thrilling for Cha&#x27;s fans.

===Daishan Provincial Level Scenic Area===
Daishan (岱山), originally known as Penglai, is believed to have been reached by Xu Fu of the Qin dynasty during his eastward journey to Japan. Mount Moxin, with a height of above sea level, is the highest peak on Daishan Island, from where visitors can get the fantastic view of Gaoting, the county seat, and nearby islands and water channels. Ciyun Temple is the major temple on Mount Moxin and a popular scenic spot. Lulan-qingsha Beach, measuring long and wide, is the single longest beach of Eastern China. It is an ideal place for camping, flying kites, and movie-shooting. The beach is also the location for yearly worship services or matsuris of the ocean for fishing harvest. Dongsha Ancient Town was once the county seat of Daishan, with hundreds years of commercial and exchange activities associated to traditional fishing industry. Several major buildings and facilities have been well protected. Shuanghe features wonderful large-scale man-made cliffs and precipices which are the result of hundreds years of carving for granite materials for architectural purposes. Daishan has the reputation of being a county of museums. Its collection of museums include themes such as fishing culture, Zhoushan dialect, typhoon, lighthouse, salt production, etc. Besides the above-stated attractions on Daishan Island, other islands are noteworthy as well. For example, Xiushan Island features the only inter-tidal mud theme park in China. Qushan Island features Mount Guanyin, which is also a bodhimanda of Guanyin. Changtu is a traditional fishing port.

==Other attractions==
*Dongji Islands (), formerly known as Zhongjieshan Chain of Islands (中街山列岛), is a group of islands located at the eastmost end of the Zhoushan Archipelago, extending far into the East China Sea. It is famous for well-preserved original fishing villages, and unpolluted natural seascapes.
*Shenjiamen Fishing Port () is the traditional center of Zhoushan Fishery and the largest fishing port of China. Its seafront promenade of open-air seafood restaurants is widely appreciated for fresh seafood served, wonderful views of the port and plenty of strolling musicians.
*Opium War Memorial (Zhushan Park) () is an urban park at the southwestern corner of Dinghai county town in memory of the battle fought between Zhoushaners and the British around 1840, notably the heroic deeds of three generals, Ge Yunfei, Wang Xipeng and Zheng Guohong.

<text>ONE is a boy band that first appeared in 1999, recognized as both Greece and Cyprus&#x27;s first boy band. The band was formed by leading Cypriot-Greek composer Giorgos Theofanous and Minos EMI A&amp;R Manager Vangelis Yannopoulos. Constantinos Christophorou and Philippos-Constantinos Philippou were on board quite early, chosen by Giorgos Theofanous. The next three members were picked up after a selective audition that took place in legendary Athenian Sierra Studio. The selecting committee consisted of Natalia Germanou, Posidonas Yannopoulos, Andreas Kouris, Themis Georgandas, Theofanous and Yannopoulos. Demetres Koutsavlakis, Argyris Nastopoulos and Panos Tserpes were retained among 179 candidates. Christoforou followed a solo career in 2003, and was replaced by another Cypriot singer, Demos Beke. In their 6-year existence they enjoyed much commercial success and earned platinum certifications, as well as having staged memorable performances with successful Greek singers at music halls and in concerts. In 2005 the band formally disbanded and reunited in 2019.

In July 1999 they released their first single, with their debut album following in October. All music and lyrics were written by Giorgos Theofanous (as was all the rest of the musical recorded material of the band) while Vangelis Yannopoulos was producing.

==Eurovision 2002==
At the end of 2001, national Cypriot broadcaster CyBC requested that they participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. They agreed and Theofanous wrote the song &quot;Gimme&quot; especially for the occasion. Backup vocals were performed by Christina Argyri who was part of the stage duo &quot;Voice&quot; who represented Cyprus in 2000. After finishing in 6th place they became famous in both Cyprus and Greece and landed platinum certifications.

This was Christoforou&#x27;s second Eurovision performance as already having represented Cyprus in 1996 with the song &quot;Mono Yia Mas&quot;.

Christoforou went on to once again represent Cyprus as a solo artist in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 with the song &quot;Ela Ela (Come Baby)&quot;.

==Reunion and new music==

<text>James A. Owen (born November 11, 1969) is an American comic book illustrator, publisher and writer. He is known for his creator-owned comic book series &quot;Starchild&quot; and as the author of &quot;The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica&quot; novel series, that began with &quot;Here, There Be Dragons&quot; in 2006.

==Career==

Owen self-published the black-and-white fantasy series &quot;Starchild&quot; under his Taliesin Press imprint in the 1990s. Adopting the name Coppervale Press for &quot;Starchild: Crossroads&quot;, he gave up self publishing in 1997 for &quot;Starchild: Mythopolis&quot;, five issues of which were published by Image Comics. Owen returned to self publishing, compiling a volume of Starchild reprints via a Kickstarter campaign in 2015.

Later, Owen reinvented himself as a novelist, creating a fantasy series titled &quot;Mythworld&quot; for a German publishing company. The books were later reprinted in the United States by Baen.

In 2003, Coppervale Press relaunched two newsstand style magazines, the fine arts-oriented &quot;International Studio&quot; and the fiction periodical &quot;Argosy&quot;, but both magazines ceased publication in 2004 after only a few issues. In 2009, a satirical short story by Jeff VanderMeer entitled &quot;Errata&quot; about &quot;Argosy&quot; and its demise was published by Tor Books.

In 2006 his novel &quot;Here, There Be Dragons&quot; was published, the first book in &quot;The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica&quot; series. The book had multiple printings, and was published around the world in more than twenty languages. It was followed by &quot;The Search for the Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Indigo King&quot; in 2008, &quot;The Shadow Dragons&quot; in 2009, &quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; 2010, &quot;The Dragons of Winter&quot; in 2012, and &quot;The First Dragon&quot; in 2013.

After releasing a non-fiction ebook of personal stories, , in early 2011, Owen had a successful Kickstarter project raising funds to create a limited first edition paperback and hard cover, as well as an audio version of the ebook.

Owen announced trilogy was picked up by Shadow Mountain Publishing but as of 2021, his work was out of print at the company.

<doc id="328783" wikidata="Q6229479" url="?curid=328783" title="John Disney (antiquarian)">
<text>John Disney (29 May 1779 – 6 May 1857) was an English barrister and antiquarian. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1832 and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1839.

==Life==
Born at Flintham Hall in Nottinghamshire, he was the eldest son of John Disney and his wife Jane Blackburne, daughter of Francis Blackburne and his wife. His father was a former Anglican clergyman who became one of the founders of the Episcopal Unitarian Church. He was from a long line of English Dissenters going back to Disney&#x27;s great-great grandfather John Disney and earlier.

Disney was educated at home in London until the age of 16, when he went to Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1798, he was admitted to the Inner Temple; he was called to the bar in 1803. He was appointed in 1807 Recorder of Bridport, Dorset, and went to live at Corscombe.

On his father&#x27;s death in 1816, Disney came into a substantial inheritance. It included a house, The Hyde, near Ingatestone in Essex, and land. There were libraries that had belonged to his father, Thomas Hollis, and Thomas Brand Hollis: these were sold. There was also a collection of antiquities including significant classical sculptures, that came from Hollis, Brand Hollis and Richard Mead, as well as other sources.
Disney was High Sheriff of Dorset in 1818. His wife inherited from her father in 1822. Disney left the post of Recorder at Bridport in 1823, and at some later point afterwards moved to Essex. He stood unsuccessfully as a political candidate in Harwich and North Essex.

==Collector==
The collection at The Hyde was built up by Disney, in particular when he visited Rome in 1826–7. It was further enlarged by gifts from Charles Callis Western and James Christie. The value of the collection has been debated, with Adolf Michaelis in the 19th century finding fault with the quality (&quot;trash rather than treasure&quot;), and Disney&#x27;s expertise in the area. It is now known that it included modern artefacts. The issue was studied again in 2012 by Caroline Vout (&quot;Treasure, not trash&quot;).

==Works==
Disney wrote on politics and the law:

*&quot;A collection of acts of parliament, relative to county and borough elections&quot; (1811)
*&quot;Outlines of a Penal Code&quot; (1826).

Building on a catalogue of the antiquarian collection made by his father, and supplemented by James Tate, Disney published in 1846 as &quot;Museum Disneianum&quot;. It included input from Taylor Combe, John Flaxman and Richard Westmacott. There was a second edition in 1848, and supplements; and a later edition under the title &quot;Fitzwilliam Museum&quot;.

==Legacy==
Disney presented most of the sculptures in his collection to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge in 1850. In 1851 he endowed with £1,000 the Disney Professorship of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. The first holder was John Howard Marsden, nominated by Disney. In 1857 an additional £3,500 left by Disney went to support the Professorship.

What remained of the collection at The Hyde was sold by Christie&#x27;s auction house in the years after Edgar Disney, the heir, died in 1881. The Fitzwilliam Museum acquired some of the pieces.

==Family==
Disney married his paternal first cousin Sophia Disney-Ffytche, daughter of Lewis Disney Fytche, in 1802. They had three children, two sons John and Edgar, and a daughter Sophia. John died young. Edgar Disney married Barbara, daughter of Lewis William Brouncker in 1834, and Sophia married William Jesse of the 17th Regiment in 1836.

<text>A computer scientist is a scientist who specializes in the academic study of computer science. 

Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computation. Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas (such as algorithm and data structure development and design, software engineering, information theory, database theory, theoretical computer science, numerical analysis, programming language theory, compiler, computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, computer architecture, operating system), their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive.

A primary goal of computer scientists is to develop or validate models, often mathematical, to describe the properties of computational systems (processors, programs, computers interacting with people, computers interacting with other computers, etc.) with an overall objective of discovering designs that yield useful benefits (faster, smaller, cheaper, more precise, etc.).

==Education==
Most computer scientists possess a PhD, M.S., or Bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science, or other similar fields like Information and Computer Science (CIS), a closely related discipline such as mathematics or physics.

===Areas of specialization===
*Theoretical computer science – including data structures and algorithms, theory of computation, information theory and coding theory, programming language theory, and formal methods
*Computer systems – including computer architecture and computer engineering, computer performance analysis, concurrency, and distributed computing, computer networks, computer security and cryptography, and databases. 
*Computer applications – including computer graphics and visualization, human–computer interaction, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence.
*Software engineering – the application of engineering to software development in a systematic method

==Employment==

Employment prospects for computer scientists are said to be excellent. Such prospects seem to be attributed, in part, to very rapid growth in computer systems design and related services industry, and the software publishing industry, which are projected to be among the fastest growing industries in the U.S. economy.

Computer scientists are often hired by software publishing firms, scientific research and development organizations, or universities where they develop the theories and computer models that allow new technologies to be developed.

Computer scientists can follow more practical applications of their knowledge, doing things such as software engineering. They can also be found in the field of information technology consulting, and may be seen as a type of mathematician, given how much of the field depends on mathematics. Computer scientists employed in industry may eventually advance into managerial or project leadership positions.
