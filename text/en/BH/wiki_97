<text>The water pipit (Anthus spinoletta) is a small passerine bird which breeds in the mountains of Southern Europe and the Palearctic eastwards to China. It is a short-distance migrant; many birds move to lower altitudes or wet open lowlands in winter.

The water pipit in breeding plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium (&quot;eyebrow&quot;), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences among the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit&#x27;s song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.

Water pipits construct a cup-like nest on the ground under vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled grey-ish white eggs, which hatch in about two weeks with a further 14–15 days to fledging. Although pipits occasionally catch insects in flight, they feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the ground or vegetation, and also some plant material.

The water pipit may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or act as an involuntary host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The family Motacillidae consists of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest of the three groups is the pipits, genus &quot;Anthus&quot;, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were both formerly considered subspecies of the European rock pipit. Of these, the rock pipit is the more closely related to the water pipit, based on external and molecular characteristics. Other near relatives are the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits.

The water pipit was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758 as &quot;Alauda spinoletta&quot; (characterised as &quot;A. rectricibus fuscis : extimis duabus oblique dimidiato-albis&quot;). The current genus &quot;Anthus&quot; was created for the pipits by German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1805. &quot;Anthus&quot; is the Latin name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific &quot;spinoletta&quot; is a local dialect word for a pipit from the Florence area of Italy.
There are three recognised subspecies of the water pipit:
* &quot;Anthus spinoletta spinoletta&quot;, (Linnaeus, 1758), the nominate subspecies, breeds in the mountains of southern Europe from the Pyrenees eastwards to northwestern Turkey, and on Sardinia and Corsica.
* &quot;Anthus spinoletta coutellii&quot;, Audouin, 1828, breeds in the mountains of Turkey other than the northwest, the Caucasus, northern Iran and Turkmenistan.
* &quot;Anthus spinoletta blakistoni, &quot; R. Swinhoe, 1863, breeds in mountains across Asia from southern Russia east to central China.

A possible fourth race from the northwestern Caucasus, &quot;Anthus spinoletta caucasicus&quot;, cannot be reliably separated from &quot;A.s. coutellii&quot;. The latter form is itself a potential new species, based on genetic data, appearance and a characteristic flight call.

==Description==

The water pipit is long and weighs . The adult of the nominate race in spring plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. There may be some faint streaking on the breast and flanks. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium. The outer tail feathers are white, and the legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish. In non-breeding plumage, the head is grey-brown and the supercilium is less distinct. The upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, marked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks.

The sexes are similar although the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. &quot;A. s. coutellii&quot; is smaller than the nominate subspecies and the white of the outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts&#x27; colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. &quot;A. s. blakistoni&quot; is large, pale and less strongly streaked.
The water pipit has a complete moult between July and September, although there is considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage as soon as a month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult is similar to that of the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.

The water pipit is closely related to the Eurasian rock pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also typically much warier. The habitats used by European rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.

The European rock pipit&#x27;s subspecies &quot;Anthus petrosus littoralis&quot; in summer plumage is particularly close in outward appearance to the water pipit. The rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area.

===Voice===

The water pipit&#x27;s song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the European rock pipit&#x27;s song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling &quot;cheepa&quot; notes followed by a rising series of thin &quot;gee&quot; calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp &quot;dzip&quot; or similar, slightly harsher than soft &quot;sip sip sip&quot; of the meadow pipit or the shrill &quot;pseep&quot; of the European rock pipit. The short, thin &quot;fist&quot; flight call is intermediate between the &quot;sip&quot; of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit&#x27;s &quot;feest&quot;. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies &quot;A. s. coutellii&quot; is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.

==Distribution and habitat==

The breeding range of the water pipit is the mountains of southern Europe and Asia from Spain to central China, along with the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica.

The water pipit is predominantly a mountain species in the breeding season, found in alpine pasture and high meadows with short grass and some bushes or rocks. It is typically found close to wetter areas and often on slopes. It breeds between altitude, mostly . It migrates relatively short distances in autumn to lower ground, typically wintering on coastal wetlands, marshes, rice fields and similar habitats. Although most birds move to lowlands, some may remain at up to . Nominate &quot;A. s. spinoletta&quot; winters mainly in western and southern Europe and in northwestern Africa; in western Europe some birds show fidelity to the same wintering site, returning each year. Birds in Spain appear to move only lower down the mountains in which they breed. &quot;A.s. coutellii&quot; winters at lower altitudes near its breeding areas and also in the Arabian Peninsula and northeast Africa. &quot;A.s. blakistoni&quot; winters in Pakistan, northwest India and southern China.

Water pipits leave their breeding sites from mid-September, although the eastern subspecies may start moving south before then. The spring migration starts in February and March, with arrival on the breeding grounds in April and May. The water pipit has been recorded as a vagrant in Belarus, Gibraltar and Latvia, and on islands including the Canaries, Iceland, Malta and Svalbard.

==Behaviour==

The water pipit is a much less approachable bird as compared to the European rock pipit. It is warier than its relative and if approached it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the rock pipit typically travels only a short distance, close to the ground, before it alights.

===Breeding===
The water pipit is mainly monogamous, although both sexes may deviate from this occasionally. The male has a display flight in which he climbs to , flies in an arc and glides back down, singing throughout. The female constructs a cup nest from grass and leaves which is lined with finer plant material and animal hairs. The nest is hidden in vegetation on the ground, sometimes in a hollow. The normal clutch is four to six eggs laid from the end of April to early July. Eggs are greyish white with darker grey or brownish speckles mainly at the wider end, and they measure and weigh of which 5% is shell.

The eggs are incubated by the female for 14–15 days to hatching. Chicks are fed initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty after a few days when the female does not need to brood so often, and they fledge in a further 14–15 days. There may be two broods in a year.

In a Swiss study of the nominate subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race &quot;A. s. blakistoni&quot; in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests were more likely to fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.

===Feeding===

The water pipit&#x27;s feeding habitat is damp grassland, rather than the rocky coasts favoured by the Eurasian rock pipit. The water pipit feeds mainly on a wide range of invertebrates, including crickets and grasshoppers, beetles, snails, millipedes and spiders. Barkflies, true flies, caterpillars and homopterans can form a large part of the diet of fledglings. Birds close to snow fields take insects specialised for that habitat such as the springtails &quot;Isotoma saltans&quot; (the glacier flea) and &quot;I. nivalis&quot;, and the scorpion fly &quot;Boreus izyemalis&quot;.

Birds normally forage alone or in pairs; in bad weather, foraging is more frequent and involves longer flights, and may be concentrated around marmot burrow entrances. Prey items average in length and are mainly hunted on foot, although flying insects are occasionally caught in the air. Some plant material is taken, and one study on the border of Czechoslovakia and Poland found that 75% of the diet by volume consisted of algae, specifically &quot;Ulothrix zonata&quot;, despite large numbers of insects being available.

In areas with acidic soils, there is less calcium available, potentially leading to thinner egg shells. In such locations, pipits are more likely to select snails and similar prey with calcium-rich shells than is the case in limestone terrain.

==Predators and parasites==

The water pipit is hunted by birds of prey including the Eleonora&#x27;s falcon, and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including stoats and snakes. As with other members of its genus, the water pipit is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs of cuckoos that specialise in parasitising pipits are similar in appearance to those of their hosts.

A new species of feather mite, &quot;Proctophyllodes schwerinensis&quot;, was discovered on the water pipit, which is also a host to the fleas &quot;Ceratophyllus borealis&quot; and &quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot;. Along with other Motacillidae species, the water pipit is a host of the protozoan parasite &quot;Haemoproteus anthi&quot;.

==Status==

Estimates of the European breeding population of the water pipit vary widely, but may be as high as two million pairs, which would suggest a global population of tens of millions of individuals spread over . The range is discontinuous due to the mountain habitat this species uses, but the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason the water pipit is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.

Breeding densities (in pairs per ten ha) have been recorded as 2.4 in the Jura Mountains, 3.0–3.6 in the Alps and 4.5 in the Tatra Mountains of Poland.

<text>Australian Baptist Ministries (formerly Australian Baptist Union, then Baptist Union of Australia,) is an Baptist Christian denomination in Australia. The Baptist Union of Australia was inaugurated on 24 August 1926 at the Burton Street Church in Sydney. The headquarters is in Belmont. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. 

==History==

Baptist work in Australia began in Sydney in 1831, forty-three years after the British penal colony was established. The first preacher was John McKaeg, who conducted the first Baptist service on Sunday 24 April in &quot;The Rose and Crown Inn&quot; on the corner of Castlereagh and King Streets. The first baptism, of two female congregants, was conducted by McKaeg in Woolloomooloo Bay on 12 August 1832.

It was not until 1835 that the first church was established in Hobart Town by Henry Dowling, a strict Calvinist. John Saunders, who had been sent by the Baptist Missionary Society of England to Sydney in 1834, raised the funding to erect a second church which was opened on 23 September 1836. The first state Union was formed in Victoria in 1862. The national Baptist Union was founded in 1926 by representatives from existing state unions. In 1978, Marita Munro became the first woman ordained pastor within the body. In 2009 it was renamed Australian Baptist Ministries. 

== Statistics ==
According to a census published by the association in 2024, it has 1,029 churches and 78,416 members.

<doc id="338651" wikidata="Q387548" url="?curid=338651" title="Hippodrome of Constantinople">
<text>The Hippodrome of Constantinople (; ; ), was a circus that was the sporting and social centre of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. Today it is a square in Istanbul, Turkey, known as Sultanahmet Square (). 

The word &quot;hippodrome&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;hippos&quot; (), horse, and &quot;dromos&quot; (δρόμος), path or way. For this reason, it is sometimes also called (&quot;Horse Square&quot;) in Turkish. Horse racing and chariot racing were popular pastimes in the ancient world and hippodromes were common features of Greek cities in the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine eras.

== History and use ==

=== Construction ===

Although the Hippodrome is usually associated with Constantinople&#x27;s days of glory as an imperial capital, it actually predates that era. The first Hippodrome was built when the city was called Byzantium, and was a provincial town of moderate importance. In AD 203 the Emperor Septimius Severus rebuilt the city and expanded its walls, endowing it with a hippodrome, an arena for chariot races and other entertainment.

In AD 324, the Emperor Constantine the Great decided to refound Byzantium after his victory at the nearby Battle of Chrysopolis; he renamed it &quot;Nova Roma&quot; (New Rome). This name failed to impress and the city soon became known as Constantinople, the City of Constantine. Constantine greatly enlarged the city, and one of his major undertakings was the renovation of the Hippodrome. It is estimated that the Hippodrome of Constantine was about long and wide. The &quot;carceres&quot; (starting gates) stood at the northern end; and the &quot;sphendone&quot; (curved tribune of the U-shaped structure, the lower part of which still survives) stood at the southern end. The &quot;spina&quot; (the middle barrier of the racecourse) was adorned with various monuments, including the monolithic obelisk, the erection of which is depicted in relief carvings on its base.

The stands were capable of holding 100,000 spectators. The race-track at the Hippodrome was U-shaped, and the Kathisma (emperor&#x27;s lodge) was located at the eastern end of the track. The Kathisma could be accessed directly from the Great Palace through a passage which only the emperor or other members of the imperial family could use.

=== Decoration ===
The hippodrome was filled with statues of gods, emperors, animals, and heroes, among them some famous works, such as a 4th-century BC Heracles by Lysippos, Romulus and Remus with the she-wolf Lupa, and the 5th-century BC Serpent Column. The &quot;carceres&quot; had four statues of horses in gilded copper on top, now called the Horses of Saint Mark. The horses&#x27; exact Greek or Roman ancestry has never been determined. They were looted during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and installed on the façade of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice. The track was lined with other bronze statues of famous horses and chariot drivers, none of which survive. In his book (book II,15, 589), the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus described the decorations in the hippodrome at the occasion of the visit of Saracen or Arab visitors, mentioning the purple hangings and rare tapestries. According to Hesychius of Miletus, there was once a statue of Hecate at the site.

=== Functions ===
Throughout the Byzantine period, the Hippodrome was the centre of the city&#x27;s social life. Huge amounts were bet on chariot races, and initially four teams took part in these races, each one financially sponsored and supported by a different political party (Deme) within the Byzantine Senate: The Blues (Venetoi), the Greens (Prasinoi), the Reds (Rousioi) and the Whites (Leukoi). The Reds (Rousioi) and the Whites (Leukoi) gradually weakened and were absorbed by the other two major factions (the Blues and Greens).

A total of up to eight chariots (two chariots per team), powered by four horses each, competed on the racing track of the Hippodrome. These races were not simple sporting events, but also provided some of the rare occasions in which the emperor and the common citizens could come together in a single venue. Political discussions were often made at the Hippodrome, which could be directly accessed by the emperor through a passage that connected the Kathisma with the Great Palace of Constantinople.

The rivalry between the Blues and Greens often became mingled with political or religious rivalries, and sometimes riots, which amounted to civil wars that broke out in the city between them. The most severe of these was the Nika riots of 532, in which an estimated 30,000 people were killed and many important buildings were destroyed, such as the nearby second Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine cathedral. The current (third) Hagia Sophia was built by Justinian I following the Nika riots.

=== Decline ===
Constantinople never recovered from its sack during the Fourth Crusade and even though the Byzantine Empire survived until 1453, by that time, the Hippodrome had fallen into ruin, pillaged by the Venetians who likely took the four horses now in San Marco from a monument there. The Ottomans, whose Sultan Mehmed II captured the city in 1453 and made it the capital of the Ottoman Empire, were not interested in chariot racing and the Hippodrome was gradually forgotten, although the site was never actually built over. The hippodrome was used as a source of building stone, however.

== Hippodrome monuments ==
=== Serpent Column ===
To raise the image of his new capital, Constantine and his successors, especially Theodosius the Great, brought works of art from all over the empire to adorn it. The monuments were set up in the middle of the Hippodrome, the &quot;spina&quot;. Among these was the sacrificial tripod of Plataea, now known as the Serpent Column, cast to celebrate the victory of the Greeks over the Persians during the Persian Wars in the 5th century BC. Constantine ordered the Tripod to be moved from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, and set in middle of the Hippodrome. The top was adorned with a golden bowl supported by three serpent heads, although it appears that this was never brought to Constantinople. The serpent heads and top third of the column were destroyed in 1700. Parts of the heads were recovered and are displayed at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. All that remains of the Delphi Tripod today is the base, known as the &quot;Serpent Column&quot;.

=== Obelisk of Thutmose III ===

Another emperor to adorn the Hippodrome was Theodosius the Great, who in 390 brought an obelisk from Egypt and erected it inside the racing track. Carved from pink granite, it was originally erected at the Temple of Karnak in Luxor during the reign of Thutmose III in about 1490 BC. Theodosius had the obelisk cut into three pieces and brought it to Constantinople. The top section survives, and it stands today where Theodosius placed it, on a marble pedestal. The granite obelisk has survived nearly 3,500 years in good condition.

=== Walled Obelisk ===
In the 10th century the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus built another obelisk at the other end of the Hippodrome. It was originally covered with gilded bronze plaques, but they were sacked by Latin troops in the Fourth Crusade. The stone core of this monument also survives, known as the Walled Obelisk.

=== Statues of Porphyrius ===
Seven statues were erected on the &quot;Spina&quot; of the Hippodrome in honour of Porphyrius the Charioteer, a legendary charioteer of the early 6th century who in his time raced for the two parties which were called &quot;Greens&quot; and &quot;Blues&quot;. None of these statues have survived. The bases of two of them have survived and are displayed in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.

== Contemporary description ==

The area is officially called Sultanahmet Square. It is maintained by the Turkish government. The course of the old racetrack has been indicated with paving, although the actual track is some below the present surface. The surviving monuments of the &quot;Spina&quot;, the two obelisks and the Serpentine Column, now sit excavated in pits in a landscaped garden.

The German Fountain (&quot;The Kaiser Wilhelm Fountain&quot;), an octagonal domed fountain in neo-Byzantine style, which was constructed by the German government in 1900 to mark the visit of the German Emperor Wilhelm II to Istanbul in 1898, is located at the northern entrance to the Hippodrome area, right in front of the Blue Mosque.

In 1855, Charles Thomas Newton, the English archaeologist who excavated Halicarnassus and Cnidus, excavated the one surviving jaw of a snake from the Serpent Column. The Hippodrome was excavated by the Director of the Istanbul Archeological Museums, archaeologist Rüstem Duyuran in 1950 and 1951. A portion of the substructures of the &quot;sphendone&quot; (the curved end) became more visible in the 1980s with the clearing of houses in the area. In 1993 an area in front of the nearby Sultanahmet Mosque (the Blue Mosque) was bulldozed in order to install a public building, uncovering several rows of seats and some columns from the Hippodrome. Investigation did not continue further, but the seats and columns were removed and can now be seen in Istanbul&#x27;s museums. It is possible that much more of the Hippodrome&#x27;s remains still lie beneath the parkland of Sultanahmet.

The Hippodrome was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 500 lira banknotes of 1953–1976.

<doc id="338652" wikidata="Q904790" url="?curid=338652" title="Richard's pipit">
<text>Richard&#x27;s pipit (Anthus richardi) is a medium-sized passerine bird which breeds in open grasslands in the East Palearctic. It is a long-distance migrant moving to open lowlands in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe.

The genus name &quot;Anthus&quot; is the Latin name for a small bird of grasslands. The English name and &quot;richardi&quot; are for the French naturalist Charles Richard (1745–1835), director of postal services at Lunéville and friend of Francois Levaillant.

It belongs to the pipit genus &quot;Anthus&quot; in the family Motacillidae. It was formerly lumped together with the Australasian, African, mountain and paddyfield pipits in a single species: Richard&#x27;s pipit, &quot;Anthus novaeseelandiae&quot;. These pipits are now commonly considered to be separate species although the African and paddyfield pipits are sometimes treated as part of &quot;A. richardi&quot;.

==Description==

This is a large pipit, 17–20 cm in length, with a weight of 25–36 g and a wingspan of 29 to 33 cm. It is a slender bird which often stands very upright. It has long yellow-brown legs, a long tail with white outer-feathers and a long dark bill with a yellowish base to the lower mandible. The hindclaw is long and fairly straight. It is an undistinguished-looking species on the ground, mainly brown above and pale below. There are dark streaks on the upperparts and breast while the belly and flanks are plain. The face is strongly marked with pale lores and supercilium and dark eyestripe, moustachial stripe and malar stripe. There are two wingbars formed by pale tips to the wing-coverts.

There is some variation between the different subspecies. &quot;A. r. sinensis&quot; is slightly smaller than the nominate race with less streaking above. &quot;A. r. centralasiae&quot; is larger with more sand-coloured upperparts. &quot;A. r. dauricus&quot; has more streaking above.

Its flight is strong and undulating, and it gives a characteristic explosive &quot;shreep&quot; call, somewhat similar to the chirp of a house sparrow. The song is a repeated series of monotonous buzzy notes given in an undulating song-flight.

Some care must be taken to distinguish this from other large pipits which winter or are resident in the area, such as Blyth&#x27;s pipit and paddyfield pipit. Blyth&#x27;s pipit has a shorter bill, legs and tail, a shorter and more curved hindclaw, less white on the tail and more streaking on the upperparts. In adult birds, the median wing-coverts have blunt-ended dark centres whereas in Richard&#x27;s pipit the dark centres become pointed towards the tip of the feather. The call of Blyth&#x27;s pipit call is quieter and less harsh. Paddyfield pipit is smaller than Richard&#x27;s pipit with a shorter bill and tail, less streaking on the breast and a quieter call.

==Distribution and habitat==
Richard&#x27;s pipit breeds in southern Siberia, Mongolia, parts of Central Asia and in northern, central and eastern China. It migrates south to winter in the Indian subcontinent and South-east Asia with records as far south as Sri Lanka, Singapore and northern Borneo. It is a scarce passage migrant in Korea and Japan. A small part of the population regularly moves west in autumn and birds have been recorded from most countries in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. It is seen annually between September and November at coastal watchpoints in areas such as Britain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia with occasional birds appearing in spring. A few overwinter in countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy and Morocco.

==Behaviour and ecology==

It is a bird of open country, particularly flat lowland areas. It inhabits grassland, steppe and cultivated land, preferring more fertile, moist habitats. In Europe it is most often recorded on headlands and islands. It occurs alone or in small groups.

Like other pipits, this species is insectivorous. It mainly feeds on the ground and will also make short flights to catch flying insects. A few seeds are also eaten.
The nest is made of grass or moss and is built on the ground under a grass tussock.

<text>Blyth&#x27;s pipit (Anthus godlewskii) is a medium-sized passerine bird which breeds in Mongolia and neighbouring areas of China, Tibet and India . It is a long distance migrant moving to open lowlands in Southern Asia. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

This is a large pipit, but is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly brown above and pale below. It is very similar to Richard&#x27;s pipit, but is slightly smaller, shorter legs and a shorter dark bill. Its flight is strong and direct, and it gives a characteristic &quot;pshee&quot; call, higher pitched than Richard&#x27;s.

In south Asia, in winter some care must be taken to distinguish this from other large pipits which winter or are resident in the area, including Richard&#x27;s. This species is insectivorous.

This bird was named after the English zoologist Edward Blyth. The genus name &quot;Anthus&quot; is the Latin name for a small bird of grasslands. The specific &quot;godlewskii&quot; commemorates Polish nobleman and field naturalist Victor Godlewski.

<text>Xinhua County () is a county and the 4th most populous county-level division in the Province of Hunan, China; it is under the administration of Loudi City.

Located along the middle reaches of the Zi River, it covers 3,635 square kilometers and has a population of 1,196,538 (November 2020). Xinhua shares the border with Lengshuijiang, Lianyuan, Xinshao, Xupu and Longhui counties and cities. As a county, it was founded in 1072 (Northern Song dynasty) and now it is under jurisdiction of the Loudi City and subdivided into 7 townships and 19 towns, Shangmei is the county seat.

The economy of Xinhua County is largely agricultural, with 741 thousand of Xinhua County&#x27;s population of 1.2 million working in agriculture. Other than agriculture, industries include machinery, electronics, ceramics, building materials, metallurgy, coal, chemical, food, paper, bamboo and wood processing. In recent years, Xinhua County&#x27;s economy has grown quite a lot.

In 2011, media attention was attracted by a construction project started by the county&#x27;s government. In the hope of attracting tourists, the officials wanted to build a lavish temple (Xiongshan Si - ), diverting funds from more essential projects.

<doc id="338677" wikidata="Q514259" url="?curid=338677" title="Isle of Purbeck">
<text>The Isle of Purbeck is a peninsula in Dorset, England. It is bordered by water on three sides: the English Channel to the south and east, where steep cliffs fall to the sea; and by the marshy lands of the River Frome and Poole Harbour to the north. Its western boundary is less well defined, with some medieval sources placing it at Flower&#x27;s Barrow above Worbarrow Bay. John Hutchins, author of &quot;The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset&quot;, defined Purbeck&#x27;s western boundary as the Luckford Lake stream, which runs south from the Frome. According to writer and broadcaster Ralph Wightman, Purbeck &quot;is only an island if you accept the barren heaths between Arish Mell and Wareham as cutting off this corner of Dorset as effectively as the sea.&quot; The most southerly point is St Alban&#x27;s Head (archaically St. Aldhelm&#x27;s Head).

From 1974 to 2019, the whole of the Isle of Purbeck lay within the local government district of Purbeck, which was named after it. The district extended significantly further north and west than the traditional boundary of the Isle of Purbeck along the River Frome. Following the abolition of the district on 1 April 2019, the Isle now lies within the Dorset unitary authority area.

In terms of natural landscape areas, the southern part of the Isle of Purbeck and the coastal strip as far as Ringstead Bay in the west, have been designated as National Character Area 136 – South Purbeck by Natural England. To the north are the Dorset Heaths and to the west, the Weymouth Lowlands.

==Geology==
The geology of the Isle is complex. It has a discordant coastline along the east and concordant coastline along the south. The northern part is Eocene clay (Barton Beds), including significant deposits of Purbeck Ball Clay. Where the land rises to the sea there are several parallel strata of Jurassic rocks, including Portland limestone and the Purbeck beds. The latter include Purbeck Marble, a particularly hard limestone that can be polished (though mineralogically, it is not marble). A ridge of Cretaceous chalk runs along the peninsula creating the Purbeck Hills, part of the Southern England Chalk Formation that includes Salisbury Plain, the Dorset Downs and the Isle of Wight. The cliffs here are some of the most spectacular in England, and of great geological interest, both for the rock types and variety of landforms, notably Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door, and the coast is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site because of the unique geology.

In the past, quarrying of limestone was particularly concentrated around the western side of Swanage, the villages of Worth Matravers and Langton Matravers, and the cliffs along the coast between Swanage and St. Aldhelm&#x27;s Head. The &quot;caves&quot; at Tilly Whim are former quarries, and Dancing Ledge, Seacombe and Winspit are other cliff-edge quarries. Stone was removed from the cliff quarries either by sea, or using horse carts to transport large blocks to Swanage. Many of England&#x27;s most famous cathedrals are adorned with Purbeck marble, and much of London was rebuilt in Portland and Purbeck stone after the Great Fire of London.

By contrast, the principal ball clay workings were in the area between Corfe Castle and Wareham. Originally the clay was taken by pack horse to wharves on the River Frome and the south side of Poole Harbour. However, in the first half of the 19th century the pack horses were replaced by horse-drawn tramways. With the coming of the railway from Wareham to Swanage, most ball clay was dispatched by rail, often to the Potteries district of Staffordshire.

Quarrying still takes place on Purbeck, with both Purbeck Ball Clay and limestones being transported from the area by road. There are now no functioning quarries of Purbeck Marble. The Purbeck Mineral and Mining Museum displays an exhibition about ball clays, mining and the associated narrow gauge railways.

==Wild flowers==

The isle has the highest number of species of native and anciently introduced wild flowers of any area of comparable size in Britain. This is largely due to the varied geology. The species most frequently sought is Early Spider Orchid (&quot;Ophrys sphegodes&quot;), which in Britain, is most common on Purbeck. Nearly 50,000 flowering spikes were counted in 2009. Late April is the best time, and the largest population is usually in the field to the west of Dancing Ledge. Smaller numbers can be seen on a shorter walk in Durlston Country Park. This orchid is the logo of the Dorset Wildlife Trust. Cowslip meadows (&quot;Primula veris&quot; and &quot;Primula deorum&quot;) are at their best shortly afterwards and Durlston Country Park has several large ones.

In early May, several woods have carpets of Wild Garlic (&quot;Allium ursinum&quot;). King&#x27;s Wood and Studland Wood, both owned by the National Trust, are good examples. At around the same time and later some Downs have carpets of yellow Horseshoe Vetch (&quot;Hippocrepis comosa&quot;) and blue Chalk Milkwort (&quot;Polygala calcarea&quot;). In late May the field near Old Harry Rocks has a carpet of yellow Kidney Vetch (&quot;Anthyllis vulneraria&quot;).

Blue and white flowers of Sheep&#x27;s bit (&quot;Jasione montana&quot;) and pink and flowers of Sea Bindweed (&quot;Calystegia soldanella&quot;) lend colour to Studland dunes in June. Both Heath Spotted Orchid (&quot;Dactylorhiza maculata&quot;) and Southern Marsh Orchid (&quot;Dactylorhiza praetermissa&quot;) are frequent on Corfe Common that month, and Harebells (&quot;Campanula rotundifolia&quot;) and Purple Betony (&quot;Stachys officinalis&quot;) flowers add colour to the Common in July.

Dorset Heath (&quot;Erica ciliaris&quot;), the county flower, can be found in July and August in large numbers, especially on and around Hartland Moor, in damper parts of the heathland. Bog Asphodel (&quot;Narthecium ossifragum&quot;) gives displays of yellow flowers there in early July. Marsh Gentian (&quot;Gentiana pneumonanthe&quot;) is found less frequently in similar areas from mid August to mid September.

==Human history==
A number of Romano-British sites have been discovered and studied on the Isle of Purbeck, including a villa at Bucknowle Farm near Corfe Castle, excavated between 1976 and 1991. The Kimmeridge shale of the isle was worked extensively during the Roman period, into jewellery, decorative panels and furniture.

At the extreme southern tip of Purbeck is St.Aldhelm&#x27;s Chapel, which is Norman work but built on a pre-Conquest Christian site marked with a circular earthwork and some graves. In 1957, the body of a 13th-century woman was found buried to the north of the chapel, suggesting there may have been a hermitage in the area. In 2000, the whole chapel site was declared a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The precise function of the chapel building is disputed, with suggestions that it may have been a religious retreat, a chantry for the souls of sailors who had drowned off St Aldhelm&#x27;s Head or even a lighthouse or warning bell to warn sailors. Victorian restoration work of the chapel found signs that a beacon may have adorned the roof. The present cross on the roof is Victorian.

The town of Wareham retains its Saxon earth embankment wall and its churches have Saxon origins. One of these, St Martins-on-the-Walls, was built in 1030 and today contains traces of medieval and later wall paintings.

The village of Corfe Castle is named after the castle that overlooks the village, commanding a strategic gap in the Purbeck Ridge. The present castle dates from after the Conquest of 1066 but may have replaced Saxon work, as the village was where Saxon King Edward the Martyr was murdered in 978. The supposed location of his murder is traditionally on or near the castle mound. Corfe was one of the first English castles to be built in stone, at a time when earth and timber were the norm. This may have been due to the plentiful supply of good building stone on Purbeck.

Sir John Bankes bought the castle in 1635 and was the owner during the English Civil War. His wife, Lady Mary Bankes, led the defence of the castle when it was twice besieged by Parliamentarian forces. The first siege, in 1643, was unsuccessful, but by 1645 Corfe was one of the last remaining royalist strongholds in southern England and fell to a siege ending in an assault. In March that year Corfe Castle was &#x27;&quot;slighted&quot; (demolished) on Parliament&#x27;s orders. Owned by the National Trust, the castle is open to the public. It is protected as a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

==Geography==

A large part of the Isle of Purbeck is within the Dorset National Landscape area. A portion of the coast around Worbarrow Bay and the ghost village of Tyneham is owned by the Ministry of Defence, who have used it as a training area since 1943. Lulworth Ranges are part of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Gunnery School at Lulworth Camp. Tanks and other armoured vehicles are used in this area and shells are fired. Due to safety reasons, right of entry is only given when the army ranges are not in operation. Large red flags are flown and flashing warning lamps on Bindon Hill and St Alban&#x27;s Head are lit when the ranges are in use.
At such times the entrance gates are locked and wardens patrol the area.

Other places of note are:
* Swanage, at the eastern end of the peninsula, is a seaside resort. At one time it was linked by a branch railway line from Wareham; this was closed in 1972, but has now partially reopened as the Swanage Railway, a heritage railway.
* Studland: This is a seaside village in its own sandy bay. Nearby, lying off-shore from The Foreland (also Handfast Point), are the chalk stacks named Old Harry Rocks: &quot;Old Harry and his Wife&quot;.
*Poole Harbour is popular with bird watchers, windsurfers and yachters; it contains Brownsea Island, the site of the first-ever Scout camp.
* Corfe Castle is in the centre of the isle, overlooking Corfe Castle village.
* Langton Matravers, which was once the home of several boys&#x27; preparatory schools; the last of these, The Old Malthouse School, closed in 2007.
* Kimmeridge Bay, with its fossil-rich Jurassic shale cliffs and the oldest continually working oil well in the UK.
* Worth Matravers: A village of stone houses around a pond, which is a regular feature on postcards of the Isle of Purbeck.

<text>Neo-Confucianism (, often shortened to &quot;lǐxué&quot; 理學, literally &quot;School of Principle&quot;) is a moral, ethical, and metaphysical Chinese philosophy influenced by Confucianism, which originated with Han Yu (768–824) and Li Ao (772–841) in the Tang dynasty, and became prominent during the Song and Ming dynasties under the formulations of Zhu Xi (1130–1200). After the Mongol conquest of China in the thirteenth century, Chinese scholars and officials restored and preserved neo-Confucianism as a way to safeguard the cultural heritage of China.

Neo-Confucianism could have been an attempt to create a more rationalist and secular form of Confucianism by rejecting mystical elements of Taoism and Buddhism that had influenced Confucianism during and after the Han dynasty. Although the neo-Confucianists were critical of Taoism and Buddhism, the two did have an influence on the philosophy, and the neo-Confucianists borrowed terms and concepts. However, unlike the Buddhists and Taoists, who saw metaphysics as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment, and immortality, the neo-Confucianists used metaphysics as a guide for developing a rationalist ethical philosophy.

==Origins==

Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the Tang dynasty; the Confucianist scholars Han Yu and Li Ao are seen as forebears of the neo-Confucianists of the Song dynasty. The Song dynasty philosopher Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073) is seen as the first true &quot;pioneer&quot; of neo-Confucianism, using Taoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy. Neo-Confucianism was both a revival of classical Confucianism, updated to align with the social values of the Song dynasty, and a reaction to the challenges of Buddhism and Taoism philosophy and religion which emerged during the Zhou and Han dynasties. Although the neo-Confucianists denounced Buddhist metaphysics, Neo-Confucianism did borrow Taoist and Buddhist terminology and concepts.

One of the most important exponents of neo-Confucianism was Zhu Xi (1130–1200), his teachings were so influential that they were integrated into civil-service examination from approximately 1314 until 1905. He was a rather prolific writer, maintaining and defending his Confucian beliefs of social harmony and proper personal conduct. One of his most remembered was the book &quot;Family Rituals&quot;, where he provided detailed advice on how to conduct weddings, funerals, family ceremonies, and the veneration of ancestors. Buddhist thought soon attracted him, and he began to argue in Confucian style for the Buddhist observance of high moral standards. He also believed that it was important to practical affairs that one should engage in both academic and philosophical pursuits, although his writings are concentrated more on issues of theoretical (as opposed to practical) significance. It is reputed that he wrote many essays attempting to explain how his ideas were not Buddhist or Taoist and included some heated denunciations of Buddhism and Taoism. After the (1068–1077), Wang Yangming (1472–1529) is commonly regarded as the most important Neo-Confucian thinker. Wang&#x27;s interpretation of Confucianism denied the rationalist dualism of Zhu&#x27;s orthodox philosophy.

There were many competing views within the neo-Confucian community, but overall, a system emerged that resembled both Buddhist and Taoist (Daoist) thought of the time and some of the ideas expressed in the I Ching (Book of Changes) as well as other yin yang theories associated with the Taiji symbol (Taijitu). A well known neo-Confucian motif is paintings of Confucius, Buddha, and Lao Tzu all drinking out of the same vinegar jar, paintings associated with the slogan &quot;The three teachings are one!&quot;

While neo-Confucianism incorporated Buddhist and Taoist ideas, many neo-Confucianists strongly opposed Buddhism and Taoism. Indeed, they rejected the Buddhist and Taoist religions. One of Han Yu&#x27;s most famous essays decries the worship of Buddhist relics. Nonetheless, neo-Confucian writings adapted Buddhist thoughts and beliefs to the Confucian interest. In China, neo-Confucianism was an officially recognized creed from its development during the Song dynasty until the early twentieth century, and lands in the sphere of Song China (Vietnam, Korea, and Japan) were all deeply influenced by neo-Confucianism for more than half a millennium.

==Philosophy==
Neo-Confucianism is a social and ethical philosophy using metaphysical ideas, some borrowed from Taoism, as its framework. The philosophy can be characterized as humanistic and rationalistic, with the belief that the universe could be understood through human reason, and that it was up to humanity to create a harmonious relationship between the universe and the individual.

The rationalism of neo-Confucianism is in contrast to the mysticism of the previously dominant Chan Buddhism. Unlike the Buddhists, the neo-Confucians believed that reality existed, and could be understood by humankind, even if the interpretations of reality were slightly different depending on the school of neo-Confucianism.

The importance of &quot;li&quot; in Neo-Confucianism gave the movement its Chinese name, literally &quot;The study of Li&quot;.

In the view of Neo-Confucians, the true form of Confucianism had been lost after Mencius as &quot;later&quot; Confucians were more concerned with the vehicles of knowledge such as Classics or literary writing rather than the &quot;values that all should share,&quot; They claimed that &quot;later&quot; Confucians focused on correct governance (found in the canonical texts) to the exclusion of &quot;correct learning,&quot; the necessary basis for moral order. Their ideal of moral order, which could be inculcated by scholars outside of government, stood in contrast with previous ideas of moral instruction by ruling authorities. Neo-Confucians could be distinguished by their stronger concern with personal ethics and morals. Politically, Neo-Confucians also opposed centralization in the imperial court and instead argued for more local autonomy and the creation of lateral, community-centred institutions for social improvement. These voluntary local literati organizations focused on local education and local relief instead of aligning with the requirements of government service or government officials. The growing numbers of literati who did not serve in government but saw themselves as the equals of officials, capable of bottom-up collective action, constrained the authority of the local officials.

==Schools==
Neo-Confucianism was a heterogeneous philosophical tradition, and is generally categorized into two different schools.

===Two-school model vs. three-school model===
In medieval China, the mainstream of neo-Confucian thought, dubbed the &quot;Tao school&quot;, had long categorized a thinker named Lu Jiuyuan among the unorthodox, non-Confucian writers. However, in the 15th century, the esteemed philosopher Wang Yangming took sides with Lu and critiqued some of the foundations of the Tao school, albeit not rejecting the school entirely. Objections arose to Yangming&#x27;s philosophy within his lifetime, and shortly after his death, Chen Jian (1497–1567) grouped Wang together with Lu as unorthodox writers, dividing neo-Confucianism into two schools. As a result, neo-Confucianism today is generally categorized into two different schools of thought. The school that remained dominant throughout the medieval and early modern periods is called the Cheng–Zhu school for the esteem it places in Cheng Yi, Cheng Hao, and Zhu Xi. The less dominant, opposing school was the Lu–Wang school, based on its esteem for Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming.

In contrast to this two-branch model, the New Confucian Mou Zongsan argues that there existed a third branch of learning, the Hu-Liu school, based on the teachings of Hu Hong (Hu Wufeng, 1106–1161) and Liu Zongzhou (Liu Jishan, 1578–1645). The significance of this third branch, according to Mou, was that they represented the direct lineage of the pioneers of neo-Confucianism, Zhou Dunyi, Zhang Zai and Cheng Hao. Moreover, this third Hu-Liu school and the second Lu–Wang school, combined, form the true mainstream of neo-Confucianism instead of the Cheng–Zhu school. The mainstream represented a return to the teachings of Confucius, Mengzi, the Doctrine of the Mean and the Commentaries of the Book of Changes. The Cheng–Zhu school was therefore only a minority branch based on the Great Learning and mistakenly emphasized intellectual studies over the study of sagehood.

===Cheng–Zhu school===
Zhu Xi&#x27;s formulation of the neo-Confucian world view is as follows. He believed that the Tao () of Tian () is expressed in principle or &quot;li&quot; (), but that it is sheathed in matter or &quot;qi&quot; (). In this, his system is based on Buddhist systems of the time that divided things into principle (again, li), and function (). In the neo-Confucian formulation, &quot;li&quot; in itself is pure and almost-perfect, but with the addition of &quot;qi&quot;, base emotions and conflicts arise. Human nature is originally good, the neo-Confucians argued (following Mencius), but not pure unless action is taken to purify it. The imperative is then to purify one&#x27;s &quot;li&quot;. However, in contrast to Buddhists and Taoists, neo-Confucians did not believe in an external world unconnected with the world of matter. In addition, neo-Confucians in general rejected the idea of reincarnation and the associated idea of karma.

Different neo-Confucians had differing ideas for how to do so. Zhu Xi believed in &quot;gewu&quot; (), the Investigation of Things, essentially an academic form of observational science, based on the idea that &quot;li&quot; lies within the world.

===Lu–Wang school===
Wang Yangming (Wang Shouren), probably the second most influential neo-Confucian, came to another conclusion: namely, that if &quot;li&quot; is in all things, and &quot;li&quot; is in one&#x27;s heart-mind, there is no better place to seek than within oneself. His preferred method of doing so was &quot;jingzuo&quot; (), a practice that strongly resembles Chan (Zen) meditation, or &quot;zuochan&quot; (; ). Wang Yangming developed the idea of &quot;innate knowing&quot;, arguing that every person knows from birth the difference between good and evil. Such knowledge is intuitive and not rational. These revolutionizing ideas of Wang Yangming would later inspire prominent Japanese thinkers like Motoori Norinaga, who argued that because of the Shinto deities, Japanese people alone had the intuitive ability to distinguish good and evil without complex rationalization. Wang Yangming&#x27;s school of thought (&quot;Ōyōmei-gaku&quot; in Japanese) also provided, in part, an ideological basis for some samurai who sought to pursue action based on intuition rather than scholasticism. As such, it also provided an intellectual foundation for the radical political actions of low ranking samurai in the decades prior to the Meiji Restoration (1868), in which the Tokugawa shogunate (1600–1868) was overthrown.

==In Korea==

In Joseon Korea, neo-Confucianism was established as the state ideology. The Yuan occupation of the Korean Peninsula introduced Zhu Xi&#x27;s school of neo-Confucianism to Korea. Neo-Confucianism was introduced to Korea by An Hyang during the Goryeo dynasty. At the time that he introduced neo-Confucianism, the Goryeo dynasty was in the last century of its existence and influenced by the Mongol Yuan dynasty.

Many Korean scholars visited China during the Yuan era and An was among them. In 1286, he read a book of Zhu Xi in Yanjing and was so moved by it that he transcribed the book in its entirety and came back to Korea with it. It greatly inspired Korean intellectuals at the time and many, predominantly from the middle class and disillusioned with the excesses of organized religion (namely Buddhism) and the old nobility, embraced neo-Confucianism. The newly rising neo-Confucian intellectuals were leading groups aimed at the overthrow of the old (and increasingly foreign-influenced) Goryeo dynasty.

After the fall of Goryeo and the establishment of the Joseon dynasty by Yi Song-gye in 1392, neo-Confucianism was installed as the state ideology. Buddhism, and organized religion in general, was considered poisonous to the neo-Confucian order. Buddhism was accordingly restricted and occasionally persecuted by Joseon. As neo-Confucianism encouraged education, a number of neo-Confucian schools (서원 &quot;seowon&quot; and 향교 &quot;hyanggyo&quot;) were founded throughout the country, producing many scholars including Jo Gwang-jo (조광조, 趙光祖; 1482–1520), Yi Hwang (이황, 李滉; pen name Toegye 퇴계, 退溪; 1501–1570) and Yi I (이이, 李珥; 1536–1584).

In the early 16th century, Jo attempted to transform Joseon into an ideal neo-Confucian society with a series of radical reforms until he was executed in 1520. Despite this, neo-Confucianism soon assumed an even greater role in the Joseon dynasty. Soon neo-Confucian scholars, no longer content to only read and remember the Chinese original precepts, began to develop new neo-Confucian theories. Yi Hwang and Yi I were the most prominent of these new theorists.

Yi Hwang&#x27;s most prominent disciples were Kim Seong-il (金誠一, 1538–1593), Yu Sŏngnyong (1542–1607) and Jeong Gu (한강 정구, 寒岡 鄭逑, 1543–1620), known as the &quot;three heroes&quot;. They were followed by a second generation of scholars who included Jang Hyungwang (張顯光, 1554–1637) and Jang Heunghyo (敬堂 張興孝, 1564–1633), and by a third generation (including Heo Mok, Yun Hyu, Yun Seon-do and Song Si-yeol) who brought the school into the 18th century 

But neo-Confucianism became so dogmatic in a relatively rapid time that it prevented much needed socioeconomic development and change, and led to internal divisions and criticism of many new theories regardless of their popular appeal. For instance, Wang Yangming&#x27;s theories, which were popular in the Chinese Ming dynasty, were considered heresy and severely condemned by Korean neo-Confucianists. Furthermore, any annotations on Confucian canon different from Zhu Xi were excluded. Under Joseon, the newly emerging ruling class called &quot;Sarim&quot; (사림, 士林) also split into political factions according to their diversity of neo-Confucian views on politics. There were two large factions and many subfactions.

During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), many Korean neo-Confucian books and scholars were taken to Japan and influenced Japanese scholars such as Fujiwara Seika and affected the development of Japanese neo-Confucianism.

==In Japan==

==In Vietnam==

In 1070, emperor Lý Thánh Tông opened first Confucius university in Hanoi named &quot;Văn Miếu&quot;. The Lý, Trần court expanded the Confucianism influences in Vietnamese Mandarin through year examinations, continued the model of Tang dynasty until being annexed by the Ming invaders in 1407. In 1460, emperor Lê Thánh Tông of Lê dynasty adopted Neo-Confucianism as Đại Việt&#x27;s basic values.

==Bureaucratic examinations==
Neo-Confucianism became the interpretation of Confucianism whose mastery was necessary to pass the bureaucratic examinations by the Ming, and continued in this way through the Qing dynasty until the end of the Imperial examination system in 1905. However, many scholars such as Benjamin Elman have questioned the degree to which their role as the orthodox interpretation in state examinations reflects the degree to which both the bureaucrats and Chinese gentry actually believed those interpretations, and point out that there were very active schools such as Han learning which offered competing interpretations of Confucianism.

The competing school of Confucianism was called the Evidential School or Han Learning and argued that neo-Confucianism had caused the teachings of Confucianism to be hopelessly contaminated with Buddhist thinking. This school also criticized neo-Confucianism for being overly concerned with empty philosophical speculation that was unconnected with reality.

==Confucian canon==
The Confucian canon as it exists today was essentially compiled by Zhu Xi. Zhu codified the canon of Four Books (the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius, and the &quot;Mencius&quot;) which in the subsequent Ming and Qing dynasties were made the core of the official curriculum for the civil service examination.

==New Confucianism==
In the 1920s, New Confucianism, also known as modern neo-Confucianism, started developing and absorbed the Western learning to seek a way to modernize Chinese culture based on the traditional Confucianism. It centers on four topics: The modern transformation of Chinese culture; Humanistic spirit of Chinese culture; Religious connotation in Chinese culture; and Intuitive way of thinking, to go beyond the logic and to wipe out the concept of exclusion analysis. Adhering to the traditional Confucianism and the neo-confucianism, the modern neo-Confucianism contributes the nation&#x27;s emerging from the predicament faced by the ancient Chinese traditional culture in the process of modernization; furthermore, it also promotes the world culture of industrial civilization rather than the traditional personal senses.

<doc id="338683" wikidata="Q1636805" url="?curid=338683" title="Humberside">
<text>Humberside () was a non-metropolitan and ceremonial county in Northern England from 1 April 1974 until 1 April 1996. It was composed of land from either side of the Humber, created from portions of the East Riding of Yorkshire, West Riding of Yorkshire, and the northern part of Lindsey, Lincolnshire. The county council&#x27;s headquarters was County Hall at Beverley, inherited from East Riding County Council. Its largest settlement and only city was Kingston upon Hull. Other notable towns included Goole, Beverley, Scunthorpe, Grimsby, Cleethorpes and Bridlington. The county stretched from Wold Newton at its northern tip to a different Wold Newton at its southernmost point.

Humberside bordered North Yorkshire to the north and west, South Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire to the south-west, and Lincolnshire to the south. It faced east towards the North Sea.

On 1 April 1996, Humberside was abolished, and replaced with four unitary authority areas: North Lincolnshire, North East Lincolnshire, Kingston upon Hull, and East Riding of Yorkshire. The name has continued in use as a geographical term, mainly in the media, and in the names of institutions such as Humberside Police and Humberside Fire and Rescue Service. These institutions did not change their names mainly due to costs. There were proposals to merge the police force with other Yorkshire forces and then change all the forces&#x27; names accordingly. However, these proposals were later ruled out.

Humber Enterprise Zone was launched in 2012 to encourage industrial development at 16 sites around the estuary.

==Name==

The name &quot;Humberside&quot; was very rarely used, as an informal name and a geographical term, for the area surrounding the Humber before the creation of the ceremonial county. However, by the mid-20th century the industrial development of both sides of the Humber Estuary was becoming increasingly integrated, and &quot;Humberside&quot; was being widely applied to the ports of Hull, Grimsby and Goole and their hinterland. The use of the term to unify the two sides of the river was also driven by the desire of the local authorities in the area to promote the construction of a suspension bridge.

Unlike &quot;Merseyside&quot;, which was used colloquially, &quot;Humberside&quot; was adopted as an official term in 1964, when the planning region of Yorkshire and The Humber was created. It consisted of the majority of the former East Riding of Yorkshire and some eastern parts of the former West Riding of Yorkshire and Parts of Lindsey from Lincolnshire. From that time onwards &quot;Humberside&quot; was actively used to market the area. In 1971 the newly launched local BBC radio station was named Radio Humberside, but since the abolition of the county the broadcasters have referred to people of East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire.

==Formation==

The county was created under the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974. It covered the former county boroughs of Grimsby and Kingston upon Hull. From Lindsey it incorporated the boroughs of Cleethorpes and Scunthorpe, the urban districts of Barton-upon-Humber and Brigg, and the rural districts of Glanford Brigg, Grimsby and the Isle of Axholme. From the East Riding it took the boroughs of Beverley, Bridlington and Hedon, the urban districts of Driffield, Haltemprice, Hornsea and Withernsea, and the rural districts of Beverley, Bridlington (part), Driffield, Holderness, Howden and Pocklington. From the West Riding it took both the borough of Goole and the rural district of Goole.

The Redcliffe-Maud Report that preceded the Local Government Act 1972 had not proposed any directly analogous area. Instead it proposed making the part north of the Humber one unitary authority, and the part south of it another. The White Paper that followed the Report did not include a cross-Humber authority either, having named the northern part &quot;East Yorkshire&quot; and kept the southern area in Lincolnshire. Humberside had emerged in the Local Government Bill as introduced to Parliament, which also gave it its name for the first time.

Paul Bryan, the MP for Howden, moved an amendment to the Bill that would have created a county of East Yorkshire, covering the rural area of northern Humberside along with Selby and York (and also Flaxton Rural District), leaving a Humberside including Haltemprice, Hull, Grimsby, Scunthorpe and Goole, while Cleethorpes and Grimsby Rural District would have been kept in Lincolnshire. The amendment was rejected by the House.

At this time there was very little connecting its two parts, aside from ferries and a circuitous journey via Goole (a road journey from Grimsby to Beverley, the headquarters, being something just under 100 miles). It was promised by the government that the Humber Bridge would make it a more viable unit. By 1975 the bridge was planned to open in 1977. The bridge was finally opened on 24 June 1981, providing a permanent link between North and South, and cutting the journey from Grimsby to Beverley to a mere 30 or so miles, but it did not secure Humberside&#x27;s future.

==Governance==

Humberside was a non-metropolitan county governed by Humberside County Council and 9 non-metropolitan district councils. Elections to the county council took place every four years, with the first election taking place in 1973 and the final elections taking place in 1993.

==Districts==
The county was divided into nine non-metropolitan districts:


#North Wolds, renamed East Yorkshire in 1981
#Holderness
#Kingston upon Hull
#Beverley, renamed East Yorkshire Borough of Beverley in 1981
#Boothferry
#Scunthorpe
#Glanford
#Grimsby, renamed Great Grimsby in 1979
#Cleethorpes
==Coat of arms==
Humberside County Council held a competition to design a coat of arms for the new county. The winning design was by a Mr E. H. Cook from Thorngumbald. Letters patent granting the arms were issued by the College of Arms on 28 July 1976.

The shield formed an heraldic map of the county. At the top was a gold ducal coronet from the arms of the city of Hull between two white Yorkshire roses, while at the bottom of the shield were two gold fleurs-de-lis representing Lincolnshire. Across the centre of the shield was a blue and silver wave for the River Humber.

The crest was a blue eagle, taken from the arms of the former East Riding County Council, rising phoenix-like from flames, suggesting a new authority emerging from the ashes of the old. The eagle&#x27;s wings bore gold droplets standing for North Sea Oil and held in its beak a sword representing the Scunthorpe steel industry.

The supporters on either side were a silver dolphin bearing a terrestrial globe and supporting an anchor, representing worldwide trade; and Ceres, goddess of harvests, for the county&#x27;s agriculture. They stood upon a compartment depicting the countryside and coastline of Humberside.

The blazon (technical description) of the arms is:
&quot;Per fess Sable and Gules on a Fess wavy Argent between in chief a Coronet Or between two Roses Argent barbed and seeded proper and in base two Fleurs de Lis Or a Bar wavy Azure and for a Crest on a Wreath Or and Gules rising from Flames proper a demi-Eagle Azure Goutté d&#x27;Or armed also Gold holding in the beak a Sword point downwards proper hilt and pommel Or.&quot;
&quot;And for Supporters on the dexter a Dolphin Argent finned Or charged on the shoulder with a Terrestrial Globe Azure the land masses Or supporting an Anchor proper and on the sinister a Female Figure habited representing Ceres with Cornucopia all proper upon a Compartment per pale Water barry wavy Azure and Argent and a Grassy Field proper.&quot;

The motto was &quot;United We Flourish&quot;.

On the abolition of the county council in 1996 the arms became obsolete. However, the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service continues to use a version of the shield as its badge.

==Abolition==

Humberside was not well-loved: to quote James Cran, MP for Beverley, &quot;almost the day after the decision was announced a campaign began to have Humberside abolished&quot;. North Wolds Borough Council changed its name to East Yorkshire Borough Council and Beverley Borough Council formally included &quot;East Yorkshire&quot; in its name. According to Cran, there was a campaign in 1987 to get Humberside County Council to change its name to something like &quot;East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire&quot;. The county&#x27;s boundary signs, particularly in the East Riding of Yorkshire, continually suffered vandalism, to the extent that Humberside County Council had boundary signs reading &quot;Welcome to England&#x27;s Newest County&quot; removed in 1990 to deter vandals and save costs on producing replacement signs.

This attitude was reported as less common in the port towns of the county. For example, &quot;The Times&quot; noted in 1974 that Hull and Grimsby &quot;regard the advantages of unification as an exciting prospect&quot;.

In 1982 the Local Government Boundary Commission for England advised the Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, that &quot;a review of the Humberside county boundary [was] warranted&quot;. The Local Government Boundary Commission reviewed the existence of Humberside from 1985 to 1988, but found that &quot;Humberside County Council could not be shown to have failed&quot;. In 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment called for a further review, which resulted in a proposal made in November 1990 to transfer the four districts south of the Humber to the non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire, which would have left the remaining part north of the Humber free to change its name to include &quot;Yorkshire&quot;. A report prepared for the Commission in 1990 indicated that 63 per cent of respondents thought that the creation of Humberside was &quot;bad&quot; and only 14 per cent thought that it was &quot;good&quot;.

However, before the proposal could be implemented, a general local government review for England was announced. This was conducted with an eye to creating unitary authorities, and Humberside was one of the areas that the commission was expecting &quot;early wins&quot; in, and was in the first tranche of reviews. The Commission recommended that the county and its districts be abolished and replaced with four unitary authorities, a proposal that the government accepted. The Order for abolition and replacement was debated in the House of Commons on 28 February 1995 and in the House of Lords on 6 March 1995, and it came into effect on 1 April 1996.

There were questions raised as to whether the boundaries of Hull should be expanded, given that they had been set many decades before and never altered despite continuous urbanisation in the neighbouring area, the former urban district of Haltemprice).

Michael Brown, the Conservative MP for Brigg and Cleethorpes, was particularly vociferous in support of the Order, saying in the debate regarding abolition: &quot;I want to see the word &#x27;Humberside&#x27; expunged from the English language&quot;.

Few voices were heard in defence of Humberside. Elliot Morley, Labour MP for Glanford and Scunthorpe, claimed that &quot;young people who were born in Humberside and have an affinity with Humberside identify with it,&quot; but he agreed that the council was a &quot;flawed idea&quot;.

The abolition of the county thus resulted in four successor unitary authorities:

*Kingston upon Hull
*East Riding of Yorkshire: Beverley, East Yorkshire, Holderness, and northern Boothferry
*North Lincolnshire: Glanford, Scunthorpe and southern Boothferry
*North East Lincolnshire: Great Grimsby, Cleethorpes

There was some debate as to the fate of Goole and the surrounding area, historically part of the West Riding. The Secretary of State, John Gummer, initially proposed that Goole should be &quot;incorporated in Selby of North Yorkshire&quot;, but it was decided to associate it with the rest of North Humberside.

The offices of Lord Lieutenant of Humberside and High Sheriff of Humberside were also abolished. The Yorkshire part became the ceremonial county of the East Riding of Yorkshire, which includes Hull, while the Lincolnshire part reverted to Lincolnshire for ceremonial purposes. The whole of the area once covered by the former non-metropolitan county of Humberside, including the Lincolnshire parts, is part of the government office region of Yorkshire and the Humber (originally Yorkshire and Humberside).

==Postal counties==
The Royal Mail did not adopt Humberside as a postal county, instead dividing the area into North Humberside and South Humberside for purposes of directing mail with effect from 1 July 1975. 
Under the Royal Mail&#x27;s &quot;flexible addressing policy&quot;, in force since 1996, users may add a county – not necessarily the (former) Postal County – to an address as long as the post town and postcode are included, but it is not required to include one. The policy allows for the use of either the &quot;former postal&quot;, &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;administrative&quot; county. The Postcode Address File Code of Practice does not allow for changes in the former postal county. In 2008 the Postal Services Commission (Postcomm) announced that it was holding a public consultation into the code. Accordingly, local council leaders and members of parliament asked that Postcomm recommend the deletion of North and South Humberside from postal databases. The recommendations were expected to be issued in late summer 2009 and a decision made by the end of the year.
in August 2013 local MP Graham Stuart brought the issue back to the fore when joint submissions and pleas from other MPs and councillors across the area for the term &#x27;Humberside&#x27; to be dropped were made to PostComm. Graham Stuart stating &quot;We are proud to live in the East Riding of Yorkshire, not Humberside.

The campaign was stepped up on 22 November 2013 after MP Graham Stuart stated that the head of the newly privatised Royal Mail had refused to meet him to discuss the matter. A new sticker campaign was launched which encouraged people to return any mail which was incorrectly addressed.

On 2 October 2014 the Royal Mail agreed to remove Humberside from its databases following residents continued protests taken up by Graham Stuart. Royal Mail&#x27;s CEO Moya Greene stated &quot;Royal Mail can confirm the technical change required to suppress the automatic reference to North and South Humberside as a Former Postal County on postcode address file products supplied to customers was implemented from July as part of a pilot scheme. &quot;This now means no former postal county details will be shown for all postcodes previously tagged with a Humberside reference.

Finally more than 18 years after the county was abolished &#x27;Humberside&#x27; as a postal destination ceased to exist.

==Legacy==
Despite the county&#x27;s abolishment, the term &quot;Humberside&quot; has not fallen out of use as a geographic designation within some organisations. On 2 October 2014, following the Royal Mail&#x27;s decision to remove Humberside from its address database, the BBC came under public pressure to remove the name from its website and its local radio station. Both the police and the fire service stated that the reason for not pursuing a name change was cost in the present economic environment. There is still a Humberside Police (and a Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner), a Humberside Airport (roughly halfway between Scunthorpe and Grimsby), a Humberside Fire Service, Humberside Scouts and BBC Radio Humberside (founded in 1971).

===Hull and Humber Ports city region===
The former Humberside county was also the basis for the Hull and Humber Ports City Region, an area whose economic development is supported by the Humber Economic Partnership (HEP), a sub-regional economic development partnership. This sub-region comprises the four districts of the former county of Humberside. The City Region has a population of 887,500, of whom 380,000 work in 30,000 businesses. It is one of eight city regions defined in the 2004 document &quot;Moving Forward: The Northern Way&quot;, a collaboration between the three northern Regional Development Agencies which is a part of the 20 year government strategy to grow the economy of Northern England. The Hull and Humber Ports City Region Development Plan vision for the City region is of a global gateway with a thriving, outward-looking sustainable economy building on its unique assets of location, the estuary, ports connectivity, and physical environment.

====Enterprise zone====
Humber Enterprise Zone, an enterprise zone initiated by Humber Local Enterprise Partnership, was announced by the government in 2011, and launched in April 2012. It contains 16 sites around the Humber Estuary, with a total area of . The zone has a focus on marine engineering and offshore, renewable energy, and was designed in two tiers.

<doc id="338686" wikidata="Q7722457" url="?curid=338686" title="The Children's Encyclopædia">
<text>The Children&#x27;s Encyclopædia was an encyclopaedia originated by Arthur Mee, and published by the Educational Book Company, a subsidiary of Northcliffe&#x27;s Amalgamated Press, London. It was published from 1908 to 1964. Walter M. Jackson&#x27;s company Grolier acquired the rights to publish it in the U.S. under the name The Book of Knowledge (1910).

==Contents==
The encyclopaedia was originally published in fortnightly parts between March 1908 and February 1910. Some readers could have bound their collections, but the first eight-volume sets were published in 1910. Each section contained a variety of articles, developing topics as it progressed. The work could be used as a conventional reference library, as the last volume had an alphabetical index, or each section could be read from start to finish. It was originally organised into sections but there were changes in subsequent editions. Some titles covered scientific subjects such as geology, biology and astronomy but such scientific terms were generally avoided.

* Familiar Things, by &quot;many writers&quot;
* Wonder, by the Wise Man
* Nature, by Ernest Bryant and Edward Step
* The Child&#x27;s Own Life, by Dr. Caleb Saleeby
* The Earth, by Dr. Caleb Saleeby
* All Countries, by Frances Epps
* Great Lives, by &quot;many writers&quot;
* Golden Deeds, by &quot;many writers&quot;
* Bible Stories, by Harold Begbie
* Famous Books, by John Hammerton
* Stories, by Edward Wright
* Poetry, by John Hammerton
* &quot;School Lessons&quot;, by several writers, including Lois Mee, Arthur&#x27;s sister
* Things To Make and Things To Do, by &quot;many writers&quot;

Mee wrote an introduction called a &quot;Greeting&quot; and a &quot;farewell&quot;. He took a strong interest in the &quot;Book of Wonder&quot;, in which the Wise Man answered questions posed by children.

The illustrations were mostly anonymous but some illustrators included Susan Beatrice Pearse, C. E. Brock, Thomas Maybank, George F. Morrell, Dudley Heath, Charles Folkard, H. R. Millar, Alexander Francis Lydon, Arthur A. Dixon and Arthur Rackham. The books used photographs by Frank Hinkins, engravings, maps and graphics.

The encyclopaedia broke ground in the approach to education, aiming to make learning interesting and enjoyable. Its articles were clearly written and intended to develop character and sense of duty.

The articles expressed pride for Great Britain and its empire. Christianity was held to be the only true religion. Europeans were clearly the most advanced and there were hints of the eugenic ideas of Caleb Saleeby. This was presented in a moderate and liberal way in many areas: other &quot;races&quot;, although inferior according to the text, were to be treated with respect, and imperialism was justified only if it improved the lot of its subjects. At a time when the relation between science and religion was controversial, the encyclopaedia supported evolution and it did not see any contradiction between religious teachings and Darwin&#x27;s views.

==Distribution==
It was widely sold. It was used by schools and for teacher training. It gives insight into the social values of the society that created it. As the initial run ended, it was reissued as the monthly New Children&#x27;s Encyclopædia. The title changed, becoming Children&#x27;s Encyclopædia Magazine, Children&#x27;s Magazine and, finally, &quot;My Magazine&quot; in 1914. From September 1910, the magazine included a supplement of news entitled &quot;The Little Paper&quot;, the forerunner of Arthur Mee&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Newspaper&quot;, launched in 1919.

==Editions==
&quot;The Children&#x27;s Encyclopædia&quot; sold 800,000 copies in 12 editions before being extensively revised in the early 1920s. The new 59-part, 7,412-page, 10-volume series debuted in October 1922 as &quot;The Children&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;, the digraph having been dropped, and went through 14 editions by 1946 under the imprint of The Educational Book Co. Translations appeared in France, Italy, Spain, Brazil and China.

New editions of the encyclopaedia continued after Mee&#x27;s death in 1943; the final, much revised, edition, still entitled &quot;Arthur Mee&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;, appeared in 1964.

While the encyclopaedia itself did not carry any copyright or publishing dates, clues are present in the title used and the colour and design on the cover as to the approximate age of a complete collection. The initial release of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Encyclopædia&quot; featured the spelling &quot;Encyclopædia&quot; and was initially an 8 volume collection, bound in brown. All other revisions used the spelling &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; and were a 10 volume collection. 1920 versions have blue binding. By the 1940s the binding is brown in colour, and displays a flaming torch on each book&#x27;s spine. By the 1950s, the binding is red. There is also at least one green bound version that dates from the 1920s. One edition with a red binding and art deco patterning on the spine dates to the mid 1930s.

In the mid-1960s the Library of Congress reported only the 1925 edition in 10 volumes and another edition in 1953, though a 1960 printing under the Waverley Book Company imprint was recorded as being the 28th edition. It was apparently also published under the names Harmsworth&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Encyclopedia and Mee&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Encyclopedia.

The set was bought out by the Grolier Society in 1963, when it was announced that the encyclopaedia would be phased out by 1970.

== Kashmir riots ==
In May 1973 riots occurred in Jammu and Kashmir, India, in an area where the Jamaat-e-Islami was gaining influence, sparked by the discovery that an illustration contained in &quot;The Book of Knowledge&quot;, which had been stored in a local library for decades, portrayed the Archangel Gabriel dictating portions of the Quran to Muhammad. Muslims offended by a visual depiction of Muhammad caused riots which left four dead and over a hundred wounded. The sale of the encyclopedia was then banned, although it was already out of print by that time.

<text>Context awareness refers, in information and communication technologies, to a capability to take into account the &quot;situation&quot; of &quot;entities&quot;, which may be users or devices, but are not limited to those. &quot;Location&quot; is only the most obvious element of this &quot;situation&quot;. Narrowly defined for mobile devices, context awareness does thus generalize location awareness. Whereas location may determine how certain processes around a contributing device operate, context may be applied more flexibly with mobile users, especially with users of smart phones. Context awareness originated as a term from ubiquitous computing or as so-called pervasive computing which sought to deal with linking changes in the environment with computer systems, which are otherwise static. The term has also been applied to business theory in relation to contextual application design and business process management issues.

== Qualities of context ==
Various categorizations of context have been proposed in the past. Dey and Abowd (1999) distinguish between the context types &quot;location&quot;, &quot;identity&quot;, &quot;activity&quot; and &quot;time&quot;. Kaltz et al. (2005) identified the categories &quot;user&amp;role&quot;, &quot;process&amp;task&quot;, &quot;location&quot;, &quot;time&quot; and &quot;device&quot; to cover a broad variety of mobile and web scenarios. They emphasize yet for these classical modalities that any optimal categorization depends very much on the application domain and use case. Beyond more advanced modalities may apply when not only single entities are addressed, but also clusters of entities that work in a coherence of context, as e.g. teams at work or also single bearers with a multiplicity of appliances.

Some classical understanding of context in business processes is derived from the definition of AAA applications with the following three categories:
* Authentication, which means i.e. confirmation of stated identity
* Authorisation, which means i.e. allowance to accrual or access to location, function, data
* Accounting, which means i.e. the relation to order context and to accounts for applied labour, granted license, and delivered goods,
these three terms including additionally location and time as stated.

== Computer science ==
In computer science &quot;context awareness&quot; refers to the idea that computers can both sense, and react based on their environment. Devices may have information about the circumstances under which they are able to operate and based on rules, or an intelligent stimulus, react accordingly. The term &quot;context awareness&quot; in ubiquitous computing was introduced by Schilit (1994). 
Context-aware devices may also try to make assumptions about the user&#x27;s current situation. Dey (2001) define context as &quot;any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.&quot;

While the computer science community initially perceived the context as a matter of user location, as Dey discuss, in the last few years this notion has been considered not simply as a state, but part of a process in which users are involved; thus, sophisticated and general context models have been proposed (see survey), to support context-aware applications which use them to (a) adapt interfaces, (b) tailor the set of application-relevant data, (c) increase the precision of information retrieval, (d) discover services, (e) make the user interaction implicit, or (f) build smart environments.
For example: a context-aware mobile phone may know that it is currently in the meeting room, and that the user has sat down. The phone may conclude that the user is currently in a meeting and reject any unimportant calls.

Context-aware systems are concerned with the acquisition of context (e.g. using sensors to perceive a situation), the abstraction and understanding of context (e.g. matching a perceived sensory stimulus to a context), and application behaviour based on the recognized context (e.g. triggering actions based on context).
As the user&#x27;s activity and location are crucial for many applications, context awareness has been focused more deeply in the research fields of location awareness and activity recognition.

Context awareness is regarded as an enabling technology for ubiquitous computing systems.
Context awareness is used to design innovative user interfaces, and is often used as a part of ubiquitous and wearable computing. It is also beginning to be felt in the internet with the advent of hybrid search engines.
Schmidt, Beigl and Gellersen
define &quot;human factors&quot; and &quot;physical environment&quot; as two important aspects relating to computer science. More recently, much work has also been done to ease the &quot;distribution of context information&quot;; Bellavista, Corradi, Fanelli and Foschini survey the several middleware solutions that have been designed to transparently implement context management and provisioning in the mobile system. Grifoni, D&#x27;Ulizia and Ferri provided a review of several context-aware location-based service systems using big data by analysing the methodological and practical choices that their developers made during the main phases of the context awareness process (i.e. context acquisition, context representation, and context reasoning and adaptation). Perera, Zaslavsky, Christen, and Georgakopoulos have performed a comprehensive survey on context-aware computing from Internet of Things perspective by reviewing over 50 leading projects in the field. Further, Perera has also surveyed a large number of industrial products in the existing IoT marketplace from context-aware computing perspective. Their survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for context-aware product development and research in the IoT paradigm. The evaluation has been done using the theoretical framework developed by Dey and Abowd (1999) more than a decade ago. The combination of the Internet and emerging technologies transform everyday objects into smart objects that can understand and react to their contexts.

Human factors related context is structured into three categories: information on the user (knowledge of habits, emotional state, biophysiological conditions), the user&#x27;s social environment (co-location of others, social interaction, group dynamics), and the user&#x27;s tasks (spontaneous activity, engaged tasks, general goals). Likewise, context related to physical environment is structured into three categories: location (absolute position, relative position, ), infrastructure (surrounding resources for computation, communication, task performance), and physical conditions (noise, light, pressure, air quality).

== Relational context: dynamic and non-user-centric definitions==
Whereas early definitions of context tended to center on users, or devices interfaced directly with users, the oft-cited definition from Dey (&quot;any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity&quot;) could be taken without this restriction. User-centric context, as may be used in the design of human-computer interfaces, may also imply an overly clearcut, and partially arbitrary, separation between &quot;content&quot; (anything which is &quot;explicitly&quot; typed in by users, or output to them), and context, which is &quot;implicit&quot;, and used for adaptation purposes. A more dynamic and de-centered view, advocated by Dourish views context as primarily &quot;relational&quot;. This was originally congruent with the move from desktop computing to ubiquitous computing, but it does also fit with a broader understanding of ambient intelligence where the distinctions between &quot;context&quot; and &quot;content&quot; become relative and dynamic. In this view, whichever sources of information (such as IoT sensors) may be &quot;context&quot; for some uses and applications, might also be sources of primary &quot;content&quot; for others, and vice versa. What matters is the set of &quot;relationships&quot; that link them, together and with their environment. Whereas early descriptions of single-user-centric context could fit with classical entity-attribute-value models, more versatile graph-based information models, such as proposed with NGSI-LD, are better adapted to capture the more relational view of context which is relevant for the Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems and Digital Twins. In this broader acceptation, context is not only represented as a set of attributes attached to an entity, it is also captured by a graph that enmeshes this entity with others. Context awareness is the capability to account for this cross-cutting information from different sources.

== Applications in situational or social awareness ==
Context awareness has been applied to the area of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) to help individuals work and collaborate more efficiently with each other. Since the early 1990s, researchers have developed a large number of software and hardware systems that can collect contextual information (e.g., location, video feeds, away status messages) from users. This information is then openly shared with other users, thereby improving their situational awareness, and allowing them to identify natural opportunities to interact with each other. In the early days of context-aware computing, many of the systems developed for this purpose were specifically designed to assist businesses or geographically separated work teams collaborate on shared documents or work artifacts. More recently, however, there has been a growing body of work that demonstrates how this technique can also be applied to groups of friends or family members to help keep them apprised of each other&#x27;s activities.

To date, systems that use context awareness to improve situational awareness can be characterised by:
* the context(s) that they collect from each user, and 
* the method by which they convey this information to other users

The most common context to obtain and share for the purposes of improving situational awareness is the user&#x27;s location. In an early prototype, the Active Badge system, for example, each user had a uniquely identifying badge that could be tracked via a series of overhead infrared sensors. As users walked throughout a building, their location was constantly monitored by a centralized server. Other users could then view this information (either in text form, or on a map, as was done in later work) to determine if a user is in her office, thereby allowing them to determine the best time to stop by for an unplanned conversation. Location was also shared in the PeopleTones, Serendipity, and the Group Interaction Support Systems to help users determine when they are near friends, users with shared personal interests, and teammates, respectively. In comparison with Active Badge, which only displays location information, these systems are more proactive, and will alert the users when they are in proximity of each other. This lets the user know when a potential interaction opportunity is available, thereby increasing his/her chances of taking advantage of it.

Another popular context to share is a user&#x27;s work activity, often by sharing video. In the Community Bar system, researchers developed a desktop application that periodically took screenshots of the user&#x27;s display. This information was then shared with the user&#x27;s co-workers so that they could know what documents/artifacts their teammates was working on, and provided a common frame of reference so that users could n talk about these artifacts as if they were collocated. In Montage, users are given the ability to remotely activate the webcam on another user&#x27;s computer for a brief amount of time. This capability to &quot;glance&quot; at another user lets users see if they are busy or preoccupied, which in turn helps them better determine the most opportune time to initiate a conversation.

A third type of context to share to improve or enhance situational awareness is the user&#x27;s audio. In the Thunderwire system, researchers developed an audio-only media space that allowed friends to share raw audio from their mobile devices&#x27; microphones. This system, which in essence was a perpetual conference-call, allowed users to listen to other users&#x27; audio in order to determine if and when they were participating in a conversation. The WatchMe and ListenIn systems also rely heavily on audio in order to determine if and when a user was potentially interruptible. Unlike Thunderwire, however, these systems rely on machine learning algorithms in order to analyze the user&#x27;s audio and determine if the user is talking. This allows the system to provide other users with the same context (i.e., whether or not the user is in a conversation) without having to share the actual audio, thereby making it more privacy centric.

A fourth type of context that is commonly shared is the user&#x27;s overall activity. In the Hubbub and Conchat systems, researchers developed a series of instant messenger applications that monitored when the user was active or idle using either software, or environmental sensors, respectively. This information could then be provided to other users to let them know if and when their friends were available to respond to their messages. In the Digital Family Portrait system, researchers developed a digital picture frame that provides qualitative visualizations of a user&#x27;s (i.e., an elderly parent/grandparent) daily activities. This visualization is then provided to the user&#x27;s adult children so that they could &quot;check up&quot; on their parents without having to explicitly bother them, thereby allowing them to &quot;age in place.&quot;

Although these system demonstrate how context awareness can be used to support situational and social awareness, the long term effectiveness of these systems are not yet fully understood. Many of the systems described above have only been evaluated at a conceptual level, or to demonstrate that the system is technically feasible. Consequently, while initial results from these studies suggest that context awareness can support situational awareness tasks, more longitudinal data is required.

== Application in health care ==
Context-aware mobile agents are a best suited host implementing any context-aware applications. Modern integrated voice and data communications equips the hospital staff with smart phones to communicate vocally with each other, but preferably to look up the next task to be executed and to capture the next report to be noted.

However, all attempts to support staff with such approaches are hampered till failure of acceptance with the need to look up upon a new event for patient identities, order lists and work schedules. Hence a well suited solution has to get rid of such manual interaction with a tiny screen and therefore serves the user with

* automated identifying actual patient and local environment upon approach,
* automated recording the events with coming to and leaving off the actual patient,
* automated presentation of the orders or service due on the current location and with
* supported documentation to provide such qualities for EHR.

==Applications in industrial production==

Context-aware mobile agents are a well suited host implementing newer context-aware applications in relation to the new paradigm with industry 4.0. Modern integrated (voice and) data communications equips the workshop or production line staff with smart phones to communicate data with production control for feedback, where data originates from detecting and identifying components and parts to get integrated in flexible production management for on-demand products.

However, all attempts to support staff with such approaches are hampered by fixed production schedules unless the information for customer demand and product configuration can be matched with parts supply. Hence a well suited solution has to get rid of missing interaction of production plan and production line occurrence of relevant information and material by means of

* automated identifying actually available parts delivered from stock or out of buffer supplies,
* automated presenting of the integration requirements for on-demand configuration,
* automated detecting and reporting of the actually mounted configuration
The key requirement is to implement a solution free from manual interaction of worker with information handling. Otherwise the error rate will rise with the rise in information requirements.

Additionally, none of the conventional RFID, WLAN or RTLS locating solutions advertising for most precise locating serve the required quality, as determining a location in conventional attitude looking for absolute coordinates fails either technically or economically. Other approaches based on fuzzy locating promise better return on investment.

==Applications in pervasive games==

A pervasive game is leveraging the sensed human contexts to adapt game system behaviors. By blending of real and virtual elements and enabling users to physically interact with their surroundings during the play, people can become fully involved in and attain better gaming experience. For example, a pervasive game that uses the contexts of human activity and location in smart homes is reported by an autonomous agent.

==Applications in mobile multimedia devices==
Museums and archaeological sites sometimes provide multimedia mobile devices as an alternative to the conventional audio guide (see e.g. the Tate Modern in London. A context aware device will use the location, current user interactions and the graph of connected objects to dynamically tailor the information presented to the user. In some cases this is combined with real-time navigation around the site to guide the user to artefacts or exhibits that are likely to be of interest, based on the user&#x27;s previous interactions.

<text>Master of the Mint is a title within the Royal Mint given to the most senior person responsible for its operation. It was an office in the governments of Scotland and England, and later Great Britain and then the United Kingdom, between the 16th and 19th centuries. Until 1699, the appointment was usually for life. Its holder occasionally sat in the cabinet.

During the interregnum (1643–1660), the last Master of the Mint to Charles I, Sir Robert Harley, transferred his allegiance to Parliament and remained in office. After his death in 1656 Aaron Guerdon was appointed.

In 1870 the role was amalgamated into the office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, making the Chancellor, by virtue of their position, the Master of the Mint. The duty of running the mint was given to the Deputy Master of the Mint; who is now the mint&#x27;s Chief Executive.

<doc id="338698" wikidata="Q6488533" url="?curid=338698" title="Treasurer of the Navy">
<text>The Treasurer of the Navy, originally called Treasurer of Marine Causes or Paymaster of the Navy, was a civilian officer of the Royal Navy, one of the principal commissioners of the Navy Board responsible for naval finance from 1524 to 1832. The treasurer was based at the Navy Pay Office.

==History==
Originally established in 1524, the first holder of the post was William Gonson; he held the office for twenty years until 1544. Although a member of the board, his office was semi-autonomous. The office-holder was responsible for the direction and control of the finance of the Royal Navy. The office was a political appointment and frequently was held by up-and-coming young politicians who would later go on to hold more important positions. Before 1832 all accounts were dealt with by a number of different offices and officials. The Treasurer of the Navy originated during the reign of Henry VIII. He was the senior member of the Navy Board responsible for all Navy accounts; he gradually withdrew during the seventeenth century from the board&#x27;s day-to-day affairs and his office, and the Navy Pay Office, came to be regarded as entirely separate from the Navy Office. The Treasurer of the Navy survived the re-organisational changes of 1832, but the office was abolished in 1835 and its duties were transferred to the Paymaster General&#x27;s&#x27; Office.

==Treasurers of the Navy 1524–1836==
Notable holders of this post included:
==Departments and offices under Treasurer==
Included:
* Navy Pay Office (1546–1832) This was in effect the larger part of the Treasurer of the Navy’s Department.
* Department of the Accountant-General of the Navy (1829–1832)

<text>Addison&#x27;s disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is a rare long-term endocrine disorder characterized by inadequate production of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone by the two outer layers of the cells of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex), causing adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms generally come on slowly and insidiously and may include abdominal pain and gastrointestinal abnormalities, weakness, and weight loss. Darkening of the skin in certain areas may also occur. Under certain circumstances, an adrenal crisis may occur with low blood pressure, vomiting, lower back pain, and loss of consciousness. Mood changes may also occur. Rapid onset of symptoms indicates acute adrenal failure, which is a clinical emergency. An adrenal crisis can be triggered by stress, such as from an injury, surgery, or infection.
Addison&#x27;s disease arises when the adrenal gland does not produce sufficient amounts of the steroid hormones cortisol and (sometimes) aldosterone. It is an autoimmune disease which affects some genetically predisposed people in whom the body&#x27;s own immune system has started to target the adrenal glands. In many adult cases it is unclear what has triggered the onset of this disease, though it sometimes follows tuberculosis. Causes can include certain medications, sepsis, and bleeding into both adrenal glands. Addison&#x27;s disease is generally diagnosed by blood tests, urine tests, and medical imaging.
Treatment involves replacing the absent or low hormones. This involves taking a synthetic corticosteroid, such as hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone. These medications are typically taken orally. Lifelong, continuous steroid replacement therapy is required, with regular follow-up treatment and monitoring for other health problems which may occur. A high-salt diet may also be useful in some people. If symptoms worsen, an injection of corticosteroid is recommended (people need to carry a dose with them at all times). Often, large amounts of intravenous fluids with the sugar dextrose are also required. With appropriate treatment, the overall outcome is generally favorable, and most people are able to lead a reasonably normal life. Without treatment, an adrenal crisis can result in death.
Addison&#x27;s disease affects about 9 to 14 per 100,000 people in the developed world. It occurs most frequently in middle-aged females. The disease is named after Thomas Addison, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School, who first described the condition in 1855.

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms of Addison&#x27;s disease can develop over several months and resemble other medical conditions. Most common symptoms are caused by low levels of hormones that would normally be produced by the adrenal glands. Low blood cortisol can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, malaise, muscle and joint pain, reduced appetite, weight loss, and increased sensitivity to cold. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting are particularly common. Low aldosterone can cause affected people to crave salty foods, as well as develop low blood pressure that leads to dizziness upon standing. In women, low dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can result in dry and itchy skin, loss of armpit and pubic hair, and reduced sexual drive. Young children with Addison&#x27;s disease may have insufficient weight gain and recurrent infections. Low cortisol also interferes with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) regulation, sometimes resulting in the darkening of the skin and mucous membranes, particularly in areas exposed to sun or regular friction.

Blood tests in people with Addison&#x27;s disease often reveal low blood sodium. Many also have high blood potassium and/or high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Most people with Addison&#x27;s disease develop or have a preexisting autoimmune disease. Particularly common comorbid conditions are autoimmune thyroid disease (40% of people with Addison&#x27;s), premature ovarian failure (up to 16% of people with Addison&#x27;s), type 1 diabetes (11%), pernicious anemia (10%), vitiligo (6%) and celiac disease (2%). The combination of Addison&#x27;s disease in addition to mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, or both, is called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1. The presence of Addison&#x27;s in addition to autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, or both, is called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2.

=== Adrenal crisis ===
An &quot;adrenal crisis&quot; or &quot;Addisonian crisis&quot; is a constellation of symptoms that indicates severe adrenal insufficiency. This may be the result of either previously undiagnosed Addison&#x27;s disease, a disease process suddenly affecting adrenal function (such as adrenal hemorrhage), or an intercurrent problem (e.g., infection, trauma) in someone known to have Addison&#x27;s disease. It is a medical emergency and potentially life-threatening situation requiring immediate emergency treatment.

Characteristic symptoms are:
* Sudden penetrating pain in the legs, lower back, or abdomen
* Severe vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in dehydration
* Low blood pressure
* Syncope (loss of consciousness and ability to stand)
* Hypoglycemia (reduced level of blood glucose)
* Confusion, psychosis, slurred speech
* Severe lethargy
* Hyponatremia (low sodium level in the blood)
* Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium level in the blood)
* Hypercalcemia (elevated calcium level in the blood)
* Convulsions
* Fever

== Causes ==
Causes of adrenal insufficiency can be categorized by the mechanism through which they cause the adrenal glands to produce insufficient cortisol. This can be due to damage or destruction of the adrenal cortex. These deficiencies include glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones as well. These are adrenal dysgenesis (the gland has not formed adequately during development), impaired steroidogenesis (the gland is present but is biochemically unable to produce cortisol), or adrenal destruction (disease processes leading to glandular damage).

Darkening (hyperpigmentation) of the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun – characteristic sites of darkening are skin creases (e.g., of the hands), nipple, and the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa); also, old scars may darken. This occurs because melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and ACTH share the same precursor molecule, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). After production in the anterior pituitary gland, POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH, ACTH, and beta-lipotropin. The subunit ACTH undergoes further cleavage to produce alpha-MSH, the most important MSH for skin pigmentation. In secondary and tertiary forms of adrenal insufficiency, skin darkening does not occur, as ACTH is not overproduced.

===Adrenal destruction===
Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of Addison&#x27;s disease in the industrialized world as it represents between 68% and 94% of cases. Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex is caused by an immune reaction against the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (a phenomenon first described in 1992). This may be isolated or in the context of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS type 1 or 2), in which other hormone-producing organs, such as the thyroid and pancreas, may also be affected.

Adrenal destruction is also a feature of adrenoleukodystrophy, and when the adrenal glands are involved in metastasis (seeding of cancer cells from elsewhere in the body, especially lung), hemorrhage (e.g., in Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome or antiphospholipid syndrome), particular infections (tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis), or the deposition of abnormal protein in amyloidosis.

===Adrenal dysgenesis===
All causes in this category are genetic, and generally very rare. These include mutations to the &quot;SF1&quot; transcription factor, congenital adrenal hypoplasia due to &quot;DAX-1&quot; gene mutations and mutations to the ACTH receptor gene (or related genes, such as in the Triple-A or Allgrove syndrome). &quot;DAX-1&quot; mutations may cluster in a syndrome with glycerol kinase deficiency with a number of other symptoms when &quot;DAX-1&quot; is deleted together with a number of other genes.

===Impaired steroidogenesis===
To form cortisol, the adrenal gland requires cholesterol, which is then converted biochemically into steroid hormones. Interruptions in the delivery of cholesterol include Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome and abetalipoproteinemia. Of the synthesis problems, congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the most common (in various forms: 21-hydroxylase, 17α-hydroxylase, 11β-hydroxylase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), lipoid CAH due to deficiency of StAR and mitochondrial DNA mutations. Some medications interfere with steroid synthesis enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole), while others accelerate the normal breakdown of hormones by the liver (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin).

== Diagnosis ==

=== Suggestive features ===
Routine laboratory investigations may show:
* Low blood sugar (worse in children due to loss of glucocorticoid&#x27;s glucogenic effects)
* Low blood sodium, due to loss of production of the hormone aldosterone, to the kidney&#x27;s inability to excrete free water in the absence of sufficient cortisol, and also the effect of corticotropin-releasing hormone to stimulate secretion of ADH.
* High blood potassium, due to loss of production of the hormone aldosterone.
* Eosinophilia and lymphocytosis (increased number of eosinophils or lymphocytes, two types of white blood cells)
* Metabolic acidosis (increased blood acidity), also is due to loss of the hormone aldosterone because sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule is linked with acid/hydrogen ion (H+) secretion. Absent or insufficient levels of aldosterone stimulation of the renal distal tubule lead to sodium wasting in the urine and H+ retention in the serum.

===Testing===

In suspected cases of Addison&#x27;s disease, demonstration of low adrenal hormone levels even after appropriate stimulation (called the ACTH stimulation test or synacthen test) with synthetic pituitary ACTH hormone tetracosactide is needed for the diagnosis. Two tests are performed, the short and the long test. Dexamethasone does not cross-react with the assay and can be administered concomitantly during testing.

The short test compares blood cortisol levels before and after 250 micrograms of tetracosactide (intramuscular or intravenous) is given. If one hour later, plasma cortisol exceeds 170 nmol/L and has risen by at least 330 nmol/L to at least 690 nmol/L, adrenal failure is excluded. If the short test is abnormal, the long test is used to differentiate between primary adrenal insufficiency and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.

The long test uses 1 mg tetracosactide (intramuscular). Blood is taken 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours later. Normal plasma cortisol level should reach 1,000 nmol/L by 4 hours. In primary Addison&#x27;s disease, the cortisol level is reduced at all stages, whereas in secondary corticoadrenal insufficiency, a delayed but normal response is seen. Other tests may be performed to distinguish between various causes of hypoadrenalism, including renin and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, as well as medical imaging – usually in the form of ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

Adrenoleukodystrophy, and the milder form, adrenomyeloneuropathy, cause adrenal insufficiency combined with neurological symptoms. These diseases are estimated to be the cause of adrenal insufficiency in about 35% of diagnosed males with idiopathic Addison&#x27;s disease and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any male with adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis is made by a blood test to detect very long-chain fatty acids.

== Treatment ==

=== Maintenance ===
Treatment for Addison&#x27;s disease involves replacing the missing cortisol, sometimes in the form of hydrocortisone tablets, or prednisone tablets in a dosing regimen that mimics the physiological concentrations of cortisol. Alternatively, one-quarter as much prednisolone may be used for equal glucocorticoid effect as hydrocortisone. Treatment is usually lifelong. In addition, many people require fludrocortisone as a replacement for the missing aldosterone.

People with Addison&#x27;s are often advised to carry information on them (e.g., in the form of a MedicAlert bracelet or information card) for the attention of emergency medical services personnel who might need to attend to their needs. A needle, syringe, and injectable form of cortisol are also recommended to be carried for emergencies. People with Addison&#x27;s disease are advised to increase their medication during periods of illness or when undergoing surgery or dental treatment. Immediate medical attention is needed when severe infections, vomiting, or diarrhea occur, as these conditions can precipitate an Addisonian crisis. A person who is vomiting may require injections of hydrocortisone, instead.

Those with low aldosterone levels may also benefit from a high-sodium diet. It may also be beneficial for the people with Addison&#x27;s disease to increase their dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D. High dosages of corticosteroids are linked to osteoporosis so these may be necessary for bone health. Sources of calcium include dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified flours among many others. Vitamin D can be obtained through the sun, oily fish, red meat, and egg yolks among many others. Though there are many sources to obtain vitamin D through diet, supplements are also an option.

===Crisis===
Standard therapy involves intravenous injections of glucocorticoids and large volumes of intravenous saline solution with dextrose (glucose). This treatment usually brings rapid improvement. If intravenous access is not immediately available, intramuscular injection of glucocorticoids can be used. When the person is capable of swallowing fluids and medications by mouth, the amount of glucocorticoids is decreased until a maintenance dose is reached. If aldosterone is deficient, maintenance therapy also includes oral doses of fludrocortisone acetate.

==Prognosis==
Outcomes are typically good when treated. Most people can expect to live relatively normal lives. Someone with the disease should be observant of symptoms of an &quot;Addison&#x27;s crisis&quot; while the body is strained, as in rigorous exercise or being sick, the latter often needing emergency treatment with intravenous injections to treat the crisis.

Individuals with Addison&#x27;s disease have more than a doubled mortality rate. Furthermore, individuals with Addison&#x27;s disease and diabetes mellitus have an almost four-fold increase in mortality compared to individuals with only diabetes. The risk ratio for cause mortality in males and females is 2.19 and 2.86, respectively.

Death for individuals with Addison&#x27;s disease often occurs due to cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, and malignant tumors, among other possibilities.

== Epidemiology ==
The frequency rate of Addison&#x27;s disease in the human population is sometimes estimated at one in 100,000. Some put the number closer to 40–144 cases per million population (1/25,000–1/7,000). Addison&#x27;s can affect persons of any age, sex, or ethnicity, but it typically presents in adults between 30 and 50 years of age. Research has shown no significant predispositions based on ethnicity. About 70% of Addison&#x27;s disease diagnoses occur due to autoimmune reactions, which cause damage to the adrenal cortex.

==History==
Addison&#x27;s disease is named after Thomas Addison, the British physician who first described the condition in &quot;On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsules&quot; (1855). He originally described it as &quot;melasma suprarenale&quot;, but later physicians gave it the medical eponym &quot;Addison&#x27;s disease&quot; in recognition of Addison&#x27;s discovery.

While the six under Addison in 1855 all had adrenal tuberculosis, the term &quot;Addison&#x27;s disease&quot; does not imply an underlying disease process.

The condition was initially considered a form of anemia associated with the adrenal glands. Because little was known at the time about the adrenal glands (then called &quot;Supra-Renal Capsules&quot;), Addison&#x27;s monograph describing the condition was an isolated insight. As the adrenal function became better known, Addison&#x27;s monograph became known as an important medical contribution and a classic example of careful medical observation. Tuberculosis used to be a major cause of Addison&#x27;s disease and acute adrenal failure worldwide. It remains a leading cause in developing countries today.

US president John F. Kennedy (1917–1963) suffered from complications of Addison&#x27;s disease throughout his life, including during his presidency, resulting in fatigue and hyperpigmentation of the face. He is possibly the most famous known case.

== Other animals ==

Hypoadrenocorticism is uncommon in dogs, and rare in cats, with less than 40 known feline cases worldwide, since first documented in 1983. Individual cases have been reported in a grey seal, a red panda, a flying fox, and a sloth.

In dogs, hypoadrenocorticism has been diagnosed in many breeds. Vague symptoms, which wax and wane, can cause delay in recognition of the presence of the disease. Female dogs appear more affected than male dogs, though this may not be the case in all breeds. The disease is most often diagnosed in dogs that are young to middle-aged, but it can occur at any age from 4 months to 14 years. Treatment of hypoadrenocorticism must replace the hormones (cortisol and aldosterone) which the dog cannot produce itself. This is achieved either by daily treatment with fludrocortisone, or monthly injections with desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP) and daily treatment with a glucocorticoid, such as prednisone. Several follow-up blood tests are required so the dose can be adjusted until the dog is receiving the correct amount of treatment, because the medications used in the therapy of hypoadrenocorticism can cause excessive thirst and urination if not prescribed at the lowest effective dose. In anticipation of stressful situations, such as staying in a boarding kennel, dogs require an increased dose of prednisone. Lifelong treatment is required, but the prognosis for dogs with hypoadrenocorticism is very good.

Hypoadrenocorticism can also occur in cats but is extremely rare. It is usually caused by an immune reaction, resulting in adrenal insufficiency. An ACTH stimulation test is used to diagnosis the condition.

<text>The scientific community is a diverse network of interacting scientists. It includes many &quot;sub-communities&quot; working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant. Objectivity is expected to be achieved by the scientific method. Peer review, through discussion and debate within journals and conferences, assists in this objectivity by maintaining the quality of research methodology and interpretation of results.

==History of scientific communities==

The eighteenth century had some societies made up of men who studied nature, also known as natural philosophers and natural historians, which included even amateurs. As such these societies were more like local clubs and groups with diverse interests than actual scientific communities, which usually had interests on specialized disciplines. Though there were a few older societies of men who studied nature such as the Royal Society of London, the concept of scientific communities emerged in the second half of the 19th century, not before, because it was in this century that the language of modern science emerged, the professionalization of science occurred, specialized institutions were created, and the specialization of scientific disciplines and fields occurred.

For instance, the term &quot;scientist&quot; was first coined by the naturalist-theologian William Whewell in 1834 and the wider acceptance of the term along with the growth of specialized societies allowed for researchers to see themselves as a part of a wider imagined community, similar to the concept of nationhood.

==Membership, status and interactions==

Membership in the community is generally, but not exclusively, a function of education, employment status, research activity and institutional affiliation. Status within the community is highly correlated with publication record, and also depends on the status within the institution and the status of the institution. Researchers can hold roles of different degrees of influence inside the scientific community. Researchers of a stronger influence can act as mentors for early career researchers and steer the direction of research in the community like agenda setters. 
Scientists are usually trained in academia through universities. As such, degrees in the relevant scientific sub-disciplines are often considered prerequisites in the relevant community. In particular, the PhD with its research requirements functions as a marker of being an important integrator into the community, though continued membership is dependent on maintaining connections to other researchers through publication, technical contributions, and conferences. After obtaining a PhD an academic scientist may continue through being on an academic position, receiving a post-doctoral fellowships and onto professorships. Other scientists make contributions to the scientific community in alternate ways such as in industry, education, think tanks, or the government.

Members of the same community do not need to work together. Communication between the members is established by disseminating research work and hypotheses through articles in peer reviewed journals, or by attending conferences where new research is presented and ideas exchanged and discussed. There are also many informal methods of communication of scientific work and results as well. And many in a coherent community may actually &quot;not&quot; communicate all of their work with one another, for various professional reasons.

==Speaking for the scientific community==

Unlike in previous centuries when the community of scholars were all members of few learned societies and similar institutions, there are no singular bodies or individuals which can be said today to speak for all science or all scientists. This is partly due to the specialized training most scientists receive in very few fields. As a result, many would lack expertise in all the other fields of the sciences. For instance, due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals. However, there are still multiple societies and academies in many countries which help consolidate some opinions and research to help guide public discussions on matters of policy and government-funded research. For example, the United States&#x27; National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Society sometimes act as surrogates when the opinions of the scientific community need to be ascertained by policy makers or the national government, but the statements of the National Academy of Science or the Royal Society are not binding on scientists nor do they necessarily reflect the opinions of every scientist in a given community since membership is often exclusive, their commissions are explicitly focused on serving their governments, and they have never &quot;shown systematic interest in what rank-and-file scientists think about scientific matters&quot;. Exclusivity of membership in these types of organizations can be seen in their election processes in which only existing members can officially nominate others for candidacy of membership. It is very unusual for organizations like the National Academy of Science to engage in external research projects since they normally focus on preparing scientific reports for government agencies. An example of how rarely the NAS engages in external and active research can be seen in its struggle to prepare and overcome hurdles, due to its lack of experience in coordinating research grants and major research programs on the environment and health.

Nevertheless, general scientific consensus is a concept which is often referred to when dealing with questions that can be subject to scientific methodology. While the consensus opinion of the community is not always easy to ascertain or fix due to paradigm shifting, generally the standards and utility of the scientific method have tended to ensure, to some degree, that scientists agree on some general corpus of facts explicated by scientific theory while rejecting some ideas which run counter to this realization. The concept of scientific consensus is very important to science pedagogy, the evaluation of new ideas, and research funding. Sometimes it is argued that there is a closed shop bias within the scientific community toward new ideas. Protoscience, fringe science, and pseudoscience have been topics that discuss demarcation problems. In response to this some non-consensus claims skeptical organizations, not research institutions, have devoted considerable amounts of time and money contesting ideas which run counter to general agreement on a particular topic.

Philosophers of science argue over the epistemological limits of such a consensus and some, including Thomas Kuhn, have pointed to the existence of scientific revolutions in the history of science as being an important indication that scientific consensus can, at times, be wrong. Nevertheless, the sheer explanatory power of science in its ability to make accurate and precise predictions and aid in the design and engineering of new technology has ensconced &quot;science&quot; and, by proxy, the opinions of the scientific community as a highly respected form of knowledge both in the academy and in popular culture.

===Political controversies===

The high regard with which scientific results are held in Western society has caused a number of political controversies over scientific subjects to arise. An alleged conflict thesis proposed in the 19th century between religion and science has been cited by some as representative of a struggle between tradition and substantial change and faith and reason.. A popular example used to support this thesis is when Galileo was tried before the Inquisition concerning the heliocentric model. The persecution began after Pope Urban VIII permitted Galileo to write about the Copernican model. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot; which caused great offense to him. Even though many historians of science have discredited the conflict thesis it still remains a popular belief among many including some scientists. In more recent times, the creation–evolution controversy has resulted in many religious believers in a supernatural creation to challenge some naturalistic assumptions that have been proposed in some of the branches of scientific fields such as evolutionary biology, geology, and astronomy. Although the dichotomy seems to be of a different outlook from a Continental European perspective, it does exist. The Vienna Circle, for instance, had a paramount (i.e. symbolic) influence on the semiotic regime represented by the Scientific Community in Europe.

In the decades following World War II, some were convinced that nuclear power would solve the pending energy crisis by providing energy at low cost. This advocacy led to the construction of many nuclear power plants, but was also accompanied by a global political movement opposed to nuclear power due to safety concerns and associations of the technology with nuclear weapons. Mass protests in the United States and Europe during the 1970s and 1980s along with the disasters of Chernobyl and Three Mile Island led to a decline in nuclear power plant construction.

In the last decades or so, both global warming and stem cells have placed the opinions of the scientific community in the forefront of political debate.

<text>A conference is a meeting, often lasting a few days, which is organized on a particular subject, or to bring together people who have a common interest. Conferences can be used as a form of group decision-making, although discussion, not always decisions, is the primary purpose of conferences. The term derives from the word &quot;confer&quot;.

== History ==
The first known use of &quot;conference&quot; appears in 1527, meaning &quot;a meeting of two or more persons for discussing matters of common concern&quot;. It came from the word &quot;confer&quot;, which means &quot;to compare views or take counsel&quot;. 
However the idea of a conference far predates the word. Arguably, as long as there have been people, there have been meetings and discussions between people. Evidence of ancient forms of conference can be seen in archaeological ruins of common areas where people would gather to discuss shared interests such as &quot;hunting plans, wartime activities, negotiations for peace or the organisation of tribal celebrations&quot;. 

Since the 1960s, conferences have become a lucrative sector of the tourism industry and have evolved into hundred billion Pound per year industry on a global scale. The growth around the world, including in Great Britain, Germany, Philippines, United States and Australia, has led to conferences themselves becoming an industry with buyers, suppliers, marketing, branding and conference facilities. 

Modern conferences can be held to discuss a variety of topics, from politics, to science or sport. Many conferences are held on a regular periodic basis, such as annually, biannually (twice per year), or biennially (every other year).

With the development of communications technology, conference holders have the choice of replacing the physical meeting space with a telephonic or virtual form of meeting. This has resulted in terms such as a conference call or video conference.

== Conference types ==
Conferences can have various formats, topics and intentions. 

=== Conference formats ===
* Conference call, in telecommunications, a call with more than two participants at the same time
* Conference hall, room where conferences are held
* Video conference, with the reception and transmission of audio-video signals by users at different locations

=== Conferences topics ===
* Academic conference, in science and academic, a formal event where researchers present results, workshops, and other activities
* Annual conferences within Methodism, the governing structure of certain Methodist churches; despite the name, these are not individual events
* Athletic conference, a competitive grouping of teams, often geographical
* Authors&#x27; conference, or writers&#x27; conference, where writers gather to review their written works and suggest improvements
* Parent–teacher conference, a meeting with a child&#x27;s teacher to discuss grades and school performance
* Peace conference, a diplomatic meeting to end conflict
* Press conference, an announcement to the press (print, radio, television) with the expectation of questions, about the announced matter
* Professional conference, a meeting of professionals in a given subject or profession dealing with related matters or developments
* Settlement conference, a meeting between the plaintiff and the respondent in a lawsuit, wherein they try to settle their dispute without proceeding to trial
* Trade fair, or trade conference
* Unconference or open space conference, a participant-driven meeting that tries to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional conference

<text>Robert Foster Bennett (September 18, 1933 – May 4, 2016) was an American politician and businessman who served as a United States Senator from Utah from 1993 to 2011. A member of the Republican Party, Bennett held chairmanships and senior positions on various key Senate committees, including the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee; Appropriations Committee; Rules and Administration Committee; Energy and Natural Resources Committee; and Joint Economic Committee.

Bennett was a popular and reliably conservative senator for most of his tenure, earning high ratings from conservative activist groups such as the NRA Political Victory Fund, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the American Conservative Union. However, in 2010, Bennett became one of the most prominent targets of the Tea Party Movement, which criticized his support of the Bush Administration&#x27;s bank bailout and argued that Bennett was insufficiently conservative. Despite an enthusiastic endorsement from Mitt Romney, Bennett was denied a place on the primary ballot by the 2010 Utah State Republican Convention, placing third behind two Tea-Party-backed candidates.

Following his exit from the Senate, Bennett joined the law firm Arent Fox as senior policy advisor. He also became Chairman of Bennett Group, a consulting firm with offices in Salt Lake City and Washington, D.C., and announced his intention to become a registered lobbyist in early 2013, after being out of office for the legally required two years. He served as a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, where he focused on budget, energy, and health issues. Bennett was also a part-time teacher, researcher, and lecturer at the University of Utah&#x27;s Hinckley Institute of Politics and was a fellow at the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs. He was a member of the board of the German Marshall Fund.

==Early life, education, and business career==

Born on September 18, 1933, in Salt Lake City, Utah, Bennett was the son of Frances Marion (née Grant) and the U.S. Senator Wallace Foster Bennett, as well as a grandson of Heber J. Grant, the seventh president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and a great-grandson of Jedediah M. Grant (Heber J. Grant&#x27;s father) and Daniel H. Wells (through Heber J. Grant&#x27;s wife Emily H. Wells), early mayors of Salt Lake City and counselors in the First Presidency of the LDS Church.

Bennett attended high school at East High, and he earned his B.S. from the University of Utah in 1957 majoring in Political Science. He also served as the Student Body President at the University of Utah and was initiated into Owl and Key. After graduation in 1957, Bennett joined the Utah Army National Guard and spent six months on active duty. Upon his return, he was commissioned a Chaplain in the Guard and served until 1960. He was employed at Bennett&#x27;s, a family paint and glass business, until 1962, when he left to work full-time on his father&#x27;s re-election campaign.

In 1963 he went to Washington as press secretary to a Utah Congressman, Sherman P. Lloyd, and later as administrative assistant to his father. He became the head of the Governmental Affairs office of the J. C. Penney Company in 1965 but resigned from Penney&#x27;s to accept an appointment in the Nixon Administration, as Director of Congressional Affairs in the United States Department of Transportation. He held this position through 1969 and 1970, leaving in 1971 to purchase the Robert Mullen Company, a Washington, D.C., public-relations company. While at Mullen, Bennett was chair of several dummy committees that funneled corporate donations into Nixon&#x27;s 1972 re-election campaign

Bennett&#x27;s principal client was the CIA-aligned Summa Corporation, the holding company of billionaire Howard Hughes. In 1974, after his CIA ties and those of the Mullen Company had been revealed by the Watergate scandal, he closed the Company and joined Summa full-time as the public relations director for the parent firm and Vice President for Public Affairs for Hughes Airwest, the airline. After Hughes&#x27; death, Bennett left Summa Corporation to become president of Osmond Communications.

He subsequently became chairman of American Computer Corporation, and then president of the Microsonics Corporation, a public firm listed on NASDAQ. In 1984, Bennett was named as the CEO of the Franklin International Institute, a startup that produced Franklin Day Planners and grew into Franklin Quest, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1992. After being named Entrepreneur of the Year for the Rocky Mountain Region by Inc. Magazine, he stepped down as CEO in 1991, prior to his run for the Senate.

==U.S. Senate (1993–2011)==
===Elections===
A Senate seat opened up in 1992, when Jake Garn declined to enter the race for a fourth term. Bennett narrowly won the heavily contested Republican Party primary election (with 51% of the votes cast) in 1992, his primary opponent being Joseph A. Cannon, another millionaire with prominent LDS forebears. Bennett then went on to defeat his Democratic opponent, Congressman Wayne Owens, in the general election. He was re-elected in 1998 and 2004. His Democratic opponent in 2004 was the former state Attorney General Paul Van Dam, and Bennett won by a vote total of 68% to 29%.

Bennett was challenged by seven other Republicans and two Democrats in his bid for re-election in 2010, including Mike Lee, Cherilyn Eagar, Tim Bridgewater, and Democrats Sam Granato and Christopher Stout. Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff dropped out of the race, citing family concerns.

Despite a strong approval rating among statewide voters, Bennett was defeated on May 8, 2010, at the Utah Republican Convention after finishing third in the second round of balloting, to Mike Lee and Tim Bridgewater.

After the convention, Senator Bennett was widely encouraged by his constituents and colleagues to pursue a write-in bid to retain his U.S. Senate seat, but ultimately declined, citing the toxic atmosphere such a bid would bring to the state&#x27;s political environment.

===Tenure===
During the 106th Congress, Bennett was tapped by then Majority Leader, Bill Frist, to serve as the Chief Deputy Republican Party &quot;Whip&quot;. Later, as Counsel to Mitch McConnell, Senator Bennett was an influential member of the Republican Leadership Team and advised the Minority Leader on &quot;legislative strategy and policy priorities&quot;.

====Abortion====
Bennett was a strong opponent of abortion and supported measures to restrict it. These included requirements of parental notification for one to take place and bans on allowing minors to cross state lines to obtain the procedure and late-term abortions. He showed some support, however, for embryonic stem cell research.

====LGBT issues====
On March 25, 2010, during the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 debate, the U.S. Senate defeated an attempt by Bennett to &quot;suspend the issuance of marriage licenses to any couple of the same sex until the people of the District of Columbia have the opportunity to hold a referendum or initiative on the question&quot;.

====Civil Liberties====
Bennett supported Bush Administration wiretapping proposals. He was one of only three Republican senators to vote against a proposed constitutional ban on flag burning.

====Economy====
Bennett was a supporter of a flat tax and also was a leading voice for the repeal of the inheritance tax, Alternative Minimum Tax and &quot;marriage penalty&quot;. He stated that it was unfair for the tax burden to fall on the wealthiest one percent of the population. Bennett voted against minimum wage increases and bills that would increase the ease in which workers could organize.

A free trade advocate, Bennett voted in favor of CAFTA, presidential fast-tracking for normalizing trade relations, and removing common goods from national security export controls. He favored recent trade deals with countries such as Chile, Singapore, and Oman.

====Health care====
Bennett was an opponent of public health care and blamed government policies for the high cost of insurance. He voted against proposals to expand government health care, such as those that would let Medicare negotiate in bulk with drug companies or those that would enroll more children in federally provided insurance. He also voted against the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program. During his final Senate campaign, he stated that high taxes were causing insurers to pass the costs off to customers. He believed that new drugs were not being properly developed because pharmaceutical companies feared lawsuits if unexpected side effects occurred.

Bennett was the lead Republican sponsor of the Healthy Americans Act, championed by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden.

====Immigration====
Bennett had a mixed record on immigration control. He voted in favor of the fence along the Mexico–United States border, making English the nation&#x27;s official language and denying citizenship to guest workers. He voted for the 2006 Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, which would have granted legalization of status to an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.

====National security====
Bennett was a supporter of the PATRIOT Act. He voted no on limiting the tours of duty for soldiers in Iraq and on granting habeas corpus rights to detainees in Guantanamo Bay.

====Energy====
Bennett earned a lifetime score of 6% from the League of Conservation Voters. He was against Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, defining goals for a 40 percent reduction in oil use by 2025 and factoring global warming into government planning. Bennett supported Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling and using nuclear power as an energy solution. He also voted against providing emergency energy funding to Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.

==Personal life==

Bennett died on May 4, 2016, aged 82, at his home in Arlington, Virginia, after suffering from pancreatic cancer and a stroke.

Bennett spent the last days of his life apologizing to the Muslim community for controversial rhetoric from Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual nominee and overall victor, Donald Trump.

<text>Dr. Hermann Louis Brill (9 February 1895 – 22 June 1959) was a German resistance fighter, doctor of law and politician (SPD).

== Biography ==

Brill was born in the small town of Gräfenroda, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, on 9 February 1895 as the son of a tailor; after finishing school, he attended the &quot;Herzog-Ernst-Seminar&quot; in Gotha to become a teacher. His political career began in 1918, when he entered the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany; less than two years later, he became a member of the Thuringian parliament (Landtag) for the first time, where he stayed until 1933.

However, Brill only stayed a member of the USPD for four years; in 1922, he left the party again and found his new political home in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) instead. In 1932, Brill was also a member of the federal German parliament (Reichstag).

The Nazis met with resistance from Brill since he first came in contact with them after they became part of the reigning coalition in Thuringia in 1930; Brill was especially opposed to the politics of Nazi minister of the interior Wilhelm Frick, and led a committee of investigation established by the Landtag in 1932 that scrutinised Frick&#x27;s practices. It was also during this time that he met Adolf Hitler, who appeared as a witness in front of the committee, an experience that led to Brill making the decision to resist Hitler &quot;at any time, anywhere and under every circumstance&quot; (&quot;jederzeit, überall, unter allen Umständen&quot;).

Following Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Brill left the SPD in May 1933, scandalised by the party executive&#x27;s passive attitude towards Hitler; one year later, he founded the &quot;Deutsche Volksfront&quot;, a resistance group, in Berlin together with Otto Brass. Brill also wrote a number of essays and leaflets during this time; he was arrested several times by the Gestapo, and after the workings of the &quot;Deutsche Volksfront&quot; were discovered, was convicted of high treason in 1938 and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

After first being jailed in the Zuchthaus Brandenburg-Görden, he was taken to the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1943; following the liberation of Buchenwald on 11 April 1945, he wrote the Buchenwald Manifesto (&quot;Buchenwalder Manifest der demokratischen Sozialisten&quot;).

The same month, Brill also began creating a plan for the administrative rebuilding of Thuringia for the American administration. In June 1945 he was appointed &quot;Regierungspräsident&quot; (president of the government) of Thuringia, an office he lost in July after Thuringia became part of the Soviet occupation zone, due to pressure from Walter Ulbricht. In May 1945 he founded the &quot;Bund Demokratischer Sozialisten&quot; (Federation of Democratic Socialists) in Thuringia, which finally evolved into Thuringia&#x27;s SPD branch, with Brill as its first chairman, but after being arrested and interrogated twice by the Soviet administration, he left Thuringia at the end of 1945 and began working for the American administration in Berlin.

In 1948 Brill helped draft a constitution (Grundgesetz) for the new German republic, and from 1949 to 1953, he was a member of the first Bundestag, the parliament of the newly founded Germany, where he represented Frankfurt am Main I. In his last year as a member of parliament, he put through the first &quot;Bundesentschädigungsgesetz&quot; (compensation law) for those who had been subjected to prosecution based on political views, race or religion.

In later years, Brill taught at the universities of Frankfurt and Speyer. He was responsible for the introduction of political science as a field of study in Germany and wrote several articles pertaining to issues such as German reunification.

Hermann Brill died on 22 June 1959 in Wiesbaden.

<text>Bernhard Vogel (; born 19 December 1932) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He was the 4th Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate from 1976 to 1988 and the 2nd Minister President of Thuringia from 1992 to 2003. He is the only person to have been head of two different German federal states and is the longest-governing Minister President of Germany. He served as the 28th and 40th President of the Bundesrat in 1976/77 and 1987/88.

== Early life and education ==
Vogel was born in Göttingen. He received his &quot;Abitur&quot; in Munich in 1953, and began studies in political science, history, sociology, and economics, first in Heidelberg and then in Munich. He received his doctorate in 1960, while working as a research assistant at the Institute of Political Science at the University of Heidelberg. He became a lecturer there the following year, also working in adult education.

==Political career==
In 1963, Vogel was elected to the municipal council of Heidelberg, but resigned two years later, following his election to the Bundestag. He joined the governing board of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in the Rhineland Palatinate in 1965. From 1965 to 1967, Vogel was a member of the German Bundestag, a position from which he resigned to assume the job of State Minister of Culture and Education in Rhineland-Palatinate under Minister President Peter Altmeier. He continued in the same cabinet position under Altmeier&#x27;s successor in 1969, Helmut Kohl. In 1973, when Kohl became chair of the national CDU, Vogel succeeded him as state party chair in Rhineland-Palatinate.

In December 1976, Vogel became Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate to replace Kohl, who had been elected a federal deputy. Vogel immediately assumed the presidency of the Federal Council until 31 October 1977, at the same time becoming chairman of the supervisory board of the Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), Germany&#x27;s second largest public broadcaster. In the regional elections of March 1979 he maintained a bare majority of his party, with 50% of the vote and 51 regional deputies out of 100. In March 1983 the party improved its position, obtaining 52% of the vote and 57 deputies. Vogel became vice-president of the European Democratic Union (EDU) in 1985 and again won the regional elections on 17 May 1987 but with only a plurality of 45.1% of the vote and 48 deputies elected out of 100, ending the sixteen-year absolute majority of Christian Democrats. Vogel&#x27;s failure to be re-elected as state chair of his party in 1988 led to his resignation as Minister President in a famous speech which he ended with the often-quoted phrase: &quot;May God protect Rhineland-Palatinate!&quot;, an unusual display of public piety by German standards.

After his resignation, Vogel concentrated on the management of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, of which he became chairman in 1989. After the resignation of the first Thuringian Prime Minister Josef Duchač 1992, Vogel became Minister-President of Thuringia on 5 February. From 1993 to 1999, he was chairman of the Thuringian CDU. He gave up the chairmanship of the Adenauer Foundation in 1995. 1994 CDU and SPD formed a grand coalition. In the 1999 elections, the CDU achieved an absolute majority. For reasons of age, Vogel resigned from office as Minister-President on 5 June 2003. His was followed by Dieter Althaus.

== Life after politics ==
From 2001 until 2009, Vogel served again as president of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Berlin.

In 2012, Vogel was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the Universität Essen-Duisburg&#x27;s NRW School of Governance. He gave both seminars and lectures at the university.

Vogel was nominated by his party as delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2022.

<text>Allan Michael Rock (born August 30, 1947) is a Canadian lawyer, former politician, diplomat and university administrator. He was Canada&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations (2003-2006) and had previously served in the Cabinet of Jean Chrétien, most notably as Justice Minister (1993–1997), Health Minister (1997–2002) and Minister of Industry and Infrastructure (2002-03). 

Rock was appointed as President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ottawa by its Board of Governors on June 3, 2008. His term began on July 15, 2008, and it ended on July 1, 2016. Rock was subsequently designated president emeritus. His presidency was marked by steady growth in uOttawa&#x27;s reputation as a research-intensive university with a strong Canadian and international profile. There were minor controversies over freedom of speech during his term. .

Rock joined the University of Ottawa Faculty of Law in 2018, where he is served as a full professor specializing in subjects related to international law (notably international humanitarian law). He also taught Public and Constitutional Law. He retired from teaching in 2023.

Rock is a member of the World Refugee and Migration Council and is chair of the Board of Directors of Security Council Report.

==Early life==
Allan Rock was born to James Thomas Rock and Anne (née Torley) Rock in Ottawa, where he was raised and educated through secondary school. He received a B.A. in 1968 and an LL.B. in 1971 at the University of Ottawa, and he began a 20-year career as a trial lawyer where he specialized in civil, commercial, and administrative litigation. He practised with the Toronto firm then called Fasken and Calvin, later the international firm Fasken.

Rock served as president of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa (SFUO) for the 1969-70 year. He had previously served on the executive of the Arts students association and briefly as SFUO External Commissioner.

In June 1969, Rock met John Lennon during the Lennon&#x27;s &quot;bed-in&quot; in Montrea; Lennon accepted Rock&#x27;s invitation to attend a &quot;peace conference” in Ottawa. Following the conference in Ottawa, Rock drove Lennon and wife Yoko Ono around the city in Rock&#x27;s modest Volkswagen. At Lennon&#x27;s request, they went to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s official residence at 24 Sussex Drive; however, Trudeau was not home, so Lennon wrote a note on the spot and left it at the door. Six months later, Lennon returned to Ottawa and finally met Trudeau.

On graduation from law school, Rock joined Fasken &amp; Calvin, a noted Bay Street law firm in Toronto, where he worked in the litigation department with Walter Williston, Ron Rolls, and Bill Graham. He rose to become partner. Rock and Rolls co-taught the civil procedure section of the Bar Admission course (bringing a smile to many young lawyer&#x27;s face). Rock was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1985.

Rock served 10 years as a Bencher (governor) of Ontario&#x27;s Law Society, being elected by members of the profession in the elections of 1983, 1987 and 1991. He was acclaimed by his peers as the 52nd Treasurer of the Law Society of Upper Canada, serving from 1992 until 1993.

==Ministerial career==
In 1993, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Etobicoke Centre and named Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. In that capacity, he introduced significant changes to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, including major changes to the sentencing provisions that included &quot;conditional sentences&quot; and special provisions when sentencing indigenous offenders. His initiatives also included major gun safety legislation. He also amended the &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act&quot;, to prohibit discrimination in the federal workforce based on sexual orientation. He became Minister of Health in 1997, where he facilitated the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and more than doubled annual health research funding on a national scale.

Subsequently, as Minister of Industry and the Minister responsible for Infrastructure Canada, he introduced Canada&#x27;s innovation strategy, was responsible for Canada&#x27;s three granting councils (the CIHR, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)), and introduced legislation to create the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation to promote applied research in the social sciences and the humanities.

Rock initially declared he would run in the Liberal Party of Canada leadership race to replace the retiring Jean Chrétien. However, he was unable to overcome Paul Martin&#x27;s commanding lead. In 2003, Rock dropped out of the leadership race and announced his support for Martin. When Prime Minister Paul Martin was departing as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Rock was mentioned as a potential candidate to replace him, but on February 3, 2006, Rock announced that he would not run for leadership of the Liberal Party. He later endorsed Stéphane Dion&#x27;s successful bid to lead the party.

==Ambassador to United Nations==
On December 12, 2003, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of Paul Martin, appointed Rock as Canada&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations. Rock thereupon resigned his seat in the House of Commons. As Canada&#x27;s ambassador to the UN, Rock spoke to the UN General Assembly on April 13, 2004, encouraging participation of the member nations of the United Nations on the matter of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.

As the voice of Canadians at the United Nations, Rock was an outspoken advocate of human rights, human security, and reforming the UN. At the 2005 World Summit at the UN, Rock led the successful Canadian effort to secure the adoption by world leaders of the doctrine &quot;Responsibility to Protect&quot; that maintains that the United Nations is mandated to protect populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity when national governments fail to extend such protection or are themselves engaged in such crimes against their own people. Other roles at the UN included chairing a working group on obstacles to long-term development in Haiti, efforts to end the conflict in Northern Uganda and peace negotiations in Abuja, Nigeria involving the Government of Sudan and representatives of the three main rebel groups seeking greater autonomy for Darfur.

Rock tendered his resignation in February 2006, and on February 16, the newly elected Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the appointment of Rock&#x27;s replacement, John McNee. Rock remained in office until June 30, 2006 at Harper&#x27;s request. Upon his departure, he called for an overhaul of the UN.
Rock was later appointed as a UN Special Envoy to investigate allegations that child soldiers were being forced to fight in the Sri Lankan civil war. Rock submitted his report about child soldiers in Sri Lanka on January 15, 2007 to the Security Council of the UN.

==After public life==
Rock announced earlier in June 2006 that he would be moving to Windsor, Ontario, to resume his legal career with Harvey Thomas Strosberg at Sutts, Strosberg LLP. Rock continued to publish op-eds around international issues, including the conduct of UN peacekeepers, the Syrian refugee crisis, and the G20.

==University of Ottawa President==
It was announced in May 2008 that Rock would be appointed as the next president of the University of Ottawa. Rock was an alumnus of the university and had graduated in 1970 with a law degree.

In 1969, during his time as a student at the University of Ottawa, Rock was President of the SFUO (the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa), then the undergraduate student union for the University of Ottawa Following the announcement of Rock&#x27;s appointment as President of the University of Ottawa, &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot; wrote:
At a time when the university, like other Canadian campuses, is experiencing a resurgence in student activism, Mr. Rock would bring a sensitivity to student issues, said Mr. Mitchell. &quot;This is something that Allan Rock is particularly qualified for, being a former student leader himself.&quot;
In two separate incidents during Rock&#x27;s tenure, members of the University of Ottawa hockey team were accused of sexual misconduct. Rock called the scandals &quot;repugnant&quot;, suspended the entire team, and set up a Task Force on Respect and Equality. Ten months later, the task force released a report making 11 recommendations, which Rock promised to implement, saying &quot;that his school will become a &#x27;beacon&#x27; dedicated to eradicating issues of sexual violence.&quot;

His term ended on July 1, 2016, and Rock was succeeded by Jacques Frémont.

===Controversies===

====Censorship====
On February 26, 2009, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association wrote to Rock to express its concern over his administration&#x27;s banning of a student poster and to ask that he redress the situation with a public declaration.

====Ann Coulter====
Amid much media attention, right-wing commentator and author Ann Coulter was scheduled to give a talk at the University of Ottawa on March 23, 2010. The talk was cancelled following student protests at the talk venue. The organizers of the event blamed the university and the protesters. Rock in turn responded in a university press release suggesting that the organizers may have needlessly cancelled the talk. At the centre of the controversy was a letter sent to Coulter before her scheduled talk in Ottawa, signed by the Vice President (Academic), which warned that Coulter could be arrested for hate speech. The letter was condemned as a violation of academic freedom by the Canadian Association of University Teachers and was widely criticized in the media. Three weeks after the cancelled event, Rock publicly stated having pre-approved the letter as the institution&#x27;s official response.

During his time in government, Rock was accused of ethical improprieties after accepting free hospitality from the Irving family, although at the time he was Minister of Health which had no dealings with that family. The allegations were made in a highly partisan environment and no wrongdoing was ever established.

== Honours ==
In 2017, Rock was made a member of Order of Ontario.

in 2020, Rock was made a member of the Order of Canada Order of Canada

After World War II he engaged in rebuilding structures of self-rule in the Soviet occupation zone and was a co-founder and member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD).

==Early years==
Hübener was born in Tacken (now part of Groß Pankow (Prignitz)), Province of Brandenburg. His father was a Protestant pastor. After attending the school at Pforta, Hübener studied history and political science at Christian Albert&#x27;s University, Kiel, and Frederick William&#x27;s University, Berlin. He graduated with a doctorate. Hübener and Otti Bornemann married in 1909. He served as an officer in World War I.

==First term of political career==
After the war, he joined the liberal DDP. In 1919 Otto Fischbeck (DDP), Prussian minister of trade gained him as a collaborator in the Prussian ministry of trade. In 1922 Hübener was elected vice land captain of the Prussian Province of Saxony with Rudolf Oeser (*1858–1926*) serving as Saxon land captain.

In 1924 the Saxon Provinziallandtag (provincial parliament) elected him Landeshauptmann (land-captain), the elected highest-ranking representative of provincial self-rule. He distinguished himself as an expert in economics and administration, searching for consensus among the representatives of the different parties.

Already in the 1920s, he developed ideas for a reorganisation of the heterogenous German states. So he proposed the creation of an independent state called Saxony-Anhalt, combining Prussian Saxony and the independent Free State of Anhalt. In 1930 the members of the provincial parliament reelected him, land captain, for another six years with the votes of the SPD, DDP, and DNVP.

The Nazi regime compulsorily pensioned him after their takeover in 1933. Hübener then dedicated his time and effort to scientific and artistic questions, publishing smaller works in these fields under the pseudonym J.S. Erhard.

==Second term of political career==
After the US Army had invaded the Province of Saxony in April 1945 the &quot;U.S. Group Control Council, Germany&quot; (precursor of the OMGUS) reappointed him land-captain of the Province of Saxony. By early July the US Army retired to allow the Red Army to take Prussian Saxony as part of its Soviet occupation zone, as agreed by the London Protocol in 1944.

On 9 July the Soviet SVAG ordered to merge of what before 1933 had been the land of Anhalt, two Bezirke of the Prussian province of Saxony, Halle-Merseburg, and Magdeburg, and some Brunswickian eastern exclaves and salients into the Land of Saxony. The third Bezirk of Prussian Saxony, the Erfurt governorate, had become a part of Thuringia. Then the SVAG appointed Hübener as the president of the Province of Saxony, a newly created function based in Halle upon Saale.

In the summer of 1945, Hübener became one of the co-founders of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD) in Halle upon Saale. He also received a chair at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. Although he had signed, as Soviet-appointed official, the Soviet-inspired expropriation ordinance on 3 September 1945, pretendingly aim at Nazi war criminals and other circles (largely real estate holders, often of noble descent) uniformly identified as apt for expropriation, he criticized the abuse of the expropriation ordinance as a free ticket to completely destroy property structures and certainty of law.

On the occasion of the first only election in the Soviet zone, allowing parties to compete for seats in provincial and state parliaments, on 20 October 1946, the &quot;Province of Saxony&quot; has renamed the &quot;Province of Saxony-Anhalt&quot;, reflecting the prior merger. On 3 December 1946, the members of the provincial parliament elected Hübener the first minister-president of Saxony-Anhalt with the votes of CDU and LDPD. This made him the only governor in the Soviet zone, who was not a member of the Communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). As such, he was an inconvenience to the Soviet occupation authorities.

By threatening the SVAG to resign from office, Hübener enforced the participation of the Soviet zonal governors in the Conference of Governors in Munich on 5 June 1947, which last time convened the elected governors of all states from all four zones of occupation in Germany. Hoping to avoid the eventual establishment of separate German republics – which was underways with the Bizone – he was, however, disappointed by his Western colleagues (among them his long-time fellow party member Reinhold Maier, then minister-president of Württemberg-Baden). Most of them were already assured that the constitution of a democratic and autonomous German republic can impossibly include the Soviet zone with their puppet states, whereas the zonal central administrations (Zentralverwaltungen) established in July 1945, staffed with communists and directed by the SVAG, were taking the decisions.

While Easterners hoped with a quadripartite Allied agreement there would be the chance that the Soviet Union will release its prey, many Westerners had already come to another conclusion. However, for Westerners, the perpetuated stay of their respective occupying power had by no means the same meaning in everyday life as the Soviet occupation in their zone.

Hübener then saw himself fighting a losing battle. In May 1949, speaking on the third term of Deutscher Volkskongress, a quasi-parliament deciding the first constitution of the to-be-founded separate East German republic, Hübener appealed as the main speaker of LDPD to the delegates: &quot;Our future government shall, will, and must learn, to stand with a free people on the free ground.&quot; While West Germany had been founded on 23 May 1949 the foundation of East Germany was planned for 7 October. On 1 October Hübener resigned from office. He was succeeded by Werner Bruschke (SED).

==Late years==
While many of his political friends fled oppression and persecution in the Soviet zone and later East Germany and East Berlin, Hübener stayed. He retired totally from politics and committed himself again to studies in art and history. He wrote his autobiography, later published in West Germany. He died during a stay at the health spa of Bad Salzuflen in West Germany on 3 June 1958. His remains were translated to East German Wernigerode, where he had spent his retirement.

==Legacy==
The Free Democratic Party, section Sachsen-Anhalt, established in his honour the Erhard-Hübener-Stiftung, a foundation in Halle upon Saale. In Magdeburg a square was named after him.

<text>Werner Bruschke (18 August 1898, in Magdeburg, Province of Saxony – 17 February 1995, in Halle (Saale)) was an East German politician and member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. He was Minister-President of Saxony-Anhalt (GDR) from 13 August 1949 until the state was abolished on 23 July 1952.

From 1933 he worked as tobacco goods dealer and later an insurance agent. After Hitler came to power, Bruschke, together with Ludwig Wellhausen and Ernst Lehmann, established an underground contact network for social democrats in and around Magdeburg. Due to his illegal political activity, he was accused in 1939 of treason (&quot;Landesverrat&quot; and &quot;Hochverrat&quot;) and from 1942 to 1945 was a political prisoner in the concentration camps Sachsenhausen and Dachau.

From 11 May 1992 to his death in 1995, he was the oldest former Minister-President of a German state, preceded in this by Bruno Diekmann.

<text>Reinhard Höppner (2 December 1948 – 9 June 2014) was a German politician (SPD) and writer.

Höppner held a Dr. rer. nat. in mathematics.

In 1990, in the first (and last) free election in the assembly&#x27;s history, he was elected a member of the East German People&#x27;s Chamber (&quot;Volkskammer&quot;), becoming the assembly&#x27;s vice president.

He became the 4th Minister President of Saxony-Anhalt in July 1994 when, his SPD (party) having failed to secure an outright majority, entered into a minority governing coalition with the Green party. This was controversial at the time because most had expected that the SPD, if denied an overall majority, would govern in coalition with the PDS, successor to the old East German ruling party: together the SPD and PDS would have had an overall majority. The so-called Magdeburg model for a minority SPD/Green coalition that excluded the PDS but nevertheless was tolerated (not voted down) by them was subsequently followed in other regional assemblies. Höppner remained in office until 16 May 2002, when he was succeeded by Wolfgang Böhmer.

<text>Newport City Council () is the governing body for Newport, one of the principal areas of Wales. It consists of 51 councillors, who represent the city&#x27;s 20 wards.

The council is currently, and has historically been, held by the Labour Party. However from 2008 to 2012 the council was controlled jointly by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats due to there being no party with an overall majority.

Between 1996 and 2002 the authority was known as Newport County Borough Council.

==History==
Newport is an ancient mesne borough, occupying an important position on the Welsh Marches. The town grew up round the castle built early in the 12th century. Giraldus Cambrensis, writing in 1187, calls it &quot;Novus Burgus&quot;, probably to distinguish it from Caerleon, whose prosperity declined as that of Newport increased. The first lord was Robert Fitzhamon, who died in 1107, and from him the lordship passed to the Earls of Gloucester and Stafford and the Dukes of Buckingham. Hugh le Despenser, who held the lordship for a short time, obtained in 1323 a charter of liberties for the burgesses, granting them freedom from toll throughout England, Ireland and Aquitaine. Hugh, Earl of Stafford granted a further charter in 1385, confirmed by his grandson in 1427, which gave the burgesses the right of self-government and of a merchant gild. On the attainder of the Duke of Buckingham in 1483 the lordship lapsed to the crown, of whom it was held in the 16th and 17th centuries by the Pembrokes, and in the 19th by the Beauforts.

The town was incorporated by Royal Charter of James I in 1623 and confirmed by Charles II in 1685. This created a corporation which consisted of a mayor and twelve aldermen who governed the borough and were responsible for law and order. They were assisted by a recorder and two bailiffs. This system of government lasted in essence until the town was reformed as a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. This reconstituted the corporation as an elected borough council, comprising a mayor, aldermen and councillors. The Newport Borough Police was also formed in 1836.

In 1934 the borough was enlarged by taking in parts of the surrounding parishes of St Woolos, Christchurch, Malpas and Bettws.

When elected county councils were established in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, Newport was included in the administrative county of Monmouthshire, being governed by Monmouthshire County Council, which chose to base itself in Newport. Just over two years later, on 7 November 1891, Newport was one of the first places to become a county borough (other than those which had been created directly by the 1888 act), making it administratively independent from Monmouthshire County Council. The new Newport Civic Centre, designed by architect Thomas Cecil Howitt, was completed in 1964.

Further local government reorganisation in 1974 saw the abolition of county boroughs. Newport became a lower-tier district with borough status. The reformed borough covered a larger area than the former county borough, covering the whole of two former districts and most of a third, which were abolished at the same time:
*Caerleon Urban District
*Magor and St Mellons Rural District, except Henllys (which went to Torfaen) and St Mellons (which went to Cardiff)
*Newport County Borough
The enlarged borough had an area of , and was governed by both Newport Borough Council and Gwent County Council. In 1996, another wave of local-government reorganisation reverted the council to its previous status of a self-governing county borough, taking over the functions of the abolished Gwent County Council in the area. In 2002 Newport was granted formal city status as part of a contest for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 2002, in which one Welsh town was eligible to be awarded city status.

==Political control==
The first election to the council following the Local Government Act 1972 was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the reforms under that act took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been held by the following parties:

Lower-tier borough
County borough
===Leadership===

The leaders of the council since 2004 have been:

==Elections==
Elections take place every five years. The last election was 5 May 2022.

In March 2017 a new political party, the Newport Independents Party, was formed to field candidates in the May 2017 election. It won four seats.

==Wards==
The city is divided into 21 wards, since May 2022 electing 51 councillors. Most of these wards are coterminous with communities (parishes) of the same name. Each community can have an elected council. The following table lists city council wards, communities and associated geographical areas.

==In the news==
In October 2013, the controversial demolition of a 35-metre long Chartist Mural reached national attention. The 35-year-old mural commemorated Newport&#x27;s Chartist history, specifically the Newport Rising of 1839. &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested it was &quot;not just budgets, but a collective cultural history that&#x27;s under attack.&quot;. A spokesman for the council stated that the mural &quot;has served to remind us of Newport’s past, but we must now focus on Newport’s future.&quot; Actor Michael Sheen helped to found a trust, to commission a new memorial, with £50,000 of funding provided by Newport City Council. A smaller replica of the mural, in four panels, was unveiled on 4 November 2019, exactly 180 years since the Chartist uprising. It was created by Oliver Budd, son of the original mural&#x27;s creator, Kenneth Budd. The panels are located on Cefn Road, Rogerstone, and include an information board telling the history of Chartism. 

It was announced in July 2019 that Council Chief Executive Will Godfrey would be resigning in early October after six years to take over at Bath and North East Somerset Council. The Council have stated that as of September 2019, more time is needed to find a replacement, and that an interim CEO will be in place for six to twelve months.

The Council instructed the operators of new &quot;pod&quot; accommodation for homeless people in the city to take down the facilities August 2019 until they were subject to safety inspections and certification.

In September 2019 the council were criticised for delays in arranging school transport for those attending the independent Priory College South Wales at Coleg Gwent in Pontypool.

The Council were reported in September 2019 as being involved in a new trial with Sustrans Cymru, aimed at improving safety outside city primary schools through use of temporary barriers, road and pavement painting, and temporary school crossings.

In September 2019 the Council&#x27;s then leader Debbie Wilcox was announced as a Labour life peer as part of Theresa May&#x27;s 2019 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours. She confirmed later that month that she would be stepping down as Leader of the Council, with a successor to be named.

The Council announced in September 2019 that the city&#x27;s Market Arcade would be closed due to anti-social behaviour, after the Council secured a Public Spaces Protection order to take effect daily from 8pm until 7am. The move came after complaints about city centre drug abuse, property damage, and noise.

The Council has received £4m in Welsh Government funds to pursue a footbridge replacement over Newport railway station, connecting Devon Place and Queensway. It is projected for completion in 2020.

<doc id="338738" wikidata="Q1090423" url="?curid=338738" title="Detoxification">
<text>Detoxification or detoxication (detox for short) is the physiological or medicinal removal of toxic substances from a living organism, including the human body, which is mainly carried out by the liver. Additionally, it can refer to the period of drug withdrawal during which an organism returns to homeostasis after long-term use of an addictive substance. In medicine, detoxification can be achieved by decontamination of poison ingestion and the use of antidotes as well as techniques such as dialysis and (in a limited number of cases) chelation therapy.

Many alternative medicine practitioners promote various types of detoxification such as detoxification diets. Sense about Science, a UK-based charitable trust, determined that most such dietary &quot;detox&quot; claims lack any supporting evidence.

The liver and kidney are naturally capable of detox, as are intracellular (specifically, inner membrane of mitochondria or in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells) proteins such as CYP enzymes. In cases of kidney failure, the action of the kidneys is mimicked by dialysis; kidney and liver transplants are also used for kidney and liver failure, respectively.

==Types==

===Metal detoxification===


===Alcohol detoxification===

Alcohol detoxification is a process by which a heavy drinker&#x27;s system is brought back to normal after being habituated to having alcohol in the body continuously for an extended period of substance abuse. Serious alcohol addiction results in a downregulation of GABA neurotransmitter receptors. Precipitous withdrawal from long-term alcohol addiction without medical management can cause severe health problems and can be fatal. Alcohol detox is not a treatment for alcoholism. After detoxification, other treatments must be undertaken to deal with the underlying addiction that caused alcohol use.

===Drug detoxification===

Clinicians use drug detoxification to reduce or relieve withdrawal symptoms while helping an addicted person adjust to living without drug use. Drug detoxification does not aim to treat addiction but rather represents an early step within long-term treatment. Detoxification may be achieved drug-free or may use medications as an aspect of treatment. Often drug detoxification and treatment will occur in a community program that lasts several months and takes place in a residential setting rather than in a medical center.

Drug detoxification varies depending on the location of treatment, but most detox centers provide treatment to avoid the symptoms of physical withdrawal from alcohol and from other drugs. Most also incorporate counseling and therapy during detox to help with the consequences of withdrawal.

===Metabolic detoxification===
An animal&#x27;s metabolism can produce harmful substances which it can then make less toxic through reduction, oxidation (collectively known as redox reactions), conjugation and excretion of molecules from cells or tissues. This is called xenobiotic metabolism. Enzymes that are important in detoxification metabolism include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione &quot;S&quot;-transferases. These processes are particularly well-studied as part of drug metabolism, as they influence the pharmacokinetics of a drug in the body.

== Alternative medicine ==

Certain approaches in alternative medicine claim to remove alleged &quot;toxins&quot; from the body through herbal, electrical, electromagnetic or other treatments. These toxins may not be linked to symptoms and treatments have no scientific evidence, making the validity of such techniques questionable. There is little evidence for toxic accumulation in these cases, as the liver and kidneys automatically detoxify and excrete many toxic materials including metabolic wastes. Under this theory, if toxins are too rapidly released without being safely eliminated (such as when metabolizing fat that stores toxins), they can damage the body and cause malaise. Such alternative therapies include contrast showers, detoxification foot pads, oil pulling, Gerson therapy, snake-stones, body cleansing, Scientology&#x27;s and Narconon&#x27;s Purification Rundown, water fasting, and metabolic therapy.

<text>Jauhar, sometimes spelled Jowhar or Juhar, was a Hindu Rajput practice of mass self-immolation by women and girls in the Indian subcontinent to avoid capture, enslavement, and rape when facing certain defeat during a war. Some reports of &quot;jauhar&quot; mention women committing self-immolation along with their children. This practice was historically observed in the northwest regions of India, with most famous jauhars in recorded history occurring during wars between Hindu Rajput kingdoms in Rajasthan and the opposing Muslim armies. Jauhar was only performed during war, usually when there was no chance of victory. 
The term &quot;jauhar&quot; often connotes &quot;jauhar&quot;-immolation. Jauhar involved Hindu Rajput women committing suicide with their children and valuables in a massive fire, in order to avoid capture and abuse in the face of inescapable military defeat. At the same time or shortly thereafter, the men would ritualistically march to the battlefield expecting certain death, which in the regional tradition is called &quot;saka&quot;. This practice was intended to show that those committing it valued their honor more highly than their lives.

&quot;Jauhar&quot; by Hindu kingdoms has been documented by Muslim historians of the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire. Among the most often cited examples of &quot;jauhar&quot; is the mass suicide committed in 1303 CE by the women of Chittorgarh fort in Rajasthan, when faced with the invading army of the Khalji dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. The &quot;jauhar&quot; phenomenon was also observed in other parts of India, such as in the Kampili kingdom of northern Karnataka when it fell in 1327 to Delhi Sultanate armies.

There is an annual celebration of heroism called the Jauhar Mela in Chittorgarh where the local people commemorate their ancestors.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;jauhar&quot; is connected to Sanskrit &quot;jatugr̥ha&quot;, meaning a &quot;house plastered with lac and other combustible materials for burning people alive in&quot;. It has also been incorrectly interpreted to have been derived from the Persian &quot;gōhar&quot;, which refers to &quot;gem, worth, virtue&quot;. This confusion, as author John Stratton Hawley states, rose from the fact that &quot;jivhar&quot; and &quot;jauhar&quot; were written in the same manner with the same letter used to denote &quot;v&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. Thus, &quot;jivhar&quot; has also came to be incorrectly associated with the meaning of &quot;jauhar&quot;.

== Practice ==
The practice of &quot;jauhar&quot; has been claimed as being culturally related to &quot;Sati&quot;, with both being a form of suicide by women through self-immolation. However, the two are only superficially similar, with the underlying reason for both being significantly different. Sati was the custom of a widow committing suicide by sitting on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre. Jauhar was collective self-immolation by women in order to escape being captured and forced into slavery by invaders when defeat was imminent. Self-immolation was preferred over simple suicide because it would negate the possibility of any defilement of their dead bodies which their husbands, children and/or clansmen might have to watch.

Kaushik Roy states that &quot;jauhar&quot; was observed only during Hindu-Muslim wars, but not during internecine Hindu-Hindu wars among the Rajputs. John Hawley, however, disagrees with this assertion; he links it to the Greek conquerors who also captured Indian women, arguing that the practice of jauhar might have started with the Greek campaigns in the region. Veena Talwar Oldenburg disagrees as well, saying that &quot;internecine warfare among the Rajput kingdoms almost certainly supplied the first occasions for jauhar, well before the Muslim invasions with which the practice is popularly associated&quot; and that &quot;the geopolitics of the northwest, whence a succession of invaders entered the subcontinent, made of Rajasthan a continual war zone, and its socially most respected community was therefore not the Brahmins but the kshatriya or Rajput castes, who controlled and defended the land. This history predates the coming of the Muslims by more than a millennium. Commemorative stones unearthed and dated in Rajasthan and Vijayanagara mark the deaths of both sexes. Their dates, which can be reliably determined, match perfectly the times and zones of war.&quot;

The phenomenon of &quot;jauhar&quot; has been reported and perceived by Hindus and Muslims differently. In Hindu traditions, &quot;jauhar&quot; was a heroic act by the women of a community facing certain defeat and abuse by the enemy. For Muslim historians, &quot;jauhar&quot; was portrayed as an act forced upon women by their culture. Amir Khusrau the poetic scholar described it, states Arvind Sharma – a professor of Comparative Religion, as &quot;no doubt magical but nevertheless they are heroic&quot;.

== Occurrence ==
Among the most cited cases of &quot;jauhar&quot; are three occurrences at the fort of Chittaur (Chittaurgarh, Chittorgarh), in Rajasthan, in 1303, 1535, and 1568 CE. Jaisalmer was the scene of two occurrences of &quot;jauhar&quot;, one in the year 1299 CE, during the reign of the Alauddin Khalji, and another during the reign of the Tughlaq dynasty in 1326. &quot;Jauhar&quot; and &quot;saka&quot; were considered heroic acts, and the practice was glorified in the local ballads and folklore of Rajasthan.

=== Jauhar during invasion of Alexander of Macedon ===
The mass self-immolation by the Agalassoi tribe of northwest India is mentioned in Book 6 of &quot;The Anabasis of Alexander&quot;, Arrian&#x27;s 2nd-century CE military history of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323 BCE. Arrian mentions Alexander&#x27;s army conquering and enslaving peoples of the northwest Indian subcontinent. During a war that killed many in the Macedonian and Agalossoi armies, some 20,000 men, women and children of an Agalossoi town set fire to the town and immolated themselves when they came to believe that military defeat was imminent.

The Malli tribe also performed a similar act, which Pierre Herman Leonard Eggermont considers &quot;jauhar&quot;. Arrian states that they started burning their houses with themselves in it, though any Indian captured alive in their houses was slaughtered by the Greeks.

=== Jauhar of Sindh: Muhammad bin Qasim ===
In 712, Muhammed bin Qasim and his army attacked various kingdoms of the western regions of the Indian subcontinent. He laid siege to the capital of Raja Dahir, then the Hindu king in the area of Sind. After Dahir had been killed, the queen (Ladi) coordinated the defense of the capital for several months. As the food supplies ran out, she and the women of the capital refused to surrender, lit pyres and committed &quot;jauhar&quot;. The remaining men walked out to their deaths at the hands of the invading army.

=== Jauhar of Gwalior: Iltutmish ===
Shams ud-Din Iltutmish of the Delhi Sultanate attacked Gwalior in 1232, then under control of the Rajputs. The Rajput women committed &quot;jauhar&quot; instead of submitting to Iltutmish&#x27;s army. The place where the women committed mass suicide, in the northern end of the Gwalior fort, is known as Jauhar-tal (or Johar kund, Jauhar Tank).

=== Jauhar of Ranthambore: Alauddin Khalji ===
In 1301, Alauddin Khalji of Delhi Sultanate besieged and conquered the Ranthambore fort. When faced with certain defeat, the defending ruler Hammiradeva decided to fight to death with his soldiers, and his minister Jaja supervised the organization of a &quot;jauhar&quot;. The queens, daughters and other female relatives of Hammira Deva committed jauhar. 

Hammira Dev’s wife Rani Rang Devi and his daughter Padmala, along with other women, made the decision to commit &quot;jauhar&quot; in order to protect their honor from the invading Islamic army. However, they found no time to arrange a huge sacrificial fire and altar in which to commit &quot;jauhar&quot;, thus they committed mass suicide by jumping into the reservoir at the fort. In her honor the reservoir has been named &quot;Padmala Talav&quot;

The &quot;jauhar&quot; at Ranthambore was described by Alauddin&#x27;s courtier Amir Khusrau, which makes it the first &quot;jauhar&quot; to be described in a Persian language text.

=== First Jauhar of Chittor: Alauddin Khalji ===
According to many scholars, the first jauhar of Chittorgarh occurred during the 1303 siege of the Chittor fort. This &quot;jauhar&quot; became a subject of legendary Rajasthani poems, with Rani Padmini the main character, wherein she and other Rajput women commit &quot;jauhar&quot; to avoid being captured by Alauddin Khalji of Delhi Sultanate. The historicity of the first jauhar of Chittor is based on Rajasthani traditional belief as well as Islamic Sufi literature such as Padmavat by Malik Muhammad Jayasi.

===Jauhar of Kampili: Muhammad bin Tughluq===
The Hindu women of the Kampili kingdom of northern Karnataka committed &quot;jauhar&quot; when it fell in 1327 to Delhi Sultanate armies of Muhammad bin Tughluq.

=== Jauhar of Chanderi: Babur ===

The Hindu Rajput king Medini Rai ruled over Chanderi in northern Madhya Pradesh in early 16th century. He tried to help Rana Sanga in the Battle of Khanua against the Muslim armies of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire. In January 1528 CE, his fort was overwhelmed by the invading forces of Babur. The women and children of the Chanderi fort committed &quot;jauhar&quot;, the men dressed up in saffron garments and walked the ritual of &quot;saka&quot; on 29 January.

=== Second Jauhar of Chittor: Bahadur Shah ===
Rana Sanga died in 1528 CE after the Battle of Khanwa. Shortly afterwards, Mewar and Chittor came under the regency of his widow, Rani Karnavati. The kingdom was besieged by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. Rani committed Jauhar with other women on 8 March 1535, while the Rajput army rallied out to meet the besieging Muslim army and committed saka.

As Chittorgarh faced an imminent attack from the Sultan of Gujarat, Karnavati sought the assistance of the Mughal emperor Humayun to whom she had once offered a &quot;rakhi&quot;. Bahadur Shah sacked the fort for the second time. Rani Karnavati with 13,000 women shut themselves with gunpowder, lit it and thus committed mass suicide.

However, the narrative of Karnawati sending Rakhi to Humayun is a fictional story which wrongly became a part of folklore based on an unreliable gossip from the 17th century (200 years after the event). Contemporary Persian and Hindu authorities did not mention this story at all.

=== Third Jauhar of Chittor: Akbar ===
The armies of Mughal Emperor Akbar besieged the Rajput fort of Chittor in September 1567. After his army conquered Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, Hindu women committed &quot;jauhar&quot; in spring of 1568 CE, and the next morning, thousands of Rajput men walked the saka ritual. The Mughal army killed all the Rajputs who walked out the fort. Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, who was not an immediate witness, gave a hearsay account of the event as seen by Akbar and his army. Abu&#x27;l-Fazl states that the women were victims of Rajput men and unwilling participants, and these Rajputs came out walking to die, throwing away their lives. According to David Smith, when Akbar entered the Chittorgarh fort in 1568, it was &quot;nothing but an immense crematorium&quot;.

According to Lindsey Harlan, the &quot;jauhar&quot; of 1568 is a part of regional legend and is locally remembered on the Hindu festival of Holi as a day of Chittorgarh massacre by the Akbar army, with &quot;the red color signifying the blood that flowed on that day&quot;.

=== Three Jauhars of Raisen: Humayun ===
Raisen in Madhya Pradesh was repeatedly attacked by the Mughal Army in the early 16th century. In 1528, the first &quot;jauhar&quot; was led by Rani Chanderi. After the Mughal army left, the kingdom refused to accept orders from Delhi. After a long siege of Raisen fort, that exhausted all supplies within the fort, Rani Durgavati and 700 Raisen women committed the second &quot;jauhar&quot; in 1532 while the men led by Lakshman Tuar committed &quot;saka&quot;. This refusal to submit to Mughal rule repeated, and in 1543 the third &quot;jauhar&quot; was led by Rani Ratnavali.

=== Jauhar of Bundelkhand: Aurangzeb ===
Aurangzeb with vast army laid siege to Bundela in Madhya Pradesh in December 1634 CE. The resident women committed &quot;jauhar&quot; as the fort fell. Those who had not completed the ritual and survived the &quot;jauhar&quot; in progress were forced into the harem. Men were forced to convert to Islam whereas those who refused were executed.

=== Jauhar of Daddanala: Mir Fazlullah ===
In 1710 CE, Mir Fazlullah, a rebel Mughal amir, invaded Daddanala, a town in the Prakasam District of Andhra Pradesh that was the capital of the Dupati Sayapaneni Nayaks. As Sayapaneni Pedda Venkatadri Nayudu, who was in charge, died during the conflict, all the assembled Sayapaneni women set fire to the houses in the fort and were burnt to death. The five-year-old prince Mallikarjuna Nayudu was saved by a maidservant who had smuggled him out through an orifice in the walls of the fort and was raised by his relatives.

===Jauhar among Mughals===

Practices like the jauhar however weren&#x27;t limited to Hindus. Muslim rulers are recorded to have their women killed in order to prevent any degradation of their honour.

Jahangir in his memoirs states that his nobleman Khan-i-Jahan, ordered his wives to commit &quot;jauhar&quot; during a battle with his enemy, Sher Shah Suri. During a war with the Ahom kingdom, Mirza Nathan ordered all Mughal women in his camp to be killed if he died. He later ordered them to perform jauhar.

<text>In mathematics, the Radon–Nikodym theorem is a result in measure theory that expresses the relationship between two measures defined on the same measurable space. A &quot;measure&quot; is a set function that assigns a consistent magnitude to the measurable subsets of a measurable space. Examples of a measure include area and volume, where the subsets are sets of points; or the probability of an event, which is a subset of possible outcomes within a wider probability space.

One way to derive a new measure from one already given is to assign a density to each point of the space, then integrate over the measurable subset of interest. This can be expressed as

:formula_1

where is the new measure being defined for any measurable subset and the function is the density at a given point. The integral is with respect to an existing measure , which may often be the canonical Lebesgue measure on the real line or the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space (corresponding to our standard notions of length, area and volume). For example, if represented mass density and was the Lebesgue measure in three-dimensional space , then would equal the total mass in a spatial region .

The Radon–Nikodym theorem essentially states that, under certain conditions, any measure can be expressed in this way with respect to another measure on the same space. The function is then called the Radon–Nikodym derivative and is denoted by formula_2. An important application is in probability theory, leading to the probability density function of a random variable.

The theorem is named after Johann Radon, who proved the theorem for the special case where the underlying space is in 1913, and for Otto Nikodym who proved the general case in 1930. In 1936 Hans Freudenthal generalized the Radon–Nikodym theorem by proving the Freudenthal spectral theorem, a result in Riesz space theory; this contains the Radon–Nikodym theorem as a special case.

A Banach space is said to have the Radon–Nikodym property if the generalization of the Radon–Nikodym theorem also holds, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, for functions with values in . All Hilbert spaces have the Radon–Nikodym property.

==Formal description==
===Radon–Nikodym theorem===
The Radon–Nikodym theorem involves a measurable space formula_3 on which two σ-finite measures are defined, formula_4 and formula_5 
It states that, if formula_6 (that is, if formula_7 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_4), then there exists a formula_9-measurable function formula_10 such that for any measurable set formula_11
formula_12

===Radon–Nikodym derivative===
The function formula_13 satisfying the above equality is , that is, if formula_14 is another function which satisfies the same property, then formula_15 . The function formula_13 is commonly written formula_17 and is called the . The choice of notation and the name of the function reflects the fact that the function is analogous to a derivative in calculus in the sense that it describes the rate of change of density of one measure with respect to another (the way the Jacobian determinant is used in multivariable integration).

===Extension to signed or complex measures===
A similar theorem can be proven for signed and complex measures: namely, that if formula_4 is a nonnegative σ-finite measure, and formula_7 is a finite-valued signed or complex measure such that formula_20 that is, formula_7 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_22 then there is a formula_4-integrable real- or complex-valued function formula_14 on formula_25 such that for every measurable set formula_26
formula_27

== Examples ==
In the following examples, the set is the real interval [0,1], and formula_9 is the Borel sigma-algebra on .
# formula_4 is the length measure on . formula_7 assigns to each subset of , twice the length of . Then, formula_31.
# formula_4 is the length measure on . formula_7 assigns to each subset of , the number of points from the set {0.1, …, 0.9} that are contained in . Then, formula_7 is not absolutely-continuous with respect to formula_4 since it assigns non-zero measure to zero-length points. Indeed, there is no derivative formula_36: there is no finite function that, when integrated e.g. from formula_37 to formula_38, gives formula_39 for all formula_40.
# formula_41, where formula_7 is the length measure on and formula_43 is the Dirac measure on 0 (it assigns a measure of 1 to any set containing 0 and a measure of 0 to any other set). Then, formula_7 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_4, and formula_46 – the derivative is 0 at formula_47 and 1 at formula_48.

==Properties==
* Let &quot;ν&quot;, &quot;μ&quot;, and &quot;λ&quot; be σ-finite measures on the same measurable space. If &quot;ν&quot; ≪ &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;μ&quot; ≪ &quot;λ&quot; (&quot;ν&quot; and &quot;μ&quot; are both absolutely continuous with respect to &quot;λ&quot;), then formula_49
* If &quot;ν&quot; ≪ &quot;μ&quot; ≪ &quot;λ&quot;, then formula_50
* In particular, if &quot;μ&quot; ≪ &quot;ν&quot; and &quot;ν&quot; ≪ &quot;μ&quot;, then formula_51
* If &quot;μ&quot; ≪ &quot;λ&quot; and is a &quot;μ&quot;-integrable function, then formula_52
* If &quot;ν&quot; is a finite signed or complex measure, then formula_53

==Applications==
===Probability theory===
The theorem is very important in extending the ideas of probability theory from probability masses and probability densities defined over real numbers to probability measures defined over arbitrary sets. It tells if and how it is possible to change from one probability measure to another. Specifically, the probability density function of a random variable is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the induced measure with respect to some base measure (usually the Lebesgue measure for continuous random variables).

For example, it can be used to prove the existence of conditional expectation for probability measures. The latter itself is a key concept in probability theory, as conditional probability is just a special case of it.

===Financial mathematics===
Amongst other fields, financial mathematics uses the theorem extensively, in particular via the Girsanov theorem. Such changes of probability measure are the cornerstone of the rational pricing of derivatives and are used for converting actual probabilities into those of the risk neutral probabilities.

===Information divergences===
If &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;ν&quot; are measures over , and &quot;μ&quot; ≪ &quot;ν&quot;

* The Kullback–Leibler divergence from &quot;ν&quot; to &quot;μ&quot; is defined to be formula_54
* For &quot;α&quot; &gt; 0, &quot;α&quot; ≠ 1 the Rényi divergence of order &quot;α&quot; from &quot;ν&quot; to &quot;μ&quot; is defined to be formula_55

==The assumption of σ-finiteness==
The Radon–Nikodym theorem above makes the assumption that the measure &quot;μ&quot; with respect to which one computes the rate of change of &quot;ν&quot; is σ-finite.

===Negative example===
Here is an example when &quot;μ&quot; is not σ-finite and the Radon–Nikodym theorem fails to hold.

Consider the Borel σ-algebra on the real line. Let the counting measure, , of a Borel set be defined as the number of elements of if is finite, and otherwise. One can check that is indeed a measure. It is not -finite, as not every Borel set is at most a countable union of finite sets. Let be the usual Lebesgue measure on this Borel algebra. Then, is absolutely continuous with respect to , since for a set one has only if is the empty set, and then is also zero.

Assume that the Radon–Nikodym theorem holds, that is, for some measurable function one has
:formula_56

for all Borel sets. Taking to be a singleton set, , and using the above equality, one finds
:formula_57

for all real numbers . This implies that the function , and therefore the Lebesgue measure , is zero, which is a contradiction.

===Positive result===
Assuming formula_58 the Radon–Nikodym theorem also holds if formula_4 is localizable and formula_7 is &quot;accessible with respect to&quot; formula_4, i.e., formula_62 for all formula_63

==Proof==
This section gives a measure-theoretic proof of the theorem. There is also a functional-analytic proof, using Hilbert space methods, that was first given by von Neumann.

For finite measures and , the idea is to consider functions with . The supremum of all such functions, along with the monotone convergence theorem, then furnishes the Radon–Nikodym derivative. The fact that the remaining part of is singular with respect to follows from a technical fact about finite measures. Once the result is established for finite measures, extending to -finite, signed, and complex measures can be done naturally. The details are given below.

===For finite measures===

Constructing an extended-valued candidate First, suppose and are both finite-valued nonnegative measures. Let be the set of those extended-value measurable functions such that:
:formula_64

, since it contains at least the zero function. Now let , and suppose is an arbitrary measurable set, and define:
:formula_65

Then one has
:formula_66

and therefore, .

Now, let be a sequence of functions in such that
:formula_67

By replacing with the maximum of the first functions, one can assume that the sequence is increasing. Let be an extended-valued function defined as
:formula_68

By Lebesgue&#x27;s monotone convergence theorem, one has
:formula_69

for each , and hence, . Also, by the construction of ,
:formula_70

Proving equality Now, since ,
:formula_71

defines a nonnegative measure on . To prove equality, we show that .

Suppose ; then, since is finite, there is an such that . To derive a contradiction from , we look for a positive set for the signed measure (i.e. a measurable set , all of whose measurable subsets have non-negative measure), where also has positive -measure. Conceptually, we&#x27;re looking for a set , where in every part of . A convenient approach is to use the Hahn decomposition for the signed measure .

Note then that for every one has , and hence,

:formula_72

where is the indicator function of . Also, note that as desired; for if , then (since is absolutely continuous in relation to ) , so and
:formula_73
contradicting the fact that .

Then, since also
:formula_74

 and satisfies
:formula_75

This is impossible because it violates the definition of a supremum; therefore, the initial assumption that must be false. Hence, , as desired.

Restricting to finite values Now, since is -integrable, the set is -null. Therefore, if a is defined as
:formula_76

then has the desired properties.

Uniqueness As for the uniqueness, let be measurable functions satisfying
:formula_77

for every measurable set . Then, is -integrable, and
:formula_78

In particular, for or . It follows that
:formula_79

and so, that -almost everywhere; the same is true for , and thus, -almost everywhere, as desired.

===For -finite positive measures===
If and are -finite, then can be written as the union of a sequence of disjoint sets in , each of which has finite measure under both and . For each , by the finite case, there is a -measurable function such that
:formula_80

for each -measurable subset of . The sum formula_81 of those functions is then the required function such that formula_82. 

As for the uniqueness, since each of the is -almost everywhere unique, so is .

===For signed and complex measures===
If is a -finite signed measure, then it can be Hahn–Jordan decomposed as where one of the measures is finite. Applying the previous result to those two measures, one obtains two functions, , satisfying the Radon–Nikodym theorem for and respectively, at least one of which is -integrable (i.e., its integral with respect to is finite). It is clear then that satisfies the required properties, including uniqueness, since both and are unique up to -almost everywhere equality.

If is a complex measure, it can be decomposed as , where both and are finite-valued signed measures. Applying the above argument, one obtains two functions, , satisfying the required properties for and , respectively. Clearly, is the required function.

==The Lebesgue decomposition theorem==
Lebesgue&#x27;s decomposition theorem shows that the assumptions of the Radon–Nikodym theorem can be found even in a situation which is seemingly more general. Consider a σ-finite positive measure formula_4 on the measure space formula_84 and a σ-finite signed measure formula_7 on formula_9, without assuming any absolute continuity. Then there exist unique signed measures formula_87 and formula_88 on formula_9 such that formula_90, formula_91, and formula_92. The Radon–Nikodym theorem can then be applied to the pair formula_93.

<text>The white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) is a species of passerine bird native to North America. A medium-sized member of the New World sparrow family, this species is marked by a grey face and black and white streaking on the upper head. It breeds in brushy areas in the taiga and tundra of the northernmost parts of the continent and in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific coast. While southerly populations in the Rocky Mountains and coast are largely resident, the breeding populations of the northerly part of its range are migratory and can be found as wintering or passage visitors through most of North America south to central Mexico.

==Etymology==

The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name &quot;Zonotrichia&quot; is from Ancient Greek (, ) and (, ). The species name &quot;leucophrys&quot; is from (, ) and (, ).

== Description ==
Adults have black and white stripes on their head, a gray face, brown streaked upper parts and a long tail. The wings are brown with bars and the underparts are gray. Their bill is pink or yellow. They are similar in appearance to the white-throated sparrow, but do not have the white throat markings or yellow lores.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.9–6.3 in (15–16 cm)
* Weight: 0.9–1.0 oz (25–28 g)
* Wingspan: 8.3–9.4 in (21–24 cm)

== Subspecies ==

There are five currently recognized subspecies of white-crowned sparrow (&quot;pugetensis&quot;, &quot;gambelii&quot;, &quot;nuttalli&quot;, &quot;oriantha&quot;, and &quot;leucophrys&quot;), varying in breeding distribution migratory route. Birds of the subspecies &quot;nuttalli&quot; are permanent residents in California, while birds of the subspecies &quot;gambelli&quot; may migrate as far as the Arctic Circle during the summer breeding season. Northern birds migrate to the southern United States and northern Mexico.

== Distribution ==

Their breeding habitat is brushy areas across northern Canada and the western United States.

The white-crowned sparrow is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. It has been sighted in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Norway. In 2008 a white-crowned sparrow was spotted in Cley next the Sea in Norfolk, England. To commemorate the event an image of the bird was included in a window at St Margaret&#x27;s Church.

== Behaviour ==
These birds forage on the ground or in low vegetation, but sometimes make short flights to catch flying insects. They mainly eat seeds, other plant parts and insects. In winter, they often forage in flocks.

White-crowned sparrows nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs and lay three to five brown-marked gray or greenish-blue eggs.

The white-crowned sparrow is known for its unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, which allows it to stay half-awake for up to two weeks during migration. This effect has been studied for possible human alertness applications in shift work and truck driving.

Recent studies by ornithologists including Elizabeth Derryberry have shown that white-crowned sparrow songs are affected by human activity and noise.

<doc id="338757" wikidata="Q319015" url="?curid=338757" title="Yigal Allon">
<text>Yigal Allon (; 10 October 1918 – 29 February 1980) was an Israeli military leader and politician. He was a commander of the Palmach and a general in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). He was also a leader of the Ahdut HaAvoda and Israeli Labor parties. He served briefly as acting Prime Minister of Israel between the death of Levi Eshkol and the appointment of Golda Meir in 1969. Allon was the first native-born Israeli to serve as Prime Minister of Israel (the first elected native-born Prime Minister would later be Yitzhak Rabin in 1974). He was a government minister from the third Knesset to the ninth inclusive.

Born a child of pioneer settlers in the Lower Galilee, Allon initially rose to prominence through his military career. After the outbreak of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, he joined the Haganah and later the Palmach. He commanded a squad and organized key operations in the Jewish Resistance Movement such as the Night of the Bridges. During the 1947–1949 Palestine war, Allon commanded the conquest of the Galilee, Lod and Ramla, as well as the entire Negev up to Eilat as Head of the Southern Command.

Allon entered politics after a forced relief from command by then-Premier David Ben-Gurion. During his political career, he served as foreign and education minister, deputy prime minister, and briefly as acting prime minister. He was one of the architects of the creation of the Labor Party, advocating for the merger of Ahdut HaAvoda with Mapai. 

In 1967, he devised the eponymous Allon Plan, which proposed next steps for Israel after the Six-Day War. While the plan was not officially adopted, it served as a guideline for the next decade of Israeli settlement. He also took part in the Sinai Interim Agreement in 1975.

In 1980, Allon died unexpectedly of cardiac arrest while campaigning for the leadership of the Labor Party.

== Early years (1918–1931) ==
Yigal Peikowitz (later Allon) was born on 10 October 1918 in Kfar Tavor, then a part of the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. His father, Reuven, immigrated to Palestine in 1890 along with his father and elder brother from Belarus, then a part of the Russian Empire. His mother, Haia Shortz-Peikowitz, came from a Jewish family in Safed. Her father was a founding member of Rosh Pinna.

Reuven originally planned to name his son &quot;Yigael,&quot; meaning &quot;he will be redeemed,&quot; but decided the name was too passive and instead chose &quot;Yigal,&quot; which means &quot;he will redeem.&quot;

When Allon was five years old, his mother died, and his older brothers left home. As the youngest child, he remained with his father. Kfar Tavor was an isolated area that experienced frequent raids and thefts by neighboring Arab and Bedouin communities. After his bar mitzvah at age 13, Allon was given a gun by his father to protect the family crops from thieves.

In 1934, at the age of 16, Allon enrolled at the Kadoorie Agricultural High School. He found his education lacking compared to his urban peers, and his teachers encouraged him to improve. In his autobiography, he wrote about the school director’s influence on his social values.

During school, Allon became a Labor Zionist. After graduating in 1937, Allon and a group of Labor Zionists established Kibbutz Ginosar on land leased to the settlement of Migdal by the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association. There, he became known as a local leader and formed a friendship with Berl Katznelson.

== Military career (1931–1950) ==

Allon joined the Haganah in 1931 and later commanded a field unit and a mobile patrol in northern Palestine during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. 

While working in the fields of the kibbutz during the revolt, Allon was summoned by Yitzhak Sadeh to take a command position in the Haganah. After completing a squad command course, he was appointed to lead the Mobile Guards. In this role, he participated in the expulsion of Arabs who brought their flocks onto Jewish fields and became known for planning ambushes against infiltrating gangs.

During this time, Allon also took part in operations with the Special Night Squads (SNS) under the command of Orde Wingate and Bala Bredin. In 1941, he became one of the founding members of the Palmach. From 1941 to 1942, he served as a scout with British forces in Syria and Lebanon. 

In 1945, Allon became Commander in Chief of the Palmach. On June 22, 1948, during David Ben-Gurion&#x27;s confrontation with the Irgun over the distribution of weapons from the &quot;Altalena&quot;, Allon commanded the troops ordered to shell the vessel. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, he led major operations across three fronts, including Operation Yiftach in the Galilee, Operation Dani in the central region, and Operations Yoav and Horev in the Negev.

Allon&#x27;s final major military roles as commander were in October and December 1948: Operation Yoav toward the Hebron Hills and Operation Horev along the southern Egyptian front. As Operational Commander of the Southern Command, Allon was responsible for security along the borders with Egypt and parts of Jordan. On June 4, 1949, he declared an wide closed military zone along the border. 

Allon&#x27;s successes in the war are often credited to his intuition and foresight, though these traits sometimes led to military failures.

On October 18, 1949, during an official visit to Paris, Allon was informed by his French hosts that Ben-Gurion had decided to replace him with Moshe Dayan as Operational Commander. Many of Allon&#x27;s staff officers resigned in protest. Allon retired from active service in 1950.

== Political career (1950–1980) ==

In January 1948, Allon helped form the Mapam party. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, leader of the rival governing Mapai party, told Allon to dissociate himself from Mapam, considering it too left-wing and a potential threat to the State of Israel&#x27;s security. In December 1948, Mapam co-leader Meir Ya&#x27;ari criticized Allon’s use of tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees for strategic purposes.

From 1950 to 1952, Allon studied philosophy and history at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

After concluding his military career, Allon entered public politics. He became a key figure in Ahdut HaAvoda, which had split from Mapam in 1954, and was first elected to the Knesset in 1955, where he served until his death. He was a member of the Economic Affairs Committee, Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, Education and Culture Committee, Joint Committee on the Motion for the Agenda Regarding Sports in Israel, and the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.

Allon served as Israel&#x27;s Labor Minister from 1961 to 1968, where he focused on improving the state employment service, expanding the road network, and promoting labor relations legislation. From 1968 to 1969, he held the positions of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Immigrant Absorption.

Following the death of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol on February 26, 1969, Allon briefly served as interim Prime Minister until March 17, 1969, when Golda Meir was elected leader of the Labor Party and became Prime Minister. In Meir&#x27;s government, Allon served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education and Culture, a role he held until 1974.

During the September 1970 crisis in Jordan, Allon supported aiding King Hussein against the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1974, he participated in negotiations related to the Separation of Forces Agreement, 

In 1974, Allon was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position he held until 1977. At the time of his sudden death in 1980, he was a candidate for the leadership of the Alignment, challenging the incumbent leader, Shimon Peres.

=== Allon Plan (1967) ===
Allon was the architect of the Allon Plan, a proposal for a partial Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank after the Six-Day War, aiming to facilitate a negotiated partition of the territory. The plan was presented to the cabinet in July 1967. Although it was never formally adopted, the Allon Plan influenced Israeli settlement policies in the following decade. 

According to the plan, Israel would retain approximately one-third of the West Bank, focusing on the Jordan Valley, where a strip of settlements and military installations would be established. The heavily populated mountain ridge to the west of the Jordan Valley, populated by Palestinians, was envisioned as part of a confederation with Jordan. Additional areas, including land flanking the Jericho-Jerusalem road, Gush Etzion, and parts of the Hebron Hills, were to be annexed to Israel. Minor territorial adjustments were proposed along the Green Line, particularly near Latrun.

The plan also included proposals for the development of Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, the rehabilitation of the Jewish Quarter in the Old City, and the annexation of the Gaza Strip, accompanied by the relocation of its Palestinian population to other areas.

== Death and legacy ==
Allon died of heart failure in Afula on 29 February 1980. He was buried in the cemetery of Kibbutz Ginosar in the Northern District on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. The funeral was attended by tens of thousands of mourners, with condolences extended by many world leaders, including Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.

=== Legacy ===
Explaining the growing admiration for Yigal Allon three decades after his death, Oren Dagan of the Society for the Preservation of Israel Heritage Sites said, &quot;people wish to live in the kind of state Yigal Allon dreamed of, for example on the Arab-Jewish issue. This isn&#x27;t a post-Zionist approach, neither hesitant nor apologetic. It&#x27;s an approach of safety and security that says, &#x27;Our place is here,&#x27; but still emphasizes the importance of dialogue, and never through condescension or arrogance. Allon extended a hand in peace, and that&#x27;s the approach we want leaders to adopt today.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Allon married Ruth, who immigrated to Palestine from Germany in 1934, a year after the installment of the Machtergreifung. They had three children. Their eldest daughter Nurit () was on the autism spectrum and could not speak until age 5. Nurit was eventually institutionalized in Scotland, where Allon visited her once a year.

After the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, Allon changed his surname from &quot;Peikowitz&quot; to &quot;Allon&quot; (), meaning &quot;oak tree&quot;.

In the 1950s, the Allons helped their neighbors adopt a child, Tziona Heiman, from a hospital in Jerusalem. This event was later linked to the broader Yemenite Children Affair, during which many Jewish babies, primarily from Yemen, were put up for adoption in Israel. Heiman expressed that she was treated with love and care by her adoptive family. In an interview, Allon&#x27;s wife stated they had no knowledge of Heiman&#x27;s origin. As of 2016, Heiman&#x27;s origins remained unclear.

<text>Juan Antonio Ríos Morales (; November 10, 1888 – June 27, 1946) was a Chilean political figure who served as president of Chile from 1942 to 1946, during the height of World War II. He died in office.

==Early life==
Ríos was born at the &quot;Huichicura&quot; hacienda, near the town of Cañete, a coal-mining village in the Arauco Province of southern Chile. He was the youngest son of Anselmo Ríos, a rich landowner, and his third wife Lucinda Morales. His father (aged 69 to his young wife&#x27;s 19 at marriage) died when he was very young so he and his three brothers were raised single-handedly by his mother. He completed his primary studies at the rural school of Cañete, and his secondary studies first at the &quot;Liceo&quot; of Lebu and later at the one in Concepción, and continued legal studies at the courses given at the annex of his school. Ríos became a lawyer in 1914 with an exposition on the creation and development of the police in Chile.

==Political rise==
A member of the conservative wing of the Radical Party since his high school days, he was elected local president of the youth branch of that party and later city councillor. During the presidential election of 1920 he campaigned for Arturo Alessandri, being responsible for the southern part of the country. He was rewarded by Alessandri with the appointment of Consul-general and Chargé d&#x27;affaires to Panama. On October 21, 1921 he married Marta Ide, and they had three sons: Juan, Carlos, and Fernando.

Ríos returned to Chile in 1924, to run in that year&#x27;s congressional elections. He was elected as deputy for &quot;Arauco, Lebu and Cañete,&quot; and was reelected in 1926. After Alessandri&#x27;s return to power following the Chilean coup of 1925, he participated of the committee charged with drafting a new constitution, that led to the approval and proclamation of the 1925 Chilean Constitution.

In the meantime, Juan Antonio Ríos had become president and one of the principal leaders of the Radical Party. During the administration of colonel Carlos Ibáñez del Campo he was caught between his party&#x27;s opposition to the government&#x27;s dictatorial administration and his personal admiration for the government&#x27;s results. As party president, he participated of the &quot;Thermal Congress&quot; (an unelected Congress convened by President Ibañez) as a senator for &quot;Arauco, Malleco, and Cautín&quot;. After the fall of general Ibañez in 1931, Ríos was expelled from his party for his cooperation with the former dictatorship.

The year 1932 was a very turbulent time politically for Ríos. First, he supported the Chilean coup of 1932, a successful coup that toppled President Juan Esteban Montero, and resulted in the proclamation of the Socialist Republic of Chile. Then he went on to become the Minister of the Interior when Carlos Dávila took over as head of state. In turn, after the resignation of Dávila three months later, general Bartolome Blanche became president, and Ríos became his Minister of Justice. Nonetheless, with the election of Arturo Alessandri in the presidential election of 1932 and the return to institutional normality, he was politically shunned.

Ríos ran as an independent in the congressional election of 1933 and was elected as deputy for &quot;Arauco and Cañete.&quot; That was the beginning of his political comeback. In 1935 he was welcomed back into the Radical fold. In 1937, the Radical Party, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Democratic Party, and the Radical Socialist Party, as well as organizations such as the Confederación de Trabajadores de Chile (CTCH) trade union, the Mapuche movement which unified itself in the Frente Único Araucano, and the feminist Movimiento Pro-Emancipación de las Mujeres de Chile (MEMCh) allied themselves in the Popular Front (), with Ríos becoming its first president. Nonetheless, Ríos was defeated in the internal presidential primaries by Pedro Aguirre Cerda, who got the nomination and then went on to win the presidential election of 1938.

During the Aguirre Cerda administration, Ríos was president of Chile&#x27;s largest bank, the state-owned &quot;Caja de Credito Hipotecario&quot;, which made mortgage loans to Chilean farmers. He also sought to increase his political influence inside his party. His main political rival was Gabriel González Videla, but soon he managed to have him named ambassador to France, leaving him free to pursue his own political advancement. At the time it was rumored that President Aguirre Cerda had also offered him an ambassadorial position, but that he had answered: &quot;... tell the President that I thank him for his offer, but I am moving up, not down&quot;.

===1942 presidential campaign===

In 1941, due to his rapidly escalating illness, President Aguirre Cerda appointed his minister of the Interior, Jerónimo Méndez as vice-president and died soon after, on November 25, 1941. A presidential election was called for February 1, 1942. This was the opportunity Ríos had been waiting for and he immediately started to campaign. Nevertheless, two days before the internal primaries, Gabriel González Videla returned to Chile to oppose him for the nomination. The results were too close to call, so a &quot;tribunal of honor&quot; (electoral commission) was constituted, and Juan Antonio Ríos was finally proclaimed the candidate of the left-wings&#x27; coalition. This Democratic Alliance () was formed by the Radical Party, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Democratic Party, and the Workers&#x27; Socialist Party.

The left-wings&#x27; coalition was united against a common opponent, General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Ríos was a member of the conservative wing of the Radical Party and defeated Ibáñez in the 1942 election, portraying himself as a conservative anti-fascist candidate. Ibáñez had the support of Chile&#x27;s Conservative party, Liberal Party, National Socialist party, Popular Socialist Vanguard and the majority of the independents. Ríos obtained 55.95% of the votes and took office on April 2, 1942.

==Presidency==
Ríos&#x27; presidency was marked from the very beginning by parliamentary instability, caused by rivalries between the different political tendencies in his cabinet, and the renewed and increased influence of Congress. The Chilean Communist Party opposed Ríos because he had initially chosen neutrality in World War II and had refused to break off diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers, while the right-wing accused him of complacency with the left. Economically, he faced labor unrest at home, brought about in large part by a drop in copper prices worldwide, while at the same time, the Chilean Socialist Party accused him of being too soft with big business and of failing to enact labour legislation protecting workers&#x27; rights.

===Domestic affairs===

Even though Ríos had been elected with the support of the Communist party, he refused the direct participation of this party in the government, thus earning their opposition. Ríos&#x27; option instead was to appoint &quot;technical experts&quot; and &quot;personal friends&quot; to cabinet and high-level government positions; this policy allowed him to include not only members of his own party, but also from the Conservative and Liberal opposition.

In 1943, Congress approved and Ríos signed the first constitutional reform to the 1925 constitution. This reform gave constitutional rank to the Comptroller General () and limited the power of the President with respect to public expenditures without congressional approval.

In 1944, the Radical Party itself presented to Ríos a serie of propositions which he deemed unacceptable. Those included breaking-off diplomatic relations with Francoist Spain — diplomatic and especially economic pressure had caused him to finally break off relations with the Axis Powers in January 1943 — the recognition of the USSR and a cabinet exclusively composed of Radicals. His refusal to implement the Radical Party&#x27;s propositions, and the violent repression of riots that took place on Plaza Bulnes in Santiago, leading to several deaths, caused the resignation of all the Radical ministers, leaving the President without a party.

These internal divisions partly explain the right-wing parties success&#x27; during the 1945 legislative elections, which were a debacle for the Socialists and the Communists. The Radicals themselves lost a number of seats.

After his return from the United States, and faced with failing health, he transferred his presidential powers to his minister of the Interior Alfredo Duhalde (January 17, 1946) and died of cancer roughly 6 months later, on June 27.

===Economic development===
Ríos&#x27; administration — continuing the Aguirre Cerda policies — focused on the development of the steel, power and oil industries. To that effect, funds were channeled via the &quot;Production Development Corporation&quot; (), created under the previous administration.

Thus on January 17 of 1944, it was created the &quot;National Electricity Company&quot; (); on June 19 of 1950 the National Oil Company (); and in 1942, the Pacific Steel Company (), which opened the &quot;Huachipato&quot; steelworks next to the port of Talcahuano. 

===Foreign relations===
Up to 1943, Chile and Argentina had declined to sever relations with the Axis powers, and the Chilean election was viewed by many as critical during World War II. A bitter disagreement sprung up between the president and its supporting Democratic Alliance. Initially, Ríos&#x27; government was committed to neutrality during the war, but the left-wing parties of his coalition were in favor of an immediate and total rupture with the Axis as well as for the recognition of the USSR, which they saw as their contribution to the world-struggle against fascism. Diplomatic and especially economic pressure from the United States finally caused him to break off relations with the Axis Powers on January 20, 1943; however, he only declared war on Germany and Italy, and while beginning to imprison Japanese nationals did not declare war on Japan until 1945. By doing so, he made Chile eligible for the Lend-Lease program, and obtained the necessary loans to help along the economic recovery, and in 1945, Chile belonged to the victorious nations and had thus gained the right to participate in the postwar international conferences.

===Death===
President Ríos returned from his state visit and reassumed power on December 3, 1945; but by then he was already terminally ill with cancer. He transferred his presidential powers on January 17, 1946, to his Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Duhalde, who took over as vice-president. Juan Antonio Ríos spent his last days at &quot;Villa Paidahue&quot;, in La Reina, where he died on June 27, 1946, before the end of his constitutional period.

<doc id="338770" wikidata="Q313649" url="?curid=338770" title="Seiji Ozawa">
<text>was a Japanese conductor known internationally for his work as music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony, and especially the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), where he served from 1973 for 29 years. After conducting the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert in 2002, he was director of the Vienna State Opera until 2010. In Japan, he founded the Saito Kinen Orchestra in 1984, their festival in 1992, and the Tokyo Opera Nomori in 2005.

Ozawa rose to fame after he won the 1959 Besançon competition. He was invited by Charles Munch, then the music director of the BSO, for the following year to Tanglewood, the orchestra&#x27;s summer home, where he studied with Munch and Pierre Monteux. Winning the festival&#x27;s Koussevitzky Prize earned him a scholarship with Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic and brought him to the attention of Leonard Bernstein, who made him his assistant with the New York Philharmonic in 1961. He became artistic director of the festival and education program in Tanglewood in 1970, together with Gunther Schuller. In 1994, the new main hall there was named after him.

Ozawa conducted world premieres such as György Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Polyphony&quot; in 1975 and Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s opera &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot; in Paris in 1983. He received numerous international awards. Ozawa was the first Japanese conductor recognized internationally and the only one of superstar status.

== Life and career ==
=== Early years ===
Ozawa was born on September 1, 1935, to Japanese parents in the Japanese-occupied Manchurian city of Mukden, now known as Shenyang in China. He began piano lessons at age seven. When his family returned to Japan in 1944, he began studying piano with Noboru Toyomasu, with a focus on the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. 

After graduating from the Seijo Junior High School in 1950, Ozawa broke two fingers in a rugby game. Hideo Saito, his teacher at the Toho Gakuen School of Music, brought him to a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5, ultimately shifting his musical focus from piano performance to conducting. He studied conducting and composition, achieving first prizes in both fields, and worked with the NHK Symphony Orchestra and the Japan Philharmonic while still a student. He graduated in 1957.

=== International success ===
Ozawa travelled to Europe for further studies; he supported himself by selling Japanese motor scooters. He achieved the first prize at the 1959 International Competition of Orchestra Conductors in Besançon, France, which made him known internationally; Charles Munch, then the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, invited him to attend the Berkshire Music Center (now the Tanglewood Music Center) the following year to study with Munch and Pierre Monteux. Shortly after his arrival there, Ozawa won the Koussevitzky Prize for outstanding student conductor, Tanglewood&#x27;s highest honor, which earned him a scholarship to study conducting with Herbert von Karajan.

Ozawa moved to West Berlin. Under the tutelage of Karajan, Ozawa caught the attention of Leonard Bernstein, who then appointed him as assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, where Ozawa served during the 1961–1962 and 1964–1965 seasons. He first conducted at Carnegie Hall in 1961 and first conducted the San Francisco Symphony in 1962. Ozawa remains the only conductor to have studied under both Karajan and Bernstein. In December 1962 Ozawa was involved in a controversy with the NHK Symphony Orchestra when some players, unhappy with his style and personality, refused to play under him. Ozawa went on to conduct the rival Japan Philharmonic Orchestra instead. In July 1963, Ozawa was in New York to appear as a guest conductor, and while there appeared on the American television program &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;.

From 1964 until 1968, Ozawa served as the first music director of the Ravinia Festival, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1969 he served as the festival&#x27;s principal conductor. He conducted the Vienna Philharmonic first in 1966 at the Salzburg Festival.

=== Toronto Symphony Orchestra ===

In his first post as music director, Ozawa led the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) from 1965 to 1969. Basically every work on the programs, such as the symphonies by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Mahler were new for him, and he described the audience as patient and supportive in a later interview. Concerts were held at the Massey Hall; they played for the opening of the new Toronto City Hall in 1965, for the Commonwealth Arts Festival in Glasgow and the Expo 67 in Montreal. 

Ozawa made notable recordings with the TSO, including the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; by Berlioz in 1966, a highly lauded recording by music critics.

In 1967, Ozawa and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra recorded Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot; that Koussevitzky had commissioned and Bernstein first conducted with the BSO. In Ozawa&#x27;s version, the first in North America, Yvonne Loriod was the pianist as in the premiere. The recording was nominated for a Grammy Award. When it was reissued on CD in 2004, a reviewer noted: &quot;The orgiastic fifth and 10th movements still pack quite a punch, and in a very real sense, while many more modern versions have come and gone this one still holds its own with the best of them.&quot; The composer would entrust Ozawa with the premiere of his opera &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot; in Paris in 1983.

In 1969 Ozawa and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra recorded an album of four works of Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, Asterism For Piano And Orchestra, Requiem For String Orchestra, Green For Orchestra (November Steps II), and The Dorian Horizon For 17 Strings.

=== San Francisco Symphony ===
Ozawa was music director of the San Francisco Symphony from 1970 to 1976. In San Francisco, he combined Bernstein&#x27;s charismatic style with the flower power of the west coast, wearing long hair and flowery shirts, and sometimes conducting cross-over programs. In 1972, he led the San Francisco Symphony in its first commercial recordings in a decade, recording music inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In 1973, he took the San Francisco Symphony on a European tour, which included a Paris concert that was broadcast via satellite in stereo to San Francisco station KKHI. 

He was involved in a 1974 dispute with the San Francisco Symphony&#x27;s players&#x27; committee that denied tenure to the timpanist Elayne Jones and the bassoonist Ryohei Nakagawa, two young musicians Ozawa had selected. He was committed to contemporary music then, for example commissioning &quot;San Francisco Polyphony&quot; from György Ligeti in 1975. During the time, he impressed by &quot;the brilliance of his interpretations, with his supreme command of the most intimidatingly complex scores and as a graceful, even glamorous stage performer&quot;.

=== Boston Symphony Orchestra ===

In 1970, Ozawa and Gunther Schuller became artistic directors of the Berkshire Music Festival in Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO). Ozawa became music director of the BSO in 1973. He remained in that position for 29 years, the longest tenure of any music director there, surpassing the 25 years held by Serge Koussevitzky. He conducted more world premieres, including works by Ligeti and Tōru Takemitsu.

Ozawa won his first Emmy Award in 1976, for the BSO&#x27;s PBS television series, &quot;Evening at Symphony&quot;; in 1994, he was awarded his second Emmy for Individual Achievement in Cultural Programming for &quot;Dvořák in Prague: A Celebration&quot;. He played a key role as a teacher and administrator at the Tanglewood Music Center, the Boston Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s summer music home that has programs for young professionals and high school students. In 1994, the BSO dedicated its new Tanglewood concert hall &quot;Seiji Ozawa Hall&quot; in honor of his 20th season with the orchestra. In recognition of his impact on the BSO, Ozawa was named music director laureate.

On October 24, 1974, Ozawa conducted a Japanese combined orchestra which included the Toho Gakuen School of Music Orchestra and members of the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra with solo cello Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi and solo violist Nobuko Imai in a world-wide telecast (carried on the PBS television network in the United States) from the United Nations building in New York City. The concert included a work by Beethoven and Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; with the two Japanese soloists.

In December 1979, Ozawa conducted a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony with the Beijing Symphony Orchestra. This was the first time since 1961 that the symphony was performed live in the People&#x27;s Republic of China due to a ban on Western music.

Ozawa made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1992, conducting Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin (opera)&quot;, in a cast with Mirella Freni as Tatyana. He returned to the house in 2008 with &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;, both productions described as passionate and electrifying.

Ozawa created a controversy in 1996–1997 with sudden demands for change at the Tanglewood Music Center, which made Gilbert Kalish and Leon Fleisher resign in protest. Subsequent criticism by Greg Sandow generated controversy in the press.

Ozawa used an unorthodox conducting wardrobe, wearing the traditional formal dress with a white turtleneck instead of the usual starched shirt, waistcoat, and white tie.

=== Saito Kinen Orchestra ===
In an effort to merge all-Japanese orchestras and performers with international artists, Ozawa, along with Kazuyoshi Akiyama, founded the Saito Kinen Orchestra in 1984, named after his teacher. Since its creation, the orchestra has gained a prominent position in the international music community, establishing a festival in Matsumoto in 1992, later named the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival. A 2013 recording from the festival of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot; earned Ozawa his only Grammy Award in 2016, for best opera recording.

In 1998, Ozawa conducted a simultaneous international performance of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; at the opening ceremony of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Ozawa conducted an orchestra and singers in Nagano, and was joined by choruses singing from Beijing, Berlin, Cape Town, New York City, and Sydney – as well as the crowd in the Nagano Olympic Stadium. This was the first time a simultaneous international audio-visual performance had been achieved.

=== Vienna State Opera ===

On New Year&#x27;s Day 2002, Ozawa conducted the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert, the first Japanese in a long tradition. In 2002, he stepped down from the BSO music directorship to become principal conductor of the Vienna State Opera. 
He had conducted at the house before, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot; and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; in 1988, &quot;Pique Dame&quot; in 1992 and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; in 1993, and began his tenure with productions of Janáček&#x27;s Jenůfa and Krenek&#x27;s &quot;Jonny spielt auf&quot;.

In 2005, he founded and conducted its production of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot;. On February 1, 2006, the Vienna State Opera announced that he had to cancel all his 2006 conducting engagements because of illness, including pneumonia and shingles. He returned to conducting in March 2007 at the Tokyo Opera Nomori. Ozawa stepped down from his post at the Vienna State Opera in 2010, to be succeeded by Franz Welser-Möst. He was named an honorary member of the Vienna Philharmonic then. In 2021, he conducted the orchestra a last time, on a Japan tour featuring the slow movement from Mozart&#x27;s Divertimento, K. 136.

===Personal life===

Ozawa had three brothers, Katsumi, Toshio, and Mikio, the latter becoming a music writer and radio host in Tokyo. Ozawa&#x27;s first wife was the pianist . His second wife was (&quot;Vera&quot;), a Russian-Japanese former model and actress (born in 1944 in Yokohama). He was married to her from 1968 until his death in 2024. The couple had two children, a daughter named Seira and a son named Yukiyoshi. During his tenure with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Ozawa opted to divide his time between Boston and Tokyo rather than move his family to the United States as he and his wife wanted their children to grow up aware of their Japanese heritage.

Ozawa and the cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich formed a traveling musical group during the later stages of Rostropovich&#x27;s life, with the goal of giving free concerts and mentoring students across Japan.

==== Illness and death ====
On January 7, 2010, Ozawa announced that he was canceling all engagements for six months in order to undergo treatments for esophageal cancer. The doctor with Ozawa at the time of the announcement said it was detected at an early stage. Ozawa&#x27;s other health problems included pneumonia and lower back problems requiring surgery in 2011. Following his cancer diagnosis, Ozawa and the novelist Haruki Murakami embarked on a series of six conversations about classical music that form the basis for the book &quot;Absolutely on Music&quot;. 

His last concert took place on November 22, 2022, with the Saito Kinen Orchestra where he conducted, in a wheelchair, Beethoven&#x27;s &#x27;Egmont&#x27; Overture, which was broadcast live to Koichi Wakata, an astronaut onboard the International Space Station.

Ozawa died of heart failure at his home in Tokyo, on February 6, 2024, at the age of 88.

Daniel Froschauer, speaking for the Vienna Philharmonic, wrote: &quot;We are happy to have experienced so many artistic highlights with Seiji Ozawa. It was a gift to be able to go on a long journey with this artist, who was characterized by the highest musical standards and at the same time humility towards the treasures of musical culture as well as his loving interaction with his colleagues and his charisma, which was also felt by the audience.&quot;

His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted: &quot;In the waning years of his life, Mr. Ozawa came to recognize the wisdom that comes from years of music making. &#x27;A musician&#x27;s special flavor comes out with age,&#x27; he told Murakami in the 2016 book of conversations. &#x27;His playing at that stage may have more interesting qualities than at the height of his career.

==Honorary degrees==
Ozawa held honorary doctorate degrees from the Sorbonne University, Harvard University, the New England Conservatory of Music, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, National University of Music Bucharest, and Wheaton College. He was a Member of Honour of the International Music Council.

<doc id="338776" wikidata="Q2499437" url="?curid=338776" title="Eldon Hoke">
<text>Eldon Wayne Hoke (March 23, 1958 – April 19, 1997), nicknamed El Duce, was an American musician best known as the drummer and lead singer of the shock rock band the Mentors, as well as other acts, including Chinas Comidas and the Screamers.

Apart from his musical career, Eldon was also an actor who appeared in several films as an extra, and discussed his hugely-controversial band and lifestyle on the notorious Jerry Springer and Wally George TV talk-shows.

Today El Duce is remembered as a cultural pioneer who, using his dark sense of humor, destroyed taboos in rock music regarding onstage speech and behavior, and who set a precedent for today&#x27;s most outrageous and extreme musical acts.

The Mentors&#x27; songs were covered by artists including Black Label Society, GWAR and Koffin Kats, and quoted by Guns N&#x27; Roses, Anthrax and Dr. Know (in &quot;Cornshucker&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m The Man&quot; and &quot;Fist F*ck&quot;, respectively).
==Early life==

Hoke was born in Seattle, Washington to mother Doris Hope and father Walter Hoke. His father designed bombs for the Vietnam War, and he was also abusive towards him and his sister. He attended Roosevelt High School where he formed the Mentors with school friends Eric Carlson and Steve Broy after he was expelled for repeatedly vandalizing the school.

==Career==

===The Mentors===

Hoke and the Mentors worked to gain attention through farcical demonstrations of political incorrectness. The band&#x27;s guitarist, Eric Carlson, renamed himself &quot;Sickie Wifebeater&quot;, and the group often appeared in public wearing black executioner hoods.

During the 1985 U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation&#x27;s hearings into the proliferation of &quot;obscene&quot; lyrics in popular music, the Reverend Jeff Ling recited the lyrics to the Mentors song, &quot;Golden Shower&quot; to musician Frank Zappa, who opposed the hearings. The lyrics, which included the line, &quot;Bend up and smell my anal vapor/Your face is my toilet paper&quot; prompted Zappa and others to denounce the hearings as a farce.

===Kurt Cobain death claim===

After the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was discovered in the greenhouse of Cobain&#x27;s Lake Washington home on April 8, 1994, Hoke began making the claim that Cobain&#x27;s wife, Courtney Love, had offered to pay him to kill Cobain. Hoke promoted his story in such media outlets as TV&#x27;s &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot;, &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; weekly tabloid, and in Nick Broomfield&#x27;s documentary film, &quot;Kurt &amp; Courtney&quot;. In 1996, Hoke passed a lie detector test when claiming that Love had offered him $50,000 to kill Kurt Cobain. In his interview in the &quot;Kurt and Courtney&quot; film, recorded on April 11, 1997, El Duce again claimed that Love had offered him $50,000 to &quot;whack&quot; Kurt Cobain, and further claimed that he knew who did kill Cobain (giving the name &quot;Allen&quot; some say from the band Kill Allen Wrench), but said he would &quot;let the FBI catch him&quot;.

===Other appearances===
In addition to his musical career, Hoke also worked as an extra in television (such talk shows like &quot;Hot Seat with Wally George&quot; and &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, and &quot;Tales From The Crypt&quot; episode), movies (including the science fiction musical &quot;&quot;, starring his bandmate Tomata Du Plenty; &quot;Two Idiots in Hollywood&quot;, directed by Stephen Tobolowsky; and &quot;Du-beat-e-o&quot;, starring Joan Jett), and in music video productions.

In 1998 &quot;Backstage Sluts&quot; (lately shortened and re-edited as &quot;Backstage Pass: Uncensored&quot;), directed by Matt Zane, was released — a movie wherein famous rockers (including members of Motörhead, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Sugar Ray and Insane Clown Posse) recount their wildest sexual moments, while actual porn stars acted them out. The film contains a penultimate interview with El Duce from 1997, in which he drunkenly declares his taste in the opposite sex: &quot;I like nasty women. I like... homeless women.&quot;

==Death==
On April 19, 1997, one day after his final performance and talking to Brent Alden, and eight days after filming his interview with Nick Broomfield for the &quot;Kurt &amp; Courtney&quot; documentary, Hoke was found dead on the railroad tracks in Riverside, California. He was &quot;decapitated in the accident — he was hit full on by a freight train doing 60 MPH&quot;, according to Steve Broy, the Mentors&#x27; bass player. Subsequent tests indicated a high blood alcohol content and thus Hoke&#x27;s official cause of death was given by the coroner&#x27;s office as &quot;misadventure&quot;. Al Jourgensen (of the industrial metal band Ministry) wrote in his autobiography that El Duce was killed by the train when some fans on the other side of the railroad tracks called his name and, as he attempted to cross to meet them, his toes became stuck in the track. Another story is that he gave a Nazi salute in front of the train as it mowed him down. Due to the timing of his death (eight days after the &quot;Kurt and Courtney&quot; interview), some have speculated that his death was related to the statements he made that Courtney Love offered him $50,000 to &quot;whack&quot; Cobain, and that someone named &quot;Allen&quot; took the offer. 

According to the self-published book &quot;Truth Is Funnier Than Fiction&quot; by Mentors bass player Steve Broy, the whole story was concocted by Mentors associate Rev. Bud Green in order to sell to supermarket tabloids.

<doc id="338785" wikidata="Q185128" url="?curid=338785" title="Denes nad Makedonija">
<text>&quot;&quot; (, ; ) is the national anthem of North Macedonia. Todor Skalovski composed the music and Vlado Maleski wrote the lyrics of the song in the early 1940s. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1992, almost a year after the state&#x27;s independence from Yugoslavia. Before its adoption as a national anthem, it was used as the regional anthem of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, a constituent state of Yugoslavia, before it became the national anthem of the Republic of North Macedonia.

==History==

The lyrics of &quot;Denes nad Makedonija&quot; were penned by Vlado Maleski, a writer who was active in the Partisan movement during World War II. The musical portion was composed by Todor Skalovski. The song was first played in 1942 in Struga, among partisan and communist circles. According to oral recounts, the hymn was played by Maleski himself on New Year&#x27;s Eve in the presence of 24 youths, whose identities were subsequently documented in writing only in 1981. Even though the resistance consisted of fighters from the different ethnic groups across Yugoslavia, the aforementioned youths are believed to have all identified as Macedonians. From the end of the war, it was utilized – albeit unofficially – as the regional anthem of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia (which was part of Yugoslavia at the time) until 1989. In June 1943, the song was published in a collection of Macedonian national liberation songs, edited by Kočo Racin. The lyrics were slightly different, mentioning Nikola Karev and Dimitar Vlahov.

During the Informbiro period, a small change was made in the lyrics. In the new version, the names of Karev and Vlahov were removed and that of Dame Gruev was added. Karev and his brothers were suspected of being Bulgarophiles. Vlahov also was dismissed, because he communicated much better in Bulgarian than in Macedonian and had no political supporters in SR Macedonia, among other reasons. According to Nikola Karev&#x27;s nephew Mishe Karev, the communist elite discussed the idea of removing the name of Gotse Delchev too and not including that of Dame Gruev, and proclaiming them as Bulgarians, but it was declined. On 14 April 1989, the socialist republic&#x27;s Assembly amended the Constitution of 1974, expressly affirming &quot;Denes nad Makedonija&quot; as its official regional anthem. However, this change was short-lived, as the Assembly declared Macedonia&#x27;s sovereignty two years later in January. Macedonia&#x27;s independence was approved on 8 September 1991 in a referendum that saw Macedonians vote overwhelmingly in favour of independence.

Soon after independence, the Macedonian national legislature held a contest to determine a national anthem for the state. &quot;Denes nad Makedonija&quot; was one of several candidates in contention – the others in the running were &quot;Himna&quot; (, ) by Taki Hrisik and &quot;Da ni bideš večna&quot; () by Aleksandar Džambazov – and ended up finishing runner-up in the final results. Despite this, most members of the Assembly Commission voted to make it the national anthem of the state, and it was duly adopted on 11 August 1992. The Albanian political parties did not support the anthem on the basis that it favored one ethnic group and excluded the others. 

===Legal protection and reception===
Macedonia&#x27;s Sobranie (legislative chamber) passed legislation titled &quot;The Law on the Anthem of the Republic of Macedonia&quot; on 11 August 1992. This officially adopted &quot;Denes nad Makedonija&quot; as the national anthem of the country, with Article 2 specifically confirming the song&#x27;s status as such. However, it did not stipulate which stanzas should be recognized as official. Article 5 of the country&#x27;s constitution requires laws regarding national symbols to be approved by a two-thirds majority. Although 88 out of the 120 members of the Assembly voted for it, Albanian representatives were not involved.

In the 2011 IPSOS survey, 84,8% of the respondents said that they liked the anthem, while 15,2% said they did not. Ethnically, 54% of the Albanian respondents said they did not like it and 46% said they did, while 97% of the Macedonian respondents said that they liked it.

==Lyrics==
&quot;Denes nad Makedonija&quot;, as originally written, consists of four stanzas. North Macedonia&#x27;s law does not exactly specify which stanzas officially constitute the national anthem. However, the second stanza is often omitted from the lyrics of the national anthem that are posted on North Macedonia&#x27;s government websites.

The lyrics of &quot;Denes nad Makedonija&quot; are reflective of a military marching song, which is fitting given its connection to the Yugoslav Macedonian theatre of the Second World War. They are not a call to arms for Macedonians; instead, the hymn uses imagery to take the person singing it back to the time the anthem was written and purports that they themselves were engaging in combat at the time. The lyrics previously alluded to the concepts of mothers and motherhood (specifically in the second stanza). This is in line with the national anthems – both past and present – of other Southeast European countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina (&quot;Jedna si jedina&quot;), Croatia (&quot;Horvatska domovina&quot;), and Montenegro (&quot;Oj, svijetla majska zoro&quot;). It discussed how mothers mourn for their fallen sons, who died fighting for the rights and liberty of their country. They are comforted for their loss by being reminded of the bravery of their sons and the nobleness of the cause for which they died. Although this theme has been described as a &quot;standard anthemic device&quot;, it was subsequently expunged from the official words of the state anthem. The lyrics which also mention the inter-generational and inter-gender unity in the fight for rights are omitted.

<text>George Rose (17 June 1744 – 13 January 1818) was a British politician.

==Life==
Born at Woodside near Brechin, Scotland, Rose was the second son of the Reverend David Rose of Lethnot, of an ancient family of Kilravock, in the County of Nairn, titled Baron of Kilravock by his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Donald Rose of Wester Clune (and a descendant of James Sharp, Archbishop of St Andrews from 1661 to 1679, through his daughter, Isabella). David Rose was said to be the illegitimate son of Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont; no illegitimate son is mentioned by Thomas Finlayson Henderson in Marchmont&#x27;s entry in the Dictionary of National Biography, and George Rose&#x27;s own entry in that same edition states: &#x27;Later gossip, which made him out a natural son of Lord Marchmont [see Hume, Hugh, third Earl of Marchmont], an apothecary&#x27;s apprentice, or a purser&#x27;s clerk, may safely be disregarded&#x27;. This indicates the lack of exact detail attached to the claim (as it was in fact George Rose&#x27;s father David that was said to have been Marchmont&#x27;s illegitimate son). Nevertheless there was a strong connection with the Marchmonts: Rev. David Rose became tutor to Marchmont&#x27;s eldest son, Lord Polwarth, and George Rose, on leaving the Royal Navy, was recommended by Marchmont for the position of deputy-chamberlain of the Tally court of the Exchequer, and on Marchmont&#x27;s death, serving as his sole executor, was bequeathed his library, &#x27;consisting of one of the most curious and valuable collections of manuscripts in Great Britain&#x27;. George Rose&#x27;s son, politician Sir George Henry Rose, published in 1831 &#x27;A Selection from the papers of the Earls of Marchmont&#x27;. An account of the relationship between the Marchmonts and the Rose family is given in &#x27;The Diaries and Correspondence of the Right Hon. George Rose&#x27; (1860), edited by Rev. Leveson Vernon Harcourt.

Owing to his father&#x27;s poverty, at the age of four years Rose was sent to live with a maternal uncle who ran a school at Hampstead; he was educated for a short time at Westminster School before entering the Royal Navy, a service which he left in 1762 after he had been wounded in some fighting in the West Indies. He then obtained a position in the civil service, becoming joint Keeper of the Records in 1772 and secretary to the Board of Taxes in 1777. In 1782, he gave up the latter appointment to become one of the secretaries to the treasury under Prime Minister Lord Shelburne, though he did not enter Parliament.

He left office with his colleagues in April 1783, but in the following December he returned to his former position at the Treasury in Pitt&#x27;s ministry, being henceforward one of this minister&#x27;s most steadfast supporters. He entered Parliament as the Member for Launceston early in 1784, and his fidelity and friendship were rewarded by Pitt, who gave him a lucrative post in the Court of Exchequer; in 1788 he became Clerk of the Parliaments. He was also re-elected to Parliament in 1788 to represent Lymington and again in 1790 to represent Christchurch. In 1801, Rose left office with Pitt, but returned with him to power in 1804, when he was made vice-president of the committee on trade and joint Paymaster General. He was made a Privy Councillor in January 1802.

Rose resigned these offices a few days after Pitt&#x27;s death in 1806, but he served as vice-president of the committee on trade and Treasurer of the Navy under the Duke of Portland and Spencer Perceval from 1807 to 1812. In 1807, he was asked to create a new institution, in conjunction with Edward Jenner, to carry out mass vaccinations against smallpox. The National Vaccine Establishment, which is controlled by the Vaccine Board, composed of members of the College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons under the Presidency of Sir Lucas Pepys, was established in 1808.

He was still Treasurer of the Navy under Lord Liverpool and MP for Christchurch, a seat he had held for 28 years, when he died in 1818 at Cuffnells, his house in Lyndhurst, Hampshire. He and many of his family are buried at Christchurch Priory,

Rose was a close friend of Admiral Lord Nelson. He first met Nelson when the latter was a young Captain and had just returned from the West Indies. This friendship grew over the years. Nelson invited Rose to go on board HMS Victory before the ship sailed for the Battle of Trafalgar; his purpose was to tell Rose that, if he was killed, he had left Lady Hamilton and their daughter Horatia to the Nation. Rose was thus the last man in England to see Nelson alive. After Nelson&#x27;s death Rose became Emma Hamilton&#x27;s executor and Horatia&#x27;s guardian; but Pitt&#x27;s death diminished Rose&#x27;s influence and his fellow Ministers did not support her.

Rose was also a friend of King George III and his family who stayed with him a number of times at Cuffnells on their way to summer holidays at Weymouth. Rose also owned a seaside house at Sandhills near Christchurch, now a holiday camp.

Rose was a conscientious politician, although he and his two sons drew a large amount of money from sinecures, a fact referred to by William Cobbett in his &quot;A New Year&#x27;s Gift to old George Rose&quot;.

==Works==
Rose wrote several books on economic subjects, and his &quot;Diaries and Correspondence&quot;, edited by the Rev. L. V. Harcourt, was published in 1860.

==Family==
In 1769, Rose had married Theodora, the daughter of John Duer of Fulham, Middlesex and Antigua, and with her had two sons and a daughter. Theodora was the sister of Founding Father William Duer.

The elder son, Sir George Henry Rose (1771–1855), was in Parliament from 1794 to 1813, and again from 1818 to 1844, and in the meantime was British minister at Munich, at Berlin, and at Washington. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order and in 1818 succeeded his father as Clerk of the Parliaments. He was the father of Field Marshal Baron Strathnairn who was described as one of the bravest men in the British Army and the best commander in the Indian Mutiny.

The second son was the poet William Stewart Rose who was friendly with Sir Walter Scott.

==Legacy==
The historic Australian town (now suburb of Sydney) of Parramatta was originally called Rose Hill after George Rose, but was later renamed. However, the name &quot;Rose Hill&quot; was retained by a neighbouring suburb, Rose Hill.

<text>Jiří Menzel () (23 February 1938 – 5 September 2020) was a Czech film director, theatre director, actor, and screenwriter. His films often combine a humanistic view of the world with sarcasm and provocative cinematography. Some of these films are adapted from works by Czech writers such as Bohumil Hrabal and Vladislav Vančura.

== Early life ==
Menzel was born in Prague in 1938 to Josef Menzel and Božena Jindřichová. His father Josef was a journalist, translator and children&#x27;s book writer. Menzel studied directing at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU) in Prague. His teachers at the academy included Czech Director Otakar Vávra.

== Career ==
Menzel was a member of the Czech New Wave cinema in the 1960s. His first feature film, &quot;Closely Watched Trains&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1967. The film was a World War II drama based on a book by Bohumil Hrabal. His film &quot;Larks on a String&quot; was filmed in 1969, but was banned by the government censors. It was finally released in 1990 after the fall of the Communist regime. The film won the Golden Bear at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival in 1990. The film was also based on a book by Bohumil Hrabal, and spoke about life in a re-education camp in Czechoslovakia under the communist rule in the 1950s.

Menzel was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film again in 1986 with his dark comedy &quot;My Sweet Little Village&quot;. In 1987, he was a member of the jury at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1989 he was a member of the jury at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1995 he was a member of the jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival. He was awarded an IIFA Lifetime Achievement Award in November 2013. He was also awarded the French title of Knight of Arts and Letters and the Czech Lion for lifetime artistic contribution.

In the 1980s he was offered by a West German television studio to make a television series version of The Good Soldier Švejk with Rudolf Hrušínský. He didn&#x27;t get the permission from the Czechoslovak government however.

His last appearance in a feature film was in the 2018 Slovak film, &quot;The Interpreter&quot;, which was based on the story of a man&#x27;s interactions with an SS soldier who had executed his parents. The film was Slovakia&#x27;s official entry to the Oscars.

== Death ==
Menzel died on 5 September 2020, aged 82, after battling a prolonged illness. He had undergone a brain surgery earlier in 2017. He is survived by his wife Olga Menzelová, and daughters, Anna Karolina and Eva Maria. Menzel&#x27;s wife confirmed on 9 November 2020 that Menzel died as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia.

<doc id="338797" wikidata="Q3915826" url="?curid=338797" title="Soliga people">
<text>Soliga, also spelled Solega, Sholaga and Shōlaga, is an ethnic group of India. Its members inhabit the mountain ranges mostly in the Chamarajanagar district of southern Karnataka and Erode district of Tamil Nadu. Many are concentrated in the Biligiriranga Hills and associated ranges, mainly in the talukas Yelandur, Kollegal and Chamarajanagar of Karnataka. The Soliga speak Sholaga, which belongs to the Dravidian family. Under Indian law, they are recognized as a scheduled tribe, they have a population of around 40,000.

==Origin==
The Soliga tribe trace their origin to Karayya, son of Lord Maleya Mahadeshwara, swamy of Maleya Mahadeshwara Hills, Karnataka. Legend says that on seeing Karayya&#x27;s affinity towards wild animals, Lord Maleya Mahadeshwara swamy asked Karayya to reside in forests, whereas the other son Biliyayya resided in plains and became the forefather of Lingayats.

==Language==
The Soliga speak the Sholaga language (Soliganudi) as a mother tongue. A member of the Dravidian family, it is most closely related to Kannada with several Tamil influences.

==Groups==
There are five sub groups of Soligas:

* Male Soliga: Kannada speakers residing in Karnataka
* Urali Soliga: Kannada and Tamil speakers, residing in border areas of Tamil Nadu
* Pujari group: reside in Maleya Mahadeshwara Hills
* Kadu Soliga: reside near Bandipur Forest
* Burude Soliga: reside in Heggadadevanakote Taluk and Kodagu

Furthermore, these groups have several sub-groups.

==Occupation and social status==
The Soliga used to practice shifting cultivation, but have more or less given up this practice now. They grow &quot;Ragi&quot; (Finger millet, &quot;Eleusine coracana&quot;) for subsistence. Their main source of income is harvesting and sale of Non-timber Forest Produce (NTFP) like honey, &quot;nellikai&quot; (gooseberry, &quot;Emblica officinalis&quot;), bamboo, &quot;Paasi&quot; (Lichen), algae, wild turmeric, Indian blackberry, soapnut and nennari (wild root). They also make baskets using bamboo. 
They are increasingly being brought to the &quot;mainstream&quot; with active Government and NGO initiative. Many have been given lands closer to &#x27;civilised areas&#x27; and most of the forest-dwelling population have been brought together into clusters called &quot;Podus&quot;. Most of the forest area they stay comes under wild life protection area. The Biligiriranga Hills is a Wildlife Sanctuary under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the Male Mahadeswara Hills is a Reserve Forest, and Bandipur is a National Park. Their rights on harvesting NTFP is being sought to be withdrawn citing conservation concerns, sparking a debate about the rights of indigenous people. The Soligas later won a court case to stay on their land.

==Religion==
Soliga people follow naturism and animism along with following Hindu practices and their main deities are Madeshwara, Rangaswamy of Biligirirangana Hills (who is considered the brother-in-law of the clan), Karayya, Kyate Devaru and Jadeswamy.her deities worshipped by them include Madeshwara, Basaveshwara and Nanjundeshwara and Sri Alamelu Ranganayaki smetha Sri hanuma.

One theory posits that the Vijayanagara Empire, one of the region&#x27;s most renowned, was founded by Kannadigas who served as commanders in the Hoysala Empire&#x27;s army stationed in the Tungabhadra region. 

The Kannada language has written inscriptions dating back as far as 450 CE. Kannada literature is mostly composed of treatises on various topics and poems on religious works. Kannada architecture is dominated by stone-carved sculptured palaces, temples and traditional wooden folk houses known as thotti mane and chowki mane. Many of religious architectures built during ancient and medieval period are today UNESCO World Heritage sites.

===Music===
Dasa sahitya is the literature of Bhakti movement composed by devotees in honor of Lord Vishnu or one of his avatars. &quot;Dasa&quot; is literally &quot;servant&quot; in Kannada and &quot;sahitya&quot; is literature. &quot;Haridasas&quot; (&quot;servants of God&quot;) were preachers of Bhakti to Vishnu. The bhakti literature of these Haridasas is collectively referred to as Dasa Sahitya. It is composed in the Kannada language.

The Haridasas richly contributed to the heritage of Karntataka music. They made an indelible impression on the religious and cultural life of Karnataka by spreading the didactic teachings in a musical form to the hearts of the common folk. Like other doyens of Indian classical music, these scholars offered prayer to Vishnu through music, called &quot;naadopasana.&quot; The Lord is described as &quot;Samagana priya,&quot; and bhakti through music is the most preferred path to &#x27;reach&#x27; Him.

The Haridasa compositions are popularly known as &quot;Devaranamas.&quot; Compositions like &quot;Krishna Nee Begane Baaro, Venkatachala Nilayam, Jagadoddharana, Tamboori Meetidava&quot; are some of the many examples of their scholarly work.

Some noted Haridasas or composers of Dasa Sahitya are:
* Purandara Dasa, widely regarded as &quot;Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha&quot; or &quot;Father of Carnatic music&quot;
* Kanaka Dasa, a younger contemporary of Purandara Dasa
* Sripadaraja
* Vyasatirtha
* Vadirajatirtha
* Jagannatha Dasa
* Jayatirtha
* Gopala Dasa
* Vijaya Dasa
* Naraharitirtha

One of the oldest forms of music in the region is Karnataka Shastreeya Sangeetha which has evolved over ages. Both Hindustani and Karnataka variations are respected and nurtured by Kannadigas. Bhavageete and Sugama Sangeetha are some innovations. Other forms of music include Gamaka, Joogera Pada and Lavani. Yakshagana is considered a unique and indigenous form of both music and dance of Karnataka.

Kusthi, Malla Yuddha, Kathi Varase (which can be seen depicted in Veeragase and similar to sword fighting), Malla Kambha (gymnastics on a pole structure with/without rope) are some of the prominent arts practised.

The Mysore Odeyars arrange kaalaga or fights like Vajra Mushti during Dasara festival which is made less frightening these days as they are publicly staged. Rock lifting, Bull race, Kusthi, and Kabaddi are popular sports.

Yogasana, Praanayama and health-related camps are very popular throughout the state and some of the best Yoga practitioners can be found here. Art of Living is one such organization immensely popular all over the world.

===Festivals===

Kannadigas celebrate festivals throughout the year presenting the diverse culture and belief of the ethnicity. Festivals have varied reasons to celebrate.
* Agriculture: Upon onset of monsoon, sowing or harvest there are festivals celebrated like Chaandramana Ugaadi (marking of new year), Makara Sankranthi and Huttari.
* Monsoon: Dasara/Navarathri, Ayudha Puja, and Deepavali.
* Puraana: Maha Shivarathri, Varamahalakshmi Vrata, Bheemana Amavasye, Swarna Gowri Vratha, Ganesha Chaturthi, Naagara Panchami, Ratha Sapthami, Krishna Janmashtami, Rama Navami, Vijaya Dashami, Vaikunta Ekadashi, Naraka Chaturdashi, Bali Padyami and others.

In the countryside, a &quot;dana jaathre&quot; (livestock fair) is held which is a conglomeration of people where a local demigod is worshiped and a &quot;ratha&quot; or &quot;theru&quot; (chariots) are moved by the bhakthas and daasoha (free food) is arranged for the visitors.

North Karnataka has a unique blend of Hindu and Muslim brotherhood with people celebrating festivals in unison and exchanging goodwills owing to great revolutionary Shishunala Sharif and Guru Govinda Bhatta who had displayed their religious tolerance and spiritual unity of all religions.

Christmas is celebrated at large in Bengaluru and Mangalooru which host some of the oldest churches and educational institutions of the country. Buddha, Mahaveera, Shankara, Basavanna and Gandhi are remembered on their birth anniversaries.

===Cuisine===

The cuisine of Karnataka includes many vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. One of the earliest Indian books with chapters on culinary preparations, Manasollasa, was from Karnataka, written during the reign of Kannada emperor Someshwara |||. The varieties reflect influences from the food habits of many regions and communities from the three neighbouring South Indian states, as well as the state of Maharashtra to its north. Soopa Shastra is notable medieval Kannada literally work written in 1508 A.D on the subject of Kannada cuisine.

Some typical everyday dishes in Kannadigas homes include Bisi Bele Bath, Jolada rotti, Ragi rotti, Akki rotti, Masale rotti, Saaru, Huli, Benne dose, Ragi mudde, Chitranna, Chapathi, Poori, Avalakki, Puri Usli, Puliyogare (tamarind rice) and Uppittu. Dosa (food) origin is linked to Udupi cuisine. A recipe for dosa (as dosaka) can be found in Manasollasa. Plain and rave Idli, Masala Dosa or Masale dosey and Maddur Vade are very popular in South Karnataka. Neer dosa is a delicacy from coastal Karnataka. Davanagere Benne dose is a notable flavourful dosa. Kadubu, a kind of rice dumplings, is a popular and ethnic food in South Malnad regions such as Sakaleshpura, Mudigere, Somwarapete, etc. and is consumed with (black sesame) chutney.

Among sweets, Mysore Pak, Dharwad pedha, Chiroti, Jalebi, and Belagavi Kunda are well known. Hurnagadab, Karadantu of Gokak and Amingarh, Obbattu (bele hurana holige), Kaayi Kadubu, Kaayi (coconut) Obbattu, Shenga holige, Thambittu (tamta), Karji Kai, Ellu unde, Ginna, Halubai, Rave Unde, Otthu Shavige Kaayi haalu, a variety of Payasa (Shavige payasa, kadle bele payasa, Hesaru bele payasa, Sabakki payasa), Sajjige, and Kesari bat are popular sweets. Indis (chutneys) of Karnataka have a very distinct taste and flavour. Some popular ones include Shenga indi (groundnut), Agashi indi, Karal indi, Inichi indi, and Mavina indi (mango). Similarly, Karnataka (pickles) too are very distinct from the rest, like Mavina (fine mango pickles), (lemon pickles), (entire mango pickle), (carrot pickle), and (chili pickle).

Some non-vegetarian dishes include: Dhonne biriyani, Bamboo biriyani, Mutton pulao, Mangalore fish curry, fish fry, Mangalore mutton and chicken Sukka, Mandya naati style Baaduta, Ragi mudde - Koli saaru, rice with Mutton sambar, Egg curry, Pork curry, chicken sambar, or gravy, and Boti gojju, among others.

===Clothing===

The costume of Kannada people varies from place to place. The Kannadiga male costume mainly includes panche (some tie as Kachche) or lungi (wrapping style depends on the region), Angi a traditional form of shirt and Peta turban worn in Mysuru style or Dharwad style. Shalya is a piece of long cloth which is put on shoulder commonly seen in the countryside. Many use Khadi in their clothing until date of which politicians are prominent ones.

Female costumes include Seere of which Ilakal Seere and Mysore silk are famous. Seere has variations of draping depending on regions like Kodagu, North and South Karnataka and Karavali. Young women in some parts of Karnataka traditionally wear the Langa davani before marriage. Kasuti is a form of embroidery work which is very popularly sought-after art on dress and costumes. 

An urban male costume comprises trousers, a shirt and sandals, while that of females include shalwar. Jeans are popular among the youth, while new age Khadi/silk printed with art or emblem also find place.

==Literature==

Kannada literature is filled with literary figures and pioneers all through. With an unbroken literary history of over a thousand years, the excellence of Kannada literature continues into the present day: works of Kannada literature have received eight Jnanpith awards and fifty-six Sahitya Akademi awards.

Pampa, Ranna and Ponna are considered as three jewels of Old Kannada (&quot;Halegannada&quot;). Janna was another notable poet of this genre.

Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, Vidyaranya, Harihara, Raghavanka, Kumara Vyasa, Sarvajna, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa, Shishunala Shareefa, Raghavendra Swami etc. were pioneers of Nadugannada. All these have been involved with social and cultural movements and hence this was the golden era of literature which brought about a renaissance in Kannada literature. This period was amalgamation of literature works which crossed across boundaries under a vast roof encompassed by art and theater fields. The literature works of Kannada in Navodaya is crowned with eight Jnanpith awards.

Some of the contemporary active institutions of Kannada literature are:
* Kannada Sahitya Parishat
* Academies operating as its wings include Tulu, Konkani, Kodava, and Urdu. A Byari academy is the latest academy opened in Karnataka.

Noted travellers and linguists who contributed during the pre- and post-imperial eras include Germany&#x27;s Ferdinand Kittel, England&#x27;s Thomas Hodson, Persia&#x27;s Abd-al-Razzāq Samarqandī and China&#x27;s Huen-tsang.

==Kannada journalism==
&quot;Mangaluru Samachara&quot; was the first Kannada news publication as early as 1843 by German missionary Hermann Mögling. Followed by Bhashyam Bhashyachar who is credited with publishing the first Kannada weekly from Mysore &quot;Mysuru Vrittanta Bodhini&quot; in 1859 under the royal patronage of Krishnaraja Wadiyar III. Shortly after Indian independence in 1948, K. N. Guruswamy founded &quot;The Printers (Mysore) Private Limited&quot; and began publishing two newspapers, Deccan Herald and Prajavani. Presently the Times of India and Vijaya Karnataka are the largest-selling English and Kannada newspapers respectively. D. V. Gundappa was notable Kannada journalist, he was awarded third-highest civilian award Padmabhushan in 1974.

===Environmentalists===
Karnataka is one of the few states which, while a leading contributor for GDP of the country and home for industries, has preserved its forests and wildlife. The evergreen Sahyadri and Western Ghats are home to protected Wildlife of Karnataka. The Kannada culture protects and balances Kaadu (forest) and Naadu (state) as can be seen. Although seen scantly still the state enjoys the diversity owing to tribal sects of Soliga, Badaga, Jenu Kuruba, Hakki Pikki, Lambani, Siddis and other inhabitants of forests. See Appiko Chaluvali.

==Culture==
===Purana===
The Puranas describe the region as Kishkindha in the age of the Ramayana. There is also literary evidence that the region of Mysore was called &quot;Mahisha Mandala&quot; after the mythological demon Mahishasura. Parashurama and Hanumantha are some epic characters to be cited relating to this place. Hanumantha (Hanuman) is said to be born in Kishkindha, Karnataka.

===Punya Koti===
One of the most popular and acknowledged Jaanapada songs is &quot;Dharani mandala madhyadolage&quot; which narrates an incidence between mother cow and an aggressive tiger in a place called Karnataka.

===Vishwa Maanava===

Karnataka as now can be viewed as a multicultural state – almost all the religions that can be found in India can be found here and there has been lot immigration as well due to which multi-ethnic diaspora can be seen. As the kingdoms provided a safe centres for development of all cultures we can see a huge diversities from region to region. Even the language and dialects varies from place to place. The language has evolved distinctly in both the backyard (folk/basic/prakrutha) and frontyard (refined and related to Samskrutha/Sanskrit) of the culture. It can be said that the major works of Sanskrit have originated and continues to evolve here. Shringeri, Udupi are some of nerve centres. One of the leading examples include a village near Shivamogga where people speak only Sanskrit until date. Bengaluru being Kannada majority has almost all language speakers of India, and kannadigaru are said to be tolerant and welcoming people.
One of the most acknowledged concept is to be a &quot;Vishwa Maanava&quot; or universal being. In Kuvempu&#x27;s ideology this has a renowned explanation &quot;Every Child is born as a Vishwa Maanava or a Universal Human. It is we who make him Alpa Maanava or Little Human by putting various constrictions of borders rituals and castes. It hence becomes responsibility of our culture to again make him a Universal Being unbound and free.&quot; The Kannadiga culture is known to provide shelter and self-respect to people by owning them and their culture. Two colonies for refugees from Tibet are formed, one near Mundgod and one near Kushalanagara, protecting them from Chinese atrocities. Karnataka has sheltered flood victims of northeastern India like Assam and provided them jobs. One of the easily seen diversity is the surnames which vary from hugely like some may involve names involving a Hindu and Muslim name or having a Hindu Christian name (more found in Mangaluru) or even a Muslim Christian name.

===Political sphere===
After the Wadiyar dynasty era who already had established democracy by naming elected representative called Saamantha in southern regions as early as the 19th century, the 1947 partition brought a centre into being under democracy and Karnataka accepted a bicameral legislature. But this was a functionally a failure as there always has been a tug of war from centre and states to an extent that from the 1990s to 2010 there have always been different political parties operating at centre and state. North Karnataka had other problems of getting independence more from Nizams. So there were two spheres. Lack of will and coordination and constant fights have been hallmark of politics which has prevented a regional party/media from arising in the land. Kerala being a neighbour where hugely successful communist ideology in bringing up literacy levels has a backing here and a few naxalite outfits function in Karnataka.

Functional failure of all pillars of democracy even being upper riparian state can be clearly seen in the Kaveri River Water Dispute issue. The failure extended to bureaucracy and Karnataka reached the position of being fourth most corrupt state of India due to political and bureaucratic lobby. Because of this, Lokayukta (see N. Venkatachala) was formed but could not get the required powers to deal with the powerful. In the field of press and journalism P. Lankesh and S. Gurumurthy are some of the noted ones famous for their leftist affiliations.

===Caste and Communities===
Just like other Ethnolinguistic groups in India, Kannada speaking people also form a number of distinct communities. The two single biggest communities numerically are the Lingayat and the Vokkaliga from North and South Karnataka respectively. while Scheduled Castes make up the largest cohesive group of communities. There are also numerous OBC (other backward communities) including the former pastoralist community of Kuruba, Scheduled Tribes like the Boya/Valmiki, scheduled castes like Banjara and Adi Karnataka. Kannada Brahmins are divided into several communities. Although historically Jainism in Karnataka had dominant presence, Kannada Jains today form a small minority. 

===Horanadu Kannadigaru===
Horanadu Kannadigas (or non-resident Kannadigas) are Kannadigas who have migrated to another state or country, people of Kannada origin born outside Karnataka, or people of Kannada origin who reside permanently outside of Karnataka. N R Narayana Murthy, speaking at the 2011 World Kannada Conference, opined that Kannadigas who move out of the state are respected everywhere. Although the failure in political arena has reflected in the cultural isolation of emigrants, some of the successful functional bodies include Singara (Singapore), Dehali Kannadiga (New Delhi), Mumbai Karnataka Sangha (Mumbai), Mallige Kannada Balaga (Mauritius), North America Vishwa Kannada Association (NAVIKA) and Association of Kannada Kootas of America (AKKA) in the United States have promoted cultural involvement through events such as Kannadotsava. Significant Kannada minorities are found in the Indian states of Maharashtra in Kolhapur, Solapur and Sangli; Tamil Nadu in Nilgiri, Erode, Dharampuri and Hosur; Andhra Pradesh in Madakasira, Rayadurgam, Anantapur, Chitoor and Kurnool; Goa; Kerala in Waynad; and in other Indian states. The Kannadiga diaspora are found all over the world, in countries like the USA, the United Kingdom, Canada, and in the UAE.

==Unification of Karnataka==
===First and Second World Wars===
After occupying Mysore, British offered 8 acres &amp; a Rs 75 salary for WWII volunteers from Karnataka. Kannadiga regiments were disbanded after World War II. Records, as historians still debate about exclusion of revolts from south of Vindhyas against British Indian Army.

From September 1939 until August 1945, recruitment was done at Regimental Centre at Belagavi for the Madras Regiment, the Mahar Regiment, and the Lingayat regiment.

===The post-1947 scene===
During the period of British rule, state of Karnataka as it stands today did not exist. Areas that today comprise Karnataka were under as many as 20 different administrative units with the princely state of Mysore, Nizam&#x27;s Hyderabad, the Bombay Presidency, the Madras Presidency and the territory of Kodagu being the most important ones. In effect, nearly two-thirds of what is now Karnataka fell outside the rule of the Wodeyar kings of Mysore. In addition the proposed state had six neighbours — Goa, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala — and all had Kannadigas along the borders overlapping these regions.

What this meant for the Kannadigas in these regions was that they were reduced to linguistic minorities wherever they were. Kannadigas in the Hubli-Karnataka region for example, came under the rule of the Bombay presidency where Marathi was the official language. Those in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region came under the Nizam&#x27;s rule where Urdu ruled, while in Mysore Kingdom, Kannada was the official language.

It was in this backdrop that the movement that first started as a protest against linguistic oppression, soon morphed into one that began demanding a separate state be created consolidating all Kannada speaking regions. This was essentially a movement that was spearheaded by the poets, journalists and writers and was called the &quot;Ekikarana&quot; or &#x27;Unification&#x27; movement.
India gained independence in 1947. The joy of independence soon gave way to disappointment as the new government started dragging its feet on &quot;Karnataka Ekikarana&quot; movement. Kannada speaking areas now got grouped under five administrative units of the Bombay and Madras provinces, Kodagu, and the princely states of Mysore and Hyderabad. The &quot;Akhila Karnataka Ekikarana Parishat&quot; met in Kasargod and reiterated the demand for a separate state for Kannadigas.

The ratification in parliament of the recommendations of the Fazal Ali Committee brought joy to the Kannada speaking population that now was merged under the state of Mysore.

On 1 November 1973, under Devaraj Urs as chief minister, Mysore state was renamed as Karnataka since it was felt that Karnataka was more &#x27;inclusive&#x27; of all the other regions of Karnataka than the name Mysore.

Kannada unification organisations currently active include:
*Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha
*Karnataka Ekikarana Samithi
*Karnataka Rakshana Vedike
*Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha

<text>Thomas Wyatt Turner (March 16, 1877 – April 21, 1978) was an American civil rights activist, biologist, and educator. He was the first Black American to receive a Ph.D. in botany, and helped found both the NAACP and the Federated Colored Catholics.

== Biography ==

===Early life and education===
Turner was born in Hughesville, Maryland. His parents, Eli and Linnie (née Gross), were sharecroppers and he was the fifth of their nine children. When he was eight, his father died and he was sent to live with an aunt and uncle, James Henry and Rose Turner. Turner worked in the fields but also attended Episcopal local schools from 1892 onwards after Catholic schools refused to admit him because of his race. From 1895 to 1897, he attended the Howard University Preparatory School.

He studied at Howard University gaining B. S. (1901) and M. A. (1905) degrees. In 1901, he attended the Catholic University of America briefly to further improve his scientific knowledge but had to leave because it was too expensive. In 1921, he obtained a PhD in botany from Cornell University—becoming the first Black person to gain a doctorate from Cornell and the first to receive a doctorate in that field at any institution. His dissertation was entitled &quot;The physiological effects of salts in altering the ratio of top to root growth&quot; and came from work done with Otis Freeman Curtis during summer leaves-of-absence from his post as Dean at Howard University.

=== Career ===
After graduation, Turner headed to the Tuskegee Institute, Alabama at the request of Booker T. Washington, where he taught academics in biology for a year. From 1902 he gave service to various public schools in Baltimore, Maryland for a decade, except for a year (1910–1911) at the St Louis High School in St Louis, Missouri.

In 1909, he became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as the first secretary of the Baltimore branch, and was also active in promoting the right of Blacks to vote. He continued this activism after his appointment to Howard University. In 1915 he organized a city–wide membership drive for the Washington NAACP. He was eventually honored with a lifetime membership in the NAACP.

From 1914 to 1924, he served as a Professor of Botany at Howard University in Washington, D.C., which had provided courses in botany since 1867. He was the founding head when the Department of Botany was established in 1922. He also served from 1914 to 1920 as Acting Dean at the Howard&#x27;s School of Education. As well as biology he felt that the mentorship provided by teachers and faculty had a vital impact on student&#x27;s careers. Turner was initiated as a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity in 1915.

In 1915, he began lobbying the Catholic University of America to admit Black students and for the Catholic church to provide high school education for Black Catholic children—as well as a route to the priesthood for young Black men who had a vocation (specifically via the Josephites). He would later become one of the Committee of Fifteen, which targeted such issues.

While working at Cornell University in 1918, Turner worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Maine, where he examined potato fields. The American government consulted Turner throughout his career about agricultural problems. Under the auspices of the US Secretary of Agriculture, Turner worked as a collaborator on Virginia&#x27;s plant diseases.

In 1924, Turner became a professor of botany and the department head at the Hampton Institute.

On December 29, 1924, Turner founded (and was elected president of) the Federated Colored Catholics, an organization that he said was &quot;composed of Catholic Negroes who placed their services at the disposal of the Church for whatever good they were able to effect in the solution of the problems facing the group in Church and country&quot;. The FCC, founded to be a haven for Black Catholics and their goals/rights, would later disband due to two White co-leaders (and Jesuits) who sought a more interracial bent for the organization—against Turner&#x27;s will.

In 1931, Turner organized the Virginia Conference of College Science Teachers in 1931, and served as president of that group for two terms. Turner also was an active member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the American Society for Horticultural Science.

=== Later life and death ===
He retired in 1945 due to glaucoma.

In 1976, aged 99, Turner was awarded an honorary doctorate by The Catholic University of America.

He died in 1978, 36 days after turning 101.

== Personal life ==
His first wife was Laura Miller. In 1936, he married Louise Wright.

Turner was active in Catholic organizations and in societies for the advancement of African-Americans. He remained a loyal member of the Church despite suffering discrimination; he wrote of being asked to move to the back of the church when attending Mass in St. Louis in 1926.

==Legacy==
His papers and unpublished autobiography were among the Turner Papers at the Moorland–Spingarn Research Center as of 1988. His memoir was published independently in 2018.

In 1976, the National Office for Black Catholics (NOBC) began awarding the annual Dr. Thomas Wyatt Turner Award for work towards equal rights.

In 1978, the Hampton Institute named its new natural sciences building Turner Hall.

The Cornell Graduate School created the Turner Kittrell Medal of Honor for alumni who have made significant national or international contributions to the advancement of diversity, inclusion and equity in academia, industry or the public sector. The first award was in 2017.

<text>Dysderidae, also known as woodlouse hunters, sowbug-eating spiders, and cell spiders, is a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1837. They are found primarily in Eurasia, extending into North Africa with very few species occurring in South America. &quot;Dysdera crocata&quot; is introduced into many regions of the world.

Dysderids generally have six eyes, and are haplogyne, i.e. the females lack a sclerotized epigyne. There is a substantial number of genera, but two of them, &quot;Dysdera&quot; and &quot;Harpactea&quot;, account for a very large number of the species and are widespread across the family&#x27;s range. One species, &quot;Dysdera crocata&quot; (the woodlouse hunter), has been transported over much of the planet together with its preferred foods—woodlice. &quot;Dysdera&quot; also feeds on beetles. These spiders have very large chelicerae, which they use to pierce the armored bodies of woodlice and beetles. There are also some reports that they have a mildly toxic venom that can cause local reactions in humans.

The spiders have their six eyes arranged in a semicircle like segestrids, but have only the first two pairs of legs produced forward. &quot;Dysdera crocata&quot; has a characteristic coloring, which can only be confused with spiders in the trachelid genera &quot;Trachelas&quot; and &quot;Meriola&quot;: the carapace is dull red-brown and the abdomen gray or tan.

<doc id="338806" wikidata="Q2356541" url="?curid=338806" title="Czechoslovak New Wave">
<text>The Czechoslovak New Wave (also Czech/Slovak New Wave) is a term used for the Czechoslovak filmmakers who started making films in the 1960s. The directors commonly included are Miloš Forman, Věra Chytilová, Ivan Passer, Pavel Juráček, Jiří Menzel, Jan Němec, Jaromil Jireš, Evald Schorm, Hynek Bočan, Juraj Herz, Juraj Jakubisko, Štefan Uher, František Vláčil and others. The movement was sometimes called the &quot;Czechoslovak film miracle&quot;.

== Overview ==
The films touched on themes which for earlier film makers in the communist countries had rarely managed to avoid the objections of the censor, such as the misguided youths of Czechoslovak society portrayed in Miloš Forman&#x27;s &quot;Black Peter&quot; (1963) and &quot;Loves of a Blonde&quot; (1965), or those caught in a surrealistic whirlwind in Věra Chytilová&#x27;s &quot;Daisies&quot; (1966) and Jaromil Jireš&#x27; &quot;Valerie and Her Week of Wonders&quot; (1970). The films often expressed dark and absurd humour in opposition to social realist films of the 1950s.

The Czechoslovak New Wave differed from the French New Wave in that it usually held stronger narratives, and as these directors were the children of a nationalized film industry, they had greater access to studios and state funding. They also made more adaptations, including Jaromil Jireš&#x27;s adaptation of Milan Kundera&#x27;s novel &quot;The Joke&quot; (1969). At the Fourth Congress of the Czechoslovak Writers Union in 1967, Milan Kundera described this wave of national cinema as an important part of the history of Czechoslovak literature. Forman&#x27;s &quot;The Firemen&#x27;s Ball&quot; (1967), another major film of the era, remains a cult film more than four decades after its release.

== Czech film ==
The majority of films shot during the New Wave were Czech-language as opposed to Slovak. Many directors came from the prestigious FAMU, located in Prague, while the state-run Barrandov Studios were located just on the outskirts of Prague. Some prominent Czech directors included Miloš Forman, who directed &quot;The Firemen&#x27;s Ball&quot;, &quot;Black Peter&quot;, and &quot;Loves of a Blonde&quot; during this time, Věra Chytilová who is best known for her film &quot;Daisies&quot;, and Jiří Menzel, whose film &quot;Closely Watched Trains&quot; (&quot;Ostře sledované vlaky&quot; 1966) won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

== Slovak film ==
&quot;The Shop on Main Street&quot; (1965) won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1966, although it is not considered part of the New Wave, because it was directed by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos, who were a generation older, and the film is fairly traditional. Juraj Jakubisko, Štefan Uher and Dušan Hanák were Slovak filmmakers who were part of the New Wave.
