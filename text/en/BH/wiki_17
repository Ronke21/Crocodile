<text>Huang Zhong (, ) (died 220), courtesy name Hansheng, was a Chinese military general serving under the warlord Liu Bei during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He is best known for his victory at the Battle of Mount Dingjun in 219, in which his force routed that of an enemy general, Xiahou Yuan, who was killed in action during the raid.

Huang Zhong is portrayed in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and popular culture as an elderly general with youthful vigour and constitution, and as one of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei.

==Early life==
Huang Zhong was from Nanyang Commandery, which is around present-day Nanyang, Henan. He initially served as a General of the Household (中郎將) under Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province. He was tasked to defend Changsha Commandery with Liu Biao&#x27;s nephew, Liu Pan. Liu Biao died in 208 and his successor, Liu Cong, surrendered Jing Province to the warlord Cao Cao. Huang Zhong was appointed as an acting Major-General (裨將軍) and he continued serving in Changsha under Han Xuan, the commandery administrator.

==Service under Liu Bei==
Following Cao Cao&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the same year, the victorious allied forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan gradually took over the various commanderies in southern Jing Province, including Changsha. Han Xuan surrendered Changsha, and Huang Zhong came to serve under Liu Bei. Since receiving a military appointment at Jiameng (葭萌; present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan), Huang Zhong had performed well in Liu Bei&#x27;s conquest of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from 212 to 214, – he was always the first to charge into enemy formations and among the army; none could match his martial prowess and bravery. After Yi Province was taken, Huang Zhong was promoted to General Who Attacks Rebels (討虜將軍).

===Success in the Hanzhong Campaign===
In 217, Liu Bei started a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery, which was under Cao Cao&#x27;s control. His force encountered resistance led by Xiahou Yuan at Yangping Pass. The confrontation dragged on for more than a year until one night in 219, when Liu Bei set fire to the barbed fence around Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s camp at the foot of Mount Dingjun. Alarmed by the attack, Xiahou Yuan sent Zhang He to defend the eastern corner of the camp while he guarded the south. Liu Bei&#x27;s main force pressed against Zhang He, outmatching the latter. Xiahou Yuan dispatched a fraction of his own troops to help Zhang He. Even though Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s soldiers were far more experienced, Huang Zhong still rallied his men and accompanied by thundering drums with impressive shouts, they descended upon Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s force. The battle became a rout and Xiahou Yuan was killed in action. The victory at Mount Dingjun was a major stepping stone to the conquest of Hanzhong. Huang Zhong was promoted to General Who Attacks the West (征西將軍) for his contributions in the Hanzhong Campaign.

In the same year, Liu Bei proclaimed himself &quot;King of Hanzhong&quot; (漢中王) – a symbolic move comparing himself to Emperor Gao, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty. He wanted to appoint Huang Zhong as General of the Rear (後將軍), placing the latter on the same level as three other senior generals: Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Ma Chao. However, Zhuge Liang told Liu Bei: &quot;Huang Zhong&#x27;s fame is far from that of Guan Yu and Ma Chao. If they are all given equal status, Zhang Fei and Ma Chao will probably not object because they have been with Huang Zhong all this while and have witnessed his contributions, but Guan Yu is stationed far away and he may not agree with this arrangement.&quot; Liu Bei answered: &quot;I will handle this myself.&quot; and tasked Fei Shi with travelling to Jing Province to inform Guan Yu about his appointment. Then, he elevated all the four generals to the same status. Huang Zhong also received the title of a Secondary Marquis (關內侯).

==Death==
Huang Zhong died in 220 and his cause of death was not specified. In October or November 260, Liu Shan awarded Huang Zhong the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Gang&quot; (剛侯), which literally means &quot;unyielding marquis&quot;. Huang Zhong&#x27;s son, Huang Xu (黃叙), had already died at a young age before him and did not have any descendants.

Huang Zhong&#x27;s tomb was first discovered in Chengdu during the Qing dynasty in 1825. The tomb was repaired and a temple dedicated to him was built next to it. The temple, the statue, the plaques, and the tomb were heavily damaged with its coffin emptied during the Cultural Revolution.

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou, who wrote Huang Zhong&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on the latter as follows: &quot;Huang Zhong and Zhao Yun were fierce and mighty warriors, just like claws and teeth. Were they the successors to Guan and Teng?&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Huang Zhong is featured as a prominent character in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Huang Zhong was named one of the Five Tiger Generals by Liu Bei after Liu emerged victorious in the Hanzhong Campaign in 219. In the novel, Huang Zhong is portrayed as an elderly warrior highly skilled in archery.

* Battle of Mount Dingjun#In fiction
* Battle of Xiaoting#Huang Zhong&#x27;s death

==In popular culture==
Huang Zhong is featured as a playable character in the video game series &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, &quot;Kessen II&quot;, and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; produced by Koei, as well as in the Capcom game &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; released for the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

Huang Zhong is featured on a card in the Three Kingdoms Portal of the card game &quot;&quot;.

A Chinese-Canadian youth organization and martial arts club specializing in traditional Chinese cultural arts, the Hon Hsing Athletic Club of Vancouver (雲高華漢升體育會), British Columbia, was established in 1939 under the patronage of the Wongs&#x27; Benevolent Association of Canada. It is named after Huang Zhong&#x27;s courtesy name, Hansheng (漢升; Cantonese: &quot;Hon Hsing&quot;).

Huang Zhong is a potential skin for the character Hanzo Shimada in the video game &quot;Overwatch&quot;. It was released in 2019 as part of the Chinese New Year event &quot;Year of the Pig&quot;.

USS &quot;Huang Zhong&quot; is the name of an &quot;Archer&quot;-class scoutship which appears in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;That Which Divides,&quot; by Dayton Ward.

Huang Zhong appears in &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot; as a playable character, serving under Liu Biao&#x27;s faction.

<doc id="325426" wikidata="Q336489" url="?curid=325426" title="James Parkinson">
<text>James Parkinson (11 April 1755 – 21 December 1824) was an English surgeon, apothecary, geologist, palaeontologist and political activist. He is best known for his 1817 work &quot;An Essay on the Shaking Palsy&quot;, in which he was the first to describe &quot;paralysis agitans&quot;, a condition that would later be renamed Parkinson&#x27;s disease by Jean-Martin Charcot.

==Early life==

James Parkinson was born on 11 April 1755 in Shoreditch, London, England. He was the son of John Parkinson, an apothecary and surgeon practising in Hoxton Square in London, and the oldest of five siblings, including his brother William and his sister Mary Sedgwick. In 1784 Parkinson was approved by the City of London Corporation as a surgeon.

On 21 May 1783, he married Mary Dale, with whom he subsequently had eight children; two did not survive past childhood. Soon after he was married, Parkinson succeeded his father in his practice in 1 Hoxton Square.

==Politics==
In addition to his flourishing medical practice, Parkinson had an avid interest in geology and palaeontology, as well as the politics of the day.

Parkinson was a strong advocate for the underprivileged, and an outspoken critic of the Pitt government. His early career was marked by his being involved in a variety of social and revolutionary causes, and some historians think he most likely was a strong proponent for the French Revolution. He published nearly 20 political pamphlets in the post-French Revolution period, while Britain was in political chaos. Writing under his own name and his pseudonym &quot;Old Hubert&quot;, he called for radical social reforms and universal suffrage.

Parkinson called for representation of the people in the House of Commons, the institution of annual parliaments. He was a member of several secret political societies, including the London Corresponding Society and the Society for Constitutional Information. In 1794, his membership in the organisation led to him being examined under oath before William Pitt and the Privy Council to give evidence about a trumped-up plot to assassinate King George III. He refused to testify regarding his part in the Popgun Plot until he was certain he would not be forced to incriminate himself. The plan was to use a poisoned dart fired from a pop-gun to bring the king&#x27;s reign to a premature conclusion. No charges were ever brought against Parkinson, but several of his friends languished in prison for many months before being acquitted.

==Medicine==

Parkinson turned away from his tumultuous political career, and between 1799 and 1807 published several medical works, including a work on gout in 1805. He was also responsible for early writings on ruptured appendix.

Parkinson was interested in improving the general health and well-being of the population. He wrote several medical doctrines that revealed a zeal for the health and welfare of the people similar to that expressed in his political activism. He was a crusader for legal protection for the mentally ill, as well as their doctors and families.

In 1812, Parkinson assisted his son with the first described case of appendicitis in English, and the first instance in which perforation was shown to be the cause of death.

He believed that any worthwhile surgeon should know shorthand, at which he was adept.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===

Parkinson was the first person to systematically describe six individuals with symptoms of the disease that bears his name. In &quot;An Essay on the Shaking Palsy&quot; (1817), he reported on three of his own patients and three persons whom he saw in the street. He referred to the disease that would later bear his name as paralysis agitans, or shaking palsy. He distinguished between resting tremors and the tremors with motion. Jean-Martin Charcot coined the term &quot;Parkinson&#x27;s disease&quot; some 60 years later.

Parkinson erroneously suggested that the tremors in these patients were due to lesions in the cervical spinal cord.

==Science==
Parkinson&#x27;s interest gradually turned from medicine to nature, specifically the relatively new fields of geology and palaeontology. He began collecting specimens and drawings of fossils in the latter part of the 18th century. He took his children and friends on excursions to collect and observe fossil plants and animals. His attempts to learn more about fossil identification and interpretation were frustrated by a lack of available literature in English, so he took the decision to improve matters by writing his own introduction to the study of fossils.

In 1804, the first volume of his &quot;Organic Remains of a Former World&quot; was published. Gideon Mantell praised it as &quot;the first attempt to give a familiar and scientific account of fossils&quot;. A second volume was published in 1808, and a third in 1811. Parkinson illustrated each volume and his daughter Emma coloured some of the plates. The plates were later reused by Gideon Mantell. In 1822, Parkinson published the shorter &quot;Outlines of Oryctology: an Introduction to the Study of Fossil Organic Remains, especially of those found in British Strata&quot;.

Parkinson also contributed several papers to William Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;A Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts&quot;, and in the first, second, and fifth volumes of the &quot;Geological Society&#x27;s Transactions&quot;. He wrote a single volume &quot;Outlines of Oryctology&quot; in 1822, a more popular work. On 13 November 1807, Parkinson and other distinguished gentlemen met at the Freemasons&#x27; Tavern in London. The gathering included such great names as Sir Humphry Davy, Arthur Aikin, and George Bellas Greenough. This was to be the first meeting of the Geological Society of London.

Parkinson belonged to a school of thought, catastrophism, that concerned itself with the belief that the Earth&#x27;s geology and biosphere were shaped by recent large-scale cataclysms. He cited the Noachian deluge of Genesis as an example, and he firmly believed that creation and extinction were processes guided by the hand of God. His view on Creation was that each &quot;day&quot; was actually a much longer period, that lasted perhaps tens of thousands of years.

==Death and memorials==
Parkinson died on 21 December 1824, after a stroke that interfered with his speech. He bequeathed his houses in Langthorne to his sons and wife, and his apothecary&#x27;s shop to his son John. His collection of organic remains was given to his wife, and much of it was sold in 1827; a catalogue of the sale has never been found. He was buried at St. Leonard&#x27;s Church, Shoreditch.

Parkinson&#x27;s life is commemorated with a stone tablet inside the church of St Leonard&#x27;s, Shoreditch, where he was a member of the congregation; the exact site of his grave is not known and his body may lie in the crypt or in the churchyard. A blue plaque at 1 Hoxton Square marks the site of his home. Several fossils were named after him. No portrait of him is known. A photograph sometimes identified as an image of him is of a dentist of the same name; he died before the invention of photography.

World Parkinson&#x27;s Day is held each year on his birthday, 11 April. In addition to the eponymous disease, Parkinson is commemorated in the names of several fossil organisms, including the ammonite &quot;Parkinsonia parkinsoni&quot;, the crinoid &quot;Apiocrinus parkinsoni&quot;, the snail &quot;Rostellaria parkinsoni&quot;, and the tree &quot;Nipa parkinsoni&quot;.

<text>Margaret Colin (born May 26, 1958) is an American actress. She is known for her roles as Constance Spano in &quot;Independence Day&quot;, Margo Hughes on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and as Eleanor Waldorf-Rose on &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;.

==Early life==
Margaret Colin was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and was raised in Baldwin, New York, on Long Island. She is of Irish descent and was raised in a large Catholic family. She graduated from Baldwin Senior High School in 1976, and after attended Hofstra University.

==Career==
Colin began her acting career in the soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, playing an heiress and former terrorist. In seven months on that show, her character survived seven murder attempts and ended up marrying her stepbrother. She followed that role with a longer stint on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, originating the role of Margo Montgomery, a character that endured nearly 30 years.

She has appeared on a number of primetime television shows, starting with &quot;Foley Square&quot;, &quot;Leg Work&quot;, and several early episodes of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. She played Lisa Wiseman on the 1999 series &quot;Now and Again&quot;, with Eric Close and Dennis Haysbert. In 2003, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; titled &quot;Tortured&quot;, playing a mother/bakery owner who was later arrested for abetting a murder.

From 2007 to 2012, Colin played the recurring role of Eleanor Waldorf, mother of Blair Waldorf, on the teen drama television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. In the pilot episode, Eleanor was played by &quot;One Life to Live&quot; actress Florencia Lozano.

Colin has also been in a number of films, some of the most well-known including &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986), &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; (1987), &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1991), &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; (1997), &quot;Unfaithful&quot; (2002), and &quot;First Daughter&quot; (2004). She also appeared in the play &quot;Jackie: An American Life&quot;, in which she played Jacqueline Kennedy.

During her 2003 performance of the English play &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; on Broadway, Colin smoked her way through the second half of the show and dedicated the performance to Mayor Michael Bloomberg in defiance of the state&#x27;s smoking ban. After the play finished its run, she gave up smoking.

In 2017, Colin appeared as a recurring character throughout the sixth season of the HBO comedy series &quot;Veep&quot;, playing fictional CBS News anchor Jane McCabe. Along with her fellow cast members, Colin won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. In 2019, she reprised her role as McCabe in the seventh season premiere of &quot;Veep&quot; and again in the series finale.

Colin performed on Broadway as Mrs. Mullin in the 2018 revival of &quot;Carousel&quot;.

==Personal life==
Colin met actor Justin Deas when he played her love interest, Tom Hughes, on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. They were married in January 1988. The couple have two sons, Sam and Joe, and Colin is stepmother of her husband&#x27;s daughter from his first marriage. The family moved to Upper Montclair, New Jersey in the late 1990s.

She is a pro-life activist and was formerly the honorary co-chair of Feminists for Life, an organization opposed to abortion. Colin is an honorary board member of the group Feminists for Nonviolent Choices.

<text>Oleg Antonovich Gordievsky (; born 10 October 1938) is a former colonel of the KGB who became KGB resident-designate (&quot;rezident&quot;) and bureau chief in London. 

He was a double agent, providing information to the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) from 1974 to 1985. After being recalled to Moscow under suspicion, he was exfiltrated from the Soviet Union in July 1985 under a plan code-named Operation Pimlico. The Soviet Union subsequently sentenced him to death &quot;in absentia&quot;.

==Early life and education==
The son of an officer of the NKVD (the Soviet secret police and precursor to the KGB), Gordievsky was born in 1938. He proved an excellent student at school, where he learned to speak German.

He studied at a prestigious Moscow University – Moscow State Institute of International Relations – and later undertook NKVD training, where in addition to espionage skills he mastered German and also learned to speak Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian.

==Career==
On completion of his studies, Gordievsky joined the foreign service and was posted to East Berlin in August 1961, just before the erection of the Berlin Wall. The building of the wall appalled him, and he became disillusioned with the Soviet system. After spending a year in Berlin, he returned to Moscow. 

Gordievsky joined the KGB in 1963, and was posted to the Soviet embassy in Copenhagen in 1966. He became outraged by the USSR&#x27;s cruel crushing of the Prague Spring reform movement in Czechoslovakia in August 1968, and began sending covert signals to Danish and British intelligence agents and agencies that he might be willing to cooperate with them. In 1974 he agreed to pass secrets to MI6, a step he viewed as &quot;nothing less than undermining the Soviet system&quot;. MI6 gave him the codename SUNBEAM. His second posting to Denmark ended in 1978, and he was recalled to Moscow – this time for a lengthy period because he quickly divorced his wife and married a woman he had been having an affair with, and the KGB frowned upon affairs and divorces as immoral. During this Moscow period, it was too risky for him to send any information to MI6.

After he learned to speak English and lobbied heavily for a position that opened up in London, the KGB posted Gordievsky to London in June 1982. He steadily advanced in rank there with the help of secret aid and manipulation by MI6, which handed him abundant non-damaging information and contacts; MI6 also steadily banished his direct superiors back to Moscow on trumped-up charges so that Gordievsky took their place. He continued to provide secret documents and information to MI6. While in London, his MI6 code name was NOCTON. The CIA – told of MI6&#x27;s high-level informant but not his name or position – gave him the codename TICKLE.

In late April 1985 he was promoted to KGB station chief (resident-designate or &quot;rezident&quot;) in London at the Soviet embassy. He was suddenly summoned back to Moscow via a telegram on 16 May 1985. MI6 allowed him to make his own decision whether to immediately defect to the UK and live thenceforth in secrecy under their protection, or to go to Moscow with the understanding that he could be interrogated, tortured, or killed if the KGB suspected his betrayal. Gordievsky felt, given the huge benefits MI6 would reap if he remained &quot;rezident&quot; of the embassy, that he was being encouraged by MI6 to return to Moscow as ordered, and decided on that; MI6 began to revive a plan to extricate him if necessary. 

Unbeknownst to him, Gordievsky had been betrayed in early May (or early June 1985 at the latest) by CIA officer Aldrich Ames. After returning to Moscow on 19 May 1985, Gordievsky was drugged and interrogated, but not yet criminally charged; instead he was placed in a non-existent desk job in a nonoperational department of the KGB. Under increasing surveillance and pressure in Moscow and seriously suspected of being a double agent, in July 1985 he managed to send a pre-arranged covert signal to MI6 to be rescued. 

Following his exfiltration from the USSR to the UK in 1985, he became of even greater use to the West, in that information he would disclose or had previously disclosed could be immediately acted upon and shared without endangering his life, identity, or position.

==British secret agent==
During his first Danish posting, Gordievsky became disenchanted with his work in the KGB, particularly after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. He tried to send a covert sympathetic message to the (PET, Danish Security Intelligence Service) but his three-year stint ended and he returned to Moscow before making any direct contact. By the time he arrived again in Copenhagen in October 1972 for a second three-year stint, both the PET and MI6 – which had been tipped off by one of Gordievsky&#x27;s old university friends – felt he was a persuadable agent. MI6 subsequently made contact with Gordievsky, and began running him as a double agent in 1974.

The value of MI6&#x27;s recruitment of such a highly placed intelligence asset increased dramatically when, in 1982, the KGB posted Gordievsky to London, and he rose through the ranks there, gaining the ability to access higher and higher levels of Soviet secrets, which he passed easily to MI6 via a London safe house.

Two of Gordievsky&#x27;s most important contributions were averting a potential nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union, when the Soviets misinterpreted the NATO exercise Able Archer 83 as a potential first strike, and identifying Mikhail Gorbachev as the Soviet heir-apparent long before he came to prominence. Indeed, the information passed by Gordievsky became the first proof of how worried the Soviet leadership had become about the possibility of a NATO nuclear first strike.

===Sudden recall to Moscow===
Gordievsky was suddenly ordered back to Moscow in mid May 1985, a few weeks after he had been promoted to KGB station chief in London. Although MI6 allowed him the option to instead defect and stay in London under their protection, on 19 May 1985 he left for Moscow. After his arrival, he was taken to a KGB safe house outside Moscow, drugged, and interrogated. He was questioned for about five hours. After that, he was released and told that he would never work abroad again. He was suspected of espionage for a foreign power, but his superiors stalled on taking any overt further action against him.

Although MI6 had passed on information provided by Gordievsky to the American CIA, the British would not reveal their source, so the CIA had conducted a covert operation to discover who the source was. After about a year, they realized that it must be Gordievsky. Soon a high-ranking American CIA officer, Aldrich Ames, began selling secrets to the KGB and reported Gordievsky&#x27;s treachery to Soviet counterintelligence. Ames first met and sold classified information to a KGB agent on 15 May 1985, in Washington, D.C.; the following day Gordievsky received the telegram from KGB leadership recalling him to Moscow. A 1994 report by the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, however, stated that &quot;After six weeks of questioning Ames ... the FBI and CIA remain baffled about whether Ames or someone else first warned the Soviets about Gordievsky&quot;. An FBI report later stated that Ames had not advised the Soviets about Gordievsky until 13 June 1985; by that time, Gordievsky was under KGB surveillance but he had not yet been charged with treason as of 19 July 1985 when MI6 agents began the process of his escape. Nevertheless, biographer Ben Macintyre and most people involved in the Gordievsky case believe that during his first visit with the KGB in Washington in early May 1985, Ames provided sufficient information to prompt an investigation by Colonel Viktor Budanov, the KGB&#x27;s top investigator, and trigger Gordievsky&#x27;s recall.

===Escape from the USSR===
An elaborate escape plan from the USSR had been already devised for Gordievsky by MI6 in 1978, when the KGB called him back to Moscow for a few years after his second three-year stint in Copenhagen. The escape plan was code-named &quot;Operation Pimlico&quot;, and was devised by an MI6 officer named Valerie Pettit.

Although he almost certainly remained under KGB surveillance, Gordievsky managed to send a covert signal to MI6, which activated the elaborate escape plan, Pimlico, that had been in place for many years for just such an emergency. He waited on a particular street corner, on a particular weekday at 7.30 pm, carrying a Safeway bag as a signal. An MI6 agent walked past carrying a Harrods bag, eating a Mars bar, and the two made eye contact. These mutual signals indicated that the escape plan was to be activated immediately.

On 19 July 1985, Gordievsky went for his usual jog, but he instead managed to evade his KGB tails and boarded a train to Leningrad and then travelled on to a rendezvous south of Vyborg, near the Finnish border. There he was met by British embassy cars, after they managed to lose the three KGB surveillance cars following them. Lying down in the boot (trunk) of a Ford Sierra saloon, he was smuggled across the border into Finland. Two British diplomats and their wives were Gordievsky&#x27;s courier; to dissuade sniffer dogs at the Finnish border one of the wives dropped her baby&#x27;s dirty nappy on the ground, causing the dogs to flee. Gordievsky was flown to the UK via Norway; in the UK, his MI6 codename was changed to OVATION.

Soviet authorities subsequently sentenced Gordievsky to death &quot;in absentia&quot; for treason, a sentence never rescinded by post-Soviet Russian authorities, but which could not be legally carried out because of Russia&#x27;s then-membership in the Council of Europe. His wife, Leila (an Azeri) was the daughter of a KGB officer and was unaware of her husband&#x27;s defection. She and their children were on holiday in the Azerbaijan SSR at the time of his escape. She was interrogated and detained for some six years, the Soviets presuming (wrongly) that she had been complicit in Gordievsky&#x27;s activities. However, the marriage was effectively dead by then and eventually it foundered completely. It was reported in 2013 that Gordievsky was in a long-term relationship with a British woman he had met in the 1990s.

Gordievsky&#x27;s exfiltration greatly embarrassed both the KGB and the Soviet Union and resulted in disruptions by Viktor Babunov, the KGB&#x27;s chief of counterintelligence, within the KGB including Sergei Ivanov&#x27;s career with the KGB, who was KGB resident in Finland, as well as numerous members of the Leningrad KGB, which was responsible for surveillance of British subjects, and numerous persons close to Vladimir Putin, who was a member of the Leningrad KGB.

Gordievsky included a discussion of his exfiltration in his memoir, &quot;Next Stop Execution&quot;, published in 1995.

==Life in the UK==

Gordievsky has written a number of books on the subject of the KGB and is a frequently quoted media pundit on the subject.

In 1990, he was consultant editor of the journal &quot;Intelligence and National Security&quot;, and he worked on television in the UK in the 1990s, including the game show &quot;Wanted&quot;. In 1995, the former British Labour Party leader Michael Foot received an out-of-court settlement (said to be &quot;substantial&quot;) from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; after the newspaper alleged, in articles derived from claims in the original manuscript of Gordievsky&#x27;s book &quot;Next Stop Execution&quot; (1995), that Foot was a KGB &quot;agent of influence&quot; with the codename &#x27;Boot&#x27;.

On 26 February 2005, he was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Buckingham in recognition of his outstanding service to the security and the safety of the United Kingdom.

Gordievsky was appointed Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for &quot;services to the security of the United Kingdom&quot; in the 2007 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours (in the Diplomatic List). &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper noted that it was &quot;the same gong given (to) his fictional Cold War colleague James Bond&quot;.

Gordievsky said that the KGB were puzzled by and denied the claim that Director General of MI5 Roger Hollis was a Soviet agent. In the 2009 ITV programme &quot;Inside MI5: The Real Spooks&quot;, he recounted how he saw the head of the British section of the KGB express surprise at the allegations that he read in a British newspaper about Roger Hollis being a KGB agent: &quot;Why is it they are speaking about Roger Hollis, such nonsense, can&#x27;t understand it, it must be some special British trick directed against us&quot;. The allegiance of Hollis remains a debated historical issue; the MI5 official website has cited Gordievsky&#x27;s revelation as a vindication of Hollis.

In the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2010, Charles Moore gave a &quot;full account&quot;, which he said had been provided to him by Gordievsky shortly after Foot&#x27;s death, of the extent of Foot&#x27;s alleged KGB involvement. Moore also wrote that, although the claims are difficult to corroborate without MI6 and KGB files, Gordievsky&#x27;s past record in revealing KGB contacts in Britain had been shown to be reliable.

Gordievsky was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy&quot;.

Work in recent years included being a consultant editor for the journal &quot;National Security&quot;, co-hosting a TV show titled &quot;Wanted in the Nineties&quot; and writing content for &quot;Literary Review&quot;.

Gordievsky lived for years in a &quot;safe house&quot; in London, and security has been tightened since the Salisbury poisonings. A September 2018 article indicated that by that time he was living in an undisclosed location in the Home Counties of England.

===Suspected poisoning===
In April 2008, the media reported that on 2 November 2007, Gordievsky had been taken by ambulance from his home in Surrey to a local hospital, where he spent 34 hours unconscious. He says that he was poisoned with thallium by &quot;rogue elements in Moscow&quot;. He accused MI6 of forcing Special Branch to drop its early investigations into his allegations; according to him, the investigation was only reopened due to the intervention of former MI5 Director General Eliza Manningham-Buller.

In Gordievsky&#x27;s opinion, the culprit was a UK-based Russian business associate who had supplied him with pills, which he said were the sedative Xanax, purportedly for insomnia; he refused to identify the associate, saying British authorities had advised against it. Gordievsky accused MI6 of trying to suppress the incident from being known. &quot;I realised they wanted to hush up the crime,&quot; he remarked. &quot;There has been accusation and counter-accusation. If they are saying I am not affected by the poison, why did I spend two weeks in hospital?&quot;

==In popular media==
In 2018 Ben Macintyre published a biography of Gordievsky, &quot;The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War&quot;. The 2019 edition of the book includes an Afterword of post-publication reactions from officers of MI6, the KGB, and the CIA who had been involved in the events surrounding Gordievsky.

In March 2020, Gordievsky&#x27;s story was recounted in an episode of &quot;Spy Wars With Damian Lewis&quot;, on the Smithsonian Channel in the US, streaming on various cable services. The episode, &quot;The Man Who Saved The World&quot;, recounts the &quot;years-long effort by Gordievsky to pass Soviet intelligence to the British, all but preventing a nuclear Armageddon between the Soviet Union and the West&quot;.

In 2023, the third episode of Netflix docuseries &quot;Spy Ops&quot; named &quot;Operation Pimlico&quot; shows the story of Gordievsky&#x27;s extraction from Moscow orchestrated by MI6, shortly after he suspects his cover may have been blown.

In May 2024 the BBC aired a four-part spy documentary series called &quot;Secrets &amp; Spies: A Nuclear Game&quot;, which examined Gordievsky&#x27;s vital work for British Intelligence, stopping Operation Able Tracer, helping NATO build peaceful relationships with Mikhail Gorbachev, and Gordievsky&#x27;s dramatic escape from the Russian/Finland border.

<doc id="325456" wikidata="Q204429" url="?curid=325456" title="Harry Kewell">
<text>Harry Kewell (born 22 September 1978) is an Australian soccer coach, manager and former player. He was most recently the manager of Yokohama F. Marinos in the J1 League.

As a player, Kewell represented Leeds United, Liverpool, Galatasaray, Melbourne Victory, Al-Gharafa and Melbourne Heart. While at Leeds he was named the PFA Young Player of the Year in 2000. Internationally, he received 58 caps, and scored 17 goals while playing for Australia. A left winger also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder or second striker, he is often regarded within the media as &quot;Australia&#x27;s finest soccer export&quot;, despite his career being blighted with injury. In 2012, Kewell was named Australia&#x27;s greatest soccer player in a vote by Australian fans, players and media.

Kewell scored a goal against Croatia which took Australia through to the knockout stages of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Australian national team&#x27;s second World Cup. He is a member of the Executive Committee of the Australian Professional Footballers&#x27; Association. Kewell also has a British passport through his father&#x27;s heritage. Former Middlesbrough midfielder-turned pundit Robbie Mustoe named Kewell as one of the greatest players he had played against but questioned his consistency and attitude after his initial injuries. Former German international Michael Ballack has also highlighted Kewell&#x27;s ability and inconsistency.

Kewell has represented Australia at the 1995 FIFA U-17 World Championship, the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, where Australia finished runners-up, the 2004 OFC Nations Cup, which Australia claimed for the fourth time, the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, where Australia finished runners-up.

To date, Kewell is the only Australian male to have ever played in the UEFA Champions League final, being part of Liverpool&#x27;s squad that won the 2005 UEFA Champions League final. 

==Early life==
Harry Kewell was born on 22 September 1978 in Sydney, New South Wales, to an English father, Rod, and an Australian mother, Helen. Harry grew up supporting Liverpool in English football&#x27;s First Division. Kewell received his early schooling at Smithfield Public School and secondary schooling at St. Johns Park High School before transferring to Westfield Sports High School. Before becoming a teenager he played junior football for Smithfield Hotspurs (now Fairfield Hotspurs) before switching to Marconi Fairfield as a teenager.

==Club career==
===Early career (1993)===
At age 14, Kewell travelled to Thailand, Italy and England with the successful Marconi under-14 team that had recently won the state titles. The team played games against the junior team of Milan, as well as apprenticeship sides in England. This was the first time Kewell had been out of the country but provided him his first taste of football in Europe, having also attended a Premier League match for the first time as a spectator. At age 15, Kewell was offered the opportunity to travel back to England and trial with Premiership football club Leeds United for a period of four weeks as part of the Big Brother Movement in Australia. Kewell travelled to England with his future Socceroo teammate Brett Emerton. Both were successful during their trials at Leeds, however only Kewell was able to take up the club&#x27;s offer due to his father&#x27;s English heritage, which satisfied the visa requirements.

===Leeds United (1993–2003)===

Kewell played for three seasons in the Leeds United youth team. His first match for the youth team was against Sunderland in 1995, and he scored his first hat-trick against Rotherham on 7 December 1996. Kewell was handed his first team debut at age 17 in a 1–0 home defeat against Middlesbrough on 30 March 1996. In 1997, Kewell was part of the Leeds United youth-team that claimed the 1996–97 FA Youth Cup final in a 3–1 aggregate win against Crystal Palace. The first goal he scored for Leeds came some time later, in October 1997, in a 3–1 League Cup victory over Stoke City. Around that time, he was flatmates with Leeds goalkeeper Nicky Byrne, who would later become a member of boyband Westlife.

Kewell was sent off in the Leeds United-Galatasaray 1999–2000 UEFA Cup semi-final match. Playing mostly in a left midfield role and in attack, Kewell became one of Leeds&#x27; young stars in a troop of highly promising youngsters, eventually playing alongside fellow Australian Mark Viduka.

In the 1999–2000 season, on the back of his most successful season at Leeds where he also won PFA Young Player of the Year was selected in the PFA Team of the Year, Italian giants Internazionale had bid £25 million for Kewell, but Leeds rejected the offer, citing his value to their side. The high point of this period was when Kewell helped Leeds to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League in 2000–01. The club, however, began to suffer financial difficulties and, by 2002–03, having sold many of their best players, Kewell&#x27;s efforts in front of goal merely delayed Leeds&#x27; slide from being relegated from the Premiership. Kewell&#x27;s efforts at Leeds United gained him international recognition for his talents. He scored 45 goals in over 180 appearances for Leeds over eight years.

Kewell left Leeds under acrimonious circumstances. In an interview given to the BBC shortly before his move to Liverpool, Kewell strongly criticised the staff at the club, stating that the medical staff loved Lucas Radebe and that his teammates had ostracised him.

===Liverpool (2003–2008)===
Having rejected more financially enticing offers from Milan, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Barcelona, Kewell moved to the club he supported as a boy, Liverpool, for the start of the 2003–04 season. Kewell was handed the famous number seven shirt, surrendered by Vladimír Šmicer.

Kewell&#x27;s transfer was controversial because it was alleged by former England captain Gary Lineker in an article in July 2003 that a significant portion (£2 million of the £5 million) went to Kewell&#x27;s unregistered agent Bernie Mandic to ensure that he ended up at Anfield. In a related matter, Kewell sued Lineker in 2005 for defamation of character, but, with the jury unable to agree on a verdict, the parties had to settle out of court.

Kewell made his debut for Liverpool in the opening game of the 2003–04 Premier League season, a 2–1 home loss to Chelsea on 17 August 2003. Kewell scored his first ever goal for Liverpool in a 3–0 away win over great rivals Everton in the Merseyside derby with a great first time strike. Kewell completed his first ever season at Anfield equal second with Emile Heskey by scoring seven goals, nine behind Michael Owen as Liverpool&#x27;s top goalscorer for the 2003–04 Premier League season. Kewell also finished as Liverpool&#x27;s top scorer in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup, scoring goals against Olimpija Ljubljana, Steaua București and Levski Sofia which ended Kewell&#x27;s season total of ten goals. Kewell kicked off his 2004–05 season poorly, failing to score in his first 14 matches, due to injury problems. He did finally score his first goal in round 15 of the Premier League in a 1–1 away draw against Aston Villa, and that was his only Premier League goal of the season, making this one of his worst seasons ever. Kewell started and played in the 2005 League Cup final and the 2005 Champions League final.

On 25 May 2005, Kewell became the second Australian-born player (Craig Johnston was born in South Africa) to win a major UEFA competition, when he became the only Australian to win the UEFA Champions League, playing in Liverpool&#x27;s win over Milan in the 2005 Champions League final on penalties (Craig Johnston won the predecessor tournament to the Champions League, the European Cup). Kewell was controversially selected by manager Rafael Benítez ahead of the defensive midfielder Dietmar Hamann, signalling the club&#x27;s intent to attack from the outset. The gamble proved unsuccessful, and an injured Kewell was substituted early in the first half with a torn abductor muscle. Liverpool were losing 1–0 at the time and Kewell was booed off the pitch by Liverpool fans with many suggesting he had faked the injury. It also emerged during the summer of 2005 that Kewell had been playing throughout the season with an undiagnosed sports hernia, also known as Gilmore&#x27;s groin. His record as the only Australian to win a major UEFA tournament stood until 18 May 2022, when Ajdin Hrustic became the second Australian to win a UEFA competition courtesy of Eintracht Frankfurt&#x27;s victory over Rangers F.C. in the 2022 UEFA Europa League final.

In November 2005, after recovering from the injury sustained during the final, Kewell spoke to the official Liverpool website, saying that he had a strong desire to repay his manager Rafael Benítez for showing confidence in him by fielding him in the Champions League final. He also thanked his wife and friends for the support shown to him while he recovered from injury. He also re-stated the severity of the injury which had forced him off in the final and told his doubters that they were misguided to question the severity of his injury.

Kewell&#x27;s form for Liverpool in the 2005–06 FA Premier League season showed what he was truly capable of, scoring goals and plenty of assists, lending support to his assertion that his prior mediocre performance was the result of poor health rather than apathy. Kewell scored his first league goal at Anfield in over two years when Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 in January, he was also the only scorer when Liverpool beat Manchester City 1–0 at Anfield and scored the last goal in a 3–1 win over derby rivals Everton just under a month later. Kewell was also one of Liverpool&#x27;s best performers in the FA Cup semi-final win over Chelsea which Liverpool won 2–1.

Kewell played in the 2006 FA Cup final, only to be substituted in the 48th minute due to abdominal pains (the supporters reaction this time was more sympathetic compared to the previous year&#x27;s Champions League final). It was later confirmed by Liverpool that he had torn a groin muscle, but was expected to be fit for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

On 30 April 2007, Kewell made his comeback after almost a year out of club football. He came on as a 55th-minute substitute for Liverpool Reserves in a &quot;mini-derby&quot; against Everton Reserves. On 5 May 2007, he came on as a substitute in the second half of Liverpool&#x27;s match against Fulham at Craven Cottage, having not played for Liverpool since his substitution in the 2006 FA Cup final. On 13 May 2007, Kewell came on as a substitute in the second half against Charlton Athletic in the last match of the Premier League season, where he scored his last ever goal for the club. Speculation on whether he was to be selected in Liverpool&#x27;s upcoming Champions League final in Athens rapidly became positive for Kewell after providing an excellent game against Charlton. Kewell provided a cross in for Dirk Kuyt to assist towards a Xabi Alonso goal and then scored a penalty on the 90th minute. He played in the Champions League final in Athens, appearing as a second-half substitute for Boudewijn Zenden, however Liverpool lost the final 2–1 to Milan.

Kewell was injured for the start of the 2007–08 season, and he faced an uncertain future at Liverpool having suffered yet another injury, which sidelined him for the first month of the Premier League season. Kewell returned as a substitute in Liverpool&#x27;s League Cup victory over Cardiff City on 31 October, coming on in the 71st minute. He then came on as a substitute in the Premier League and Champions League against Blackburn and Beşiktaş respectively. Kewell put in a great performance by setting up two goals for Fernando Torres and Dirk Kuyt as Liverpool beat Marseille in impressive fashion 4–0 away victory to secure qualification to the knockout phase of the Champions League. After his return, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez stated on the club&#x27;s website and to other members of the media that a new contract for Kewell to continue his career at Anfield was not out of the question. Many believed that if Kewell could stay injury free until the season&#x27;s end he would be offered the chance to remain with the club.

Kewell found himself unable to make the team after Liverpool&#x27;s FA Cup defeat to Barnsley. His chances of a new contract were hindered, however; when seeking games and match fitness, he travelled with his national team to play in a game against Singapore. Kewell returned to England with a groin strain, unfortunately leaving less time to prove himself worthy of a new deal. His first goal of the 2007–08 season was for the Liverpool reserve team in their 2–0 win over rivals Manchester United. Because of injuries, his future at Liverpool was uncertain. In May 2008, it was revealed Liverpool would not be offering Kewell a new contract at the club.

===Galatasaray (2008–2011)===
On 5 July 2008, reigning Turkish Süper Lig champions Galatasaray signed Kewell to a two-year contract, presenting him with the number 19 shirt.

Upon signing, Kewell said, &quot;I wanted to move on and this is the best way. I can&#x27;t wait to get started, it&#x27;s just what I&#x27;m looking forward to, a new challenge.&quot; His transfer to Galatasaray provoked strong criticism from fans and teammates of his former club Leeds United as he was a Leeds player when two of their fans were murdered in attacks before a UEFA Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in Istanbul in April 2000. Kewell responded and in an open letter he stated, &quot;I chose the No 19 shirt when I signed for Galatasaray SK as a sign of respect for Leeds because that was the number I got when I first became a regular member of the Leeds United starting XI. I felt that it might be a way to demonstrate that I had not forgotten where it all started and I was hoping that in a small way it would help the healing process of the tragedy that occurred on 5 April 2000. To blame the Galatasaray club for the tragedy in Istanbul is simply wrong and discriminatory.&quot;

Kewell made his debut for Galatasaray in the Turkish Super Cup where he came on as a substitute on the 66th minute, scoring his first goal for Galatasaray just 20 seconds later with his first touch in the 2–1 win over Kayserispor, while also providing the assist for the second goal. His second goal for the club came in the first league match of the season against Denizlispor, which Galatasaray won 4–1. On 23 October 2008, Kewell scored the only goal in Galatasaray&#x27;s UEFA Cup win over Olympiacos. One week later, Kewell played in Galatasaray&#x27;s first Turkish Cup match where they drew 1–1 with Ankaraspor.

On 2 November 2008, Kewell scored his fourth league goal in Galatasaray&#x27;s home win over Gaziantepspor, after a week full of overwhelming speculations in the Turkish media about his injury. Following medical consultations in Australia, it was announced on 12 December 2008 that Kewell would need surgery to repair an inguinal hernia, and the operation took place on 15 December 2008. Of the nine matches that Kewell had scored in before his injury, Galatasaray had won them all, including two UEFA Cup matches, six Süper Lig matches and a Turkish Super Cup match.

In a UEFA Cup round of 32 match against Bordeaux, Kewell scored a goal from 35 metres from goal, bringing the score to 2–1. Galatasaray ended up winning the match and proceeding to the round of 16. On 12 March 2009, during the UEFA Cup round of 16 match against Hamburger SV, Kewell had to play as a centre-back for 40 minutes after the sending off of teammate Emre Aşık, but managed to fulfill the role adequately despite playing out of position. In the second leg of the round of 16 clash, he was again played as a centre-back, scoring a penalty while doing so.
In the 2009–10 season, Kewell scored 14 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. He netted 9 times in 17 league appearances, playing as the main striker in most matches due to an injured Milan Baroš. In a 2009–10 Turkish Cup play-off, Kewell scored in a 2–1 win against Bucaspor on 28 October 2009 to put the side into the group stage phase of the tournament. Finishing on top of their group, Galatasaray were eliminated at the quarter-final stage against Antalyaspor. During the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds, Kewell scored Galatasaray&#x27;s second goal in a 4–1 away win against Israeli club Maccabi Netanya on 30 July 2009. Kewell would then score in a 5–0 win against Estonia&#x27;s Levadia Tallinn on 20 August 2009. Galatsaray qualified for the group stage phase. On 22 October 2009, Kewell scored in a 4–1 win over Dinamo București in Istanbul. In the return leg on 5 November 2009, he scored after 22 minutes in an eventual 3–0 Galatasaray victory. Galatasaray faced Atlético Madrid in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League knockout phase where they lost 3–2 on aggregate to the eventual champions.

On 15 August 2009, Kewell scored two penalties in a 4–1 home win to Denizlispor. Almost two weeks later, on 31 August, he scored a goal after 74 minutes in a 2–0 away win to Ankaraspor on matchday 4 of the Süper Lig season. Kewell scored his fourth goal of the campaign in a 4–3 win to Trabzonspor on 18 October. Two weeks later, he scored in a 2–0 win to Sivasspor at home on 1 November. By matchday 13, Kewell scored his sixth goal of the domestic season in a 1–1 draw to Manisaspor on 22 November. Two weeks later, on 6 December, he scored after 56 minutes in a 1–1 draw to İstanbul BŞB. Just five days later, in an away game against Antalyaspor, the game was locked at 2–2 until after 67 minutes Kewell broke the deadlock to win the match for Galatasaray 3–2 on 11 December. On 19 December, Kewell would score his ninth and final goal for Galatasaray in the 2009–10 season in a 1–0 win to Gençlerbirliği, where he netted on the 77-minute. In January, fellow &quot;Socceroo&quot; teammate and captain Lucas Neill would join Kewell at Galatasaray after he was transferred from Everton. Under coach Frank Rijkaard, Galatasaray finished third on the 2010–11 Süper Lig table, thereby qualifying for the 2010–11 Europa League third qualifying round, where Kewell&#x27;s contract with Galatasaray expired after the 2009–10 season.

On 16 July 2010, it was revealed that Kewell had rejected an approach from A-League side Gold Coast United in favour of staying in Europe. Galatasaray offered a new one-year contract, but it is believed that Kewell preferred a longer-term contract. On 19 July 2010, Galatasaray announced via its official website that the parties had agreed to a one-year extension of Kewell&#x27;s contract. On 21 July, the details of Kewell&#x27;s contract were revealed: he would receive a lump sum fee of €1.8 million and a salary of €30,000 per match. It was also revealed that Kewell would wear number 99 for the 2010–11 season. Kewell scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in a 1–0 win against Gaziantepspor on 14 September 2010. Kewell scored his second goal of the season against Beşiktaş in a 2–1 loss on 29 November; having been down 2–0, Kewell scored for Galatasary after 90 minutes. Kewell opened the scoring after 27 minutes as Galatasary beat Kasımpaşa 3–0 on 5 December 2010.

On 7 February 2011, Kewell scored Galatasaray&#x27;s third goal in a 4–2 win against Eskişehirspor, he was substituted off the field after 63 minutes for Milan Baroš, who would then score Galatasaray&#x27;s fourth goal. Following a solid but not sensational season at Galatasaray, there had been continual speculation that Kewell could be heading back home to Australia, with the Newcastle Jets reportedly a keen investor. The interest in the &quot;Socceroo&quot; coincided with Nathan Tinkler buying out the Novocastrian club in late 2010. Kewell scored his last goal for Galatasaray in a 3–2 away win against Gençlerbirliği on 15 May 2011. On 19 May 2011, Kewell&#x27;s wife, Sheree Murphy, posted on Twitter that Harry would play his last game for Galatasary against Konyaspor because no contract had been offered to him. Galatasaray finished in eighth spot on the Süper Lig table with 46 points, as Kewell scored 5 goals in 20 appearances for the 2010–11 season.

Kewell was a fan favourite among Galatasaray supporters; his working discipline and dignified personality were appreciated by his teammates and board members in Galatasaray as well. He was described as fully professional with a charming character, always smiling and dedicated to his family. His nicknames at Galatasaray were &quot;Büyücü Harry&quot;, meaning &quot;Harry the Wizard&quot; (inspired by &quot;Harry Potter&quot;) and the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Oz Büyücüsü&quot;).

===Melbourne Victory (2011–2012)===

On 20 August 2011, it was announced Kewell had signed a three-year contract with A-League club Melbourne Victory. Melbourne was hyped up with &quot;Kewell Fever&quot; with many hundreds of fans welcoming him at Melbourne Airport and over two thousand fans attending AAMI Park, where he was given his number 22 jersey by chairman Anthony Di Pietro. Kewell played his first friendly against Adelaide United on 23 August at Hindmarsh Stadium, coming off at half-time. Coach Mehmet Durakovic rated his performance as &quot;phenomenal&quot; and went on to say, &quot;Harry&#x27;s really a professional footballer, and should be ready for 8 October.&quot;

Kewell made his first appearance in the 2011–12 A-League season in a 0–0 draw against Sydney FC on 8 October in front of an attendance of 40,000 at Etihad Stadium. Kewell scored his first goal for the Victory from a penalty against Gold Coast United on 26 November 2011 at AAMI Park, Melbourne, after teammate Archie Thompson was brought down in the box in the first minute. On 31 December 2011, at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, Kewell scored his second goal in the fourth minute from a cracking shot outside of the box. After a slow start to his debut A-League season, he started to get his talented form back, resulting in a few best on ground performances. His fourth goal came from a free-kick just outside the box against Gold Coast United in Launceston, Tasmania, on 1 February 2012. His goal, however, was not enough to seal the match, as Melbourne conceded a late goal in the last minute from Gold Coast&#x27;s Michael Thwaite to end in a 1–1 draw.

Kewell scored his fifth goal against Central Coast Mariners on 10 February from a cracking volley in the box which helped Melbourne get a crucial 2–1 win over the top side. It allowed Melbourne Victory a hope of making the finals with six matches remaining. On 18 February, Kewell scored two goals at Suncorp Stadium to give Melbourne a hope of drawing against Brisbane Roar in a classic 3–2 loss. He was taken off in the 77-minute which resulted in Melbourne Victory having a few less chances of scoring. He has scored three goals from two matches at Suncorp Stadium. Kewell did not continue with the club after his first season and returned to Europe to be closer to his mother-in-law as she battled cancer.

===Al-Gharafa (2013)===
On 6 April 2013, Kewell signed to Al-Gharafa in the Qatar Stars League for the remainder of the 2012–13 season as an injury replacement for fellow Australian Mark Bresciano. Kewell made his debut on 7 April as a substitute against Al Sadd. Kewell finished his third and final game of the season in Qatar with his only goal, against Qatar SC on 18 April. With the current terms of his contractual commitments to Al-Garafa completed, Kewell was seen back in Melbourne around 48 hours later, with his future career uncertain.

===Melbourne Heart (2013–2014)===
In June 2013, it was announced that Kewell would play for Melbourne Heart in the 2013–14 A-League season. Following the first match of the season against Melbourne Victory, Kewell was diagnosed with whiplash, ruling him out for three weeks. In training for his matchday 5 return, Kewell suffered an ankle injury. On 26 March 2014, it was announced that Kewell would retire from professional football at the end of the A-League season. His last match was on 12 April 2014 against Western Sydney Wanderers.

On 19 October 2016, it was announced that Kewell had been chosen as the recipient of the Alex Tobin Medal, Australia&#x27;s most prestigious football honour, for his achievements during the course of his career.

==International career==
Kewell became the third youngest player to debut for the Australia national team when he played against Chile on 24 April 1996, aged 17 years and 7 months.

===1998 World Cup===
====Qualification====
In November 1997, Kewell was selected to play for Australia in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Iran. At the Azadi Stadium in Tehran, in front of an estimated crowd of 100,000, Kewell scored his first ever goal for his country and gave Australia a 1–0 lead. Iran eventually drew level and the game resulted in a 1–1 draw, which set up a tense return game in Melbourne.

A then-record crowd for a football match in Australia of 85,513 – at the Melbourne Cricket Ground – witnessed the second leg of the World Cup qualifier against Iran, as well as Kewell&#x27;s second goal. &quot;The Socceroos&quot; eventually stretched their lead to two goals but Iran fought back and scored two vital away goals to finish the game 2–2 and qualify for the 1998 World Cup in France on away goals.

===1997 Confederations Cup===
A few months after failing to qualify for the World Cup, Kewell joined Australia as it competed in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup. After advancing past the groups stage Australia faced Uruguay in the semi-final. Kewell scored the decisive goal two minutes into extra time with a golden goal, immediately giving Australia a 1–0 victory. Australia then faced Brazil in the final, losing 6–0.

===2002 World Cup===
====Qualification====
Kewell joined Australia as they faced Uruguay in both legs of the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC–CONMEBOL play-off). In the first leg that was played in Melbourne, Australia led Uruguay 1–0. However, Uruguay pulled away with a 3–0 win in Montevideo. This meant Kewell and Australia spent another World Cup on the sidelines.

===2003===
In February 2003, Australia made headlines by upsetting England. Kewell scored Australia&#x27;s second goal of the match that ended 3–1. Later that year Kewell once again added to his goal scoring record against Jamaica in a 2–1 win.

===2004 OFC Nations Cup===
Kewell featured in the final of the 2004 OFC Nations Cup. He featured in the second leg of the final against Solomon Islands, scoring in the 8th minute of the first half. Australia would go on to win the leg 5–0, with an overall record of 11-1 after both legs.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
====Qualification====
On 16 November 2005, Australia qualified for the 2006 World Cup after they defeated Uruguay. It was the first time Australia had qualified for the World Cup since 1974 when it was held in West Germany. Kewell was considered instrumental in &quot;the Socceroos&quot;&#x27; defeat of Uruguay, turning the course of the match after he came on as a substitute. After just over half an hour in the first half, a flicked pass on the left wing from Mark Viduka opened up a chance for Kewell, who then scuffed the kick. However the ball fell perfectly for Mark Bresciano who went on to score the equalizer. Kewell also scored the first penalty for Australia in the deciding penalty shoot-out, which they went on to win 4–2.

====Finals====
Kewell played in Australia&#x27;s opening game of the 2006 World Cup against Japan in Kaiserslautern. He did not start for Australia in their second group match against Brazil, but again came on as a substitute, missing an early opportunity when Brazilian goalkeeper Dida punched the ball out dangerously. Kewell was reported to FIFA by referee Markus Merk for verbal abuse after the match but he escaped being sanctioned.

Kewell scored Australia&#x27;s second goal in the 79th minute against Croatia to equal the score at 2–2 and qualify for the round of 16 for the first time. Australia only needed a draw to qualify for the round of 16. He was also awarded Man of the Match for his performance, which made him the second Australian to win the Man of the Match award at a World Cup after Tim Cahill who had won the award earlier in the tournament for his performance against Japan. Due to suspected gout, (later diagnosed as septic arthritis – a bacterial infection in the joints of his left foot) Kewell was unable to play against Italy in the knockout stage, which saw Australia eliminated from the tournament after a 1-0 loss.

===2007 AFC Asian Cup===
Kewell did not play for the national team for a year following the World Cup, and made his national-team comeback in a friendly against Singapore on 30 June 2007. The match was Australia&#x27;s last before the 2007 Asian Cup and Kewell came on as a substitute in the 65th minute, scoring his eighth international goal and providing a cross for the final goal in a 3–0 victory. Kewell was a key part of the Australian squad for their first Asian Cup. Kewell scored his ninth international goal for Australia in a 4–0 win over Thailand in the Asian Cup. After the group stage, in the quarter-final against Japan, Kewell was sent on to the pitch to replace Mark Viduka in the 61st minute, in a 1–1 draw. A penalty shootout was required to break the deadlock and Kewell&#x27;s first penalty shot for Australia was stopped. Australia ultimately lost the shootout and were eliminated from the competition.

===2010 FIFA World Cup===
====Qualification====
Kewell did not play either of Australia&#x27;s first two matches against Qatar and China. Kewell was made captain for Australia&#x27;s qualifier against Iraq at Suncorp Stadium on 1 June 2008. He scored the only goal with a header in the 47th minute as Australia won 1–0. Kewell also scored the third goal against Qatar in Australia&#x27;s 3–1 win to put them into the final qualification round. In a World Cup qualifier warm-up match against the Netherlands, he scored a penalty won by Joshua Kennedy. Australia went on to win 2–1 with Kewell playing a vital part for the national team in the first half. Australia then played Uzbekistan, winning 2–0 with Kewell scoring a penalty.

====Finals====
Kewell did not play in Australia&#x27;s opening game of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, a 4–0 loss to Germany. After the loss, Kewell said that the morale of the team remained high, ahead of a clash against Ghana. During the match against Ghana on 19 June, Kewell was sent off for blocking a goal by handling the ball. Standing on the goal line, Kewell attempted to block the ball from entering the goal net with his chest, however the ball ricocheted off his arm; he received a straight red card for the offence on the 24-minute. Asamoah Gyan went on to score the resulting penalty and the game was drawn 1–1, severely damaging Australia&#x27;s hopes of progressing past the group stage. This was the 150th red card issued in a World Cup match. Kewell denied rumours that he was behind a supposed rift in &quot;the Socceroos&quot; camp. After the match, Kewell said that he was devastated by the decision made by referee Roberto Rosetti and felt that the red card &quot;killed&quot; his World Cup dream.

===2011 AFC Asian Cup===
Kewell started in all of &quot;the Socceroos&quot;&#x27; matches in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, scoring three times for the &quot;green and gold&quot; in the Qatar-based tournament. His first goal came in Australia&#x27;s first match, against India, with a left-footed shot from outside the penalty area. Kewell&#x27;s second goal came in Australia&#x27;s quarter-final match against Iraq with a header in the 118th minute in extra-time, which gave Australia a 1–0 win and put them into the semi-finals of the Asian Cup for the first time in Australia&#x27;s history. Kewell continued his fine form in the semi-final against Uzbekistan by opening the scoring in the first five minutes, helping his side to a 6–0 win and progress to the final, where they were beaten 1–0 by Japan.

===2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers===
In February 2012, Kewell scored his last goal for Australia in a 4–2 win over Saudi Arabia in Melbourne. On 8 June 2012, Kewell played his final game for Australia in a scoreless draw against Oman.

On 23 May 2017, Kewell was appointed head coach of League Two club Crawley Town, becoming the first Australian to coach a professional English side. Warren Feeney was appointed assistant manager to Kewell. Kewell&#x27;s managerial debut on 5 August was a 3–1 home loss to Port Vale. Kewell guided Crawley Town to a 14th place finish in League Two, with his most successful spell consisting of 10 league wins in 14 league games between 9 December 2017 and 17 February 2018. Kewell left Crawley Town after six games into the 2018–19 season to take over at Notts County with Crawley 14th in League Two.

===Notts County===
On 31 August 2018, Kewell was appointed manager of fellow League Two club Notts County, being officially announced three days later, becoming the club&#x27;s fifteenth permanent manager in 10 years, with the club sitting bottom of League Two. On 13 November 2018, he was sacked after 11 league games in charge; he had won three and the team were in 22nd place, just above the relegation zone.

===Oldham Athletic===
On 1 August 2020, Kewell was appointed as manager of Oldham Athletic on a one-year contract with the option to extend for a further year. He became their fifth manager in the last 12 months. He oversaw a poor first full month in charge with the side going six games without a victory in October, later achieving a record of 11 wins, 6 draws and 15 defeats for a 32% win rate.

On 7 March 2021, it was announced by Oldham Athletic that Kewell, and his assistant, Alan Maybury, had been relieved of his duties as manager. Kewell left Oldham with the club in 16th place in League Two, above their position in the previous season.

===Barnet===

On his debut on 21 August, his side lost 5–0 at home to his former club Notts County. He was dismissed on 20 September, having lost five and drawn two of his seven games.

===Celtic===

<text>François-Joseph Gossec (; 17 January 1734 – 16 February 1829) was a French composer of operas, string quartets, symphonies, and choral works.

==Life and work==
The son of a small farmer, Gossec was born at the village of Vergnies, then a French exclave in the Austrian Netherlands, now an &quot;ancienne commune&quot; in the municipality of Froidchapelle, Belgium. Showing an early taste for music, he became a choir-boy in Antwerp. He went to Paris in 1751 and was taken on by the composer Jean-Philippe Rameau. He followed Rameau as the conductor of a private orchestra kept by the &quot;fermier général&quot; Le Riche de La Poupelinière, a wealthy amateur and patron of music. Gradually he became determined to do something to revive the study of instrumental music in France.

Gossec&#x27;s own first symphony was performed in 1754, and as conductor to the Prince de Condé&#x27;s orchestra he produced several operas and other compositions of his own. He imposed his influence on French music with remarkable success. His &quot;Requiem&quot; premiered in 1760, a ninety-minute piece which made him famous overnight. Years later, in 1778, Mozart visited Gossec during a trip to Paris, and described him in a letter to his father as &quot;a very good friend and a very dry man.&quot;

Gossec founded the &quot;Concert des Amateurs&quot; in 1769 and in 1773 he reorganised the &quot;Concert Spirituel&quot; together with Simon Le Duc and Pierre Gaviniès. In this concert series he conducted his own symphonies as well as those by his contemporaries, particularly works by Joseph Haydn, whose music had become increasingly popular in Paris, finally even superseding Gossec&#x27;s symphonic work.

In the 1780s Gossec&#x27;s symphonic output decreased as he began concentrating on operas. He organized the &quot;École de Chant&quot; in 1784, together with Etienne Méhul, was conductor of the band of the &quot;Garde Nationale&quot; of the French Revolution, and was appointed (with Méhul and Luigi Cherubini) inspector of the &quot;Conservatoire de Musique&quot; at its creation in 1795. He was an original member of the &quot;Institut&quot; and a &quot;chevalier&quot; of the Legion of Honour. In 1803, he met Napoleon, who admired Gossec very much and asked him if he wanted to work under him, which Gossec declined. In 1815, after the defeat of his friend Napoleon at Waterloo, the Conservatoire was closed for some time by Louis XVIII, and the eighty-one-year-old Gossec had to retire. Until 1817 he worked on his last compositions, including a third &quot;Te Deum&quot;, and was supported by a pension granted by the Conservatoire.

He died in the Parisian suburb of Passy. The funeral service was attended by former colleagues, including Cherubini, at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His grave is near those of Méhul and Grétry.

Some of his techniques anticipated the innovations of the Romantic era: he scored his &quot;Te Deum&quot; for 1,200 singers and 300 wind instruments, and several oratorios require the physical separation of multiple choirs, including invisible ones behind the stage. He wrote several works in honor of the French Revolution, including &quot;Le Triomphe de la République&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Offrande à la Liberté&quot;. Gossec&#x27;s &quot;Gavotte&quot;, from his opera &quot;Rosine, ou L&#x27;épouse abandonnée&quot; (1786), remains familiar in popular culture because Carl Stalling and Charles M. Jones used arrangements of it in several Warner Brothers cartoons. Arguably the most notable of these is Porky Pig&#x27;s dance to an uncredited version of Gossec&#x27;s Gavotte in Jones’ &quot;Porky&#x27;s Cafe&quot; (1942).

Gossec was little known outside France, and his own numerous compositions, sacred and secular, were overshadowed by those of more famous composers; but he was an inspiration to many, and powerfully stimulated the revival of instrumental music.

<text>Randy Randall Rudy Quaid (born October 1, 1950) is an American actor and comedian known for his roles in both serious drama and light comedy.

He was nominated for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for his role in &quot;The Last Detail&quot; in 1973. In 1978 he co-starred as a prisoner in &quot;Midnight Express&quot;. Quaid also won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy Award for his portrayal of U.S. President Lyndon Johnson in &quot;&quot; (1987).

He also received Emmy nominations for his roles in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1984) and &quot;Elvis&quot; (2005). Quaid is also known for his roles of Cousin Eddie in the &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; movies and Russell Casse in &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996). He voiced Alameda Slim in the animated feature &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004).

==Early life and education==
Quaid was born in Houston, Texas, to Juanita Bonniedale &quot;Nita&quot; (née Jordan; 1927–2019), a real estate agent, and William Rudy Quaid (1923–1987), an electrician. Quaid has English, Scots-Irish, and Cajun ancestry. Through his father, Quaid is a first cousin, twice removed, of cowboy performer Gene Autry. Randy Quaid grew up in Bellaire, Texas, a small city surrounded by Houston, and in southwest Houston. He is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid.

In high school, he took a class in drama on a whim, although he didn&#x27;t expect he would enjoy the lectures. After the third day, however, he was captivated by the course and decided to make acting his professional goal. He continued studying acting at the University of Houston. During one course, his teacher sent him to audition for Peter Bogdanovich, who was casting for &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, and Quaid won the role in what became his debut film.

==Acting career==
===Film===
Randy Quaid has appeared in over 90 films. Peter Bogdanovich discovered him when Quaid was a student at the University of Houston, and he received his first exposure in Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;. His character escorts Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) to a late-night indoor skinny-dip at a swimming pool. Other Bogdanovich films he appeared in are &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; and &quot;Paper Moon&quot;.

Quaid&#x27;s first major critically acclaimed role was in &quot;The Last Detail&quot; (1973). He played Larry Meadows, a young United States Navy sailor on his way to serve a harsh sentence for petty theft. Jack Nicholson starred as a sailor assigned to transport him to prison. Quaid was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

Quaid appeared opposite Charles Bronson in the 1975 action film of a Mexican prison escape &quot;Breakout&quot;, based on actual events. In 1976, he appeared opposite Marlon Brando in &quot;The Missouri Breaks&quot;. In 1978 Quaid had a supporting role in the Alan Parker drama &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, about Americans and an Englishman imprisoned in Turkey.

In 1983, Quaid portrayed Cousin Eddie in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. Quaid appeared in four of the seven films in the National Lampoon&#x27;s &quot;Vacation&quot; film series as the jovial redneck cousin (through marriage) to Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, wife of Chevy Chase&#x27;s Clark Griswold. In 1987, he won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson in &quot;&quot;. Quaid said that he had wanted to play Johnson since becoming an actor. &quot;I responded to him and his wants and needs in a way I&#x27;ve never done with any other character,&quot; he said. Quaid also tried to portray what he learned were Johnson&#x27;s political attitude:
Shortly after appearing in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), the third installment of the series, Quaid was featured in &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990) as NASCAR car owner and successful car salesman Tim Daland, a determined businessman who expects his team to be top-notch for fans and sponsors. He also starred in &quot;Quick Change&quot; with Bill Murray in 1990, and was the lead in the comedies &quot;Martians Go Home&quot; and &quot;Cold Dog Soup&quot;, released the same year. In 1992, he played the monster in &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, opposite Patrick Bergin as Victor Frankenstein. Quaid said &quot;I wanted to make the monster not just a monster, but a disfigured man. I wanted to emphasize the human qualities. He is basically struggling for equal rights. He wants anything any man would want.&quot;

In 1994, Quaid played a newspaper columnist in the comedy-drama &quot;The Paper&quot;, and had a cameo appearance in &quot;Major League II&quot; as Johnny. He later had starring roles in the 1996 film &quot;Kingpin&quot;, where he played the Amish bowler Ishmael, as well as a role as pilot in the blockbuster science fiction film &quot;Independence Day&quot;, released the same year. He appeared in &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; (1997), the fourth installment of the series, and was then given the lead role in a &quot;Vacation&quot; spin-off, a made-for-television film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie&#x27;s Island Adventure&quot; (2003), which marks his final appearance in the franchise to date.

Quaid was the voice of cattle rustler Alameda Slim in Disney&#x27;s animated feature &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004), and had a pivotal supporting role in &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005) as rancher Joe Aguirre. He played the King of Spain in &quot;Goya&#x27;s Ghosts&quot; (2006). Quaid had a co-starring role in the Canadian independent comedy &quot;Real Time&quot; (2008), which opened the 2008 Slamdance Film Festival. His acclaimed performance earned him a Vancouver Film Critics Circle Award.

Following his work in the direct-to-video comedy &quot;Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach&quot; (2009), Quaid&#x27;s legal troubles prevented him from working for almost a decade.
Quaid was not asked to reprise the role of Cousin Eddie in &quot;Vacation&quot; (2015), although the character is verbally referenced. He returned to performing with Rob Margolies&#x27; weight loss comedy &quot;All You Can Eat&quot; (2018), which premiered at the SOHO International Film Festival in June 2018. After the film&#x27;s September 2018 screening at the Northeast Film Festival, Quaid was nominated for their award for &quot;Best Supporting Actor in a Feature Film&quot;.

===Television===
In 1981, Quaid co-starred in the two part television film adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, playing the character of Lenny. Quaid&#x27;s other television appearances include a season as a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL) cast member (1985–1986), the role of gunslinger John Wesley Hardin in the miniseries &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; and starring roles in the short-lived series &quot;The Brotherhood of Poland, New Hampshire&quot; (2003) and &quot;Davis Rules&quot; (1991–1992).

In 2005, he received Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award nominations for his portrayal of Elvis Presley&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, in the critically acclaimed CBS television network miniseries &quot;Elvis&quot; (2005) and starred in &quot;Last Rites&quot;, a made-for-cable Starz/Encore! premiere movie. Quaid voiced the character Colonel Sanders in radio and television commercials for fast-food restaurant chain &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot;. Quaid&#x27;s voice-over work also included Capitol One Credit Card, US Air, Miller Beer and a guest role in &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (as Anthony&#x27;s father in the second-season episode, &quot;A Visit to Anthony&quot;). He narrated the 2006 PBS series &quot;Texas Ranch House&quot;.

===Theater===
In 2004, Quaid appeared on stage undertaking the starring role of Frank in the world premiere of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;The God of Hell&quot;, produced by the New School University at the Actors Studio Drama School in New York. In &quot;The God of Hell&quot;, Quaid&#x27;s portrayal of Frank, a Wisconsin dairy farmer whose home is infiltrated by a dangerous government operative who wants to take over his farm, was well-received and -reviewed by New York City&#x27;s top theatre critics. It marked the second time that Quaid starred in a Shepard play, the first being the long running Broadway hit &quot;True West&quot;.

In February 2008, a five-member hearing committee of Actors&#x27; Equity Association, the labor union representing American stage actors, banned Quaid for life and fined him more than $81,000. The charges that brought the sanctions originated in a Seattle production of &quot;Lone Star Love&quot;, a Western-themed adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, in which Quaid played the lead role of Falstaff. The musical was scheduled to come to Broadway, but producers cancelled it.

Quaid&#x27;s statement on the charges was &quot;I am guilty of only one thing: giving a performance that elicited a response so deeply felt by the actors and producers with little experience of my creative process that they actually think I am Falstaff.&quot;

==Music career==
Quaid has performed musical work, primarily through his band Randy Quaid &amp; The Fugitives. The group released its first single, &quot;Star Whackers&quot;, in March 2011. An accompanying film, &quot;Star Whackers&quot;, was premiered by the Quaids in Vancouver on April 23, 2011.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Quaid was married to Ella Marie Jolly, a former model, on May 11, 1980, and they had a daughter, Amanda Marie, born May 29, 1983. They were separated on September 9, 1986, and divorced on August 24, 1989. He said of their split, &quot;I went through this delayed adolescent thing. I didn&#x27;t want to be tied down to a family.&quot;

Quaid met Evi Motolanez in December 1987 on the set of the film &quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot;, in which Madonna starred. They wed on October 5, 1989, at the San Ysidro Ranch, a Montecito, California, resort. His brother Dennis, his future sister-in-law Meg Ryan, and his six-year-old daughter Amanda were in attendance.

===Legal issues===
In 2006, Quaid, who acted in &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, sued the producers for misrepresenting the film as &quot;a low-budget, art house film with no prospect of making money&quot; in order to secure Quaid&#x27;s professional acting services at below-market rates.

In 2009, Quaid and his wife were arrested for allegedly defrauding an innkeeper in Santa Barbara by using an invalid credit card to pay a $10,000 bill. The two were released on bail that evening and subsequently paid most of the bill. However, they repeatedly failed to appear in court and warrants were issued for their arrest. They eventually appeared in court the following year where the case was dismissed against Quaid for lack of evidence. His wife, Evi, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of fraud and was placed on probation for three years in addition to having to spend 240 hours in community service.

In September 2010, Quaid and his wife were charged with burglary after they spent five days occupying the guest house in a vacant home they once owned in Santa Barbara. The Quaids claimed that the home was wrongfully transferred to a third party by the use of a forged signature. Warrants for their arrest were issued after they failed to appear in court, and as a result, they also forfeited their bail.

In October 2010, Quaid and his wife moved to Vancouver, Canada, where they sought asylum protections under the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, stating that they feared for their lives in the United States. Border authorities arrested the couple for their outstanding warrants in the U.S. After they were granted bail, Quaid gave a press interview, and later, the couple&#x27;s asylum-seeking story was detailed in an article by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Quaid&#x27;s wife Evi was granted Canadian citizenship in 2011, based on her parentage, and Quaid sought permanent resident status as the husband of a Canadian. In January 2013, this request was denied.

Quaid lived in Montreal beginning in 2013 and was briefly arrested for not checking in as a non-resident. In 2014, the Quaids sued the U.S. State Department for revoking their passports in 2011. By 2015, Quaid&#x27;s legal appeals in Canada were exhausted, and he was notified he was to be deported. One week prior to the deportation date, the couple drove across the Canadian border into Vermont, where they were detained by U.S. Customs. The couple were detained pending an extradition procedure ordered by the State of California.

On review of the State of California&#x27;s case, the Vermont judge found irregularities, and voided the extradition request, whereupon the Quaids were released and allowed to remain in Vermont without conditions. With his lawyer at his side, Quaid asserted in a press conference that the reason he was released was that the California judge had issued an arrest warrant before the alleged crime had been committed. Quaid and his wife planned to make Vermont their permanent home, as his wife grew up there. As of 2021, when Quaid considered a run in the California gubernatorial recall election, it was unclear whether the case against the Quaids was still open, according to &quot;TheWrap.&quot;

==Political views==
After 2016, Quaid became an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump, and later became a proponent of the disproven conspiracy theory that Trump&#x27;s defeat in the 2020 United States presidential election was the result of widespread election fraud. Three weeks after the election, Trump, on his Twitter account, retweeted some of Quaid&#x27;s video material claiming election fraud and wrote &quot;Thank you Randy, working hard to clean up the stench of the 2020 Election Hoax!&quot;

<doc id="325477" wikidata="Q493685" url="?curid=325477" title="Centre Party (Norway)">
<text>The Centre Party (, Sp; ), formerly the Farmer&#x27;s Party (, Bp), is an agrarian political party in Norway.

Ideologically, the Centre Party is positioned in the centre on the political spectrum, it advocates for economic nationalist and protectionist policy to protect Norwegian farmers with toll tariffs, and it supports decentralisation. It was founded in 1920 as the Farmers&#x27; Party (, Bp) and from its founding until 2000, the Centre Party joined only governments not led by the Labour Party, although it had previously supported a Labour government in the 1930s. This turned around in 2005, when the party joined the red–green coalition government led by the Labour Party. Governments headed by prime ministers from the party include the short-lived Kolstad and Hundseid&#x27;s Cabinet between 1931 and 1933 and the longer-lasting Borten&#x27;s Cabinet from 1965 until 1971.

The Centre Party has maintained a strong stance against Norwegian membership in the European Union, successfully campaigning against Norwegian membership in both the 1972 and 1994 referendums, during which time the party saw record-high election results. Subsequently, the party proposed Norway&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Economic Area and the Schengen Agreement. In 2017, party deputy leader Ola Borten Moe declared nationalism to be a &quot;positive force&quot;.

== History ==
The party was founded at the national convention of the &quot;Norsk Landmandsforbund&quot; during 17–19 June 1920, when it was decided by the association to run for the 1921 Norwegian parliamentary election. In 1922, the association was renamed to the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the political activity of the group was separated as the Farmers&#x27; Party (&quot;Bondepartiet&quot;).

During the eight decades since the Centre Party was created as a political faction of a Norwegian agrarian organisation, the party has changed a great deal. Only a few years after its creation, the party broke with its mother organisation and started developing a policy based on decentralisation. The 1930s have in the post-war era been seen as a controversial time in the party&#x27;s history. This is partly because Vidkun Quisling, who later became the leader of Nasjonal Samling, was Minister of Defence in the Farmers Party Kolstad and Hundseid cabinets from 1931 to 1933. However, Quisling was not a member of the Farmers Party. While there were fascist sympathies among parts of the Farmers Party&#x27;s electorate, the Farmers Party itself never supported fascism and it was the Farmers&#x27; Party that enabled the first stable Labour cabinet in Norway. In 1935, they reached a compromise with the Labour Party which led to the Nygaardsvold Cabinet. In addition, the Farmers&#x27; Party was represented in the war-time cabinet by Anders Fjelstad, who served as a consultative councillor of state. Political scientist Trond Nordby argues that the Farmers&#x27; Party has been given an undeservably bad reputation from this time and that the party was not really &quot;as dark brown as some claim&quot;.

In 1959, the party briefly changed its name to the Norwegian Democratic Party – Democrats (&quot;Norsk Folkestyreparti – Demokratene&quot;), but it soon had to change the name again due to election technicalities. In June 1959, the name was changed to the current Centre Party. This happened out of the need to attract an additional electorate with the continuing decline of the agrarian share of the population. The party&#x27;s membership numbers peaked at 70,000 in 1971. From 1927 to 1999, the party published the newspaper &quot;Fylket&quot;.

In local elections, the party has enjoyed strong support in several small municipalities, where the party has a strong influence. After the 2007 Norwegian local elections, 83 of the mayors in Norway represented the Centre Party. Only the Labour Party had more mayors and the Centre Party had more mayors than any other, relative to party size.

The Centre Party had been a part of both centrist and centre-right coalition governments from 1963 to 2000 and in six governments, one of which were led by a Prime Minister from the party. Since the 2005 Norwegian parliamentary election, the party ran for government together with the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party as the red–green coalition, with the Centre Party constituting the green part of the alliance. The coalition was successful in winning the majority of the seats in the Storting and negotiations followed with the aim of forming a coalition cabinet led by the Labour Party&#x27;s leader Jens Stoltenberg. These negotiations succeeded and the Centre Party entered the Second Stoltenberg Cabinet on 17 October 2005 with four ministers. The Red–Greens were re-elected to government in the 2009 Norwegian parliamentary election. It has been argued that the party&#x27;s ideology moved more towards social democracy at the end of the 1980s.

The party is known for its support of high toll tariffs on foreign cheese and meat called &quot;toll protection&quot; as well as their proposal to shoot all wolves in Norway. However, this has lately been rejected as the party&#x27;s policy by Sandra Borch, the predator policies spokesperson of the Centre Party, who in a 2020 interview given on the debate program to Dagsnytt 18 on NRK1 stated that &quot;[t]he Centre Party has never proposed to exterminate the wolf. We want substainable management of predators&quot;, adding that &quot;[w]hat the Centre Party has been a part of, together with the Liberal Party in a broad agreement in the Storting, is that we will have 4-6 breeding wolf packs in Norway.&quot;

The party was also in charge of implementing the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats in 1986. The Centre Party&#x27;s Rakel Surlien was Minister of the Environment when Norway ratified the Berne Convention, so that protection of wolves became Norwegian law. The Berne Convention was otherwise adopted by a unanimous Storting, which also included all MPs from the Centre Party.

In late 2012, the Centre Party caused controversy in Norway when it emerged that the party had demanded higher import tariffs on meat and hard cheeses to protect Norwegian farmers from foreign competition. This included increased duties of 429% on lamb, 344% on beef and 277% on all but 14 exempted hard cheeses.

Since the leadership of Trygve Slagsvold Vedum during years in opposition, the party has been described as populist by several sources.

<text>Whistling, without the use of an artificial whistle, is achieved by creating a small opening with one&#x27;s lips, usually after applying moisture (licking one&#x27;s lips or placing water upon them) and then blowing or sucking air through the space. The air is moderated by the lips, curled tongue, teeth or fingers (placed over the mouth or in various areas between pursed lips) to create turbulence, and the curled tongue acts as a resonant chamber to enhance the resulting sound by acting as a type of Helmholtz resonator. By moving the various parts of the lips, fingers, tongue, and epiglottis, one can then manipulate the types of whistles produced.

==Techniques==


Pucker whistling is the most common form in much Western music. Typically, the tongue tip is lowered, often placed behind the lower teeth, and the pitch altered by varying the position of the tongue. Although varying the degree of pucker will change the pitch of a pucker whistle, expert pucker whistlers will generally only make small variations to the degree of pucker, due to its tendency to affect purity of tone. Pucker whistling can be done by either only blowing out or blowing in and out alternately. In the &#x27;only blow out&#x27; method, a consistent tone is achieved, but a negligible pause has to be taken to breathe in. In the alternating method, there is no problem of breathlessness or interruption as breath is taken when one whistles breathing in, but a disadvantage is that many times, the consistency of tone is not maintained, and it fluctuates.

Many expert musical palatal whistlers will substantially alter the position of the tongue to ensure a good quality tone. Venetian gondoliers are famous for moving the tongue while they whistle in a way that can look like singing. A good example of a palatal whistler is Luke Janssen, winner of the 2009 World Whistling Competition.

Finger whistling is harder to control but achieves a piercing volume. In Boito&#x27;s opera &quot;Mefistofele&quot; the title character uses it to express his defiance of the Almighty.

Whistling can also be produced by blowing air through enclosed, cupped hands or through an external instrument, such as a whistle or even a blade of grass or leaf.

== Competitions ==
One of the most well-known whistling competitions is the International Whistlers Convention (IWC). This annual event took place in Louisburg, North Carolina, from 1973 to 2013. It recognized adult males and female, teenage males and female, and child champions.

One of the most prolific whistling competitors is a Virginia-based communications expert, Christopher W. Ullman, who has won the IWC so many times he is listed in the International Whistling Hall of Fame. Ullman won the IWC Grand Championship three times, in 1996, 1999, and 2000. In 1999, he was given the Lillian Williams Achievement Award as Whistling Entertainer of the Year.

According to Guinness World Records, the highest pitch human whistle ever recorded was measured at 10,599 Hz, which corresponds to an E9 musical note. This was done by Joshua Lockard in Southlake, Texas, on May 1, 2019. The lowest pitch whistle ever recorded was measured at 174.6 Hz, which corresponds to an F3 musical note. This was accomplished by Jennifer Davies (Canada) at the Impossibility Challenger Games in Dachau, Germany, on 6 November 2006. The most people whistling simultaneously was 853, which was organized at the Spring Harvest event at Minehead, UK, on April 11, 2014.

==As communication==
On La Gomera, one of Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands, a traditional whistled language, &quot;Silbo Gomero&quot;, is still used. At least nine separate whistling sounds are used to produce usually four vowels and five consonants, allowing this language to convey unlimited words. The language allowed people (such as shepherds) to communicate over long distances on the island, when other communication means were not available. It is now taught in school so that it is not lost among the younger generation. Another group of whistlers were the Mazateco Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico. Their whistling aided in conveying messages over far distances but was used also in close quarters as a unique form of communication with a variety of tones.

Whistling can be used to control trained animals such as dogs. A shepherd&#x27;s whistle is often used instead.

Whistling has long been used as a specialized communication between laborers. For example, whistling in theatre, particularly on-stage, is used by flymen (members of a fly crew) to cue the lowering or raising of a batten pipe or flat. This method of communication became popular before the invention of electronic means of communication, and is still in use, primarily in older &quot;hemp&quot; houses during the set and strike of a show.
Burrowing animals species are known to whistle to communicate threats, such as marmot species including the groundhog (woodchuck) and the alpine marmot. Whistling to communicate threats is used by animals such as prairie dogs, which have one of the most complex communication systems in the animal kingdom. Prairie dogs can communicate an animal&#x27;s speed, shape, size, and species and for humans specific attire and if the human is carrying a gun. This method of communication is usually done by having a stand on two feet surveying for potential threats while the rest of the pack finds food. Once a threat has been identified the sentry sounds a whistle alarm, (sometimes describing the threat) at which point the pack retreats to their burrows. The intensity of the threat is usually determined by how long the sentry whistles. The sentry continues to whistle the alarm until the entirety of the pack has gone to safety at which point the sentry returns to the burrow.

==In music==
The range of pucker whistlers varies from about one to three octaves. Agnes Woodward classifies by analogy to voice types: soprano (c&quot;-c&quot;&quot;), mezzo (a-g&#x27;&quot;) and alto (e or d-g&quot;).

Many performers on the music hall and Vaudeville circuits were professional whistlers (also known as siffleurs), the most famous of whom were Ronnie Ronalde and Fred Lowery, in German speaking area Ilse Werner The term &quot;puccalo&quot; or &quot;puccolo&quot; was coined by Ron McCroby to refer to highly skilled jazz whistling.

Whistling is featured in several television themes, such as &quot;Lassie&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and Mark Snow&#x27;s title theme for &quot;The X-Files&quot;.
It also prominently features in the score of the movie &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot;, composed by Bernard Herrmann, which was later used in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.

Roger Whittaker released albums with whistling tracks such as &quot;Mexican Whistler&quot; and &quot;Finnish Whistler&quot;.

==By spectators==
Whistling is often used by spectators at sporting events to express either enthusiasm or disapprobation. In the United States and Canada, whistling is used much like applause, to express approval or appreciation for the efforts of a team or a player, such as a starting pitcher in baseball who is taken out of the game after having pitched well. In much of the rest of the world, especially Europe and South America, whistling is used to express displeasure with the action or disagreement with an official&#x27;s decision, like booing. This whistling is often loud and cacophonous, using finger whistling. Whistling is used by spectators attending concerts to show approval of the singer’s talent.

==During roll calls in Ravensbrück==
Some female prisoners of concentration camp Ravensbrück, such as the Dutch Martha Froukje Mees, lifted their fellow prisoners during the long daily roll calls by whistling songs and melodies.

==Cultural beliefs==
In many cultures, whistling or making whistling noises in the morning is thought to attract good luck, good things, or good spirits.

In the UK there has historically been a superstitious belief in the &quot;Seven Whistlers&quot; which are seven mysterious birds or spirits who call out to foretell death or a great calamity. In the 19th century, large groups of coal miners were known to have refused to enter the mines for one day after hearing this spectral whistling. The Seven Whistlers have been mentioned in literature such as &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; by Edmund Spenser, as bearing an omen of death. William Wordsworth included fear of the Seven Whistlers in his poem, &quot;Though Narrow Be That Old Man&#x27;s Cares&quot;. The superstition has been reported in the Midlands of England but also in Lancashire, Essex, Kent, and even in other places such as North Wales and Portugal. The Iron Maiden song &quot;The Prophecy&quot; from their album also references the &quot;Seven Whistlers&quot; as a warning of doom. 

In Russian and other Slavic cultures, and also in Romania and Lithuania, whistling indoors is superstitiously believed to bring poverty (&quot;whistling money away&quot;), whereas whistling outdoors is considered normal. In Estonia and Latvia, it is widely believed that whistling indoors may bring bad luck and therefore set the house on fire.

Whistling on board a sailing ship is thought to encourage the wind strength to increase. This is regularly alluded to in the Aubrey–Maturin books by Patrick O&#x27;Brian.

Theater practice has plenty of superstitions: one of them is against whistling. A popular explanation is that traditionally sailors, skilled in rigging and accustomed to the boatswain&#x27;s pipe, were often used as stage technicians, working with the complicated rope systems associated with flying. An errant whistle might cause a cue to come early or a &quot;sailor&#x27;s ghost&quot; to drop a set piece on top of an actor. An offstage whistle audible to the audience in the middle of a performance might also be considered bad luck.

Transcendental whistling (&quot;chángxiào&quot; 長嘯) was an ancient Chinese Daoist technique of resounding breath yoga, and skillful whistlers supposedly could summon supernatural beings, wild animals, and weather phenomena.

In Thailand, it is believed that whistling is inauspicious at night, especially when indoors, because it is an invitation for a ghost or a snake to enter the house. In India, it is also believed that whistling in the home will cause the members of the household to experience various disasters. Countries in East Asia such as China, Japan, and Korea also believe in similar superstitions. In Islamic countries such as Indonesia, whistling at night is believed to summon the jinn.

<text>Citizen Smith is a British television sitcom written by John Sullivan, first broadcast from 1977 to 1980.

It starred Robert Lindsay as Walter Henry &quot;Wolfie&quot; Smith, a young Marxist &quot;urban guerrilla&quot; in Tooting, south London, who is attempting to emulate his hero Che Guevara. Wolfie is a reference to the Irish revolutionary Wolfe Tone, who used the pseudonym &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; in order to evade capture by the Dublin Castle administration. Wolfie is the self-proclaimed leader of the revolutionary Tooting Popular Front (the TPF, merely a small bunch of his friends), the goals of which are &quot;Power to the People&quot; and &quot;Freedom for Tooting&quot;.

Wolfie dresses in a stereotypical fashion for rebellious students of the period: logoed T-shirt, denim jeans, Afghan coat, and black beret. He supports Fulham and occasionally wears a Fulham scarf. He rides a scooter and lives in the attic room at his girlfriend&#x27;s parents’ house, and constantly clashes with her over-protective father.

==History==
John Sullivan became a scenery shifter at the BBC in 1974 because of his desire to write a sitcom outline he had called &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;; fearing rejection if he sent the idea in, he decided it would be better to get a job, any job, at the BBC, learn more about the business and then meet someone who would actually take notice of his as yet unwritten script. After he approached producer Dennis Main Wilson, the first &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; script was written. Main Wilson loved the script, and saw the potential for a series; it was put into production almost immediately as a pilot for &quot;Comedy Special&quot; — a showcase for new talent, which had succeeded &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; — under the title &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;. The pilot was a success, and four series and a Christmas special were produced between 1977 and 1980.

It has been claimed that the &quot;Tooting Popular Front&quot; — fictionally based near to writer John Sullivan&#x27;s childhood home of Balham — was partly inspired by a real-life fellow-South London far-left group, the Brixton-based Workers&#x27; Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought. The group&#x27;s activities were reported in &quot;The Times&quot;″ diary of April 1977, the same month the pilot episode of &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; was broadcast.

==Opening titles==
The opening titles of each episode of the first two series always began with Wolfie emerging from Tooting Broadway Underground station, followed by a shot of him kicking a can across a bridge until he is in close up, accompanied by a background rendition of the socialist anthem &quot;The Red Flag&quot;. They always ended with him shouting &quot;Power to the People&quot;, resulting in awkward consequences such as waking a sleeping baby or causing a vehicle to crash. From the third series, the shots of Wolfie on the bridge were replaced with on-screen clips of other cast members and their names, rather than just the list of names that had been used previously, and the reactions to Wolfie&#x27;s shout were dropped entirely. Series 4 had a new title sequence, which began with Tucker&#x27;s van driving past Tooting Broadway tube station with &quot;The Revolution is Back&quot; painted on it. The rest of the credits were backed by clips from the last episode of series three, &quot;The Glorious Day&quot;, and Wolfie&#x27;s shout is heard, but he is not seen.

==Plot==
===Series 1===
From episode three, &quot;Abide with Me&quot;, Wolfie Smith (Robert Lindsay) lives, with his religious, teetotal friend Ken Mills (Mike Grady), in a flat in the house of his girlfriend&#x27;s family — Shirley Johnson (Cheryl Hall, at the time Lindsay&#x27;s wife); her affable but naïve mother, Florence, who mistakenly calls Wolfie &quot;Foxy&quot;; and her strict, right-wing father, Charlie, who disapproves of Smith&#x27;s lifestyle and refers to him as a &quot;flaming yeti&quot; or &quot;Chairman Mao&quot;. Shirley considers herself engaged to Wolfie, on account of a fake crocodile tooth necklace he gave her after she was asked when they would get engaged.

Other regular characters in the series are the other &quot;urban guerrillas&quot;: Tucker (married to the ever-pregnant but never-seen June); Speed, the TPF&#x27;s Warlord, and his girlfriend Desiree; and local gangster publican Harry Fenning (played by Stephen Greif), who refers to Wolfie as &quot;Trotsky&quot;. Wolfie and the TPF frequent Harry&#x27;s pub, The Vigilante, and are at times menaced by Harry&#x27;s hired muscle Floyd and Cyril (played by Dana Michie and Barry Hayes), who are referred to by Florence as &quot;Mr Fenning&#x27;s foster children&quot;.

The closest Wolfie comes to legitimate political office is contesting the Tooting North constituency as the TPF candidate at a parliamentary by-election, whose election night declaration is televised; however, he gains only six votes, losing to the Conservative candidate David West. He and the gang attempt to kidnap the new MP from a victory celebration, only to mistakenly capture Harry Fenning (who was leaving the Conservative Club during the occasion) instead (Episode 6 - &quot;The Hostage&quot;).

===Series 2===
Series two consists of six episodes; however, owing to industrial action at the BBC on 22 December 1978, one episode (&quot;Spanish Fly&quot;) had to be rescheduled as a special in August 1979.

===Series 3===

&quot;The Glorious Day&quot;, which Wolfie had always been plotting, comes at the end of the third series, in an episode of the same name, in which the Tooting Popular Front &quot;liberate&quot; a Scorpion tank and use it to invade the Houses of Parliament, only to find the place empty, owing to a parliamentary recess. During the TPF&#x27;s &quot;annual manoeuvres&quot; on Salisbury Plain, Wolfie, Ken, Tucker and Speed decide to camp down after an evening of heavy drinking; unbeknownst to them, they are in the middle of a military live firing area. During the night, the Army hold an exercise, and the Scorpion is &quot;abandoned&quot; by its crew after being declared &quot;knocked out&quot; by a &quot;landmine&quot; during a training exercise. When Wolfie and his comrades discover this, Wolfie comes up with his revolutionary plan. Speed states that he learned to drive a Scorpion during his time in the Territorial Army, at which point the group steal it and drive it back to London.

On returning, they hide it in Charlie Johnson&#x27;s garage. Charlie comes home from work and opens the garage door to park his car. Curious as to the purpose of the Scorpion parked amongst the garden tools, he climbs down inside and accidentally steps on the machine-gun fire button. The result is that their neat garden is raked with heavy machine-gun fire, narrowly missing his wife Florence who is hanging out the washing, and annihilating their garden gnomes. This episode also includes a new song from John Sullivan and sung by Robert Lindsay — &quot;We are the TPF. We are the People.&quot;

Series three consists of seven episodes.

===Series 4===
The series began with Wolfie and company being paroled, a brief flirtation at being pop stars on the back of their &quot;fame&quot; ended in disaster. While the TPF have been away, a new gangster, Ronnie Lynch, has usurped Fenning&#x27;s position in Tooting, including his old pub. Wolfie hates him more than he did Fenning, and after various run-ins with Lynch (who constantly refers to Wolfie as &quot;Wally&quot;), the series was concluded in the penultimate episode, with Wolfie fleeing Tooting to escape a £6,000 contract put on his head by Ronnie Lynch after Lynch had caught Wolfie in his wife Mandy&#x27;s bedroom. Closing with a shot mirroring the opening credits, Wolfie is seen entering Tooting Broadway tube station. Series four consisted of seven episodes and a Christmas special, &quot;Buon Natale&quot;, in which Wolfie and Ken ride to Rimini on Wolfie&#x27;s Lambretta to visit Shirley for the festive period, only to find that she has become romantically involved with an Italian named Paolo. This episode was shown after the series officially ended, but is set before the events of the last episode.

==Notes==

*Some sources erroneously name the pilot as &quot;A Roof Over My Head&quot;, which was actually the title of the previous week&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Special&quot;, written by Barry Took (which also led to a series).
*In the penultimate episode, Wolfie&#x27;s full name was revealed as Walter Henry Smith – W H Smith.
*Early episodes state that there are six members of the Tooting Popular Front, but only four appear onscreen. In series 3 Wolfie says that two founder members have left the TPF: Dave the Nose (the TPF&#x27;s Foreign Secretary) has emigrated, and Reg X (a Black Panther) is playing second oil drum in a steel band at Butlins.
*In the 1980 Christmas special, the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales stood in for Rimini, with other locations in the vicinity used for other parts of their journey across Europe.
*The 1980 Christmas special featured the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, which has been replaced on subsequent DVD releases, owing to licensing issues.
*In the original television broadcast of the episode, &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; the music that accompanies Wolfie&#x27;s commute on his first day at work is &quot;Carry That Weight&quot; from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album. This too was substituted on the DVD issue, with a nondescript jazz tune.
*The end title theme was written by John Sullivan and sung by Robert Lindsay, and is called &quot;The Glorious Day&quot;.

==Episodes==

The first episode aired on 12 April 1977. This episode was a pilot. Over the next three years, a further four series and a Christmas special were aired, totalling thirty episodes. The last episode aired on 31 December 1980. There is a mythical episode called &quot;Right to Work&quot; which appears in some episode guides; the confusion may arise from the episode &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;, which opens with Wolfie involved in a &quot;right to work&quot; protest.

The entire series was repeated on BBC1 in 1992–1993. The series has also been re-run on satellite channels UKGold/UKTV Drama and on Gold, though one episode has never been repeated – &quot;A Story For Christmas&quot; from 1977. All the episodes have been released on DVD.

==Novel==
&quot;Citizen Smith&quot;, a novelisation of the first series written by Christopher Kenworthy, was published by Universal books, London in 1978.

==Mooted revival==
In 2015, Lindsay was reported as saying he was very keen to reprise the role of Wolfie Smith, particularly with the rise of Jeremy Corbyn. However, it was also reported that the family of the by then deceased Sullivan, who own the rights, did not want to bring it back.

==Home media==
Playback released two DVD volumes of &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;, each with two series. Series one and two (including the pilot) were released in 2003 followed by series three and four later that year.

Only two episodes have actually been cut: &quot;Changes&quot; – where Tucker and Wolfie miming to the Beatles tracks &quot;Till There Was You&quot; (and Tucker&#x27;s line &quot;I think they like us.&quot;) and &quot;Help!&quot; have been cut from the scene where Tucker serenades June; and &quot;Prisoners&quot; – where a short scene of Wolfie singing along to the Beatles track &quot;She Loves You&quot;, which comes in between the shot of Speed throwing stones at Wolfie&#x27;s window and the shot of the window breaking, has also been cut.

Cinema Club bought the rights to the series, and later released all four series in a complete series set on 17 July 2017.

<doc id="325487" wikidata="Q240460" url="?curid=325487" title="Jennifer O'Neill">
<text>Jennifer O&#x27;Neill (born February 20, 1948) is a Brazilian-born American author, model and former actress. Born in Brazil, and moving to the United States as an infant, she first came to prominence as a teenage model, as well as for her spokesperson work for CoverGirl cosmetics, which began in 1963 and spanned three decades. She made her feature film debut in the comedy film &quot;For Love of Ivy&quot; (1968), followed by a lead role in Howard Hawks&#x27;s Western film &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; (1970).

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s breakthrough role came in Robert Mulligan&#x27;s period drama &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot; (1971), in which she portrayed the wife of an army serviceman during World War II, who becomes the subject of a teenage boy&#x27;s romantic attraction. The same year, she starred in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Such Good Friends&quot;. In the mid-1970s, O&#x27;Neill appeared in several Italian films, including Luchino Visconti&#x27;s final feature, &quot;The Innocent&quot; (1976), and Lucio Fulci&#x27;s giallo horror film &quot;The Psychic&quot; (1977). She later starred in David Cronenberg&#x27;s cult horror film &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981), and in the short-lived television series &quot;Cover Up&quot; (1984–1985).

In 1988, O&#x27;Neill became a born-again Christian and, inspired by her feelings of regret over having an abortion at age 22, became active in the anti-abortion movement. She has since authored several books, including a memoir, &quot;Surviving Myself&quot; (1999), in which she detailed her career, marriages, experiences with anxiety and postpartum depression, and her religious faith. O&#x27;Neill founded the Hope &amp; Healing at Hillenglade foundation in Nashville, Tennessee, an equine therapy foundation that specializes in treating war veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Since the 1990s, O&#x27;Neill has occasionally appeared in film and television, including roles in the independent film &quot;Doonby&quot; (2013) and the Rachel Scott biopic &quot;I&#x27;m Not Ashamed&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neill was born on February 20, 1948, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Irene Freda (née Pope), a native of London, and Oscar Delgado O&#x27;Neill, a Brazilian of Portuguese, Spanish and Irish ancestry. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s father, born in Puerto Rico, was a bomber pilot in World War II, and later owned a medical supply company. Her paternal great-grandfather, Oscar O&#x27;Neill Sr., was the president of the Bank of Rio de Janeiro. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s mother, one of seven children, was raised in a &quot;poor but close-knit family.&quot;

When she was an infant, she relocated with her family to the United States, where she and her older brother Michael were raised in New Rochelle, New York, and Wilton, Connecticut. O&#x27;Neill began riding horses at age 9 and became an accomplished equestrienne, winning upwards of 200 ribbons at horse show competitions in her teens.

At age 14, after her parents informed her the family was relocating to New York City, O&#x27;Neill attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills, and fell into a coma for approximately two weeks. Reflecting on this, she said: &quot;I didn’t want to die, I just wanted to be heard. It was just a rebellion against my parents’ decisions. What seems like a bump in the road as we get older, to a teenager can seem catastrophic...  [our moving meant] losing my ability to take care of a horse that I was able to ride. They wouldn&#x27;t let me take our dog and took her to the pound.&quot; In a later interview, O&#x27;Neill said she lacked adequate role models as a child, and described her parents as &quot;completely involved with themselves.&quot;

==Career==
===1963–1971: Modeling and breakthrough===
After her family&#x27;s relocation to New York City, two of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s neighbors suggested that she model: &quot;That appealed to me, because then I could buy my own horse and no one could take anything away from me again. So I strolled into Eileen Ford’s agency, and she signed me on the spot.&quot; By age 15, while attending the prestigious Dalton School in Manhattan, she began appearing on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and &quot;Seventeen&quot;, earning $80,000 ($ today)
in 1962. Commenting on O&#x27;Neill in 1965, Diana Vreeland said: &quot;O&#x27;Neill is a dream. She has great distinction.&quot;

O&#x27;Neill largely used her modeling income to fund her equestrian endeavors, which afforded her to purchase her own horse, named Alezon. However, when O&#x27;Neill was 15 years old, the horse balked before a wall at a horse show, throwing her, causing her to fracture her neck and lower spine in three places. The injury resulted in her suffering lifelong back pain. O&#x27;Neill eventually dropped out of the Dalton School at age 17 to wed her first husband, IBM executive Deed Rossiter.

In 1963, O&#x27;Neill signed a contract with CoverGirl cosmetics, marking the beginning of a thirty-year career as a spokesperson for the company. O&#x27;Neill is listed in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History&#x27;s Center for Advertising History for her long-standing contract with CoverGirl cosmetics as its model and spokesperson in ads and television commercials.

In 1968, O&#x27;Neill landed a small role in the comedy film &quot;For Love of Ivy&quot;. In 1970, she played her first lead role in the Howard Hawks film &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; co-starring John Wayne. She had a supporting role in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Such Good Friends&quot; (1971) starring Dyan Cannon and Ken Howard.

In the 1971 film &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot;, O&#x27;Neill played Dorothy Walker, the early-20s wife of an airman who has gone off to fight in World War II. She stated in a 2002 interview that her agent had to fight to even get a reading for the part, since the role had been cast for an &quot;older woman&quot; to a &quot;coming of age&quot; 15-year-old boy, and the director was only considering actresses over the age of thirty. The film was a box-office success and went on to attract a cult following.

===1972–1979: Italian films===

In 1972, she co-starred with Tom Jones in David Winters&#x27;s television special &quot;The Special London Bridge Special&quot;. The same year, she starred in the crime thriller &quot;The Carey Treatment&quot; (1972), and the drama &quot;Glass Houses&quot;, the latter of which was filmed in 1970. This was followed by a lead role in &quot;Lady Ice&quot; (1973) opposite Donald Sutherland and Robert Duvall.

O&#x27;Neill next had a leading role in the psychological horror film &quot;The Reincarnation of Peter Proud&quot; (1975), co-starring with Michael Sarrazin and Margot Kidder, and directed by J. Lee Thompson. The same year, she appeared opposite Elliott Gould in the Ted Post-directed comedy &quot;Whiffs&quot;.
By the mid-1970s, O&#x27;Neill had forged a career in Italy, first starring in Luigi Zampa&#x27;s drama &quot;The Flower in His Mouth&quot; (1975) opposite James Mason, which was shot on location in Sicily. The following year, she starred in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s final directorial feature, &quot;The Innocent&quot;, and subsequently starred in Lucio Fulci&#x27;s &quot;The Psychic&quot; (1977), portraying a clairvoyant whose visions lead to the discovery of a murder.
She was originally cast in the Disney film &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (1979), but was told she needed to cut her hair because it would be easier to film the zero-G scenes. She gave in, drinking wine during the haircut and leaving noticeably impaired. She lost the part after a serious car crash on the way home. O&#x27;Neill was instead cast in the action martial arts film &quot;A Force of One&quot; (1979), co-starring with Chuck Norris.

===1980–1990: Subsequent film and television===
O&#x27;Neill starred opposite David Carradine in the aviation-themed drama &quot;Cloud Dancer&quot; (1980), followed by a lead role in David Cronenberg&#x27;s science fiction horror film &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981), portraying a woman who leads an oppositional group against a malevolent private military company creating biokinetic and psychokinetic humans.

When her movie career slowed, O&#x27;Neill took roles in series television. She starred in NBC&#x27;s short-lived 1982 prime time soap opera &quot;Bare Essence&quot; and played the lead female role on the 1984 television series &quot;Cover Up&quot;. On October 12, 1984, Jon-Erik Hexum, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s co-star in the &quot;Cover Up&quot; television series, mortally wounded himself on the show&#x27;s set, unaware that a gun loaded with a blank cartridge could still cause extreme damage from the effect of expanding powder gases. He died six days later.

O&#x27;Neill continued to appear in film and television throughout the late 1980s, including in the drama film &quot;I Love N.Y.&quot; (1987) and in the Perry Mason television film &quot;Perry Mason: The Case of the Shooting Star&quot; (1986).

===1991–present: Later work===
In 1991, O&#x27;Neill starred in the thriller film &quot;Committed&quot;, portraying a nurse who discovers the fellow staff at the psychiatric hospital she has been hired at are in fact inmates. She later starred opposite James Brolin in &quot;The Visual Bible: Acts&quot; (1994), which depicts the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neill has been married nine times to eight men (remarrying her sixth husband), and had three children, one each with three of her husbands. After the birth of her first child, Aimee, O&#x27;Neill experienced undiagnosed postpartum depression and committed herself to a psychiatric hospital for treatment, which included electroshock therapy.

She was briefly married to Emmy-award-winning television producer and choreographer Nick De Noia from 1975 to 1976. De Noia, who also served as O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s manager at the time of their marriage, was a closeted homosexual. In 1987, de Noia was murdered by one of his former associates. O&#x27;Neill told journalists that she was &quot;very upset&quot; by the news of his death.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s fifth husband, John Lederer, sexually abused her first daughter, Aimee. O&#x27;Neill initially disbelieved the accusation after Lederer passed several lie detector tests, and the abuse allegation strained her relationship with her daughter. Reflecting on the abuse in 2019, O&#x27;Neill said: &quot;My daughter and I are very close today, but we were in court for a year and I didn’t know who to believe. He passed lie detector tests, so it tore my relationship with her apart. He remarried and did the same thing to his next teenage stepchild. He was just a masterful liar. When I understood how much she needed me to recognize that she was telling the truth, and she recognized that I didn’t have a clue. She was integral in helping bring him to justice. She was so brave, she put a wire on and got him to admit what he’d done.&quot;

On October 23, 1982, O&#x27;Neill suffered a gunshot wound in her home on McClain Street in Bedford, New York. Police officers who interviewed O&#x27;Neill determined that she had accidentally shot herself in the abdomen with a .38 caliber revolver at her 30-acre, 25-room French-style estate while trying to determine if the weapon was loaded. Her husband at the time, John Lederer, was not in the house when the handgun was discharged, but two other people were in the house. Detective Sgt. Thomas Rothwell was quoted as having said that O&#x27;Neill &quot;didn&#x27;t know much about guns.&quot; Reflecting on the incident, O&#x27;Neill said: 

In 1988, O&#x27;Neill became a born-again Christian. Commenting on her faith, she said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to preach to anybody; I only want to say what happened to me.&#x27; In her 1999 autobiography &quot;Surviving Myself&quot;, O&#x27;Neill describes many of her life experiences, including her marriages, career, and her move to her Tennessee farm in the late 1990s. She has said that she wrote the autobiography (her first book) &quot;... at the prompting of her children.&quot;

O&#x27;Neill has dual citizenship, being a Brazilian and U.S. citizen.

==Activism==
In 2004, O&#x27;Neill wrote and published &quot;From Fallen to Forgiven&quot;, a book of biographical notes and thoughts about life and existence. O&#x27;Neill recounted how she underwent an abortion at age 22 in 1970 while dating a Wall Street socialite after the divorce from her first husband. Her regrets over the experience contributed to her becoming a Pro-Life activist and a born-again Christian in 1986 at age 38. She also began counseling abstinence to teens. Concerning her abortion, she writes:

O&#x27;Neill continues to be active as a writer working on her second autobiography, &quot;CoverStory&quot;, an inspirational speaker, and fundraiser for the benefit of crisis pregnancy centers across the United States. She has also served as the spokesperson for the Silent No More Awareness Campaign, an organization for people who regret that they or their partners had abortions.

She also founded Hope &amp; Healing at Hillenglade, an equine therapy foundation in Nashville, Tennessee that serves war veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

<doc id="325489" wikidata="Q315372" url="?curid=325489" title="Gabriel Tarde">
<text>Jean-Gabriel (de) Tarde (; ; 12 March 1843 – 13 May 1904) was a French sociologist, criminologist and social psychologist who conceived sociology as based on small psychological interactions among individuals (much as if it were chemistry), the fundamental forces being imitation and innovation.

==Life==
Tarde was born and raised in Sarlat in the province of Dordogne. He studied law at Toulouse and Paris. From 1869 to 1894 he worked as a magistrate and investigating judge in the province. In the 1880s he corresponded with representatives of the newly formed criminal anthropology, most notably the Italians Enrico Ferri and Cesare Lombroso and the French psychiatrist Alexandre Lacassagne. With the latter, Tarde came to be the leading representative for a &quot;French school&quot; in criminology. In 1900 he was appointed professor in modern philosophy at the Collège de France. As such he was the most prominent contemporary critic of Durkheim&#x27;s sociology.

== Work ==
Among the concepts that Tarde initiated were the group mind (taken up and developed by Gustave Le Bon, and sometimes advanced to explain so-called herd behaviour or crowd psychology), and economic psychology, where he anticipated a number of modern developments. Tarde was very critical of Émile Durkheim&#x27;s work at the level of both methodology and theory such as during the Tarde-Durkheim debate in 1903. However, Tarde&#x27;s insights were ridiculed as &quot;metaphysics&quot; and hastily dismissed by Durkheim and his followers who went on to largely establish the &quot;science&quot; of sociology, and it was not until U.S. scholars, such as the Chicago school, took up his theories that they became famous.

===Criminology===
Tarde took an interest in criminology and the psychological basis of criminal behavior while working as a magistrate in public service. He was critical of the concept of the atavistic criminal as developed by Cesare Lombroso. Tarde&#x27;s criminological studies served as the underpinning of his later sociology.

Tarde also emphasized the tendency of the criminal to return to the scene of the crime and to repeat it, which he saw as part of a wider process of repetition compulsion.

===Imitation===
Tarde considered imitation, conscious and unconscious, as a fundamental interpersonal trait, with the imitation of fathers by sons as the primal situation, resting on prestige.

Tarde highlighted the importance of the creative exemplar in society, arguing that &quot;genius is the capacity to engender one&#x27;s own progeny&quot;.

== Science fiction ==
Tarde also wrote a science-fiction novel entitled &quot;Underground Man&quot; (&quot;Fragment d&#x27;histoire future&quot;, 1896). The plot is a post-apocalyptic story of an Earth destroyed by a new Ice Age. Humanity must rebuild a new civilization underground. The choice is made to lay the foundation of their utopia on music and art.

== Influence ==
* Tarde is mentioned as a prominent influence in Scipio Sighele&#x27;s pioneering book &quot;La Folla delinquente&quot; on mass psychology.
* Gustave le Bon&#x27;s book The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind also refers to Tarde as a source.
* Henri Bergson
* Sigmund Freud built on Tarde&#x27;s ideas of imitation and suggestion for his work on the theory of the crowd, published as Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego.
* Everett Rogers furthered Tarde&#x27;s &quot;laws of imitation&quot; in the 1962 book &quot;Diffusion of innovations&quot;.
* From the late 1990s and continuing today, Tarde&#x27;s work has been experiencing a renaissance. Spurred by the re-release of his essay &quot;Monadologie et Sociologie&quot; by Institut Synthelabo under the guidance of Gilles Deleuze&#x27;s student , Tarde&#x27;s work is being re-discovered as a harbinger of postmodern French theory, particularly as influenced by the social philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.
* It has been argued that Tarde should be recognized as a founding figure of political anthropology, in an article authored by Arpad Szakolczai and Bjorn Thomassen in 2011.

For example, in &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot;, Deleuze&#x27;s milestone book which affected his transition to a more socially-aware brand of philosophy and his writing partnership with Guattari, Deleuze in fact re-centered his philosophical orientation around Tarde&#x27;s thesis that repetition serves difference rather than vice versa. Also on the heels of the re-release of Tarde&#x27;s works has come an important development in which French sociologist Bruno Latour has referred to Tarde as a possible predecessor to Actor-Network Theory in part because of Tarde&#x27;s criticisms of Durkheim&#x27;s conceptions of the Social.

A book, &quot;The Social after Gabriel Tarde: Debates and Assessments&quot;, edited by Matei Candea, was published by Routledge in 2010. It provides a set of mature critiques of the recent renaissance of Tarde as well as suggesting models for scholars to use Tarde&#x27;s thought in their scholarship. This book includes contributions that philosophically reflect the Latourian (including a contribution from Latour himself) as well as Deleuzian approaches to Tarde, and also highlight a number of new ways Tarde is being adapted in terms of methods in contemporary sociology, particularly in the area of ethnography, and the study of online communities. Additionally, in 2010, Bruno Latour and Vincent Antonin Lepinay released a short book called &quot;The Science of Passionate Interests: An Introduction to Gabriel Tarde&#x27;s Economic Anthropology&quot;, in which they show how Tarde&#x27;s work offers a strong critique of the foundations of the economics discipline and economic methodology.

Tarde&#x27;s work has further influenced affect philosophy. For example, in 2012 Tony D Sampson&#x27;s book &quot;Virality: Contagion Theory in the Age of Networks&quot; used a Tarde inspired imitation thesis to describe the tendency for emotions, feelings and affects to spread &quot;accidentally&quot; on digital networks.

<text>The SeaBus is a passenger-only ferry service in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It crosses Burrard Inlet to connect the cities of Vancouver (at Waterfront station) and North Vancouver (at Lonsdale Quay). Owned by TransLink and operated by the Coast Mountain Bus Company, the SeaBus forms an important part of the region&#x27;s integrated public transportation system. In , the SeaBus had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== Service ==

The SeaBus fleet currently consists of four vessels, with the most recent ship—the MV &quot;Burrard Chinook&quot;—entering service July 22, 2021. The ferries operate between approximately 6:00am and 1:00am from Monday to Saturday, and between 8:00am and 11:30pm on Sundays and holidays. During the daytime, two ferries are in service, with the two ferries departing simultaneously from opposite termini and passing each other halfway. The crossing takes 10 to 12 minutes in each direction with a cruising speed of , with a 3 to 5 minute turnaround and, therefore, operates on a 15-minute turn-around schedule. At these times, over 50 crossings are made a day. During the evenings (after 9:00pm) and early Saturday mornings (until 7:00am), service is reduced to a 30-minute schedule with only one ferry operating. In 2017, the SeaBus carried over 17,000 riders on average per weekday and transported an estimated 5.84 million people between Vancouver and the North Shore of Burrard Inlet.

The SeaBus is capable of operating on a 12-minute turnaround (down to 10 minutes with simultaneous loading and unloading). However, at the higher speeds, the wake created disturbs other users of the Burrard Inlet. During overloads, it is sometimes operated at the higher speeds.

The ferries operate with four crew members on board (captain and first mate on the bridge and two attendants on the passenger level) and engineers who stay ashore most of the time, but do regular checks of the engines and are available to come aboard at any time. SeaBus crew members are trained and certified to deal with marine emergencies, and will give directions to passengers in the unlikely event of an emergency.

The original emergency procedure involved using the other SeaBus to evacuate passengers from the distressed vessel. Although the viability of this had been demonstrated, Transport Canada became concerned about this approach during times that the other vessel may not be available and has recently mandated the addition of life rafts.

The turnstiles on the entrance into the SeaBus waiting area are used only for counting the number of passengers boarding. If the maximum number is reached, the turnstiles lock and no more passengers are allowed to board the vessel.

=== Fares ===
SeaBus is a &quot;Fare Paid Zone&quot;, similar to SkyTrain and buses, wherein passengers are required to possess a valid fare. Fare inspections are performed by transit security officers and on occasion by members of the Metro Vancouver Transit Police. SeaBus attendants may check fares but do not conduct enforcement. SeaBus attendants can call transit security to deal with non-compliant passengers. Failure to pay the correct fare or retain a valid fare may result in being removed from the terminal or fined $173.

== Terminals ==
The SeaBus stops on the Vancouver side at Waterfront Station, near the Vancouver Convention Centre and the cruise ship terminal at Canada Place. A skywalk connects the SeaBus terminal to the main station building, where passengers can transfer to the West Coast Express and two lines of the SkyTrain system (Expo Line and Canada Line). In 2018, a seismic and accessibility upgrade of the Waterfront terminal began, which included escalator replacements and the construction of a new staircase to improve foot traffic flow.

In North Vancouver, the SeaBus stops at the purpose-built Lonsdale Quay, which features an adjacent bus loop; together they form a major transit hub for Vancouver&#x27;s North Shore municipalities. In addition to serving commuters, Lonsdale Quay has become an important tourist destination, with a hotel and public market. In 1989, the North Vancouver terminal was designated the &quot;Charles A. Spratt SeaBus Terminal&quot;, in honour of Charles Spratt, Project Manager of the SeaBus project from conception to launch, and Marine Manager of the system until his retirement in 1988.

Each terminal consists of two docks surrounded by an E-shaped structure: passengers board from the central waiting hall, which is separated into two waiting areas (each serving one dock) by partitions and turnstiles, and disembark onto a side platform (a Spanish solution).

== Ferries ==
The current SeaBus fleet consists of the following vessels:

The ferries are catamarans constructed out of aluminium, which was quite rare when the initial two crafts were constructed in the 1970s. The ferries are double-ended so that they can travel in either direction without turning around. There are four diesel engines in each vessel, one for each propeller. The propulsion system uses a marine version of the same diesel engine used to power many of the diesel buses on the transit system. The ferries can operate with only three engines if required. The ferries are equipped with radar, allowing them to operate in dense fog.

The third vessel, the &quot;Burrard Pacific Breeze&quot;, began service in December 2009, and TransLink operated all three ferries during the 2010 Winter Olympics. TransLink originally planned to provide regular three-vessel service by 2011 by overhauling and refitting both the &quot;Burrard Otter&quot; and the &quot;Burrard Beaver&quot; following the games to extend their service life for an additional twenty years. However, citing the lack of funding, the agency announced in 2009 it planned to upgrade only one of the original vessels and retire the other one; another new ferry will be commissioned instead if funding becomes available in the future.

TransLink resumed two-vessel service in March 2010, mostly using the &quot;Burrard Beaver&quot; and the &quot;Burrard Pacific Breeze&quot;, with the &quot;Burrard Otter&quot; being used as a substitute. At that point the agency announced its intention to keep all three vessels in the expectation that funding becomes available for three-vessel service in the future.

In late 2012, TransLink announced it had selected Damen Group of the Netherlands to build the fourth SeaBus vessel, the MV &quot;Burrard Chinook&quot;; the project was expected to cost approximately $25million. The new vessel was expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2014, at which point the &quot;Burrard Beaver&quot; would become a spare vessel and the &quot;Burrard Otter&quot; would be retired. Construction on the fourth SeaBus was delayed until November 2017, at which point the project cost had grown to $32.2million. In September 2019, TransLink announced the &quot;Chinook&quot; would not enter service until mid-2020. It ultimately entered service on July 22, 2021.

Before the &quot;Chinook&quot; entered service, there used to be no spare ferries, and all refits and upgrades were done during a long weekend when the half-hour service could be maintained with one vessel. Engine replacements and minor refits can be done during the system downtime overnight. Despite running for over 35 years, the two original ships were rarely taken out of service for maintenance, boasting a service reliability of over 99.9%.

=== Fuel efficiency ===
The Vancouver SeaBus uses 83 kilowatt-hours per vehicle-kilometre, at a speed of 13.5 kilometres per hour. When full (i.e. when seating 400 people), the energy used is 0.21 kilowatt-hours per passenger-kilometre.

=== Livery ===
The colour scheme of SeaBus has changed at least three times since opening in 1977. From launch until 1985, both the &quot;Burrard Otter&quot; and the &quot;Burrard Beaver&quot; were painted a bright orange colour in order to make them highly visible to other ships and tugs using the harbour, since the SeaBus route crosses the path of other traffic. To accommodate Vancouver&#x27;s Expo 86, the city&#x27;s then-transit authority BC Transit changed the design scheme to white with one red and one blue stripe as well as a BC flag label, matching SeaBus with the then newly built SkyTrain system and newly ordered bus fleet. This remained until the 1999/2000 handover of BC Transit to Metro Vancouver&#x27;s present transportation administration, TransLink. The paint scheme has since been white (or grey) with blue and golden yellow strips across the sides of the ferries.

Rather than using the standard livery, the &quot;Burrard Chinook&quot; is wrapped in art illustrating the lifecycle of the Chinook salmon, designed by Indigenous artists from the Musqueam Indian Band, the Squamish Nation, and the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation.

== History ==

The first regular service between the City of North Vancouver and Vancouver began in 1900 with the craft &quot;North Vancouver&quot;. Three years later, the North Vancouver Ferry and Power Company was created, took over the existing service, and built a new craft called &quot;St. George&quot;. These two ferries were later renamed &quot;North Vancouver Ferry No. 1&quot; and &quot;North Vancouver Ferry No. 2&quot;. The City of North Vancouver took over the service in 1908 to provide a more reliable ferry connection with Downtown Vancouver. Soon after, another craft, &quot;North Vancouver Ferry No. 3&quot;, was built. In 1936, the &quot;No. 2&quot; was retired and used as a logging camp on the west coast of Vancouver Island until it was destroyed by fire.

In 1938, the Lions Gate Bridge was completed, which significantly reduced demand for ferry service. However, there was an increase in demand with the onset of World War II because of the shipbuilding boom in North Vancouver. This growth in business spurred the creation of a new ferry, the &quot;North Vancouver Ferry No. 5&quot;, in 1941. The &quot;MV Crosline&quot; was also leased from Washington to meet demand. According to James Barr, 1943 was the busiest year that North Vancouver Ferries had, ferrying over 7 million passengers across the Burrard Inlet.

&quot;North Vancouver No. 5&quot; was built in Coal Harbour by Boeing Shipyards in 1941. It ran faithfully with its Union Diesel until 1958 when it was tied up at the foot of Lonsdale Ave along with &quot;North Vancouver Ferry No. 4&quot;. Jesse Oliver Kinnie, a North Vancouver Ferry employee, looked into the possibility of purchasing &quot;North Vancouver Ferry No. 4&quot; and running it on the same route as it had run all its life. It had a higher height clearance on the car deck than &quot;Ferry No. 5&quot; and was faster. The numbers did not add up and the plan was abandoned. &quot;Ferry No. 4&quot; also ran on a Union Diesel.

The ferries were in major decline by the 1950s. In 1948, the &quot;No. 3&quot; was taken off of regular service and was sold in 1953. The cost of operating the ferries was high, and the last sailing by the &quot;No. 4&quot; ferry took place on August 30, 1958. The &quot;No. 4&quot; was later sold to be used in Prince Rupert. Later, &quot;No. 4&quot; returned to Vancouver and was tied up on the Vancouver side of Burrard Inlet. It was in desperate need of a refit and had to be kept afloat with pumps to keep the water out of its hull. When the power failed and the pumps stopped it went to the bottom of the inlet. The &quot;No. 5&quot; was converted into the Seven Seas Restaurant at the foot of Lonsdale in North Vancouver. It remained there until 2002 when the City of North Vancouver and the federal courts had it demolished after a long-standing dispute over who would be responsible if it sank and concern that the hull was in danger of imminent collapse. In dry dock it proved to be quite sound, but at that point the decision had already been made to scrap it.

There were plans in the 1960s to build a tunnel under Burrard Inlet which would have connected to the proposed freeways on the Vancouver side. After the freeway plans in Vancouver were cancelled, the tunnel proposal was also abandoned, and the money originally slated for that project was instead redirected to re-establishing a passenger ferry service between Vancouver and the North Shore. The ferry proposal was included in a 1975 report by the Greater Vancouver Regional District, and the current SeaBus ferries began operating the Waterfront Station–Lonsdale Quay route on June 17, 1977, initially as part of the Transportation Division of BC Hydro. For the first few years of service, the automated fare machines (the first in Vancouver&#x27;s transit system) at the two SeaBus terminals printed an impression of the rider&#x27;s coins onto a cash register-style receipt, which could become very long if fares were paid in small-denomination coins such as pennies.

<text>Zoran Živković (Serbian Cyrillic: Зоран Живковић, pronounced , born October 5, 1948) is a Serbian writer, university professor, essayist, encyclopedist, publisher and translator. Živković&#x27;s works have been translated into 20 languages and he was awarded the 2003 World Fantasy Award.

==Biography==
In 1973, Zoran Živković graduated in literary theory from the Department of Comparative Literature in the Faculty of Philology at the University of Belgrade. He received his master&#x27;s degree in 1979 with the work “Anthropomorphism and the motif of the first contact in the works of Arthur C. Clarke” (&quot;Antropomorfizam i motiv prvog kontakta u delima Artura Klarka&quot;) and his doctorate in 1982 from the same university. His dissertation was &quot;The Appearance of Science Fiction as a Genre of Artistic Prose&quot; (&quot;Nastanak naučne fantastike kao žanra umetničke proze&quot;).

From the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, Živković was widely involved with science fiction. Apart from his two theses, he was a publisher (founding the Polaris imprint, through which he released over two hundred books), a translator (translating more than 70 books, mostly from English), an essayist (four of Živković&#x27;s books of essays appeared in this period), a researcher (producing a large, richly illustrated, two-volume &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;) and a TV host (he wrote and hosted a television series about science fiction cinema, titled &quot;The Starry Screen&quot;).

From the mid-1990s onward, Živković discontinued his engagement in SF and turned entirely to writing non-generic fiction. (In this capacity, he defines himself as &quot;a writer without any prefixes – a humble practitioner of the ancient and noble art of prose.&quot;) An early agent of his suggested Živković publish under the name &quot;Donald Livingston,&quot; to make his work more marketable in the U.S., a suggestion which Živković rejected. Between 1993 and early 2016 he wrote 21 books of fiction which were published in 81 foreign editions, 20 languages and 23 countries.

Živković has won several literary awards for his fiction. In 1994, his novel &quot;The Fourth Circle&quot; won the &quot;Miloš Crnjanski&quot; award. In 2003, Živković&#x27;s mosaic novel &quot;The Library&quot; won a &quot;World Fantasy Award&quot; for Best Novella. In 2007 his novel &quot;The Bridge&quot; won the &quot;Isidora Sekulić&quot; award. In 2007 Živković received the &quot;Stefan Mitrov Ljubiša&quot; award for his life achievement in literature. In 2014 and 2015 Živković received three awards for his contribution to the literature of fantastika: &quot;Art-Anima&quot;, &quot;Stanislav Lem&quot; and &quot;The Golden Dragon&quot;.

In 2005, Belgrade TV station &quot;Studio B&quot; produced &quot;The Collector&quot; (&quot;Sakupljač&quot;) TV series, based upon Živković&#x27;s mosaic novel &quot;Twelve Collections&quot;. In 2007, notable Serbian film author Puriša Đorđević directed the film &quot;Two&quot; (&quot;Dva&quot;), based on Živković&#x27;s fictional themes.

Two of Živković&#x27;s stories were produced as radio broadcasts by the BBC: &quot;The Train&quot; (2005) and &quot;Alarm Clock on the Night Table&quot; (2007).

The prestigious US literary magazine &quot;World Literature Today&quot; brought a special section on Živković&#x27;s writing in the November/December 2011 issue.

From 2007 to 2017, Živković was a professor in the Faculty of Philology at the University of Belgrade where he taught Creative Writing. He was initiator of the Workshop for Creative Writing (Radionica kreativnog pisanja „PričArt”) in 2011.

<text>In mechanical and control engineering, a servomechanism (also called servo system, or simply servo) is a control system for the position and its time derivatives, such as velocity, of a mechanical system. It often includes a servomotor, and uses closed-loop control to reduce steady-state error and improve dynamic response. In closed-loop control, error-sensing negative feedback is used to correct the action of the mechanism. In displacement-controlled applications, it usually includes a built-in encoder or other position feedback mechanism to ensure the output is achieving the desired effect. Following a specified motion trajectory is called servoing, where &quot;servo&quot; is used as a verb. The &quot;servo&quot; prefix originates from the Latin word &quot;servus&quot; meaning slave. 

The term correctly applies only to systems where the feedback or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed, attitude or any other measurable variables. For example, an automotive power window control is not a servomechanism, as there is no automatic feedback that controls position—the operator does this by observation. By contrast a car&#x27;s cruise control uses closed-loop feedback, which classifies it as a servomechanism.

==Applications==

===Position control===

A common type of servo provides &quot;position control&quot;. Commonly, servos are electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic. They operate on the principle of negative feedback, where the control input is compared to the actual position of the mechanical system as measured by some type of transducer at the output. Any difference between the actual and wanted values (an &quot;error signal&quot;) is amplified (and converted) and used to drive the system in the direction necessary to reduce or eliminate the error. This procedure is one widely used application of control theory. Typical servos can give a rotary (angular) or linear output.

===Speed control===
Speed control via a governor is another type of servomechanism. The steam engine uses mechanical governors; another early application was to govern the speed of water wheels. Prior to World War II the constant speed propeller was developed to control engine speed for maneuvering aircraft. Fuel controls for gas turbine engines employ either hydromechanical or electronic governing.

===Others===
Positioning servomechanisms were first used in military fire-control and marine navigation equipment. Today servomechanisms are used in automatic machine tools, satellite-tracking antennas, remote control airplanes, automatic navigation systems on boats and planes, and antiaircraft-gun control systems. Other examples are fly-by-wire systems in aircraft which use servos to actuate the aircraft&#x27;s control surfaces, and radio-controlled models which use RC servos for the same purpose. Many autofocus cameras also use a servomechanism to accurately move the lens. A hard disk drive has a magnetic servo system with sub-micrometer positioning accuracy. In industrial machines, servos are used to perform complex motion, in many applications.

==Servomotor==

A &quot;servomotor&quot; is a specific type of motor that is combined with a rotary encoder or a potentiometer to form a servomechanism. This assembly may in turn form part of another servomechanism. A potentiometer provides a simple analog signal to indicate position, while an encoder provides position and usually speed feedback, which by the use of a PID controller allow more precise control of position and thus faster achievement of a stable position (for a given motor power). Potentiometers are subject to drift when the temperature changes whereas encoders are more stable and accurate.

Servomotors are used for both high-end and low-end applications. On the high end are precision industrial components that use a rotary encoder. On the low end are inexpensive radio control servos (RC servos) used in radio-controlled models which use a free-running motor and a simple potentiometer position sensor with an embedded controller. The term &quot;servomotor&quot; generally refers to a high-end industrial component while the term &quot;servo&quot; is most often used to describe the inexpensive devices that employ a potentiometer. Stepper motors are not considered to be servomotors, although they too are used to construct larger servomechanisms. Stepper motors have inherent angular positioning, owing to their construction, and this is generally used in an open-loop manner without feedback. They are generally used for medium-precision applications.

RC servos are used to provide actuation for various mechanical systems such as the steering of a car, the control surfaces on a plane, or the rudder of a boat. Due to their affordability, reliability, and simplicity of control by microprocessors, they are often used in small-scale robotics applications. A standard RC receiver (or a microcontroller) sends pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals to the servo. The electronics inside the servo translate the width of the pulse into a position. When the servo is commanded to rotate, the motor is powered until the potentiometer reaches the value corresponding to the commanded position.

==History==

James Watt&#x27;s steam engine governor is generally considered the first powered feedback system. The windmill fantail is an earlier example of automatic control, but since it does not have an amplifier or gain, it is not usually considered a servomechanism.

The first feedback position control device was the ship steering engine, used to position the rudder of large ships based on the position of the ship&#x27;s wheel. 
John McFarlane Gray was a pioneer. His patented design was used on the SS Great Eastern in 1866.
Joseph Farcot may deserve equal credit for the feedback concept, with several patents between 1862 and 1868.

The telemotor was invented around 1872 by Andrew Betts Brown, allowing elaborate mechanisms between the control room and the engine to be greatly simplified. Steam steering engines had the characteristics of a modern servomechanism: an input, an output, an error signal, and a means for amplifying the error signal used for negative feedback to drive the error towards zero. The Ragonnet power reverse mechanism was a general purpose air or steam-powered servo amplifier for linear motion patented in 1909.

Electrical servomechanisms were used as early as 1888 in Elisha Gray&#x27;s Telautograph.

Electrical servomechanisms require a power amplifier. World War II saw the development of electrical fire-control servomechanisms, using an amplidyne as the power amplifier. Vacuum tube amplifiers were used in the UNISERVO tape drive for the UNIVAC I computer. The Royal Navy began experimenting with Remote Power Control (RPC) on HMS Champion in 1928 and began using RPC to control searchlights in the early 1930s. During WW2 RPC was used to control gun mounts and gun directors.

Modern servomechanisms use solid state power amplifiers, usually built from MOSFET or thyristor devices. Small servos may use power transistors.

The origin of the word is believed to come from the French &quot;Le Servomoteur&quot; or the slavemotor, first used by J. J. L. Farcot in 1868 to describe hydraulic and steam engines for use in ship steering.

The simplest kind of servos use bang–bang control. More complex control systems use proportional control, PID control, and state space control, which are studied in modern control theory.

==Types of performances==

Servos can be classified by means of their feedback control systems:

* type 0 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with a constant error signal;
* type 1 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with null error signal, but a constant rate of change of the reference implies a constant error in tracking the reference;
* type 2 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with null error signal. A constant rate of change of the reference implies a null error in tracking the reference. A constant rate of acceleration of the reference implies a constant error in tracking the reference.

The servo bandwidth indicates the capability of the servo to follow rapid changes in the commanded input.

<text>In economics, the marginal cost is the change in the total cost that arises when the quantity produced is increased, i.e. the cost of producing additional quantity. In some contexts, it refers to an increment of one unit of output, and in others it refers to the rate of change of total cost as output is increased by an infinitesimal amount. As Figure 1 shows, the marginal cost is measured in dollars per unit, whereas total cost is in dollars, and the marginal cost is the slope of the total cost, the rate at which it increases with output. Marginal cost is different from average cost, which is the total cost divided by the number of units produced.

At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal cost includes all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas costs that do not vary with production are fixed. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile but not the fixed cost of the factory building, which does not change with output. The marginal cost can be either short-run or long-run marginal cost, depending on what costs vary with output, since in the long run even building size is chosen to fit the desired output.

If the cost function formula_1 is continuous and differentiable, the marginal cost formula_2 is the first derivative of the cost function with respect to the output quantity formula_3:
:formula_4

If the cost function is not differentiable, the marginal cost can be expressed as follows:
:formula_5
where formula_6 denotes an incremental change of one unit.

== Short run marginal cost ==

Short run marginal cost is the change in total cost when an additional output is produced in the short run and some costs are fixed. On the right side of the page, the short-run marginal cost forms a U-shape, with quantity on the x-axis and cost per unit on the y-axis.

On the short run, the firm has some costs that are fixed independently of the quantity of output (e.g. buildings, machinery). Other costs such as labor and materials vary with output, and thus show up in marginal cost. The marginal cost may first decline, as in the diagram, if the additional cost per unit is high, if the firm operates at too low a level of output, or it may start flat or rise immediately. At some point, the marginal cost rises as increases in the variable inputs such as labor put increasing pressure on the fixed assets such as the size of the building. In the long run, the firm would increase its fixed assets to correspond to the desired output; the short run is defined as the period in which those assets cannot be changed.

== Long run marginal cost ==

The long run is defined as the length of time in which no input is fixed. Everything, including building size and machinery, can be chosen optimally for the quantity of output that is desired. As a result, even if short-run marginal cost rises because of capacity constraints, long-run marginal cost can be constant. Or, there may be increasing or decreasing returns to scale if technological or management productivity changes with the quantity. Or, there may be both, as in the diagram at the right, in which the marginal cost first falls (increasing returns to scale) and then rises (decreasing returns to scale).

== Cost functions and relationship to average cost ==
In the simplest case, the total cost function and its derivative are expressed as follows, where Q represents the production quantity, VC represents variable costs, FC represents fixed costs and TC represents total costs.

Fixed costs represent the costs that do not change as the production quantity changes. Fixed costs are costs incurred by things like rent, building space, machines, etc. Variable costs change as the production quantity changes, and are often associated with labor or materials. The derivative of fixed cost is zero, and this term drops out of the marginal cost equation: that is, marginal cost &quot;does not depend on&quot; fixed costs. This can be compared with average total cost (ATC), which is the total cost (including fixed costs, denoted C0) divided by the number of units produced:

:formula_7

For discrete calculation without calculus, marginal cost equals the change in total (or variable) cost that comes with each additional unit produced. Since fixed cost does not change in the short run, it has no effect on marginal cost.

For instance, suppose the total cost of making 1 shoe is $30 and the total cost of making 2 shoes is $40. The marginal cost of producing shoes decreases from $30 to $10 with the production of the second shoe ($40 – $30 = $10). In another example, when a fixed cost is associated, the marginal cost can be calculated as presented in the table below.

Marginal cost is not the cost of producing the &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot; unit. The cost of the last unit is the same as the cost of the first unit and every other unit. In the short run, increasing production requires using more of the variable input — conventionally assumed to be labor. Adding more labor to a fixed capital stock reduces the marginal product of labor because of the diminishing marginal returns. This reduction in productivity is not limited to the additional labor needed to produce the marginal unit – the productivity of every unit of labor is reduced. Thus the cost of producing the marginal unit of output has two components: the cost associated with producing the marginal unit and the increase in average costs for all units produced due to the &quot;damage&quot; to the entire productive process. The first component is the per-unit or average cost. The second component is the small increase in cost due to the law of diminishing marginal returns which increases the costs of all units sold.

Marginal costs can also be expressed as the cost per unit of labor divided by the marginal product of labor. Denoting variable cost as VC, the constant wage rate as w, and labor usage as L, we have
:formula_8
:formula_9

:formula_10

Here MPL is the ratio of increase in the quantity produced per unit increase in labour: i.e. ΔQ/ΔL, the marginal product of labor. The last equality holds because formula_11 is the change in quantity of labor that brings about a one-unit change in output. Since the wage rate is assumed constant, marginal cost and marginal product of labor have an inverse relationship—if the marginal product of labor is decreasing (or, increasing), then marginal cost is increasing (decreasing), and AVC = VC/Q=wL/Q = w/(Q/L) = w/APL

== Empirical data on marginal cost ==
While neoclassical models broadly assume that marginal cost will increase as production increases, several empirical studies conducted throughout the 20th century have concluded that the marginal cost is either constant or falling for the vast majority of firms. Most recently, former Federal Reserve Vice-Chair Alan Blinder and colleagues conducted a survey of 200 executives of corporations with sales exceeding $10 million, in which they were asked, among other questions, about the structure of their marginal cost curves. Strikingly, just 11% of respondents answered that their marginal costs increased as production increased, while 48% answered that they were constant, and 41% answered that they were decreasing. Summing up the results, they wrote:

Many Post-Keynesian economists have pointed to these results as evidence in favor of their own heterodox theories of the firm, which generally assume that marginal cost is constant as production increases.

== Economies of scale ==
Economies of scale apply to the long run, a span of time in which all inputs can be varied by the firm so that there are no fixed inputs or fixed costs. Production may be subject to economies of scale (or diseconomies of scale). Economies of scale are said to exist if an additional unit of output can be produced for less than the average of all previous units – that is, if long-run marginal cost is below long-run average cost, so the latter is falling. Conversely, there may be levels of production where marginal cost is higher than average cost, and the average cost is an increasing function of output. Where there are economies of scale, prices set at marginal cost will fail to cover total costs, thus requiring a subsidy. For this generic case, minimum average cost occurs at the point where average cost and marginal cost are equal (when plotted, the marginal cost curve intersects the average cost curve from below).

== Perfectly competitive supply curve ==
The portion of the marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a perfectly competitive market (the portion of the MC curve below its intersection with the AVC curve is not part of the supply curve because a firm would not operate at a price below the shutdown point). This is not true for firms operating in other market structures. For example, while a monopoly has an MC curve, it does not have a supply curve. In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller is willing and able to supply at each price – for each price, there is a unique quantity that would be supplied.

== Decisions taken based on marginal costs ==
In perfectly competitive markets, firms decide the quantity to be produced based on marginal costs and sale price. If the sale price is higher than the marginal cost, then they produce the unit and supply it. If the marginal cost is higher than the price, it would not be profitable to produce it. So the production will be carried out until the marginal cost is equal to the sale price.

== Relationship to fixed costs ==
Marginal costs are not affected by the level of fixed cost. Marginal costs can be expressed as ∆C/∆Q. Since fixed costs do not vary with (depend on) changes in quantity, MC is ∆VC/∆Q. Thus if fixed cost were to double, the marginal cost MC would not be affected, and consequently, the profit-maximizing quantity and price would not change. This can be illustrated by graphing the short run total cost curve and the short-run variable cost curve. The shapes of the curves are identical. Each curve initially increases at a decreasing rate, reaches an inflection point, then increases at an increasing rate. The only difference between the curves is that the SRVC curve begins from the origin while the SRTC curve originates on the positive part of the vertical axis. The distance of the beginning point of the SRTC above the origin represents the fixed cost – the vertical distance between the curves. This distance remains constant as the quantity produced, Q, increases. MC is the slope of the SRVC curve. A change in fixed cost would be reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the SRTC and SRVC curve. Any such change would have no effect on the shape of the SRVC curve and therefore its slope MC at any point. The changing law of marginal cost is similar to the changing law of average cost. They are both decrease at first with the increase of output, then start to increase after reaching a certain scale. While the output when marginal cost reaches its minimum is smaller than the average total cost and average variable cost. When the average total cost and the average variable cost reach their lowest point, the marginal cost is equal to the average cost.

== Private versus social marginal cost ==

Of great importance in the theory of marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal &quot;private&quot; and &quot;social&quot; costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost borne by the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their profit maximization behavior. Marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but &quot;also&quot; any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all negative and positive externalities, of both production and consumption. Examples include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties and a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection.

Externalities are costs (or benefits) that are not borne by the parties to the economic transaction. A producer may, for example, pollute the environment, and others may bear those costs. A consumer may consume a good which produces benefits for society, such as education; because the individual does not receive all of the benefits, he may consume less than efficiency would suggest. Alternatively, an individual may be a smoker or alcoholic and impose costs on others. In these cases, production or consumption of the good in question may differ from the optimum level.

=== Negative externalities of production ===
Much of the time, private and social costs do not diverge from one another, but at times social costs may be either greater or less than private costs. When the marginal social cost of production is greater than that of the private cost function, there is a negative externality of production. Productive processes that result in pollution or other environmental waste are textbook examples of production that creates negative externalities.

Such externalities are a result of firms externalizing their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost. As a result of externalizing such costs, we see that members of society who are not included in the firm will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm. In this case, an increased cost of production in society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve.

In an equilibrium state, markets creating negative externalities of production will overproduce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be lower than that observed.

=== Positive externalities of production ===
When the marginal social cost of production is less than that of the private cost function, there is a positive externality of production. Production of public goods is a textbook example of production that creates positive externalities. An example of such a public good, which creates a divergence in social and private costs, is the production of education. It is often seen that education is a positive for any whole society, as well as a positive for those directly involved in the market.

Such production creates a social cost curve that is below the private cost curve. In an equilibrium state, markets creating positive externalities of production will underproduce their good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be greater than that observed.

== Relationship between marginal cost and average total cost ==
The marginal cost intersects with the average total cost and the average variable cost at their lowest point. Take the [Relationship between marginal cost and average total cost] graph as a representation.
Say the starting point of level of output produced is n. Marginal cost is the change of the total cost from an additional output [(n+1)th unit]. Therefore, (refer to &quot;Average cost&quot; labelled picture on the right side of the screen.
In this case, when the marginal cost of the (n+1)th unit is less than the average cost(n), the average cost (n+1) will get a smaller value than average cost(n). It goes the opposite way when the marginal cost of (n+1)th is higher than average cost(n). In this case, The average cost(n+1) will be higher than average cost(n).
If the marginal cost is found lying under the average cost curve, it will bend the average cost curve downwards and if the marginal cost is above the average cost curve, it will bend the average cost curve upwards. You can see the table above where before the marginal cost curve and the average cost curve intersect, the average cost curve is downwards sloping, however after the intersection, the average cost curve is sloping upwards.
The U-shape graph reflects the law of diminishing returns. A firm can only produce so much but after the production of (n+1)th output reaches a minimum cost, the output produced after will only increase the average total cost (Nwokoye, Ebele &amp; Ilechukwu, Nneamaka, 2018).

== Profit maximization ==
The profit maximizing graph on the right side of the page represents optimal production quantity when both marginal cost and the marginal profit line intercepts. The black line represents the intersection where the profits are the greatest (marginal revenue = marginal cost). The left side of the black vertical line marked as &quot;profit-maximising quantity&quot; is where the marginal revenue is larger than marginal cost. If a firm sets its production on the left side of the graph and decides to increase the output, the additional revenue per output obtained will exceed the additional cost per output. From the &quot;profit maximizing graph&quot;, we could observe that the revenue covers both bar A and B, meanwhile the cost only covers B. Of course A+B earns you a profit but the increase in output to the point of MR=MC yields extra profit that can cover the revenue for the missing A. The firm is recommended to increase output to reach (Theory and Applications of Microeconomics, 2012).

On the other hand, the right side of the black line (Marginal revenue = marginal cost), shows that marginal cost is more than marginal revenue. Suppose a firm sets its output on this side, if it reduces the output, the cost will decrease from C and D which exceeds the decrease in revenue which is D. Therefore, decreasing output until the point of (marginal revenue=marginal cost) will lead to an increase in profit (Theory and Applications of Microeconomics, 2012).

<doc id="325502" wikidata="Q1362758" url="?curid=325502" title="Kirkland Lake">
<text>Kirkland Lake is a town and municipality in Timiskaming District of Northeastern Ontario. The 2021 population, according to Statistics Canada, was 7,750.

The community name was based on a nearby lake which in turn was named after Winnifred Kirkland, a secretary of the Ontario Department of Mines in Toronto. The lake was named by surveyor Louis Rorke in 1907. Miss Kirkland never visited the town, and the lake that bore her name did not exist as it dried because of mine tailings, but recently due to floodings of the mineshafts has come back up to about half of its initial deepness. The community comprises Kirkland Lake (Teck Township), as well as Swastika, Chaput Hughes, Bernhardt, and Morrisette Township.

Kirkland Lake was built on gold, but is also notable for its hockey players. As well, hockey broadcaster Foster Hewitt called Kirkland Lake &quot;the town that made the NHL.&quot; The town celebrated this via Hockey Heritage North, which was renamed Heritage North.

Until January 1, 1972, the town was known as Township of Teck. A by-law was introduced, on July 20, 1971, to change the municipality&#x27;s name to Town of Kirkland Lake, effective January 1, 1972.

==History==

Gold in the Kirkland Lake region was originally reported in the late 1800s by Chief Ignace Tonené of the Temagami First Nation. In fact, he staked a claim near the north arm of Larder Lake but stated it was jumped (stolen). No action was taken on his report. Chief Tonene Lake was named in his honour. Chief Ignace Tonené would go on to help form Beaverhouse First Nation.

Later, Tom Price discovered a boulder containing gold on a visit to the Kirkland Lake area in 1906.

In 1911, important claims were made along the Main Break. John Hunton staked claims on February 18, 1911, which were incorporated as the Hunton Gold Mines Ltd. in April 1914, eventually becoming part of the Amalgamated Kirkland. Stephen Orr filed claims on February 22, 1911, the basis for the Teck-Hughes Mine and the Orr Gold Mines Ltd, which was incorporated in June 1913. George Minaker staked claims on February 23, 1911, part of which he sold to (Sir) Harry Oakes in September 1912, becoming part of the Lake Shore Mine. John Reamsbottom filed claims on April 18, 1911, which became part of the Teck-Hughes Mine.

It was at Teck-Hughes mine that miners and engineers developed Teck cable for sturdy electrical transmission. That type of cable is now used on electrical projects around the world.

C.A. McKane staked claims on April 20, 1911, which became the Kirkland Lake Gold Mine. A. Maracle staked claims on June 5, 1911, which became part of the Townsite claims. Melville McDougall staked claims on June 27, 1911, which he transferred to Oakes on September 6, 1912, and became the part of the Lake Shore Mine. Jack Matchett staked a claim on July 7, 1911, later acquired by Oakes, which became part of the Townsite Mine. On July 10, 1911, Dave Elliott staked claims which became the Macassa Mine. &quot;Swift&quot; Burnside staked claims on July 26–28, 1911, which became part of the Tough-Oakes Burnside Mine. Bill Wright filed claims on July 27–29, 1911, and on September 16, 1911, with his brother-in-law Ed. Hargreaves, which became part of the Sylvanite Mine. This claim extended into the lake&#x27;s southeastern portion. More importantly, Wright found free gold near the future site of the Discovery Shaft. Ed. Horne staked a claim on October 12, 1911, which became part of the Townsite Mine, and the incorporation of Kirkland Townsite Gold Mines Ltd. in 1917. On January 8, 1912, Harry Oakes partnered with the Tough brothers plus Clem. Foster, who owned the Foster Silver Mine in Cobalt, staked claims which incorporated the No. 2 Vein and eventually led to the incorporation of Tough-Oakes Gold Mines Ltd. in 1913. Oakes filed additional claims on July 30, 1912, and Wright on August 26, 1912, both within the lake and eventually becoming parts of the Lake Shore Mine.

By 1914, there was one mine in operation, the Tough-Oakes, which included electric power transmitted from Charlton. A settlement had formed at the southwest arm of the lake, which included a post office, stores and a hotel.

In order to maximize taxation revenue from existing and potential mines in the area, the six square mile Municipal Corporation of the Township of Teck was formed with Wellington J. McLeod as the first reeve in 1919. Their first task was the establishment of public utilities, including roads and water pipes, in the rapidly growing area.
Kirkland Lake had numerous mines, in the early years, including the Teck-Hughes (1917–1968), Lake Shore (1918–1968), Kirkland Minerals (1919–1960), Wright-Hargreaves (1921–1965), Sylvanite (1927–1961), Tough-Oakes-Burnside (later Toburn) (1913–1953), and Macassa Mine (1933–1999).

The Kirkland Lake camp produced $636,667 worth of gold in 1918 and that rose to a value of $17,000,000 in 1930. As Pain points out, &quot;Kirkland Lake camp came to occupy a position of real importance in the mining world.&quot; By 1934, the production had reached $34,000,000 and 2,000,000 tons were being milled annually. Peak employment of 4,761 wage earners occurred in 1939, but that dropped to 2,064 by 1944. The 1939 population was 24,200.

Early in the Second World War gold production in the area decreased due to personnel being lost to more essential war industries. In 1942, gold mining was declared a non-essential industry to the war effort which resulted in gold mines across the country being at a lower priority for personnel and supplies relative to producers of base metals. After the war, local soldiers returned to the newly created Federal area in the northern section of the town. The Kirkland Lake Cemetery is a member of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and is the location of the graves of 12 soldiers, and 3 airmen of the Canadian forces who died during the Second World War.

Kirkland Lake&#x27;s first fire hall was established in 1935 and the second fire hall in 1955.

In 1963 the open-pit Adams Mine began developing its iron ore resources. The mine would stay in production until 1990.

The Kirkland Lake Community Complex, now the Joe Mavrinac Community Complex, opened in 1979. Home of the Kirkland Lake Aquatic Club (KLAC) which has been the starting point for Dominique Bouchard - Olympic Swimmer, Rodney Thomas - Canada Games Double Gold medalist and numerous other university Varsity level scholarship swimmers.

In the early 1980s, LAC Minerals reopened the main shaft of the Lake Shore Mine and worked it from 1982 to 1987 to extract pockets of gold that had been left behind. Between 1987 and 1991 Vancouver based Eastmaque Gold Mines reprocessed tailings, or &quot;slimes&quot;, from early inefficient mill operations, extracting 70,000 ounces of gold.

Between October and December 1988, Kirkland Lake was the filming location for the drama film &quot;Termini Station&quot; (1989).

On the morning of Sunday, May 20, 2012, a forest fire was discovered about north of Kirkland Lake, which grew to by the afternoon of May 21, causing a state of emergency to be declared. Residential and cottage areas on Goodfish Lake and Nettie Lakes and one street in Chaput Hughes were evacuated that afternoon. Kirkland Lake Gold and AuRico Gold suspended operations due to fire damage to power lines and local schools were closed. On May 29, the state of emergency was lifted, as the fire was determined to be no longer a threat to Kirkland Lake, although it was not yet under control.

On December 18, 2012, the town council voted to have fluoride removed from the local water treatment facility, after a breakdown left the town with a bill of $360,000.

==Geography==
Kirkland Lake includes the townships of Teck, Bernhardt and Morrisette.

Kirkland Lake is located in the resource-rich Precambrian Shield, an ancient geological core of the North American continent. Nearby is the Arctic Watershed, a drainage divide at an elevation of . Rivers south of that elevation flow into a drainage basin which includes Lake Ontario and the Saint Lawrence River, while rivers north of the watershed flow into Hudson Bay.

Noticeable local landmarks include Mount Cheminis, rising above sea level, and many small kettle lakes, scraped out of the rock during the last Ice Age and filled with clear water.

Black spruce, jack pine, trembling aspen, white birch, white spruce, balsam poplar, and balsam fir are the dominant trees in the area. A prominent forest form in this part of the black spruce distribution is the black spruce/feathermoss climax forest, which characteristically exhibits moderately dense canopy and features a forest floor of feathermosses. Moose, beaver, muskrat, snowshoe hare, as well as numerous predators roam this area, including marten, ermine, fisher, otter, black bear, wolf, and lynx. The many wetlands and lakes support a diversity of bird species, such as great blue herons, ducks, geese, and that symbol of the north, the common loon. Ground and tree dwelling birds are also plentiful, including grouse, partridge, robins, blue jays, and Canada jays as well as birds of prey such as hawks.

===Geology===
Kirkland Lake is located within the Abitibi greenstone belt and the Abitibi gold belt. The main geologic feature in the Kirkland Lake Camp is the Kirkland Lake Break, or Main Break. This Break is a vein located along a thrust fault extending east to west and dipping steeply to the south. The area mine shafts are all located along this Break. Gold occurs in quartz veins in spatial relationship to this fault. The major mines in 1960, trending east to west, included Toburn, Sylvanite, Wright-Hargreaves, Lake Shore, Teck Hughes, Kirkland Minerals, and Macassa.

In the early days of staking claims, most prospectors tried to understand the lateral extent of this east–west trending vein defining the Main Break, as well as the associated veins paralleling it, e.g. South Vein, No. 2 Vein, No. 6 Vein, No. 7 Vein, etc. Most importantly, prospecting was extensive in the hopes the vein extended under the southern portion of Kirkland Lake.

Telluride minerals were present in the Tough-Oakes ore. They are also present in the Sylvanite Mine, though sylvanite is not one of them. The Sylvanite Mine started a 200-ton mill in 1927 and shafts reached by 1930.

Kirkland Lake Gold Mines Ltd. was incorporated in 1913 before the property was taken over by Cobalt&#x27;s Beaver Consolidated Mines Ltd. after a shaft was sunk . They formed the Kirkland Lake Gold Mining Company in 1915 and the main shaft was sunk , which prompted the building on a mill in 1919. Shafts reached a depth of before the mine closed in 1924. Operations restarted in 1926 with new financing organized by Dr. J.B. Tyrrell, and high-grade ore was found at . By 1930, the mine had reached a depth of and had acquired the Chaput-Highes claim to the south. The property was acquired by the Kirkland Minerals Corporation in 1956.

Tough-Oakes produced 213 tons of high-grade ore in 1914. Operations included a five-stamp mill for amalgamation plus a cyanide plant. However, the presence of high-grade ore in the vein terminated at the level and the mine shut down in 1918. This property was consolidated with Burnside&#x27;s to form Tough-Oakes Burnside Gold Mines Ltd. in 1923 and the Burnside No. 3 shaft was deepened to . The operation went bankrupt in 1928. Operations restarted as the Toburn in 1932, as a subsidiary of the American Smelting and Refining Company.

Lake Shore Mines Ltd. was incorporated in February 1914. Oakes proceeded with sending a crosscut from his shaft on the South Vein towards the anticipated Main Break under the lake to the north. This crosscut encountered high-grade ore and a 100-ton mill was in operation by March 1918. Their No. 1 shaft reached a depth of and their No. shaft a depth of by 1930 and was considered &quot;the wonder mine&quot; by Pain. There was 1,600 feet of high-grade ore at the 1,000-foot level and at the 2,400-foot level.

Wright-Hargreaves Mines Ltd. was incorporated in 1916. The Wright-Hargreaves Mine had a 100-ton a day mill operating by 1921 and shafts reached a depth of by 1930. Almost of high-grade ore was found between the level down to .

In 1916, the Teck-Hughes Mine built a 50-ton cyanide mill after the No. 1 shaft reached a depth of . In 1923, the company was reorganized as Teck-Highes Gold Mines Ltd, which included the Orr claim to the south. The central shaft reached a depth of and a south shaft was sunk in 1928 to reach a depth of . A 1000-ton per day mill was in operation by 1930. High-grade ore of up to was found on six levels.

Macassa Mines Ltd. was organized in 1926, which included the Elliott claims. Mill operations started in 1933 and acquired the United Kirkland Gold Mines Ltd. claims to the south.

The lake itself was gradually filled in by mill tailings, such that the water had disappeared by 1930. By 1960, of underground workings were in the Kirkland Lake camp and of direct hoisting shafts. The Lake Shore and Wright-Hargreaves mines had the deepest working depths in the world, at below the surface.

===Climate===
Kirkland Lake enjoys four distinct seasons. Spring and autumn offer a mix of warm sunny days and crisp, cool nights. Summers are comfortably warm, with dry air and temperatures reaching into the mid-20-degree Celsius range (mid-70s Fahrenheit). Winter temperatures may seem brisk, but high winds and high humidity are rare, allowing residents to take full advantage of outside recreational activities.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kirkland Lake had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==

The town experienced an economic decline in the late 1900s, with the closing of the original mines. That ended in 2001, when Foxpoint Resources (now Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. or KLG) bought five of the mining claims in the town and began intensive exploration work. KLG successfully resuscitated the local mining scene, finding new zones of mineralization that, combined with the steadily increasing price of gold, turned the town around. Today, Kirkland Lake is probably one of the most successful communities of its size in Northern Ontario. Some of the more recent developments include:
* Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. continues to expand its operations. Since December 2002, the company&#x27;s confirmed gold reserves have increased by 160% to 2,022,000 tons with an average grade of 0.46 ounces per ton containing a total of 927,000 ounces of gold. In 2003, the Company started a $21 million, 3-year exploration program targeted at adding 15,000,000 tons of ore to reserves and resources. Currently, over 500 personnel are directly or indirectly employed at the mine site. Based on today&#x27;s resources, the mine has a 12-15 year life span. A recently announced $16 million expansion in its exploration activities is already paying dividends. The mine recently announced the discovery of the richest ore veins ever found in the history of the Kirkland Lake camp, a move which will significantly increase the mine&#x27;s life span.
*While the forestry industry has been hard hit across Canada, the impact on Kirkland Lake has been mitigated by the conversion of the existing Tembec Forest Products Group&#x27;s Kenogami sawmill into a value-added centre for the manufacturing of finger-jointed lumber. The new centre, located on the outskirts of KL, opened in July 2006. It will employ between 70 and 92 workers. Under an innovative Public-Private partnership, the municipality is working with Rosko Forestry Operations to establish a specialty sawmill in the Archer Drive Industrial Park that will sell into the Canadian market.
* The local tourism industry has provided a much needed depth to the local economy. Star attractions include the Museum of Northern History at the Sir Harry Oakes Chateau, the Miners&#x27; Memorial, and Heritage North (an interactive facility telling the story of hockey in the north). Upcoming attractions include a refurbishment of the historical Toburn Headframe. Event based tourism is also strong. Some of the most popular draws include a drag racing event in the summer and a national snow cross racing event in the winter.
* Prospects for an expansion of the Town&#x27;s white-collar workforce are excellent. Two new high schools as well as a long-term care facility, and a new medical centre promise to make the community more attractive to professionals in the fields of medicine and education. Veterans Affairs Canada is also growing its client service operations. The local office is now the primary service bureau for over 100,000 clients across central and eastern Canada.

Through the 1990s, one of the town&#x27;s dominant political and economic controversies surrounded a proposal to ship Toronto&#x27;s garbage to the Adams Mine, an abandoned open pit mine in Boston Township just outside Kirkland Lake.

Kirkland Lake is also self-sufficient when it comes to power production with a generator that produces up to 117MW.

Kirkland Lake also has a shopping mall with stores including Dollarama, easyhome, Hart Stores, Giant Tiger, and Topper&#x27;s Pizza. The mall also includes local businesses, such as Nail World, a nail salon, and Elegance by Jen, a local hairdresser. It is also the location of the Ontario Northland bus stop.

==Arts and culture==
 The Kirkland Lake area continues to support a strong tourist industry throughout the year. The summers are met with a number of anglers, hunters, and campers looking for adventure. Winters are especially popular as a result of the well maintained snow mobile trails in the area. There are also a number of tourist destinations in the area, including the recently developed Hockey Heritage North. It also has a strong community built on music. Local attractions include:
* Kirkland Lake Miners&#x27; Memorial.
* Blueberry Festival - an annual summer event at Esker Lakes Provincial Park.
* Toburn Mine - This mine was the first producing mine in Kirkland Lake and the old headframe is a recognized cultural asset.
* Wright-Hargreaves Park - Site of the former Wright-Hargreaves mine that used to be one of the most productive and deepest gold mines in the world.
* Homecoming Week - during the week of Canada Day (July 1).
* Winter Carnival - beginning in mid-February.

===Homecoming Week===

The Kirkland Lake Festivals Committee hosts an annual homecoming week. Many former residents return home for the celebrations. The 2019 homecoming week was a celebration of the community&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

Homecoming events included free kids events, Shakespeare in the Park, a BMX, skateboard and scooter extreme park competition, a local food fair, free kids matinees, splash park events, golf tournaments, A day in the park at the Toburn Mine site, fireworks and more. The Festivals Committee also hosts free Canada Day celebrations with fireworks.

As of 2022, the Homecoming Week was cancelled indefinitely.

===Winter Carnival===

The Kirkland Lake Festivals Committee hosts an annual winter carnival beginning in mid-February. With 18 days of events each year, Kirkland Lake&#x27;s Winter Carnival is one of Canada&#x27;s longest winter carnivals. Festivals and Events Ontario has honoured the event with multiple Top 100 Festival awards.

The 2018 Kirkland Lake Winter Carnival featured 18 days of events between February 15–March 4 including: the Alamos Gold $50,000 Ice Fishing Derby, Hockey Tournament, Kids Winter Jam Party featuring the Stars of Pop, 3 nights of Kabaret, Kirkland Lake Skating Club&#x27;s Ice Show, fireworks, free sleigh rides, a comedy night, free skating parties, a magic show, free kids matinees and the NorthernTel Kids Carnival on the Family Day holiday.

As of 2022, the Winter Carnival was cancelled and events were to be made by the companies and groups on their own, as the Festivals Committee has shut down.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Inter-city bus services are provided by Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services. A staffed bus station is located at the Kirkland Lake Mall and busses also make flag stops at the site of the former railway station in Swastika.

The Ontario Northland Railway mainline passes through the municipality, with a branch freight line diverging at Swastika east toward Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. Swastika station was a stop for ONR&#x27;s &quot;Northlander&quot; passenger train until the service was discontinued in 2012. The stop will be renamed &quot;Kirkland Lake&quot; and a new permanent heated passenger shelter, replacing the station that was demolished in 2020, will be constructed on the site between 2024–2026 in preparation for ONR resuming &quot;Northlander&quot; service in the mid-2020s.

The Kirkland Lake Airport is located outside of the town and serves general aviation. The nearest airports offering scheduled passenger services are Timmins Victor M. Power Airport and Rouyn-Noranda Airport. 

Local transportation is also provided to senior citizens and persons with disabilities.

===Healthcare===
The Blanche River Health Kirkland Lake site, formerly known as the Kirkland and District Hospital, serves the area.

==Education==
Kirkland Lake has two secondary schools, each catering to a different language group: the École secondaire catholique l&#x27;Envolée du Nord, a French Catholic school; and the Kirkland Lake District Composite School, an English secondary school also featuring French immersion instruction (opened in 2006; from 1923 - 2006 students attended Kirkland Lake Collegiate and Vocational Institute, also known as KLCVI).

Elementary schools in Kirkland Lake include Central Public School (French immersion, public), Federal Public School (English, public), Sacred Heart School, (French immersion and English, Catholic), St. Jerome School (French immersion and English, Catholic), and Ecole Assomption (French, Catholic).

The community is also home to a campus of the Northern College of Applied Arts and Technology.

Northern College offers one-, two- and three-year programs in the fields of technology, business, human services, health and emergency services and veterinary sciences. Northern also offers post-diploma, apprenticeship, skills and job re-entry programs funded by the federal and provincial governments. The college also provides job related training. This includes providing the facilities for the delivery of third party programs, or the development of courses to meet the needs of a company.

Kirkland Lake also includes the Teck Centennial Public Library.

<text>The dharmakāya (, &quot;truth body&quot; or &quot;reality body&quot;, , ) is one of the three bodies (&quot;trikāya&quot;) of a Buddha in Mahāyāna Buddhism. The &quot;dharmakāya&quot; constitutes the unmanifested, &quot;inconceivable&quot; (&quot;acintya&quot;) aspect of a Buddha out of which Buddhas arise and to which they return after their dissolution. Buddhas are manifestations of the &quot;dharmakāya&quot; called the &quot;nirmāṇakāya&quot;, &quot;transformation body&quot;.

The Dhammakāya tradition of Thailand and the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha sūtras&quot; of the ancient Indian tradition view the &quot;dharmakāya&quot; as the &quot;ātman&quot; (true self) of the Buddha present within all beings.

== Origins and development ==

=== Pāli Canon ===

In the Pāli Canon, Gautama Buddha tells Vasettha that the Tathāgata (the Buddha) is &quot;dhammakaya&quot;, the &quot;truth-body&quot; or the &quot;embodiment of truth&quot;, as well as &quot;dharmabhuta&quot;, &quot;truth-become&quot;, that is, &quot;one who has become truth.&quot;

=== Trikaya doctrine ===

The &quot;trikaya doctrine&quot; (Sanskrit, literally &quot;three bodies&quot; or &quot;three personalities&quot;) is a Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and the appearances of a Buddha.

The &quot;dharmakaya&quot; doctrine was possibly first expounded in the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā&quot;, composed in the 1st century BCE.

Around 300 CE, the yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the &quot;trikaya&quot; &quot;three-body&quot; doctrine. According to this doctrine, buddhahood has three aspects:
# The &quot;nirmāṇakāya&quot;, &quot;transformation body&quot;
# The &quot;sambhogakāya&quot;, &quot;enjoyment-body&quot;
# The &quot;dharmakāya&quot;, &quot;dharma-body&quot;

=== Qualities ===
Tulku Thondup states that &quot;dharmakaya&quot; must possess three great qualities:

# &quot;Great purity&quot; (, &quot;the great abandonment&quot;),
# &quot;Great realization&quot; (),
# &quot;Great mind&quot; ().

== Interpretation in Buddhist traditions ==
=== Mahāsāṃghika ===
According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in Mahāsāṃghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means. For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the &quot;dharmakāya&quot;.

=== Sarvāstivāda ===
Sarvāstivādins viewed the Buddha&#x27;s physical body (Skt. ) as being impure and improper for taking refuge in, and they instead regarded taking refuge in the Buddha as taking refuge in the dharmakāya of the Buddha. As stated in the &quot;Mahāvibhāṣā&quot;:

=== Theravāda ===
In the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhism, the &quot;Dhammakāya&quot; (&quot;dharmakāya&quot;) is explained as a figurative term, meaning the &quot;body&quot; or the sum of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings. The Canon does not invest the term &quot;dhammakāya&quot; with a metaphysical or unrealistic connotation. Jantrasrisalai disagrees though, arguing that the term originally was more connected with the process of enlightenment than the way it later came to be interpreted. In all references to dhammakāya in early Buddhist usage, it is apparent that dhammakāya is linked always with the process of enlightenment in one way or another. Its relation with the Buddhist noble ones of all types is evident in the early Buddhist texts. That is to say, dhammakāya is not exclusive to the Buddha. It appears also that the term’s usage in the sense of teaching is a later schema rather than being the early Buddhist common notions as generally understood.

In the &quot;atthakathā&quot;s (commentaries on the Buddhist texts), the interpretation of the word depends on the author. Though both Buddhaghoṣa and Dhammapāla describe &quot;dhammakāya&quot; as the nine supramundane states (&quot;navalokuttaradhamma&quot;), their interpretations differ in other aspects. Buddhaghoṣa always follows the canonical interpretation, referring to the &quot;teaching&quot; of the &quot;lokuttaradhamma&quot;s, but Dhammapāla interprets &quot;dhammakāya&quot; as the &quot;spiritual attainments&quot; of the Buddha. Dhammapāla&#x27;s interpretation is still essentially Theravāda though, since the Buddha is still considered a human being, albeit an enlightened one. The Buddha&#x27;s body is still subject to &quot;kamma&quot; and limited in the same way as other people&#x27;s bodies are.

In a post-canonical Sri Lankan text called Saddharmaratnākaraya, a distinction is drawn between four different &quot;kāya&quot;s: the &quot;rūpakāya&quot;, &quot;dharmakāya&quot;, &quot;nimittakāya&quot; and &quot;suñyakāya&quot;. The &quot;rūpakāya&quot; refers to the four &quot;jhāna&quot;s here; the &quot;dharmakāya&quot; refers to the attainment of the first eight of the nine &quot;lokuttaradhamma&quot;s; the &quot;nimittakāya&quot; refers to the final &quot;lokuttaradhamma&quot;: &quot;Nibbāna&quot; with a physical remainder (&quot;sopadisesanibbāna&quot;); and the &quot;suñyakāya&quot; refers to &quot;Nibbāna&quot; without physical remainder (&quot;anupādisesanibbāna&quot;). However, even this teaching of four &quot;kāya&quot;s does not really stray outside of orthodox Theravāda tradition.

In a more unorthodox approach, Maryla Falk has made the argument that in the earliest form of Buddhism, a yogic path existed which involved the acquisition of a &quot;manomayakāya&quot; or &quot;dhammakāya&quot; and an &quot;amatakāya&quot;, in which the &quot;manomayakāya&quot; or &quot;dhammakāya&quot; refers to the attainment of the &quot;jhānas&quot;, and the &quot;amatakāya&quot; to the attainment of insight and the culmination of the path. In this case, the &quot;kāyas&quot; refer to a general path and fruit, not only to the person of the Buddha. Although Reynolds does not express agreement with Falk&#x27;s entire theory, he does consider the idea of an earlier yogic strand worthy of investigation. Furthermore, he points out that there are remarkable resemblances with interpretations that can be found in &quot;Yogāvacara&quot; texts, often called Tantric Theravada.

The usage of the word &quot;dhammakāya&quot; is common in Tantric Theravāda texts. It is also a common term in later texts concerning the consecration of Buddha images. In these later texts, which are often descriptions of &quot;kammaṭṭhāna&quot; (meditation methods), different parts of the body of the Buddha are associated with certain spiritual attainments, and the practitioner determines to pursue these attainments himself. The idea that certain characteristics or attainments of the Buddha can be pursued is usually considered a Mahāyāna idea, but unlike Mahāyāna, Yogāvacara texts do not describe the Buddha in ontological terms, and commonly use only Theravāda terminology.

==== Dhammakaya tradition ====

The Dhammakaya tradition and some monastic members of Thai Theravada Buddhism, who specialise on meditation, have doctrinal elements which distinguish it from some Theravāda Buddhist scholars who have tried to claim themselves as the orthodox Buddhists. Basing itself on the Pali suttas and meditative experience, the tradition teaches that the &quot;dhammakaya&quot; is the eternal Buddha within all beings. The &quot;dhammakaya&quot; is &quot;nibbāna&quot;, and &quot;nibbāna&quot; is equated with the true self (as opposed to the non-self). In some respects its teachings resemble the buddha-nature doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism. Paul Williams has commented that this view of Buddhism is similar to ideas found in the shentong teachings of the Jonang school of Tibet made famous by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen.

The Thai meditation masters who teach of a true self of which they claim to have gained meditative experience are not rejected by Thai Buddhists in general, but tend, on the contrary, to be particularly revered and worshipped in Thailand as arahats or even &quot;bodhisattvas&quot;, far more so than more orthodox Theravada monks and scholars.

=== Mahāyāna ===

==== Prajnaparamita ====
According to Paul Williams, there are three ways of seeing the concept of the &quot;dharmakaya&quot; in the &quot;prajnaparamita&quot; sutras:
==== &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; ====
In the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; (Chapter 16: The Life Span of Thus Come One, sixth fascicle) the Buddha explains that he has always and will always exist to lead beings to their salvation.

==== Tathāgatagarbha ====
In the tathagatagarbha sutric tradition, the &quot;dharmakaya&quot; is taught by the Buddha to constitute the transcendental, blissful, eternal, and pure Self of the Buddha. &quot;These terms are found in sutras such as the &quot;Lankavatara&quot;, &quot;Gandavyuha&quot;, &quot;Angulimaliya&quot;, &quot;Srimala&quot;, and the &quot;Mahaparinirvana&quot;, where they are used to describe the Buddha, the Truth Body (&quot;dharmakaya&quot;) and the Buddha-nature.&quot; They are the &quot;transcendent results [of spiritual attainment]&quot;.

==== Tibetan Buddhism ====

In Tibetan, the term &quot;chos sku&quot; (ཆོས་སྐུ།, phonetically written as &quot;chö-ku&quot;) glosses &quot;dharmakāya&quot;; it is composed of &quot;chos&quot; &quot;religion, dharma&quot; and &quot;sku&quot; &quot;body, form, image, bodily form, figure&quot;. Thondup &amp; Talbott render it as the &quot;ultimate body&quot;. Gyurme Dorje and Thupten Jinpa define &quot;Buddha-body of Reality&quot;, which is a rendering of the Tibetan &quot;chos-sku&quot; and the Sanskrit &quot;dharmakāya&quot;, as:

The Dalai Lama defines the dharmakaya as &quot;the realm of the Dharmakaya—the space of emptiness—where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras.&quot; However he also states that it is distinct from the Hindu concept of Brahman because Buddhism adheres to the doctrine of emptiness (sunyata).

===== Rime movement =====
According to Jamgon Kongtrul, the founder of the Rimé movement, in his 19th century commentary to the Lojong slogan, &quot;To see confusion as the four kayas, the sunyata protection is unsurpassable&quot;, &quot;When you rest in a state where appearances simply appear but there is no clinging to them, the &quot;dharmakaya&quot; aspect is that all appearances are empty in nature, the &quot;sambhogakāya&quot; is that they appear with clarity, the &quot;nirmanakaya&quot; is that this emptiness and clarity occur together, and the natural &quot;kāya&quot; aspect is that these are inseparable.&quot;

== Iconography ==

=== Emptiness ===
In the early traditions of Buddhism, depictions of Gautama Buddha were neither iconic nor aniconic but depictions of empty space and absence: petrosomatoglyphs (images of a part of the body carved in rock), for example.

=== Sky blue ===
Thondup and Talbott identify dharmakaya with the naked (&quot;sky-clad&quot;; Sanskrit: ), unornamented, sky-blue Samantabhadra:
Fremantle states:
The colour blue is an iconographic polysemic rendering of the &quot;mahābhūta&quot; element of the &quot;pure light&quot; of space (Sanskrit: ).

The conceptually bridging and building poetic device of analogy, as an exemplar where &quot;dharmakaya&quot; is evocatively likened to sky and space, is a persistent and pervasive visual metaphor throughout the early Dzogchen and Nyingma literature and functions as a linkage and conduit between the &#x27;conceptual&#x27; and &#x27;conceivable&#x27; and the &#x27;ineffable&#x27; and &#x27;inconceivable&#x27; (Sanskrit: ). It is particularly referred to by the &quot;terma&quot; &quot;Gongpa Zangtel&quot;, a terma cycle revealed by Rigdzin Gödem (1337–1408) and part of the Nyingma &quot;Northern Treasures&quot; ().

=== Mirror ===
Sawyer conveys the importance of &quot;melong&quot; (&#x27;mirror&#x27;) iconography to &quot;dharmakaya&quot;:

<text>Catherine Ann Asaro (born November 6, 1955) is an American science fiction and fantasy author, singer and teacher. She is best known for her books about the Ruby Dynasty, called the Saga of the Skolian Empire.

== Biography ==
Catherine Asaro was born on November 6, 1955, in Oakland, California, and grew up in El Cerrito, California. She attended Kennedy High School in Richmond, California, as part of the Richmond Voluntary Integration Plan. She has a B.S. with highest honors in chemistry from UCLA, and both a master&#x27;s in physics and a PhD in chemical physics from Harvard University.

When not writing and making appearances at conventions and signings, Asaro teaches math, physics, and chemistry. She was director of the Chesapeake Math Program and has coached various nationally ranked teams with home, private, and public school students, in particular the Chesapeake teams for national tournaments such as the Princeton and Harvard-MIT competitions. She also taught a gifted program in math and science at the Yang Academy in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Her students have placed at the top levels in numerous national competitions, including the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) and the United States of America Mathematical Talent Search (USAMTS).

Asaro is a member of SIGMA, a think tank of speculative writers that advises the government as to future trends affecting national security. She is also known for her advocacy of bringing girls and women into STEM fields and for increased diversity, and for challenging gender roles and literary expectations in her fiction. She has been an invited speaker or visiting professor for various institutions, including the National Academy of Sciences, Harvard, Georgetown University, NASA, The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), The Global Competitiveness Forum in Saudi Arabia, the New Zealand National ConText Writer&#x27;s program, the University of Maryland, the US Naval Academy, and many other institutions.

A former ballet and jazz dancer, Catherine Asaro has performed with dance companies and in musicals on both coasts and in Ohio. She founded and served as artistic director and a principal dancer for two dance groups at Harvard: The Mainly Jazz Dance Company and the Harvard University Ballet. After she graduated, her undergraduate students took over Mainly Jazz and made it into a club at the college.

She has completed two terms as president of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) (2003–2005) and during her tenure established the Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy.

===Family===
Her husband was John Kendall Cannizzo (1957–2018), an astrophysicist at NASA. They have one daughter, a ballet dancer who studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge and UC Berkeley.

Catherine Asaro is the daughter of Frank Asaro, the nuclear chemist who discovered the iridium anomaly that led the team of Luis Alvarez, Walter Alvarez, Frank Asaro, and Helen Michel to postulate that an asteroid collided with the Earth 66 million years ago and caused mass extinctions, including the demise of the dinosaurs.

== Saga of the Skolian Empire series ==

The Saga of the Skolian Empire, informally called the Skolian Saga, is a series of science fiction novels, novelettes and novellas revolving around characters from an interstellar empire known as the Skolian Empire and their power struggle with the rival Eubian Concord. The arc of the books unfolds over several generations of characters and revolves around political intrigues, but also contains subplots regarding romance, physics, bio-enhancements, and virtual computer networks.

== Mathematical fiction and hard science fiction==
Asaro is known as a hard science fiction writer for the scientific depth of her work. The amount of science varies from book to book, with novels such as &quot;Primary Inversion&quot;, &quot;The Radiant Seas&quot;, and &quot;Spherical Harmonic&quot; on the most scientifically dense end of the spectrum, including elements such as equations and diagrams of quantum mechanical wave functions and Klein bottles. Stanley Schmidt, the long time editor of &quot;Analog&quot; magazine, wrote that &quot;Primary Inversion&quot; is &quot;an impressive first novel; not just a good story, but the kind of speculation we too seldom see – really new science that just might be possible.&quot; Asaro is noted as one of the few female science fiction writers who also has a doctorate in hard science, in Asaro&#x27;s case a PhD from Harvard in theoretical Chemical Physics.

Asaro is also noted for including sophisticated mathematical concepts in her fiction. The method of space travel used in the Skolian Empire books comes from a paper Asaro wrote on complex variables and special relativity that appeared in the &quot;American Journal of Physics&quot;. The novel &quot;Spherical Harmonic&quot; involves an imagined universe based on the Hilbert space described by the spherical harmonic eigenfunctions that solve the Laplace Equation, and some prose in the book is written in the shape of the sinusoidal waves found in the spherical harmonics. Her novel &quot;The Quantum Rose&quot; is an allegory to quantum scattering theory and is dedicated to her doctoral advisors and mentors in the subject, Alex Dalgarno, Kate Kirby, and Eric J. Heller. The novella &quot;Aurora in Four Voices&quot; includes topics ranging from Fourier series to integration problems in calculus. In essays in the back of some of her novels, Asaro explains the mathematical and physics basis of the ideas used in the books, in particular &quot;Spherical Harmonic,&quot; &quot;The Quantum Rose,&quot; and &quot;The Moon&#x27;s Shadow.&quot; In the anthology &quot;Aurora in Four Voices&quot; (which includes the novella of the same name), Asaro describes the mathematical basis of several stories in the anthology, including the use of Fourier transforms, Riemann sheets, and complex numbers in &quot;The SpaceTime Pool.&quot;

== Musical collaborations ==
=== The Diamond Star Project ===
The Diamond Star Project is a collaboration between Catherine Asaro and the rock musicians Point Valid. The project resulted in a CD, &quot;Diamond Star&quot; (Starflight Music, April 2009), which is a &quot;soundtrack&quot; for the book, &quot;Diamond Star&quot; (Baen Books). The novel tells the story of Del-Kurj, a Ruby Dynasty prince who would rather be a rock singer than sit on the throne. The lyrics to the songs appear in the novel &quot;Diamond Star&quot; and were the inspiration for the CD.

Point Valid is an alternative band originating in Baltimore, Maryland, with Hayim Ani on vocals and guitar, Adam Leve on drums and Max Vidaver on guitar. Ani wrote most of the music for the CD, and Asaro wrote most of the lyrics, as well as music for three songs. Ani also contributed three original compositions, both music and lyrics. Most of the vocals are by Ani, with a few by Asaro. The CD has twelve songs, eleven originals and a cover of &quot;Sound of Silence&quot;. Asaro, who did not know how to sing, took voice lessons in preparation for the recordings, and continues to train and perform. Asaro has described how the collaboration inspired her work, as exemplified by the song &quot;Emeralds&quot;, which she was not able to finish until she and Ani were in the studio recording his vocals.

During 2009, the Diamond Star Project expanded to include Donald Wolcott, a jazz pianist who accompanied Asaro in concerts. In 2010, Starflight Music released the EP &quot;Goodbye Note&quot; by Asaro and Wolcott, which includes the song &quot;No Answers with in Paradisum&quot; from the &quot;Diamond Star&quot; soundtrack, rewritten and sung by Asaro. In 2010, Marty Pell joined the Diamond Star Project as an additional pianist, and in 2011, Greg Adams replaced Wolcott as Asaro&#x27;s primary accompanist.

=== Arlan Andrews ===
In 2018, Asaro teamed up with author and songwriter Arlan Andrews to do the Celtic rock song &quot;Ancient Ages&quot;.

<text>Ted Chiang (; pinyin: &quot;Jiāng Fēngnán&quot;; born 1967) is an American science fiction writer. His work has won four Nebula awards, four Hugo awards, the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, and six Locus awards. He has published the short story collections &quot;Stories of Your Life and Others&quot; (2002) and &quot;&quot; (2019). His short story &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; was the basis of the film &quot;Arrival&quot; (2016). He was an artist in residence at the University of Notre Dame from 2020 to 2021. Chiang is also a frequent non-fiction contributor to the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, where he writes on topics related to computing such as artificial intelligence.

== Early life and education ==
Ted Chiang was born in 1967 to a Taiwanese American family in Port Jefferson, New York. His Chinese name is Chiang Feng-nan (; ). Both of his parents are Taiwanese &quot;waishengren&quot; who were born in mainland China and migrated to Taiwan with their families during the retreat of the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan before immigrating to the United States. His father, Fu-pen Chiang, is a distinguished professor of mechanical engineering at Stony Brook University. His mother ( 2019) was a librarian. Chiang also has a sister who is a physician. 

Chiang grew up in Long Island and, at age 15, began submitting science fiction stories to magazines. He later recalled, &quot;When I was a kid, my intention was to become a physicist. That was a perfectly respectable career choice for the son of an engineer. I figured I would be a fiction writer on the side, and that, I think, is perfectly acceptable to Asian parents&quot;. In 1989, he graduated from Brown University with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree after choosing to study computer science over physics. As an undergraduate, Chiang continued to write sci-fi stories, though they were ultimately unpublished.

== Career ==
After attending and graduating from the Clarion Workshop in 1989 Chiang sold his first story, &quot;The Tower of Babylon&quot;, to &quot;Omni&quot; magazine, and was awarded a Nebula Award for it in 1990. His later stories have won numerous other awards, making him one of the most-honored writers in contemporary science fiction. Chiang&#x27;s first short story collection, &quot;Stories of Your Life and Others&quot; (2002) was published in 2002 by Tor Books and comprises his first eight stories. The collection was reprinted in 2016 as &quot;Arrival&quot; to coincide with the adaptation of &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; as the film &quot;Arrival&quot;.

, Chiang was working as a technical writer in the software industry and resided in Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle. He was an instructor at the Clarion Workshop at UC San Diego in 2012 and 2016.

Chiang&#x27;s second short story collection, &quot;&quot; was published in May 2019 by Alfred A. Knopf. Chiang has published eighteen short stories, novelettes, and novellas In 2022, Chiang became a Miller Scholar in the Santa Fe Institute.

In 2023, Chiang was named one of &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 most influential people in AI.

== Writing style and influences ==
Chiang has said Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke inspired him when he was young, while the works of Gene Wolfe, John Crowley and Edward Bryant were his creative influences in college. 

Chiang has said that one of the reasons science fiction writing interests him is that it allows him to make philosophical questions &quot;storyable&quot;. He enjoys reading explanatory story notes by authors, and includes them in his own collections. He considers these not the &quot;precise response to &#x27;How did you get the idea?,&#x27; but it&#x27;s a way to answer the reader if they knew what the best question to ask [about the story] was&quot;.

==Reception==
Critic John Clute has written that Chiang&#x27;s work has a &quot;tight-hewn and lucid style... [which] has a magnetic effect on the reader&quot;. Critic and poet Joyce Carol Oates wrote that Chiang explores &quot;conventional tropes of science fiction in highly unconventional ways&quot; in &quot;teasing, tormenting, illuminating, thrilling&quot; fashion, comparing him favorably to Philip K. Dick, James Tiptree Jr. and Jorge Luis Borges. Writer Peter Watts has praised Chiang&#x27;s work, writing: &quot;We share a secret prayer, we writers of short SF. We utter it whenever one of our stories is about to appear in public, and it goes like this: &quot;Please, Lord. Please, if it be Thy will, don’t let Ted Chiang publish a story this year.&quot;&quot;

Former US president Barack Obama included Chiang&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Exhalation&quot; in his 2019 reading list, praising it as the &quot;best kind of science fiction&quot;.

Chiang has commented on &quot;metacognition, or thinking about one’s own thinking&quot; being something most humans, but neither animals nor current AI, are capable of, and that capitalism erodes the capacity for this insight, especially for tech company executives.

===Awards===
Chiang has won the following science fiction awards for his works: a Nebula Award for &quot;Tower of Babylon&quot; (1990); the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1992; a Nebula Award and the Theodore Sturgeon Award for &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; (1998); a Sidewise Award for &quot;Seventy-Two Letters&quot; (2000); a Nebula Award, Locus Award, and Hugo Award for his novelette &quot;Hell Is the Absence of God&quot; (2002); a Locus Award for his short story collection &quot;Stories of Your Life and Others&quot; (2003); a Nebula and Hugo Award for his novelette &quot;The Merchant and the Alchemist&#x27;s Gate&quot; (2007); a British Science Fiction Association Award, a Locus Award, and the Hugo Award for Best Short Story for &quot;Exhalation&quot; (2009); a Hugo Award and Locus Award for his novella &quot;The Lifecycle of Software Objects&quot; (2010); a Locus Award for his short story collection &quot;&quot; (2020); and a Locus Award for his novelette &quot;Omphalos&quot; (2020).

Chiang turned down a Hugo nomination for his short story &quot;Liking What You See: A Documentary&quot; in 2003, on the grounds that the story was rushed due to editorial pressure and did not turn out as he had really wanted.

In 2013, his collection of translated stories won the German Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis for best foreign science fiction.

In 2024, Chiang won the PEN/Malamud Award for &quot;excellence in the art of the short story&quot; and the American Humanist Association&#x27;s Inquiry and Innovation Award.

<text>Sweet Charity is a musical with music by Cy Coleman, lyrics by Dorothy Fields and book by Neil Simon. It was directed and choreographed for Broadway by Bob Fosse starring his wife and muse Gwen Verdon alongside John McMartin. It is based on the screenplay for the 1957 Italian film &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot;. However, whereas Federico Fellini&#x27;s black-and-white film concerns the romantic ups-and-downs of an ever-hopeful prostitute, in the musical the central character is a dancer-for-hire at a Times Square dance hall. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1966, where it was nominated for nine Tony Awards, winning the Tony Award for Best Choreography. The production also ran in the West End as well as having revivals and international productions.

The musical was adapted for the screen in 1969 with Shirley MacLaine as Charity and John McMartin recreating his Broadway role as Oscar Lindquist in &quot;Sweet Charity: The Adventures of a Girl Who Wanted to Be Loved&quot;. For Bob Fosse, who directed and choreographed, the film was his feature-film directorial debut.

==Plot==

===Act I===
The young woman Charity Hope Valentine is a taxi dancer at a dance hall called the Fandango Ballroom in New York City. With a shoulder bag and a heart tattooed on her left shoulder, Charity meets her boyfriend Charlie in Central Park. While Charlie silently preens himself, Charity speaks the pick-up lines she imagines him saying, and tells him how handsome he is (&quot;You Should See Yourself&quot;). Charlie then steals her handbag and pushes her into the lake (usually the orchestra pit) before running off. Passers-by discuss the apparent drowning but do nothing, until a young Spaniard finally rescues her. In the Hostess Room of the Fandango Ballroom, Charity tries to convince both herself and the other skeptical taxi dancers that Charlie tried to save her. Nickie, a fellow dancer, tells Charity that “your big problem is you run your heart like a hotel – you got guys checkin’ in and out all the time”. The manager, Herman, arrives to tell them it is time for work. The hostess dancers proposition the audience in the front room of the Fandango Ballroom (&quot;Big Spender&quot;). Helene and Nickie try to comfort Charity about Charlie&#x27;s absence (&quot;Charity&#x27;s Soliloquy&quot;).

On the street, after work, Charity gives to every beggar who approaches her until she realizes she has no money. Just then, film star Vittorio Vidal rushes out of the smart Pompeii Club, in pursuit of his beautiful mistress, Ursula. Ursula refuses to go back inside with Vittorio, who promptly takes the only-too-willing Charity instead. Inside the Pompeii Club, the dancers are dancing the latest craze, The Rich Man&#x27;s Frug. To everyone&#x27;s astonishment, the famous Vittorio is accompanied by the unknown Charity. She tries to steer him away from the subject of Ursula. Finally, he wants to dance. Not having eaten since breakfast, Charity faints. There is general agreement amongst the dancers that she needs to be &quot;laid down&quot;. Vittorio asks &quot;where?&quot;, and Charity recovers enough to prompt Vittorio with &quot;your apartment!&quot;.

Lying down on Vittorio&#x27;s bed, Charity claims she is no longer hungry. She admits she is a dance hall hostess, putting it down to &quot;the fickle finger of fate&quot; (a favorite expression of hers). Vittorio is struck by her humor and honesty. Starstruck, Charity asks for a signed photograph to prove to the girls she was really in his apartment. While Vittorio fetches props from his old movies for further evidence, Charity remarks on her good fortune (&quot;If My Friends Could See Me Now&quot;). Ursula arrives to apologize for her jealousy; Charity is swiftly bundled into a closet before Vittorio opens the door to Ursula. (&quot;Too Many Tomorrows&quot;) While Charity watches from the closet, Vittorio and Ursula make love inside his four-poster bed. The following morning, Charity is escorted from the room by a mortified Vittorio. In the Hostess Room, the girls are disappointed that Charity failed to get more out of Vittorio. Nickie announces she is not going to remain at this job for the rest of her life, prompting the girls to speculate on alternative careers (&quot;There&#x27;s Gotta Be Something Better Than This&quot;), but Herman brings them back down to earth. Charity decides to seek some cultural enlightenment at the 92nd Street Y, where she gets stuck in a broken elevator with shy tax accountant Oscar Lindquist. While trying to calm him down, Charity learns that he is not married. She declares, &quot;Oh Oscar... You&#x27;re gonna be all right.&quot; After helping Oscar overcome his claustrophobia (&quot;I&#x27;m the Bravest Individual&quot;), the pair are plunged into new panic when the lights stop working.

===Act II===
After being trapped in a broken elevator, Oscar and Charity are finally rescued when it starts working again. Oscar invites Charity to go to church with him, to which she hesitantly agrees. As they walk under the Manhattan Bridge to the church, the faint cries of the next person to be stuck in the elevator are heard. The Rhythm of Life Church turns out to be a thin veneer on hippie culture (&quot;The Rhythm of Life&quot;). A police raid breaks up the meeting. Traveling home on the subway, Oscar proposes another date and tries to guess Charity&#x27;s job, deciding that she works in a bank. Charity lies, saying she works for First National City, Williamsburg Branch. As they part, Oscar kisses her hand, and dubs her Sweet Charity (&quot;Sweet Charity&quot;).

After two weeks, Oscar and Charity have continued dating, and she still has not confessed what she actually does for a living. At Coney Island Amusement Park they become trapped again when the Parachute Jump ride breaks. This time, Oscar is the calm one while Charity is scared — scared that she is starting to depend on him. Once again, Charity loses her nerve about telling him what her real job is. As the crowd looks on, the couple kisses. On a slow night at the Fandango, Charity loses the opportunity to snare one of the few customers to a new co-worker, Rosie. Disgusted by the whole business, she quits. However, in Times Square, she wonders what the alternative is (&quot;Where Am I Going?&quot;). Sending a telegram to Oscar, she asks to meet him at Barney&#x27;s Chile Hacienda. She admits that she is a dance hall hostess; he admits he already knows, having followed her one night and watched her dancing. He says he does not care and wants to marry her. Relieved and elated, Charity leaves (&quot;I&#x27;m A Brass Band&quot;) and packs a suitcase on which is printed &#x27;Almost Married&#x27;.

After a farewell party at the Ballroom (&quot;I Love to Cry at Weddings&quot;), Charity and Oscar walk in the park, whereupon Oscar announces that he cannot go through with the wedding, saying he is unable to stop thinking about the &quot;other men&quot;. Eventually, believing he’s sparing her an unhappy life with him, he pushes her into the lake and runs off. Emerging from the lake, Charity, speaking directly to the audience, asks &quot;Did you ever have one of &quot;those&quot; days?&quot;. Realizing that unlike Charlie, Oscar has not stolen her bag, she shrugs and reprises her opening dance.

The stage blacks out onto three neon signs, reading &quot;And so she lived … &quot;hopefully&quot; … ever after&quot;.

==Productions==

===Original productions===
After a tryout at the Shubert Theatre in Philadelphia starting Monday, December 6, 1965, it moved to Detroit&#x27;s Fisher Theatre for a month, and then premiered on Broadway at the Palace Theatre on January 29, 1966, and closed on July 15, 1967, after 608 performances and 10 previews. It was conceived, directed, and choreographed by Bob Fosse, who wrote the original libretto under the pen-name &quot;Bert Lewis&quot;, from Robert Louis Fosse. The show starred Gwen Verdon, John McMartin, Helen Gallagher, Thelma Oliver, James Luisi, Arnold Soboloff, Sharon Ritchie, Ruth Buzzi, and Barbara Sharma. Scenic and lighting design were by Robert Randolph and costume design was by Irene Sharaff. The production was nominated for 9 Tony Awards, winning for Fosse&#x27;s choreography.

The Australian production was produced by J.C. Williamson, starring Nancye Hayes as Charity and Peter Adams as Oscar. The show commenced on 21 January 1967 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Sydney, and subsequently played seasons in Melbourne and Adelaide.

The musical opened in the West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre in October 1967, running for 476 performances. Juliet Prowse starred, and was succeeded by Gretchen Wyler.

===1986 Broadway revival===
A revival opened on Broadway at the Minskoff Theatre on April 27, 1986 and closed on March 15, 1987, running for 369 performances and 15 previews. Again directed and choreographed by Fosse, Debbie Allen starred as Charity with Bebe Neuwirth as Nickie, Allison Williams as Helene and Michael Rupert as Oscar. Fosse&#x27;s wife Gwen Verdon (the original Charity from 1966), remounted the choreography with Fosse, and taught many of the ensemble numbers to the female chorus. The production won four Tony Awards including the Tony Award, Best Reproduction (Play or Musical). When Allen left the show, Ann Reinking took over as Charity.

Audience-attended previews began February 8, with the Opening Night performance held February 17, 2005. The Minneapolis engagement closed on February 20. Applegate broke her foot in Chicago, the second stop on the tour, and was replaced by her understudy, Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise. Then, after the final leg of the tour in Boston, the producers announced that the production would not be continuing to Broadway due to lack of interest. However, two days later, the Broadway engagement was on after Applegate convinced the producers to continue. A week into previews, Applegate rejoined the cast, which also included Denis O&#x27;Hare as Oscar, Shannon Lewis as Ursula and Ernie Sabella as Herman. The show was nominated for three Tony Awards including Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical for Applegate.

<text>In database systems, isolation is one of the ACID (&quot;Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability&quot;) transaction properties. It determines how transaction integrity is visible to other users and systems. A lower isolation level increases the ability of many users to access the same data at the same time, but also increases the number of concurrency effects (such as dirty reads or lost updates) users might encounter. Conversely, a higher isolation level reduces the types of concurrency effects that users may encounter, but requires more system resources and increases the chances that one transaction will block another.

==DBMS Concurrency Control==
Concurrency control comprises the underlying mechanisms in a DBMS which handle isolation and guarantee related correctness. It is heavily used by the database and storage engines both to guarantee the correct execution of concurrent transactions, and (via different mechanisms) the correctness of other DBMS processes. The transaction-related mechanisms typically constrain the database data access operations&#x27; timing (transaction schedules) to certain orders characterized as the serializability and recoverability schedule properties. Constraining database access operation execution typically means reduced performance (measured by rates of execution), and thus concurrency control mechanisms are typically designed to provide the best performance possible under the constraints. Often, when possible without harming correctness, the serializability property is compromised for better performance. However, recoverability cannot be compromised, since such typically results in a database integrity violation.

Two-phase locking is the most common transaction concurrency control method in DBMSs, used to provide both serializability and recoverability for correctness. In order to access a database object a transaction first needs to acquire a lock for this object. Depending on the access operation type (e.g., reading or writing an object) and on the lock type, acquiring the lock may be blocked and postponed, if another transaction is holding a lock for that object.

==Client Side Isolation==
Isolation is typically enforced at the database level. However, various client-side systems can also be used. It can be controlled in application frameworks or runtime containers such as J2EE Entity Beans On older systems, it may be implemented systemically (by the application developers), for example through the use of temporary tables. In two-tier, three-tier, or n-tier web applications a transaction manager can be used to maintain isolation. A transaction manager is middleware which sits between an app service (back-end application service) and the operating system. A transaction manager can provide global isolation and atomicity. It tracks when new servers join a transaction and coordinates an atomic commit protocol among the servers. The details are abstracted from the app, making transactions simpler and easier to code. A transaction processing monitor (TPM) is a collection of middle-ware including a transaction manager. A TPM might provide local isolation to an app with a lock manager.

==Read Phenomena==
The ANSI/ISO standard SQL 92 refers to three different &quot;read phenomena&quot; when a transaction retrieves data that another transaction might have updated.

In the following examples, two transactions take place. In transaction 1, a query is performed, then in transaction 2, an update is performed, and finally in transaction 1, the same query is performed again.

The examples use the following relation:

===Dirty reads===
A &quot;dirty read&quot; (aka &quot;uncommitted dependency&quot;) occurs when a transaction retrieves a row that has been updated by another transaction that is not yet committed.

In this example, transaction 1 retrieves the row with id 1, then transaction 2 updates the row with id 1, and finally transaction 1 retrieves the row with id 1 again. Now if transaction 2 rolls back its update (already retrieved by transaction 1) or performs other updates, then the view of the row may be wrong in transaction 1. At the READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level, the second SELECT in transaction 1 retrieves the updated row: this is a dirty read. At the READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE isolation levels, the second SELECT in transaction 1 retrieves the initial row.

===Non-repeatable reads===
A &quot;non-repeatable read&quot; occurs when a transaction retrieves a row twice and that row is updated by another transaction that is committed in between.

In this example, transaction 1 retrieves the row with id 1, then transaction 2 updates the row with id 1 and is committed, and finally transaction 1 retrieves the row with id 1 again. At the READ UNCOMMITTED and READ COMMITTED isolation levels, the second SELECT in transaction 1 retrieves the updated row: this is a non-repeatable read. At the REPEATABLE READ and SERIALIZABLE isolation levels, the second SELECT in transaction 1 retrieves the initial row.

===Phantom reads===
A &quot;phantom read&quot; occurs when a transaction retrieves a set of rows twice and new rows are inserted into or removed from that set by another transaction that is committed in between.

In this example, transaction 1 retrieves the set of rows with age greater than 17, then transaction 2 inserts a row with age 26 and is committed, and finally transaction 1 retrieves the set of rows with age greater than 17 again. At the READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, and REPEATABLE READ isolation levels, the second SELECT in transaction 1 retrieves the new set of rows that includes the inserted row: this is a phantom read. At the SERIALIZABLE isolation level, the second SELECT in transaction 1 retrieves the initial set of rows.

There are two basic strategies used to prevent non-repeatable reads and phantom reads. In the first strategy, &quot;lock-based concurrency control&quot;, transaction 2 is committed after transaction 1 is committed or rolled back. It produces the serial schedule &quot;T1, T2&quot;. In the other strategy, &quot;multiversion concurrency control&quot;, transaction 2 is committed immediately while transaction 1, which started before transaction 2, continues to operate on an old snapshot of the database taken at the start of transaction 1, and when transaction 1 eventually tries to commit, if the result of committing would be equivalent to the serial schedule &quot;T1, T2&quot;, then transaction 1 is committed; otherwise, there is a commit conflict and transaction 1 is rolled back with a serialization failure.

Under lock-based concurrency control, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads may occur when read locks are not acquired when performing a SELECT, or when the acquired locks on affected rows are released as soon as the SELECT is performed. Under multiversion concurrency control, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads may occur when the requirement that a transaction affected by a commit conflict must be rolled back is relaxed.

==Isolation levels==
Of the four ACID properties in a DBMS (Database Management System), the isolation property is the one most often relaxed. When attempting to maintain the highest level of isolation, a DBMS usually acquires locks on data which may result in a loss of concurrency, or implements multiversion concurrency control. This requires adding logic for the application to function correctly.

Most DBMSs offer a number of &quot;transaction isolation levels&quot;, which control the degree of locking that occurs when selecting data. For many database applications, the majority of database transactions can be constructed to avoid requiring high isolation levels (e.g. SERIALIZABLE level), thus reducing the locking overhead for the system. The programmer must carefully analyze database access code to ensure that any relaxation of isolation does not cause software bugs that are difficult to find. Conversely, if higher isolation levels are used, the possibility of deadlock is increased, which also requires careful analysis and programming techniques to avoid.

Since each isolation level is stronger than those below, in that no higher isolation level allows an action forbidden by a lower one, the standard permits a DBMS to run a transaction at an isolation level stronger than that requested (e.g., a &quot;Read committed&quot; transaction may actually be performed at a &quot;Repeatable read&quot; isolation level).

The isolation levels defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL standard are listed as follows.

===Serializable===
This is the &quot;highest&quot; isolation level.

With a lock-based concurrency control DBMS implementation, serializability requires read and write locks (acquired on selected data) to be released at the end of the transaction. Also &quot;range-locks&quot; must be acquired when a SELECT query uses a ranged &quot;WHERE&quot; clause, especially to avoid the phantom reads phenomenon.

When using non-lock based concurrency control, no locks are acquired; however, if the system detects a &quot;write collision&quot; among several concurrent transactions, only one of them is allowed to commit. See &quot;snapshot isolation&quot; for more details on this topic.

From : (Second Informal Review Draft) ISO/IEC 9075:1992, Database Language SQL- July 30, 1992:
&quot;The execution of concurrent SQL-transactions at isolation level SERIALIZABLE is guaranteed to be serializable. A serializable execution is defined to be an execution of the operations of concurrently executing SQL-transactions that produces the same effect as some serial execution of those same SQL-transactions. A serial execution is one in which each SQL-transaction executes to completion before the next SQL-transaction begins.&quot;

===Repeatable reads===
In this isolation level, a lock-based concurrency control DBMS implementation keeps read and write locks (acquired on selected data) until the end of the transaction. However, &quot;range-locks&quot; are not managed, so phantom reads can occur.

Write skew is possible at this isolation level in some systems. Write skew is a phenomenon where two writes are allowed to the same column(s) in a table by two different writers (who have previously read the columns they are updating), resulting in the column having data that is a mix of the two transactions.

===Read committed===
In this isolation level, a lock-based concurrency control DBMS implementation keeps write locks (acquired on selected data) until the end of the transaction, but read locks are released as soon as the SELECT operation is performed (so the non-repeatable reads phenomenon can occur in this isolation level). As in the previous level, &quot;range-locks&quot; are not managed.

Putting it in simpler words, read committed is an isolation level that guarantees that any data read is committed at the moment it is read. It simply restricts the reader from seeing any intermediate, uncommitted, &#x27;dirty&#x27; read. It makes no promise whatsoever that if the transaction re-issues the read, it will find the same data; data is free to change after it is read.

===Read uncommitted===
This is the &quot;lowest&quot; isolation level. In this level, dirty reads are allowed, so one transaction may see &quot;not-yet-committed&quot; changes made by other transactions.

==Default isolation level==
The &quot;default isolation level&quot; of different DBMS&#x27;s varies quite widely. Most databases that feature transactions allow the user to set any isolation level. Some DBMS&#x27;s also require additional syntax when performing a SELECT statement to acquire locks (e.g. &quot;SELECT … FOR UPDATE&quot; to acquire exclusive write locks on accessed rows).

However, the definitions above have been criticized as being ambiguous, and as not accurately reflecting the isolation provided by many databases:

:This paper shows a number of weaknesses in the anomaly approach to defining isolation levels. The three ANSI phenomena are ambiguous, and even in their loosest interpretations do not exclude some anomalous behavior … This leads to some counter-intuitive results. In particular, lock-based isolation levels have different characteristics than their ANSI equivalents. This is disconcerting because commercial database systems typically use locking implementations. Additionally, the ANSI phenomena do not distinguish between a number of types of isolation level behavior that are popular in commercial systems.

There are also other criticisms concerning ANSI SQL&#x27;s isolation definition, in that it encourages implementors to do &quot;bad things&quot;:

:... it relies in subtle ways on an assumption that a locking schema is used for concurrency control, as opposed to an optimistic or multi-version concurrency scheme. This implies that the proposed semantics are &quot;ill-defined&quot;.

==Isolation levels vs read phenomena==

Anomaly serializable is not the same as serializable. That is, it is necessary, but not sufficient that a serializable schedule should be free of all three phenomena types.

<text>The Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis (German for &quot;Lower Silesian district of Upper Lusatia&quot;) was the easternmost &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) of both Saxony and Germany. Neighboring districts were (from south clockwise) Löbau-Zittau, Bautzen, Kamenz and the district Spree-Neiße in Brandenburg. The urban district Görlitz was in the east, at the border to Poland.

== History ==
The territory of this district was not part of Saxony before World War II; rather, it was a part of German Silesia, along with the city of Görlitz. When most of Silesia was assigned to Poland after the war, the tiny rump of the Silesian province was integrated into Saxony.

The current district was formed in 1994 by merging the previous districts Niesky and Weißwasser, and most part of the former district Görlitz. In August 2008, it became a part of the new district of Görlitz.

== Geography ==
The main river in the district is the Neisse, which also forms the boundary to Poland. The terrain is mostly hilly, with broad valleys. In the past many swamps covered the area, which is now heath areas and many ponds.

<text>Blackburn () is an industrial town and the administrative centre of the Blackburn with Darwen borough in Lancashire, England. The town is north of the West Pennine Moors on the southern edge of the Ribble Valley, east of Preston and north-northwest of Manchester. Blackburn is the core centre of the wider unitary authority area along with the town of Darwen. It is the second largest town (after Blackpool) in Lancashire. 

At the 2011 census, Blackburn had a population of 117,963, whilst the wider borough of Blackburn with Darwen had a population of 150,030. Blackburn had a population of 117,963 in 2011, with 30.8% being people of ethnic backgrounds other than white British.

A former mill town, textiles have been produced in Blackburn since the middle of the 13th century, when wool was woven in people&#x27;s houses in the domestic system. Flemish weavers who settled in the area in the 14th century helped to develop the woollen cottage industry. The most rapid period of growth and development in Blackburn&#x27;s history coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of textile manufacturing.

Blackburn&#x27;s textile sector fell into decline from the mid-20th century and subsequently faced similar challenges to other post-industrial northern towns, including deindustrialisation, economic deprivation and housing problems. Blackburn has had significant investment and redevelopment since 1958 through government funding and the European Regional Development Fund.

==History==
===Toponymy===

The origins of the name are uncertain. It has been suggested that it may be a combination of the River Blakewater, and an Old English word &quot;burn&quot;, meaning stream. Local author William Abram, in his 1877 history of the town and parish, cited the ancient name as &quot;Blake Burne&quot;. Abram also confirms that the region, later known as the Blackburn Hundred, was known as &quot;Blakeburneshyre&quot;. Blackburn was recorded in Domesday Book (1086) as &quot;Blacheburne&quot; and &quot;Blacheburn&quot;. By the time of John Speed&#x27;s map of 1610, the spelling of the town was &quot;Blackburn&quot;, while the region was &quot;Blackburne&quot;. There is anecdotal speculation that the name of the town may simply mean &quot;black burn&quot;, or &quot;black stream&quot;.

===Prehistory===
There is little evidence of prehistoric settlement in the Blakewater valley, in which Blackburn developed. Evidence of activity in the form of two urn burials has been discovered from the Bronze Age in the hills around Blackburn. In 1879, a cinerary urn was discovered at a tumulus at Revidge, north of the town; another was excavated in 1996 at Pleasington Cemetery, west of the town, by gravedigger Grant Higson. The presence of a sacred spring—perhaps in use during the Iron Age—provides evidence of prehistoric activity in the town centre, at All Hallows Spring on Railway Road.

===Roman era===
Blackburn is located where a Roman military road crossed the river Blakewater. The road linked Bremetennacum Veteranorum (Ribchester) and Mamucium (a major Roman fort that occupied Castlefield in Manchester). The route of the road passed east of Blackburn Cathedral and probably crossed the river in the Salford neighbourhood just east of the modern town centre. It is not clear whether the road predated the settlement.

George C. Miller, in his &quot;Blackburn: The Evolution of a Cotton Town&quot;, says:

The ancient military way from Mamucium (Manchester) to (Bremetennacum) (Ribchester), passing over Blacksnape, plunges on its unswerving course through Blackamoor, over the scarp at Whinney Heights, to pass across the Blakewater in the vicinity of Salford. This fact alone presents a reasonable argument for the existence of a British oppidum or walled village on the site, it being customary for such primitive communities to cluster in the vicinity of a ford or bridge.

According to William Abram (1877):

The Parish of Blackburn contains many interesting vestiges. Three of the four principal roads constructed by the Romans in Lancashire traversed some portion of the Parish : —I. The lower road from the south to Carlisle, intersected the township of Walton-in-le-Dale. 2. The road from Manchester to Overborough crossed the Parish at its broadest part. 3. The road from the sea to the interior, which formed the conmiunication between the &quot;Sistuntian Port&quot; (on the Wyre) and Ribchester, Ilkley-in-Wharfedale, Aldborough andYork, enters Blackburn Parish at Ribchester, by a ford over the Ribble. The late Rev. E. Sibson, in a paper on the Roman Roads of the Wigan district, speaks of a road of this kind which branched off eastward from Blackrod, &quot;Street-fold and Water-street, near Rivington, and by White Hough, in Tockholes, to the small Roman station at Blackburn, near the new road to Preston.&quot;

====Roman temple spring at All Hallows====
All Hallows Spring was excavated by Antiquarians in 1654 and found to contain an inscribed stone commemorating the dedication of a temple to Serapis by Claudius Hieronymus, legate of Legio VI Victrix.

===Middle Ages===

Christianity is believed to have come to Blackburn by the end of the 6th century, in either 596 (as there is a record of a &quot;church of Blagbourne&quot; in that year) or 598 AD. The town was important during the Anglo-Saxon era when the Blackburnshire Hundred came into existence as a territorial division of the kingdom of Northumbria.

The name of the town appears in the Domesday Book as both &quot;Blacheburne&quot; and &quot;Blacheburn&quot;, a royal manor during the days of Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. Archaeological evidence from the demolition of the medieval parish church on the site of the cathedral in 1820 suggests that a church was built during the late 11th or early 12th century. A market cross was also erected nearby in 1101. The manor came into the possession of Henry de Blackburn, who divided it between his two sons. Later, one half was granted to the monks of Stanlow Abbey and this moiety was subsequently granted to the monks of Whalley Abbey. During the 12th century, the town&#x27;s importance declined as Clitheroe became the regional centre. In addition to a settlement in the town centre area, there were several other medieval domiciles nearby.

===Industrial Revolution and textiles===
Textile manufacturing in Blackburn dates from the mid-13th century, when wool produced locally by farmers was woven in their homes. Flemish weavers who settled in the area in the 14th century developed the industry. By 1650 the town was known for the manufacture of blue and white &quot;Blackburn checks&quot;, and &quot;Blackburn greys&quot; became famous not long afterwards. By the first half of the 18th century textile manufacture had become Blackburn&#x27;s main industry. From the mid-18th to the early 20th century Blackburn evolved from a small market town into &quot;the weaving capital of the world&quot;, and its population increased from less than 5,000 to over 130,000.

&quot;John Bartholomew&#x27;s Gazetteer of the British Isles&quot; provides a profile of Blackburn in 1887:

Blackburn. parl. and mun. bor., parish and township, NE. Lancashire, E. of Preston and NW. of London by rail – par., 48,281 ac., pop. 161,617; township, 3681 ac., pop. 91,958; bor., 6974 ac., pop. 104,014; 4 Banks, 2 newspapers. Market-days, Wednesday and Saturday. It is one of the chief seats of cotton manufacture, besides producing calico, muslin, &amp;c., there being over 140 mills at work. There are also factories for making cotton machinery and steam-engines. Blackburn has been associated with many improvements in the manufacture of cotton, among which was the invention (1767) of the &quot;spinning jenny&quot; which was invented in nearby Oswaldtwistle by James Hargreaves, who died in 1770. There are several fine churches and public buildings. A Corporation Park (50 ac. in area) is on the outskirts of the town. Several lines of railway converge here, and pass through one principal station belonging to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Ry. Co. B. returns 2 members to Parliament.

From around 1750, cotton textile manufacturing expanded rapidly. Supplied with cotton by merchants, and paid by the piece, cottagers spun cotton into thread and wove it into cloth. The merchants arranged for cloth to be bleached and dyed.

After 1775, spinning mills were built in the town. Early mills were warehouse conversions; the first purpose-built spinning mill was constructed in 1797 and by 1824 there were 24. The number of spindles reached 2.5 million  by 1870 and spinning mills were constructed up to that time – 24 since 1850. Spinning declined between 1870 and 1900 as the sector transferred to south Lancashire.

In 18th-century Blackburn, weaving was primarily undertaken by handloom weavers working from their own cottages. However, as powerlooms were introduced into the mills after 1825, the percentage of handloom weavers began to decline and this occurred more rapidly in areas closer to the town. In 1826 the Power-loom riots cam through Blackburn in response to the loss of jobs and low wages. Handloom weavers continued to make up a sizable portion of the workforce in outlying rural areas. The last handloom shop in Blackburn closed in 1894.

===1800s===
In 1807, the Daniel Thwaites &amp; Co brewery was established; the company is still in business today and is now based at Sykes Holt in Mellor.

Improvements to the power loom in the early 1840s, and the construction of a railway line in 1846, led to greater investment in power looms in Blackburn in the second half of that decade. The railway brought opportunities for expansion of the cotton trade, and in subsequent decades many new mills were constructed: between 1850 and 1870, sixty-eight weaving-only and four combined weaving/spinning mills were built and nine weaving mills were built per decade between 1870 and 1890.
Improvements in power loom efficiency meant that weaving, the primary source of wealth and income for handloom weavers, began to transfer from the cottage industry to factories. This led to high rates of unemployment: according to figures published in March 1826, some 60 per cent of all handloom weavers in Blackburn and Rishton, Lower Darwen and Oswaldtwistle were unemployed. High unemployment led to the Lancashire weavers&#x27; riots. At 3:00 pm on 24 April 1826, a mob arrived in Blackburn after attacking power looms in Accrington. Proceeding to Bannister Eccles&#x27; Jubilee Factory on Jubilee Street, the mob destroyed 212 power looms in the space of 35 minutes. They then turned their attention to John Houghton and Sons&#x27; Park Place factory, located nearby, and destroyed another 25 looms, before seeking more machinery to attack. The crowd began to disperse at around 6:00 pm, troops having arrived at 3:30 pm to try to quell the rioting.

===20th-century decline of the cotton industry===
In 1890, Blackburn&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce had recognised that the town was overly dependent on the cotton industry, warning of the dangers of &quot;only having one string to their bow in Blackburn&quot;. The warning proved prophetic when, in 1904, a slump hit the cotton industry and other industries dependent on it, such as engineering, brewing and building. In 1908, another slump saw 43 mills stop production and a quarter of the town&#x27;s looms lay idle. 
During the First World War suspension of trade with India resulted in the expansion of colonial British India&#x27;s cotton industry at the expense of Britain&#x27;s, and the imposition of an 11 per cent import tariff by the colonial British Government led to a dramatic slump in trade in 1921, a situation which worsened in 1922 after the Indian Government raised the tariff to 14 per cent. This caused the number of stopped mills to increase to 47, with 43,000 looms lying idle. Two years into the slump, Foundry and Limbrick Mills became the first to close permanently.

Not long afterwards, in 1926, the General Strike saw production suspended at half the town&#x27;s mills and 12,000 unemployed.

In 1927, Matthew Brown &amp; Co. relocated to the town&#x27;s Lion Brewery, on Coniston Road, following their acquisition of local brewer Nuttall &amp; Co, later the subject of a hostile takeover by Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries in 1987, ceasing brewing in 1991.

In 1928, there was another slump in textile production, and another strike in 1929 after employers requested a 12% wage cut; 40,000 cotton workers struck for a week and eight mills closed, making 28 closures in six years. By the start of 1930, 50 mills had shut and 21,000 people were unemployed. A financial crisis in 1931 led to 24,000 unemployed, with 1,000 houses and 166 shops lying empty in the town. A total of 26 mills closed down between 1930 and 1934.

====1948 mass fingerprinting====
Blackburn became the first town to undertake the mass fingerprinting of people following the murder of June Anne Devaney in May 1948. June Anne Devaney was a three-year-old patient at Queens Park Hospital when she was abducted from her cot and murdered in the hospital grounds on 15 May 1948. Fingerprints on a bottle underneath her cot led the police to fingerprint every male over the age of 16 who was present in Blackburn on 14 and 15 May 1948. After taking over 46,500 sets of fingerprints, a match was made with Peter Griffiths, a 22-year-old ex-serviceman. Griffiths admitted his guilt and his trial ascertained if he was sane or not. After deliberating for 23 minutes, the jury found him sane and he was hanged at Liverpool Prison on Friday 19 November 1948. After his conviction, the police destroyed all fingerprints they had taken.

====1948–1999====
Between 1948 and 1950 the textile industry experienced a short post-war boom, during which sales increased, industry training methods improved and automatic looms were introduced, which allowed a single weaver to control 20 to 25 looms. Loom sheds were rebuilt to house new, larger looms. Despite the post-war boom, the cotton industry continued to decline and only 25 per cent of the town&#x27;s population were employed in textiles by 1951; this figure had stood at 60 per cent up to the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929. In 1952 the number of weavers fell from 10,890 to 9,020. By 1955 more cloth was imported from India than was exported and between 1955 and 1958 another 16 mills closed. In 1959, due partly to the re-organisation of the textile industry as a result of the Textiles Act, another 17 mills closed. By 1960 there were 30 mills operating in Blackburn.

Closures continued in the 1960s with The Parkside, Fountains, Malvern and Pioneer Mills shutting in 1964. In 1967 the Eclipse Mill at Feniscowles closed, unable to compete with imported cloth sold at nine pence cheaper per yard than the mill could produce. By the end of that year there were 26 mills operating. The 1970s saw further closures, and the number of textile workers in Blackburn reduced to 6,000 by January 1975, the year in which the Albion and Alston mills stopped production with the loss of 400 jobs. In 1976 there were 2,100 looms in operation in the town, compared with 79,405 in 1907.

===21st-century revitalisation===

After continued economic decline in the 2000s, new investment began in the 2010s. In 2015, Scottish designer Patrick Grant rescued Cookson &amp; Clegg, a factory founded in Blackburn in 1860 that was facing closure. The following year he launched the Blackburn-based clothing brand Community Clothing to boost employment in British mills and factories.

The inaugural British Textile Biennial, a month-long festival celebrating textiles through art and exhibitions, was held in Blackburn in 2019. The second edition took place in October 2021, and included an exhibition from Turner Prize winner Lubaina Himid and a film starring Maxine Peake.

In 2021, the Blackburn with Darwen Council proposed a £250m &quot;Blackburn Master Plan&quot; to revitalise central Blackburn over the next decade, with the goal of building 500 new homes and creating 1,000 jobs. In 2022, £200m in government, council, and private investments were announced for the revitalisations of the town centres in both Blackburn and Darwen. The Townscape Heritage Project will create a new cultural quarter in Blackburn&#x27;s historic town centre. Councillor Phil Riley stated that additional investment over the next decade could lead to 100,000 jobs in the borough.
==Governance==

Blackburn is administered by Blackburn with Darwen unitary authority, which encompasses Blackburn and the small town of Darwen to the south. The town sends one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons.

===Local government===

The council has been elected &quot;by thirds&quot; since 1996 In its 2007 Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA), the Audit Commission described the council as &quot;improving well&quot; and gave it the highest &quot;four star&quot; overall performance rating.

Although children&#x27;s services, adult social care and GCSE results were praised, the commission highlighted &quot;significant health problems&quot; and increased &quot;levels of repeat victims of domestic violence&quot; as causes for concern. Despite generally good performance, overall user satisfaction levels with the council are below average and not improving. The borough has Beacon Council status and shares its best practice in education policy with other councils as part of the scheme.

===Parliamentary representation===
The historic constituency of Blackburn was created for the 1832 general election and sent two Members of Parliament (MPs) to Westminster until it was abolished in 1950 and replaced for one parliamentary term by two new single-member constituencies, Blackburn East and Blackburn West. At the 1955 general election, Blackburn East and Blackburn West were merged into the modern-day constituency which is relatively tightly formed and returns a single MP.

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms of the former Blackburn Borough Council has many distinctive emblems. The blazon of the arms is: &quot;Argent a Fesse wavy Sable between three Bees volant proper on a Chief Vert a Bugle stringed Argent between two Fusils Or. On the crest, a Wreath of the Colours a Shuttle Or thereon a Dove wings elevated Argent and holding in the beak the Thread of the Shuttle reflexed over the back and an Olive Branch proper.&quot; The Latin motto of the town is , correctly translated as &#x27;By art and by labour&#x27; but often translated as &#x27;By skill and hard work&#x27;.

The motto, granted on 14 February 1852 to the former Borough of Blackburn, is poignant, as Blackburn, once a small town, had risen to importance through the energy and enterprise of her spinners and manufacturers, combined with the skill and labour of her operatives. The Borough of Blackburn was formed by the amalgamation of the County Borough of Blackburn, the Borough of Darwen, part of the Turton Urban District and the parishes of Yate and Pickup Bank, Eccleshill, Livesey, Pleasington and Tockholes from the Blackburn Rural District.

==Politics==

Blackburn council and its successor have been predominantly controlled by the Labour Party since 1945 and continuously for 19 years until May 2007 when it fell into no overall control. In 2008, UKPollingReport characterised the constituency of Blackburn as &quot;a mix of deprived inner-city wards dominated by Muslim voters, white working class areas and Conservative voting suburbs&quot;. 

Until 2015, the MP was the former Secretary of State for Justice and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. The distribution of seats as of May 2018 was 44 seats for the Labour Party, 17 for the Conservatives and 3 for the Liberal Democrats.

In July 1992, white and Asian youths rioted for several nights in Blackburn, as a newsagents in Brookhouse was set on fire and police had to disperse &quot;small groups of white youths attempting to join a confrontation between the town&#x27;s ethnic minorities&quot;.

The next resurgence of support for the far right came in 2002; The incumbent Liberal Democrats were pushed into third place behind Labour. Commenting on the elections, Blackburn MP Jack Straw said: &quot;It is very sad. We had the far right in Blackburn 26 years ago when they won two seats in Shadsworth. But there the whole community decided they wouldn&#x27;t have it. You can never say they won&#x27;t put candidates in Blackburn but we will work hard on community relations.&quot;

The council until prior to 2008 had two members for the England First party, Mark Cotterill for Meadowhead ward and Michael Johnson for Fernhurst. Mark Cotterill has since stood down and Michael Johnson joined the For Darwen party. Members of the BNP won a council seat in the town in November 2002 following elections in May which saw three of their colleagues elected in nearby Burnley. The BNP&#x27;s Robin Evans secured a 16-vote majority in Mill Hill ward with two recounts following a campaign using pub meetings and leafleting. Robin Evans resigned from the party in October 2003.

==Geography==
At (53.7449°, −2.4769°), and north-northwest of London, Blackburn stands above sea level, east of Preston and north-northeast of Manchester. The Ribble Valley and West Pennine Moors lie to the north and south respectively. Blackburn experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year.

Although the city of Preston, the administrative centre for Lancashire, is located about west, Blackburn is the largest municipality in East Lancashire. The town is bounded on other sides by the towns of Accrington to the east and Darwen to the south. The village of Wilpshire is north of Blackburn, and is partly (development-touching) however in the Ribble Valley local government district. Other nearby villages are Langho, approximately northeast, and Mellor to the northwest.

The towns of Rishton, to the east, and Great Harwood, to the northeast, are both in the local government district of Hyndburn. The town of Burnley lies to the east.

===Geology and terrain===

 Located in the midst of the East Lancashire Hills, some areas of the town are characterised by steep slopes. The town centre centres in a plain of above sea level surrounded by hills. The Revidge to the north can be reached via a steep climb up Montague Street and Dukes Brow to reach a peak of above sea level.

To the west, the wooded Billinge Hill in Witton Country Park is high, while Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital is situated to the east of the town at a vantage point of . These figures can be considered in the context of other hills and mountains in Lancashire, including Great Hill at , Winter Hill at , Pendle Hill at and Green Hill at .

The River Blakewater, which gives its names to the town, flows down from the moors above Guide and then through the areas of Whitebirk, Little Harwood, Cob Wall and Brookhouse to the town centre. The river is culverted and runs underground in the town centre, under Ainsworth Street and between Blackburn Cathedral and the Boulevard. On the western side of the town centre the Blakewater continues through the Wensley Fold area before joining the River Darwen outside Witton Country Park; the Darwen flows into the River Ribble at Walton-le-Dale.

The geology of the Blackburn area yields numerous resources which underpinned its development as a centre of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution. Mineable coal seams have been used since the mid-late 16th century. 

The Coal Measures in the area overlie the Millstone Grit which has been quarried in the past for millstones and, along with local limestone deposits, used as a construction material for roads and buildings. In addition, there were deposits of iron ore in the Furness and Ulverston districts.

The Blackburn area was subjected to glaciation during the Pleistocene ice age, and the sandstone-and-shale bedrock is overlain in much of the area by glacial deposits called till (which is also called &quot;boulder clay&quot;) of varying thickness up to several tens of feet. Glacial outwash (sand and gravel) also occur in small patches, including along Grimshaw Brook.

===Green belt===

Blackburn is within a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, and is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the nearby Greater Manchester and Merseyside conurbations from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

Sizeable areas of green belt exist within the borough, west and south of Blackburn surrounding Witton Country Park and Pleasington parish, with other parishes in the borough containing portions of green belt, Tockholes, Eccleshill, Yate and Pickup Bank parish, Livesy, Darwen, with North Turton largely covered. The green belt was first drawn up in 1982 under Lancashire County Council, and the size in the borough in 2017 amounted to some .

==Demography==
At the time of the UK Government&#x27;s 2001 census, Blackburn, defined as an urban area, had a population of 105,085 and a population density of . According to further statistics from the same census, this time defining Blackburn as a Westminster parliamentary constituency, the population was 69.22 per cent White British (national average for England 89.99 per cent) with significant Pakistani (14.31 per cent) and Indian (11.45 per cent ) ethnic minorities. 12.33 per cent of the population was born outside the European Union. In terms of religion, 57.53 per cent of residents were Christian (average for England 71.74 per cent), 25.74 per cent Muslim (average for England 3.1 per cent) and 15.98% no religion or not stated.

With regard to the economic activity of those aged 16–74, the 2001 Census indicates that 33.93 per cent were full-time employees (average for England 40.81 per cent), 11.72 per cent part-timers, 5.97 per cent self-employed (average for England 8.32 per cent), and 4.5 per cent unemployed (average for England 3.35 per cent).

The 2001 census also records the social grade of the constituency&#x27;s 72,418 people aged 16 and over: using the NRS social grades system, 10,748 were classed as AB (higher and intermediate managerial/administrative/professional), 17,514 as C1 (supervisory, clerical, junior managerial/administrative/professional), 11,691 as C2 (skilled manual workers), 19,212 as D (semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers), and 13,253 as E (on state benefit, unemployed, lowest grade workers).

Additionally, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council manages a site for gypsies and travellers in the Ewood area of the town.

In the 2021 census, the population of Blackburn with Darwen was 154,922, according to mid-2021 population figures published by the ONS. Blackburn with Darwen&#x27;s population growth rate between mid-2020 and mid-2021 was 0.2% per year. Blackburn with Darwen covers an area of 137 square kilometres (53 square miles) and has a population density of 1,131 people per square kilometre (km2), based on the latest population estimates taken in mid-2021. 

According to the latest 2021 census, the population in Blackburn with Darwen is predominantly white (60%), with non-white minorities representing the remaining 40% of the population. The largest religious group in Blackburn with Darwen is Christians who account for 38% of the population. 

English is spoken as the main language by 87.5% of people in Blackburn with Darwen, and spoken either well or very well by 8% of the population. 3.4% reported having poor English language skills, and the remaining 0.8% spoke no English at all.

=== Ethnicity ===
==Economy==
As of 2007, the town centre was subject to a multimillion-pound investment. Blackburn with Darwen Council made some refurbishments and renovations of key public places, notably the Church Street area with its Grade II listed classical style Waterloo Pavilions complemented by street furniture and sculptures. As of 2006, The Mall Blackburn (formerly known as Blackburn Shopping Centre) was the main shopping centre in Blackburn with over 130 shops and 400 further outlets close by. 

In June 2011, Blackburn Market opened in a new site under the shopping centre and opened six days a week (Monday–Saturday). The previous market was based on the other side of Ainsworth Street. It first opened on this site in 1964, where there was a three-day market (Wednesday, Friday and Saturday) and the Market Hall (Monday–Saturday).

In May 2008, one of the town&#x27;s most well-known shops, the shoe store Tommy Ball&#x27;s, closed due to insolvency. The town&#x27;s oldest store, Mercer &amp; Sons, also closed after a decline in sales blamed on the credit crunch. It opened in 1840 and was originally an ironmonger, but it converted to selling toys, household goods and hardware. In January 2009 the directors of the company announced that the shop would close after a 30-day statutory consultation, unless they changed their minds or a buyer was found.

Markets continue to offer a wide range of local produce, such as Lancashire cheeses, tripe, Bowland beef and lamb. Walsh&#x27;s Sarsaparilla stall decided not to join the move into the Mall shopping centre in 2011, and opens six days a week.

Major employers in Blackburn include: Blackburn College, Thwaites Brewery, BAE Systems (Samlesbury Aerodrome site, located at Samlesbury, northwest of Blackburn); Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council; and the East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust (based at the Royal Blackburn Hospital).

&quot;Drumstone Trade Park&quot; near the town centre has trade outlets.

==Transport==

===Railway===

Blackburn railway station is sited in the town centre and is managed by Northern Trains, who also operate all of its passenger services. It is on the Ribble Valley line between Clitheroe and Manchester Victoria; trains to Manchester typically take around 50 minutes and continue on to Rochdale. The station also hosts East Lancashire Line services eastwards to Burnley, Colne, Leeds and York; services westwards go to Preston and Blackpool.

===Buses===
Blackburn&#x27;s new bus station in Ainsworth Street opened in May 2016. A new interchange was built outside the station as part of the Cathedral Quarter redevelopment, where all buses continue to the bus station. 

===Air===
Manchester Airport, the busiest airport in the UK outside London, provides scheduled flights. It is located about south-east of the town.

===Waterways===
The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through Blackburn from Feniscowles in the south-west to Whitebirk in the north-east, skirting the town centre to the east of Blackburn railway station. This important early industrial artery arrived in 1810 and became the chief focus for industrial growth in the 19th century, with raw cotton imported via Liverpool. While it suffered neglect in the wake of the area&#x27;s industrial decline, the Blackburn stretch has benefited from a number of regeneration projects since the 1990s. British Waterways residential moorings are to be found at Finnington Lane Bridge on the western edge of the borough.

===Roads===
The M65 motorway passes to the south of Blackburn. It runs from Colne, about north-east of Blackburn, to a point close to the village of Lostock Hall near Preston, about west. Junction six of the motorway is located at the eastern edge of Blackburn, near the Intack area; junctions five and four are located to the south, near the village of Guide and the Lower Darwen area, respectively; and junction three is located at the south-western edge of the town, close to the Feniscowles area. The M65 links Blackburn to the national motorway network, connecting to junction nine of the M61 and junction 29 of the M6.

Other major roads in and around Blackburn include the A666 and the A677. The A666 runs from the A59 near the village of Langho, some north-west of Blackburn. It passes through the town centre and continues south through the towns of Darwen and Bolton, then south-west to the town of Pendlebury, near Manchester, where it joins the A6 at Irlams o&#x27; th&#x27; Height. The A677 runs from the east part of Blackburn, about from the centre. It passes through the centre of the town and continues to the western outskirts. It then heads north-west to the village of Mellor Brook before continuing west towards the city of Preston. It joins the A59 about west of Blackburn, about halfway between Blackburn and Preston. Barbara Castle Way, named after the former local MP, runs from Montague Street to Eanam Roundabout; it passes close to the town centre as part of the A6078 town centre orbital route.

==Landmarks==
===Cathedral===
Blackburn Cathedral was formerly St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church. It was reconsecrated in 1826 on the site of a previous church that had stood for several hundred years. In 1926 the Diocese of Blackburn was created and the church gained cathedral status. Blackburn was selected above other locations for the new wave of Archbishop Temple&#x27;s cathedrals because of its then excellent public transport infrastructure – the cathedral stands next to the bus and railway station. Between the 1930s and 1960s an enlarged cathedral was built using the existing building as the nave. Six of the cathedral&#x27;s bells were cast in 1737 and are claimed to derive from even older bells. An image of the cathedral is used behind BBC interviews filmed at BBC Radio Lancashire in Darwen Street, opposite the cathedral.

===Ewood Park===

The ground was opened in AprIl 1882. Work on the redeveloped, all-seater stadium got underway in February 1993 when the old Darwen End stand was demolished. This stand, with the old Blackburn End stand, was redeveloped before the Nuttall Street stand was also demolished ready for redevelopment in January 1994. Almost two years later, on 18 November 1995, the new Ewood Park was officially opened. With a capacity of 31,367, it consists of four sections: the Darwen End, Riverside Stand (so named as it stands on the banks of the River Darwen), Blackburn End, and Jack Walker Stand, named after a Blackburn industrialist and club supporter. The stadium also has conference and banqueting facilities.

===Queen Victoria&#x27;s statue===

Blackburn&#x27;s statue of Queen Victoria stands next to the cathedral grounds overlooking the Cathedral Square. Victoria&#x27;s fourth daughter, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, unveiled the statue on 30 September 1905. It was sculpted by the Australian Sir Bertram McKennal out of white Sicilian marble and stands on a grey granite plinth. It is high and weighs , while the plinth is high and weighs .

===Town Hall===

The construction of Blackburn&#x27;s original, Italian Renaissance style Town Hall was completed in 1856 at a cost of £35,000, equivalent to about £1.5 million as at 2008. The architect was James Paterson and the contractors were Richard Hacking and William Stones. It originally housed a police station with 18 cells, a large assembly room, and a council chamber. A tower block extension was constructed in 1969 at a cost of £650,000, equal to about £6.6 million as at 2008. The tower block is not strictly an extension to the earlier building: the two buildings are connected only by an elevated, enclosed footbridge. The tower block was high and the top was above sea-level when built, although it has since been re-clad and these figures may have altered slightly. The two buildings are known locally as the &quot;New Town Hall&quot; and &quot;Old Town Hall&quot; respectively.

===Technical School===

The school was built in the Northern Renaissance style and has a slate roof, an attic, a basement and two intermediate storeys. Made mainly of red brick and yellow terra cotta, it is profusely decorated. There are ornate gables, a round-arched entrance with angled turrets and balcony above; in addition, there is a frieze below the top storey with panels depicting art and craft skills. A Grade II listed building, it is now part of Blackburn College. The Prince of Wales placed a time capsule in the wall of the college during his visit. The college celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2013.

===Cotton Exchange===

The Cotton Exchange was built in 1865 as a trading point for the local cotton industry. Designed by William Brakspear, the building was repurposed in 1881 to make it more suitable as a performance hall. In 1918, it was refurbished as a cinema and continued to serve this purpose until its closure in 2005. The building was bought by the Re:Source charity in 2015 and has since hosted events such as the National Festival of Making, adidas Spezial Exhibition, and the Confessional Music and Arts Festival.

===Other landmarks===

The Wainwright Bridge was opened in June 2008. The £12 million bowstring arch bridge crosses the East Lancashire and Ribble Valley railway lines west of the town centre and forms part of the A6078 Town Centre Orbital Route. The bridge is named after Alfred Wainwright, after a vote by the townspeople. Blackburn Arena, opened in 1991, houses an ice rink and is home to the Blackburn Hawks ice hockey team.

Blackburn railway station features a mural by the Ormskirk-based artist Stephen Charnock. It shows eight famous faces associated with the town, including Mohandas Gandhi, who visited nearby Darwen in 1931. The station was renovated in 2000. BBC Radio Lancashire has its studios in Darwen Street in the town centre. Thwaites Brewery, which produces cask ale, has had a position in the centre of the town since 1870. There is also King George&#x27;s Hall, which is an arts and entertainment centre and Thwaites Empire Theatre. A section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through the town. St Anne&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is also situated in the centre of the town, is a Lombard Romanesque church, built in 1926, destroyed by arson in 2002 and rebuilt in 2004. The Canterbury Street drill hall was completed in 1870.

===Parks===

Corporation Park, north-west of the town centre, was built on of land bought from Joseph Feilden, lord of the manor, for in 1855. It opened on 22 October 1857, with shops and mills closing for the day, church bells ringing and flags flying from public buildings. Railway companies claimed 14,000 people travelled to the opening. A conservatory was opened on 16 May 1900. Corporation Park contains the Blackburn War Memorial which commemorates those who lost their lives in the two World Wars. The town&#x27;s annual Armistice parade concludes at the war memorial.

The town&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Park was opened in June 1887, having been laid out at a cost of £10,000 on land acquired by Blackburn Corporation from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1882. It originally had two bowling greens, two tennis courts, a lake of over , a children&#x27;s paddling pool, a bandstand, and a refreshment room. Two additional bowling greens and a pavilion were added in 1932.
Witton Country Park is a space to the west of the town. The land was purchased in 1946 and was the ancestral home of the Feilden family. It is larger than all the town&#x27;s other parks and playing fields put together. Witton Park High School is located within the park, as are three astroturf football pitches and a full-size athletic track, which is home to the Blackburn Harriers. The Blackburn model aircraft club also uses the park for radio-controlled aircraft. Pleasington cemetery and crematorium lie on its edges.

Roe Lee Park, in the north of the town, opened on Wednesday 30 May 1923 to commemorate a visit by George V. It was originally a site with five tennis courts and three bowling greens. The borough council website describes it as a &quot;urban fringe park with bowling greens, kick around area and children&#x27;s playground&quot;. In 2007, all four parks described here were winners of Green Flag awards.

Blackburn Cemetery is located to the north of the town centre in Roe Lee.

An ICT training suite at the library has been named the &quot;Bill Gates Room&quot;. Blackburn has smaller libraries for the Mill Hill, Livesey and Roman Road parts of the town, and a mobile library service.

:&quot;See List of schools in Blackburn with Darwen&quot;
Secondary education in Blackburn is provided by nine state-funded schools and one private school. In 2005, Tauheedul Islam Girls&#x27; High School became the first Muslim state school in the North West. It had previously been an independent school. Since then Tauheedul Islam Boys&#x27; High School has been established and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School joined the state-funded sector.

The town also has a few special schools. St Thomas&#x27;s and Sunnyhurst Pupil Referral Unit educates children unable to attend mainstream school for health reasons or other difficulties.

Over £25 million was invested in educational initiatives in Blackburn with Darwen in the late 2000s, including new schools, city learning centres and children&#x27;s centres. Over 11,000 adults take part in some form of educational programme. Blackburn with Darwen council has twice had Beacon Status for education in the &quot;Fostering School Improvement&quot; and &quot;Transforming the School Workforce&quot; categories. Compared with 56.5 per cent nationally, 51.3 per cent of pupils in Blackburn with Darwen achieve grades A*–C. The average GCE/VCE A/AS and Equivalent Point Score per Student is 649.7, compared with 716.7 nationally.

Although the town&#x27;s proportion of ethnic minorities is below 25%, in some schools the vast majority of pupils are from the ethnic minority population, whilst other schools are almost entirely white. This has been identified as a problem to racial integration in the town.

The independent school sector is represented by Westholme School and Jamiatul Ilm Wal Huda.

The two further education colleges in the town are Blackburn College and the sixth-form St. Mary&#x27;s College. The town does not have a university, but some higher education courses for over-18s are provided by the East Lancashire Institute of Higher Education (ELIHE).

==Cultural references==

Blackburn is mentioned in The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;.
:I read the news today—oh, boy
:4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
:And though the holes were rather small
:They had to count them all
:Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

The title of the unofficial fanzine of the town&#x27;s football club, Blackburn Rovers, is &quot;4,000 Holes&quot;, and the 1968 Beatles film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; has John mentioning the lyric as well in the &quot;Sea of Holes&quot;.

In 1975, documentary filmmaker Nick Broomfield and his wife Joan Churchill made &quot;Juvenile Liaison&quot; about a juvenile liaison project in the town. It examines a series of children and their run-ins with the law, over minor wrongdoings such as theft, truancy and abusive behaviour towards parents. After its production, the film was banned by the British Film Institute until 1990; &quot;Juvenile Liaison&quot; revolved mainly around the activities of Sergeant George Ray, whose preventive measures for dealing with young troublemakers fell mainly in the strong-arm category. In 1990, Broomfield and Churchill returned to Blackburn to film a follow-up. &quot;Juvenile Liaison 2&quot; revisits some of the residents from the first film, in an attempt to measure the success of the scheme.

The 1994 TV film &quot;Pat and Margaret&quot; starring Victoria Wood and Julie Walters was partly filmed in Blackburn.

The TV show &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot;, screened on BBC One from 1996 to 1998, included many scenes shot in Blackburn.

The 2005 British film &quot;Love + Hate&quot;, directed by Dominic Savage, was shot in Blackburn.

The film-makers Mitchell and Kenyon were based in Blackburn in the early 20th century. Much of their film stock, some 800 negatives, was found in their old premises on Northgate in 1994 and is now in the safekeeping of the aforementioned British Film Institute.

===St Peter&#x27;s Burial Ground===
During late 2015, work done on St Peter&#x27;s Burial Ground in advance of road construction involved disinterring the remains of nearly 2,000 individuals buried there during the cemetery&#x27;s period of operation (1821–1945). The burial ground had been connected with the former St Peter&#x27;s Church, a large one that seated some 1,500 people, which was demolished in 1976. Archaeologists found that nearly half of the bodies were those of young children, who appeared to have died quickly during the mid-19th century from illnesses affected the lungs and gastrointestinal system. The numbers are taken as reflecting the massive increase in the city&#x27;s population during that period due to its booming textile industry, which led to unhealthy living situations among the working classes.

The remains were to be relocated to another section of the cemetery. A memorial service conducted by Julian Henderson, the Bishop of Blackburn, for those being re-buried was scheduled to be held during the summer of 2016.

<text>The technology acceptance model (TAM) is an information systems theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.

The &quot;actual system use&quot; is the end-point where people use the technology. &quot;Behavioral intention&quot; is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the &quot;attitude&quot; (A) which is the general impression of the technology.

The model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:

*&quot;Perceived usefulness&quot; (PU) – This was defined by Fred Davis as &quot;the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance their job performance&quot;. It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.
*&quot;Perceived ease-of-use&quot; (PEOU) – Davis defined this as &quot;the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort&quot;. If the technology is easy to use, then the barrier is conquered. If it&#x27;s not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitude towards it.

&quot;External variables&quot; such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology. However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.

The TAM has been continuously studied and expanded—the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (or UTAUT). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of e-commerce with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use.

==Background==

TAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein&#x27;s theory of reasoned action (TRA) in the literature. Davis&#x27;s technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989)
is the most widely applied model of users&#x27; acceptance and usage of technology
(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and Richard Bagozzi. TAM replaces many of TRA&#x27;s attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures—&quot;ease of use&quot;, and &quot;usefulness&quot;. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act.

Bagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:

Earlier research on the diffusion of innovations also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms &quot;task fit&quot; to describe the metric. Legris, Ingham and Collerette suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.

==Usage==
Several researchers have replicated Davis&#x27;s original study to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use. Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. replicated the work of Davis to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.

Segars and Grover re-examined Adams et al.&#x27;s)replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.

Mark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis&#x27;s model into what they call the Usefulness/EOU Grid, which is a 2×2 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software.
The TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly

Saravanos et al. extended the TAM model to incorporate emotion and the effect that may play on the behavioral intention to accept a technology. Specifically, they looked at warm-glow.

Venkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2. 

* &quot;Subjective norm&quot; – An individual&#x27;s perception that other individuals who are important to him/her/them consider if he/she/they could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the theory of reasoned action (TRA).
* &quot;Voluntariness&quot; – This was defined by Venkatesh &amp; Davis as &quot;extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory&quot;.
* &quot;Image&quot; – This was defined by Moore &amp; Benbasat as &quot;the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one&#x27;s status in one&#x27;s social system&quot;.
* &quot;Job relevance&quot; – Venkatesh &amp; Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job.
* &quot;Output quality&quot; – Venkatesh &amp; Davis defined this as personal perception of the system&#x27;s ability to perform specific tasks.
* &quot;Result demonstrability&quot; – The production of tangible results will directly influence the system&#x27;s usefulness.

In an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.

In addition, authors Jun et al. also think that the technology acceptance model is essential to analyze the factors affecting customers’ behavior towards online food delivery services. It is also a widely adopted theoretical model to demonstrate the acceptance of new technology fields. The foundation of TAM is a series of concepts that clarifies and predicts people’s behaviors with their beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intention. In TAM, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, considered general beliefs, play a more vital role than salient beliefs in attitudes toward utilizing a particular technology.

==Alternative models==
# The MPT model: Independent of TAM, Scherer developed the matching person and technology model in 1986 as part of her National Science Foundation-funded dissertation research. The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text, &quot;Living in the State of Stuck&quot;, now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.
# The HMSAM: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. e-learning, learning management systems, webportals, etc.) (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015; Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users&#x27; intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.
# Extended TAM: Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users&#x27; attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.

==Criticisms==
TAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a &quot;theory&quot; include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value. Benbasat and Barki suggest that TAM &quot;has diverted researchers&#x27; attention away from other important research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the independent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion&quot;. In general, TAM focuses on the individual &#x27;user&#x27; of a computer, with the concept of &#x27;perceived usefulness&#x27;, with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user &#x27;perceives&#x27; &#x27;usefulness&#x27;, and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology. For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi.

Legris et al. claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system&#x27;s use.

Perceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine, mobile commerce,) and online banking.

<text>Nain Singh Rawat (21 October 18301 February 1882), was one of the first Indian explorers (dubbed &quot;pundits&quot;) employed by the British to explore the Himalayas and Central Asia. He came from the Johar Valley in Kumaon. He surveyed the trade route through Ladakh to Tibet, determined the location and altitude of Lhasa in Tibet, and surveyed a large section of Brahmaputra. His reports were initially made under the code name Number 9. He walked &quot;1,580 miles, or 3,160,000 paces, each counted.&quot;

==Early life==
Pundit Nain Singh Rawat was born to Lata Burha in 1830 in Milam village, a Bhotia village at the foot of the Milam glacier on the India-China border in present day Uttarakhand state of India. Milam is in the Johar Valley, one of the Bhotia abodes in the Kumaon division, where the river Goriganga originates. The Rawats ruled over the Johar Valley, during the reign of Chand dynasty in Kumaon; this was followed by the Gorkha rule. In 1816 the British defeated the Gorkhas but maintained a policy of non-interference and friendship towards the Johar Bhotias. The famous Bhotia explorers mostly belong to the villages of Johar.

After leaving school, Nain Singh helped his father. He visited different centres in Tibet with him, learned the Tibetan language, customs and manners and became familiar with the Tibetan people. This knowledge of the Tibetan language, local customs, and protocol came in handy in Nain Singh&#x27;s work as a &quot;spy explorer&quot;. Due to the extreme cold conditions, Milam and other villages of the upper Johar valley are inhabited only for a few months from June to October. During this time the men used to visit Gya&#x27;nyima, Gartok and other markets in Western Tibet.

== Schlagintweit expedition ==
Singh traveled to Ladakh in 1856 along with family members Mani and Dolpha Singh, accompanying an expedition by Hermann, Adolf, and Robert Schlagintweit. He learned the use of survey instruments during this expedition. The Schlagintweit brothers planned to send Nain and Mani Singh to Lhasa as well, but in the end, that expedition did not take place. They also wanted to take Singh with them back to Europe, but he declined. Adolf Schlagintweit wrote a letter of recommendation for Nain and Mani which they later presented to British survey officials.

== British Tibetan expeditions ==
=== Context ===
The East India Company, and later the British Empire, sought to form trade relations with Tibet. Additionally, exploration of Central Asia and Tibet were of particular interest during the Great Trigonometric Survey of India because their geography was largely unknown to the British. However, Qing China closed Tibet&#x27;s borders after gaining significant control over Tibet&#x27;s internal politics following the 1791 Sino-Nepalese War. A number of Europeans tried to reach Lhasa from India over the next hundred years; however, few successfully reached it, and local officials turned back most attempts at entry. A British attempt to reach Tibet from the east by travelling up the Yangtse River failed in 1861, and Edmund Smyth&#x27;s attempts to enter Tibet from the west between 1861 and 1863 all failed as well. Because of the Great Trigonometrical Survey&#x27;s past success with native surveyors, Thomas Montgomerie (the astronomical assistant of the survey), proposed that native explorers be recruited to explore Central Asia and Tibet. Montgomerie&#x27;s plan was approved in 1862, and his first recruits were Abdul Hamid for an expedition to Yarkand, followed by Nain Singh and his cousin Mani Singh for an expedition to Lhasa.

=== Recruitment and training ===
In an 1861 letter, Smyth recommended Singh as a possible surveyor to Walker. Walker travelled to meet with Singh and recruit him and his cousin Mani. The two were sent to Dehradun, the Survey&#x27;s headquarters, and placed under Montgomerie&#x27;s command. The two would spend two years training for their expeditions, learning a number of surveying techniques. Because the survey needed to be clandestine, a number of techniques were developed to hide the surveying. Mercury for thermometers was hidden in the bottom of a bowl, notes were stored inside a prayer wheel, and survey gear was hidden inside the luggage. A string of prayer beads, which usually had 108 beads, was modified to only have 100 beads; the pundits were trained to move one bead every hundred paces to count their steps. They were also trained to have a precise stride length of 33 inches across varying terrain.

=== First expedition ===
Singh&#x27;s first expedition began in 1865. He and Mani separated during the survey, with Mani travelling through western Tibet and Nain walking to Lhasa. Nain Singh reached Lhasa on 10 January 1866. He spent some time in Lhasa as a teacher of accounts before returning to India. During this expedition, Nain Singh estimated the altitude of Lhasa as 3,420 meters by boiling water; this was close to the actual value of 3,540 meters. He also estimated the position of Lhasa with celestial observations.

=== Second expedition ===
Singh&#x27;s second expedition explored western Tibet in 1867. Nain and Mani were accompanied by Kalian Singh, Nain&#x27;s brother, and the three disguised themselves as Bashahri traders. The expedition reached the goldfield at Thok Jalung, mapped the Sutlej river, performed an 850-mile-long route survey, and verified the position of Gartok. 

=== Third expedition ===
Singh&#x27;s third and final expedition returned to Lhasa via a more northern route than his first expedition and ran from 1873 to 1875.

=== Surveys ===
During his secret survey of Tibet, Nain Singh was the first non-Tibetan to visit many legendary areas of Tibet, including the Thok Jalung goldfields on 26 August 1867. He would later say that Thok Jalung was the coldest place he had ever visited.

Nain Singh was a cousin of Kishen Singh, another famous pundit explorer.

==Legacy==

In May 1877, Singh was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Patron&#x27;s Medal &quot;for his great journeys and Surveys in Tibet and along the Upper Brahmaputra, he has determined the position of Lhasa, and positive knowledge of the map of Asia.&quot; Henry Yule received the award on Singh&#x27;s behalf and in his acceptance speech said that &quot;[Singh&#x27;s] observations have added a larger amount of important knowledge to the map of Asia than those of any other living man.&quot;
On 27 June 2004, an Indian postage stamp featuring Nain Singh was issued commemorating his role in the Great Trigonometric Survey of India. In 2006, Shekhar Pathak and Uma Bhatt brought out a biography of Nain Singh with three of his diaries and the RGS articles about his travels in three volumes titled &quot;Asia ki Peeth Par&quot; published by Pahar, Naini Tal.

The mountains south of Lake Pangong are named Nain Singh Range in his memory and honour.

On 21 October 2017, Google celebrated Nain Singh Rawat&#x27;s 187th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>Rai Bahadur Kishen Singh or Krishna (–1921) was a native Indian explorer, termed a &quot;pundit&quot; by the British, who was employed by the Survey of India. His code-name was &#x27;A.K.&#x27; and his accomplishments would rival those of his famous cousin Nain Singh (code-named &#x27;The Pundit&#x27;).

==Early life==
He was born to a trader named Deb Singh. He was born at Milam village on India-China border now in present-day Pithoragarh district. His elder brother was Mani Singh. His cousin Nain Singh was also an explorer.

==Education (1862–1867)==
Singh simultaneous studied and worked as assistant at the Garbyang government school in the Dharchula area, and later progressed to obtain the &quot;Tehsil Mudarisi&quot; diploma from the Normal School at Almora. He taught at Milam Girls&#x27; School and the Garbyang government school.

==Explorer (1867–1885)==
Hired and trained by the Geological Survey of India&#x27;s Dehradun office, Singh then participated in the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and later became a trainer for the survey. James Walker, the superintendent of the survey, took him and his cousin Nain Singh on expeditions of Tibet and Central Asia. He was part of the several important expeditions listed below.

# 1869 Kailash-Mansarovar expedition.
# 1871–1872 Shigache–Lhasa expedition.
# 1873–1874 Yarkand–Kashgar expedition, second expedition of this area by Sir Thomas Douglas Forsyth.
# 1878–1882 Darjeeling–Lhasa–Mongolia expedition, stayed in Lhasa for a year masquerading as a merchant, surveyed Mekong, Salween, and Irrawaddy rivers.

He was also the first person to map the Ramgarh crater on a finer scale of (1 : 63,360).

==Retirement and death (1885–1921)==
Singh retired in 1885. In 1913 he became a guardian patron of the &quot;Johar Upkarini Mahasabha&quot; grassroot development co-operative society of the Johar Valley. He died in February 1921.

==Honors==
He received the following:

# Royal Geographical Society, an inscribed gold watch and 500 Indian rupees.
# Paris Geographical Society, a gold medal.
# Italian Geographic Society, a gold medal.
# British government of India, title of Rai Bahadur.
# British government of India: with a grant of jagir by British in Sitapur district of present-day Uttar Pradesh with annual revenue of INR1850.

<text>Hari Ram was a pundit who explored the region around Mount Everest in 1871-1872. At first he was not allowed to enter Tibet, but his luck changed when he met a district official whose wife was ill. He examined her, checked his medical book for a disease with similar symptoms, and gave her some pills. To his own surprise, the woman recovered, and from then he found relatively little difficulty in travelling on. He gave a frightening account of his trip along the Bhote Koshi river:

He followed the general course of the Bhotia-Kosi River, which he was obliged to cross fifteen times within twenty-five miles [40 km]. At one place the river ran in a gigantic chasm, the sides of which were so close to one another that a bridge of 24 paces was sufficient to span it. Near this bridge the precipices were so impractible that the path had to be supported on iron pegs let into the face of the rock - the path being formed by bars of iron and slabs of stone stretching from peg to peg and covered with earth. This extraordinary path is in no place more than eighteen inches [460 mm], and often not more than nine inches [230 mm] in width, and is carried for more than a third of a mile [500 m] along the face of the cliff, at some 1,500 feet [500 m] above the river, which could be seen roaring below in its narrow bed. The Pundit, who has seen much difficult ground in the Himalayas, says he never in his life met anything to equal this bit of path.
During his voyage, Hari Ram had opened up 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2) of virtually unknown territory. He had travelled all the way around Mount Everest, but because other mountains stood in between, he never actually saw it. On a second journey, Hari Ram traversed northern Nepal from west to east.

<text>Kinthup, a Lepcha man from Sikkim, was an explorer in the area of Tibet in the 1880s. He is best known for his impressive devotion to duty in surveying a previously unknown area of Tibet.

Laurence Waddell, who met Kinthup in 1892, described him as follows:

==Biography==

In the 1870s, the destination of the Tsangpo River (sometimes spelled &quot;Sanpo&quot;) was unknown. Some hypothesized that it was the same river that flowed into the Bay of Bengal under the name of Brahmaputra (also known as &quot;Dihang&quot;). To solve this mystery, Henry John Harman of the Great Trigonometrical Survey sent a pundit explorer, Nem Singh (known as &quot;G. M. N.&quot;) to follow the Tsangpo and determine its ultimate destination. G. M. N. was accompanied by his assistant, a Lepcha man from Sikkim named Kinthup. After surveying a good portion of the river, the pair returned to India.

In 1880, a Chinese lama was employed to continue G. M. N.&#x27;s work, and Kinthup was again hired to accompany him. In 1880 Kinthup was sent back with the task of testing the Brahmaputra theory by releasing 500 specially marked logs into the river at a prearranged time at which Captain Harman, posted men on the Dihang-Brahmaputra to watch for their arrival. However, in May 1881 near Tongyuk Dzong, the Chinese lama sold Kinthup to a regional lord to become his slave. Kinthup&#x27;s surveying equipment and notebooks were confiscated and he remained a slave until March 1882, when he finally managed to escape.

Resuming his survey of the river, he followed the gorge southward until he was captured by servants of his former master and again sold into slavery to the head abbot of a monastery. He was well-treated by his new master, and was granted several leaves of absence under the guise of making religious pilgrimages. This gave him the opportunity to prepare 500 logs and send a letter to Harman from Lhasa announcing his new intended schedule. He also made several long treks recording the extent of the Tsangpo and surrounding region, and determined that the two rivers were indeed one and the same. After fifteen months of servitude at the monastery, he was granted his freedom by the abbot, and was finally able to launch the logs. However, Harman had died in the interim and Kinthup&#x27;s letter went unread, so nobody checked for the appearance of the logs.

Kinthup returned to India in November 1884, four years after he had left. It was not until two years later that his account was even recorded, and even then his extraordinary accounts were doubted by some geographers. &quot;His accomplishment was not acknowledged until 1913, when F. M. Bailey and Henry Morshead validated his claims.&quot;

Captain Hugh Trenchard said, &quot;his account has been confirmed in the most remarkable manner, and we are now able to establish Kinthup&#x27;s claim to honorable record in the annals of the Survey of India, which he served with such zeal and devotion to duty.&quot; It was only some 30 years later that the Bailey–Morshead exploration of Tsangpo Gorge conclusively confirmed his discovery.

<text>Prior to European settlement, the [[Caribbean]] was dominated by forested ecosystems. The insular Caribbean has been considered a biodiversity hotspot. Although species diversity is lower than on mainland systems, endemism is high.

Species diversity is highest and endemism is lowest in Trinidad, which has a predominantly continental flora. Endemism is highest in Cuba and Hispaniola, the largest members of the Greater Antilles.

<text>Manius Curius Dentatus (died 270 BC) was a Roman general and statesman noted for ending the Samnite War and for his military exploits during the Pyrrhic War. According to Pliny, he was born with teeth, thus earning the surname Dentatus, &quot;toothed.&quot;

Dentatus was a tribune of the plebs sometime between 298 and 291 BC. As tribune, he foiled efforts by the &quot;interrex&quot; Appius Claudius Caecus to keep plebeian candidates out of the consular elections. If his tribunate is dated to 291, his actions advanced his own candidacy, but since Appius served three times as &quot;interrex&quot;, the earliest date accords better with the timeline of Dentatus&#x27;s own career.

Dentatus served his first term as consul in 290 BC, with a colleague by the name of P. Cornelius Rufinus (cos. 290 and 277 BC, dict. 276 BC and ancestor of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix the dictator) during which time he defeated both the Samnites and Sabines and celebrated two triumphs. Returning home he took on a massive public works project, partly draining Lake Velinus.

In 283, Dentatus filled the praetorship (or possibly the consulship) of L. Caecilius Metellus Denter after the latter was killed in the Battle of Arretium. Polybius says Dentatus drove the Gauls from their territory, clearing the way for the establishment of a colony at Sena.

As consul again in 275 BC, Dentatus fought Pyrrhus in the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum which nevertheless forced Pyrrhus out of Italy. As a result, he held a consecutive consulship, defeating the Lucani in the following year and earning an ovation. He was censor in 272, and in 270 he and Lucius Papirius Cursor were elected commissioners to oversee construction of the &quot;Anio Vetus&quot;, Rome&#x27;s second aqueduct, for which he used his personal share of the booty from his recent victories. He died during the project, which was completed under his fellow commissioner M. Fulvius Flaccus.

Dentatus is described as having been incorruptible and frugal; the story was that when the Samnites sent ambassadors with expensive gifts in an attempt to influence him in their favor, they found him sitting by the hearth roasting turnips. He refused the gifts, saying that he preferred ruling the possessors of gold over possessing it himself. Although the truth of this story is unclear — it may have been an invention of Cato — it was the inspiration for a number of paintings by Jacopo Amigoni, Govert Flinck, and others.

His &quot;praenomen&quot; is sometimes given erroneously as Marcus because the standard abbreviation of Manius (&quot;M&#x27;.&quot;) is confused with the &quot;M.&quot; that abbreviates &quot;Marcus&quot;.

The Dutch Study Association &#x27;S.V.T.B. Curius&#x27; at Delft University of Technology and its sub-association Dentatus are named after him.

<doc id="325564" wikidata="Q3188587" url="?curid=325564" title="J. F. Archibald">
<text>Jules François Archibald (born John Feltham Archibald, 14 January 1856 – 10 September 1919) was an Australian journalist and publisher, best known for co-founding and editing &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, Australia&#x27;s most popular magazine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was also the founder and namesake of the annual Archibald Prize, Australia&#x27;s most prestigious art prize for portraiture.

==Biography==
Born to an Irish Catholic family in Kildare, now known as Geelong West, Victoria, he was baptised John Feltham Archibald, but changed his forenames in later life &quot;when he became an enthusiast in everything French&quot;. Contemporary associates affectionately knew him as &quot;Archie&quot; and expressed admiration for his journalistic flair, literary perspicacity and culinary talents. He was also a target of humour because of his pretentious name change (pronounced &quot;Jules Franswa&quot;) and false pretensions to having a part-Scottish father and a French Jewish mother.

After working as an accountant, journalist (with the Melbourne &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;), public servant and miner in Victoria and Queensland, Archibald arrived in Sydney in 1878, where he formed a partnership with John Haynes and William Macleod, and on 31 January 1880 they launched &quot;The Bulletin&quot; as a weekly paper of political, business and literary news. William Henry Traill became a partner in 1882, and the following year Archibald left for two years in London. When he returned in 1886, the magazine was struggling, and Archibald bought out the other partners.

Under Archibald&#x27;s sole control, and with A. G. Stephens as his literary editor, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; became Australia&#x27;s leading outlet for poets, cartoonists, and authors of fiction and humour. Archibald had no life outside the magazine and devoted his every waking hour to it. It was his decision to open &quot;The Bulletin&quot;&#x27;s pages to contributions from readers, and his brand of radical, republican, xenophobic politics that the magazine reflected for the 16 years he controlled its content.
In 1902, Archibald&#x27;s health broke down and he resigned the editorship, though retaining overall control. Unable to rest, he launched a new monthly magazine, &quot;The Lone Hand&quot;. But soon afterwards, he had a complete collapse and spent several years in the Callan Park Hospital for the Insane. Even from there, he kept writing, and in 1907 published &quot;The Genesis of The Bulletin&quot;, an important source for the history of the magazine.

Archibald&#x27;s health never really recovered, and, in 1914, he sold his interest in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. He died in Sydney on 10 September 1919 and is buried in Waverley Cemetery. In his will, he made the two bequests by which he is best remembered by the general public: funds for the Archibald Fountain in Sydney&#x27;s Hyde Park, which he specified must be designed by a French sculptor, and the Archibald Prize for portraiture, now Australia&#x27;s most prestigious art prize.

<doc id="325569" wikidata="Q7972062" url="?curid=325569" title="Washington Monthly">
<text>Washington Monthly is a bimonthly, nonprofit magazine primarily covering United States politics and government that is based in Washington, D.C. The magazine also publishes an annual ranking of American colleges and universities, which serves as an alternative to &quot;Forbes&quot;″ and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s rankings.

==History==
The magazine was founded on February 19, 1969, by Charles Peters, who wrote the &quot;Tilting at Windmills&quot; column in each issue until 2014. Paul Glastris, former speechwriter for Bill Clinton, has been &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief since 2001. In 2008, the magazine switched from a monthly to a bimonthly publication schedule, citing high publication costs.

Past staff editors of the magazine include Jonathan Alter, Taylor Branch, James Fallows, Joshua Green, David Ignatius, Mickey Kaus, Nicholas Lemann, Suzannah Lessard, Jon Meacham, Timothy Noah, Joe Nocera, Nicholas Thompson, and Steven Waldman.

In 2008, the liberal watchdog and advocacy group Common Cause considered acquiring &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;, but the deal fell apart.

==Contents and viewpoint==
The politics of &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; are often considered center-left. Founder Charles Peters, who had long referred to himself as a New Deal Democrat, redefined himself as a neoliberal in the 1980s, becoming an early proponent of market-based reforms among Democrats. His columns also frequently emphasized the importance of a vigilant &quot;fourth estate&quot; in keeping government honest.

&quot;Washington Monthly&quot; features a continuing blog, &quot;Political Animal&quot;, which was written principally by Kevin Drum for several years, with frequent guest contributions by &quot;Washington Monthly&#x27;s&quot; current and alumni editors. In 2008, Steve Benen took over as lead blogger. In 2012, he was succeeded by Ed Kilgore. Kilgore left the magazine in 2015.

In addition to &quot;Political Animal&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s website hosts &quot;Ten Miles Square&quot;, a general blog featuring posts from staff and political scientists, which debuted in 2011, and &quot;College Guide&quot;, a blog about higher education, which the magazine began offering in 2009.

==College rankings==
&quot;Washington Monthly&quot;″s annual college and university rankings, a deliberate alternative college guide to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and &quot;Forbes College Rankings&quot; among domestic publications, began as a research report in 2005. It was introduced as an official set of rankings in the September 2006 issue.

Its &quot;National Universities Rankings&quot;, most recently published in 2023, began as a research report in 2005 with its first rankings appearing in the September 2006 issue. &quot;Washington Monthly &quot;rates schools &quot;based on their contribution to the public good in three broad categories: Social Mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), Research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and Service (encouraging students to give something back to their country).&quot;

==Funding==
The &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; receives financial support from the Lumina Foundation to provide coverage of post-secondary education-related issues. The magazine has also received funding from the Schumann Center for Media and Democracy, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and individual supporters, including Warren Buffett and Markos Kounalakis.

<doc id="325571" wikidata="Q7271845" url="?curid=325571" title="Quiet, Please">
<text>Quiet, Please! was a radio fantasy and horror program created by Wyllis Cooper, also known for creating &quot;Lights Out&quot;. Ernest Chappell was the show&#x27;s announcer and lead actor. &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; debuted June 8, 1947, on the Mutual Broadcasting System, and its last episode was broadcast June 25, 1949, on the ABC. A total of 106 shows were broadcast, with only a very few of them repeats.

Earning relatively little notice during its initial run, &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; has since been praised as one of the finest efforts of the golden age of American radio drama. Professor Richard J. Hand of the University of Glamorgan, in a detailed critical analysis of the series, argued that Cooper and Chappell &quot;created works of astonishing originality&quot;; he further describes the program as an &quot;extraordinary body of work&quot; which established Cooper &quot;as one of the greatest auteurs of horror radio.&quot; Similarly, radio historian Ron Lackmann declares that the episodes &quot;were exceptionally well written and outstandingly acted&quot;, while John Dunning describes the show as &quot;a potent series bristling with rich imagination.&quot;
==Broadcast history==

===Background===
&quot;Quiet, Please&quot; had its roots in &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; (1938–1940), the successor to Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;, which achieved notoriety with its 1938 adaptation of H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Cooper was a writer for &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;, and Chappell was the announcer. They became friends, and though Chappell had little (if any) acting experience, Cooper imagined him as the star of a new radio program. Cooper&#x27;s earlier &quot;Lights Out&quot; was famous for its gruesome stories and sound effects, but for &quot;Quiet, Please&quot;, Cooper would cultivate a subdued, slower-paced, and much quieter atmosphere that could still, at its best, match &quot;Lights Out&quot; for frights and thrills.
Chappell had ample experience in radio, but mostly as an announcer. As Hand writes, &quot;With &quot;Quiet, Please&quot;, Cooper gave Ernest Chappell the chance to act, and the result was a revelation. Chappell proved himself to be versatile in accent and delivery.&quot; The differences could be broad or subtle, but in nearly every episode, Chappell created a distinctive character, rarely using the same traits in multiple episodes. Writer Harlan Ellison, a longtime &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; fan, writes that the programs were &quot;backed by sound effects and music…but it was essentially Chappell, just speaking softly. Quietly. Terrifyingly.&quot; Ellison also describes Chappell as having &quot;one of the great radio voices. A sound that combined urbanity with storytelling wisdom.&quot;

===On the air===
&quot;Quiet, Please&quot; was produced at WOR in New York City, and began on the Mutual Network on June 8, 1947. Beginning in September, 1948, it was syndicated by ABC, though CBS executive Davidson Taylor expressed an interest in the show, writing in a memo in March 1948, &quot;I like this show a lot and believe we could get it if we wanted.&quot;

Each episode began with Chappell intoning the show&#x27;s title, followed by a long pause (sometimes up to seven seconds), before repeating the title. Then, the show&#x27;s theme music was played, a dirgey, funereal organ and Novachord version of a portion of the second movement of César Franck&#x27;s 1899 &quot;Symphony in D Minor&quot;. The introduction established the sparse, understated tone of the show, and has inspired collectors and reviewers to remark upon Cooper&#x27;s use of the dramatic power of silence.

Though the general thrust of the stories were fantasy, horror and suspense, Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; scripts covered a broad thematic range, including romance, science fiction, crime, family drama and humor (some of it quite self-deprecating). Dunning describes the show as &quot;outstanding dark fantasy;&quot; Hand notes that this description is broadly accurate, but that there are a few humorous or sentimental &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; episodes which &quot;aren&#x27;t particularly &#x27;dark&#x27;&quot;. Hand also suggests that &quot;any attempt to categorize the series feels like diminishing its scope of achievement.&quot; Regardless of content, most episodes had a dreamlike, surreal quality, where odd or paranormal events were not always explained: Dunning wrote that the show&#x27;s &quot;characters walked in a fuzzy dream world where the element of menace was ripe and ever present.&quot;

Hand writes that &quot;Cooper was a master of the opening line. Almost every episode of &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; begins with a sentence or two that hooks the listener, commanding their attention and their curiosity.&quot;

Most episodes featured no more than two or three actors, with Chappell taking the first person voice in all but a handful of episodes (with the closing describing him as &quot;the man who spoke to you&quot;), usually telling the tale via flashbacks. Dunning writes that &quot;Cooper&#x27;s pet hate was of &#x27;acting&#x27; and he wanted [each story] related with a deadpan sense of &#x27;here&#x27;s how it happened.&#x27;&quot; Chappell usually took a conversational tone, relating the stories slowly and casually; he frequently played a specialist worker, giving Cooper a chance to add background details from his own earlier jobs as a soldier, gandy dancer or oil platform worker. Though supporting players were sparse, a group of New York radio veterans were heard on a frequent basis: as female characters, in male bit parts, or as the supernatural or otherworldly beings the ordinary Chappell character encounters. Most notably, radio star Claudia Morgan (longtime voice of Nora Charles on &quot;The Adventures of the Thin Man&quot;, and not coincidentally, Ernest Chappell&#x27;s wife) was an occasional female lead, usually in tragic romances, and was heard in the final show (the appropriately titled &quot;Quiet, Please,&quot; a meditation on war and peace). In one lost show, &quot;Three Sides to a Story,&quot; Morgan&#x27;s father Ralph Morgan was also a guest. J. Pat O&#x27;Malley, later a familiar TV character actor, was another frequent voice, heard in more than a dozen shows throughout the run, beginning with the first broadcast &quot;Nothing Behind the Door.&quot; He played foreman Ted in &quot;The Thing on the Fourbleboard&quot; and was often used in parts requiring Irish or Scottish accents. Radio commentator and disc jockey Jack Lescoulie guest starred in the radio-themed &quot;Twelve to Five.&quot;

At the end of each program, Cooper offered a teaser for the next show. These were usually unrehearsed, and often displayed Cooper&#x27;s wry or morbid humor: &quot;My story for you next week is called &#x27;A Night to Forget&#x27;. It&#x27;s about a man who wished he could – and couldn&#x27;t.&quot; Cooper&#x27;s teaser was always followed by Chappell&#x27;s sign-off: &quot;And so, until next week at this same time, I am quietly yours, Ernest Chappell.&quot;

Compared to other contemporary radio dramas, &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; used fewer sound effects and less dialogue, relying instead on first person narration to drive each play. As noted above, silence was often used masterfully; a 1949 &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; article by John Crosby notes, &quot;There are long, long pauses, so long sometimes you wonder if your radio has gone on the blink. Networks are horrified at the amount of dead air they purchase along with Cooper. (A half hour Cooper script played at ordinary tempo would run about 11 minutes.)&quot; Though Crosby praised &quot;Quiet, Please&quot;, he thought the dramas sometimes employed confused, deus ex machina endings and characters were occasionally underdeveloped. He also wrote that Cooper &quot;avoids clichés with such intensity that he&#x27;s creating his own.&quot;

Most episodes had a strongly moralist tone: evildoers were nearly always punished, and good was typically rewarded. In 1949, Harriett Cannon wrote, &quot;Although in no sense a
&#x27;religious&#x27; show, [&quot;Quiet, Please&quot;] has some of its strongest
supporters among the clergy.&quot; In fact, Cooper often drew upon the Bible for inspiration, though he generally tweaked the stories and plots past the point of easy recognizability. Even the easily recognizable Bible stories are given a twist: &quot;The Third Man&#x27;s Story&quot; (6 September 1948) retells the story of Cain and Abel, suggesting that Cain&#x27;s act was motivated by Abel&#x27;s arrogance and taunts. Cooper&#x27;s scripts were, arguably, among the best of their era; Hand argues that &quot;Cooper employs excellent structuring devices in creating 30-minute radio drama,&quot; even comparing one episode (&quot;Three Sides to a Story&quot;) to Sartre&#x27;s &quot;No Exit&quot;. Love triangles were another frequent plot device for &quot;Quiet, Please&quot;.

As with many radio programs to feature prominent organ accompaniment, &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; was a rather low-budget undertaking. The show&#x27;s keyboardist (Albert Berman for most of the episodes), however, arguably utilized the instruments in a more innovative way than others—not only for punctuation of climactic moments, but also as an element of the scripts, as in the lazy, boogie woogie riffs in the clandestine casino scenes in &quot;Good Ghost&quot; (24 November 1948). The show&#x27;s theme was used as a plot device in at least three episodes: as a post-hypnotic trigger in by a hypnotist in &quot;Symphony in D Minor&quot; (13 September 1948), &quot;The Evening and the Morning&quot; and in &quot;Come In, Eddie&quot;.

Unusually for episodic radio drama, several episodes were sequels of earlier broadcasts, or at least recycled the same ideas: A character and setting from the very first episode &quot;Nothing Behind the Door&quot; (8 June 1947) are referenced in one of the last episodes, &quot;The Other Side of the Stars&quot;; in &quot;The Man Who Knew Everything&quot; (6 March 1949) the titular character seems to die at the episode&#x27;s end, only to return in &quot;The Venetian Blind Man&quot; (3 April 1949). Another pair of episodes, though not directly sequels, both feature an enchanted watch that allows its bearer to time travel: (&quot;It&#x27;s Later Than You Think&quot; (8 February 1948) and &quot;Not Responsible After Thirty Years&quot; (14 June 1948)

Despite some positive reviews (and a loyal audience that might be classified as a cult following, based on Crosby&#x27;s claim the network received more requests from fans for &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; scripts than for any other radio program) the show never established itself and never attracted a sponsor. &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; might have suffered from poor scheduling, which was often dependent upon a regular sponsor. During its first year, &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; was broadcast at 3.30 pm, a time slot usually reserved for after-school programming aimed at juveniles. Its second season found the show at a more appropriate 9.30 pm, but its third and final season the show was bumped again, this time to 5.30pm (noted times are Eastern Standard Time)

====&quot;The Thing on the Fourble Board&quot;====
Probably the most highly regarded episode of &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; is &quot;The Thing on the Fourble Board&quot; (August 9, 1948), about an oil-field worker who encounters a mysterious subterranean being hiding on the derrick&#x27;s catwalk. The unusual title is a bit of oil worker argot: the &quot;fourble board&quot; of an oil derrick is a narrow catwalk that is as high up as four lengths of drilling pipe placed vertically (two lengths of pipe are a &quot;double&quot;, three are a &quot;thribble&quot; and four are a &quot;fourble.&quot;)

The story&#x27;s effectiveness has led some fans to label the episode one of the best radio horror programs ever broadcast. Richard J. Hand of the University of Glamorgan notes that &quot;The Thing on the Fourble Board&quot; is not only cited as the finest example of radio horror, but occasionally cited as one of the best examples of radio drama as a whole. Especially effective was Cecil Roy&#x27;s vocal performance as the creature. Though she performs only very briefly, Roy&#x27;s vocal (barely recognizable as human) was cited by Dunning as still startling and chill-inducing even after decades.

According to Hand, Cooper&#x27;s script for the episode was dizzyingly multilayered, blending authentic details of oil rig workers&#x27; daily activities, with elements of what might be termed &quot;subterranea&quot; or Hollow Earth lore, yet managing to faintly invoke nautical stories like the kraken.

===In other media===
Cooper and Chappell remained friends after &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; went off the air, and even founded a production company, mainly to support their unsuccessful efforts to interest adapting &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; to television.

In 2004, at the Sacred Fools Theater Company in Los Angeles, Corey Klemow directed stage adaptations of two of the best-regarded Cooper scripts, &quot;The Thing on the Fourble Board&quot; and &quot;Whence Came You?&quot;

A film version of the episode &quot;The Evening &amp; The Morning&quot; appears on YouTube.

Since 2020, the Quietly Yours podcast has featured discussions of each episode of the series (in order of original broadcast).

==Meta-fiction==

Though many radio programs used various meta-fictional ploys, &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; arguably offered some of the most effective and intriguing examples. Hand writes that Cooper &quot;enjoys creating roles for the audience: passive listener, surreptitious eavesdropper, or even someone implicated in the action of the story itself.&quot; Scripts often broke down the fourth wall by speaking directly to the listener. On &quot;The Other Side of the Stars&quot;, (broadcast May 8, 1949), Chappell appeared as Esau (the name is another of Cooper&#x27;s many Biblical touches), a character who narrates the story as though he were broadcasting it on live radio; a show within a show. Esau relates the tale of his girlfriend&#x27;s odd fate after she discovered a conquistador&#x27;s armor while exploring a well in Arizona, but he is repeatedly interrupted by her brother, who arrived uninvited for the broadcast. Chappell&#x27;s character in &quot;Inquest&quot; is forced to stand in front of a vast, visible radio audience, while being assured that he will be supplied with sound effects as they are necessary to accompany the story he tells.

Several episodes blurred the distinction between performer and fictional character: In a few episodes (such as &quot;Is This Murder&quot;), Ernest Chappell portrayed a man named &quot;Ernest&quot;. In &quot;Where Do You Get Your Ideas?&quot; Cooper played himself, while Chappell portrayed a drunken barfly, pestering the writer. In the episode &quot;12 to 5&quot; (broadcast April 12, 1948), Chappell plays a disk jockey who delivers an on-air commercial for &quot;Chappell&#x27;s Apples&quot; (as well as a portion of the César Franck theme).

==Extant episodes==
For many years, the majority of the show&#x27;s episodes were feared lost, with only 12 episodes in general circulation among collectors. In the late 1980s, more than 80 episodes were discovered, comprising the majority of the series&#x27; run. Many of the recordings are of rather poor sound quality, but are nonetheless treasured by collectors. 88 episodes, plus half of an 89th, are currently in circulation. All the episodes are believed to be in the public domain, and can be downloaded free of charge. Another 17 are presumed lost, though, according to Hand, scripts survive for all of them.

The fact that any episodes of &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; survive in general circulation might well be due to Chappell&#x27;s efforts. He wrote to Cooper&#x27;s widow Emily in 1966 to report that he owned copies of all but 11 episodes on transcription discs and had copied them all to reel to reel tape. Stating that he would happily copy any episodes for Emily, Chappell further wrote that &quot;It took a lot of hours to make the tape transfers but I got a big thrill out of hearing them all over again and I want to say that there were many occasions when my emotions blew up and I just plain bawled. They brought back such wonderful times and so many intimate memories of such a treasured friend.&quot;

==Influence==
Writer Harlan Ellison has praised &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; and rates it as one of the finest and most effective programs in the history of radio or television. He discovered the show in his youth and states that even though the bulk of the episodes were lost for decades, several &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; episodes haunted his memory and exerted a strong influence on his writing.

In a 1981 column, Ellison wrote that he stumbled across one particular episode in his childhood, and afterwards, became a devoted &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; listener. He remembers the title of that episode as &quot;Five Miles Down.&quot; Ellison writes, &quot;I heard something I have never forgotten... What I heard that Sunday afternoon, so long ago, that has never left my thoughts for even one week, through all those years, was this:
:&quot;There is a place just five miles from where you now stand that no human eye has even seen. It is...five miles &quot;down!&quot;&quot;

Ellison goes on to relate the plot (at least as he remembers it after several decades, admitting that time might have altered some of the details), and asks, &quot;[H]ow many stories you heard or saw or read fifteen years ago, ten years ago, even &quot;five&quot; years ago...do you remember that clearly today? And I heard &#x27;Five Miles Down&#x27; at least &quot;forty&quot; years ago. And it&#x27;s still with me.&quot;

Ellison&#x27;s recollection is a little inaccurate: he relates the story being broadcast &quot;early in the Forties&quot; on &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; when it was in fact a late-1940s episode of another series, &quot;The Mysterious Traveler&quot;. In 2004, Ellison took part in a recreation of the &quot;Five Miles Down&quot; script (by Robert Arthur and David Kogan, not Wyllis Cooper) at a convention of the Society to Preserve and Encourage Radio Drama, Variety and Comedy. He &quot;acted and helped direct the show&quot; and recalled hearing the episode when he was growing up.

==Episode Influences==
In the October 17, 1948 episode titled &quot;And Jeannie Dreams of Me&quot; the Stephen Foster song Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair figured prominently. The episode uses the song throughout and its title is a reversal of the song title which acts as a foreshadowing to the theme of the episode.

<doc id="325572" wikidata="Q2917181" url="?curid=325572" title="China and the United Nations">
<text>China is one of the members of the United Nations and is one of five permanent members of its Security Council. One of the victorious Allies of World War II (the Chinese theatre of which was the Second Sino-Japanese War), the Republic of China (ROC) joined the UN as one of its founding member countries in 1945. The subsequent resumption of the Chinese Civil War between the government of Republic of China and the rebel forces of the Chinese Communist Party, led to the latter&#x27;s victory on the mainland and the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. Nearly all of mainland China was soon under its control and the ROC government (then referred to in the West as &quot;Nationalist China&quot;) retreated to the island of Taiwan.

The One-China policy advocated by both governments dismantled the solution of dual representation but, amid the Cold War and Korean War, the United States and its allies opposed the replacement of the ROC at the United Nations until 1971, although they were persuaded to pressure the government of the ROC to accept international recognition of Mongolia&#x27;s independence in 1961. The PRC sought to be recognized by the United Nations from the 1950s, but at least until 1961, the United States managed to keep the PRC out of the UN. The General Assembly Resolution 1668 which demanded a majority of two thirds for the recognition of new members was adopted in 1961. Canada and other allies of the United States individually shifted their recognitions of China to the PRC, which the US opposed. Some attempted to recognize both Chinas separately which both Chinas opposed declaring each one was the only legitimate representative of China. Annual motions to replace the ROC with the PRC were introduced first by the Soviet Union, then India and also Albania, but these were defeated.

Amid the Sino-Soviet split and Vietnam War, United States President Richard Nixon entered into negotiations with Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong, initially through a secret 1971 trip undertaken by Henry Kissinger to visit Zhou Enlai. On 25 October 1971, a motion to recognize the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the sole legal China, initiated by 17 UN members led by Albania, was passed as General Assembly Resolution 2758. It was supported by most of the communist states (including the Soviet Union) and non-aligned countries (such as India), but also by some NATO countries, such as the United Kingdom and France. After the PRC was seated on 15 November 1971, Nixon then personally visited mainland China the next year, beginning the normalization of PRC-USA relations. The Republic of China maintained the view it was the sole legitimate representative of China until 1988, but eventually turned to a foreign policy which sought international recognition through a so-called checkbook diplomacy. These moves have been opposed and mostly blocked by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, forcing the Republic of China to join international organizations under other names, including &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; at the International Olympic Committee.

The Republic of China&#x27;s most recent request for admission was turned down in 2007, but a number of European governments—led by the United States—protested to the UN&#x27;s Office of Legal Affairs to force the global body and its secretary-general to stop using the reference &quot;Taiwan is a part of China&quot;. 

== Activity ==
The Government of the Republic of China (ROC) (now Taiwan) used its Security Council veto only once, to stop the admission of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic to the United Nations in 1955 on the grounds it recognized all of Mongolia as a part of China. During the 1950s the PRC began to demand to be recognized by the UN instead of the Government of the ROC.

The UN seat for &quot;China&quot; was originally occupied and represented by delegates of the Republic of China, and due to UN Resolution 2758, these delegates were expelled and replaced with delegates from the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 25 October 1971. As a result of the Republic of China losing the UN China seat, the country became referred to as &quot;Taiwan&quot; by other countries since Taiwan covers 99% of the ROC-controlled territories.

, the People&#x27;s Republic of China had used its Security Council veto eight times, fewer than all other countries with the veto: in 1972 to veto the admission of Bangladesh (which it recognized as a province of Pakistan), in 1997 to veto ceasefire observers to Guatemala (which recognised the ROC as the legitimate government of China), in 1999 to veto an extension of observers to the Republic of Macedonia (same), in 2007 (in conjunction with Russia) to veto criticizing Myanmar (Burma) on its human rights record, in 2008 (with Russia) to veto sanctions against Zimbabwe, in 2011 (with Russia) to veto sanctions against Syria, and in February 2012 (with Russia) to veto for the second time a draft resolution calling for foreign military intervention in Syria.

The ROC co-founded the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in 1943 (prior to the establishment of UN). UNRRA provided supplies and services to areas under occupation by the Axis Powers. The largest project undertaken by UNRRA was the China program which had a total estimated cost of $658.4 million. UNRRA China Office was opened in Shanghai at the end of 1944, and operated until the official termination of the office on 31 December 1947. Final work and responsibilities were finished by March, 1948. UNRRA cooperated with Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, led by Jiang Tingfu, to distribute relief supplies in China. UNRRA functions were later transferred to several UN agencies, including the International Refugee Organization and the World Health Organization.

Peng Chun Chang of ROC was the vice-chairman of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Eleanor Roosevelt, as the driving force behind the Declaration, recalled in her memoirs:

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN General Assembly as Resolution 217 A(III) on 10 December 1948, as the result of the experience of the Second World War. The ROC was one of the 48 states that voted for it.

On 1 February 1951, after cease fire negotiations failed, United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 498 and called the intervention of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in Korea an act of aggression.

, China had sent 3,362 military personnel to 13 UN peacekeeping operations in its first dispatch of military observers to the United Nations peacekeeping operations since military team to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For 2013–2015, China ranked seventh among member states for contributing 3.93% of the United Nations Peacekeeping operations. By 2019, it was the tenth largest contributor but was providing more troops, police officers, and military observers than any other permanent member of the Security Council. As of 2022, it was providing roughly 20% of the UN peacekeeping standby force, more than all other Security Council members combined.

The International Criminal Court is a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The court has jurisdiction if a situation is referred to the court by the United Nations Security Council. As of May 2013, 122 states have ratified or acceded to the Rome Statute that established the Court, but the PRC is not one of them. The PRC, as well its neighbouring rival India, has been critical of the court, as is the US which is also a non-signatory nation.

Since the mid-2010s, China has sought more leadership roles and policy influence in UN bodies. Chinese diplomats have held leadership roles in the Food and Agriculture Organization, Interpol, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the UN Industrial Development Organization, and the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

China is active in its diplomacy with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the UN agency in charge of establishing common standards for telecommunications technologies. China is an active participant in the agency&#x27;s work, is a significant donor, and Chinese experts have held leadership roles in the ITU. China seeks to obtain support in the ITU for China&#x27;s internet protocol.

Institutional connections between China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative and multiple UN bodies have also been established. UN Secretary General António Guterres has praised the BRI for its capacity to advance the UN&#x27;s sustainable development goals.

In United Nations bodies, China argues for a way of looking at the concept of universal human rights that differs from the Western view. China&#x27;s view is that a focus on political rights and values is a too narrow view of human rights, and should instead focus on economic outcomes, material well-being of people, and national sovereignty.

On 4 July 2024, China rejected Western human rights reform recommendations at a U.N. Human Rights Council session but accepted nearly 70% of suggestions from allies. Critics argue this acceptance rate is misleading due to lobbying efforts, while the U.S. and UK expressed disappointment, and Russia and Gambia praised China&#x27;s approach.

Publishing in 2024, academic Sun Yi states that China has &quot;played an increasingly dynamic role in energizing&quot; the UN&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage Cooperation program.

=== Voting trends ===
China works hard to cultivate favorable votes from African countries at the United Nations. It has often been successful, and the voting pattern of the Africa countries which rotate on the Security Council and African members of the Human Rights Council generally align more frequently with China than with the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.

The General Assembly votes of African countries and China have also generally aligned. As part of China&#x27;s view of South-South cooperation, it often seeks to base its UN voting behavior on the positions of regional groupings in the global South like the Arab League or the African Union. Where there are differences among African countries, China generally encourages those countries to reach a regional consensus.

Within the United Nations Security Council, China is generally aligned with the other permanent members. From 1991 to 2020, its disagreements with the United States have primarily come over issues related to the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, with those disagreements increasing over time. These areas of increasing disagreement often involve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and matters of state sovereignty, as discussed below.

Before its entry to the UN, China viewed UN peacekeeping missions negatively, regarding them as an attempt to infringe on countries&#x27; sovereignty. After its UN entry, China&#x27;s opposition to such missions was generally verbal, rather than reflected in its votes; it chose not to participate in such decisions rather than actively using its votes against them.

Thus, China rarely used its veto power before 2011. It instead used abstention to avoid express disapproval without directly confronting its fellow permanent members. Also prior to 2011, China was increasingly open to the concept of responsibility to protect, especially in relation to Sudan and Darfur.

These trends began to change following the Arab awakening and the NATO invasion of Libya in 2011. China voted yes on UNSCR 1970 to refer Muammar Gaddafi to the International Criminal Court, but abstained on UNSCR 1973, which established a no-fly zone and authorized sanctions against Libya. Shortly after the vote, NATO invaded Libya, resulting in the overthrow of Gaddafi, his public execution, a civil war that continues through 2022. China has since &quot;held up Libya as an example of the United States and the rest of the West using humanitarian concerns to justify aggression and regime change by force.&quot; Its views on territorial sovereignty have thus hardened since 2011. Thus, for example, between 2010 and 2020 China vetoed ten resolutions regarding Syria and takes a more vocal position in the UN regarding matters of sovereignty.

From 1991 to 2020, the vast majority of China&#x27;s abstentions and all of its vetoes have occurred on issues that involve territorial integrity, primarily sanctions and the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. In her analysis of China&#x27;s security council voting behavior, Professor Dawn C. Murphy concludes, &quot;These votes directly correspond to China&#x27;s promotion of the Five Principles, especially the principles of mutual respect for territory and sovereignty and mutual noninterference in the internal affairs of other states.&quot;

China consistently opposes sanctions, although there have been some exceptions. For example, in addition to the Libyan sanctions discussed above, China voted in favor of sanctioning North Korea in 2006 for its nuclear program. China has also voted yes on seven sanctions votes against Iran in relation to its developing nuclear program. Its atypical votes regarding Iran may arguably be explained by a desire not to confront the United States on a matter that the United States believes to be a vital national interest.

== History ==

=== Republic of China in the United Nations (1945–1971) ===

The Republic of China (ROC) was a charter member of the United Nations and one of five permanent members of the Security Council until 1971. The ROC joined the United Nations as a founding member on 24 October 1945.

The &quot;Big Four&quot; victors of World War II (Nationalist China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) were the founding members of the United Nations that drafted the United Nations Charter in 1944, which was ratified on 26 June 1945 by the representatives of 50 countries. China, in recognition of its long-standing fight against aggression, was accorded the honor of being
the first to sign the UN Charter. President Franklin Roosevelt had acknowledged China&#x27;s war effort in World War II and stated his desire to allow China to &quot;play its proper role in maintaining peace and prosperity&quot; in the world. Thus, despite opposition from other leaders, especially Winston Churchill, China became a permanent member of the Security Council from its creation in 1945.

In 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) won the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and established the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China. The ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan (which it gained control of in 1945 at the end of hostilities in WWII), Quemoy Island, and the Matsu Islands. The ROC legally claimed to be the sole legitimate government of China until 1988, and during the 1950s and 1960s this claim was accepted by the United States and most of its allies. While the PRC was an ally of the Soviet Union, the United States sought to prevent the Communist bloc from gaining another permanent seat in the Security Council. To protest the exclusion of the PRC, Soviet representatives boycotted the UN from January to August 1950. The Soviet UN ambassador Yakov Malik threatened the Soviets would not feel bound by UN decisions taken in presence of representatives of the Kuomintang the Government of the ROC. The boycott led to the Soviets not being able to veto the UN resolution which allowed an intervention of UN military forces in Korea.
The ROC complained to the UN against the Soviet Union for violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and the United Nations Charter in 1949; as a result, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 291 and 292, referring the complaint &quot;to the Interim Committee of the General Assembly for continuous examination and study&quot;. In 1952, the United Nations General Assembly found that the Soviet Union prevented the National Government of the ROC from re-establishing Chinese authority in Manchuria after Japan surrendered, and gave military and economic aid to the CCP, who founded the PRC in 1949, against the National Government of the ROC. Resolution 505 was passed to condemn the Soviet Union with 25 countries supporting, 9 countries opposing, 24 countries abstaining, and 2 countries non-voting. The resolution also affirmed the ROC as the &quot;Central Government of China&quot;.

The ROC used its veto only once. Recognition of the Soviets&#x27; violation of their friendship treaty abrogated its recognition of Mongolia&#x27;s independence. It therefore vetoed its admission into the United Nations on 13 December 1955, claiming it—as Outer Mongolia—to be an integral part of China. Mongolia&#x27;s application had been tabled at the UN on 24 June 1946, but had been blocked by Western countries, as part of a protracted Cold War dispute about the admission of new members to the UN. The General Assembly, by Resolution 918 (X) of 8 December 1955, had recommended to the Security Council that this dispute should be ended by the admission, in a single resolution, of a list of eighteen countries. On 14 December 1955, the Security Council adopted a compromise proposed by the Soviet Union, and the General Assembly, by Resolution 995 (X), admitted sixteen countries into UN, omitting Mongolia and Japan from the list.
This postponed the admission of Mongolia until 1961, when the Soviet Union agreed to lift its veto on the admission of Mauritania, in return for the admission of Mongolia. Faced with pressure from nearly all the other African countries, the ROC relented under protest. Mongolia and Mauritania were both admitted to the UN on 27 October 1961. The same year, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1668 made China&#x27;s representation an &quot;important question&quot; requiring a two-thirds majority vote to alter.

The 1954 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Nobel Foundation noted that UNHCR, among other contributions, was asked by the UN General Assembly (Resolution 1167 and 1784), in 1957 and again in 1962, to assist Chinese refugees in Hong Kong whose numbers are estimated at over one million. UNHCR assistance was also given to needy refugees among the Chinese refugees in Macao, and the Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal. India hosted some 110,000 Tibetan refugees as of the end of 2001. UNHCR estimates that there are 15,000 Tibetans who arrived in Nepal prior to 1990 and were recognized by the Government as refugees.

From the 1960s onwards, nations friendly to the PRC, led by the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha, moved an annual resolution in the General Assembly to expel the &quot;representatives of Chiang Kai-shek&quot; (an implicit reference to the ROC) and permit the PRC to represent China at the UN. Every year the United States was able to assemble enough votes to block this resolution. Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the One-China policy.

On 29 September 1960, Nepali PM BP Koirala proposed UN general assembly to make PRC a member of UN: In our opinion, the United Nations can neither become universal nor can it reflect the political realities existing in the world today until the People&#x27;s Republic of China is given its rightful place in the organization. The United Nations will not be able to fulfill effectively some of its most important purposes and functions until the People&#x27;s Republic of China is brought in.

The admission of newly independent developing nations in the 1960s gradually turned the General Assembly from being Western-dominated to being dominated by countries sympathetic to the PRC. Not only the newly founded developing countries, but also most of the Western countries eventually decided to recognise the PRC. During the 1950s and 1960s, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, and France shifted their recognition of China from the ROC to the PRC. In the early 1970s, Canada, Turkey, and more western countries established diplomatic relations with the PRC, and severed diplomatic relations with the ROC.

In a Security Council meeting on 9 February 1971, Somalia objected to the credentials of the representative of Republic of China as the representative occupying the United Nations seat for China, and ROC and the United States responded that the question of China&#x27;s representation should not be dealt with in the Security Council.

On 15 July 1971, 17 UN members requested that a question of the &quot;Restoration of the lawful rights of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the United Nations&quot; be placed on the provisional agenda of the twenty-sixth session of the UN General Assembly, claiming that the PRC, a &quot;founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council, had since 1949 been refused by systematic manoeuvres the right to occupy the seat to which it is entitled ipso jure&quot;. On 25 September 1971, a draft resolution, A/L.630 and Add.l and 2, was submitted by 23 states including 17 of the states which had joined in placing the question on the agenda, to &quot;restore to the People&#x27;s Republic of China all its rights and expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek.&quot; On 29 September 1971, another draft resolution, A/L.632 and Add.l and 2, sponsored by 22 members, was proposed declaring that any proposal to deprive the Republic of China of representation was an important question under of the UN Charter, and thus would require a two-thirds supermajority for approval. A/L.632 and Add.l and 2 was rejected on 25 October 1971 by a vote of 59 to 55, with 15 abstentions.

Saudi Arabia submitted a proposition allowing the ROC to retain its seat at the UN and its affiliated organizations &quot;until the people of the Island of Taiwan are enabled by a referendum or a plebiscite&quot; under the auspices of the UN to choose among three options: continued independence as a sovereign state with a neutral status defined by a treaty recorded by the UN; a confederation with the PRC; or a federation with the PRC, but was not supported by the United States.

Seeking to place more diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union, United States president Richard Nixon sent his national security advisor Henry Kissinger on two trips to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in July and October 1971 (the first of which was made in secret via Pakistan) to confer with Premier Zhou Enlai, then in charge of Chinese foreign policy. His trips paved the way for the groundbreaking 1972 summit between Nixon, Zhou, and CCP Chairman Mao Zedong, as well as the formalization of relations between the two countries, ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility in favour of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States.

On 25 October 1971, the United States moved that a separate vote be taken on the provisions in the resolution &quot;to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupied at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it&quot; in the draft resolution. By this the United States was proposing that while the credentials of the PRC representatives would be accepted and the PRC would be seated as China&#x27;s representative with a seat on the Security Council, the ROC would continue to enjoy representation in the General Assembly. The proposition was legally untenable. Being China a founding member, the ROC had been a member of the United Nations; the presence of its representatives at the UN having always been predicated on its claim to represent China. The motion was rejected by a vote of 61 to 51, with 16 abstentions. The representative of ROC made a declaration that the rejection of the 22-power draft resolution calling for a two-thirds majority was a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter which governed the expulsion of Member States and that the delegation of the Republic of China had decided not to take part in any further proceedings of the General Assembly. With the support from 26 African UN Member States and in accordance with Article 18 of the UN Charter, the Assembly then adopted Resolution 2758, with 76 countries supporting, 35 countries opposing, 17 countries abstaining, and 3 countries non-voting, withdrawing recognition of the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate representative of China, and recognizing the Government of PRC as the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations. At a Security Council meeting on 23 November 1971, after the General Assembly passed Resolution 2758, the President of the council and the other representatives made statements welcoming the representatives of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The ROC lost not only its Security Council seat, but any representation in the UN.

==== Efforts to reintroduce the ROC to the UN ====

Following the adoption of Resolution 2758, the Republic of China was no longer represented by a Permanent Representative at the UN. UN Secretary-General U Thant sent a message to the PRC government asking him to send a delegation to Security Council soon. In addition to losing its seat in the UN, the UN Secretary-General concluded from the resolution that the General Assembly considered Taiwan to be a province of China, and thus it does not permit the ROC to become a party to treaties for which it is the depository.

In 1993 the ROC began campaigning to rejoin the UN separately from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. A number of options were considered, including seeking membership in the specialized agencies, applying for observer status, applying for full membership, or having resolution 2758 revoked to reclaim the seat of China in the UN.

Taiwan&#x27;s attempts were unsuccessful as the General Assembly&#x27;s General Committee declined to put the issue on the Assembly&#x27;s agenda for debate, under strong opposition from the PRC.

While all these proposals were vague, requesting the ROC be allowed to participate in UN activities without specifying any legal mechanism, in 2007 President Chen Shui-bian submitted a formal application under the name &quot;Taiwan&quot; for full membership in the UN.&lt;ref name=&quot;A/62/193&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September 2007, over 3,000 Taiwanese Americans and their supporters rallied in front of the UN building in New York City, and over 300,000 Taiwanese people rallied in Taiwan, all in support of the ROC joining the UN. The ROC also won the backing of many Members of the European Parliament on this issue. However, the application was rejected by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs citing General Assembly Resolution 2758, without being forwarded to the Security Council. Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon stated that:
Responding to the UN&#x27;s rejection of its application, the ROC government has stated that Taiwan is not now nor has it ever been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that since General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not clarify the issue of Taiwan&#x27;s representation in the UN, it does not prevent Taiwan&#x27;s participation in the UN as an independent sovereign nation. The ROC argued that Resolution 2758 merely transferred the UN seat from the ROC to the PRC, but did not address the issue of Taiwan&#x27;s representation in the UN. The ROC government also criticized Ban for asserting that Taiwan is part of China and returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly, contrary to UN&#x27;s standard procedure (Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council, Chapter X, Rule 59). The ROC emphasized that the United Nations has never taken a formal stance regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan. On the other hand, the PRC government, which has stated that Taiwan is part of China and firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN either as a member or an observer, praised that UN&#x27;s decision &quot;was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly, and showed the UN and its member states&#x27; universal adherence to the one-China principle&quot;. A group of UN member states put forward a draft resolution for that autumn&#x27;s UN General Assembly calling on the Security Council to consider the application.

Ban Ki-moon also came under fire for this statement from the United States via non-official channels. There are unconfirmed reports that Ban&#x27;s comments prompted the US to restate its position regarding the status of Taiwan. A Heritage Foundation article suggests that the US may have presented a démarche stating among others that:If the UN Secretariat insists on describing Taiwan as a part of the PRC, or on using nomenclature for Taiwan that implies such status, the United States will be obliged to disassociate itself on a national basis from such position.&quot;

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticized Ban Ki-moon for rejecting the ROC&#x27;s July 2007 application and regarded Ban&#x27;s interpretation of Resolution 2758 (that Taiwan was part of China) as erroneous. Nevertheless, Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon&#x27;s statement reflected long-standing UN convention to deny the ROC representation and is mirrored in other documents promulgated by the United Nations. For example, the UN&#x27;s &quot;Final Clauses of Multilateral Treaties, Handbook&quot;, 2003 (a publication which predated his tenure in Office) states:

[r]egarding the Taiwan Province of China, the Secretary-General follows the General Assembly&#x27;s guidance incorporated in resolution 2758 (XXVI)of the General Assembly of 25 October 1971 on the restoration of the lawful rights of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the United Nations. The General Assembly decided to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. Hence, instruments received from the Taiwan Province of China will not be accepted by the Secretary-General in his capacity as depositary.

In 2008, two referendums by the ROC on joining the UN failed because of low voter participation. That autumn the ROC took a new approach, with its allies submitting a resolution requesting that the &quot;Republic of China (Taiwan)&quot; be allowed to have &quot;meaningful participation&quot; in the UN specialized agencies. Again the issue was not put on the Assembly&#x27;s agenda when the United Nations subcommittee ruled it would not let the General Assembly consider the ROC&#x27;s application to join UN activities. Shortly after this, the United States and the national governments of the European Union expressed their support for &quot;Taiwan&quot; (none of them recognises the ROC) to have &quot;meaningful participation&quot; in UN specialized agencies, such as the World Health Organization. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the World Health Organization to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. This was the ROC&#x27;s first participation in an event organized by a UN-affiliated agency since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before.

In 2009, the ROC chose not to bring the issue of its participation in the UN up for debate at the General Assembly for the first time since it began the campaign in 1993.

A 2013 United States congressional report describes US bipartisan &quot;One China&quot; policy as follows:

The United States has its own &quot;one China&quot; policy (vs. the PRC&#x27;s &quot;one China&quot; principle) and position on Taiwan&#x27;s status. Not recognizing the PRC&#x27;s claim over Taiwan nor Taiwan as a sovereign state, United States policy has considered Taiwan&#x27;s status as unsettled.

Since Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016, there are growing number of renewed attempts to join the United Nations in its own right under the name &quot;Taiwan&quot; but this was prevented by the PRC. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken supported Taiwan&#x27;s participation in the UN in 2021, the 50th anniversary of the ROC&#x27;s membership replaced with the PRC at the United Nations. Similar attempts to join the World Health Organization in 2023 were rebuffed.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China in the United Nations (since 1971) ===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), commonly called China today, was admitted into the UN in 1971 on the 21st time of voting on its application. The PRC was admitted into the UN on a vote of 76 in favor, 35 opposed, and 17 abstentions. In a letter to the United Nations on September 29, 1972, the PRC asserted that it had no obligation to honor multilateral treaties that may have been ratified by the Republic of China under the governance of Chiang Kai-shek, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966, though the PRC in 1971 affirmed acceptance of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by virtue of simply becoming UN members.

In the 1960s and early 1970s that the United States&#x27; close ally, Pakistan, especially under the presidency of Ayub Khan, was carrying out messenger diplomacy to the PRC&#x27;s entry into the UN by the United States&#x27; diplomacy to People&#x27;s Republic of China in the time of Sino-Soviet split. This involved secret visits by United States officials to the PRC. In 1971, Henry Kissinger made a secret visit to the PRC through Pakistan.

In 1974, China announced its Three Worlds Theory at the UN.

Since the early 1980s, and particularly since 1989, by means of vigorous monitoring and the strict maintenance of standards, United Nations human rights organizations have encouraged China to move away from its insistence on the principle of noninterference, to take part in resolutions critical of human rights conditions in other nations, and to accept the applicability to itself of human rights norms and UN procedures. Even though China has continued to suppress political dissidents at home, and appears at times resolutely defiant of outside pressure to reform, Ann Kent argues that it has gradually begun to implement some international human rights standards. On human rights issues, the PRC has been increasingly influential by the bargaining of its robust macroeconomics growth for the domestic social equality. In 1995, they won 43 percent of the votes in the General Assembly; by 2006 they won 82 percent.

Until the 1980s, China was skeptical of UN Security Council resolutions on peace and security, tending to view them as a mechanism for great power interference in other countries. Beginning in 1982, China started to contribute financially to peacekeeping operations and in 1990 contributed peacekeepers for the first time.

When an enlargement of the Security Council was discussed in 1995, China encouraged African states to demand seats for themselves as a counter-move to Japan&#x27;s ambitions, and thereby nullified the Japanese initiative.

China held its first joint training course with the United Nations Peacekeeping Department in 2016.

In 2019, the United Nations Human Rights Office was accused of handing over since 2013 lists of names of human rights activists that included Tibetan and Uyghur dissidents, some of whom were U.S. nationals and residents. Initially the OHCHR denied the accusation but then confirmed the sharing of names but refuted that it had resulted in harmful effects on the human rights defenders in question. This was discussed in a States General of the Netherlands parliamentary session. In 2021, China called the assessment of the UN Human Rights Office report on Xinjiang regarding human rights abuses against the Uyghurs &quot;invalid and illegal.&quot;

<text>Vernicia fordii (usually known as the tung tree (, &quot;tóng&quot;) and also as the tung-oil or tungoil tree (), the kalo nut tree, and the China wood-oil tree) is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family &quot;Euphorbiaceae&quot;. It is native to southern China, Myanmar, and northern Vietnam. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 20 m tall, with a spreading crown. The bark is smooth and thin, and bleeds latex if cut. The leaves are alternate, simple, 4.5–25 cm long and 3.5–22 cm broad, heart-shaped or with three shallow, maple-like lobes, green above and below, red conspicuous glands at the base of the leaf, and with a 5.5–26 cm long petiole. The flowers are 2.5–3.5 cm diameter, with five pale pink to purple petals with streaks of darker red or purple in the throat; it is monoecious with individual flowers either male or female, but produced together in the inflorescences. The flowers appear before or with the leaves in loose, terminal clusters. The fruit is a hard, woody pear-shaped berry 4–6 cm long and 3–5 cm diameter, containing four or five large, oily seeds; it is green initially, becoming dull brown when ripe in autumn.

== Cultivation and uses ==
The tung tree is valued for tung oil, which is derived from the seeds of the tree. Tung oil, also called China wood oil or nut oil, has traditionally been used in lamps in China. In modern times, it is used as an ingredient in paint, varnish, and caulk. It is also used as a wood finish for furniture and other wooden objects. After processing to remove gums in the oil, it was also used as a motor fuel. Marco Polo wrote in the 13th century &quot;The Chinese take some lime and chopped hemp, and these they knead together with a certain wood oil; and when the three are thoroughly amalgamated they hold like any glue, and with this mixture they paint their ships&quot;.

It has been introduced to Argentina, Malawi, Paraguay, Thailand, and the United States for oil production. Just before World War I, a number of seeds received from the United States Ambassador to China were planted in California, but the young trees could not take hold in the dry climate.
David Fairchild of the Department of Agriculture successfully introduced the tree in 1905 in the U.S. Gulf States from Florida to Texas. After flourishing from the 1920s to the 1940s the American tung oil industry was wiped out by frost and hurricanes. In 1969, many of the trees were wiped out by Hurricane Camille, and the plantations never recovered. Increased competition from overseas has ended cultivation in the United States and the tree is now listed as an invasive species in Florida.

Global production of the fruit rose from just over 100,000 tonnes in 1970 to almost 200,000 tonnes by 1980. Fruit yields are typically in the range of 4.5–5 tonnes per hectare. A number of cultivars have been selected for increased yield and small tree size, including &#x27;Folsom&#x27;, &#x27;Cahl&#x27;, &#x27;Isabel&#x27;, &#x27;La Crosser&#x27;, and &#x27;Lampton&#x27;.

The wood of the tree is lightweight and strong, and is sometimes used as a substitute for balsa or basswood.

The tung tree is poisonous in all of its parts, including the fruit and the seeds, although some parts of the tree have been used for medicinal purposes in the past. According to the University of Florida Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants, just one seed from the fruit can be fatal, and other symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, and slowed breathing. The leaves can also give a rash similar to that from poison ivy.

== Chemistry ==

The plant contains the coumarinolignoid aleuritin and 5,6,7-trimethoxy coumarin.

<text>Hartlepool ( ) is a seaside and port town in County Durham, England. It is governed by a unitary authority borough named after the town. The borough is part of the devolved Tees Valley area. With an estimated population of 92,600, it is the second-largest settlement in County Durham, after Darlington.

The old town was founded in the 7th century, around the monastery of Hartlepool Abbey on a headland. As the village grew into a town in the Middle Ages, its harbour served as the County Palatine of Durham&#x27;s official port. The new town of West Hartlepool was created in 1835 after a new port was built and railway links from the South Durham coal fields (to the west) and from Stockton-on-Tees (to the south) were created. A parliamentary constituency covering both the old town and West Hartlepool was created in 1867 called The Hartlepools. The two towns were formally merged into a single borough called Hartlepool in 1967. Following the merger, the name of the constituency was changed from The Hartlepools to just Hartlepool in 1974. The modern town centre and main railway station are both at what was West Hartlepool; the old town is now generally known as the Headland.

Industrialisation in northern England and the start of a shipbuilding industry in the later part of the 19th century meant it was a target for the Imperial German Navy at the beginning of the First World War. A bombardment of 1,150 shells on 16 December 1914 resulted in the death of 117 people in the town. A severe decline in heavy industries and shipbuilding following the Second World War caused periods of high unemployment until the 1990s when major investment projects and the redevelopment of the docks area into the Hartlepool Marina saw a rise in the town&#x27;s prospects. The town also has a seaside resort called Seaton Carew.

==History==

The place name derives from Old English &quot;heort&quot; (&quot;hart&quot;), referring to stags seen, and &quot;pōl&quot; (pool), a pool of drinking water which they were known to use. Records of the place-name from early sources confirm this:
* 649: &quot;Heretu, or Hereteu&quot;.
* 1017: &quot;Herterpol, or Hertelpolle&quot;.
* 1182: &quot;Hierdepol&quot;.

===Town on the heugh===

A Northumbrian settlement developed in the 7th century around an abbey founded in 640 by Saint Aidan (an Irish Christian priest) upon a headland overlooking a natural harbour and the North Sea. The monastery became powerful under St Hilda, who served as its abbess from 649 to 657. The 8th-century Northumbrian chronicler Bede referred to the spot on which today&#x27;s town is sited as &quot;the place where deer come to drink&quot;, and in this period the Headland was named by the Angles as &quot;Heruteu&quot; (&quot;Stag Island&quot;). Archaeological evidence has been found below the current high tide mark that indicates that an ancient post-glacial forest by the sea existed in the area at the time.

The Abbey fell into decline in the early 8th century, and it was probably destroyed during a sea raid by Vikings on the settlement in the 9th century. In March 2000, the archaeological investigation television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; located the foundations of the lost monastery in the grounds of St Hilda&#x27;s Church. In the early 11th century, the name had evolved into &quot;Herterpol&quot;.

===Hartness===
During the Norman Conquest, the De Brus family gained over-lordship of the land surrounding Hartlepool. William the Conqueror subsequently ordered the construction of Durham Castle, and the villages under their rule were mentioned in records in 1153 when Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale became Lord of Hartness. The town&#x27;s first charter was received before 1185, for which it gained its first mayor, an annual two-week fair and a weekly market. The Norman Conquest affected the settlement&#x27;s name to form the Middle English &quot;Hart-le-pool&quot; (&quot;The Pool of the Stags&quot;).

By the Middle Ages, Hartlepool was growing into an important (though still small) market town. One of the reasons for its escalating wealth was that its harbour was serving as the official port of the County Palatine of Durham. The main industry of the town at this time was fishing, and Hartlepool in this period established itself as one of the primary ports upon England&#x27;s Eastern coast.

In 1306, Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland, and became the last Lord of Hartness. Angered, King Edward I confiscated the title to Hartlepool, and began to improve the town&#x27;s military defences in expectation of war. In 1315, before they were completed, a Scottish army under Sir James Douglas attacked, captured and looted the town.

In the late 15th century, a pier was constructed to assist in the harbour&#x27;s workload.

===Garrison===

Hartlepool was once again militarily occupied by a Scottish incursion, this time in alliance with the Parliamentary Army during the English Civil War, which after 18 months was relieved by an English Parliamentarian garrison.

In 1795, Hartlepool artillery emplacements and defences were constructed in the town as a defensive measure against the threat of French attack from seaborne Napoleonic forces. During the Crimean War, two coastal batteries were constructed close together in the town to guard against the threat of seaborne attacks from the Imperial Russian Navy. They were entitled the &quot;Lighthouse Battery&quot; (1855) and the &quot;Heugh Battery&quot; (1859).

Hartlepool in the 18th century became known as a town with medicinal springs, particularly the Chalybeate Spa near the Westgate. The poet Thomas Gray visited the town in July 1765 to &quot;take the waters&quot;, and wrote to his friend William Mason:

A few weeks later, he wrote in greater detail to James Brown:
===Town by the strand===

By the early nineteenth century, Hartlepool was still a small town of around 900 people, with a declining port. In 1823, the council and Board of Trade decided that the town needed new industry, so the decision was made to propose a new railway to make Hartlepool a coal port, shipping out minerals from the Durham coalfield. It was in this endeavour that Isambard Kingdom Brunel visited the town in December 1831, and wrote: &quot;A curiously isolated old fishing town – a remarkably fine race of men. Went to the top of the church tower for a view.&quot;

But the plan faced local competition from new docks. to the north, the Marquis of Londonderry had approved the creation of the new Seaham Harbour (opened 31 July 1831), while to the south the Clarence Railway connected Stockton-on-Tees and Billingham to a new port at Port Clarence (opened 1833). Further south again, in 1831 the Stockton and Darlington Railway had extended into the new port of Middlesbrough.

The council agreed the formation of the Hartlepool Dock and Railway Company (HD&amp;RCo) to extend the existing port by developing new docks, and link to both local collieries and the developing railway network in the south. In 1833, it was agreed that Christopher Tennant of Yarm establish the HD&amp;RCo, having previously opened the Clarence Railway (CR). Tennant&#x27;s plan was that the HD&amp;RCo would fund the creation of a new railway, the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway, which would take over the loss-making CR and extended it north to the new dock, thereby linking to the Durham coalfield.

After Tennant died, in 1839, the running of the HD&amp;RCo was taken over by Stockton-on-Tees solicitor, Ralph Ward Jackson. But Jackson became frustrated at the planning restrictions placed on the old Hartlepool dock and surrounding area for access, so bought land which was mainly sand dunes to the south-west, and established West Hartlepool. Because Jackson was so successful at shipping coal from West Hartlepool through his West Hartlepool Dock and Railway Company and, as technology developed, ships grew in size and scale, the new town would eventually dwarf the old town.
The West Hartlepool Harbour and Dock opened on 1 June 1847. On 1 June 1852, the Jackson Dock opened on the same day that a railway opened connecting West Hartlepool to Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. This allowed the shipping of coal and wool products eastwards, and the shipping of fresh fish and raw fleeces westwards, enabling another growth spurt in the town. This in turn resulted in the opening of the Swainson Dock on 3 June 1856, named after Ward Jackson&#x27;s father-in-law. 

In 1878, the William Gray &amp; Co shipyard in West Hartlepool achieved the distinction of launching the largest tonnage of any shipyard in the world, a feat to be repeated on a number of occasions. By 1881, old Hartlepool&#x27;s population had grown from 993 to 12,361, but West Hartlepool had a population of 28,000. Ward Jackson helped to plan the layout of West Hartlepool and was responsible for the first public buildings. He was also involved in the education and the welfare of the inhabitants. In the end, he was a victim of his own ambition to promote the town: accusations of shady financial dealings, and years of legal battles, left him in near-poverty. He spent the last few years of his life in London, far away from the town he had created.

===World Wars===
First

The area became heavily industrialised with an ironworks (established in 1838) and shipyards in the docks (established in the 1870s). By 1913, no fewer than 43 ship-owning companies were located in the town, with the responsibility for 236 ships. This made it a key target for Germany in the First World War. One of the first German offensives against Britain was a raid and bombardment by the Imperial German Navy on the morning of 16 December 1914,

Hartlepool was hit with a total of 1150 shells, killing 117 people. Two coastal defence batteries at Hartlepool returned fire, launching 143 shells, and damaging three German ships: SMS &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, SMS &quot;Moltke&quot; and SMS &quot;Blücher&quot;. The Hartlepool engagement lasted roughly 50 minutes, and the coastal artillery defence was supported by the Royal Navy in the form of four destroyers, two light cruisers and a submarine, none of which had any significant impact on the German attackers.

Private Theophilus Jones of the 18th Battalion Durham Light Infantry, who fell as a result of this bombardment, is sometimes described as the first military casualty on British soil by enemy fire. This event (the death of the first soldiers on British soil) is commemorated by the 1921 Redheugh Gardens War Memorial together with a plaque unveiled on the same day (seven years and one day after the East Coast Raid) at the spot on the Headland (the memorial by Philip Bennison illustrates four soldiers on one of four cartouches and the plaque, donated by a member of the public, refers to the &#x27;first soldier&#x27; but gives no name). A living history group, the Hartlepool Military Heritage Memorial Society, portray men of that unit for educational and memorial purposes.

Hartlepudlians voluntarily subscribed more money per head to the war effort than any other town in Britain.

Between

On 4 January 1922, a fire starting in a timber yard left 80 people homeless and caused over £1,000,000 of damage. Hartlepool suffered badly in the Great Depression of the 1930s and endured high unemployment.

Second

Unemployment decreased during the Second World War, with shipbuilding and steel-making industries enjoying a renaissance. Most of its output for the war effort were &quot;Empire Ships&quot;. German bombers raided the town 43 times, though, compared to the previous war, civilian losses were lighter with 26 deaths recorded by Hartlepool Municipal Borough and 49 by West Hartlepool Borough. During the Second World War, RAF Greatham (also known as RAF West Hartlepool) was located on the South British Steel Corporation Works.

===The merge===

In 1891, the two towns had a combined population of 64,000. By 1900, the two Hartlepools were, together, one of the three busiest ports in England.

The modern town represents a joining of &quot;Old Hartlepool&quot;, locally known as the &quot;Headland&quot;, and West Hartlepool. As already mentioned, what was West Hartlepool became the larger town and both were formally unified in 1967. Today the term &quot;West Hartlepool&quot; is rarely heard outside the context of sport, but one of the town&#x27;s Rugby Union teams still retains the name.

The name of the town&#x27;s professional football club reflected both boroughs; when it was formed in 1908, following the success of West Hartlepool in winning the FA Amateur Cup in 1905, it was called &quot;Hartlepools United&quot; in the hope of attracting support from both towns. When the boroughs combined in 1967, the club renamed itself &quot;Hartlepool&quot; before re-renaming itself Hartlepool United in the 1970s. Many fans of the club still refer to the team as &quot;Pools&quot;

===Postwar period===
After the war, industry went into a severe decline. &quot;Blanchland&quot;, the last ship to be constructed in Hartlepool, left the slips in 1961. In 1967, Betty James wrote how &quot;if I had the luck to live anywhere in the North East [of England]...I would live near Hartlepool. If I had the luck&quot;. There was a boost to the retail sector in 1970 when Middleton Grange Shopping Centre was opened by Princess Anne, with over 130 new shops including Marks &amp; Spencer and Woolworths.

Before the shopping centre was opened, the old town centre was located around Lynn Street, but most of the shops and the market had moved to a new shopping centre by 1974. Most of Lynn Street had by then been demolished to make way for a new housing estate. Only the north end of the street remains, now called Lynn Street North. This is where the Hartlepool Borough Council depot was based (alongside the Focus DIY store) until it moved to the marina in August 2006.

In 1977, the British Steel Corporation announced the closure of its Hartlepool steelworks with the loss of 1500 jobs. In the 1980s, the area was afflicted with extremely high levels of unemployment, at its peak consisting of 30 per cent of the town&#x27;s working-age population, the highest in the United Kingdom. 630 jobs at British Steel were lost in 1983, and a total of 10,000 jobs were lost from the town in the economic de-industrialization of England&#x27;s former Northern manufacturing heartlands. Between 1983 and 1999, the town lacked a cinema and areas of it became afflicted with the societal hallmarks of endemic economic poverty: urban decay, high crime levels, drug and alcohol dependency being prevalent.

Docks near the centre were redeveloped and reopened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993 as a marina. The accompanying National Museum of the Royal Navy opened in 1994, then known as the Hartlepool Historic Quay.

A development corporation is under consultation until August 2022 to organise projects, with the town&#x27;s fund given to the town and other funds. Plans would be (if the corporation is formed) focused on the railway station, waterfront (including the Royal Navy Museum and a new leisure centre) and Church Street. Northern School of Art also has funds for a TV and film studios.

On 2 August 2024 far-right activists and others attacked police, threw stones at a mosque and looted shops after anti-immigrant misinformation was spread on social media.

==Governance==

There is one main tier of local government covering Hartlepool, at unitary authority level: Hartlepool Borough Council. There is a civil parish covering Headland, which forms an additional tier of local government for that area; most of the rest of the urban area is an unparished area. The borough council is a constituent member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Tees Valley Mayor. The borough council is based at the Civic Centre on Victoria Road.

Hartlepool was historically a township in the ancient parish of Hart. Hartlepool was also an ancient borough, having been granted a charter by King John in 1200. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1850. The council built Hartlepool Borough Hall to serve as its headquarters, being completed in 1866.
West Hartlepool was laid out on land outside Hartlepool&#x27;s historic borough boundaries, in the neighbouring parish of Stranton. A body of improvement commissioners was established to administer the new town in 1854. The commissioners were superseded in 1887, when West Hartlepool was also incorporated as a municipal borough. The new borough council built itself a headquarters at the Municipal Buildings on Church Square, which was completed in 1889. An events venue and public hall on Raby Road called West Hartlepool Town Hall was subsequently completed in 1897. In 1902 West Hartlepool was elevated to become a county borough, making it independent from Durham County Council. The old Hartlepool Borough Council amalgamated with West Hartlepool Borough Council in 1967 to form a county borough called Hartlepool.

In 1974 the borough was enlarged to take in eight neighbouring parishes, and was transferred to the new county of Cleveland. Cleveland was abolished in 1996 following the Banham Review, which gave unitary authority status to its four districts, including Hartlepool. The borough was restored to County Durham for ceremonial purposes under the Lieutenancies Act 1997, but as a unitary authority it is independent from Durham County Council.

===Council===

After boundary changes introduced in 2019, the borough is now divided into 12 electoral wards, each of which elects three councillors who make up the 36 councillors of the borough council.

===Members of Parliament===

Hartlepool is represented in the House of Commons by one Member of Parliament. The current MP for the Hartlepool constituency is Jonathan Brash of the Labour Party. He was elected at the 2024 general election with 46.2% of the vote.

Members of Parliament for Hartlepool since 1945 have been:

Mandelson, the MP between 1992 and 2004, resigned to take up a role in the European Commission. On 13 October 2008, he was created Baron Mandelson of Foy and Hartlepool following his appointment as Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform in the British Government.

Engineering related jobs employ around 1700 people. Tata Steel Europe employ around 350 people in the manufacture of steel tubes, predominantly for the oil industry. South of the town on the banks of the Tees, Able UK operates the Teesside Environmental Reclamation and Recycling Centre (TERRC), a large scale marine recycling facility and dry dock. Adjacent to the east of TERRC is the Hartlepool nuclear power station, an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) type nuclear power plant opened in the 1980s. It is the single largest employer in the town, employing 1 per cent of the town&#x27;s working age people.

The chemicals industry is important to the local economy. Companies include Huntsman Corporation, who produce titanium dioxide for use in paints, Omya and Frutarom.

Camerons Brewery was founded in 1852 and currently employs around 145 people. It is one of the largest breweries in the UK. Following a series of take-overs, it came under the control of the Castle Eden Brewery in 2001 who merged the two breweries, closing down the Castle Eden plant. It brews a range of cask and bottled beers, including &quot;Strongarm&quot;, a 4% abv bitter. The brewery is heavily engaged in contract brewing such beers as Kronenbourg 1664, John Smith&#x27;s and Foster&#x27;s.

Orchid Drinks of Hartlepool were formed in 1992 after a management buy out of the soft drinks arm of Camerons. They manufactured Purdey&#x27;s and Amé. Following a £67 million takeover by Britvic, the site was closed down in 2009.

Now owned by PD Ports, the docks are still in use today and still capable of handling large vessels. However, a large portion of the former dockland was converted into a marina capable of berthing 500 vessels. Hartlepool Marina is home to a wide variety of pleasure and working craft, with passage to and from the sea through a lock.

===Rugby union===
Hartlepool is something of an anomaly in England having historically maintained a disproportionate number of clubs in a town of only c.90,000 inhabitants. These include(d) West Hartlepool, Hartlepool Rovers, Hartlepool Athletic RFC, Hartlepool Boys Brigade Old Boys RFC (BBOB), Seaton Carew RUFC (formerly Hartlepool Grammar School Old Boys), West Hartlepool Technical Day School Old Boys RUFC (TDSOB or Tech) and Hartlepool Old Boys&#x27; RFC (Hartlepool). Starting in 1904 clubs within of the headland were eligible to compete for the Pyman Cup which has been contested regularly since and that the Hartlepool &amp; District Union continue to organise.

Perhaps the best known club outside the town is West Hartlepool R.F.C. who in 1992 achieved promotion to what is now the Premiership competing in 1992–93, 1994–95, 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons. This success came at a price as soon after West was then hit by bankruptcy and controversially sold their Brierton Lane stadium and pitch to former sponsor Yuills Homes. There then followed a succession of relegations before the club stabilised in the Durham/Northumberland leagues. West and Rovers continue to play one another in a popular Boxing Day fixture which traditionally draws a large crowd.

Hartlepool Rovers, formed in 1879, who played at the Old Friarage in the Headland area of Hartlepool before moving to West View Road. In the 1890s Rovers supplied numerous county, divisional and international players. The club itself hosted many high-profile matches including the inaugural Barbarians F.C. match in 1890, the New Zealand Maoris in 1888 and the legendary All Blacks who played against a combined Hartlepool Club team in 1905. In the 1911–12 season, Hartlepool Rovers broke the world record for the number of points scored in a season racking up 860 points including 122 tries, 87 conversions, five penalties and eleven drop goals.

Although they ceased competing in the RFU leagues in 2008–09, West Hartlepool TDSOB (Tech) continues to support town and County rugby with several of the town&#x27;s other clubs having played at Grayfields when their own pitches were unavailable. Grayfields has also hosted a number of Durham County cup finals as well as County Under 16, Under 18 and Under 20 age group games.

===Cricket===
Hartlepool Cricket Club play at Park Drive.

===Field hockey===
Hartlepool Caledonians &amp; Billingham Hockey Club is a field hockey club that competes in the Yorkshire and North East Hockey League.

===Olympics===

====Boxing====
At the 2012 Summer Olympics, 21-year-old Savannah Marshall, who attended English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College in the town of Hartlepool, competed in the Women&#x27;s boxing tournament of the 2012 Olympic Games. She was defeated 12–6 by Marina Volnova of Kazakhstan in her opening, quarter-final bout. Savannah Marshall is now a professional boxer, currently unbeaten as a pro and on 31 October 2020 in her 9th professional fight Marshall became the WBO female middleweight champion with a TKO victory over opponent Hannah Rankin at Wembley Arena.

====Swimming====
In August 2012 Jemma Lowe, a British record holder who attended High Tunstall College of Science in the town of Hartlepool, competed in the 2012 Olympic Games. She finished sixth in the 200-metre butterfly final with a time of 58.06 seconds. She was also a member of the eighth-place British team in the 400m Medley relay.

==Monkeys==
Hartlepool is known for allegedly executing a monkey during the Napoleonic Wars. According to legend, fishermen from Hartlepool watched a French warship founder off the coast, and the only survivor was a monkey, which was dressed in French military uniform, presumably to amuse the officers on the ship. The fishermen assumed that this must be what Frenchmen looked like and, after a brief trial, summarily executed the monkey.

Historians have pointed to the prior existence of a Scottish folk song called &quot;And the Boddamers hung the Monkey-O&quot;. It describes how a monkey survived a shipwreck off the village of Boddam near Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. Because the villagers could only claim salvage rights if there were no survivors from the wreck, they allegedly hanged the monkey. There is also an English folk song detailing the later event called, appropriately enough, &quot;The Hartlepool Monkey&quot;. In the English version the monkey is hanged as a French spy.

&quot;Monkey hanger&quot; and Chimp Choker are common terms of (semi-friendly) abuse aimed at &quot;Poolies&quot;, often from footballing rivals Darlington. The mascot of Hartlepool United F.C. is &quot;H&#x27;Angus the monkey&quot;. The man in the monkey costume, Stuart Drummond, stood for the post of mayor in 2002 as H&#x27;angus the monkey, and campaigned on a platform which included free bananas for schoolchildren. To widespread surprise, he won, becoming the first directly elected mayor of Hartlepool, winning 7,400 votes with a 52% share of the vote and a turnout of 30%. He was re-elected by a landslide in 2005, winning 16,912 on a turnout of 51% – 10,000 votes more than his nearest rival, the Labour Party candidate.

The monkey legend is also linked with two of the town&#x27;s sports clubs, Hartlepool Rovers RFC, which uses the hanging monkey as the club logo. Hartlepool (Old Boys) RFC use a hanging monkey kicking a rugby ball as their tie crest.

<text>Dan Flavin (April 1, 1933 – November 29, 1996) was an American minimalist artist famous for creating sculptural objects and installations from commercially available fluorescent light fixtures.

==Early life and career==
Daniel Nicholas Flavin Jr. was born in Jamaica, New York, of Irish Catholic descent, and was sent to Catholic schools. He was named after his father, D. Nicholas Flavin. Dan Flavin studied for the priesthood at the Immaculate Conception Preparatory Seminary in Brooklyn between 1947 and 1952 before leaving to join his twin brother, David John Flavin, and enlist in the United States Air Force.

During military service in 1954–55, Flavin was trained as an air weather meteorological technician and studied art through the adult extension program of the University of Maryland in Korea. Upon his return to New York in 1956, Flavin briefly attended the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts and studied art under Albert Urban. He later studied art history for a short time at the New School for Social Research, then moved on to Columbia University, where he studied painting and drawing.

From 1959, Flavin was briefly employed as a mail room clerk at the Guggenheim Museum and later as guard and elevator operator at the Museum of Modern Art, where he met Sol LeWitt, Lucy Lippard, and Robert Ryman.

== Personal life ==
In 1961, he married his first wife Sonja Severdija, an art history student at New York University and assistant office manager at the Museum of Modern Art. The couple had one son, Stephen Flavin. The first marriage ended in divorce by 1979. Flavin&#x27;s twin brother, David, died in 1962.

Flavin married his second wife, the artist Tracy Harris, in a ceremony at the Guggenheim Museum, in 1992.

Flavin died in Riverhead, New York, of complications from diabetes. A memorial for him was held at Dia Art Foundation on January 23, 1997. Speakers included Brydon Smith, curator of 20th-century art at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; Fariha Friedrich, a Dia Art Foundation trustee; and Michael Venezia, an artist.

==Work==
===Early work===
Flavin&#x27;s first works were drawings and paintings that reflected the influence of Abstract Expressionism. In 1959, he began to make assemblages and mixed media collages that included found objects from the streets, especially crushed cans.

In the summer of 1961, while working as a guard at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, Flavin started to make sketches for sculptures that incorporated electric lights. The first works to incorporate electric light were his &quot;Icons&quot; series: eight colored shallow, boxlike square constructions made from various materials such as wood, Formica, or Masonite. Constructed by the artist and his then-wife Sonja, the &quot;Icons&quot; had fluorescent tubes with incandescent and fluorescent bulbs attached to their sides, and sometimes beveled edges. One of these icons was dedicated to Flavin&#x27;s twin brother David, who died of polio in 1962.

===Mature work===
The &quot;Diagonal of Personal Ecstasy (the Diagonal of May 25, 1963)&quot;, a yellow fluorescent placed on a wall at a 45-degree angle from the floor and completed in 1963, was Flavin&#x27;s first mature work; it is dedicated to Constantin Brâncuși and marks the beginning of Flavin&#x27;s exclusive use of commercially available fluorescent light as a medium. A little later, &quot;The Nominal Three (to William of Ockham)&quot; (1963) consists of six vertical fluorescent tubes on a wall, one to the left, two in the center, three on the right, all emitting white light. He confined himself to a limited palette (red, blue, green, pink, yellow, ultraviolet, and four different whites) and form (straight two-, four-, six-, and eight-foot tubes, and, beginning in 1972, circles). In the decades that followed, he continued to use fluorescent structures to explore color, light and sculptural space, in works that filled gallery interiors. He started to reject studio production in favor of site-specific &quot;situations&quot; or &quot;proposals&quot; (as the artist preferred to classify his work). These structures cast both light and an eerily colored shade, while taking a variety of forms, including &quot;corner pieces&quot;, &quot;barriers,&quot; and &quot;corridors&quot;. Most of Flavin&#x27;s works were untitled, followed by a dedication in parentheses to friends, artists, critics and others: the most famous of these include his &quot;Monuments to V. Tatlin&quot;, a homage to the Russian constructivist sculptor Vladimir Tatlin, a series of a total of fifty pyramidal wall pieces which he continued to work on between 1964 and 1990.

Flavin realized his first full installation piece, greens crossing greens (&quot;to Piet Mondrian who lacked green&quot;), for an exhibition at the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands, in 1966. In 1968 the Heiner Friedrich Gallery in Munich exhibited the light installation &quot;Two primary series and one secondary&quot;, presented in three exhibition rooms, which Flavin developed especially for the gallery. The collector Karl Ströher purchased the installation in the same year. Peter Iden, founding director of the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt acquired the installation together with 86 other works from the former Ströher Collection for the Frankfurt Museum. After a first presentation in 1989, it was shown in various exhibitions at the museum between 1999 and 2002. Flavin himself examined the installation in Frankfurt in February 1993 and then adapted his installation concept for the museum.

Flavin&#x27;s &quot;corridors&quot;, for example, control and impede the movement of the viewer through gallery space. They take various forms: some are bisected by two back-to-back rows of abutted fixtures, a divider that may be approached from either side but not penetrated (the color of the lamps differs from one side to the other). The first such corridor, &quot;untitled (to Jan and Ron Greenberg)&quot;, was constructed for a 1973 solo exhibition at the St. Louis Art Museum, and is dedicated to a local gallerist and his wife. It is green and yellow; a gap (the width of a single &quot;missing&quot; fixture) reveals the cast glow of the color from beyond the divide. In subsequent barred corridors, Flavin would introduce regular spacing between the individual fixtures, thereby increasing the visibility of the light and allowing the colors to mix.

By 1968, Flavin had developed his sculptures into room-size environments of light. That year, he outlined an entire gallery in ultraviolet light at Documenta 4 in Kassel, Germany. In 1992, Flavin&#x27;s original conception for a 1971 piece was fully realized in a site-specific installation that filled the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s entire rotunda on the occasion of the museum&#x27;s reopening.

Flavin generally conceived his sculptures in editions of three or five, but would wait to create individual works until they had been sold to avoid unnecessary production and storage costs. Until the point of sale, his sculptures existed as drawings or exhibition copies. As a result, the artist left behind more than 1,000 unrealized sculptures when he died in 1996.

===Permanent installations===

From 1975, Flavin installed permanent works in Europe and the United States, including &quot;Untitled. In memory of Urs Graf&quot; at the Kunstmuseum Basel (conceived 1972, realized 1975); the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands (1977); Hudson River Museum, Yonkers, New York (1979); United States Courthouse, Anchorage, Alaska (1979–89); the Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, Germany (1989); the lobby of the MetroTech Center (with Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill), Brooklyn, New York (1992); seven lampposts outside the Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, Munich (1994); Hypovereinsbank, Munich (1995); Institut Arbeit und Technik/Wissenschaftspark, Gelsenkirchen, Germany (1996); and the Union Bank of Switzerland, Bern (1996). Additional sites for Flavin&#x27;s architectural &quot;interventions&quot; were the Grand Central Station in New York (1976), Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin (1996), and the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas (2000). His large-scale work in colored fluorescent light for six buildings at the Chinati Foundation was initiated in the early 1980s, although the final plans were not completed until 1996. His last artwork was a site-specific work at Santa Maria Annunciata in Chiesa Rossa, Milan. The 1930s church was designed by Giovanni Muzio. The design for the piece was completed two days before Flavin&#x27;s death on November 29, 1996. Its installation was completed one year later with the assistance of the Dia Center for the Arts and Fondazione Prada.

The Menil Collection in Houston, Texas states that in 1990 Dominique de Menil approached Flavin to create a permanent, site-specific installation at Richmond Hall. Two days before his death in November 1996 Flavin completed the design for the space. The artist&#x27;s studio completed the work.

Dia Bridgehampton, a museum in Bridgehampton, New York opened in 1983 as the Dan Flavin Art Institute. It is run by the Dia Art Foundation and houses nine fluorescent light works by Flavin on permanent display in a gallery designed for them. in 1975 Dia installed &quot;Untitled (In memory of Urs Graf)&quot; at Kunstmuseum Basel as its first permanent installation.

===Drawing===
Living in Wainscott and Garrison, Flavin often drew the surrounding landscape, whether it was the Hudson Valley or the waters off Long Island. He also created small portraits and kept about 20 volumes of journals. Flavin collected drawings too, including works by Hudson River School artists like John Frederick Kensett, Jasper Francis Cropsey, and Sanford Robinson Gifford, along with examples of works on paper by early-19th-century Japanese artists like Hokusai and 20th-century European masters like Piet Mondrian and George Grosz. Flavin also exchanged works with Minimalist colleagues like Donald Judd and Sol LeWitt.

==Exhibitions==
Flavin&#x27;s first one-person exhibition using only fluorescent light opened at the Green Gallery in 1964. Two years later, his first European show opened at Rudolf Zwirner&#x27;s gallery in Cologne, Germany. Favin&#x27;s first major museum exhibition was held in 1967 at the Museum Of Contemporary Art, Chicago, where Jan van der Marck served as director. The first major retrospective of Flavin&#x27;s work was organized by Brydon Smith at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa in 1969. In 1973, the Saint Louis Art Museum presented concurrent exhibitions of his works on paper and fluorescent sculptures. Among Flavin&#x27;s many significant one-person exhibitions in Europe were shows at the Kunstmuseum Basel and Kunsthalle Basel (1975), the Staatliche Kunsthalle, Baden-Baden (1989), and the Städel, Frankfurt (1993).

His first solo exhibition in Latin America was held at Fundación Proa, Buenos Aires, in 1998, organized with the Dia Art Foundation (&quot;Dan Flavin. 1933-96&quot;).

In 2006, Dia Art Foundation, along with the National Gallery of Art, organised a comprehensive exhibition named &quot;Dan Flavin: A Retrospective.&quot; It brought together more than 50 of Flavin&#x27;s artworks.

=== &quot;Dan Flavin: A Retrospective&quot; (2004 – 2007) ===
In the late 1970s, he began a partnership with the Dia Art Foundation that resulted in the making of several permanent site-specific installations and led most recently to the organization of the traveling exhibition, &quot;Dan Flavin: A Retrospective&quot; (2004–2007). Flavin&#x27;s retrospective exhibition traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the Museum of Modern Art, Fort Worth, Texas; Hayward Gallery, London; Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris; Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen, Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles. This exhibition was the first comprehensive retrospective devoted to his minimalist work. The exhibition included nearly 45 light works, including his &quot;icons&quot; series. The MCA&#x27;s presentation included the re-creation of the &quot;alternating pink and &quot;gold&quot;&quot; room from the original MCA exhibition in 1967, Flavin&#x27;s first solo museum exhibition.

==Recognition==
In 1964, Flavin received an award from the William and Norma Copley Foundation, Chicago, with a recommendation from Marcel Duchamp.
In 1973, he was named Albert Dorne Visiting Professor at the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and in 1976, he was given the Skowhegan Medal of Sculpture from Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Maine.

In 1983, the Dia Center for the Arts opened the Dan Flavin Art Institute in Bridgehampton, New York, a permanent exhibition of his works, designed by the artist in a converted firehouse which had served as an African-American church from 1924 through the mid-’70s. Flavin worked closely with architect Richard Gluckman and Jim Schaeufele, Dia&#x27;s director of operations, on the renovation and design. Here, Flavin&#x27;s works are exhibited in &quot;rooms without windows or bearing an indirect relationship to its outside surroundings&quot;. The permanent display consists of nine all-fluorescent pieces, six in color and three dedicated to Schaeufele in three shades of white, as well as a drawing for an icon, not in the temporary exhibition, dedicated to his fraternal twin brother, David John.

In the 2011 film &quot;Tower Heist&quot;, Flavin&#x27;s estate sent an expert to oversee the construction of a Flavin light installation that was recreated on the set.

In 2017, Gallerist Vito Schnabel announced a collaboration with Flavin&#x27;s estate. Schnabel joined the artist&#x27;s son, Stephen Flavin, to present Flavin&#x27;s light sculptures alongside works by European ceramicists admired and collected by Flavin.

==Books about Flavin==
In 2004, Ridinghouse and Thames &amp; Hudson published &quot;It Is What It Is: Dan Flavin Since 1964&quot;, which contains key essays on Flavin and reviews of his exhibitions. It contains the writing of critics and historians such as Donald Judd, Dore Ashton, Rosalind Krauss, Lawrence Alloway, Germano Celant, Holland Cotter.

In 2010, artists Cindy Hinant and Nicolas Guagnini created the book &quot;FLAV&quot;, with primary archival texts and correspondence by and about Dan Flavin.

==Art market==
Each of the more than 750 light sculptures that Dan Flavin designed - usually in editions of three or five - were listed on index cards and filed away. When one sold, the buyer received a certificate containing a diagram of the work, its title and the artist&#x27;s signature and stamp. If someone showed up with a certificate and a damaged fixture, Flavin would replace it.

The highest price by one of his artworks in the art market was reached when &quot;Alternate Diagonals of March 2, 1964 (to Don Judd)&quot; (1964) was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s New York, on 14 May 2014, by $ 3.770.000.

<doc id="325591" wikidata="Q268587" url="?curid=325591" title="Sara Montiel">
<text>María Antonia Abad Fernández (10 March 1928 – 8 April 2013), known professionally as Sara Montiel, also Sarita Montiel, was a Spanish actress and singer. She began her career in the 1940s and became the most internationally popular and highest paid star of Spanish cinema in the 1960s. She appeared in nearly fifty films and recorded around 500 songs in five different languages.

Montiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of La Mancha in 1928. She began her acting career in Spain starring in films such as &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1947) and &quot;Madness for Love&quot; (1948). She moved to Mexico where she starred in films such as &quot;Women&#x27;s Prison&quot; (1951) and &quot;Red Fury&quot; (1951). She then moved to the United States and worked in three Hollywood English-language films &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; (1954), &quot;Serenade&quot; (1956) and &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot; (1957). She returned to Spain to star in the musical films &quot;The Last Torch Song&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Violet Seller&quot; (1958). These two films netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded internationally for films made in the Spanish-speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s and made her immensely popular. She then established herself also as a singer thanks to the songs she performed in her films and combined filming new musical films, recording songs and performing live.

Throughout her career, Montiel&#x27;s personal life was the subject of constant media attention in the Spanish-speaking world. She was married four times and adopted two children.

==Career==
Montiel started in movies at sixteen in her native Spain, where she appeared in a secondary role in her first movie, &quot;Te quiero para mí (I want you for myself)&quot; in 1944, immediately followed by a leading role in &quot;Empezó en boda&quot; (&quot;It Began with a Wedding&quot;) also in 1944. They were followed by roles in films such as &quot;Mariona Rebull&quot; (1946), &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1947) and &quot;Madness for Love&quot; (1948). In April 1950, accompanied by her mother, she moved to Mexico and starred in a dozen films there in less than five years, including &quot;Women&#x27;s Prison&quot; (1951), &quot;Red Fury&quot; (1951) and &quot;Cinnamon Skin&quot; (1953).

Hollywood came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to United States moviegoers in the film &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; (1954), directed by Robert Aldrich. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures, which she refused, afraid of Hollywood&#x27;s typecasting policies for Hispanics. Instead she freelanced at Warner Bros. in &quot;Serenade&quot; (1956), directed by Anthony Mann, whom she married in 1957, and at RKO in Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot; (1957).

Between November 1956 and January 1957, before filming &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot;, she filmed in Barcelona the musical film &quot;The Last Torch Song&quot; during a vacation in Spain and as a deference to its director Juan de Orduña. The film, that was filmed with a very low budget, became unexpectedly a worldwide megahit. Initially, the songs in the film were going to be sung by a professional singer who would dub Montiel, but due to the low budget, she eventually sang the songs herself. The film soundtrack album also became a hit.

Following this success, in June 1957 she signed with producer Benito Perojo a lavish contract to make four films in three years, being the first of them &quot;The Violet Seller&quot;, a 1958 large-budget international co-production musical film. The economic agreement was ten million pesetas (US$240,000 as of 1957) for four films, which means that she was to receive 2.5 million pesetas (US$60,000) per film, making her the highest-paid Spanish star at a time when the highest-paid stars were netting one million pesetas (US$24,000) per film. The success of &quot;The Violet Seller&quot; surpassed that of &quot;The Last Torch Song&quot;, and in a contractual dispute for the next film, &quot;A Girl Against Napoleon&quot; (1959), the agreement was improved by securing for her the twenty per cent of the producer&#x27;s net revenue. She also signed a contract with Hispavox to record and release the soundtrack albums of her films for which she netted the ten per cent of the records sale as royalties. &quot;The Violet Seller&quot; soundtrack album, the first with them, topped sales in Spain and in Latin America and, in July 1959, Hispavox served a Golden Disk award to her for the number of records sold there.

All this made her a film and singing international superstar. Almost all of her next films earned high box office results and she combined filming, recording songs and performing live. She was the highest paid star of Spanish cinema, and many years later, she began to say that she had been paid more than US$1 million for each of these films, something that the press widely reported as the actual figure. Among the next films during the 1960s and early 1970s were &quot;My Last Tango&quot; (1960), &quot;Pecado de amor&quot; (1961), &quot;The Lovely Lola&quot; (a 1962 version of &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot;), &quot;Casablanca, Nest of Spies&quot; (1963), &quot;Samba&quot; (1964), &quot;The Lost Woman&quot; (1966), &quot;Tuset Street&quot; (1967), &quot;Esa Mujer&quot; (1969) and &quot;Variety&quot; (1971). The film &quot;Variety&quot; was banned in Beijing in 1973.

In 1974, she announced her retirement from movies, as she become dissatisfied with the movie industry and the overt nudity in films, but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in Spain. In 2002 she was the advertising image of the MTV Europe Music Awards held in Barcelona.

In November 2009, singer Alaska who forms the Spanish pop group Fangoria with Nacho Canut, invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band&#x27;s album &quot;Absolutamente&quot;. They recorded the title track &quot;Absolutamente&quot; as a duet. The music video for the song was released on 18 December 2009. Well into her eighties, she had no plans to retire, and continued working in various projects. In May 2011, after almost forty years without making a movie, she performed in a feature film directed by Óscar Parra de Carrizosa. The film title is &quot;Abrázame&quot; and was shot on location in La Mancha.

She is considered &quot;one of the most important actresses in the history of Spain&quot;, and has been described by Spain&#x27;s press as a &quot;myth of Spanish cinema.&quot; She has also been characterized as &quot;the most beautiful woman of twentieth century Spain.&quot; She has also been called a &quot;sexual, feminist, and gay icon for Francoist Spain.&quot;

==Personal life==

Montiel, whose complete name was María Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fernández, was born in 1928 in Campo de Criptana (Ciudad Real), Spain. She entered films after winning a talent contest at age fifteen. In her first movie, she was credited as &quot;María Alejandra&quot; a shortened version of her real name. For her next film, she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the Montiel fields in La Mancha region of her birth. It was in Mexico where she first learned how to read and write, taught by the poet León Felipe, and in 1951 she acquired Mexican dual nationality. She was married four times, and was ex-communicated by the Catholic Church in Spain for the civil-wedding ceremony of her first marriage:

* Anthony Mann (American actor, film director); 1957–63 (divorced)
* José Vicente Ramírez Olalla (attorney); 1964–70 (divorced)
* José Tous Barberán (attorney, journalist); 1979–92 (Tous&#x27;s death); this union produced two adopted children: Thais (born 1979) and José Zeus (born 1983)
* Antonio Hernández (Cuban videotape operator); 2002–05 (divorced)

In 2000, Montiel published her autobiography &quot;Memories: To Live Is a Pleasure&quot;, written by playwright Pedro Víllora, an instant best seller with ten editions to date. A sequel &quot;Sara and Sex&quot; followed in 2003. In these books, she revealed other relationships in her past, including one-night stands with writer Ernest Hemingway as well as actor James Dean. She also claimed a long-term affair in the 1940s with playwright Miguel Mihura and mentioned that scientist Severo Ochoa, a Nobel Prize winner, was the true love of her life.

In her later years, she became an iconic figure to the gay community, and noted &quot;Cuando voy a actuar a alguna ciudad de EE UU allí están todos los gays de la ciudad&quot; (Whenever I perform in any city in the US, all the gays from that city show up). Montiel died in 2013 at her home in Madrid at the age of eighty-five from congestive heart failure, and was buried in the San Justo Cemetery in Madrid.

==Legacy==
===Museum===
The Sara Montiel Museum, opened in 1991, is a museum in Campo de Criptana dedicated to her. It is housed in a sixteenth century windmill and displays photographs, wardrobe and personal belongings of the actress as well as posters of her films. In May 2021 it reopened after undergoing a restoration and modernization.

===In popular culture===

Correos, the Spanish postal service, issued in 2014 a sheet of stamps in tribute to three recently deceased famous Spanish cinema artists: Sara Montiel, Alfredo Landa and Manolo Escobar. The stamp that pays tribute to Montiel depicts her in a scene from &quot;The Violet Seller&quot;.

She was portrayed in the Pedro Almodóvar film &quot;Bad Education&quot; (2004) by a male actor in drag (Gael García Bernal) as the cross-dressing character Zahara, and a film clip from one of her movies was used, as well.

==Notes==

: a. In Spain, ten million pesetas (€60,101) in 1957, adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index, in 2022 would be approximately €3 million, while its purchasing power would be €10–16 million.
: b. The exchange rate in June 1957 was of forty-two pesetas to the United States dollar.

<doc id="325593" wikidata="Q5746302" url="?curid=325593" title="Hester Grenville, 1st Countess Temple">
<text>Hester Grenville, 1st Countess Temple, 2nd Viscountess Cobham (&quot;née&quot; Temple; bapt. 7 May 1684 – 6 October 1752) was an English noblewoman. She was the mother and grandmother of the Prime Ministers George Grenville and William Grenville.

==Life and family==
She was the daughter (and eventual co-heir) of Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Bt. (1634–1697), of Stowe, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Mary Knapp.

Hester married Richard Grenville of Wotton in Buckinghamshire on 25 November 1710, and became the mother of five sons, all of whom served as members of parliament:

* Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple (1711–1779), MP.
* George Grenville (1712–1770), MP; was Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1763 to 1765. He married Elizabeth Wyndham and had children. (George&#x27;s son, William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, also became prime minister.)
* James Grenville (1715–1783), MP; served as a minister under his brother-in-law William Pitt the Younger. He married Mary Smyth and had children.
* Henry Grenville (1717–1784), MP; married Margaret Eleanor Banks and had children.
* Thomas Grenville (1719–1747), MP; a Royal Navy officer, who died at sea, aged 28, unmarried.

Her daughter, Hester (1720–1803), was the wife of William Pitt the Elder and mother of William Pitt the Younger, who both became prime minister.

Hester was the sister of Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham, whose title she inherited under a special remainder in 1749; on 18 October of the same year, her husband being long dead, she was created 1st Countess Temple. Lord Cobham had excluded from succession his nephews Temple West and Gilbert West (who were sons of his elder sister Maria and Richard West), and also his other sister Penelope.

<text>Adrian Willaert ( – 7 December 1562) was a Flemish composer of High Renaissance music. Mainly active in Italy, he was the founder of the Venetian School. He was one of the most representative members of the generation of northern composers who moved to Italy and transplanted the polyphonic Franco-Flemish style there.

== Life ==
He was born at Rumbeke near Roeselare or Bruges. According to his student, the renowned 16th century music theorist Gioseffo Zarlino, Willaert went to Paris first to study law, but instead decided to study music. In Paris he met Jean Mouton, the principal composer of the French royal chapel and stylistic compatriot of Josquin des Prez, and studied with him.

Sometime around 1515 Willaert first went to Rome. An anecdote survives that indicates the musical ability of the young composer: Willaert was surprised to discover the choir of the papal chapel singing one of his own compositions, most likely the six-part motet &quot;Verbum bonum et suave&quot;, and even more surprised to learn that they thought it had been written by the much more famous composer Josquin. When he informed the singers of their error – that he was in fact the composer – they refused to sing it again. Indeed, Willaert&#x27;s early style is very similar to that of Josquin, with smooth polyphony, balanced voices and frequent use of imitation or strict canon. Indeed, the early Willaert admired Josquin so much that he wrote a mass, Missa Mente Tota, in double canon throughout with two free voices, based upon a movement of a famous Josquin motet (&quot;Vultum tuum deprecabuntur&quot;).

In July 1515, Willaert entered the service of Cardinal Ippolito I d&#x27;Este of Ferrara. Willaert likely accompanied Ippolito on his travels to various places, including Hungary, where Ippolito resided from 1517 to 1519. Following Ippolito&#x27;s death in 1520, Willaert entered the service of Duke Alfonso I of Ferrara. In 1522 Willaert had a post at the court chapel of Duke Alfonso; he remained there until 1525, at which time records show he was in the employ of Ippolito II d&#x27;Este.

Willaert&#x27;s most significant appointment came with his selection in 1527 as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of St. Mark&#x27;s at Venice. The Venetian Doge Andrea Gritti had a rather large hand in Willaert&#x27;s appointment to the position of maestro di cappella at St. Mark&#x27;s.

From his appointment in 1527 until his death in 1562, Willaert retained the post at St. Mark&#x27;s. Composers came from all over Europe to study with him , and his standards were high both for singing and composition. During his previous employment with the dukes of Ferrara, he had acquired numerous contacts and influential friends elsewhere in Europe, including the Sforza family in Milan ; doubtless this assisted in the spread of his reputation, and the consequent importation of musicians from foreign countries into northern Italy. In Ferrarese court documents, Willaert is referred to as &quot;Adriano Cantore&quot;. In addition to his output of sacred music as the director of St. Mark&#x27;s, he wrote numerous madrigals, a secular form; he is considered a Flemish madrigal composer of the first rank.

== Musical style and influence ==
Willaert was one of the most versatile composers of the Renaissance, writing music in almost every extant style and form. In force of personality, and with his central position as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s, he became the most influential musician in Europe between the death of Josquin and the time of Palestrina.
Some of Willaert&#x27;s motets and &quot;&quot; (double canonic chansons) had been published as early as 1520 in Venice. Willaert owes much of his fame in sacred music to his motets.
According to Gioseffo Zarlino, writing later in the 16th century, Willaert was the inventor of the antiphonal style from which the polychoral style of the Venetian school evolved. As there were two choir lofts – one to each side of the main altar of St. Mark&#x27;s, both provided with an organ —, Willaert divided the choral body into two sections, using them either antiphonally or simultaneously. De Rore, Zarlino, Andrea Gabrieli, Donato, and Croce, Willaert&#x27;s successors, all cultivated this style. The tradition of writing that Willaert established during his time at St. Mark&#x27;s was continued by other composers working there throughout the 17th century. He then composed and performed psalms and other works for two alternating choirs. This innovation met with instantaneous success and strongly influenced the development of the new method. In Venice, a compositional style, established by Willaert, for multiple choirs dominated. In 1550 he published &quot;Salmi spezzati&quot;, antiphonal settings of the psalms, the first polychoral work of the Venetian school. Willaert&#x27;s work in the religious genre established Flemish techniques firmly as an important part of the Venetian Style. While more recent research has shown that Willaert was not the first to use this antiphonal, or polychoral method — Dominique Phinot had employed it before Willaert, and Johannes Martini even used it in the late 15th century – Willaert&#x27;s polychoral settings were the first to become famous and widely imitated.

With his contemporaries, Willaert developed the &quot;canzone&quot; (a form of polyphonic secular song) and &quot;ricercare&quot;, which were forerunners of modern instrumental forms. Willaert also arranged 22 four-part madrigals for voice and lute written by Verdelot. In an early 4-part vocal work, &quot;Quid non-ebrietas?&quot; (In some sources called the &quot;Chromatic Duo&quot;) Willaert uses musica ficta around the circle of 5ths in one of the voices resulting in an augmented 7th in unison with the ending octave, an outstanding experiment with chromatic enharmonicism. Willaert was among the first to extensively use chromaticism in the madrigal. Looking forward, we are given an image of early word painting in his madrigal &quot;Mentre che&#x27;l cor&quot;. Willaert, who was fond of the older compositional techniques such as the canon, often placed the melody in the tenor of his compositions, treating it as a cantus firmus. Willaert, with the help of De Rore, standardized a five-voice setting in madrigal composition. Willaert also pioneered a style that continued until the end of the madrigal period of reflecting the emotional qualities of the text and the meanings of important words as sharply and clearly as possible.

Willaert was no less distinguished as a teacher than as a composer. Among his disciples were Cipriano de Rore, his successor at St. Mark&#x27;s; Costanzo Porta; the Ferrarese Francesco Viola; Gioseffo Zarlino; and Andrea Gabrieli. Another composer stylistically descended from Willaert was Lassus. These composers, except for Lassus, formed the core of what came to be known as the Venetian school, which was decisively influential on the stylistic change that marked the beginning of the Baroque era. Among Willaert&#x27;s pupils in Venice, one of the most prominent was his fellow northerner Cipriano de Rore. The Venetian School flourished for the rest of the 16th century, and into the 17th, led by the Gabrielis and others. Willaert also probably influenced a young Palestrina. Willaert left a large number of compositions – 8 (or possibly 10) masses, over 50 hymns and psalms, over 150 motets, about 60 French chansons, over 70 Italian madrigals and 17 instrumental (ricercares).

<text>Köräş (also kuresh, koresh, küreş, güreş and similar variants) refers to a number of folk wrestling styles practiced in Central Asia. 

Köräş wrestlers (Turkish:Güreş, &quot;köräşçelär&quot;; , &quot;küreščiler&quot;) use towels to hold their opponents, and their goal is to throw their opponents off the feet. The wrestling is the main competition at the folk festival Sabantuy. 

The sport is called &#x27; in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]],&#x27; in Bashkir, &#x27; in [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]],&#x27; in Kazakh, &#x27; in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]],&#x27; in Shor, &#x27; in [[Tatar language|Tatar]],&#x27; in Turkish, &#x27; in [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], and&#x27; in Uzbek, all derived from Old Turkic &quot;küreş&quot;.
==History==
The first official All-USSR koresh championship took place in Kazan in 1928 and was followed by the first TASSR (Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) national championship in 1949. Since 1956, regular Tatar Köräş competitions have been organized in honor of the national hero and poet Musa Cälil.

At the turn of 1950 and 1960, the Soviet &quot;Federation of freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, and sambo&quot; started to develop Tatar Köräş. Sportsmen from the neighbour regions, such as Bashkortostan, Mordovia, and Ulyanovsk City came to compete in Kazan for the first time in 1959. In 1960, the capital of Tatarstan was appointed host of the first RSFSR (Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) national koresh championship, an event that has been repeated every year since that date. It was organized in Kazan about 15 times, but also in other cities, such as Salavat, Orenburg, Oktyabrsky, Tuymazy, Chelyabinsk, Cheboksary, Almetievsk, Samara, Ulyanovsk, Naberezhnye Chelny. Sportsmen from 36 Russian regions have participated in the Russian championships over the past years.

==Events==
The International Kurash Association (IKA), founded in 1998, holds championships since 1999. World Senior championships were held in Tashkent (Uzbekistan) in 1999, in Antalya (Turkey) in 2000, in Budapest (Hungary) in 2001, in Yerevan (Armenia) in 2002, in Tashkent (Uzbekistan) in 2005, in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia) in 2007, in Alushta (Ukraine) in 2009, in Termez (Uzbekistan) in 2011, in Istanbul (Turkey) in 2013, and in Khorramabad (Iran) in 2015. The XI World Senior Championships will be held in Istanbul (Turkey) in 2017.

The International Tatar Belt Wrestling Köräş Association was founded on 9 September 2009 with the aim of popularizing Tatar traditions abroad and offer Continental and World opportunities to all sportsmen wishing to compete in Tatar Köräş. It became a member of FILA&#x27;s World Traditional Wrestling Committee in 2009 and held its second World Championship during the FILA World Wrestling Games that took place in Šiauliai (LTU) in September 2009. The third World Championship was held in Kazan in May 2010 and attracted a participation of about 100 wrestlers from 17 countries.

Kurash made its debut at the 2018 Asian Games which was held in Jakarta and Palembang, Indonesia. It also made its debut at the 30th Southeast Asian Games hosted by the Philippines in 2019.

=== World Junior Kurash Championships (U20) ===


==Kurash rules==

Contestants attempt to score (and finish the match) with high amplitude throws. The trousers or legs may not be grabbed.

There are three scoring points viz. Halal, Yonbosh and Chala. The player who scores a Halal wins the fight. To score a Halal you need to throw your opponent on his back with full control, force and speed. The throw that is close to Halal is given Yonbosh. Two Yonbosh throws make a Halal. The throw that is close to Yonbosh is called Chala. No number of Chala can equal a Yonbosh. There are three penalties in Kurash. The first penalty is called Tanbekh, second penalty is Dakki and the third penalty is Gʻirrom which means disqualification. The fight starts with salutation which is called Ta&#x27;zim. And to pause the bout Tokhta is used and to cancel a point Bekar is used.

<text>The Nyland Brigade (, ) is a brigade-level marine-type unit of the Finnish Navy stationed in Dragsvik in Raseborg in the province of Uusimaa. The brigade trains coastal jaegers and other troops for combat in coastal environments. It is the only unit of the Finnish Defence Forces where the instruction language is Swedish, one of the country&#x27;s national languages alongside Finnish. The command language is, however, Finnish.

The brigade also trains personnel for the international ATU unit (amphibious task unit), which is a special crisis management force that can be employed in coastal environments.

==Organization==
* Headquarters
* Vasa Coastal Jaeger Battalion
**1st Coastal Jaeger Company
**2nd Coastal Jaeger Company
**Combat Boat Company
* Ekenäs Coastal Battalion
**Mortar Company
**Headquarters and Signal Company
**Combat Engineer Company
* Logistics Center

The Vasa Coastal Jaeger Battalion trains coastal jaegers, boatsmen, coastal missile troops, reconnaissance troops and ATU platoons. The Ekenäs Coastal Battalion trains mortar and signal troops, military policemen, chauffeurs, supply specialists and combat engineers.

==History==

The brigade follows the traditions of the Nyland and Tavastehus Cavalry Regiment, which Gustavus Adolphus established in 1626. The regiment distinguished itself in the Battle of Siikajoki during the Finnish War. The brigade also traces back its history to the 3rd Jaeger Regiment during the Finnish Civil War, renamed Uusimaa Regiment during the interwar period. After the Winter War, the Uusimaa Regiment was one of the units forming the new 13th Brigade, which formed the basis of the 13th Infantry Regiment (JR13) during the Continuation War, later called the 4th Infantry Regiment, which was restructured to form the 4th Brigade and renamed to Nyland Brigade in 1957. The unit became a part of the Finnish Navy in 1998, having been an Army unit until then.

==Equipment==
The brigade utilizes XA-185 Pasi APCs and trucks for land transport, and &quot;Jehu&quot;, &quot;Jurmo&quot;, &quot;Uisko&quot; and &quot;G&quot; class landing craft for amphibious transport. The motorized artillery previously used 130 K 54 guns, but now relies on Spike-ER missiles for anti-ship warfare.

<text>Charles Henry Buckius Demuth (November 8, 1883 – October 23, 1935) was an American painter who specialized in watercolors and turned to oils late in his career, developing a style of painting known as Precisionism.

&quot;Search the history of American art,&quot; wrote Ken Johnson in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;and you will discover few watercolors more beautiful than those of Charles Demuth. Combining exacting botanical observation and loosely Cubist abstraction, his watercolors of flowers, fruit and vegetables have a magical liveliness and an almost shocking sensuousness.&quot;

Demuth was a lifelong resident of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The home he shared with his mother is now the Demuth Museum, which showcases his work. He graduated from Franklin &amp; Marshall Academy before studying at Drexel University and at Philadelphia&#x27;s Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. While he was a student at PAFA, he participated in a show at the academy, and also met William Carlos Williams at his boarding house. The two were fast friends and remained close for the rest of their lives.

He later studied at Académie Colarossi and Académie Julian in Paris, where he became a part of the avant garde art scene. The Parisian artistic community was accepting of Demuth&#x27;s homosexuality. After his return to America, Demuth retained aspects of Cubism in many of his works.

==Early life==
Charles Demuth was born on 8 November 1883 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1889, when Demuth was 6 years old, his family moved to an 18th-century house at 120 East King Street. In the colonial period, the house had been a tavern. Demuth&#x27;s Tobacco Shop, owned and run by his family since 1770, was next door. Demuth lived at the King Street house with his mother, Augusta for the rest of his life. He maintained a small studio on the second floor.

Throughout his career, Demuth remained deeply attached to Lancaster. The city&#x27;s modest commercial and civic architecture was the subject of hundreds of his watercolors and paintings. His depictions of warehouses, factories and row houses imbue these ordinary structures (sometimes ironically) with a grandeur and glamor normally associated with cathedrals, palaces and temples. For example, his image of two Lancaster grain silos, titled &quot;My Egypt&quot; (1927), invites the viewer to compare the massive volumetric forms to pharaonic monuments like the pyramids. In 1907 he painted his first self-portrait in oil. Demuth attended Franklin and Marshall College and later pursued graduate study in art in Philadelphia.

Demuth either suffered an injury when he was four years old, or may have had polio or tuberculosis of the hip, leaving him with a marked limp and requiring him to use a cane. He later developed diabetes and was one of the first people in the United States to receive insulin as a treatment. Demuth pronounced his surname with emphasis upon the first syllable, earning him the nickname &quot;Deem&quot; among close friends. From 1909 onward, Demuth maintained a romantic relationship with Robert Evans Locher, an Art Deco interior decorator and stage designer.

==Career==

While he was in Paris he met Marsden Hartley by walking up to a table of American artists and asking if he could join them. He had a great sense of humor, rich in double entendres, and they asked him to be a regular member of their group. Through Hartley, he met Alfred Stieglitz and became a member of the Stieglitz group. In 1926, he had a one-man show at the Anderson Galleries and another at Intimate Gallery, the New York gallery run by Stieglitz. Demuth was introduced to modernism during trips to Europe between 1907 and 1921. On frequent trips to New York City, he encountered avant-garde styles and ideas, most notably Cubism, the influence of which is reflected in many of his works.
His most famous painting, &quot;I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold,&quot; was inspired by his friend William Carlos Williams&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot;. Roberta Smith described the work in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Demuth&#x27;s famous visionary accounting of Williams, &quot;I Saw the Figure Five in Gold&quot;, [is] a painting whose title and medallion-like arrangement of angled forms were both inspired by a verse the poet wrote after watching a fire engine streak past him on a rainy Manhattan street while waiting for Marsden Hartley, whose studio he was visiting, to answer his door.&quot; Describing its importance, Judith H. Dobrzynski in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s the best work in a genre Demuth created, the &#x27;poster portrait&#x27;. It&#x27;s a witty homage to his close friend, the poet William Carlos Williams, and a transliteration into paint of his poem, &#x27;The Great Figure&#x27;. It&#x27;s a decidedly American work made at a time when U.S. artists were just moving beyond European influences. It&#x27;s a reference to the intertwined relationships among the arts in the 1920s, a moment of cross-pollination that led to American Modernism. And it anticipates pop art.&quot;

The work is one of 10 poster portraits Demuth intended to create to honor his creative friends. The six completed ones were in homage to Williams plus Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Charles Duncan, John Marin and Bert Savoy. The others were planned for Marsden Hartley, Gertrude Stein, Eugene O&#x27;Neill and Wallace Stevens. Painted during a period of recovery from illness, these paintings portray their respective painters and writers and performers through referential objects and language, as opposed to literal depictions. These works proved to be a challenge for critics. One reviewer described the works as having been made in “a code for which we have not the key.”

Demuth, along with Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and Charles Sheeler, was a major contributor to the Precisionist art movement, which began to evolve in America around 1915. Demuth&#x27;s works often depicted a specific range of forms in a quasi-Cubist, sharply defined manner, a characteristic of Precisionism. Frequently occurring scenes within Demuth&#x27;s works are urban and rural landscapes, often consisting of industrial features such as bridges, smoke stacks, and skyscrapers. Demuth&#x27;s &quot;Aucassin and Nicolette,&quot; which can be viewed below, is an exemplary work of Precisionist art. Notable features include the highly structured scene lacking figures, depiction of an industrial setting, and sharp linearity created by geometric figures with no hint of abstraction. Demuth&#x27;s works of this nature have been perceived as ironic and pessimistic in light of their subject matter.

Demuth began a series of paintings in 1919, inspired by the architecture of Lancaster. In creating these works, Demuth opted not to use watercolors, instead created the works in oil and tempera. Additionally, these works are larger than many of his others. They possess a balance between realism and abstraction. In 1927, Demuth started a series of seven panel paintings depicting factory buildings in his hometown. He finished the last of the seven, &quot;After All&quot; in 1933. Six of the paintings were highlighted in &quot;Chimneys and Towers: Charles Demuth’s Late Paintings of Lancaster&quot;, a 2007 Amon Carter Museum retrospective of his work, displayed in 2008 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. According to the exhibit notes from the Amon Carter show, Demuth&#x27;s will left many of his paintings to Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. Her strategic decisions regarding which museums received these works cemented his reputation as a major painter of the Precisionist school.

==Later years and death==
Demuth, a gay artist, was a regular patron at the Lafayette Baths. His sexual exploits there are the subject of watercolors, including his 1918 homoerotic self-portrait set in a Victorian Turkish bath.

Demuth spent most of his life in frail health. By 1920, the effects of diabetes had begun to severely drain Demuth of artistic energy. He died at his residence in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania at the age 51 of complications from diabetes. He is buried at the Lancaster Cemetery.
