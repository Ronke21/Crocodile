<text>The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) is a British breed of toy dog of spaniel type. Four colours are recognised: Blenheim (chestnut and white), tricolour (black/white/tan), black and tan, and ruby; the coat is smooth and silky. The lifespan is usually between eight and twelve years.

The Cavalier King Charles changed dramatically in the late seventeenth century, when it was inter-bred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, it shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration – a dog resembling Charles II&#x27;s spaniel of the English Civil War period, when supporters of the king were known as Cavaliers.

==History==

During the early part of the 18th century, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke recorded that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.

Attempts were made to recreate the original Cavalier King Charles Spaniel as early as the turn of the 20th century, using the now extinct Toy Trawler Spaniels. These attempts were documented by Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, in the book &quot;Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians&quot; published under the name of the &quot;Hon. Mrs. Neville Lytton&quot; in 1911.

===Divergence from King Charles Spaniel===
In 1926, the American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of 25 pounds of sterling silver each as a prize for the best male and females of &quot;Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England&#x27;s time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull.&quot; The breeders of the era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed. The first standard was created, based on a dog named &quot;Ann&#x27;s Son&quot; owned by Mostyn Walker, and the Kennel Club recognised the variety as &quot;King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type&quot;.

The Second World War caused a drastic setback to the emerging breed, with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of 60 dogs dropped to three during the 1940s. Following the war, few dogs survived as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend. And in 1945, the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown who, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA that continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. It was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 15th most popular pure-breed in the United States.

==Description==

Historically the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was a lap dog and is small for a spaniel, with fully grown adults comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. The tail is usually not docked, and the Cavalier should have a silky coat of moderate length. Standards state that it should be free from curl, although a slight wave is allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed&#x27;s features.

The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can often be confused with each other. In the United Kingdom, the English Toy Spaniel is called the King Charles Spaniel, while in the United States, one of the colours of the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles. The two breeds share similar history and only diverged from each other about 100 years ago. There are several major differences between the two breeds, with the primary difference being size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between , the King Charles is smaller at . In addition, their facial features, while similar, are different; the Cavalier&#x27;s ears are set higher and its skull is flat, while the King Charles&#x27;s skull is domed. Finally, the muzzle length of the Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin.

===Colour===
The breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers that have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honor of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough raised for assistance in hunting the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some Blenheim dogs there is a chestnut spot in the middle of the forehead: this is called the &quot;Blenheim&quot; spot. The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the &quot;Duchess Thumb Print&quot;, based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband&#x27;s safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb, resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won.

Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail. Black and Tan is referred to as &quot;King Charles&quot; in the King Charles Spaniel.

Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut, although some can have some white in their coats that is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules.

The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears, on eyebrows, inside legs, and on underside of tail. This colour is referred to as &quot;Prince Charles&quot; in the King Charles Spaniel.
===Popularity===
According to statistics released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the 6th most popular dog in the United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year. Their popularity is on the rise in America; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular. They ranked higher in some individual US cities in the 2008 statistics: 8th in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul, 7th in Boston, Atlanta and Washington D.C., and 6th in both New York City and San Francisco. The breed&#x27;s popularity has continued to grow, ranking in 14th place in 2022.

In 2009, the Cavalier was the 4th most popular breed in Australia with 3,196 registrations, behind only Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherd Dogs and Staffordshire Bull Terriers. In addition, there are also national breed clubs in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. Today, Cavaliers are becoming a popular choice in cross breeding and are bred with other dogs such as poodles, though it should be acknowledged that these breeds are not purebred dogs eligible for registration under the AKC.

Cavaliers were among the pets of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, known for his Blenheim Cavalier named Rex. Cavaliers were also the dog of choice for Queen Victoria.

==Temperament==

The breed is highly affectionate, playful, extremely patient and eager to please. As such, dogs of the breed are good with children and other dogs. Cavaliers are not shy about socialising with much larger dogs. They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location and suit city and country life. Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.

Cavaliers are active and sporting. Cavaliers are successful in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.
They have an instinct to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets, and so most Cavaliers will never become &quot;street-wise&quot;. As they tend to regard all strangers as friends, members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs. Spaniels have a strong hunting instinct and may endanger birds and small animals. However, owners have reported that through training their Cavaliers live happily with a variety of small animals including hamsters and gerbils.

The Cavalier&#x27;s coat requires weekly brushing, but no trimming. However, some owners prefer to trim their Cavalier&#x27;s long feathers and slippers that can become very dirty when walking or playing outside.

==Health==
A 2022 UK study of veterinary data found a life expectancy of 10.45 years compared to 11.82 for crossbreeds. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.
A 2018 Japanese study of pet cemetery data found a life expectancy of 13.1 years compared to 15.1 for crossbreeds and 13.7 overall. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 10 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall. A 2005 Swedish study of insurance records found 48% of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels died by the age of 10, higher than the overall rate at 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.

Cavaliers can notably be prone to mitral valve disease, which leads to heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers at some point in their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, including early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today&#x27;s Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. Additionally, bad breeding increases the chance that a Cavalier will develop MVD, so it is important to find a responsible breeder who uses dogs with healthy hearts. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia. Cavaliers are also affected by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniels of various types, and they can have such other general conditions as hip dysplasia, which are common across many types of dog breeds.

In 2022, the Oslo District Court banned the breeding of Cavalier King Charles spaniels in Norway due to their propensity for developing health problems. In its verdict the court judged that no dog of this breed could be considered healthy, therefore using them for breeding would be a violation of Norway&#x27;s Animal Welfare Act.

===Mitral valve disease===
Nearly all Cavaliers eventually have mitral valve disease, with heart murmurs that may progressively worsen, leading to heart failure. This condition is polygenic (affected by multiple genes), and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible. It is the leading cause of death in the breed. A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8% of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related. The next most common causes are cancer (12.3%) and old age (12.2%). The condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age 5. It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not to have a heart murmur. While heart disease is common in dogs generally – one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems – mitral valve disease is generally (as in humans) a disease of old age. The &quot;hinge&quot; on the heart&#x27;s mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate, along with the valve&#x27;s flaps, causing a heart murmur (as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats) then congestive heart failure. The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease, which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age.

Veterinary geneticists and cardiologists have developed breeding guidelines to eliminate early-onset mitral valve disease in the breed, but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines. The chairperson of the UK CKCS Club said in 2009: &quot;There are many members who are still not prepared to health check their breeding stock, and of those who do, it would appear that many would not hesitate to breed from affected animals.&quot; The MVD breeding protocol recommends that parents should be at least 2.5 years old and heart clear, and their parents (i.e., the puppy&#x27;s grandparents) should be heart clear until age 5.

===Syringomyelia===

Syringomyelia (SM) is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It is caused by a malformation, commonly known as Chiari Malformation, in the lower back of the skull that reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid&#x27;s pressure, creating turbulence that in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples in the past few years consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30 and 70% have syrinxes. However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic. Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. Scratching is often unilateral – restricted to one side of the body. Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body (&quot;air scratching&quot;). The scratching behaviour appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking – without stopping – in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching (&quot;bunny hopping&quot;). Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on a leash, or is excited, and first thing in the morning or at night.

Not all dogs who show scratching behaviour appear to be in pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr. Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs. Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM Cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine. If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis. If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition.

A veterinarian will rule out basic causes of scratching or discomfort such as ear mites, fleas, and allergies, and then, primary secretory otitis media (PSOM – glue ear), as well as spinal or limb injuries, before assuming that a Cavalier has SM. PSOM can present similar symptoms but is much easier and less expensive to treat. Episodic Falling Syndrome can also present similar symptoms. An MRI scan is normally done to confirm diagnosis of SM (and also will reveal PSOM). If a veterinarian suspects SM he or she will recommend an MRI scan. Neurologists give scanned dogs a signed certificate noting its grade.

===Episodic Falling (EF)===
Episodic Falling causes &quot;exercise-induced paroxysmal hypertonicity&quot; meaning that there is increased muscle tone in the dog and the muscles cannot relax. Previously thought to be a muscular disorder, it is now known to be neurological. EF is caused by a single recessive gene, and a genetic test is available. Except for severe cases, episodes will be in response to exercise, excitement or similar exertions. Although EF is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy, which typically results in loss of consciousness, the dog remains conscious throughout the episode. Severity of symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling to freezing to seizure-like episodes lasting hours. Episodes can become more or less severe as the dog gets older and there is no standard pattern to the attacks. The onset of symptoms usually occurs when a dog is between 4 months and 4 years of age. It is similar to Scotty Cramp, a genetic disorder in Scottish Terriers. About 1% of Cavaliers are affected by the condition, with 19% being carriers. Dogs with whole coloured coats were more likely to be affected than dogs with parti-coloured coats.

===Thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytopenia===
As many as half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may have a congenital blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements that aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers are the most common cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis is also a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.

===Hip and knee disorders===
Hip dysplasia is a common genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age. Hip dysplasia is diagnosed by X-rays, but it is not usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe hip dysplasia, X-rays may not always indicate the disease. In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.

Cavaliers can be subject to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This condition is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a Cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.

===Eye problems===
A disorder commonly found in Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as &quot;dry eye&quot;. The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog&#x27;s lacrimal gland (tear gland), reducing the production of tears. According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness. This disorder can decrease or heal over time.

A 1999 study of Cavaliers conducted by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include hereditary cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, microphthalmia, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia.

===Ear disorders===
Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), also known as glue ear, consists of a highly viscous mucus plug that fills the dog&#x27;s middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations in the head and neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers that actually have PSOM and not SM.

Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed to a form of congenital deafness, which is present at birth, due to a lack of formation or early degeneration of receptors in the inner ear, although this is relatively rare. In addition, more recent studies have found Cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss, which usually begins during puppy-hood and progresses until the dog is completely deaf, usually between the ages of three and five years. The progressive nature of this form of deafness in Cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of the hearing nerve rather than the lack of formation or early degeneration of the inner ear receptors.

== Urban legend ==

An urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK, overriding &quot;no dog except guide dogs&quot; rules. A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament. This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

The UK Parliament website states: &quot;Contrary to popular rumour, there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster. We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it.&quot; Similarly, there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK. A spokesman for the Kennel Club said: &quot;This law has been quoted from time to time. It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn&#x27;t tracked it down.&quot;

<text>Carola Maria Häggkvist (; born 8 September 1966), commonly known simply as Carola, is a Swedish pop singer and songwriter. She has been among Sweden&#x27;s most popular performers since the early 1980s and has released albums ranging from pop and disco to hymns and folk music. Her debut album, &quot;Främling&quot; (1983), sold around one million copies and remains the biggest-selling album in Swedish music history. During her career, she has recorded many top-selling albums and singles and is referred to as Sweden&#x27;s most prominent female singer. Some of her biggest hits are &quot;Främling&quot;, &quot;Tommy tycker om mig&quot;, &quot;Fångad av en stormvind&quot;, &quot;All the Reasons to Live&quot;, &quot;I Believe in Love&quot;, &quot;Genom allt&quot;, and &quot;Evighet&quot;. Besides Swedish, she has also released records in Dutch, German, English, Norwegian and Japanese.

Häggkvist has represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest on three occasions: in 1983, finishing third; in 1991, winning the contest; and in 2006, finishing fifth.

==Early life==
Carola Maria Häggkvist was born on 8 September 1966 at Södersjukhuset in Stockholm. She grew up in Norsborg, south of the Swedish capital. At the age of eight, she began to perform at Stockholm&#x27;s Miniteatern; she also attended Adolf Fredrik&#x27;s Music School. In 1977, Häggkvist won a talent competition and appeared on television for the first time, on &quot;Sveriges magasin&quot;, performing &quot;Krokodilbarnets klagan&quot;.

==Career==

===1981–1989: Early career and &quot;Främling&quot;===

In 1981, Swedish music promoter Bert Karlsson met then 15-year-old Häggkvist after she performed on the television series &quot;Hylands hörna&quot; and offered her the chance to take part in &quot;Melodifestivalen&quot;, the Swedish selection for the Eurovision Song Contest in 1982. She turned down the offer. Songwriter Lasse Holm offered Häggkvist two of his songs for Melodifestivalen 1983, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and &quot;Främling&quot;. &quot;Främling&quot; was chosen, and with it Häggkvist won the right to represent Sweden at that year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest in Munich. The song scored eight points, the highest possible mark, from all eleven regional juries. Häggkvist represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest on 23 April. She finished third in front of 6.1 million Swedish television viewers, 84% of the country&#x27;s population. This is still a record in Sweden.

&quot;Främling&quot; became the title track to Häggkvist&#x27;s debut album, which sold over one million copies, making it the biggest-selling album in Swedish history. After Eurovision, Häggkvist embarked on a tour of European television programmes, promoting &quot;Främling&quot; and performing in it several languages: in English as &quot;Love Isn&#x27;t Love&quot;, in German as &quot;Fremder&quot;, and in Dutch as &quot;Je ogen hebben geen geheimen&quot;. The album contained hits like &quot;Mickey&quot;, &quot;Liv&quot;, &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Tokyo&quot;. In December 1983, she released her first Christmas album, &quot;Julefrid med Carola&quot;, which sold 200,000 copies. In 1984, Häggkvist released two top-selling pop/rock albums that together sold over 1 million copies. &quot;Tommy tycker om mig&quot; became a huge hit in Sweden, together with &quot;Hunger&quot;. She later travelled to Japan and recorded a single in Japanese. In 1985, the Bee Gees collaborated with her on the album &quot;Runaway&quot;, which was written by the Gibb brothers and produced by Maurice Gibb. The record sold double platinum when released in Sweden the following year. &quot;The Runaway&quot;, &quot;Brand New Heart&quot;, &quot;Spread your wings&quot; and &quot;Radiate&quot; became massive hits in Scandinavia. In 1987, Häggkvist embarked on a church tour with pianist Per-Erik Hallin. After this followed a career hiatus for the singer.

===1990–1991: New image, independence, and Eurovision victory===
In 1990, she returned to Melodifestivalen, with &quot;Mitt i ett äventyr&quot; (&quot;In the middle of an adventure&quot;). The song finished second in the festival, failing to earn Häggkvist the right to represent Sweden at Eurovision. Edin-Ådahl won the event. Her comeback album, titled &quot;Much More&quot;, was released, earning a gold certificate in Sweden. However, Häggkvist and songwriter Stephan Berg had already begun planning another attempt at Eurovision.

In 1991, she returned to Melodifestivalen with &quot;Fångad av en stormvind&quot; (&quot;Captured by a lovestorm&quot;). The song won the festival by thirty-two points and became the Swedish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest in Rome. British bookmakers considered Häggkvist second favourite to win the contest. On the night of the contest, with one voting jury left to announce their scores, three countries remained in contention to win the contest: Sweden, with 146 points; Israel, with 139; and France, with 134. Neither Israel nor Sweden won any points from the Italian jury, but France won twelve, leaving Sweden and France tied for first place with 146 at the conclusion of the voting. Sweden won the contest after a countback, having received five ten-point scores during the voting versus France&#x27;s two. &quot;Fångad av en stormvind&quot; became a huge hit in Europe, and was followed by a compilation album, &quot;Hits&quot;, and a Christmas album, &quot;Jul&quot;. After her victory, she released an international version of &quot;Much More&quot; and went on an extended promotional tour throughout Europe. Her album produced several hits, among them &quot;I&#x27;ll live&quot; and &quot;All the Reasons to Live&quot;.

=== 1992–2004: Albums, tours, and musicals ===

Häggkvist was the first Scandinavian pop artist to perform in China—in front of an estimated 600 million television viewers; she also released an album in China in 1992. In 1992 and 1993, Rival International, released Carola&#x27;s earlier albums on CD. She was originally signed to Mariann Records in Scandinavia.

In 1993, ten years after her breakthrough representing Sweden at the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest, she recorded a gospel album, &quot;My Tribute&quot;, which was released in sixteen countries, making her gospel artist of the year in the Netherlands in 1994. The album contains the hit-single &quot;My Tribute&quot;, one of Häggkvist&#x27;s best-known songs. In 1994, Häggkvist released a rock-themed album, &#x27;&quot;Personligt&quot; (Personally), marking her debut as a songwriter and selling gold. &quot;Så länge jag lever&quot;, &quot;Sanna Vänner&quot; and &quot;Guld i dina ögon&quot; became hits and received a great amount of radio airplay.

In 1995, Häggkvist made her debut as a musical actress, playing Maria in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; opposite Tommy Körberg as the male lead. She played the role in 325 performances and won the prestigious &quot;Guldmasken&quot; (Golden Mask) award. Three years later, she sang the theme song in the Norwegian musical &quot;Sophie&#x27;s World&quot;, which was released on the album &quot;Songs from Sophie&#x27;s World&quot;. Also in 1998, Häggkvist played the voice of Mirjam in the Swedish version of &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;. In 2002, she made a short appearance as Fantine in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in London and five Scandinavian cities.

In November 1997, Häggkvist released another compilation album, &quot;De bästa av Carola&quot; (&quot;The Best of Carola&quot;), and with it several new singles like &quot;Dreamer&quot;. Following this came an album of tracks penned by Lina Sandell, &quot;Blott en dag&quot; (&quot;Just One Day&quot;). The album received excellent reviews and revealed Carola&#x27;s passion for hymns. In 1999, another Christmas album was released: &quot;Jul i Betlehem&quot; (&quot;Christmas in Bethlehem&quot;). The album sold 600,000 units throughout Scandinavia, including 350,000 in Sweden. and became the biggest-selling album of 1999. She also co-wrote the ballad &quot;Himlen i min famn&quot;, which remains a popular Christmas song that is often performed at Christmas concerts. In the summer of 1999, she toured in the &quot;Rhapsody in Rock&quot;.

In 2001, she released &quot;Sov på min arm&quot;, an album based on Christian hymns, gospel melodies and intimate ballads. It became one of the most-sold albums in Scandinavia that year. In 2002, she release the pop/country album &quot;My Show&quot;, which received great reviews. The album, which marked Häggkvist&#x27;s return to the pop scene, contained several hits such as &quot;The Light&quot;, &quot;I believe in love&quot;, which also topped the Estonian and Brazilian charts, and &quot;A Kiss Goodbye&quot;. Even though the album only peaked at number 6 on the Swedish album chart, it sold 100,000 copies by the end of the year. In the summer, Häggkvist embarked on a huge and luxurious Scandinavian tour.

In 2003, Häggkvist submitted a song, &quot;Autumn Leaf&quot;, for Melodifestivalen 2003. Having performed the demo, she was required to perform the song when it qualified for the competition. Häggkvist decided against doing that, and the song was disqualified from the competition. &quot;Autumn Leaf&quot; appeared on Häggkvist&#x27;s next album, &quot;Guld, platina &amp; passion&quot;, in Swedish as &quot;När löven faller&quot; (When the leaves fall). The ballad became an enormous hit. &quot;Guld, platina &amp; passion&quot; reached number 1 on the Swedish charts and sold over 300,000 copies. She also recorded her favorite Elvis Presley songs, &quot;Walk a mile in my shoes&quot; and &quot;If I can dream&quot;. The following year, Häggkvist released a religious album, &quot;Credo&quot;, which she described as &quot;an expression of my love for God&quot;. The album peaked at spot 2 on the Swedish album chart. This was followed by &quot;Störst av allt&quot;, which Dan Backman of &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; wrote featured &quot;spiritually aimed music…revolving around belonging, love, death and eternity&quot;. &quot;Genom Allt&quot; became a huge radio hit in Sweden and the soul ballad &quot;Allt kommer bli bra mamma&quot;, a dedication to her deceased mother, became popular at religious events.

=== 2005–present: Return to Eurovision ===

Having performed as part of the interval act at Melodifestivalen 2005, Häggkvist confirmed that she would return to the competition in 2006. She performed &quot;Evighet&quot; (&quot;Eternity&quot;), written by Bobby Ljunggren, Henrik Wikström and Thomas G:son, which she described as a &quot;true winning song&quot;. The song qualified from the fourth semi-final in Gothenburg on 11 March 2006, and was widely tipped to win the festival outright as the final at the Stockholm Globe Arena approached. Despite finishing second with the regional juries to Andreas Johnson, &quot;Evighet&quot; won the competition with 232 points. Prior to the contest, Carola visited 12 countries where she promoted her song. &quot;Invincible&quot; received a large amount of air play on the radios in these countries. The song qualified from the semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Athens, in English as &quot;Invincible&quot;. Häggkvist in the end finished fifth out of twenty-four with 170 points. This placing also made her the third-most successful artist in the history of Eurovision, counting by total points earned in her performances, with her three songs scoring a total of 442 points, behind only Dima Bilan, the 2006 runner-up and 2008 winner; and Loreen, winner of 2012 and 2023.

Following Melodifestivalen, Häggkvist released a pop album, &quot;Från nu till evighet&quot; (&quot;From Now to Eternity&quot;). Lennart Wrigholm reviewed the album for &quot;Musiklandet&quot;; he criticised the amount of new material on the album: &quot;Has this old lady really got such a workload that she cannot put more than ten new tracks on her album?&quot; and wrote that the inclusion of the English version of &quot;Evighet&quot; as a bonus track was &quot;an insult to the potential buyer&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;Expressen&quot;″s Anders Nunstedt wrote that on &quot;Jag ger allt&quot; (&quot;I Give It All&quot;) &quot;the title does not lie&quot; and that &quot;Vem kan älska mig&quot; (&quot;Who Can Love Me&quot;) features a &quot;brilliant refrain&quot;. The album topped the Swedish sales chart, and sold approximately 100,000 copies by the end of the year. &quot;Stanna eller gå&quot;, a Latin-inspired pop song, became a radio hit during the summer. Following the album&#x27;s release, Häggkvist toured Sweden and received outstanding reviews. During the autumn, Häggkvist had problems with her voice but nonetheless sang &quot;Because We Believe&quot;, a song written by Andrea Bocelli, with the Italian tenor.

In late 2007, Häggkvist released another Christmas album, &quot;I denna natt blir världen ny&quot; (&quot;There is a New World This Night&quot;), a sequel to &quot;Jul i Betlehem&quot;. The album featured songs in Swedish and English, and was recorded in Jerusalem in June 2007. Stefan Malmqvist of &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; wrote that, as in previous Christmas albums, Häggkvist is &quot;a saccharine version of herself&quot; when singing Christmas carols. The album was reported to have sold 90,000 copies. Included on the album was the gospel song &quot;Go and Tell It on the Mountain&quot;. After the release she toured Scandinavia.

Carola entered Melodifestivalen 2008 as part of the duo &quot;Johnson &amp; Häggkvist&quot; with Andreas Johnson. Their first single was called &quot;Lucky Star&quot; which became popular on the radio. In the melodifestival in February, they sang &quot;One Love&quot;, written by Carola, Johnson and Peter Kvint. They were the early favourites to win the whole show, taking part in the second qualifier. They qualified for the Second Chance round, missing out on an automatic final spot. Though widely tipped to qualify for the final after all, they did not even proceed from the first voting round in the Second Chance programme. Although &quot;One Love&quot; did not become an enormous success, the song &quot;Lucky Star&quot; which they released a few months prior to the contest did sell well, and topped the Swedish charts for weeks. Carola decided to take it easy the rest of the year, but did embark on a small Christmas tour at the end of the year. In 2009, Carola was reportedly working on her upcoming album, and other projects. She went to the United States to record some new material. She departed from her recording company and signed a contract with X5 Music Group, in which she aims to transfer her music abroad through the internet. In June, she hosted &quot;Carola Camp&quot;, a camp designed to help talented young singers and entertainers. In May, she performed at the Eurovision Song Contest held in Moscow at the kick-off ceremony, performing her 3 Eurovision songs. In July, she performed, together with the Eurovision winner Alexander Rybak in Norway and sang &quot;Fairytale&quot; and &quot;Främling&quot; and The Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;.
At the end of 2009, she released the album &quot;Christmas in Bethlehem&quot;, which contained duets with artists like Paul Potts. She embarked on yet another Christmas tour, visiting Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. She also launched her new website.

Carola attended in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö and performed in a humorous interval act about Swedish culture.

In the summer of 2010, Carola embarked on tour across Sweden, singing the hits of both Elvis Presley and Barbra Streisand. The influence came from Carola&#x27;s childhood, where her father and her mother would play records by both their favourite artists. The tour was an instant success, selling out and becoming one of the few tours to sell out that year. She took time out from the tour to appear on Allsång på Skansen, and in March 2011 she released a studio album, containing twelve songs.

In 2014 Häggkvist participated in &quot;Så mycket bättre&quot; on TV4.

Carola attended the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 in Stockholm and was briefly interviewed on screen along with another previous Swedish winner Loreen.

In late-October 2016, she released her new Christmas album titled &quot;Drömmen om julen&quot;. The release was followed by a tour.

In April 2021, it was announced that Carola would be the spokesperson for Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, reading out the Swedish jury points at the Grand Final. She will perform &quot;Waterloo&quot; with Charlotte Perrelli and Conchita Wurst as an interval act for the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024.

==Personal life and media attention==
Her status as one of the most popular national celebrities of her country made her more or less constantly followed by the tabloid press. She has often talked about her Christian faith and much of the focus has been around her membership in the controversial evangelical church &quot;Livets Ord&quot; (Word of Life).

She was married to Runar Søgaard, a Norwegian Christian preacher, with whom she has a son, Amadeus. The couple divorced in 2000, after ten years of marriage. She adopted a daughter, Zoe, from South Africa, in 2012. (Her parents had both died in 2004.)

In 2015 she was assisting a man to transport eight refugees on the Greek island of Kos. She prevented thieves from stealing the refugees&#x27; boat engine, but caused a high-speed car chase. At a police station, the motor thieves accused her of illegally transporting refugees. She was arrested, but released a few hours later with no charges.

===Controversy regarding opinions on homosexuality===
In an interview in 2002 for the Swedish gay magazine &quot;QX&quot;, she alienated many gay and some heterosexual fans by alleging that she knew homosexual people who had become heterosexual through prayers. She also said that homosexuality would always remain &quot;unnatural&quot; to her.

Four years later, her comment was brought up when she participated in the Swedish national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest in March 2006. During a press conference a journalist tried to ask her about her opinions on homosexuality, but she did not answer.

On 15 March 2006 Rickard Engfors, who was Carola&#x27;s cooperating partner during the Melodifestivalen and Eurovision Song Contest 2006, said &quot;Carola doesn&#x27;t hate gays. If she did, I wouldn&#x27;t work for her. She is a fantastic person.&quot;

During an exclusive interview for one of the Eurovision-related websites before the 2006 contest, Carola was also questioned about this, and she stated that she &quot;would love for every gay person to feel that she loves them&quot; and that she does not think that &quot;being gay is a sickness&quot;. She went on to criticize the tabloids for misinterpreting her original words and making an issue out of it. Later in the interview, she also commented on one of her supporting dancers being gay and his boyfriend being &quot;great&quot;.

In 2008, she spoke to the newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; and again revisited her opinions about homosexuality, which she insisted have evolved over the past two decades and are very inclusive. She said, &quot;I actually invited gays from &quot;QX&quot; to my 25-year anniversary [concert], but &quot;QX&quot; turned it down. What can I do? I love all people. I love the gays. So I am definitely not homophobic in any way. We are here for the music and I have no wacky opinions. And I feel love from many homosexuals too.&quot;

In 2014, while participating on the TV show &quot;Så mycket bättre&quot;, she revealed that she had a romance with a woman in the 1980s. She said &quot;I remember when I hung out with a girl actually in the &#x27;80s. We were definitely not a couple, but I tested. It was a bit hard because I felt an extreme attraction and a force in that, but I chose not to go further&quot;. On the 2019 series of &quot;Så mycket bättre&quot;, she was asked about possibly having a relation with a woman in the future, and she said that it is a possibility.

<text>Theodor Franz Eduard Kaluza (; 9 November 1885 – 19 January 1954) was a German mathematician and physicist known for the Kaluza–Klein theory, involving field equations in five-dimensional space-time. His idea that fundamental forces can be unified by introducing additional dimensions was reused much later for string theory.

==Life==
Kaluza was born to a Roman Catholic family from the town of Ratibor (present-day Racibórz in Poland) in the German Empire&#x27;s Prussian Province of Silesia. Kaluza himself was born in Wilhelmsthal (a village that was incorporated into Oppeln (presently Opole) in 1899). He spent his youth in Königsberg, where his father, Maximilian &quot;Max&quot; Kaluza, was a professor of the English language. He entered the University of Königsberg to study mathematics and gained his doctorate with a thesis on Tschirnhaus transformations. Kaluza was primarily a mathematician but began studying relativity. In April 1919 Kaluza noticed that when he solved Albert Einstein&#x27;s equations for general relativity using five dimensions, then Maxwellian equations for electromagnetism resulted spontaneously. Kaluza wrote to Einstein who, in turn, encouraged him to publish. Kaluza&#x27;s theory was published in 1921 in a paper &quot;Zum Unitätsproblem der Physik&quot; with Einstein&#x27;s support in &quot;Sitzungsberichte Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot; 966–972 (1921).

Kaluza&#x27;s insight is remembered as the Kaluza–Klein theory (named also after physicist Oskar Klein). However, the work was neglected for many years, as attention was directed towards quantum mechanics. His idea that fundamental forces can be explained by additional dimensions was not reused until string theory was developed. It is, however, also notable that many of the aspects of this body of work were already published in 1914 by Gunnar Nordström, but his work also went unnoticed and was not recognized when the ideas were reused.

For the rest of his career Kaluza continued to produce ideas about relativity and about models of the atomic nucleus. Despite Einstein&#x27;s encouragement, Kaluza remained only a (Privatdozent) at Königsberg until 1929, when he was appointed as professor at the University of Kiel. In 1935, he became a full professor at the University of Göttingen, where he remained until his death in 1954. Perhaps his finest mathematical work is the textbook &quot;Höhere Mathematik für den Praktiker&quot;, which was written jointly with Georg Joos.

==Personal life==
Kaluza was extraordinarily versatile. He spoke or wrote 17 languages. He also had an unusually modest personality. He refused the Nazi ideology, and his appointment to the Göttingen professorship was possible only with difficulties and by assistance of his colleague Helmut Hasse. Strange stories were told of his private life, for example, that he taught himself to swim during his thirties by reading a book about it and succeeded at his first attempt in the water.

Kaluza had a son (1910-1994), also named , who was a notable mathematician.

<text>Mark Anthony Joseph Morrison (born 12 May 1974) is an English singer, best known for his 1996 platinum hit song &quot;Return of the Mack&quot;, which was immediately met with success upon its release in several European countries. In the following year, the song peaked at No. 2 in the United States.

== Career ==
Morrison&#x27;s first official recording was the 1993 vinyl release &quot;Where Is Our Love&quot;, pressed on his own private Joe&#x27;Mel label.

In mid-1995, Morrison released his debut single, &quot;Crazy&quot;, which became a Top 20 hit in the UK and was a club favourite. The follow-up single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Down&quot;, also entered the Top 40. They were followed in the spring of 1996 by &quot;Return of the Mack&quot;, which became a smash international hit, spending two weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart.

His debut album, also titled &quot;Return of the Mack&quot;, followed and became a multi-platinum success. It reached number four in the UK chart and sold 3 million albums worldwide. It spun off several more hit singles over the next year: &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Trippin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Horny&quot; and &quot;Moan &amp; Groan&quot; would all reach the UK Top 10, making him the first artist in British pop history to have five Top 10 hits from a debut album.

Although his career was going well, Morrison was constantly in trouble with the police. In 1997, he was imprisoned. The same year he received numerous nominations: four Brit Award nominations, a Mercury Prize nomination, an MTV Europe Music Award nomination, and five MOBO Award nominations. &quot;Return of the Mack&quot; began to climb its way to No. 2 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, receiving platinum status. It stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for a lengthy 40 weeks. Morrison had one further minor US hit, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Moan &amp; Groan,&quot; which went to number 76.

Morrison performed at the 1997 Brit Awards. The performance influenced WEA and Morrison to release &quot;Only God Can Judge Me&quot;, a nine-track EP which contains live performances, interviews, prayers and three full-length songs, including &quot;Who&#x27;s the Mack!&quot;, which reached No. 13 in the UK.

Morrison appeared on the 1999 Brit Awards where he presented an award, introduced Whitney Houston and announced his return to music. In September 1999, a single titled &quot;Best Friend&quot; (featuring Conner Reeves and Gabrielle) became Morrison&#x27;s ninth Top 40 hit single, reaching No. 23 on the UK Singles Chart. The following year, it was announced by &quot;Billboard&quot; that Morrison had signed a five-year worldwide deal with Death Row Records founder Suge Knight, making him the first, and only, European (British) artist to be signed with Death Row Records, in a deal which saw Death Row Records UK operating as an independent record label in conjunction with the Ritz Music Group (a company known for its success with Irish country music artists such as Daniel O&#x27;Donnell).

He later signed to soccer player Kevin Campbell&#x27;s 2 Wikid label in 2003. His only release for the label, a single entitled &quot;Just a Man&quot;/&quot;Backstabbers&quot;, was a minor UK hit, reaching No. 48 in the UK Singles Chart in August 2004.

In May 2006, Morrison released the limited-edition CD/DVD album entitled &quot;Innocent Man&quot; in the United Kingdom on his private label, Mack Life Records. The title track, &quot;Innocent Man&quot; (featuring DMX) was released in March 2006. It was well received and reached No. 46 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2007, he was featured on hip-hop artist Cassidy&#x27;s single titled &quot;Innocent Man (Misunderstood)&quot; from the album &quot;B.A.R.S. The Barry Adrian Reese Story&quot;. The track sampled Morrison&#x27;s vocals from &quot;Innocent Man&quot; and charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.

On 29 January 2007, he released the single titled &quot;Dance 4 Me&quot; (featuring Tanya Stephens). It was the fourth single to be released from his album &quot;Innocent Man&quot;. The official music video was directed by Ray Kay.

In 2012, Morrison appeared as a guest feature on Houston rapper Trae tha Truth&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m On 2.0&quot; which featured notable rappers Big K.R.I.T., Jadakiss, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, B.o.B, Tyga, Gudda Gudda and Bun B. A music video for &quot;I&#x27;m On 2.0&quot; starring Morrison and all artists featured was released on 3 June. Also in June 2012, he announced the release of a new single titled &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Good&quot;. The single was set to be released 29 July 2013 and paid homage to the charity Refuge. The single was unsuccessful, and shelved before release. It would ultimately remain unreleased.

In June 2013, Morrison released the music video to &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; shot by DIS Guise of Visionnaire Pictures, with the release date set for the single on iTunes of 1 September 2013.

On 20 October 2013, he released a single titled &quot;N.A.N.G. 2.0&quot; featuring Crooked I and Shonie.

On 7 July 2014, Morrison released an EP titled &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;. The EP included the singles &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; and &quot;N.A.N.G. 2.0&quot;, with five additional new songs.

In September 2016, American DJ Nevada remixed &quot;Return of the Mack&quot; for its 20th anniversary, retitling it &quot;The Mack&quot;. Nevada&#x27;s version features the re-recorded vocals of Morrison, and additional vocals from American rapper Fetty Wap.

In May 2017, a series of Burger King commercials for Mac and Cheetos featured a remix of Morrison&#x27;s classic, entitled &quot;Return of the Mac and Cheetos&quot;.

In July 2020, McDonald&#x27;s featured &quot;Return of the Mack&quot; in a UK television commercial, as part of a post-COVID-19 lockdown promotional campaign to mark the resumption of services and the gradual reopening of restaurants.

In 2021, Morrison was featured alongside Chris Brown on G-Eazy&#x27;s single &quot;Provide&quot;, as the song samples &quot;Return of the Mack&quot;.

In October 2022, Morrison, Post Malone and Sickick released a mashup of &quot;Cooped Up&quot; and &quot;Return of the Mack&quot;. The song went viral on social media, then was made available for retail purchase.

==Legal issues ==
Morrison has faced various criminal charges during his career, including a 1997 conviction for attempting to bring a firearm aboard an airliner, for which he served three months in jail just as his hit song &quot;Return of the Mack&quot; began rising up the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In 1998, he failed to appear in court on charges of possessing an offensive weapon, choosing to instead fly to Barbados. He was arrested and remanded into custody upon his return to the United Kingdom. He was later cleared of the offensive weapon charge.

He was convicted of affray for his part in a brawl resulting in one fatality and sentenced to community service. Morrison later was incarcerated in Wormwood Scrubs for a year for paying a lookalike (Gabriel Maferika) to perform his court-appointed community service in his stead, while Morrison himself went on tour. While in prison, Morrison reportedly converted to Islam and attempted to change his name to Abdul Rahman. Also in 1998, Morrison was banned from driving for six months and fined £1,380 after twice being caught driving without a licence.

In 2002, Morrison was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and car theft. He was released on bail, but a policeman was later arrested on suspicion of taking a bribe from Morrison in return for his release. Morrison failed to appear in court to face the charges and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

In 2004, he was arrested and spent a night in custody, after a fracas in which a platinum and diamond medallion was snatched from around his neck during a confrontation at a Leicester nightclub.

In 2009, Morrison was arrested for an assault in London.

== Personal life ==
Morrison was born in Hanover, West Germany, on 12 May 1974. Morrison later lived in Leicester, England, until moving to the US city of West Palm Beach, Florida, at age 11. After graduating from Palm Beach Lakes High School in 1990, Morrison returned to Leicester.

He is of Barbadian descent. 

In October 2020, Morrison publicly stated that he would consider challenging Peter Soulsby to become the next Mayor of Leicester. His bid ended in September 2022.

In October 2022, Morrison bought a house in Florida, paying $2 million in cash. He bought a second home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in December 2023.

<text>Jacopo Robusti (late September or early October 151831 May 1594), best known as Tintoretto ( ; , ), was an Italian Renaissance painter of the Venetian school. His contemporaries both admired and criticized the speed with which he painted, and the unprecedented boldness of his brushwork. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed . His work is characterised by his muscular figures, dramatic gestures and bold use of perspective, in the Mannerist style.

==Life==

===The years of apprenticeship===
Tintoretto was born in Venice in 1518. His father, Battista, was a dyer – in Italian and in Venetian; hence the son got the nickname of Tintoretto, &quot;little dyer&quot;, or &quot;dyer&#x27;s boy&quot;. Tintoretto is known to have had at least one sibling, a brother named Domenico, although an unreliable 17th-century account says his siblings numbered 22. The family was believed to have originated from Brescia, in Lombardy, then part of the Republic of Venice. Older studies gave the Tuscan town of Lucca as the origin of the family.

Little is known of Tintoretto&#x27;s childhood or training. According to his early biographers Carlo Ridolfi (1642) and Marco Boschini (1660), his only formal apprenticeship was in the studio of Titian, who angrily dismissed him after only a few days—either out of jealousy of so promising a student (in Ridolfi&#x27;s account) or because of a personality clash (in Boschini&#x27;s version). From this time forward the relationship between the two artists remained rancorous, despite Tintoretto&#x27;s continued admiration for Titian. For his part, Titian actively disparaged Tintoretto, as did his adherents.

Tintoretto sought no further teaching but studied on his own account with laborious zeal. According to Ridolfi, he gained some experience by working alongside artisans who decorated furniture with paintings of mythological scenes, and studied anatomy by drawing live models and dissecting cadavers. He lived poorly, collecting casts, bas-reliefs, and prints, and practising with their aid. At some time, possibly in the 1540s, Tintoretto acquired models of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Dawn&quot;, &quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Dusk&quot; and &quot;Night&quot;, which he and his workshop studied in numerous drawings made from all angles on blue paper. Now and afterward he very frequently worked by night as well as by day. His noble conception of art and his high personal ambition were both evidenced in the inscription which he placed over his studio &quot;Il disegno di Michelangelo ed il colorito di Tiziano&quot; (&quot;Michelangelo&#x27;s drawing and Titian&#x27;s colour&quot;).

===Early works===
The young painter Andrea Schiavone, four years Tintoretto&#x27;s junior, was much in his company. Tintoretto helped Schiavone at no charge with wall paintings, and in many subsequent instances, he also worked for nothing, and thus succeeded in obtaining commissions. The two earliest mural paintings of Tintoretto—done, like others, for next to no pay—are said to have been &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; and a &quot;Cavalry Fight&quot;. These have both long since perished, as have all his frescoes, early or later. The first work of his to attract some considerable notice was a portrait group of himself and his brother—the latter playing the guitar—with a nocturnal effect; this has also been lost. It was followed by some historical subject, which Titian was candid enough to praise.

One of Tintoretto&#x27;s early pictures still extant is in the church of the Carmine in Venice, the &quot;Presentation of Jesus in the Temple&quot; (); also in S. Benedetto are the &quot;Annunciation&quot; and &quot;Christ with the Woman of Samaria&quot;. For the Scuola della Trinità (the scuole or schools of Venice were confraternities, more in the nature of charitable foundations than of educational institutions) he painted four subjects from Genesis. Two of these, now in the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia in Venice, are &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; and the &quot;Death of Abel&quot;, both noble works of high mastery, which indicate that Tintoretto was by this time a consummate painter—one of the few who have attained to the highest eminence in the absence of any recorded formal training. Until 2012, &quot;The Embarkation of St Helena in the Holy Land&quot; was attributed to Schiavone. But a new analysis of the work has revealed it as one of a series of three paintings by Tintoretto, depicting the legend of St Helena and the Holy Cross. The error was uncovered during work on a project to catalogue continental European oil paintings in the United Kingdom. &quot;The Embarkation of St Helena&quot; was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1865. Its sister paintings, &quot;The Discovery of the True Cross&quot; and &quot;St Helen Testing the True Cross&quot;, are held in galleries in the United States.

===Saint Mark paintings===
In 1548 Tintoretto was commissioned to paint a large decoration for the Scuola di S. Marco: the &quot;Miracle of the Slave&quot;. Realizing that the commission presented him with a singular opportunity to establish himself as a major artist, he took extraordinary care in arranging the composition for maximum effect. The painting represents the legend of a Christian slave or captive who was to be tortured as a punishment for some acts of devotion to the evangelist, but was saved by the miraculous intervention of the latter, who shattered the bone-breaking and blinding implements which were about to be applied. Tintoretto&#x27;s conception of the narrative is distinguished by a marked theatricality, unusual colour choices, and vigorous execution.

The painting was a triumphant success, despite some detractors. Tintoretto&#x27;s friend Pietro Aretino praised the work, calling particular attention to the figure of the slave, but warned Tintoretto against hasty execution. As a result of the painting&#x27;s success, Tintoretto received numerous commissions. For the church of San Rocco he painted &quot;Saint Roch Cures the Plague Victims&quot; (1549), one of the first of Tintoretto&#x27;s many &quot;laterali&quot; (horizontal paintings). These were large-scale paintings intended for the side walls of Venetian chapels. Knowing that the congregation would view them from an angle, Tintoretto composed the paintings with off-centre perspective so the illusion of depth would be effective when seen from a viewpoint near the end of the painting that was closer to the worshippers.

Around 1555 he painted the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, an oil-on-canvas painting for the church of Santa Maria dei Crociferi.
In 1551, Paolo Veronese arrived in Venice and quickly began receiving the prestigious commissions that Tintoretto coveted. Unwilling to be overshadowed by his new rival, Tintoretto approached the leaders of his neighbourhood church, the Madonna dell&#x27;Orto, with a proposal to paint for them two colossal canvases on a cost-only basis. He had already painted the &quot;Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple&quot; (), one of his major works, for the church; it repeats a subject that had earlier been painted by Titian, but in place of Titian&#x27;s classically balanced composition is a startling visual drama of figures arranged on a receding staircase. Tintoretto now intended to create a sensation by painting for the Madonna dell&#x27;Orto the two tallest canvases ever painted during the Renaissance. He settled down in a house near the church, looking over the Fondamenta de Mori, which is still standing.

Depicting the &quot;Worship of the Golden Calf&quot; and the &quot;Last Judgment&quot;, the tall paintings (both –60) were widely admired, and Tintoretto gained a reputation for his ability to complete the most massive projects on a limited budget. Thereafter, Tintoretto habitually competed against rival painters by producing paintings quickly at a low cost. In about 1564, Tintoretto painted three additional works for Scuola di S. Marco: the &quot;Finding of the body of St Mark&quot;, the &quot;St Mark&#x27;s Body Brought to Venice&quot;, and &quot;St Mark Rescuing a Saracen from Shipwreck&quot;. 

About 1560, Tintoretto married his second wife, Faustina de Vescovi, daughter of a Venetian nobleman who was the &quot;guardian grande&quot; of the Scuola Grande di San Marco.

===Scuola di San Rocco===
Between 1565 and 1567, and again from 1575 to 1588, Tintoretto produced a large number of paintings for the walls and ceilings of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco. The first room he painted was Sala dell&#x27;Allbergo, filled with scenes from the Passion of Christ. The subterfuge by which he won the commission has been called &quot;the most notorious incident of Tintoretto&#x27;s career&quot;. In 1564, four finalists—Tintoretto, Federico Zuccaro, Giuseppe Salviati, and Paolo Veronese—were invited by the Scuola to submit &quot;modelli&quot; for a ceiling painting on the subject of &quot;Saint Roch in Glory&quot; to decorate the hall called the Sala dell&#x27;Albergo. Instead of a sketch, Tintoretto produced a full-sized painting, secretly installed it on the ceiling, and presented it as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; on the day of the competition. Tintoretto then announced that he was offering the painting as a gift—perhaps conscious that a bylaw of the foundation prohibited the rejection of any gift.

In 1565, he resumed work at the scuola, painting the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, for which a sum of 250 ducats was paid. In 1576 he presented gratis another centre-piece—that for the ceiling of the great hall, representing the &quot;Plague of Serpents&quot;; and in the following year he completed this ceiling with pictures of the &quot;Paschal Feast&quot; and &quot;Moses striking the Rock&quot; accepting whatever pittance the confraternity chose to pay.

The development of fast painting techniques called &quot;prestezza&quot; allowed him to produce many works while engaged on large projects and to respond to growing demands from clients. This, and his use of assistants, enabled Tintoretto ultimately to produce a greater number of paintings for the Venetian state than any of his competitors.

Tintoretto next launched out into the painting of the entire scuola and of the adjacent church of San Rocco. In November 1577, he offered to execute the works at the rate of 100 ducats per annum, with three pictures being due each year. This proposal was accepted and was punctually fulfilled, the painter&#x27;s death alone preventing the execution of some of the ceiling subjects. The whole sum paid for the scuola throughout was 2,447 ducats. Disregarding some minor performances, the scuola and church contain fifty-two memorable paintings, which may be described as vast suggestive sketches, with the mastery, but not the deliberate precision, of finished pictures, and adapted for being looked at in a dusky half-light. &quot;Adam and Eve&quot;, the &quot;Visitation&quot;, the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, the &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot;, the &quot;Agony in the Garden&quot;, &quot;Christ before Pilate&quot;, &quot;Christ carrying His Cross&quot;, and (this alone having been marred by restoration) the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; are leading examples in the scuola; in the church, &quot;Christ Curing the Paralytic&quot;.
It was probably in 1560, the year in which he began working in the Scuola di S. Rocco, that Tintoretto commenced his numerous paintings in the Doge&#x27;s Palace; he then executed there a portrait of the Doge, Girolamo Priuli. Other works (destroyed by a fire in the palace in 1577) succeeded—the &quot;Excommunication of Frederick Barbarossa by Pope Alexander III&quot; and the &quot;Victory of Lepanto&quot;.

After the fire, Tintoretto started afresh, Paolo Veronese being his colleague. In the Sala dell&#x27;Anticollegio, Tintoretto painted four masterpieces—&quot;Bacchus, with Ariadne crowned by Venus&quot;, the &quot;Three Graces and Mercury&quot;, &quot;Minerva discarding Mars&quot;, and the &quot;Forge of Vulcan&quot;, which were painted for fifty ducats each, excluding materials, c. 1578; in the hall of the senate, &quot;Venice, Queen of the Sea&quot; (1581–84); in the hall of the college, the &quot;Espousal of St Catherine to Jesus&quot; (1581–84); in the Antichiesetta, &quot;Saint George, Saint Louis, and the Princess&quot;, and &quot;St Jerome and St Andrew&quot;; in the hall of the great council, nine large compositions, chiefly battle-pieces (1581–84); in the Sala dello Scrutinio the &quot;Capture of Zara from the Hungarians in 1346 amid a Hurricane of Missiles&quot; (1584–87).

===&quot;Paradise&quot;===
The crowning production of Tintoretto&#x27;s life was the vast &quot;Paradise&quot; painted for the Doge&#x27;s Palace, in size , reputed to be the largest painting ever done upon canvas. While the commission for this huge work was yet pending and unassigned Tintoretto was wont to tell the senators that he had prayed to God that he might be commissioned for it, so that paradise itself might perchance be his recompense after death.

Tintoretto competed with several other artists for the prestigious commission. A large sketch of the composition he submitted in 1577 is now in the Louvre, Paris. In 1583, he painted a second sketch with a different composition, which is in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid.

The commission was given jointly to Paolo Veronese and Francesco Bassano, but Veronese died in 1588 before starting the work, and the commission was reassigned to Tintoretto. He set up his canvas in the Scuola vecchia della Misericordia and worked indefatigably at the task, making many alterations and doing various heads and costumes direct from life.

When the painting had been nearly completed he took it to its proper place, where it was completed largely by assistants, his son Domenico foremost among them. All Venice applauded the finished work; Ridolfi wrote that &quot;it seemed to everyone that heavenly beatitude had been disclosed to mortal eyes.&quot; Modern art historians have been less enthusiastic, and have generally considered the &quot;Paradise&quot; inferior in execution to the two sketches. It has suffered from neglect, but little from restoration.

Tintoretto was asked to name his own price, but this he left to the authorities. They tendered a handsome amount; he is said to have abated something from it, an incident perhaps more telling of his lack of greed than earlier cases where he worked for nothing at all.

== Pupils ==
Tintoretto had very few pupils; his daughter, Marietta, his two sons, and Maerten de Vos of Antwerp were among them. Marietta had been a frequent companion with Tintoretto in her childhood and became an accomplished artist. His son Domenico Tintoretto frequently assisted his father in the preliminary work for great pictures. He painted a multitude of works, many of them of a very large scale. At best, they would be considered mediocre and, coming from the son of Tintoretto, are disappointing. In any event, he must be regarded as a considerable pictorial practitioner in his way. 

=== Influence ===
There are reflections of Tintoretto to be found in the Greek painter of the Spanish Renaissance El Greco, who likely saw his works during a stay in Venice, and studied them well enough that they influenced his painting style. 

== Personality ==

Tintoretto scarcely ever travelled away from Venice. His early biographers write of his intelligence and fierce ambition; according to Carlo Ridolfi, &quot;he was always thinking of ways to make himself known as the most daring painter in the world.&quot; 

He loved all the arts and as a youth played the lute and various instruments, some of them of his own invention, and designed theatrical costumes and properties. He was well versed in mechanics and mechanical devices also. 

While being a very agreeable companion, for the sake of his work he lived in a mostly retired fashion; even when not painting he habitually stayed in his working room surrounded by casts. Here he hardly admitted anyone, even intimate friends, and he kept his work methods secret, shared only with his assistants. He was full of pleasant witty sayings, whether to great personages or to others, but he himself seldom smiled.

Tintoretto maintained friendships with many writers and publishers, including Pietro Aretino, who became an important early patron.

== Marriages and children ==
In about 1560, Tintoretto married his second wife, Faustina de Vescovi, daughter of a Venetian nobleman who was the &quot;guardian grande&quot; of the Scuola Grande di San Marco. Faustina and he had many children, of whom three sons (Domenico, Marco, and Zuan Battista) and four daughters (Gierolima, Lucrezia, Ottavia, and Laura) survived to adulthood. She appears to have been a careful housekeeper and able to mollify her husband. Faustina made him wear the robe of a Venetian citizen when outdoors. If it rained, she tried to make him wear an outer garment that he resisted. When he prepared to leave the house, she would wrap money up for him in a handkerchief, expecting a strict accounting upon his return. Tintoretto&#x27;s customary reply was that he had spent it on alms for the poor or for prisoners.

Before his marriage to Faustina, Tintoretto had a daughter, Marietta Robusti, whose mother is not known. She became highly regarded as a painter, having been trained as an artist by Tintoretto, as he would later with her half-brothers Domenico and Marco. Marietta was a portrait painter of considerable skill, as well as a musician, vocalist, and instrumentalist. Few of her works are now traceable. As a girl, she used to accompany and assist her father at his work, dressed as a boy. Eventually, Marietta married a jeweller, Mario Augusta. Tradition suggests that as she lay in her final repose at the age of thirty, her heart-stricken father painted her final portrait among the many her father painted of her.

=== Death ===

After the completion of the &quot;Paradise&quot; Tintoretto rested for a while, and he never undertook any other work of importance, although there is no reason to suppose that his energies were exhausted if he had lived a little longer. In 1592, he became a member of the &quot;Scuola dei Mercanti&quot;.

In 1594, he was seized with severe stomach pains, complicated with fever, that prevented him from sleeping and almost from eating for a fortnight. He died on 31 May 1594. He was buried in the church of the Madonna dell&#x27;Orto by the side of his favourite daughter Marietta, who had died in 1590 at the age of thirty. 

In 1866, the grave of the Vescovi—his wife&#x27;s family—and Tintoretto was opened, and the remains of nine members of the joint families were found in it. The grave was then moved to a new location, to the right of the choir.

==Style==

Tintoretto&#x27;s style of painting is characterized by bold brushwork and the use of long strokes to define contours and highlights. His paintings emphasize the energy of human bodies in motion and often exploit extreme foreshortening and perspective effects to heighten the drama. Narrative content is conveyed by the gestures and dynamism of the figures rather than by facial expressions.

An agreement is extant showing a plan to finish two historical paintings—each containing twenty figures, seven being portraits—in a two-month period of time. Sebastiano del Piombo remarked that Tintoretto could paint in two days as much as himself in two years; Annibale Carracci that Tintoretto was in many of his pictures equal to Titian, in others inferior to Tintoretto. This was the general opinion of the Venetians, who said that he had three pencils—one of gold, the second of silver and the third of iron.Tintoretto&#x27;s pictorial wit is evident in compositions such as &quot;Saint George, Saint Louis, and the Princess&quot; (1553). He subverts the usual portrayal of the subject, in which Saint George slays the dragon and rescues the princess; here, the princess sits astride the dragon, holding a whip. The result is described by art critic Arthur Danto as having &quot;the edginess of a feminist joke&quot; as &quot;the princess has taken matters into her own hands ... George spreads his arms in a gesture of male helplessness, as his lance lies broken on the ground ...It was obviously painted with a sophisticated Venetian audience in mind.&quot;

A comparison of Tintoretto&#x27;s final &quot;The Last Supper&quot;—one of his nine known paintings on the subject— with Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s treatment of the same subject provides an instructive demonstration of how artistic styles evolved over the course of the Renaissance. Leonardo&#x27;s is all classical repose. The disciples radiate away from Christ in almost-mathematical symmetry. In the hands of Tintoretto, the same event becomes dramatic, as the human figures are joined by angels. A servant is placed in the foreground, perhaps in reference to the Gospel of John 13:14–16. In the restless dynamism of his composition, his dramatic use of light, and his emphatic perspective effects, Tintoretto seems a baroque artist ahead of his time.
Tintoretto was Venice&#x27;s most prolific painter of portraits during his career. Modern critics have often described his portraits as routine works, although his skill in depicting elderly men, such as &quot;Alvise Cornaro&quot; (1560/1565), has been widely admired. According to art historians Robert Echols and Frederick Ilchman, the many portraits from Tintoretto&#x27;s studio that were executed largely by assistants have hampered appreciation of his autograph portraits which, in sharp contrast to his narrative works, are understated and somber. Lawrence Gowing considered Tintoretto&#x27;s &quot;smouldering portraits of personalities who seemed consumed by their own fire&quot; to be his &quot;most irresistible&quot; works.

He painted two self-portraits. In the first (–47; Philadelphia Museum of Art), he presents himself without the trappings of status that were customary in self-portraits that came before. The image&#x27;s informality, the directness of the subject&#x27;s gaze, and the bold brushwork visible throughout were innovative—it has been called &quot;the first of many artfully unkempt images of the self that have come down through the centuries.&quot; The second self-portrait (; Louvre) is an austerely symmetrical depiction of the aged artist &quot;bleakly contemplating his mortality&quot;. Édouard Manet, who painted a copy of it, considered it &quot;one of the most beautiful paintings in the world.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2013, the Victoria and Albert Museum announced that the painting &quot;The Embarkation of St Helena in the Holy Land&quot; had been painted by Tintoretto (and not by his contemporary Andrea Schiavone, as previously thought) as part of a series of three paintings depicting the legend of St Helena and the Holy Cross.

In 2019, honouring the anniversary of the birth of Tintoretto, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, in cooperation with the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia organized a travelling exhibit, the first in the United States. The exhibition features nearly 50 paintings and more than a dozen works on paper spanning the artist&#x27;s entire career and ranging from regal portraits of Venetian aristocracy to religious and mythological narrative scenes.

<doc id="338824" wikidata="Q1773123" url="?curid=338824" title="Rannoch Moor">
<text>Rannoch Moor (; ) is an expanse of around of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, from where it extends into westerly Perth and Kinross, northerly Lochaber (in Highland), and the area of Highland Scotland toward its south-west, northern Argyll and Bute. Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation. Much of the western part of the moor lies within the Ben Nevis and Glen Coe National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland.

It is notable for its wildlife, and is particularly famous as being the sole British location for the Rannoch-rush, named after the moor. It was frequently visited by Horace Donisthorpe, who collected many unusual species of ants on the moor and surrounding hilly ground. Today it is still one of the few remaining habitats for &quot;Formica exsecta&quot;, the &quot;narrow-headed ant&quot;, although recent surveys have failed to produce any sign of &quot;Formica pratensis&quot;, which Donisthorpe recorded in the area in the early part of the 20th century.

== Geography ==
This expanse was at the heart of the last significant icefield in the UK during the Loch Lomond Stadial at the end of the last ice age. Once the great mass of ice had melted, the subsequent unburdening of the Earth&#x27;s crust resulted in a continuing rise in the land which is estimated to be of the order of 2–3 mm per year.

==Access==
The A82 road crosses western Rannoch Moor on its way to Glen Coe and Fort William, and the West Highland Line also crosses the moor. Peat deposits posed major difficulties to builders of roads and railways. When the West Highland Line was being built, its builders had to float the tracks on a mattress of tree roots, brushwood and thousands of tons of earth and ashes.

Corrour railway station, the UK&#x27;s highest, and one of its most remote being from the nearest public road, is located on this section of the line at . The line takes gentle curves totalling across the moorland. The desolate and isolated Gorton was a private railway station built near Meall a Ghortain which once housed a school for local railway workers&#x27; children, and still serves as the Gorton Crossing engineers&#x27; siding.

== In fiction ==
&quot;Kidnapped&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson.

According to Don Rosa, Castle McDuck, the ancestral home of Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s family, the Clan McDuck is located in Dismal Downs somewhere on Rannoch Moor.

In the Highlander novel, &quot;The Element of Fire&quot;, Duncan and Connor MacLeod track the antagonist Khordas to Rannoch Moor. There Duncan defeats Khordas&#x27; female companion, Nerissa. 

In the 1999 young adult fantasy novel &quot;Fire Bringer&quot; by David Clement-Davies, the story&#x27;s protagonist is named Rannoch. This may have been inspired by the name of the Moor, particularly in light of the book&#x27;s setting of 13th-century Scotland.

==Filming location==
The moor was used as a filming location for the television series &quot;Outlander&quot;, and also for a short scene in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;. Corrour railway station was used for the remote rural location scene in 1996&#x27;s &quot;Trainspotting&quot;.

<text>Toleration is when one allows or permits an action, idea, object, or person that they dislike or disagree with. Political scientist Andrew R. Murphy explains that &quot;We can improve our understanding by defining &#x27;toleration&#x27; as a set of social or political practices and &#x27;tolerance&#x27; as a set of attitudes.&quot; &quot;Random House Dictionary&quot; defines tolerance as &quot;a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, beliefs, practices, racial or ethnic origins, etc., differ from one&#x27;s own&quot;. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary associates toleration both with &quot;putting up with&quot; something undesirable, and with neglect or failure to prevent or alleviate it.

Both these concepts contain the idea of alterity: the state of &quot;otherness&quot;. Additional choices of how to respond to the &quot;other&quot;, beyond toleration, exist. Therefore, in some instances, toleration has been seen as &quot;a flawed virtue&quot; because it concerns acceptance of things that were better overcome. Toleration cannot, therefore, be defined as a universal good, and many of its applications and uses remain contested.

Religious toleration may signify &quot;no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful&quot;. Historically, most incidents and writings pertaining to religious toleration involve the status of minority and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant state religion; however, religion is also sociological, and the practice of toleration has always had a political aspect as well.

Toleration assumes a conflict over something important that cannot be resolved through normal negotiation without resorting to war or violence. As political lecturer Catriona McKinnon explains, when it comes to questions like what is &quot;the best way to live, the right things to think, the ideal political society, or the true road to salvation, no amount of negotiation and bargaining will bring them to an agreement without at least one party relinquishing the commitments that created the conflict in the first place. Such conflicts provide the circumstances of toleration... [and] are endemic in society.&quot; &quot;The urgency and relevance of this issue is only too obvious: without tolerance, communities that value diversity, equality, and peace could not persist.&quot;

An examination of the history of toleration includes its practice across various cultures. Toleration has evolved into a guiding principle, finding contemporary relevance in politics, society, religion, and ethnicity. It also applies to minority groups, including LGBT individuals. It is closely linked to concepts like human rights.

==Etymology==
Originally from the Latin (present participle of ; &quot;to bear, endure, tolerate&quot;), the word was first used in Middle French in the 14th century and in Early Modern English in the early 15th century. &quot;Toleration&quot; was first used in English in the 1510s to mean &quot;permission granted by authority, licence&quot; from the French (originally from the Latin past participle stem of , ), moving towards the meaning of &quot;forbearance, sufferance&quot; in the 1580s. The notion of religious toleration stems from Sebastian Castellio, as well as the Toleration Act 1688.

==France==
The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789), adopted by the National Constituent Assembly during the French Revolution, states in Article 10: &quot;No-one shall be interfered with for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their practice does not disturb public order as established by the law.&quot; (&quot;&quot;)

==In the 19th century==
===John Stuart Mill===
In &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859) John Stuart Mill states that opinions ought never to be suppressed, stating, &quot;Such prejudice, or oversight, when it [i.e. false belief] occurs, is altogether an evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always exempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good.&quot; He claims that there are three sorts of beliefs that can be had—wholly false, partly true, and wholly true—all of which, according to Mill, benefit the common good:

===Ernest Renan===

In his 1882 essay &quot;What is a Nation?&quot;, French historian and philosopher Ernest Renan proposed a definition of nationhood based on &quot;a spiritual principle&quot; involving shared memories rather than a common religious, racial, or linguistic heritage. Thus members of any religious group could participate fully in the nation&#x27;s life. &quot;You can be French, English, German, yet Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or practicing no religion.&quot;

==In the 20th century==
In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.
Though not formally legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or has influenced many national constitutions since 1948. It also serves as the foundation for a growing number of international treaties and national laws and international, regional, national, and sub-national institutions protecting and promoting human rights, including the freedom of religion.

==Modern analyses and critiques==
Contemporary commentators have highlighted situations in which toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of suttee (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the Mormon practice of polygamy. The French head scarf controversy represents a conflict between religious practice and the French secular ideal. Toleration of or intolerance toward the Romani people in European countries is a continuing issue. Pope Francis refers to the &quot;admirable creativity and generosity&quot; shown by people who put up with their lives in &quot;a seemingly undesirable environment&quot; and learn &quot;to live their lives amid disorder and uncertainty&quot;.

===Modern definition===

Historian Alexandra Walsham observes that the modern understanding of &quot;toleration&quot; may be very different from its historic meaning. Toleration in modern parlance has been analyzed as a component of a liberal or libertarian view of human rights. Hans Oberdiek writes, &quot;As long as no one is harmed or no one&#x27;s fundamental rights are violated, the state should keep hands off, tolerating what those controlling the state find disgusting, deplorable, or debased. For a long time, this has been the most prevalent defense of toleration by liberals... It is found, for example, in the writings of American philosophers John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Ronald Dworkin, Brian Barry, and a Canadian, Will Kymlicka, among others.&quot;

Isaiah Berlin attributed to Herbert Butterfield the notion that &quot;toleration... implies a certain disrespect. I tolerate your absurd beliefs and your foolish acts, though I know them to be absurd and foolish. Mill would, I think, have agreed.&quot; John Gray states that &quot;When we tolerate a practice, a belief or a character trait, we let something be that we judge to be undesirable, false, or at least inferior; our toleration expresses the conviction that, despite its badness, the object of toleration should be left alone.&quot; However, according to Gray, &quot;new liberalism – the liberalism of Rawls, Dworkin, Ackerman and suchlike&quot; – seems to imply that &quot;it is wrong for government to discriminate in favour of, or against, any form of life animated by a definite conception of the good&quot;.

John Rawls&#x27; &quot;theory of &#x27;political liberalism&#x27; conceives of toleration as a pragmatic response to the fact of diversity&quot;. Diverse groups learn to tolerate one another by developing &quot;what Rawls calls &#x27;overlapping consensus&#x27;: individuals and groups with diverse metaphysical views or &#x27;comprehensive schemes&#x27; will find reasons to agree about certain principles of justice that will include principles of toleration&quot;. Herbert Marcuse, in the 1965 book &quot;A Critique of Pure Tolerance&quot;, argued that &quot;pure tolerance&quot; that permits all can favor totalitarianism and tyranny of the majority, and insisted on &quot;repressive tolerance&quot; against them.

===Tolerating the intolerant===

Several philosophers, such as Michael Walzer, Karl Popper, and John Rawls, have discussed the paradox of tolerating intolerance. Walzer asks &quot;Should we tolerate the intolerant?&quot; He notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant, at least in some respects. Rawls argues that an intolerant sect should be tolerated in a tolerant society unless the sect directly threatens the security of other members of the society. He hypothetises that members of the intolerant sect in a tolerant society will, over time, acquire the tolerance of the wider society.

===Other criticisms and issues===
Toleration has been described as undermining itself via moral relativism: &quot;either the claim self-referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it. If we are skeptical about knowledge, then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good.&quot;

Ronald Dworkin argues that in exchange for toleration, minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an otherwise tolerant society. Dworkin has also questioned whether the United States is a &quot;tolerant secular&quot; nation, or is re-characterizing itself as a &quot;tolerant religious&quot; nation, based on the increasing re-introduction of religious themes into conservative politics. Dworkin concludes that &quot;the tolerant secular model is preferable, although he invited people to use the concept of personal responsibility to argue in favor of the tolerant religious model.&quot;

In &quot;The End of Faith&quot;, Sam Harris asserts that society should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified religious beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity, especially beliefs that promote violence.

<text>The Moon System of Embossed Reading (commonly known as the Moon writing, Moon alphabet, Moon script, Moon type, or Moon code) is a writing system for the blind, using embossed symbols mostly derived from the Latin script (but simplified). It is claimed by its supporters to be easier to understand than braille, though it is mainly used by people who have lost their sight as adults, and thus already have knowledge of the shapes of letters.

==History==
Moon type was developed by William Moon (1818—1894), a blind Englishman living in Brighton, East Sussex. After a bout of scarlet fever, Moon lost his sight at age 21 and became a teacher of blind children. He discovered that his pupils had great difficulty learning to read the existing styles of embossed reading codes, and devised his own system that would be &quot;open and clear to the touch.&quot;

Moon first formulated his ideas in 1843 and published the scheme in 1845. Moon is not as well known as braille, but it is a valuable alternative touch reading scheme for the blind or partially sighted people of any age.

Rather than the dots of braille type, Moon type is made up of raised curves, angles, and lines. As the characters are quite large and over half the letters bear a strong resemblance to the print equivalent, Moon has been found particularly suitable for those who lose their sight later in life or for people who may have a less keen sense of touch. It has also proved successful as a mode of literacy for children with additional physical and/or learning difficulties.

Schools can borrow very simple children&#x27;s books with added Moon type from the Clearvision Project in London.

===Foreign languages===

English Christian missionaries in Ningbo (Ningpo), China, during the Qing dynasty used Moon type to teach blind locals how to read Ningbo. Missionaries who spoke the Ningbo dialect ran the &quot;Home for Indigent Old People&quot; where most of the inmates were blind. In 1874, an English missionary taught a young blind man to read romanised Ningbo written in Moon type. The Gospel of Luke was then transcribed into two large volumes of Moon type. A Swiss missionary placed notices on placards throughout Ningbo stating that he would give food and money to the blind people who visited. The Gospel of Mark was transcribed into Moon type using romanized Mandarin, however, without the tone marks. Missionary Hudson Taylor, who had been involved with the transcription of the gospels, did not find tone marks necessary, as the romanised Ningbo vernacular has never used tone marks. However, aspirated consonants were distinguished.

==Characters==
===Letters===

As with braille, there is a Grade 1 using one Moon character per one Latin character and a Grade 2 using contractions and shorthand that make texts more compact and faster to read, though requiring more study.

===Numbers===
Similarly to Braille, the initial version of Moon type used the first ten letters with a &quot;number start&quot; symbol as digits.

A later version used different symbols for each digit (&quot;StaffsMaths&quot;). These symbols are more complex to print.

===Punctuation===
The type also includes punctuation.

===Dotty Moon===
Besides the original type formed by lines, there is the possibility of using certain Braille embossers to produce dot patterns (Dotty Moon or Dotted Moon) in the shape of Moon characters. The patterns are disposed as a 5x5 grid.

==Direction==
Initially the text changed direction (but not character orientation) at the end of the lines. Special embossed lines connected the end of a line and the beginning of the next. However, around 1990, it changed to a left-to-right orientation.

==Reception==
The Royal National Institute for the Blind for wider universality prefers braille.

<doc id="338831" wikidata="Q202216" url="?curid=338831" title="Overseas departments and regions of France">
<text>The overseas departments and regions of France (, ; DROM) are departments of the French Republic which are outside the continental Europe situated portion of France, known as &quot;metropolitan France&quot;. The distant parts have exactly the same status as mainland France&#x27;s regions and departments. The French Constitution provides that, in general, French laws and regulations (France&#x27;s civil code, penal code, administrative law, social laws, tax laws, etc.) apply to French overseas regions the same as in metropolitan France, but can be adapted as needed to suit the region&#x27;s particular needs. Hence, the local administrations of French overseas regions cannot themselves pass new laws. On occasion referendums are undertaken to re-assess the sentiment in local status.

Since March 2011, the five overseas departments and regions of France are:

* French Guiana in South America;
* Guadeloupe in the Caribbean;
* Martinique in the Caribbean;
* Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa;
* Réunion in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa.

== History ==
France&#x27;s earliest, short-lived attempt at setting up overseas departments was after Napoleon&#x27;s conquest of the Republic of Venice in 1797, when the hitherto Venetian Ionian Islands fell to the French Directory and were organised as the departments of Mer-Égée, Ithaque and Corcyre. In 1798, the Russian Admiral Fyodor Ushakov evicted the French from these islands, and though France regained them via the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, the three departments were not revived.

Under the 1947 Constitution of the Fourth Republic, the French colonies of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean; French Guiana in South America; and Réunion in the Indian Ocean were defined as overseas departments, joining Algeria in North Africa, which had previously been divided into three departments and a territory in 1848.

Since 1982, following the French government&#x27;s policy of decentralisation, overseas departments have elected regional councils with powers similar to those of the regions of metropolitan France. As a result of a constitutional revision that occurred in 2003, these regions are now to be called &quot;overseas regions&quot;; indeed, the new wording of the Constitution gives no precedence to the terms &quot;overseas department&quot; or &quot;overseas region&quot;, though the latter is still virtually unused by the French media.

The overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon was an overseas department from 1976 to 1985. All five of France&#x27;s overseas departments have between 200,000 and 1,000,000 people each, whereas Saint Pierre and Miquelon has only about 6,000, and the smaller collectivity unit therefore seemed more appropriate for the islands.

The overseas collectivity of Mayotte held a referendum on 29 March 2009. Of the votes, 95% were in favor of becoming an overseas department. Mayotte became an overseas department on 31 March 2011.

== Geography and characteristics ==

Each overseas department is the sole department in its own overseas region () with powers identical to the regions of metropolitan France. Because of the one-to-one correspondence, informal usage does not distinguish the two, and the French media use the term (&quot;DOM&quot;) almost exclusively.

As integral parts of France and the European Union, overseas departments are represented in the National Assembly, Senate, and Economic and Social Council. The areas also vote to elect members of the European Parliament (MEP), and also use the euro as their currency. The overseas departments and regions are not the same as the overseas collectivities, which have a semi-autonomous status.

Guadeloupe and Réunion each have separate departmental and regional councils, while in Mayotte, Guiana and Martinique, the two layers of government are consolidated so one body wields both sets of powers. The overseas departments acquired these additional powers in 1982, when France&#x27;s decentralisation policy dictated that they be given elected regional councils and other regional powers; however, the term &quot;overseas region&quot; was only introduced with the French constitutional amendment of 28 March 2003.

Due to distance from the EU and local proximity some areas participate in economic fora and organizations of mutual interest geographically close-by. Such as Martinique and Guadeloupe taking part in both the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Association of Caribbean States (ACS); or French Polynesia taking part in the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF).

<text>William Moon (18 December 1818 – 9 October 1894) was an Englishman who created Moon type, the first widely used practical reading alphabet for the blind.

== Life and career ==
Moon was born in Horsmonden, Kent. As a small child, he lost sight in one eye from scarlet fever, and by the age of twenty-one he had become totally blind. He moved in with his widowed mother and sister in Brighton, East Sussex. He became a teacher, and taught boys how to read using the existing embossed reading codes.

Moon realised that the boys found these reading codes difficult to learn. He devised a new system, Moon type, based on a simplified Latin alphabet, which he designed to be easier to learn. He first formulated his ideas in 1843 and they were published in 1845. Moon type was subsequently replaced in popularity by Braille but it is still important for people who have difficulty reading Braille.

Moon achieved several distinctions during his lifetime: he was elected to fellowships of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Society of Arts in 1852 and 1857 respectively; he was also awarded an honorary LLD degree by the University of Philadelphia in 1871.

==Family==
Moon was twice married, in 1843 to Mary Ann Caudle, daughter of a Brighton surgeon, who died in 1864; and in 1866 to Anna Maria Elsdale, a granddaughter of William Leeves, the composer of &#x27;Auld Robin Gray&#x27;.
By the first marriage he had a son, Robert Charles Moon, who was of great assistance to him in arranging his type to foreign languages, and was as of 1901 a physician in Philadelphia; and a daughter, who was as of 1901 superintending the undertaking that Moon inaugurated.

<doc id="338834" wikidata="Q7963019" url="?curid=338834" title="Walled villages of Hong Kong">
<text>Most of the walled villages of Hong Kong are located in the New Territories.
==History==
During the Ming and Qing dynasties, coastal areas in Guangdong experienced numerous attacks from pirates. The area of present-day Hong Kong was particularly vulnerable to such incursions. The area&#x27;s winding shores, hilly land, and islands, as well as its distance from administrative centres, made the territory of Hong Kong an excellent hideout for pirates. Villages, both Punti and Hakka, built walls against them. Some villages even protected themselves with cannons. Over time, the walls of most walled villages have been partly or totally demolished.

==Names==
In Punti Cantonese, &quot;wai&quot; (, &#x27;walled&#x27;) and &quot;tsuen&quot; (, &#x27;village&#x27;) were once synonyms. Most place names which include the word &quot;wai&quot; were at some point in time a walled village.

==Conservation==
Two heritage trails of Hong Kong feature walled villages:
* Ping Shan Heritage Trail. One walled village: Sheung Cheung Wai ().
* Lung Yeuk Tau Heritage Trail. Five walled villages: Lo Wai (), Ma Wat Wai (), San Wai (, also called Kun Lung Wai ), Tung Kok Wai (, also known as Ling Kok Wai), Wing Ning Wai ().

==Features==
Walled villages in Hong Kong are characterised by row houses arranged in a square or rectangular block, where the parallel rows of houses are separated by narrow lanes.


==Notable walled villages==

===Kat Hing Wai===
Kat Hing Wai () is a noted Punti walled village in Yuen Long District of Hong Kong. It often mistakenly believed to be Hakka, whose people have similar traditions. However the Punti people were from Southern China and the first to settle in Hong Kong. Kat Hing Wai&#x27;s residents speak Cantonese, rather than Hakka. Popularly known as &quot;Kam Tin&quot;, from the name of the area, it is home to about 400 descendants of the Tang Clan, who built the village back in the 17th century.

Kat Hing Wai is a rectangular (100 m x 90 m) walled village. As a family stronghold, Kat Hing Wai has served the Tangs well through the centuries, protecting the residents against bandits, rival clans, and wild tigers. During the Qing dynasty, a five-metre high blue brick wall and four cannon towers were added to defend against bandits. Today, the village is still completely surrounded by 18-inch-thick walls, outside which are the remains of a moat. However, most houses within the walls have been rebuilt in recent years. There is only one narrow entrance, with a pair of iron gates.

===Tsang Tai Uk===
Tsang Tai Uk (), also known as Shan Ha Wai (), is another well-known Hakka walled village in Hong Kong, and one of the best preserved. It is located in Sha Tin, close to the south of the Pok Hong Estate, not far from the Lion Rock Tunnel Road. Built as a stronghold for the Tsang Clan, its construction started in 1847 and took around 20 years to complete. The village is built with granite, grey bricks, and solid timber.

===Sheung Shui Wai===

Sheung Shui Wai (), also known as Sheung Shui Heung (), is one of the very few rural settlements having retained its original moat which was built in 1646. Characterized by its magnificent moat and landscape setting, the walled village is the core of the Liu clan, of which ancestors came originally from Fujian during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). The village is located in Sheung Shui.

===Fanling Wai===
Fanling Wai () is a walled village in Fanling built by the Pang () Clan. It is recognisable with the distinctive pond and layout including features such as cannons and watchtowers. All these elements were crafted to form an integral part of the village setting. Fanling Wai is the centre of the Pang Clan who arrived in Hong Kong late during the Song dynasty.

===Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen===

Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen () is a walled village in Wong Tai Sin, New Kowloon. It is the only walled village left in the urban built-up areas of Hong Kong. Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen is also the only remaining walled village in Kowloon. It is located near San Po Kong. On 18 July 2007, the government announced its plans to redevelop Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen.

==List of walled villages==
Remaining walled villages in Hong Kong include:

===North District===

===Sha Tin District===
===Tai Po District===

===Tsuen Wan District===
===Tuen Mun District===
===Wong Tai Sin District===
===Yuen Long District===
==Unconfirmed==
The following villages are likely to have been walled villages, although it is not confirmed:
==Other fenced villages==
A number of old villages in Hong Kong have a wall, built for defensive or feng shui purposes, and an entrance gate, but are not considered as traditional walled villages. They include:

==Non-walled &#x27;wai&#x27;==
The following villages are neither current nor former walled villages, despite the &quot;wai&quot; in their name:

* Fan Ling Nam Wai ()
* Fan Ling Pak Wai ()
* Fung Ka Wai ()
* Ha Wai ()
* Hok Tau Wai ()
* Kam Tsin Wai ()
* Kan Tau Wai ()
* Kat O Sheung Wai ()
* Kau Lung Hang Kau Wai ()

<doc id="338842" wikidata="Q23187" url="?curid=338842" title="Canosa di Puglia">
<text>Canosa di Puglia, generally known simply as Canosa (), is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Barletta-Andria-Trani, Apulia, southern Italy. It is located between Bari and Foggia, on the northwestern edge of the plateau of the Murgia which dominates the Ofanto valley and the extensive plains of Tavoliere delle Puglie, ranging from Mount Vulture at the Gargano, to the Adriatic coast. Canosa, the Roman Canusium, is considered the principal archaeological center of Apulia, and is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in Italy. A number of vases and other archaeological finds are located in local museums and private collections. It is not far from the position on the Ofanto River where the Romans found refuge after the defeat of the Battle of Cannae and is the burial place of Bohemund I of Antioch.

==Name==
Canosa is the Italian development of the Latin &#x27;, derived from the Greek &quot;Kanýsion&quot; (), whose origin is uncertain. According to the Latin commentator Servius, Canusium derived from &#x27; (&quot;dog&quot;), an animal associated with the local worship of Aphrodite. Other derivations include from Greek &quot;kháneon&quot; (, &quot;wicker basket&quot;), from the abundant wicker growing along the Ofanto; the Hebrew &quot;chanuth&quot; (&quot;tavern&quot;); and the Etruscan name &quot;Canzna&quot;.

==Geography==
===Territory===
Canosa sits on the right bank of the Ofanto river (the ancient &quot;&quot;) and is nearly from the Adriatic Sea. The town sits upon the Murgia plateau, between above sea level. The city is built on a mostly sandy or clay surface that covers a limestone layer (&quot;calcareniti of Gravina&quot;) which in turn constitutes the typical white-yellowish tuff and is easily collapsible.
This morphological feature allowed the underground construction of artificial grottoes (used in the 19th century as cellars), and the creation of a Hypogeum. The tuff derived from the excavations has gone towards the construction of buildings on the surface. There are risks of subsidence due to the presence of caves and underground channels typical of karst environments. The buildings of the town of Canosa are considered high risk for collapse. In recent years there have been many building failures and disruptions of roads. The area extends south to the slopes of the Murgia, and is mostly flat. The basins of Rendina and Locone contribute to the large area .

===Climate===
Canosa has a typical temperate climate, mild spring and autumn, and cold winters and mild summers.
The monthly average temperature is strongly influenced by the Murgiano Range from in January, to in August. The average annual rainfall is of rainfall, distributed mainly in the period from September to April. Climate classification of Canosa is Climate zone C.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The ancient Greeks and Romans ascribed the foundation of Canusion or Canusium to the Homeric hero Diomedes, but archeologists have established human presence in the area back to the 7th millennium BC. The Diomedea fields were one of the main centers of the Dauni, a northern branch of the Iapyges, during the Neolithic (6th to 4th millennia BC). Toppicelli on the Ofantina plain has revealed buildings and tombs of a rich aristocracy that also seem related to this group.

Excavations have also discovered metal and amber designs which appear Etruscan.

===Antiquity===

Canusion became an important commercial center for craftsman, especially of ceramics and pottery. Probably settled by the Pelasgians, it became a Greek polis by the time of the development of Magna Grecia. This Hellenistic city—located at the site of the present urban core—first appears in the historical record as an ally of the Samnites in their wars against Rome but was either subdued or voluntarily switched sides in , after which it served as a Roman ally. Following Hannibal&#x27;s victory over the consuls Paullus and Varro at nearby Cannae, Canosa protected the fleeing remnants of the Roman army within its walls. In the second year of the Social War, it joined the rebels and successfully resisted a Roman siege. During that conflict or the civil wars that followed, it seems to have suffered greatly and been much reduced in size, although it improved its status to a self-governing municipality (&quot;&quot;) in and protected those privileges throughout the conflicts. A list of its local senators has been recovered from the ruins.

The town was a center for agricultural production and trade, particularly in Apulian wool. Horace&#x27;s &quot;Satires&quot; complain of the area&#x27;s gritty bread and bad water but note that the people were still fluent in both Latin and Greek. Its coins continued to bear Greek inscriptions through the Roman period. The Via Traiana reached the town in and the ruins of a large gateway still honor that emperor. The city also boasted a very large amphitheater. It became a Roman colony (&quot;&quot;) under Marcus Aurelius. Herodes Atticus oversaw the process and constructed an aqueduct, completed in 141. Antoninus Pius made it the capital of the Province of Apulia and Calabria. Towards the end of the 3rd century it became the capital of Apulia and Calabria II Royal.

===Middle Ages===

The city continued to flourish into the early medieval period, when it became known as the &quot;city of bishops&quot;. Some of its bishops are known from the 4th century. Bishop Stercorius took part in the 343 Council of Sardica, and Bishop Probus intervened decisively against a Spanish bishop who wanted to name his own successor in a council convoked at Rome by Pope Hilarius in 465. The diocese reached its apogee under St Sabinus (514–566), who subsequently was honored as the town&#x27;s patron saint.

The area suffered severely at the hands of the Lombards during the invasion that established the Duchy of Benevento and the Muslim invasions which followed. In the early 9th century, Muslims entirely destroyed the town and, in 844, Bishop Angelarius translated the relics of  Rufinus, Memorus, and Sabinus to Bari. Soon after, Pope Sergius II confirmed him as the bishop of Bari and Canosa, a united title borne by Bari&#x27;s archbishops until 1986. (It remains a titular see.)

In 963, Canosa was rebuilt at a site below the former Roman city. It remained a Lombard gastaldate until the Norman conquest that established the Kingdom of Sicily. Under Bohemund I of Antioch (d. 1111), son of Robert Guiscard, it regained some of its earlier importance. The 5-domed cathedral of St Sabinus was completed in 1101. Bohemund&#x27;s tomb is located just to its south. Following the extirpation of the Hohenstaufens, however, it again went into decline.

===Modernity===

The ruins and settlement of Canosa were repeatedly damaged by earthquakes, particularly those in 1361, 1456, 1627, 1659, 1694, and 1851. The town was also repeatedly sacked, notably by the Tarantini in 1451 and by Napoleon in 1803. As a fief, it was controlled by the Casati, the Orsini of , the Grimaldi of Monaco, the Gemmis family of Castelfoce, the Affaitati of Barletta, and the Capece Minutolo of Naples. Tiberio Capece was named &quot;prince of Canosa&quot; in 1712.

After the Italian Wars of Independence and the disastrous earthquake in 1851, Canosa remained predominantly bourgeois town as demonstrated by the construction of palaces. Virtually unscathed by World War I, the town suffered the effects of the 1930 Irpinia earthquake, which caused enormous damage.

On 6 November 1943, during World War II, the area was bombed by the Allies shortly after the armistice of 8 September. Some buildings were damaged, including the churches of San Francesco and San Biagio and the Town Hall, and 57 people lost their lives. In April 2001 the City of Canosa was awarded the bronze medal for Civil Valor in remembrance of the tragedy. On 17 September 1962, by decree of the President, Canosa was awarded the title of City for its historical traditions and the merits acquired by the community. In 1980 Canosa was again damaged by an earthquake.

Currently the economy of Canosa is based mainly on agriculture, with a service sector (archaeological, tourism) and industry and handicrafts, including textiles, food processing and manufacturing.

==Main sights==
===Religious architecture===

====Cathedral of San Sabino====
The Cathedral of San Sabino was founded in the 8th century by the Lombards Duke Arechis II of Benevento, after the abandonment of early Christian sites in San Leucio and St. Peter. Originally dedicated to Saints John and Paul, was named after Saint Sabinus of Canosa on 7 September 1101, by Pope Paschal II, some four hundred years after the transfer of the saint&#x27;s remains in the crypt. It was recognized as a cathedral in 1916 by Pope Benedict XV.

The plan of the basilica is a Latin cross, covered by five domes and an apse lit by three windows, whose central body is covered with a stained-glass window depicting the patron saint. It is an example of Romanesque/Byzantine architecture. Below the chancel are the crypt, shrine of the saint. The arches are supported by marble columns with Corinthian capitals, which were retrieved from devastated ancient monuments. The cathedral lies three feet below the square.

After the earthquake of 1851, the cathedral was damaged and the restoration work led to an expansion of the Latin cross, as well as the reconstruction of the facade in local tuff with three portals, each corresponding to the aisles.
The chapels contain in order: a baptismal font, a fresco, an altar dedicated to Our Lady of the Fountain (protectress of Canosa) whose icon came after the First Crusade, in the adjacent Mausoleum of Bohemond, the wooden statue and a painting of Alphonsus Maria de Liguori, and the tomb of Blessed Father Antonio Maria Losito (1838–1917).

The left aisle houses the tomb of the Bishop of Lecce Archbishop Francesco Minerva (1904–2004) following three chapels: one containing the relics, chalices, crucifixes, and a silver bust of the saint enclosed by an iron grating, and the other dedicated to Saint Anthony (but with canvas representing Saint Francis of Assisi), the third devoted to Saint Anne. On the left arm of a Latin cross are two other chapels that of the St. Sacramento containing the statue of the Sacred Heart and the other of Saint Joseph.

The presbytery has a high altar with ciborium, set on a marble base with three steps, surmounted by a canopy supported by four red marble columns with Corinthian capitals, octagonal pyramid in two sections held up a total of 48 columns of the same marble, very similar to that in the Basilica of San Nicola di Bari.

====Mausoleum of Bohemond====

Accessible from the right transept of the cathedral is the Mausoleum of Bohemond (visitors must ask a church official to unlock the door which gives access.) Erected sometime after 1111, the little building has an upper part characterized by a polygonal drum surmounted by a hemispherical dome. Opposite the door to the Mausoleum is a stone carved heraldic device, a Lion Rampant, the style of which appears contemporary with Bohemond, and could therefore represent his personal coat of arms. An asymmetrical bronze double door (now preserved in the side chapel in the adjoining Basilica of Our Lady of the Fountain) was probably created by Roger Melfi (11th century).

Its construction was commissioned by Raffaele Lembo, a wealthy local grain merchant, and dates to 1923. The draft prepared by engineer and architect Arturo Boccasini of Barletta, had designed the Teatro Di Lillo of Barletta and had collaborated on the project of Teatro Margherita di Bari. The theater was opened in late 1926 when, with scarce economic resources, they completed part of the structure including without ornaments and decorations. Purchased by the City of Canosa and delivered to the city on 5 February 2005, the historic theater will be completely renovated and restored to house performances again.
In May 2006 the renovation work were frozen after of an exceptional archaeological discovery, which was found under the gallery of the theater. This is a complicated intersection of Imperial age with some structures being from the Archaic Age (8th-7th centuries BC).

===Other===

====Villa Comunale====
The Villa Comunale, the center of Canosa, has its origins in the 19th century. Mayor Vincent Sinesi who in 1888 arranged the building adjacent to the Cathedral and the Mausoleum of Bohemond to be donated to the municipality by a few Canosa families.

The lapidarium is composed of a remarkable archaeological heritage with Dauna and Roman inscriptions, funerary reliefs, capitals and columns, lintels, and the well of the imperial villas.

===Archaeological sites===
==== Castle ====
The &quot;castle&quot; is actually the acropolis of ancient Canosa (&quot;Castrum Canus&quot;). The three great towers are the ruins of the eponymous estate located atop the hill overlooking the valley Ofantina. Originally a place of worship and pre-Roman fort, built of tufa blocks was rebuilt as a bastion of the same materials by the Grimaldi. Last owners, from 1856, were the Prince of Canosa Capece Minutolo of Naples, and remained until 1948. The wear of the blocks that compose it and the color denotes the passage of these various civilizations that have developed the structure in different epochs. The castle has also reported damage after the devastating bombing of the Second World War. Along the steep hill of the Acropolis, there is the old part of the country, with its narrow streets and staircases. At the southern base lie the remains of a Roman amphitheater.

====Hypogeum and catacombs====

Canosa has ancient Hypogeum (many probably still hidden). These were used first by Dauni as pagan catacombs, and, within them, celebrated funerary cults, demonstrating an advanced civilization in the vast era from 6000 BC to 2nd century AD). The burials in the tombs continued to Roman times. The tombs contained, in addition to the deceased (often found in the fetal position), personal items found in urns or deposited in niches. Over the years, however, many of these artifacts (including precious jewelry in gold and bronze, pottery, red figures and askos) have been lost (or in private hands) due to grave robbers. Often these sites have frescoes with an allegorical passage of the deceased to take in the afterlife (for ). The most important are those of the Cerberus, Lagrasta, Boccaforno and the Hoplite. Other exhibits recovered at the local Museum.

Not far from the town lies in the depths of clay soil, the necropolis of Santa Sofia. Used around the 4th century AD, for early Christians, it extended over other tombs dating back to the time of the persecution against the Christians. It was discovered around 1960 and is undergoing restoration.
Other hypogeum and catacombs include:
*Ori Tomb (4th century BC)
*Ipogei Monterisi-Rossignoli (4th century BC)
*Varrese Tomb (4th century BC)
*Hypogeum Cerberus (4th century BC)
*Ipogeo Scocchera A (4th century BC)
*Ipogeo Scocchera B (called Ipogeo Boccaforno, 4th century BC)
*Ipogei Casieri (4th century BC)
*Hypogeum Vessel Dario (4th century BC)
*Ipogei Lagrasta (2nd century BC)
*Ipogeo dell&#x27;Oplita (2nd century BC)
*Ipogeo Matarrese
*Ipogeo Reimers
*Tomb of Largo Constantinople (3rd century BC)
*Necropolis of Santa Sofia (2nd-4th century AD)

====Temples and archaic churches====

=====Basilica di San Leucio=====

The Basilica of San Leucio is one of the greatest examples of early Christian architecture in Apulia. A pagan temple until the 2nd century AD, probably dedicated to Minerva, was transformed into a Christian Basilica between the 4th and 5th centuries AD.
The structure is the result of merging the cultures of Magna Graecia and Italica consisting of a cell dedicated to worship located between two large rooms, with polychrome mosaics, tufa plastered figured capitals and painted columns in Doric – Ionic.
The early Christian Basilica of San Leucio was built on a Hellenistic temple. Its construction reused the already existing walls, columns and capitals. The floor plan is called a double envelope consists of an outer wall of square shape of per side with exedra on each side within which there is a second concentric squares with colonnade exedras. The architecture of the basilica is of oriental inspiration, with preference for large color spaces. In the 9th century a chapel was built adjoining the apse for burial rites.

=====Basilica di San Pietro=====
The Basilica di San Pietro was the first cathedral of the Christian era, then transformed into a tomb of Saint Sabino (556), patron of Canosa.
The complex is with three naves, apse and narthex of St. Peter&#x27;s, preceded by a large atrium portico and bordered by a residential building and several other structures used in cemetery functions: a mausoleum, the Sepulchre of Bishop Sabino, a large brick kiln devoted to cooking and a domus, used probably as a bishop&#x27;s residence. Also present are mosaics and Doric-Ionic capitals. Since 2001 the entire area is ongoing systematic excavation by the University of Foggia and the University of Bari.

=====Baptistry of San Giovanni=====
The main body of the twelve-sided shape, contained a heptagonal baptismal font. The compositions were mainly in marble and tuff. The columns that support the barrel vault was damaged over time, as they have lost the gold mosaics that once covered it. Corresponding to the cardinal points, left four small dodecagon aisles to form a structure of a Greek cross. In the 1800s, it was used as a mill. Nevertheless, such use did not affect the status of the building. Since 2001 it is the subject of research by the University of Foggia. Recently, under the Baptistry, have yielded two distinct levels of an early Christian church.

=====Temple of Jupiter &quot;Toro&quot;=====
The Roman temple of Jupiter &quot;Toro&quot;, a peripteral temple with six columns on the short sides and ten on the long sides, and a brick staircase, took its name from a statue of Jupiter found at the excavation in 1978.

=====Other sites=====

Among other monuments are the Ofanto Roman Bridge (1st century AD), which allowed the passage of the Via Traiana from one side of the river and was used for road traffic until the 1970s. It was reconstructed in the Middle Ages and restored again in 1759. The base consists of four pillars shaped like a spearhead and five mixed arches.
Notable are the Tower and Mausoleums, Casieri Bagnoli and Barbarossa, and the Arch of Gaius Terentius Varro, opus latericium and the opus reticulatum monuments dedicated to the passage of the Roman consul in the Battle of Cannae. The first three sites preserve the remains of some of the fallen in the battle.
Finally, the Roman Baths (Ferrara and Lomuscio) located in the city center came to light in the 1950s. They have enriched apse mosaics.

== Languages ==
The dialect is a primary Italo-Romance dialect arising directly from the Vulgar Latin spoken in ancient Canusium. Linguistically, part of the southern dialects spoken in North Central Apulia.

The &#x27;Canosina&#x27; gastronomy is strongly linked to rural and Mediterraneans culinary traditions.
One of the most characteristic is the burned flour of wheat (in the Apulian dialect gren IARS): A dark meal of humble origins, obtained from the grain recovered from the burning of stubble after harvest, from which it was produced the characteristic dark color meal. This recovery was done by people who could not afford the &quot;normal&quot; flour. The most original and popular products that are obtained by mixing equal parts white flour and wheat flour are burned dragged (in dialect strasc-net) with prosciutto and bread (in dialect ppen to prusutt) to make a dark bread mixed with white.

<text>Joanna David (born Joanna Elizabeth Hacking; 17 January 1947) is an English actress, best known for her television work.

==Early life and education==
David was born in Lancaster, England, daughter of Major John Almond Hacking and Davida Elizabeth, née Nesbitt. She was educated at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Elmhurst Ballet School in Birmingham, the Royal Academy of Dance, and the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art.

== Career ==
Her first major television role was as Elinor Dashwood in the BBC&#x27;s 1971 dramatisation of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; followed a year later by &quot;War and Peace&quot;, in which she played Sonya. David also appeared in the TV series &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (BBC), and in two episodes of &quot;Colditz&quot;, (&quot;Missing, Presumed Dead&quot; and &quot;Odd Man In&quot;, 1972) as Cathy Carter, the wife of Flt. Lt. Simon Carter (played by David McCallum). 

In 1975, she played Theo Dane in the BBC&#x27;s television adaptation of &quot;Ballet Shoes&quot; by Noel Streatfeild. 32 years later in 2007, her daughter, Emilia Fox, starred in a new adaptation of the same book. 
In 1976, David starred as Marian Pearce, a mysterious and traumatised young inmate who is unable to speak, in an episode of the women&#x27;s prison drama &quot;Within These Walls&quot;; she would go on to reprise this memorable role in a later episode, screened in 1978.

In 1978, David appeared in the mini series &quot;Lillie&quot; as Jeanne Marie, the daughter of Lillie Langtry. The following year, she played the heroine of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot;, opposite Jeremy Brett in the BBC miniseries of the same name. In 1985 she appeared as Dolly in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. In 1987, she acted in the &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple&quot; episode, &quot;4:50 from Paddington&quot;, as Emma Crackenthorpe.

More recent appearances include the BBC comedy series &quot;Never Better&quot;, &quot;Mutual Friends&quot;, and &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; (2014, series 3, episode 8).

She gradually moved on to more mature parts and appeared as Mrs. Gardiner in the acclaimed 1995 BBC TV series of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, in which her daughter Emilia Fox had her first major television role as Georgiana Darcy. In 1998, she appeared in the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; episode &quot;Written in Blood&quot; as Amy Lyddiard. In 2009, she appeared in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Woman in Mind&quot;.

Her film appearances have included roles in &quot;The Smashing Bird I Used to Know&quot; (1969), the horror short &quot;Sleepwalker&quot; (1984), &quot;Comrades&quot; (1986), &quot;Secret Friends&quot; (1991), &quot;Rogue Trader&quot; (1999), &quot;Cotton Mary&quot; (1999), &quot;The Soul Keeper&quot; (2002, as the mother of her real-life daughter Emilia) and &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; (2006). She played Mother Julian in the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; episode, &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; (2011). In 2013, she appeared in &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; as Duchess of Yeovil in two episodes and also in the &quot;Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple&quot; episode, &quot;Greenshaw’s Folly&quot;, as Grace Ritchie. She appeared in the &quot;Murderous Marriage&quot; episode of &quot;Agatha Raisin&quot; as Lady Derrington in 2016.

<text>The Goddess of Democracy, also known as the Goddess of Democracy and Freedom, the Spirit of Democracy, and the Goddess of Liberty (; ), was a statue created during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The statue was constructed over four days out of foam and papier-mâché over a metal armature and was unveiled and erected on Tiananmen Square on May 30, 1989. The constructors decided to make the statue as large as possible to try to dissuade the government from dismantling it: the government would either have to destroy the statue—an action which would potentially fuel further criticism of its policies—or leave it standing. Nevertheless, the statue was destroyed on June 4, 1989, by soldiers clearing the protesters from Tiananmen square. Since its destruction, numerous replicas and memorials have been erected around the world, including in Hong Kong, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Vancouver.

==Construction==

Near the end of May 1989 the Democracy Movement in Tiananmen Square, though still attracting huge throngs of participants, was losing momentum in the face of government inaction on reforms. One historian said the movement &quot;appeared to have sunk to its nadir. The number of students in the Square continued to decline. Those remaining seemed to have no clear leadership: Chai Ling, tired and disheartened by the difficulties of keeping the Movement together, had resigned from her post...[the Square] had degenerated into a shantytown, strewn with litter and permeated by the stench of garbage and overflowing portable toilets... Tianamen, once a magnet pulling in huge throngs, had become only an unkempt campground of little interest to citizens, many of whom considered the struggle for democracy lost.&quot; It was at this point that the revealing of the statue of the &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot; reinvigorated the movement in the Square.

The statue was built by students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts beginning on May 27 at their University. It was built in hopes of bolstering the movement which &quot;seemed to be losing some of its momentum; the students suspected that the government was waiting for them to tire and leave the Square&quot;. Working with a sense of urgency and expedience to create the model the larger statue would be based on, the students reworked an academic exercise built to demonstrate the effect of the distribution of weight on a piece: &quot;a half-meter [20&quot;] high clay sculpture of a man grasping a pole with two raised hands and leaning his weight on it.&quot; &quot;The students cut off the lower part of the pole and added a flame at the top to turn it into a torch; they leaned the sculpture into a more upright position; they changed the man&#x27;s face to a woman&#x27;s, and otherwise added feminine characteristics to make the him into a her.&quot; They then transferred the measurements of the model, adjusting them for the larger proportion, to the foam that once carved became the monument. Jeff Widener, known for his iconic Tank Man photograph, took other photographs of the fateful rally, including two widely publicized images of the &quot;Goddess&quot;; one under construction, and another in context of the demonstration.

While many people have noted its resemblance to the Statue of Liberty, a sculptor present during its construction, Tsao Tsing-yuan, has written that the students decided to model their statue on the Statue of Liberty because they were concerned that it would be unoriginal and &quot;too openly pro-American.&quot; Tsao further notes the influence on the statue of the work of Russian sculptor Vera Mukhina, associated with the school of revolutionary realism. Her piece &quot;Worker and Kolkhoz Woman&quot; was especially influential for their statue&#x27;s head and facial features.
When the time came to transport the pieces of the statue to the Square, the State Security Bureau, hearing of the students&#x27; intention, declared that any truck drivers assisting them would lose their licenses. The students hired six Beijing carts (similar to a bicycle rickshaw except with a flat cart instead of a passenger area). Four carried the statue segments, and two carried the tools required to install it. The students had leaked a false itinerary of the move to throw off the authorities and moved the statue&#x27;s three segments from the Central Academy of Fine Arts to the Square by another route. Students of the other academies assisting in the construction linked arms around the carts for protection in case the authorities arrived. At dusk on May 29, with fewer than 10,000 protesters remaining in the square the Art Students constructed bamboo scaffolding and then began assembling the statue. Troops called in to disrupt the movement and construction of the statue were &quot;stalled &quot;en route&quot; by Beijing residents.&quot; By the early morning of May 30, the statue was fully assembled in Tiananmen Square. It broke up the north–south axis of the Square, standing between the Monument to the People&#x27;s Heroes, and the Tiananmen Gate (which it faced looking at its large photograph of Mao Zedong). Whether the students had intended it or not &quot;dozens of television cameras expertly framed the ironic, silent confrontation between Goddess and chairman.&quot; When the time came for the actual unveiling, On May 30, 1989, two Beijing residents, a woman and a man, were chosen at random from the crowd and invited into the circle to pull the strings that would remove the pieces of red and blue cloth. The crowd burst into cheers and shouted slogans such as &quot;Long live democracy!&quot;

With the construction of the statue &quot;The students, their flagging spirits revived, announced their determination to continue occupying the Square.&quot; While there had been just 10,000 people in the square on the 29th, with its unveiling &quot;As many as 300,000 spectators flocked to the square on 30–31.&quot; As one historian relates, &quot;...a crudely sculpted thirty-three-foot high statue would bestow the struggle for democracy with a memorable symbol. ...it attracted thousands of spectators to the Square and angered the authorities, who condemned it as an &#x27;illegal, permanent&#x27; structure that would have to be torn down.&quot;

==Statement by its creators==
The art students who created the statue wrote a declaration that said in part:

The document was signed by the eight art academies that sponsored the creation of the statue: The Central Academies of Fine Arts, Arts and Crafts, Drama, and Music; the Beijing Film Academy; the Beijing Dance Academy; the Academy of Chinese Local Stage Arts; and the Academy of Traditional Music.

The entire statement was written &quot;in rather crude calligraphy&quot; on a long banner placed near the statue, and was read in its entirety by a female student &quot;with a good Mandarin accent&quot; from the Broadcasting Academy.

==Democracy University==

On June 3 even as the government troops positioned themselves to move on the students, applause erupted from the people gathered around the statue as it was announced there that a Democracy University would now begin classes in the Square with Zhang Boli appointed as its president. Even as classes began by the statue, to the west of the square and at Muxidi thousands of students moved to block the oncoming 27th Army who were armed with tanks, assault weapons, and bayonets. Blood was spilled by 10:30 p.m.

==Fall of the &quot;Goddess&quot;==
The soldiers were able to fulfill their timeline of reaching the Square on June 4, 1989, by 1 a.m. through the use of tanks and armored personnel carriers. The &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot; had stood for only five days before being destroyed by soldiers of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in the assault on Tiananmen that would end the Democracy Movement. The toppling of the &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot; was seen by millions across the world on television: &quot;pushed by a tank, it fell forward and to the right, so that its hands and the torch struck the ground first, breaking off.&quot; As the statue fell, protestors shouted &quot;Down with Fascism!&quot; and &quot;Bandits! Bandits!&quot; It was &quot;quickly and easily reduced to rubble, mixing with all the other rubble in the Square. To be cleared away by the Army&quot;. By 5:40 a.m. a negotiated settlement allowed the remaining students to leave by the south-eastern corner of the square. The army had fulfilled its order to clear the Square by 6:00 am. Clashes continued throughout the city and in other towns across China.

==Replicas==

The original statue has become an icon of liberty and a symbol of free speech and democracy movements. The Chinese government has tried to distance itself from any discussions about the original statue or about the Tiananmen Square protests, and in the case of the Victims of Communism Memorial it called the building of a replica an &quot;attempt to defame China&quot;.

Several replicas of the statue have been erected worldwide to commemorate the events of 1989:
*A replica erected at a vigil attended by tens of thousands of people in Victoria Park, Hong Kong on June 4, 1996. It was removed 23 December 2021.
*A bronze sculpture was begun in 1989, dedicated in 1994, by Thomas Marsh, leading a group of volunteers. Standing in Portsmouth Square, in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, it weighs approximately 600 pounds (272 kg) and bears the inscription, &quot;Dedicated to Those Who Strive For and Cherish Human Rights and Democracy.&quot;
*A copy at the University of British Columbia, erected by the school&#x27;s Alma Mater Society. This is a 2.7 metre (9&#x27;) epoxy and white marble dust mixture replica erected in 1991. In 2018, the UBC student newspaper detailed the tensions around the piece. In 2019, one of the Grad Class Gifts to the UBC Vancouver campus included &quot;$5,000 to be allocated to the revitalization of the &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot; and a Tiananmen Square 30-year recognition ceremony.&quot;
*A gilded replica stood in the foyer of the Student Centre at York University in Toronto, Ontario. It was removed in 2011 (allegedly due to its deteriorating condition) and replaced outdoors by a smaller bronze replica outside the Student Centre in June 2012.
*A replica of the San Francisco statue was erected in an outdoor museum in Freedom Park Arlington, Virginia, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the protests.
*An unknown artist&#x27;s fiberglass copy was erected at the University of Calgary in 1995, commemorating students who died in the uprisings six years earlier.
*A lantern sculpture of a figure wearing native Taiwanese dress, but standing in a two-handed torch-bearing pose recalling the &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot;, was erected in advance of the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The start of the games coincided with the twentieth anniversary of the events in China.
*Two small-scale replicas were built and set up in Hong Kong in 2010 for the Tiananmen Square protests memorial gatherings, but were confiscated by the Hong Kong Police Force after a public display at Times Square Public Space. It was subsequently returned due to serious public opinion pressure, and was displayed at the vigil on June 4, 2010, at Victoria Park. After the candle night memorial gathering, the new 3-meter (10&#x27;) bronze statue of the &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot; was moved to the Chinese University of Hong Kong campus for permanent display at its entrance of University Train Station. The erection of this bronze statue of the &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot; was not approved by the university administration but 2000 Chinese university students, staff and alum with many other Hong Kong citizen worked together after the Victoria Park gathering to guard the statue to move to Chinese University campus.
*The Democracy Award given by the National Endowment for Democracy is a small-scale replica of the &quot;Goddess of Democracy&quot;.
*A 10 ft (3-meter) bronze replica, Victims of Communism Memorial, is in Washington, D.C.
*An augmented reality version of the statue created by the artists collective 4Gentlemen, part of Tiananmen SquARed, a two part augmented reality public art project and memorial.

Tsao Tsing-yuan, an advisor to the students who built the original, writes &quot;I myself envision a day when another replica, as large as the original and more permanent, stands in Tiananmen Square, with the names of those who died there written in gold on its base. It may well stand there after the Chairman Mao&#x27;s Mausoleum has, in its turn, been pulled down.&quot;

<doc id="338849" wikidata="Q1888138" url="?curid=338849" title="The Last Starfighter">
<text>The Last Starfighter is a 1984 American space opera film directed by Nick Castle. The film tells the story of Alex Rogan (Lance Guest), a teenager who, after winning the high score in an arcade game that&#x27;s secretly a simulation test, is recruited by an alien defense force to fight in an interstellar war. It also features Dan O&#x27;Herlihy, Catherine Mary Stewart, and Robert Preston in his final role in a theatrical film. The character of Centauri, a &quot;lovable con-man&quot;, was written with him in mind and was a nod to his most famous role as Professor Harold Hill in &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962).

&quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; was released on July 13, 1984 by Universal Pictures. It received $28.7 million in the worldwide box office, against a budget of $15 million, and positive reviews from critics. The film, along with Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), has the distinction of being one of cinema&#x27;s earliest films to use extensive &quot;real-life&quot; computer-generated imagery (CGI) to depict its many starships, environments, and battle scenes. There was a subsequent novelization of the film by Alan Dean Foster, as well as a video game based on the production. In 2004, it was also adapted as an off-Broadway musical.

==Plot==

Alex Rogan is a teenager living in a trailer park with his mother and younger brother Louis, spending most of his spare time as the park&#x27;s ad hoc handyman. Aside from his girlfriend Maggie, Alex&#x27;s only diversion from his mundane existence is an arcade game called &quot;Starfighter&quot;, in which the player is &quot;recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada&quot; in a space battle. On the evening he breaks the game&#x27;s record as its highest-scoring player, Alex becomes angry and depressed on learning his bank loan for a college tuition has been rejected. 

The inventor of &quot;Starfighter&quot;, Centauri, arrives in a futuristic car with a proposition for Alex. Centauri is in fact a disguised alien and his car a spacecraft. Alex is taken to the planet Rylos while Beta, a doppelgänger android, is used to cover Alex&#x27;s absence. Alex learns there is actually a real conflict between a Star League of peaceful worlds and the oppressive Ko-Dan Empire; the latter&#x27;s armada, poised to invade Rylos, is led by Xur, a tyrannical Rylan traitor who has sabotaged the Frontier forcefield shielding Rylos and other worlds from the Ko-Dan. The last line of defense against the armada is a small fleet of Gunstar spacecraft, operated by &quot;Navigators&quot; paired with gunners called &quot;Starfighters&quot;. Centauri&#x27;s &quot;Starfighter&quot; arcade game is a recruiting tool designed to train Starfighters. Alex meets a friendly reptilian Navigator named Grig, and explains his unwillingness to take part in the coming conflict. Grig sympathizes with Alex while Centauri tries to persuade him to stay, touting him as a gifted Starfighter.

Xur contacts Starfighter Command as Alex watches. After publicly executing a Star League spy, Xur threatens Rylos with imminent invasion, and an unnerved Alex asks to be taken home. On Earth, a disappointed Centauri gives Alex a means to contact him should he change his mind. A saboteur eliminates Starfighter Command&#x27;s defenses and the Ko-Dan attack, killing the Starfighters and destroying their Gunstars. The saboteur warns Xur of Alex&#x27;s escape.

Alex discovers Beta and contacts Centauri to retrieve him. Centauri arrives just as Alex and Beta are attacked by a Zando-Zan, an alien assassin in Xur&#x27;s service. Centauri is wounded protecting Alex, and he and Beta explain that more of them will be on their way to Earth; the only way for Alex to protect himself, his family, and his planet is to embrace his ability as a Starfighter. Alex agrees, and Centauri flies Alex back to Starfighter Command before succumbing to his injury. Alex and Grig take off in a prototype Gunstar which survived the earlier attack.

While Grig mentors Alex, Beta finds it difficult to maintain his impersonation, particularly with Maggie. When another Zando-Zan shoots Beta in front of Maggie, revealing to both that Beta is an android imposter, Beta tells her the truth. They steal a pickup truck and chase the Zando-Zan back to its ship as it attempts to warn Xur. Beta has Maggie jump out before sacrificing himself by crashing the truck into the ship, destroying both and preventing the assassin&#x27;s warning from being sent.

The arrogant Xur assumes Alex has been eliminated and orders the armada to invade, but Alex and Grig ambush his command ship from behind. Ko-Dan Commander Kril orders Xur&#x27;s arrest, but Alex&#x27;s attack severely damages the command ship&#x27;s weapons and communications with its fighters, and Xur escapes in the confusion. Alex and Grig attack the Ko-Dan fighters but are outnumbered and overwhelmed. Alex desperately activates a secret weapon that quickly destroys the remaining fighters. Kril attempts to ram them, but Alex cripples the command ship further, causing it to crash into Rylos&#x27; moon.

Alex is proclaimed the savior of Rylos, and is persuaded to stay and help rebuild the Star League&#x27;s Starfighter legion by Grig, Rylan Ambassador Enduran, and a recovered Centauri. Alex and Grig briefly return to Earth, landing their Gunstar in the trailer park, where Grig tells its residents of Alex&#x27;s heroism. Alex bids his family farewell and asks Maggie to come with him, and she agrees. Inspired, Louis begins playing the &quot;Starfighter&quot; game.

==Production==
Jonathan R. Betuel stated the genesis for the film came about because he wandered into a video arcade and saw a young boy playing a video game. At that time, he was reading the book The Once and Future King by T.H. White. He wondered what would happen if a video game were a metaphorical sword in a stone, and a boy racked up an incredible score, which would cause a ripple effect across the universe. 


&quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; was shot in 38 days, mostly night shoots in Canyon Country. It was one of the earliest films to make extensive use of computer graphics for its special effects. In place of physical models, 3D rendered models were used to depict space ships and many other objects. The Gunstar and other spaceships were designed by artist Ron Cobb, who also worked on &quot;Dark Star&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;.

Computer graphics for the film were rendered by Digital Productions (DP) on a Cray X-MP supercomputer. The company created 27 minutes of effects for the film. This was considered an enormous amount of computer generated imagery at the time. For the 300 scenes containing computer graphics in the film, each frame of the animation contained an average of 250,000 polygons and had a resolution of 3000 × 5000 36-bit pixels. Digital Productions estimated that using computer animation required only half the time and between a third to half of the cost of traditional special effects. The result was a cost of $14 million for a film that made close to $29 million at the box office.

DP used Fortran, CFT77 for programming:
Not all special effects in the film were done with computer animation. The depiction of the Beta unit before it had taken Alex&#x27;s form was a practical effect, created by makeup artist Lance Anderson. The Starcar, created by Gene Winfield and driven by Centauri, was a working vehicle based on Winfield&#x27;s Spinner designs from &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

Because the test audiences responded positively to the Beta Alex character, director Nick Castle added more scenes of Beta Alex interacting with the trailer park community. Because Lance Guest had cut his hair short after initial filming had been completed and he contracted an illness during the re-shoots, his portrayal of Beta Alex in the added scenes has him wearing a wig and heavy makeup. Wil Wheaton had a few lines of dialogue that were ultimately cut from the film, but he still is visible in the background of several scenes.

==Music==

Composer Craig Safan wanted to go &quot;bigger than &quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot; and therefore utilized a &quot;Mahler-sized&quot; orchestra, resulting in an unusual breadth of instruments, including &quot;quadruple woodwinds&quot; and &quot;eight trumpets, [trombones], and horns!&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; received an approval rating of 76%, based on 90 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;While &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; is clearly derivative of other sci-fi franchises, its boundary-pushing visual effects and lovably plucky tone make for an appealing adventure&quot;. Metacritic gave the film a score of 67 based on 8 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Over time, it has developed a cult following.

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars. While the actors were good, particularly Preston and O&#x27;Herlihy, Ebert wrote &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; was &quot;not a terrifically original movie&quot; but it was nonetheless &quot;well-made&quot;. Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;apart from a mildly amusing little sub-plot with the android replica left on Earth to conceal his absence, Alex&#x27;s adventure is strictly the movie of the video game: simple as can be, and pitched at a pre-teen audience who can believe Alex and Grig blasting a hundred alien ships and escaping without a scratch.&quot; &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; described the film as &quot;a surprisingly pleasant variation on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; boom, with sharp and witty performances from two reliable character actors and some elegant gadgetry to offset the teenage mooning&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Variety&quot; described it as having &quot;a simple yet ingenious plot&quot; and added that &quot;the action is suitably fast and furious, but what makes the movie especially enjoyable are the quirky character touches given to Guest and his fellow players.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; also noted that film critic Gene Siskel described &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; as the best of all &quot;Star Wars&quot; imitators. Alan Jones awarded it three stars out of five for &quot;Radio Times&quot;, writing that it was a &quot;glossy, space-age fairy tale&quot; and &quot;highly derivative — &quot;Star Trek&quot;-like aliens have &quot;Star Wars&quot;-inspired dog-fights against a computer-graphic backdrop — but the sensitive love story between Guest and Catherine Mary Stewart cuts through the cuteness and gives the intergalactic adventures a much-needed boost.&quot;

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;″s popularity has resulted in several non-film adaptations of the storyline and uses of the name.

===Musical===
A musical adaptation was first produced at the Storm Theatre Off-Off Broadway in New York City in October 2004, with music and lyrics by Skip Kennon and book by Fred Landau. In November 2005, the original cast recording was released on the Kritzerland label.

===Books===
Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of the film shortly after it was released ().

===Comics===
The year the film was released, Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation by writer Bill Mantlo and artists Bret Blevins and Tony Salmons in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #31. The adaptation was also available as a three-issue limited series.

===Games===
In 1984, FASA, a sci-fi tabletop game maker, created &quot;The Last Starfighter: Tunnel Chase&quot; board game.

===Video games===

====Arcade====
A real &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; arcade game by Atari, Inc. is promised in the end credits, but was never released. If released, the game would have been Atari&#x27;s first 3D polygonal arcade game to use a Motorola 68000 as the CPU. Gameplay was to have been taken from game scenes and space battle scenes in the film, and used the same controller used on the first Star Wars arcade game. The game was abandoned once Atari representatives saw the film in post-production and decided it was not going to be a financial success.

==== Home ====
Home versions of the game for the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 consoles and Atari 8-bit computers were also developed, but never commercially released under the &quot;Last Starfighter&quot; name. The home computer version was eventually renamed and released (with some minor changes) as &quot;Star Raiders II&quot;. A prototype exists for the Atari 2600 &quot;Last Starfighter&quot; game, which was in actuality a game already in development by Atari under the name &quot;Universe&quot;. The game was eventually released as &quot;Solaris&quot;.

In 1990, an NES game titled &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; was released, but was actually a conversion of &quot;Uridium&quot; for Commodore 64, with modified sprites, title screen and soundtrack.

A freeware playable version of the game, based on what is seen in the film, was released for PC in 2007. This is a faithful reproduction of the arcade game from the film, featuring full sound effects and music from the game. Game creators Rogue Synapse also built a working arcade cabinet of the game.

==Potential sequel==
In February 2008, production company GPA Entertainment added &quot;&quot;Starfighter&quot; – The sequel to the classic motion picture &quot;Last Starfighter&quot; to its list of projects. But two months later, the project was reported to be &quot;stuck in the pre-production phase&quot;. It was still there . Hollywood directors including Seth Rogen and Steven Spielberg, as well as screenwriter Gary Whitta, expressed interest in creating a sequel or remake, but the potential sequel rights-holder, Jonathan R. Betuel, has allegedly indicated that he does not want another film made.

The rights to the film have not been clearly defined due to conflicting information. Multiple sources say Universal Pictures still owns the theatrical and home media distribution rights while Warner Bros., which absorbed Lorimar-Telepictures (Lorimar&#x27;s successor) in 1990, has the international distribution rights. Another source states that Universal has the option to remake the film while Betuel has sequel rights. Further complicating the situation is a claim that both Universal and Warner Bros. each have remake and sequel rights.

In July 2015, it was reported that Betuel would write a TV reboot of the film.

On April 4, 2018, Whitta posted concept art for &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; sequel on his Twitter account. In the same tweet, he also indicated that Betuel would be collaborating with him on the project. In a follow-up interview with Gizmodo, Whitta referred to the project as &quot;a combination of reboot and sequel that we both think honors the legacy of the original film while passing the torch to a new generation.&quot;

On October 20, 2020, Betuel stated that, with Whitta, a script for a sequel was being written and the rights to the film had been recaptured.

On March 25, 2021, Whitta posted a sequel concept reel on YouTube called &quot;The Last Starfighters&quot; with concept art by Matt Allsopp and music by Chris Tilton and Craig Safan, featuring an audio clip from the original movie by Robert Preston.

<doc id="338851" wikidata="Q311931" url="?curid=338851" title="Bedřich Hrozný">
<text>Bedřich Hrozný (; 6 May 1879 – 12 December 1952), also known as , was a Czech orientalist and linguist. He contributed to the decipherment of the ancient Hittite language, identified it as an Indo-European language, and laid the groundwork for the development of Hittitology.

==Biography==

Hrozný was born in Lysá nad Labem, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary. In the town of Kolín he learned Hebrew and Arabic. At the University of Vienna, he studied Akkadian, Aramaic, Ethiopian, Sumerian and Sanskrit, as well as the cuneiform used in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia and Persia. He also studied orientalism at Humboldt University of Berlin.

==Career==
In 1905, following excavations in Palestine, he became professor at the University of Vienna.

In 1906, at Hattusa (modern Boğazkale, about 200 km east of Ankara) a German expedition found the archives of the Hittite kings in cuneiform, but in an unknown language. While on active duty in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I, Hrozný published in 1917 a description of the language showing that it belonged to the Indo-European family.

In 1925 Hrozný led a Czechoslovak archaeological team that discovered 1000 cuneiform tablets containing contracts and letters of Assyrian merchants in the Turkish village of Kültepe, and excavated the nearby ancient Hittite city of Kanesh.

In 1929, Hrozný founded &quot;Archiv Orientální&quot;, which became one of the leading journals for Oriental Studies. 

Later in his life, he tried to decipher the hieroglyphic script used by the Hittites and scripts used in ancient India and Crete, but failed in his effort. From 1919 to 1952, he was a Professor of cuneiform research and ancient Oriental history at the Charles University in Prague. After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia he was made rector of the Charles University, holding that post in 19391940 (all Czech universities were closed by Germans then). In that capacity, he helped some students escape arrest during an incident in 1939, stating to the German officer in charge that the Germans had no legal right to pursue students on the independent university&#x27;s territory. A stroke in 1944 ended his scientific work.

==Deciphering of the Hittite language ==

To solve the mystery of the Hittite language, Bedřich Hrozný focused on a text passage that reads: nu NINDA-an ezzatteni watar-ma ekutteni. It was known at that time that the ideogram for NINDA meant bread in Sumerian. Hrozný thought that the suffix &quot;-an&quot; might be the Hittite accusative singular ending. Then, he assumed that the second word, &quot;ed-/ezza-&quot;, had something to do with the bread and thought that it could be the verb &quot;eat&quot;. The comparison with Latin &quot;edo&quot;, English &quot;eat&quot;, and German &quot;essen&quot; led him to infer that NINDA-an ezzatteni means &quot;you (will) eat bread&quot;. In the second sentence, Hrozný was struck by the word &quot;watar&quot;, which recalled English &quot;water&quot; and German &quot;Wasser&quot;. The last word of the second sentence, &quot;ekutteni&quot;, had the stem &quot;eku-&quot;, which seemed to resemble the Latin &quot;aqua&quot; (water). He thus translated the second sentence as &quot;you (will) drink water&quot;. Hrozný soon realized that the Hittites were speaking an Indo-European language, which greatly facilitated the decipherment and interpretation of Hittite cuneiform texts. Building upon these insights, he continued his work and was able to publish a preliminary Hittite grammar already in 1917.

<doc id="338861" wikidata="Q272811" url="?curid=338861" title="Carolyn Gold Heilbrun">
<text>Carolyn Heilbrun ( Gold; January 13, 1926 – October 9, 2003) was an American academic at Columbia University, the first woman to receive tenure in the English department, and a prolific feminist author of academic studies. In addition, beginning in the 1960s, she published numerous popular mystery novels with a woman protagonist, under the pen name of Amanda Cross. These have been translated into numerous languages and in total sold nearly one million copies worldwide.

==Early life and education==
Heilbrun was born in East Orange, New Jersey, to Archibald Gold and Estelle (Roemer) Gold. The family moved to Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side when she was a child. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1947 with a major in English. Afterward, she studied English literature at Columbia University, receiving her M.A. in 1951 and Ph.D. in 1959. Among her most important mentors were Columbia professors Jacques Barzun and Lionel Trilling, while Clifton Fadiman was an important inspiration: She wrote about these three in her final non-fiction work, &quot;When Men Were the Only Models We Had: My Teachers Barzun, Fadiman, Trilling&quot; (2002).

== Career ==
Heilbrun taught English at Columbia for more than three decades, from 1960 to 1992. She was the first woman to receive tenure in the English Department and held an endowed position. Her academic specialty was British modern literature, with a particular interest in the Bloomsbury Group. Her academic books include the feminist study &quot;Writing a Woman&#x27;s Life&quot; (1988). In 1983, she co-founded and became co-editor of the Columbia University Press&#x27;s Gender and Culture Series with literary scholar Nancy K. Miller. From 1985 until her retirement in 1992, she was Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at Columbia.

===Kate Fansler mystery novels===
Heilbrun was the author of 15 Kate Fansler mysteries, published under the pen name of Amanda Cross. Her protagonist Kate Fansler, like Heilbrun, was an English professor. In 1965, the first novel in the series was shortlisted for the Edgar Award in the category of Best First novel.

Heilbrun kept her second career as a mystery novelist secret in order to protect her academic career, until a fan discovered the true identity of &quot;Amanda Cross&quot; through copyright records. Through her novels, all set in academia, Heilbrun explored issues in feminism, academic politics, women&#x27;s friendships, and other social and political themes. &quot;Death in a Tenured Position&quot; (1981, set at Harvard University) was particularly harsh in its criticism of the academic establishment&#x27;s treatment of women. Heilbrun, according to Kimberly Maslin, &quot;reconceptualizes the role of the detective and the nature of crime and its resolution.&quot; Her books were translated into &quot;Japanese, German, French, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish and Italian, selling in total nearly a million copies worldwide.&quot;

==Personal life==
She married James Heilbrun, whom she met in college. He was an economist, and they had three children.

== Later life and death ==
Heilbrun enjoyed solitude when working and, despite being a wife and mother of three, often spent time alone at various retreats over the years, including her luxury Manhattan apartment and a country home in upstate New York. She also had a Summer house in Alford, Massachusetts. At the age of 68, she purchased a new home to use by herself, as she wanted a private place. She held strong opinions on nearly every aspect of women&#x27;s lives and also believed that ending one&#x27;s own life was a basic human right. In keeping with her views on aging in &quot;The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty&quot;, she quit wearing high heels, hose, and form-fitting clothing in her early 60s. She adopted blouses and slacks as her daily attire. Heilbrun&#x27;s son recalled, &quot;My mother was a generous hostess when she was young, but lost interest in dinner parties as she got older. She preferred to order groceries from the local supermarket and have them sent to her apartment as she was too busy to waste time squeezing oranges at Fairway.&quot;

In the book &quot;The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty&quot;, Heilbrun expressed her desire to take her own life on her 70th birthday because &quot;there is no joy in life past that point, only to experience the miserable endgame.&quot; She turned 70 in January 1996 and did not follow up on her idea at the time. She lived another seven years.

One fall morning in 2003, she went for a walk around New York City with her longtime friend Mary Ann Caws and told the latter: &quot;I feel sad.&quot; When Caws prompted her why, Heilbrun responded, &quot;The universe.&quot; Afterward, she went home to her apartment. The next morning she was found dead, having taken sleeping pills and placed a plastic bag over her head. She left a suicide note, which read: &quot;The journey is over. Love to all.&quot; She was 77 years old. According to her son, she had been in good health with no known physical or mental ailments, and she felt her life was &quot;completed&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Heilbrun received the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966 and 1970, a Bunting Institute Fellowship in 1976, and a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1976.
She was a National Endowment for the Humanities Senior Research Fellow in 1983. Heilbrun served as a member of the executive council of the Modern Language Association from 1976 to 1979, and was the president in 1984.

==Controversies==
Heilbrun was the subject of a 1992 &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; profile by Anne Matthews wherein she accused the Columbia English Department of discriminating against women. Former Dean of Columbia College Carl Hovde admitted that there was widespread past discrimination against women at Columbia &quot;and all other universities,&quot; but dismissed Matthews&#x27;s accusations of current discriminations in an angry letter to the editor as &quot;rubbish.&quot; Nonetheless, Heilbrun was very specific in her memories of being a celebrated female professor at Columbia. &quot;When I spoke up for women&#x27;s issues, I was made to feel unwelcome in my own department, kept off crucial committees, ridiculed, ignored,&quot; Heilbrun told &quot;the New York Times&quot;. &quot;Ironically, my name in the catalogue gave Columbia a reputation for encouraging feminist studies in modernism. Nothing could be further from the truth.&quot;

==Bibliography==

<text>The vocal tract is the cavity in human bodies and in animals where the sound produced at the sound source (larynx in mammals; syrinx in birds) is filtered.

In birds, it consists of the trachea, the syrinx, the oral cavity, the upper part of the esophagus, and the beak. In mammals, it consists of the laryngeal cavity, the pharynx, the oral cavity, and the nasal cavity.

The estimated average length of the vocal tract in men is 16.9 cm and 14.1 cm in women.

<doc id="338869" wikidata="Q223163" url="?curid=338869" title="The Emperor's New Groove">
<text>The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove is a 2000 American animated fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Mark Dindal and produced by Randy Fullmer, from a screenplay written by David Reynolds, and based on a story conceived by Dindal and Chris Williams. The voice cast features David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton, and Wendie Malick. Inspired by ancient Peruvian culture and set in an Incan empire, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; follows selfish young Emperor Kuzco (voiced by Spade), who is accidentally transformed into a llama by his treacherous ex-advisor, Yzma (Kitt), and her dimwitted henchman Kronk (Warburton). For the emperor to change back into a human, he entrusts a village leader, Pacha (Goodman), to escort him back to the palace before Yzma can track them down and finish him off.

Development of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; began in 1994 when the film was conceived as a musical epic titled &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;. Following his directorial debut with &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), Roger Allers recruited English musician Sting to compose several songs for the film. Because of the underwhelming box-office performances of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996), Dindal was brought in as co-director to make the film more comedic. Because of poor test screenings, creative differences with Dindal, and production falling behind schedule, Allers departed, and the film became a lighthearted comedy in the vein of a Chuck Jones cartoon instead of a dramatic musical. A documentary, &quot;The Sweatbox&quot; (2002), details the production troubles that &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; endured during its six years of development.

&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on December 10, 2000, and was released in theaters on December 15, 2000. It received generally positive reviews from critics, but underperformed at the box office compared to Disney films released in the 1990s, grossing $169.5 million on a $100-million budget. However, the film found larger success when it was released for home media, and became the best-selling home video release of 2001. In the years since its release, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; has garnered a cult following among fans. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song &quot;My Funny Friend and Me&quot;, performed by Sting; that award went to &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; by Bob Dylan from &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;. A direct-to-video spin-off sequel, &quot;Kronk&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, was released in 2005, and an animated television series, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New School&quot;, aired on the Disney Channel from 2006 to 2008.

==Plot==

In South America, Incan emperor Kuzco has been spoiled his entire life, and has become incredibly conceited. On the day before his 18th birthday, Kuzco announces his plan to demolish a nearby village and have a lavish summer home constructed in its place, despite the objections of its leader Pacha. Kuzco also discovers his elderly advisor and alchemist Yzma usurping his duties and summarily fires her. Yzma and her bumbling henchman Kronk plot to poison Kuzco&#x27;s wine and take over the empire before the news of Yzma&#x27;s termination becomes public. However, Kronk takes the wrong chemical vial from Yzma&#x27;s laboratory, accidentally turning Kuzco into a llama. Yzma orders Kronk to knock Kuzco out, take him outside the city, and kill him. An attack of conscience and a series of mishaps causes Kronk to drop the sack containing the unconscious Kuzco; the sack lands on the back of Pacha&#x27;s cart, and Pacha leaves the city before Kronk can catch up to him. Kuzco awakens in Pacha&#x27;s backyard, having lost some of his memory. Believing Pacha transformed and kidnapped him, Kuzco orders Pacha to take him home. Pacha refuses to help unless Kuzco changes his mind and builds his summer home elsewhere.

Kuzco arrogantly rejects Pacha&#x27;s demand and ventures into the jungle alone, despite Pacha&#x27;s warnings. Kuzco is pursued by jaguars, but Pacha saves him. Kuzco begrudgingly agrees to relocate the construction site of his summer home if Pacha takes him home. On the way to the palace, Kuzco tries to renege on his promise; he and Pacha fight on a collapsing bridge, before being forced to work together to escape some crocodiles and a crumbling cliff face. Meanwhile, Yzma discovers Kronk lost Kuzco and the duo set out to find him. At a roadside diner, Pacha and Kuzco arrive at the same time as Yzma and Kronk, but neither party initially notices the other. However, Kronk nearly recognizes Pacha, who overhears Yzma&#x27;s plans to murder Kuzco. He sneaks Kuzco out of the diner, but Kuzco does not believe Pacha&#x27;s warnings. Kuzco and Pacha fight again and part ways. Kuzco almost approaches Yzma and Kronk, but overhears them discussing their plans to kill him; they also remark that Kuzco&#x27;s subjects were not grieved by his apparent death. His self-delusions shattered by Yzma&#x27;s true colors, Kuzco flees into the jungle to apologize to Pacha, but cannot find him.

The next morning, Kuzco glumly resigns himself to living like a llama but finds Pacha and the duo reconcile. Meanwhile, Kronk remembers where he saw Pacha before and tells Yzma. Kuzco and Pacha return to Pacha&#x27;s village, only to discover that Yzma and Kronk are in Pacha&#x27;s house, posing as distant relatives. Pacha&#x27;s family distracts Yzma to give Pacha and Kuzco a head start; however, Yzma and Kronk still manage to confront the duo in Yzma&#x27;s lab. Against Yzma&#x27;s orders of dispatching the duo, Kronk has another attack of conscience and Yzma repeatedly insults him and he tries to kill her instead. Yzma drops Kronk through a trapdoor. As Pacha and Kuzco flee from Yzma and her guards, Kuzco tries several different potions, without success. After figuring out which vial is the &quot;human&quot; potion, Kuzco, Pacha and Yzma fight over it; Yzma is turned into a cat by one of the other potions, and Pacha nearly falls off the side of the palace; this forces Kuzco to rescue Pacha, allowing Yzma to take the vial. With some teamwork and inadvertent assistance from Kronk, the duo defeat Yzma and recover the vial. After becoming human again, Kuzco makes amends with the people he hurt and builds a much smaller summer home on an uninhabited hill near Pacha&#x27;s village. Meanwhile, Kronk goes on to become the leader of a scout troop, with Yzma, still as a cat, being a reluctant member of it.

==Production==
===&quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;===

Following the theatrical release of &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), Roger Allers was called into Thomas Schumacher&#x27;s office to discuss his next project. Inside his office, Schumacher explained that Disney Feature Animation was interested in exploring ancient cultures for prospective film projects. He held three pictures representative of the Inca, Aztec, and Mayan cultures. Allers chose the Inca culture as he became intrigued with the visual possibilities of the Inca creation myth. Allers would base his story on Anthony Hope&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.

Alongside co-writer Matthew Jacobs, Allers formulated the idea for &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;, in which development on the project began in 1994. Upon pitching the project to then-Disney CEO and chairman Michael Eisner, Allers recalled Eisner saying &quot;It has all of the elements of a classic Disney film,&quot; and because of his directorial success on &quot;The Lion King&quot; that same year, Eisner allowed Allers to have free rein with both the casting and the storyline. In January 1995, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Allers was working on &quot;an Inca-themed original story&quot;. In 1996, the production crew traveled to Machu Picchu in Peru, to study Inca artifacts and architecture, and the landscape this empire was created in.

&quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; was to have been a tale of a greedy, selfish emperor (voiced by David Spade) who finds a peasant (voiced by Owen Wilson) who looks just like him; the emperor swaps places with the peasant to escape his boring life and have fun, much as in author Mark Twain&#x27;s archetypal novel &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;. However, the villainous witch Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt) has plans to summon Supay (the evil god of death), and destroy the sun so that she may become young and beautiful forever (the sun gives her wrinkles, so she surmises that living in a world of darkness would prevent her from aging). Discovering the switch between the prince and the peasant, Yzma turns the real emperor into a llama and threatens to reveal the pauper&#x27;s identity unless he obeys her. During his time as the emperor and doing Yzma&#x27;s orders, the pauper falls in love with the emperor&#x27;s soon-to-be fiancée Nina who thinks he is the emperor who has changed his ways. Meanwhile, the emperor-llama learns humility in his new form and even comes to love a female llama-herder named Mata (voiced by Laura Prepon). Together, the girl and the llama set out to undo the witch&#x27;s plans. The book &quot;Reel Views 2&quot; says the film would have been a &quot;romantic comedy musical in the &#x27;traditional&#x27; Disney style&quot;.

Following the underwhelming box office performances of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, studio executives felt that the project was growing too ambitious and serious for audiences following test screenings, and needed more comedy. In early 1997, producer Randy Fullmer contacted and offered Mark Dindal, who had just wrapped up work on Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, to be co-director on &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;. Meanwhile, Allers personally called Sting, in the wake of Elton John&#x27;s success with &quot;The Lion King&quot; soundtrack, to compose several songs for the film. He agreed, but on the condition that his filmmaker wife Trudie Styler could &quot;document the process of the production&quot;. This film, which was eventually entitled &quot;The Sweatbox&quot;, was made by Xingu Films (their production company). Along with collaborator David Hartley, Sting composed eight songs inextricably linked with the original plot and characters.

In the summer of 1997, it was announced that Allers and Dindal would serve as the film&#x27;s directors and Randy Fullmer as producer. Spade and Kitt had been confirmed to voice the emperor Manco and the villainess, while Carla Gugino was in talks for the role of Nina. Harvey Fierstein was also cast as Huaca, a 10,000-year-old rock who kept a sharp eye on the emperors who ruled before Manco.

In the summer of 1998, it became apparent that &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; was not far along enough in production to be released in the summer of 2000 as planned. At this time, one of the Disney executives reportedly walked into Fullmer&#x27;s office and, placing his thumb and index finger a quarter-inch apart, angrily stated &quot;Your film is this close to being shut down.&quot; Fullmer approached Allers and informed him of the need to finish the film on time for its summer 2000 release as crucial promotional deals with McDonald&#x27;s, Coca-Cola, and other companies were already established and depended upon meeting that release date. From screenings, Allers&#x27; vision of the film was recognized as having far too many elements. Schumacher and Peter Schneider spoke to Allers and Dindal to try to work out a pared-down film, but the two had different ideas for which direction to take the film. Schumacher and Schneider broke the staff into two small teams under Allers and Dindal and effectively had them run a &quot;bake-off&quot; to decide which version to go. While Allers altered some of the details of the original pitch, Dindal proposed a complete tonal shift into a comedy that Schumacher and Schneider responded favorably to. Allers allowed Dindal&#x27;s version of the film to go forward and opted to step down from co-director. With this change in direction, on September 23, 1998, the project became dormant with production costs amounting to $25–30 million and twenty-five percent of the film animated.

===Production overhaul and changes===
Upset that Allers left the project, Eisner gave Fullmer two weeks to salvage the project or production would be completely shut down. In December 1998, Fullmer and Dindal halted production for six months to retool the project, renaming it from &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; to &quot;Kingdom in the Sun&quot;, thus making it the first Disney animated feature to have an extensive overhaul since &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Meanwhile, following Eric Goldberg&#x27;s pitch for the &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; segment for &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, the animators were reassigned to work on the segment.

Story work on the revised film started when they knew what to retain from the original version, namely David Spade as Manco and Eartha Kitt as Yzma, with the remaining elements to be written around those characters. Chris Williams, who was a storyboard artist during &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;, came up with the idea of making Pacha an older character as opposed to the teenager that he was in the original version, as to be the opposite of Manco. Following up on the new idea, former late-night comedy writer David Reynolds stated, &quot;I pitched a simple comedy that&#x27;s basically a buddy road picture with two guys being chased in the style of a Chuck Jones &#x27;toon, but faster paced. Disney said, &#x27;Give it a shot.″&quot; One of the new additions to the revised story was the scene-stealing character of Yzma&#x27;s sidekick Kronk. Kronk was inspired by actor Rick Rossovich, according to Williams, and as they wrote for him, Reynolds immediately thought of casting Patrick Warburton for the role based on his character Puddy from &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Meanwhile, the name Manco was changed to Kuzco following Fullmer&#x27;s discovery of the Japanese slang term &quot;manko&quot;, which translates to cunt. Due in part to the production shutdown, Sting began to develop schedule conflicts with his songwriting duties interfering with his work on the next album he was planning to record in Italy. &quot;I write the music, and then they&#x27;re supposed to animate it, but there are constantly changes being made. It&#x27;s constantly in turnaround,&quot; the singer-songwriter admitted, but &quot;I&#x27;m enjoying it.&quot; Because of the shutdown, the animated film &quot;Dinosaur&quot; assumed the summer 2000 release date originally scheduled for &quot;Kingdom&quot;.

Andreas Deja declined to return to the film after observing his more serious version of Yzma was incompatible with the new comedic tone of the film, and moved to Orlando, Florida to work on &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. Animator Dale Baer would replace Deja as the supervising animator for Yzma. Fullmer would inform Sting by telephone that his songs, related to specific scenes and characters that were now gone, had to be dropped. Bitter about the removal of his songs, the pop musician commented &quot;At first, I was angry and perturbed. Then I wanted some vengeance.&quot; Disney eventually agreed to allow three of the six deleted songs as bonus tracks on the soundtrack album, such as Yzma&#x27;s villain song &quot;Snuff Out the Light&quot;, the love song &quot;One Day She&#x27;ll Love Me&quot; and the dance number &quot;Walk the Llama, Llama&quot;. The plot elements, such as the romance between the llama herder Pacha and Manco&#x27;s betrothed Nina, the sun-capturing villain scheme, similarities to &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; story, and Inca mythology were dropped. The character of Huaca was also dropped, though he would make a cameo appearance as the candle holder during the dinner scene in the finished film. Kuzco—who was a supporting character in the original story—became the protagonist.

In the summer of 1999, cast members Owen Wilson, Harvey Fierstein, and Trudie Styler were dropped from the film. Kitt and Spade remained in the cast, Dindal commented, &quot;[a]nd then John Goodman and Patrick Warburton came aboard.&quot; After Sting&#x27;s songs for &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; were dropped from the new storyline, Sting remained on the project, though he was told by the studio that &quot;[a]ll we want is a beginning and an end song.&quot; The song, &quot;Perfect World&quot;, was approached &quot;to open the movie with a big, fun number that established the power of Kuzco and showed how he controlled the world&quot;, according to then-Feature Animation president Thomas Schumacher. The filmmakers had asked Sting to perform the song for the film, though Sting declined by telling them that he was too old to sing it and that they should find someone younger and hipper. They instead went with Tom Jones, who is eleven years older than Sting.

In February 2000, the new film was announced as &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; with its new story centering on a spoiled Inca Emperor—voiced by Spade—who through various twists and falls ends up learning the true meaning of friendship and happiness from a poor peasant voiced by Goodman. The release date was shifted to December 2000. Despite the phrasing of the title, the film is not related to Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s classic Danish fairy tale &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; (although both stories involve an emperor being tricked). However, according to Mark V. Moorhead of the &quot;Houston Press&quot;, the film&#x27;s plot does bear some resemblance to that of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Lucius Apuleius, wherein a man is turned into a donkey.

Eisner worried that the new story was too close in tone to &quot;Hercules&quot;, which had performed decently yet below expectations at the American box office. Dindal and Fullmer assured him that &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, as the film was now called, would have a much smaller cast, making it easier to attract audiences. Towards the end of production, the film&#x27;s ending originally had Kuzco building his Kuzcotopia amusement park on another hill by destroying a rainforest near Pacha&#x27;s home and inviting the former and his family to visit. Horrified at the ending, Sting commented &quot;I wrote them a letter and said, &#x27;You do this, I&#x27;m resigning because this is exactly the opposite of what I stand for. I&#x27;ve spent 20 years trying to defend the rights of indigenous people and you&#x27;re just marching over them to build a theme park. I will not be party to this.&#x27;&quot; As a result, the ending was rewritten in which Kuzco instead constructs a shack similar to Pacha&#x27;s and spends his vacation among the villagers.

===Design and animation===
During the production of &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;, Deja was the initial supervising animator of Yzma and incorporated supermodel poses published in magazines to capture Yzma&#x27;s sultry, seductive persona. Nik Ranieri was originally slated as the supervising animator for Yzma&#x27;s rocky sidekick, Hucua. During the research trip to Peru in 1996, Ranieri acknowledged that he &quot;was researching for a character that looked like a rock so I was stuck drawing rocks for the whole trip. Then when we got back they piled it into this story about ancient Incas.&quot; Mark Pudleiner was to be the supervising animator of Kuzco&#x27;s proposed maiden, Nina. In early 1997, David Pruiksma came on board to animate the llama, Snowball. According to Pruiksma, Snowball was &quot;a silly, vain and egotistical character, rather the dumb blond of the llama set. I really enjoyed developing the character and doing some early test animation on her as well. Before I left the film (and it was ultimately shelved), I created model sheets for not only Snowball, but for the rest of the herd of seven other llamas and for Kuzco as a Llama.&quot; When the film was placed on production shutdown, Pruiksma transferred to work on &quot;&quot; being developed concurrently and ultimately the llama characters were dropped from the storyline.

Following the production overhaul and the studio&#x27;s attempts for more cost-efficient animated features, Dindal urged for &quot;a simpler approach that emphasized the characters rather than overwhelming special effects or cinematic techniques&quot;. Because of the subsequent departure of Deja, animator Dale L. Baer inherited the character of Yzma. Using Kitt&#x27;s gestures during recording sessions, Baer commented &quot;She has a natural voice for animation and really got into the role. She would gesture wildly and it was fun just to watch her. She would come into each session almost serious and very professional and suddenly she would go wild and break up laughing.&quot; Ranieri was later asked to serve as the supervising animator of Kuzco (as a human and a llama), though he would admit being reluctant at first until he discovered that Kuzco &quot;had a side to him, there was a lot of comedy potential and as a character he went through an arc&quot;. Pudleiner was also reassigned to work as an animator of the human version of Kuzco. In addition to drawing inspiration from Spade during recording sessions, the Kuzco animation team studied llamas at the zoo, visited a llama farm, watched nature documentaries, and even observed the animals up close when they came for a visit to the studio. For the rewritten version of Pacha, animator Bruce W. Smith observed that &quot;Pacha is probably the most human of all the characters,&quot; and further added that he &quot;has more human mannerisms and realistic traits, which serve as a contrast to the cartoony llama he hangs out with. He is the earthy guy who brings everything back into focus. Being a big fellow about six-foot-five and weighing about 250 pounds we had to work hard to give him a sense of weight and believability in his movement.&quot;

Actual animation began in May 1999, involving 400 artists, 300 technicians, and production personnel. Outside of the Walt Disney Feature Animation studio building in Burbank, California, animators located at Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida and Walt Disney Feature Animation Paris assisted in the production of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;. During the last eighteen months of production, a 120-crew of clean-up artists would take the character animators&#x27; drawings and place a new piece of paper over the existing drawing to draw a cleaner, more refined image. &quot;We&#x27;re basically the final designers&quot;, said clean-up supervisor Vera Pacheco, whose crew worked on more than 200,000 drawings for the film. The motion reference material for the film was extensive, and included live-action footage of the actors, including Gustavo Rodríguez (born in 1981 in Caracas, Venezuela), Delia Reátegui (born 1963), Alonso Cano (born 1989) and Gabriela Villalobos (born 1988) as Kuzco, Chicha and Chicha&#x27;s slim children Tipo and Chaca, respectively, performing the scenes.

==Release==
After the release date had shifted to December 15, 2000, similarities were noted between the film and DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot;. Jeffrey Katzenberg had been at Disney while production began on &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;, but then left and started DreamWorks in 1994, and there is some speculation that &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; was based on what Katzenberg had seen at Disney. Marc Lument, a visual development artist in &quot;El Dorado&quot;, claimed &quot;It really was a race, and Katzenberg wanted ours out before theirs.&quot; Lument also added &quot;We didn&#x27;t know exactly what they were doing, but we had the impression it was going to be very similar. Whoever came out second would face the impression that they copied the other.&quot; Fullmer and Dindal denied the similarities with the latter commenting &quot;This version [&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;] was well in the works when that movie came out,&quot; and further added, &quot;Early on, when our movie got to be very comic, all of us felt that you can&#x27;t be making this farce about a specific group of people unless we are going to poke fun at ourselves. This didn&#x27;t seem to be a proper choice about Incas or any group of people. It was more of a fable.&quot;

The marketing campaign for &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; was relatively restrained as Disney opted to heavily promote the release of &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot;, which was released during Thanksgiving. Nevertheless, the film was accompanied by six launcher toys of Kuzco, Kuzco as a llama, Pacha, Yzma, Yzma as a cat, and Kronk, accompanied by Happy Meals at McDonald&#x27;s in North America. McDonald&#x27;s also released toys for the film in Europe, Asia, and Australia.

The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on December 10, 2000, with Sting in attendance.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and DVD on May 2, 2001, and September 30, 2003, as well as a &quot;2-Disc Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; that included bonus features such as Sting&#x27;s music video of &quot;My Funny Friend and Me&quot;, a Rascal Flatts music video of &quot;Walk the Llama, Llama&quot; from the soundtrack, audio commentary with the filmmakers, a multi-skill-level set-top game with the voice cast, and deleted scenes among other features. This THX-certified DVD release also contained a DTS 5.1 audio track and DVD-ROM. Unlike its theatrical box office performance, the film performed better on home video, becoming the top-selling home video release of 2001. In September 2001, it was reported that six million VHS units were sold amounting to $89 million in revenue. On DVD, it was also reported it had sold twice as many sales. The overall revenue averaged toward $125 million according to Adams Media Research. It was re-released on VHS on February 26, 2003.

Disney re-released a single-disc special edition called &quot;The New Groove Edition&quot; on October 19, 2005. Disney then digitally remastered and released &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; on Blu-ray on June 12, 2013, bundled in a two-movie collection combo pack with its sequel &quot;Kronk&#x27;s New Groove&quot;. On its first weekend, it sold 14,000 Blu-ray units grossing $282,000.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Despite making back its budget, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; was considered a box office disappointment, grossing considerably less than any of Disney&#x27;s animated films from the 1990s. The film grossed roughly $10 million on its opening weekend, opening in fourth place behind &quot;What Women Want&quot;, &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot;, and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;. It also competed with Disney&#x27;s own &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot;, which had been released just three weeks prior. The film ultimately made $89.3 million in the United States and an additional $80 million worldwide for a total of $169.6 million— the lowest box office earnings for an animated Disney feature since the 1980s. In January 2021, the movie was re-released in theaters and earned an additional $334,000.

Because of its pre-Columbian setting and Latin American flavor, Disney spent $250,000 in its marketing campaign towards the Latino market releasing dual English- and Spanish-language theatrical prints in 16 multiplexes across heavily populated Latino areas in Los Angeles, California in contrast to releasing dubbed or subtitled theatrical prints of their previous animated features in foreign markets. By January 2001, 19 days into its theatrical general release, the Spanish-dubbed prints were pulled from multiplexes as Hispanic Americans opted to watch the English-language prints with its grossing averaging $571,000 in comparison to $96,000 for the former.

===Critical response===
The film received generally positive reviews from critics release. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; holds approval rating based on reviews and an average of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; isn&#x27;t the most ambitious animated film, but its brisk pace, fresh characters, and big laughs make for a great time for the whole family.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 70 out of 100 based on 28 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Robert Koehler commented the film &quot;may not match the groovy business of many of the studio&#x27;s other kidpix, but it will be remembered as the film that established a new attitude in the halls of Disney&#x27;s animation unit&quot;. Roger Ebert, writing his review for &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, awarded the film 3 (out of 4) stars distinguishing the film as &quot;a goofy slapstick cartoon, with the attention span of Donald Duck that is separate from what&#x27;s known as animated features&quot;. Ebert would later add that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t have the technical polish of a film like &quot;Tarzan&quot;, but is a reminder that the classic cartoon look is a beloved style of its own.&quot; Emma Cochrane of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film a three out of five stars, writing, &quot;An attractive, generally enjoyable concoction, but never really hits its comedic or emotional targets full on. Fun but quickly forgettable.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film a B+, describing it as a &quot;hip, funny, mostly nonmusical, decidedly non-epic family picture, which turns out to be less of a hero&#x27;s journey than a meeting of sitcom minds&quot;.

The film was not without its detractors. Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the film 2 stars out of 5, noting that the film &quot;suffers from a persistent case of narrative backsliding that only serves to make older members of the audience long for the days of the dwarves, beauties, and poisoned apples of Disney-yore, and younger ones squirm in their seats&quot;. Savlov also unfavorably compared the film&#x27;s animation to that of &quot;Tarzan&quot;″s, writing it &quot;is also a minor letdown, with none of the ecstatic visual tour de force.&quot; Bob Strauss, in his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, acknowledged that the film is &quot;funny, frantic and colorful enough to keep the small fry diverted for its short but strained 78 minutes&quot;, though except for &quot;some nice voice work, a few impressive scale gags, and interesting, Inca-inspired design elements, there is very little here for the rest of the family to latch onto&quot;. Strauss blamed the film&#x27;s story overhaul during production as the main problem.

===Accolades===
In 2018, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; was named the 16th-best Disney animated film by &quot;IGN&quot;, and the 27th by Rotten Tomatoes in November 2022. In 2022, it did not appear in lists of the best Disney movies, between 35 chosen by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and 50 selected by &quot;Time Out&quot;.

==&quot;The Sweatbox&quot;==

&quot;The Sweatbox&quot; is a documentary that chronicled the tumultuous collaboration of Sting and David Hartley with the Disney studios to compose six songs for &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; (the film&#x27;s working title). The documentary featured interviews from directors Roger Allers and Mark Dindal, producer Randy Fullmer, Sting (whose wife Trudie Styler created the documentary), Disney story artists, and the voice cast being dismayed by the new direction. Disney was not believed to be opposed to Styler&#x27;s documentary, with Disney animation executive Thomas Schumacher, who had seen footage, commenting &quot;I think it&#x27;s going to be great!&quot;

The film premiered at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival but has gone virtually unseen by the public ever since. Disney owns the rights but has never officially released it. In March 2012, a workprint of the documentary was leaked online and was uploaded onto YouTube by a United Kingdom cartoonist before it was ultimately pulled. As of April 2015, some scenes from the documentary could be seen from the home media release, including the behind-the-scenes and the making of &quot;My Funny Friend and Me&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; was not as well received as Disney&#x27;s other animated features at the time, which were more focused on Broadway-style musicals like &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or heroic characters with comedy situations like &quot;Hercules&quot;, and arrived just before films like &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Ice Age&quot; that would launch a wave of animated comedy films. Reception towards the film has improved over time, with &quot;Polygon&quot;&#x27;s Petrana Radulovic theorizing that the film&#x27;s irreverent style of comedy had simply been released at the wrong time by debuting too soon after the tonal shift away from the musical animated films that had defined the 1990s, and too early for the humor that would become trademarks of films such as &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Ice Age&quot;. The film, as well as &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot;, have since gained appreciation as standalone works from that period as well-written comedies in part due to the arrival of Internet culture and has since become something of a cult favorite among Disney fans at the time. For &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, the film has comedic timing and slapstick comedy that has been compared to classic &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;. As a result, numerous Internet memes based on screenshots from the film have emerged, such as Pacha&#x27;s &quot;just right&quot; gesture as an image macro representing perfection or, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a meme featuring Kronk documenting &quot;Apocalypse Bingo&quot;.

==Franchise==

DisneyToon Studios produced a direct-to-video sequel titled &quot;Kronk&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, which was released on December 13, 2005, followed by an animated television series on Disney Channel titled &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New School&quot;. Patrick Warburton, Eartha Kitt, and Wendie Malick reprised their roles for the sequel and series while J. P. Manoux replaced David Spade for the series and Fred Tatasciore voiced Pacha in season 1. John Goodman subsequently reprised his role for the second and final season of the series.

Kuzco appears as a recurring guest in the animated television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and its direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot;, with Pacha, Yzma, and the Royal Recordkeeper also having minor guest appearances in the show.

Two video games were developed and released concurrently with the film. The first, for the Sony PlayStation, was developed by Argonaut Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment of America. The second, for the Nintendo Game Boy Color, was developed by Sandbox and published by Ubisoft. Both titles were released in PAL territories the following year. The PlayStation version was re-released for the North American PlayStation Network on July 27, 2010. Additionally, Kuzco, Pacha, Yzma, and Kronk appear as playable characters in the world-builder video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, as well as attractions based on Mudka&#x27;s Meat Hut and Yzma&#x27;s Lair.

The Tokyo DisneySea rollercoaster attraction Raging Spirits took visual inspiration for its Inca ruins theme from the buildings in the film with a structure based on Kuzco&#x27;s palace similarly crowning the ruins site.

<doc id="338872" wikidata="Q2558373" url="?curid=338872" title="Freaky Friday">
<text>Freaky Friday is a comedic children&#x27;s novel written by Mary Rodgers, first published by Harper &amp; Row in 1972. It has been adapted for several films, namely by Disney, and these include 1976, 1995, 2003 and 2018.

The story features a day in the life of 13-year-old Annabel Andrews and her mother, who spend the day in each other&#x27;s bodies.

==Plot==
A willful, disorganized teenage girl, Annabel Andrews, awakens one Friday morning to find herself in the body of her mother, with whom she had argued the previous night.

Annabel suddenly finds herself in charge of the New York family&#x27;s affairs and must now take care of her younger brother Ben (whom Annabel has not-so-affectionately nicknamed &quot;Ape Face&quot; and described as &quot;so neat, it&#x27;s revolting!&quot;). She grows increasingly worried about the disappearance of &quot;Annabel,&quot; who appeared to be herself in the morning but has gone missing after leaving the Andrews&#x27; home, and she enlists the help of her neighbor and childhood friend, Boris, though without telling him about her identity crisis.

As the day wears on and Annabel has a series of increasingly bizarre and frustrating adventures, she becomes gradually more appreciative of how difficult her mother&#x27;s life is. She learns, to her surprise, that Ben idolizes her, and Boris is actually named Morris, but has a problem with chronic congestion (at least around Annabel) leading him to nasally pronounce &quot;m&quot;s and &quot;n&quot;s as &quot;b&quot;s and &quot;d&quot;s. As the novel approaches its climax, Ben also disappears, apparently having gone off with a gorgeous girl whom Boris did not recognize, but Ben appeared to trust without hesitation.

In the climax and dénouement, Annabel becomes overwhelmed by the difficulties of her situation, the apparent disappearance of her mother, the loss of the children, and the question of how her odd situation came about and when/whether it will be resolved. Finally, it is revealed that Annabel&#x27;s mother herself caused them to switch bodies through some unspecified means, and the mysterious teen beauty who took Ben was Mrs. Andrews in Annabel&#x27;s body (to which she is restored) made much more attractive by a makeover Mrs. Andrews gave the body while using it, including the removal of Annabel&#x27;s braces, an appointment Annabel had forgotten about (and would have missed, had she been the one in her body that day).

==Characters==
;Annabel Andrews
:Disorganized, rebellious, tomboyish, 13-year-old Annabel struggles with her mother&#x27;s bossiness and believes that adults have it easy. She finds herself out of her depth when faced with adult responsibilities and concerns.
;Ben Andrews, a.k.a. Ape Face
:A pre-adolescent younger sibling, 6-year-old Ben enjoys creating conflict with Annabel, which has led to her nicknaming him Ape Face. Unknown to Annabel, he and his friends admire Annabel, and he wears the nickname as a badge of honor. The truth comes out when she slips up and calls him Ape Face while her mind is in Mrs. Andrews&#x27; body. After she apologizes, he admits that he likes the name, but wants to keep this secret from Annabel.
;Morris/Boris
:A childhood friend of Annabel, he has been somewhat afraid of her since a sandbox incident in which she cut his head open with a shovel. Deciding she played too rough, he and his mother have made a point of him avoiding Annabel. He is described as a cheerful, charming and handsome young gentleman, and does his best to help &quot;Mrs. Andrews&quot; (really Annabel) as she struggles through a tough day. He has some occasional breathing trouble, attributed to his adenoids and possibly a psychosomatic reaction to his own mother, which renders his voice nasal, making him unable to pronounce the letters &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; clearly. Because of this, Annabel has always believed his name to be Boris, when it is in fact Morris. However, she suffers the opposite misunderstanding when he offers to prepare a &quot;beetloaf&quot; for a dinner party with the limited assortment of culinary ingredients available. She believes he is going to save dinner by providing a much more sensible meatloaf, but she is won over when she samples the new dish and finds it tasty.
;Ellen Jean Benjamin Andrews
:Despite setting the events in motion and later ending them deus ex machina-style, Mrs. Andrews remains (along with Annabel&#x27;s body, which she has taken) an unseen character for much of the book, only revealing herself and what she has done at the end of the day.

== Themes ==
It themes include empathy and understanding, generational conflict, self-discovery, love and family bonds, and coming of age. The novel delves into the concept of empathy as a mother and daughter switch bodies, fostering a deeper understanding of each other&#x27;s lives. It also addresses the common conflicts and misunderstandings that can arise between generations, particularly between parents and their teenage children. Both the mother and daughter undergo personal growth and self-discovery as they navigate each other&#x27;s lives.

==Sequel novels==
Mary Rodgers wrote two sequels featuring the Andrews family. In &quot;A Billion for Boris&quot; (October 1974), Annabel and her friend Morris/Boris discover a TV set that tunes into future broadcasts and begin betting on horse races.

In &quot;Summer Switch&quot; (September 1982), Annabel&#x27;s little brother Ben and their father Bill inadvertently switch bodies as both are leaving for the summer, leaving the boy to negotiate in Hollywood and Dad to attend summer camp. All three Andrews family novels were soon published in Harper Trophy trade paperback editions. In later HarperTrophy editions, the second story has been titled &quot;ESP TV&quot; (1999) and &quot;A Billion for Boris: Also known as ESP TV&quot; (2003).

Additionally, a thematic sequel co-written by Rodgers and Heather Hach was published by The Bowen Press and HarperCollins Publishers LLC, in May 2009 titled: &quot;Freaky Monday&quot;. In the story an orderly schedule oriented 13-year-old schoolgirl Hadley, and a spontaneous easy-going teacher named Ms. Pitt inexplicably swap bodies. Similar to the previous books, the pair search for a quick resolution, but find a level of respect for each other in the process.

==Film adaptations==
The novel was adapted into a number of films, by The Walt Disney Company spawning the successful titular franchise. The studio adapted the story through at various times in differing decades.

* Walt Disney Pictures first released the 1976 theatrical film with a screenplay written by Rodgers, starring Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster in the lead roles of Ellen and Annabel Andrews.
* In 1995, the studio released a second adaptation which premiered on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) as a part of The Wonderful World of Disney exclusive films. The project was titled &quot;Disney&#x27;s Freaky Friday&quot;, and starred Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann as Ellen and Annabel Andrews. For the movie, the characters unintentionally switched bodies by means of magical amulets when they both expressed envy for the other&#x27;s seemingly simpler existence.
* Disney later released the 2003 theatrical film, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan as Tess and Anna Coleman, respectively. The pair are switched by mystical means, through words written on the papers within fortune cookies given to them by a meddling elderly Chinese woman after overhearing their argument at her daughter&#x27;s restaurant. Referencing the second novel, the end of the movie the owner of the restaurant stops her mother from once again interfering in other peoples&#x27; lives as she tries to give magical fortune cookies to the son and father of Tess.
* Disney Channel and Disney Theatrical Productions produced another television film, adapting the musical of the same name, which premiered in August 2018; Heidi Blickenstaff reprises her role as the mother, while Cozi Zuehlsdorff portrays her daughter. The protagonists&#x27; names were changed to Katherine and Ellie Blake, respectively.

Additionally, a limited theatrical release and adaptation of the first sequel book was released with the title of &quot;A Billion for Boris&quot; in 1985. The movie was later released via pay-per-view television on Disney Channel in 1987, before receiving a broadcast debut in 1988 through Columbus Broadcasting System (CBS). With a plot faithful to the source material, the movie featured recurring characters with: Mary Tanner as Annabel Andrews, Sally Stark as Ellen Andrews, Scott Tiler as Boris Harris, and Seth Green as Benjamin &quot;Ape-Face&quot; Andrews. In 1984, a television film adaptation of the second sequel novel was released with the titled as &quot;Summer Switch&quot;. Starring Robert Klein and Scott Schwartz, the movie was released as a part of the ABC Afterschool Special originals. Which can be confused with the similar named but unrelated 1994 TV movie &quot;Summertime Switch&quot; starring Rider Strong and Jason Weaver where two characters with similar names get placed on the wrong transit bus only to be sent to the other individual&#x27;s destination. &quot;Fast&quot; Freddie Egan (Jason Weaver) was intended to go to a juvenile detention correctional boot camp, while Frederick Egan III&#x27;s (Rider Strong) destination should have been a country club resort summer camp. Through the course of events, each gains appreciation for a different lifestyle while learning important lessons about themselves. 

===Analysis===
Comparing the novel and the film, differences can be seen in the presence of an outside influence switching the often-bickering mother and daughter against both of their wills. This change makes both characters protagonists; each movie starting shortly before the switch depicting the conflicts between them, before following the individual characters&#x27; struggles through the other&#x27;s daily lives and ultimately gaining an added level of respect for each other. In the first film, the screenwriter and original book author Mary Rodgers added a hobby for Annabel which includes an important competition, for which her mother has lack of experience and skill, serving as the climax of the movie. This addition has been included in some form through each subsequent adaptation: waterskiing in the 1976 film, competitive diving in the 1995 adaptation, a Battle of the Bands musical competition in the 2003 movie, and a school sponsored scavenger hunt in the 2018 adaptation of the musical. Additionally, a simultaneous important event for the mother character was added to the 2003 film, to include her wedding rehearsal dinner.

In the first movie, Morris is changed to a character named Boris and is adjusted to be Annabel&#x27;s love interest, rather than beginning the story as a rival of hers. In the 1995 and 2003 adaptations, the role is renamed as Luke and Jake, respectively. In each of the films, the character comedically falls in love with the mother due to the daughter&#x27;s consciousness being in her body. Noteworthily, Marc McClure portrays the character of Boris in both the 1976 original film and in a cameo role in the 2003 release where the character is now a delivery man; establishing both films take place in the same loose continuity.

===Legacy===
&quot;Freaky&quot; (2020), directed by Christopher Landon from a screenplay by Landon and Michael Kennedy, was inspired by &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;″s basic plot, and is integrated into a horror-comedy slasher film. The movie stars Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton as an infamous serial killer and a tormented high school student, respectively; who switch bodies after the former stabs her with an ancient dagger. The film&#x27;s working title was &quot;Freaky Friday the 13th&quot;.

==Stage musical ==
An adaptation for a stage musical was developed by Disney Theatrical Productions, with the music written by Tom Kitt and lyrics written by Brian Yorkey; with an accompanying book and stage-play script by Bridget Carpenter. The musical began performances at the Signature Theatre, Arlington, Virginia on October 4, 2016. Directed by Christopher Ashley, with choreography by Sergio Trujillo, the cast features Emma Hunton (as the daughter Ellie), Jason Gotay and Heidi Blickenstaff (as the mother Katherine). Ashley explained that the musical is based on the original Rodgers book as well as the films. The musical is set in the present-day Chicago. Later, the musical debuted performances at the La Jolla Playhouse, San Diego, on January 31, 2017, and ran to March 12. The cast features Emma Hunton and Heidi Blickenstaff. This was followed by runs at Cleveland Play House in April and the Alley Theatre in June.

Disney Channel released a television film adaptation of the stage musical, in the summer of 2018. Blickenstaff reprised her role as the mother Katherine, while Cozi Zuehlsdorff starred as the daughter Ellie. Carpenter returned to adapt the musical as a teleplay, while Kitt and Yorkey returned to oversee the music and lyrics. The TV adaptation was produced by Susan Cartsonis and Thomas Schumacher.

<text>SuperWaba is a discontinued Java-like virtual machine (VM) that targets portable devices. Software developers use application programming interfaces (APIs), accessed through associated libraries (packaged as Jars) and small tools (together composing a software development kit), to create applications that can run within the VM on supported platforms.

==Architecture==
The SuperWaba VM and API implement a subset of the Java programming language, which allows it to run under a standard Java VM or as a Java applet. This is in contrast to the Java Micro Edition which was designed under a different Java specification than that used by the Java Standard Edition. Classes compiled for the SuperWaba VM must be compiled for Java 2, Standard Edition 1.2 compatibility.

Note that the SuperWaba VM does not conform to a particular specification. However, the SuperWaba API allows recompiling an application&#x27;s classes to the Java Standard Edition. When an application is retargeted in this way, all versions of the Java Standard Edition are supported.

Despite its likeness to the Java 2 standard edition specification, SuperWaba is appropriately constrained for hardware limitations typically encountered on portable devices. Especially, the SuperWaba VM has been optimized for use on devices with small screens. Compiled code runs at 1/3 to 1/2 the speed of a pure C application on a Palm platform, and on a Windows API (Win32) platform is approximately three to four times faster than a JIT-compiled Java due partly to its integer-only implementation. Additional mathematics libraries for non-integer arithmetic are provided with the SDK.

The SuperWaba VM and API are both extensible. They are published under the GPL free software license. Also, licensees may buy an LGPL version, that lets them link it with proprietary software. Applications and libraries written for SuperWaba may be sold, but most appear to be available as free software from the main website.

==History==
SuperWaba evolved from the Waba project which was an independent forerunner of Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). SuperWaba had initial support only for Palm OS; starting in version 3, it added support for Windows CE, as the prior Waba VM.

Since the 5.0 release, SuperWaba has used the SDL library for driving the display, which increases its portability to many other platforms.

The support for SuperWaba has ceased and its successor, TotalCross, is the primary mobile SDK. Totalcross Beta 4 was released on January 12, 2009. TotalCross, a superior solution to SuperWaba, offers greater platform stability, leaner compilation of Java code, and added ability in a smaller footprint.

==Integration and support==
SuperWaba applications can be developed under any JDK supporting Java 1.2 or greater, and the libraries and tools integrate with development environments such as Eclipse, JBuilder, etc. The VM runs on the following platforms:
* Windows CE 2.11 and above
* Pocket PC: Axim, iPAQ, others
* Palm OS 2.0 and above
* Palm OS 5 optimized for ARM CPUs
* Symbian series 60 and UIQ devices
* Linux: Debian, Red Hat, others
* Windows 98, XP, Me, 2000
* Browser-based Java applets

SuperWaba libraries offer a variety of abilities, from barcode scanners to complex mathematics. The SuperWaba website features a wiki for developers and users to contribute to the project.

<doc id="338882" wikidata="Q16209265" url="?curid=338882" title="Bomber Command">
<text>Bomber Command is an organisational military unit, generally subordinate to the air force of a country. The best known were in Britain and the United States. A Bomber Command is generally used for strategic bombing (although at times, e.g. during the Normandy Landings, may be used for tactical bombing), and is composed of bombers (i.e. planes used to bomb targets).

== RAF Bomber Command ==

RAF Bomber Command was formed in 1936 to be responsible for all bombing activities of the RAF. It found especial fame during World War II, when its aircraft were used for devastating night-time air raids on Germany and occupied Europe, principally the former, their bombing raids causing tremendous destruction of urban areas and factories.

Much of its personnel was drawn from outside the United Kingdom, many coming from the British Empire. Under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, many Commonwealth countries contributed squadrons or individuals to British air and ground staff. For example, No. 6 Group, which represented about one-sixth of Bomber Command&#x27;s strength, was a Royal Canadian Air Force unit. Some non-British personnel came from occupied European countries.

At its height, Bomber Command under Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris could put over 1,000 aircraft into the air over Germany. Over 12,000 Bomber Command aircraft were shot down during World War II, and 55,500 aircrew were killed, the highest attrition rate of any British unit.

Various aircraft were used, from the obsolete and horrendously vulnerable Fairey Battle in 1939 to the command&#x27;s most numerous and successful aircraft, the Avro Lancaster. Bomber Command used not only British aircraft but also American-built machines such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator (although less than 2% of Bomber Command&#x27;s wartime sorties were flown by US-built aircraft); in the case of the former they were the first to be put into battle and gave useful information on improvements before the US entered the war.

RAF Bomber Command was merged into RAF Strike Command in 1968.

== USAAF ==

Whereas the Bomber Command in the RAF was a single organisation, reporting directly to the Chief of the Air Staff, there were many American Bomber Commands. They were subordinate formations, reporting in general to various numbered Air Forces around the world. Out of those organisations, four were tasked with strategic bombing of Germany and Japan. VIII Bomber Command, IX Bomber Command, XX Bomber Command and XXI Bomber Command.

=== VIII Bomber Command ===
VIII Bomber Command was the UK-based strategic bomber arm of the Eighth Air Force and contributed a substantial part of Operation Pointblank, the day-night bombing campaign by the RAF and USAAF to eliminate the Luftwaffe in preparation for the invasion of Europe. Two aircraft, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, and the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, were the mainstays of this command. The B-17 was more highly regarded, but the Liberator had a greater range and a larger bomb load. VIII Bomber Command, known as &quot;Pinetree&quot;, began strategic operations in Europe on 17 August 1942, with daylight missions on the precept that daylight attacks were more accurate than night attacks. However the RAF and the Luftwaffe had both tried daylight bombing early in the war and abandoned it in the face of serious losses. Until June, 1943, VIII Bomber Command could not mount missions of more than 100 aircraft and consequently limited targets to those in Occupied France and the Low Countries, and to shallow penetrations of Germany. Attempts to attack the German aircraft industry during the summer and fall of 1943, beyond the range of escort fighters, resulted in critical losses of aircrew. Not until long range escort fighters such as the North American P-51 Mustang became available in sizeable numbers did daylight bombing become effective. In January 1944, VIII Bomber Command was re-designated the 8th Air Force when the United States Strategic Air Forces came into being to coordinate the combined efforts of the 8th and the 15th Air Force in Italy.

=== IX Bomber Command ===
IX Bomber Command was part of the Ninth Air Force and had started life as the heavy bomber unit contingent of the U.S. Army Forces in the Middle East (USAFIME) fighting in the Egypt-Libya Campaign during 1942. When in 1943, the Ninth Air Force moved from the Mediterranean Theater of Operations to the United Kingdom to become a tactical air force in the European Theater of Operations, the B-24s transferred to Twelfth Air Force, then to the newly created Fifteenth. IX Bomber Command equipped with Martin B-26 medium bombers and Douglas A-20 light bombers in preparation for the Normandy Invasion.

=== XX Bomber Command ===
XX Bomber Command was part of the Twentieth Air Force and flew missions from China against mainland Japan in Operation Matterhorn.

The forward airbases in China were supplied out of India by the flying supplies over the Hump from India.

The key development for bombing Japan was the Boeing B-29, with an operational range of 1500 miles (2,400 km); almost 90% of the bombs dropped on Japan&#x27;s Home Islands (147,000 tons) were delivered by B-29s. The first mission from China was on June 15, 1944, from Chengdu, over 1500 miles away. This first attack was not particularly damaging to Japan. Only forty-seven of the sixty-eight B–29s airborne hit the target area in Tokyo; four aborted with mechanical problems, four crashed, six jettisoned their bombs because of mechanical difficulties, and others bombed secondary targets or targets of opportunity. Only one B–29 was lost to enemy aircraft.

Bombing from China was never a satisfactory arrangement because not only were the Chinese forward airbases difficult to supply via &quot;The Hump&quot; (as the Himalayas&#x27; foothills were called), but the B-29s operating from them could only reach Japan if they substituted some of the bomb load for extra fuel tanks in the bomb-bays. When Admiral Chester Nimitz&#x27;s island-hopping campaign captured islands close enough to Japan to be within the range of B-29s, XXI Bomber Command commanded Twentieth Air Force units flying from the islands in a much more effective bombing campaign of the Japanese home islands.

=== XXI Bomber Command ===
In the Pacific, XXI Bomber Command was also part of the Twentieth Air Force. It was the main instrument of destruction used against Japan. Its B-29 Superfortresses, operating from the Marianas, were the longest range and most modern bomber in service in the world at the time, although not developed until almost the end of the war. Again, as in Europe, the USAAF tried daylight precision bombing. However, it proved inconclusive because of poor weather conditions, jet stream over Japan that severely affected both aircraft and bomb drops, and inadequately trained crews. Twentieth Air Force commander and AAF Commanding General Henry H. Arnold grew impatient with a lack of discernible results, and replaced General Haywood S. Hansell with General Curtis LeMay as commander of XXI Bomber Command on January 21, 1945. After six weeks of further attempts at precision bombing, LeMay acceded to command pressures for area bombing and switched in March to mass firebombing attacks by night from low level. The Japanese economy was uniquely vulnerable to this sort of attack, the cities being closely packed and largely built of wood, and manufacturing being 90% cottage industry.

The air attacks on Japan included the most devastating single air raid in history. It was not, as some might think, the result of dropping the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was a firebombing of Tokyo on the night of 9–10 March 1945, which created a conflagration and killed 100,000 people and destroyed 16 square miles of the city, far more damage and deaths than either the atomic bombing of Hiroshima or of Nagasaki.

<doc id="338883" wikidata="Q207991" url="?curid=338883" title="Pahlavi dynasty">
<text>The Pahlavi dynasty () was the last Iranian royal dynasty that ruled for roughly 53 years between 1925 and 1979. The dynasty was founded by Reza Shah Pahlavi, a non-aristocratic Mazanderani soldier in modern times, who took on the name of the Pahlavi language spoken in the pre-Islamic Sasanian Empire to strengthen his nationalist credentials.

The dynasty replaced the Qajar dynasty in 1925 after the 1921 coup d&#x27;état, beginning on 14 January 1921 when 42-year-old soldier Reza Khan was promoted by British General Edmund Ironside to lead the British-run Persian Cossack Brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan&#x27;s 3,000–4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran in what became known as the 1921 Persian coup d&#x27;état. The rest of the country was taken by 1923, and by October 1925 the Majlis agreed to depose and formally exile Ahmad Shah Qajar. The Majlis declared Reza Pahlavi as the new Shah of Iran on 12 December 1925, pursuant to the Persian Constitution of 1906. Initially, Pahlavi had planned to declare the country a republic, as his contemporary Atatürk had done in Turkey, but abandoned the idea in the face of British and clerical opposition.

The dynasty ruled Iran for 28 years as a form of constitutional monarchy from 1925 until 1953, and following the overthrow of the elected prime minister, for a further 26 years as a more autocratic monarchy until the dynasty was itself overthrown in 1979.

==Family background==

In 1878, Reza Khan was born at the village of Alasht in Savadkuh County, Mazandaran Province. His parents were Abbas Ali Khan and Noushafarin Ayromlou. His mother was a Muslim immigrant from Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), whose family had emigrated to mainland Qajar Iran after Iran was forced to cede all of its territories in the Caucasus following the Russo-Persian Wars several decades prior to Reza Shah&#x27;s birth. His father was a Mazandarani, commissioned in the 7th Savadkuh Regiment, and served in the Anglo-Persian War in 1856.

==Heads of House of Pahlavi==

== Consorts ==

== Heirs ==

The former constitution of Iran specifically provided that only a male who was not descended from Qajar dynasty could become the heir apparent. This made all half-brothers of Mohammad Reza ineligible to become heirs to the throne. Until his death in 1954, the Shah&#x27;s only full brother Ali Reza was his heir presumptive.

The constitution also required the Shah to be of Iranian descent, meaning that his father and mother are Iranian.

However, the children by the last Shah&#x27;s sister Fatemeh, who married an American businessman as her first husband, are surnamed Pahlavi Hillyer and do not use any titles.

<doc id="338887" wikidata="Q207596" url="?curid=338887" title="Daryl Hannah">
<text>Daryl Hannah (born December 3, 1960) is an American actress and environmental activist. She made her film debut in Brian De Palma&#x27;s supernatural horror film &quot;The Fury&quot; (1978). She has starred in various films across the years, including as Pris Stratton in Ridley Scott&#x27;s science fiction thriller &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) and as Cathy Featherstone in Randal Kleiser&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Summer Lovers&quot; (1982), as the mermaid Madison in Ron Howard&#x27;s fantasy-romantic comedy &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), Roxanne Kowalski in the romantic comedy &quot;Roxanne&quot; (1987), Darien Taylor in Oliver Stone&#x27;s drama &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), and Annelle Dupuy Desoto in the comedy-drama &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989). In 2005, Hannah won a Saturn Award for her role as one-eyed assassin Elle Driver in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s martial arts action film &quot;Kill Bill: Vol. 2&quot;. In 2015, she appeared in the Netflix series &quot;Sense8&quot; as Angelica Turing.

==Early life==
Hannah was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Susan Jeanne Metzger, a producer and former schoolteacher, and Donald Christian Hannah, a tugboat and barge company owner. Her parents divorced, and her mother subsequently married businessman Jerrold Wexler, brother of cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Hannah grew up with siblings Don and Page Hannah and her maternal half-sister, Tanya Wexler, in Long Grove, Illinois. She was raised Roman Catholic.

Hannah became interested in movies at a young age, partly due to insomnia. She has said that she was very shy growing up. As a young child, Hannah was emotionally isolated and struggled in school. She was subsequently diagnosed with autism, and medical professionals urged her parents to have her institutionalized and medicated. Instead, her mother decided to relocate with Hannah temporarily to Jamaica, in hopes that the change in environment would help her daughter. Hannah later attended the progressive Francis W. Parker School in Chicago before enrolling at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where she studied ballet and acting.

==Career==
===Film and television===
Hannah made her film debut at age 17 in 1978 with an appearance in Brian De Palma&#x27;s horror film &quot;The Fury&quot;. She had an early role along with Rachel Ward in the 1983 horror film &quot;The Final Terror&quot;. The film was shot in 1981, but was released in 1983.

Hannah played the acrobatic and violent replicant Pris in Ridley Scott&#x27;s science fiction classic &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), in which she performed some of her own gymnastic stunts. That same year, she appeared in the summer hit release &quot;Summer Lovers&quot;. Her role as a mermaid in Ron Howard&#x27;s hit fantasy/comedy &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), opposite Tom Hanks brought her much recognition. Also in 1984, she appeared in &quot;The Pope of Greenwich Village&quot;, co-starring with Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts.
In 1985, Hannah appeared in and provided backing vocals in the music video &quot;You&#x27;re a Friend of Mine&quot;, performed by Clarence Clemons and Jackson Browne. She also appeared in the music video for Browne&#x27;s &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;. Hannah&#x27;s other roles during the 1980s included the film version of the best seller &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; (1986) and &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; (1986) starring Robert Redford and Debra Winger. She appeared in the Academy Award winning &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), for which she received a Razzie Award. Hannah starred in the title role of Fred Schepisi&#x27;s film &quot;Roxanne&quot; (1987), a modern retelling of Edmond Rostand&#x27;s play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. Her performance was described as &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;gentle&quot; by film critic Roger Ebert. She also starred in &quot;High Spirits&quot; (1988) opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole and ended the decade with Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989) and &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; featuring Sally Field, Shirley MacLaine and Julia Roberts (1989).

Hannah played the daughter of Jack Lemmon&#x27;s character in both of the &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; comedies. That same year, she played Nancy Archer in the HBO comedy remake of &quot;Attack Of The Fifty-Foot Woman&quot;. In 1995, Hannah was chosen by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as No. 96 of the &quot;100 Sexiest Stars in Film History.&quot; That year she appeared as homicidal sociopath Leann Netherwood in &quot;The Tie That Binds&quot;. In 1998 she played the co-lead to Christopher Reeve in the made-for-television film remake &quot;Rear Window&quot;. That same year she also starred in the direct-to-video film &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot; playing Morticia Addams.
Hannah played Elle Driver, a one-eyed assassin, in &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (2003), directed by Quentin Tarantino. Her performance in this film and her appearances in &quot;Speedway Junky&quot; (1999), &quot;Dancing at the Blue Iguana&quot; (2000), &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; (2002), &quot;Northfork&quot; (2003), &quot;Casa de los Babys&quot; (2003) and &quot;Silver City&quot; (2004), have been described by some reviewers as a comeback. After &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, she appeared in several TV films and miniseries, including the Syfy original film &quot;Shark Swarm&quot;, &quot;Final Days of Planet Earth&quot; for the Hallmark Channel, and &quot;Kung Fu Killer&quot; for Spike. She also appeared in &quot;Shannon&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;The Cycle&quot; in 2009.

In the 2010s, Hannah appeared in several films, including &quot;A Closed Book&quot; and &quot;Eldorado&quot;. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of &quot;A Closed Book&quot; that it allows curious fans to see what Hannah has been up to lately. In 2013, she starred in &quot;Zombie Night&quot;, a Syfy original film by The Asylum as well as in TV movie &quot;Social Nightmare&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Mother: She&#x27;ll Keep You Safe&quot;), a thriller by The Asylum about internet bullying. In 2013, she joined &quot;Skin Traffik&quot;, and, in 2014, she signed on to &quot;Signs of Death&quot;.

Beginning in 2015, Hannah portrayed Angelica Turing in &quot;Sense8&quot;, a series on Netflix from the Wachowskis. The series ran for two seasons, with a final episode released on June 8, 2018. Also in 2018, Hannah released &quot;Paradox&quot;, for which she served as writer and producer; the film featured musician Neil Young.

In 2020, Hannah starred in &quot;The Now&quot;, a comedy series for The Roku Channel opposite Dave Franco.

In 2023 she was nominated for a Grammy Award for best Music film for Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse&#x27;s &quot;A Band A Brotherhood A Barn&quot;.

===Theatre===
Hannah is also an accomplished theater actress, reprising Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s starring role in &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; in 2000 in London&#x27;s West End. Reviews of the play commended Hannah&#x27;s performance, with Lizzie Loveridge of &quot;Curtain Up!&quot; saying that the play was the &quot;perfect vehicle&quot; for Hannah to &quot;show her talents as a comedienne.&quot;

===Other work===
Hannah wrote, directed and produced a short film titled &quot;The Last Supper&quot;. She directed, produced, and was cinematographer for the documentary &quot;Strip Notes&quot;, which was broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK and on HBO and documented the research Hannah did for her role as a stripper in &quot;Dancing at the Blue Iguana&quot;.

In 2002, Hannah appeared in Robbie Williams&#x27; video for the song &quot;Feel&quot; portraying Williams&#x27; love interest.

Hannah and actress Hilary Shepard Turner created two board games, &quot;Love It or Hate It&quot; and &quot;LIEbrary&quot;, with Hannah previewing the latter on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; in 2005.

==Activism==

Hannah, an active environmentalist, created her own weekly video blog called &quot;DHLoveLife&quot; on sustainable solutions. She is often the sound recordist, camera person and on-screen host for the blog. As of 2006, her home—which was built with green materials—ran on solar power, and she drove a car that ran on biodiesel. She has been vegetarian since age 11, and later became vegan. In late 2006, she volunteered to act as a judge for Treehugger.com&#x27;s &quot;Convenient Truths&quot; contest. On December 4, 2008, Hannah joined Sea Shepherd Conservation Society&#x27;s crew aboard the as part of Operation Musashi.

On June 13, 2006, Hannah was arrested, along with actor Taran Noah Smith, for her involvement with over 350 farmers, their families and supporters, confronting authorities trying to bulldoze the largest urban farm in the U.S., located in South Central Los Angeles. She chained herself to a walnut tree at the South Central Farm for three weeks to protest against the farmers&#x27; eviction by the property&#x27;s new owner, Ralph Horowitz. The farm had been established in the wake of the 1992 L.A. riots to allow people in the city to grow food for themselves. However, Horowitz, who had paid $5 million for it, sought to evict the farmers to build a warehouse. He had asked for $16 million to sell it but turned down the offer when the activists raised that amount after the established deadline. Hannah was interviewed via cell phone shortly before she was arrested, along with 44 other protesters, and said that she and the others are doing the &quot;morally right thing&quot;. She spent some time in jail.

Hannah has also worked to help end sexual slavery and has traveled around the world to make a documentary.

Hannah was among 31 people arrested on June 23, 2009, in a protest against mountaintop removal in southern West Virginia, part of a wider campaign to stop the practice in the region. The protesters, who also included NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, were charged with obstructing officers and impeding traffic after they sat in the middle of State Route 3 outside Massey Energy&#x27;s Goals Coal preparation plant, &quot;The Charleston Gazette&quot; reported. In a &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; phone interview on June 24, 2009, Hannah spoke briefly on why she went to West Virginia and risked arrest.
Hannah was arrested on August 30, 2011, in front of the White House as part of a sit-in to protest against the proposed Keystone oil pipeline from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. In a &quot;Huffington Post&quot; piece co-authored with Phil Radford, Hannah explained that the purpose of her action was to &quot;shine the light&quot; on the President&#x27;s decision on the pipeline for &quot;millions of voters&quot; to see. In October 2011, Hannah and other pipeline opponents rode horses and bicycles and walked from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to the Rosebud Reservation to protest the project.

Hannah was the executive producer of &quot;Greedy Lying Bastards&quot;, a 2012 documentary against climate change denial.

In September 2012, Hannah signed environmental activist Tom Weis&#x27; open letter calling on President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney to withdraw their support for the construction of the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, that would transport oil sands from Montana to Texas. Other signatories included climate scientist James Hansen and actors Sheryl Lee, Mariel Hemingway, and Ed Begley Jr. On October 4, 2012, Hannah was arrested and jailed in Wood County, Texas, for criminal trespassing. She and a local landowner, 78-year-old Eleanor Fairchild, were arrested while protesting against the TransCanada Keystone XL oil sands pipeline by attempting to block heavy construction equipment. Although they were charged with trespassing, they were in fact protesting on Fairchild&#x27;s land. On February 13, 2013, Hannah was arrested at the White House along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Conor Kennedy during a climate change protest against the proposed Keystone Pipeline.

On April 26, 2014, in Washington, Hannah and Neil Young led a march by the &quot;Cowboy and Indian Alliance&quot; group against the Obama administration to reject the proposed Keystone Pipeline.

Hannah endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for president in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

She is a member of the World Future Council.

==Personal life==

Hannah had long-term relationships with John F. Kennedy Jr. and musician Jackson Browne. She and Browne began dating in 1983 and broke up in 1992 amid unsubstantiated rumors that Browne had been physically abusive to her. Browne later prevailed in a defamation dispute with Fox Television which issued a retraction. Hannah began a relationship with musician Neil Young in 2014, and they married in 2018.

Hannah was among the numerous women who brought sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. In a part of Ronan Farrow&#x27;s 2017 exposé, Hannah claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed her multiple times during the production of &quot;Kill Bill&quot; and that he once tried to break into her hotel room. Fearing that he intended to rape her, she fled the room through a fire escape. Hannah later expressed belief that Weinstein sabotaged her career in retaliation for refusing his advances, as she struggled to find work after appearing in &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.

<doc id="338894" wikidata="Q1545700" url="?curid=338894" title="Truancy">
<text>Truancy is any intentional, unjustified, unauthorized, or illegal absence from compulsory education. It is a deliberate absence by a student&#x27;s own free will and usually does not refer to legitimate excused absences, such as ones related to medical conditions. Truancy is usually explicitly defined in the school&#x27;s handbook of policies and procedures. Attending school but not going to class is called &quot;internal truancy&quot;. Some children whose parents claim to homeschool have also been found truant in the United States. 

In many countries, truancy is criminalized by law as either a criminal or a civil offense, and authorities can prosecute truant students (under the age of 18), their parents, or both. Some countries, like Canada or Australia, reserve fines for truant minors and allow for their detainment (but not arrest) while skipping school. In Russia, Germany and some parts of the U.S. police officers even have the power to handcuff and arrest truant under-18s on the streets during the school hours. Strict measures against truancy are usually motivated by compulsory education gaps among children and underage crime surge in big cities.

Truancy is a frequent subject of popular culture. &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; is about the title character&#x27;s (played by Matthew Broderick) day of truancy in Chicago with his girlfriend and best friend. &quot;Truancy&quot; is also the title of a 2008 novel about a student uprising against a dictatorial educational system. 
The term truant can also be used to describe a child that avoids duty, or is unruly, although this use is uncommon.

==History==
In older English, a or truand was any vagrant, vagabond, or shirker of duties.

The widespread legal obligation for towns and villages to provide free education did not evolve until the late-19th century and was born in such legislation as the Education (Scotland) Act 1872. Over and above the obligation within such legislation for local government to provide school-buildings and -teachers, there was also a counterpart requirement for children to actually attend an educational institution, and thus the modern legal concept of school-oriented truancy was born.

Most private schools had the concept of punishing pupils for non-attendance. This was done on a reverse principle: and schools had in principle to get the permission of parents to punish children.

==Slang expressions==
There are a number of expressions in most languages which refer to truancy.

* Argentina: &quot;ratearse&quot;.
* Bosnia and Herzegovina: &quot;escaping&quot; or &quot;eluding&quot;.

* Germany: &quot;schwänzen&quot;.
* Guyana: &quot;skulking&quot;.

* New Zealand and Australia: &quot;wagging&quot;, &quot;jigging&quot;, &quot;ditching&quot;, &quot;bludging&quot;, or &quot;skipping school&quot;.
* Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders) &quot;spijbelen&quot;, &quot;schoolziek&quot;.
* Pakistan and India: &quot;bunking&quot;.

** Greater Manchester: &quot;legging&quot;.
** Wales: &quot;sagging&quot;, &quot;on the mitch&quot;.
** Scotland: &quot;on the hop&quot;, &quot;doggin it&quot;, &quot;beaking&quot; or &quot;on the beak&quot;, &quot;ticking it&quot;.

** Utah: a &quot;sluff&quot; commonly refers to a truancy.

==Punishments imposed==
=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, some welfare benefits may be confiscated for a period if the child does not attend school. However, not all cities use this approach to keep the children in school. Most cities watch for families who have not returned their children to school after the summer vacation because some groups exiled their children to their ethnic home countries for behavior modification. In the city of Aarhus, 155 children had not attended one week after school started. In April 2009, research among 4,000 students showed that more than one in three had been absent during the past 14 days.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, truant pupils are usually punished with detention in comprehensive schools. The police are not involved in truancy control, but teachers monitor the school and its surrounding area to avoid unauthorized absences. If a pupil is absent for a long period of time, the parents may be fined. The child will not be escorted to school, but the government may remove the child from the household if truancy continues.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, truancy is prohibited until the age of 18, and parents can be fined up to 1,250 euros or jailed if their child misses too much school. The students themselves can also be imprisoned for truancy from age 14 to 18, because the criminal responsibility age is 14 in Germany. The students older than 18 cannot be held criminally liable for truancy. The parents of a child absent from school without a legitimate excuse are notified by the school. If the parents refuse to send their child to school or are unable to control their child, local child services or social services officers may request the police to escort the child to school, and in extreme cases may petition a court to partially or completely remove child custody from the parents.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, Attendance Officers (AO) are key figures helping students cope with difficulties of adjustment in school, which can cause them to drop out of the education system altogether. AOs are employed by the local authority, as authorized by the Minister of Education, and their role is to ensure that the Compulsory Education Law is implemented in educational institutions for all 15 years of compulsory schooling.  In recent years, efforts have been made to professionalize and structure the role of attendance officer.  A 2016 study of the AO role found there had been a change in the focus of the AOs&#x27; work – from concentrating on students who do not regularly attend an educational framework to intervention at an earlier stage with students who are still in a formal educational framework, but are experiencing adjustment difficulties. The data over the period from 2006 to 2016 indicated a decline in the relative percentage of students not in formal education (dropouts) out of all students in the care of AOs, and that most of those in the care of an AO did attend a formal framework.  At the end of the period of AO intervention, 38% of the students who were not in an educational framework when the AO began work with them had returned to a formal framework. Among those who had been in a framework at the start of work but were contending with various difficulties, almost 90% were still in the framework at the end of the intervention.  Finally, the data noted the multiple difficulties facing AOs working with the Bedouin population and with students in East Jerusalem, as well as the limited resources available to them.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, compulsory education starts at six years of age and finishes at 16, but truancy constitutes a crime only for the elementary-school level.

=== Taiwan ===
Truancy is subject to an administrative fine, which may be continued until proper enrollment in the compulsory education.

=== United Kingdom ===
In England and Wales, truancy is a criminal offense for parents if the child concerned is registered at school. Truancy laws do not apply to children educated at home or otherwise under Section 7 of the Education Act 1996. Since the passage of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, parents of persistent truants may be imprisoned for up to three months. In 2002, the first parent was imprisoned under this provision.

Since 1998, a police officer of or above the rank of superintendent may direct that for a specified time in a specified area a police officer may remove a child believed to be absent from a school without authority to that school or to another designated place. However, this is neither a power of arrest nor a power to detain, and it does not make truancy a criminal offense. A warning is issued to parents following the first instance of truancy, but for subsequent events, the parents are assessed a fine of at least £50. Some charities have highlighted an increasing prevalence of truancy among impoverished girls during menstruation, especially among girls who do not have easy access to sanitary products.

=== United States ===
In the United States, truancy regulations are generally enforced by school officials under the context of parental responsibility. New automated calling systems allow the automated notification of parents when a child is not marked present in the computer, and truancy records for many states are available for inspection online. In large schools where law enforcement officers are present, the fine for truancy can range from $250 to as much as $500. About 12,000 students were ticketed for truancy in 2008 in Los Angeles. Many states provide for the appointment of local truancy officers who have the authority to arrest habitually truant youths and bring them to their parents or to the school that they are supposed to attend. Many states also have the power to revoke a student&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license or permit. Where it exists, a school truancy officer is often concurrently a constable or sheriff.

Children are required by law to remain in school until the age of 16, although some states require schooling through age 18 unless an absence is formally excused by a school official or if the child has been expelled. In the 1972 case of &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot;, the Supreme Court determined that Amish children could not be placed under compulsory education laws past the eighth grade.

Children in private school or homeschooling are exempt from attending mandatory public schooling.

==Truant&#x27;s Day==
In Poland and the Faroe Islands, the first day of spring (March 21) is an unofficial occasion popular among children, who traditionally are truant on that day. In some American high schools, a &quot;senior skip day&quot; may be organized, often without the school&#x27;s consent. The date for the skip day varies among different schools. In the Eastern United States, skip day often occurs on the last Friday before spring break or on the Monday following the school&#x27;s prom.

<doc id="338902" wikidata="Q1290276" url="?curid=338902" title="Meditrinalia">
<text>The Meditrinalia was a festival in the traditional Roman religion, celebrated on October 11 in honor of the new vintage, which was offered as libations to the gods for the first time each year. Though now obscure, the festival may have been so called from &quot;medendo&quot;, Latin for &quot;healing&quot;, because the Romans then began to drink new wine, which they mixed with old and considered to have healing properties.

Little information about the Meditrinalia survived from early Roman religion, although the tradition itself did. It was known to be somehow connected to Jupiter and to have been an important ceremony in early agricultural Rome, but beyond that, only speculation exists.

A goddess, Meditrina, seems to have been a late Roman invention to account for the origin of the festival. The earliest account associating the Meditrinalia with such a goddess was of the 2nd century grammarian Sextus Pompeius Festus, on the basis of which Meditrina is asserted by modern sources to be the Roman goddess of health, longevity and wine, with an etymological meaning of &quot;healer&quot; suggested by some.

The construction of Shan Ha Wai was begun in 1847 by the wealthy granite merchant and stonemason Tsang Koon-Man as a stronghold for the Tsang clan, and took around 20 years to complete. The founder situated his rural fortress so he could access his business ventures in the city reasonably. Also purchasing the best agricultural land in the surrounding valley alongside the village to afford a stable income when there were inevitable economic recessions. The high fortified walls and defensive gate offering protection protecting the families inside from the troubled times and night robberies of late-imperial China. The original granite, bricks and solid timber are still preserved today. The complex is rectangular and consists of three rows of houses enclosed by grey brick walls. The four corners each feature a three-story guard tower with openings in the wall through which guns could be fired back in the early days of the complex&#x27;s role as a defensive fortification. All the houses are interlinked by passages and small courtyards. In the innermost row of houses is an ancestral hall where meetings and ceremonies took place. There are three arched entrances in the northern wall. The main or ceremonial entrance is in the middle and leads to the ancestral hall. In front of the main building is a massive courtyard, where villagers traditionally winnowed and dried their harvest. It also contained a study hall where the Tsang children were tutored before schools existed.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Shan Ha Wai was 56. The number of males was 24.

Shan Ha Wai gained its current name Tsang Tai Uk from locals when it housed displaced families after the Second World War.

During the 1970s development of the Sha Tin New Town, the surrounding area was developed significantly. During the course of new town development in Hong Kong, sometimes villages were relocated. However, Tsang Tai Uk was preserved due to its historical significance. In 1979, the village had about 700 residents, of whom about 300 belonged to the Tsang clan. Prince Charles, a former archaeology and history student, visited Tsang Tai Uk on 4 March 1979 during a royal tour.

The land reclaimed from Tide Cove upon which the Sha Tin New Town was built was formed to an average of five or six metres above sea level. However, Tsang Tai Uk is only 2.5 or three metres above sea level, and historically suffered from flooding. During Typhoon Wanda in 1962, the village was badly flooded, with the ground level having been completely inundated. In the late 1970s, the government devised a drainage improvement plan.

==Conservation==
Tsang Tai Uk is listed as a Grade I historic building. Restoration work of the ancestral hall started in 2009, after a HK$ 1m Government grant on maintenance of privately owned graded historic buildings had been approved. Visitors are permitted in the first courtyard and ancestral hall; the remaining courtyards and buildings are private.

<text>Dating Do&#x27;s and Don&#x27;ts is a 1949 instructional film designed for American high schools, to teach adolescents basic dating skills, produced by Coronet Instructional Films and directed by Gilbert Altschul with the assistance of Reuben Hill, Research Professor of Family Life at the University of North Carolina.

== Background ==
In this film, the boy is the sole initiator of any contact with the girl, and all arrangements are made under the warm supervision of the family, particularly a mother who is a matriarchal housewife. This film, as many of the other educational shorts of the post World War II era, denotes the traditional socially conservative values that were common in the early to mid 20th century. His mother, as the film was released in the late 1940s, was raised during the end of the Victorian Era, in the 1910s or 1920s decade, supposing she is middle aged, where the custom of &quot;courtship&quot; was commonplace and is new to the &quot;dating&quot; concept, but she accepted it.

The film is one of many public domain films in the Prelinger archives.

==Cast==
* Jackie Gleason as Ann Davis (uncredited)
* John Lindsay as Alan Woodruff (uncredited)

== Woody&#x27;s first date ==

The film follows a young adolescent boy named Allan Woodrow, aka Woody, who receives tickets for &quot;one couple&quot; to the Hi Teen Carnival. At different stages, the film offers options on how Woody might respond to various situations:
# What kind of girl should he date?
# How should he ask her out?
# How should he say good night after the date is over?
The film then shows three options, for each opportunity, ending with what it deems the most successful. This allows the filmmakers to create an idealized scenario for a perfect first date. Woody is cautioned not to ask a girl out based on her looks as she could be aloof or boring. Instead he should ask a girl who is &quot;fun&quot;. He is similarly told to be straightforward and not to insist that his potential date give up some other activity for him. Finally, the film depicts the perceived danger of immediately kissing the girl good night, or of just leaving her at her door, and instead urges the viewers to say a friendly goodbye, ending with a promise to call next week.

As Woody prepares for his date with Anne, he receives hints from his older brother, who is already an expert at dating; for instance, Woody&#x27;s brother tells Woody to act like his &quot;natural, talkative self&quot; while on the phone, and says that Woody does not have to bring Anne flowers on her first date. He also convinces their mother to allow Woody to go on his first date even though he is young, with her adding that it would be acceptable provided that Woody only dates on weekends and comes home at a reasonable hour. As Woody prepares for his date, his mother and father reflect on their own first dates to remind Woody how important it is for him to show up on time. His mother adds that any girl who is not ready for him on time is not worthy of going out with &quot;my boy&quot;.

The film ends with Woody leaving the door outside Anne&#x27;s home, whistling happily as he contemplates his next date.

<doc id="338909" wikidata="Q2567" url="?curid=338909" title="Richard von Weizsäcker">
<text>Richard Karl [[Freiherr]] von Weizsäcker (; 15 April 1920 – 31 January 2015) was a German politician (CDU), who served as President of Germany from 1984 to 1994. Born into the aristocratic Weizsäcker family, who were part of the German nobility, he took his first public offices in the Protestant Church in Germany.

A member of the CDU since 1954, Weizsäcker was elected as a member of parliament at the 1969 elections. He continued to hold a mandate as a member of the Bundestag until he became Governing Mayor of West Berlin, following the 1981 state elections. In 1984, Weizsäcker was elected as President of the Federal Republic of Germany and was re-elected in 1989 for a second term. As yet, he and Theodor Heuss are the only two Presidents of the Federal Republic of Germany who have served two complete five-year-terms. On 3 October 1990, during his second term as president, the reorganized five states of the German Democratic Republic and East Berlin joined the Federal Republic of Germany, which made Weizsäcker President of a reunified Germany.

Weizsäcker is considered the most popular of Germany&#x27;s presidents, held in high regard particularly for his impartiality. His demeanor often saw him at odds with his party colleagues, particularly longtime Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He was famous for his speeches, especially one he delivered at the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe on 8 May 1985. Upon his death, his life and political work were widely praised, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling him &quot;a guardian of his nation&#x27;s moral conscience&quot;.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood, school and family ===

Richard von Weizsäcker was born on 15 April 1920 in the New Palace in Stuttgart, the son of diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker, a member of the Weizsäcker family, and his wife Marianne von Graevenitz, a daughter of Friedrich von Graevenitz (1861–1922), a General of the Infantry of the Kingdom of Württemberg. Ernst von Weizsäcker was a career diplomat who served as State Secretary at the Foreign Office for Nazi Germany and as Nazi Germany’s ambassador to the Holy See. The youngest of four children, Weizsäcker had two brothers, the physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and Heinrich von Weizsäcker who fell as a soldier in Poland at the beginning of World War II. The sister Adelheid (1916–2004) married Botho-Ernst Graf zu Eulenburg-Wicken (1903–1944), a landowner in East Prussia. Richard&#x27;s grandfather Karl von Weizsäcker had been Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Württemberg, and was ennobled in 1897 and raised to the hereditary title of Baron (&quot;Freiherr&quot;) in 1916. His term in office ended in 1918, shortly before the monarchy was abolished in the German Revolution of 1918–1919. However, during the following years, he still occupied an apartment in the former royal palace where his grandson was born in an attic room.

Because his father was a career diplomat, Weizsäcker spent much of his childhood in Switzerland and Scandinavia. The family lived in Basel 1920–24, in Copenhagen 1924–26, and in Bern 1933–36, where Richard attended the Swiss Gymnasium Kirchenfeld. The family lived in Berlin, in an apartment in the Fasanenstraße in Wilmersdorf, between 1929 and 1933 and again from 1936 until the end of the Second World War. Weizsäcker was able to miss the third class of his elementary school, and entered a secondary school at the young age of nine, the &quot;Bismarck-Gymnasium&quot; (now the Goethe-Gymnasium) in Wilmersdorf. When he was 17 years old, Weizsäcker travelled to England to study philosophy and history at Balliol College, Oxford. In London, he witnessed the coronation of King George VI. He spent the winter semester of 1937/38 at the University of Grenoble in France to improve his French. He was mustered for the army there in 1938 and moved back to Germany the same year to start his &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot;.

=== Second World War ===

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Weizsäcker joined the , ultimately rising to the rank of captain in the reserves. He joined his brother Heinrich&#x27;s regiment, the Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam. He crossed over the border to Poland with his regiment on the very first day of the war. His brother Heinrich was killed about a hundred meters away from him on the second day. Weizsäcker watched over his brother&#x27;s body through the night, until he was able to bury him the next morning. His regiment, consisting in a large part of noble and conservative Prussians, played a significant part in the 20 July plot, with no fewer than nineteen of its officers involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. Weizsäcker himself helped his friend Axel von dem Bussche in an attempt to kill Hitler at a uniform inspection in December 1943, providing Bussche with travel papers to Berlin. The attempt had to be called off when the uniforms were destroyed by an air raid. Upon meeting Bussche in June 1944, Weizsäcker was also informed of the imminent plans for 20 July and assured him of his support, but the plan ultimately failed. Weizsäcker later described the last nine months of the war as &quot;agony&quot;. He was wounded in East Prussia in 1945 and was transported home to Stuttgart, to see out the end of the war on a family farm at Lake Constance.

=== Education, marriage and early work life ===

At the end of the war Weizsäcker continued his study of history in Göttingen and went on to study law, but he also attended lectures in physics and theology. In 1947, when his father Ernst von Weizsäcker was a defendant in the Ministries Trial for his role in the deportation of Jews from occupied France, Richard von Weizsäcker served as his assistant defence counsel. He took his first legal &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; in 1950, his second in 1953, and finally earned his doctorate (&quot;doctor juris&quot;) in 1955. In 1953 he married Marianne von Kretschmann. They had met when she was an 18-year-old schoolgirl and he was thirty. In 2010, Weizsäcker described the marriage as &quot;the best and smartest decision of my life&quot;. They had four children: Robert Klaus von Weizsäcker, a professor of economics at the Technical University of Munich, Andreas von Weizsäcker, an art professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, Beatrice von Weizsäcker, a lawyer and journalist, and , chief physician at the Schlosspark-Klinik in Berlin. In the late 1970s, his son Andreas was a student at the Odenwaldschule. When reports about sexual abuse there surfaced in 2010, it was speculated in the media that Andreas might have been one of the victims, but this was denied by the family. Andreas died of cancer in June 2008, aged 51. Weizsäcker&#x27;s son Fritz was murdered by a man armed with a knife on 19 November 2019, while holding a lecture at the Schlosspark-Klinik in Berlin, where he worked.

Weizsäcker worked for Mannesmann between 1950 and 1958, as a scientific assistant until 1953, as a legal counsel from 1953, and as head of the department for economic policy from 1957. From 1958 to 1962, he was head of the Waldthausen Bank, a bank owned by relatives of his wife. From 1962 to 1966, he served on the board of directors of Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceutical company. It was involved in production of the Agent Orange. This fact is speculated to be the motive behind the murder of his son in 2019, though the suspect has been sent to a secure hospital unit due to a &quot;delusional general aversion&quot; against the victim&#x27;s family.

== German Evangelical Church Assembly ==

Between 1964 and 1970, Weizsäcker served as president of the German Evangelical Church Assembly. He was also a member of the Synod and the Council of the Protestant Church in Germany from 1967 to 1984. During his early tenure as president, he wrote a newspaper article supporting a memorandum written by German evangelical intellectuals including Werner Heisenberg and his brother Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker who had spoken out in favour of accepting the Oder–Neisse line as the western border of Poland as an indispensable precondition for lasting peace in Europe. While this was met by negative reactions from politicians, especially in Weizsäcker&#x27;s own party, he nevertheless led the Evangelical Church on a way to promoting reconciliation with Poland, leading to a memorandum by the Church in both West and East Germany. The paper was widely discussed and met with a significantly more positive response.

== Political career ==

Weizsäcker joined the CDU in 1954. Some years later, Helmut Kohl offered him a safe seat for the 1965 elections, even going so far as to have Chancellor Konrad Adenauer write two letters urging him to run, but Weizsäcker declined, due to his work in the German Evangelical Church Assembly, wanting to avoid a conflict of interest. However, he became a member of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; (Federal Diet) in the 1969 federal elections, serving until 1981.

In 1974, Weizsäcker was the Presidential candidate of his party for the first time, but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP, who was supported by the ruling center-left coalition. Ahead of the 1976 elections, CDU chairman Helmut Kohl included him in his shadow cabinet for the party&#x27;s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor. Between 1979 and 1981, Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag.

=== Governing Mayor of West Berlin (1981–84) ===

Weizsäcker served as the Governing Mayor (&quot;Regierender Bürgermeister&quot;) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, he tried to keep alive the idea of Germany as a cultural nation, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city&#x27;s occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.

From 1981 to 1983, Weizsäcker headed a minority government in West Berlin, after the CDU had only won 48 percent of seats in the state assembly. His government was tolerated by the Free Democratic Party, who were in a coalition with the Social Democrats at the federal level at the time. After Helmut Kohl had won the federal election in 1983 and had formed a government with the Free Democrats, Weizsäcker did the same in West Berlin.

=== President of the Federal Republic of Germany (1984–94) ===

In 1984, Weizsäcker was elected as President of West Germany by the German Federal Convention, succeeding Karl Carstens and drawing unusual support from both the governing center-right coalition and the opposition Social Democratic Party; he defeated the Green party candidate, Luise Rinser.

==== First term (1984–89) ====

Richard von Weizsäcker took office as president on 1 July 1984. In his inaugural address, he appealed to his nation&#x27;s special consciousness, saying: &quot;Our situation, which differs from that of most other nations, is no reason to deny ourselves a national consciousness. To do so would be unhealthy for ourselves and eerie to our neighbors.&quot; He dedicated his first years in office mainly to foreign policy, travelling widely with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and choosing former Foreign Office employees as his personal advisors.

===== Speech on the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II =====

Weizsäcker, who was known as a great speaker, delivered his most famous speech in 1985, marking the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe on 8 May 1945. This came at a difficult time in West German politics. The country was caught up in a debate about whether Holocaust denial should be criminalized. At the same time, chancellor Helmut Kohl had accepted an invitation to visit a congress of the Silesian association of expellees which was to take place under the slogan &quot;Silesia is ours!&quot; (&quot;Schlesien ist unser!&quot;). This seemed to contradict the official position of the federal diet and government so that Kohl needed to lobby for the intended slogan to be changed.

It was originally planned that United States President Ronald Reagan should take part in the Second World War memorial event in the Bundestag, shifting the emphasis from remembering the past to highlighting West Germany in its partnership with the Western Bloc. On Weizsäcker&#x27;s strong urging, the occasion was marked without Reagan, who visited West Germany several days earlier instead, surrounding the G7–summit in Bonn. Reagan&#x27;s visit nevertheless sparked controversy, especially in the United States. In an attempt to reproduce the gesture made by Kohl and French President François Mitterrand a year earlier at Verdun, where they held hands in a symbolic moment, the chancellor and Reagan were set to visit the military cemetery in Bitburg. This raised objections, since the cemetery included the last resting place for several members of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

It was in this climate that Weizsäcker addressed parliament on 8 May 1985. Here, he articulated the historic responsibility of Germany and Germans for the crimes of Nazism. In contrast to the way the end of the war was still perceived by a majority of people in Germany at the time, he defined 8 May as a &quot;day of liberation&quot;. Weizsäcker pointed out the inseparable link between the Nazi takeover of Germany and the tragedies caused by the Second World War. In a passage of striking boldness, he took issue with one of the most cherished defenses of older Germans. &quot;When the unspeakable truth of the Holocaust became known at the end of the war,&quot; he said, &quot;all too many of us claimed they had not known anything about it or even suspected anything.&quot;

Most notably, Weizsäcker spoke of the danger of forgetting and distorting the past. &quot;There is no such thing as the guilt or innocence of an entire nation. Guilt is, like innocence, not collective but personal. There is discovered or concealed individual guilt. There is guilt which people acknowledge or deny. [...] All of us, whether guilty or not, whether young or old, must accept the past. We are all affected by the consequences and liable for it. [...] We Germans must look truth straight in the eye – without embellishment and without distortion. [...] There can be no reconciliation without remembrance.&quot;

Weizsäcker declared that younger generations of Germans &quot;cannot profess a guilt of their own for crimes they did not commit.&quot; With his speech, Weizsäcker was also one of the first representatives of Germany to remember the homosexual victims of Nazism as a &quot;victim group.&quot; This was also the case with his recognition of the Sinti and Roma as another victim group, a fact that was highlighted by the long-time head of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, Romani Rose.

Weizsäcker&#x27;s speech was praised both nationally and internationally. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;sober message of hope to the uneasy generations of young West Germans&quot;. The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Werner Nachmann, thanked Weizsäcker for his strong words, as did Karl Ibach, a former member of the German Resistance, who called his speech a &quot;moment of glory (&quot;Sternstunde&quot;) of our republic&quot;. Weizsäcker was however criticized for some of his remarks by members of his own party. Lorenz Niegel, a politician of the sister party CSU, who had not taken part in the ceremony, objected to the term &quot;day of liberation&quot;, referring to it instead as a &quot;day of deepest humiliation&quot;. The Greens were also absent during the speech, choosing instead to visit Auschwitz. A year later, the Green politician Petra Kelly called the speech &quot;correct, but not more than self-evident&quot;, pointing to speeches president Gustav Heinemann had made during his presidency. The harshest criticism came from the Federation of Expellees, whose president Herbert Czaja, while thanking the president for highlighting the expellees&#x27; fate, criticized his remark that &quot;conflicting legal claims must be subordinated under the imperative of reconciliation&quot;.

The speech was later released on vinyl and sold around 60,000 copies. Two million printed copies of its text were distributed globally, translated into thirteen languages, with 40,000 being sold in Japan alone. This does not include copies of the speech printed in newspapers, such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which reproduced it in full.

===== Role in the historians&#x27; dispute =====

Speaking to a congress of West German historians in Bamberg on 12 October 1988, Weizsäcker rejected the alleged attempts by some historians to compare the systematic murder of Jews in Nazi Germany to mass killings elsewhere – such as Stalin&#x27;s purges – or to seek external explanations for it. Thereby he declared an end to the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot; (&#x27;historians&#x27; dispute&#x27;) that had sharply divided German scholars and journalists for two years, stating &quot;Auschwitz remains unique. It was perpetrated by Germans in the name of Germany. This truth is immutable and will not be forgotten.&quot;

In his remarks to the historians, Weizsäcker said their dispute had prompted accusations that they sought to raise a &quot;multitude of comparisons and parallels&quot; that would cause &quot;the dark chapter of our own history to disappear, to be reduced to a mere episode.&quot; Andreas Hillgruber, a historian at Cologne University, whose 1986 book in which he linked the collapse of the eastern front and the Holocaust was one of the subjects of the dispute, declared himself in full agreement with Weizsäcker, insisting that he had never tried to &quot;relativize&quot; the past.

==== Second term (1989–94) ====

Unification of Germany


Because of the high esteem in which he was held by Germany&#x27;s political establishment and in the population, Weizsäcker is so far the only candidate to have stood for elections for the office of President unopposed; he was elected in that way to a second term of office on 23 May 1989.

Weizsäcker took office for his second presidential term on 1 July 1989, and in the course of it he oversaw the end of the Cold War and the Reunification of Germany. Thereupon, Weizsäcker became the first all-German Head of State since Karl Dönitz in May 1945. At midnight on 3 October 1990, during the official festivities held before the Reichstag building in Berlin to mark the moment of the reunification of Germany, President Weizsäcker delivered the only speech of the night, immediately after the raising of the flag, and before the playing of the National Anthem. His brief remarks, however, were almost inaudible, due to the sound of the bells marking midnight, and of the fireworks that were released to celebrate the moment of reunification. In those remarks he praised the accomplishment of German unity in freedom and in peace. He gave a longer speech at the act of state at the Berliner Philharmonie later that day.

===== President of a unified Germany =====

In 1990, Weizsäcker became the first head of state of the German Federal Republic to visit Poland. During his four-day visit, he reassured Poles that the newly unified German state would treat their western and northern borders, which included prewar German lands, as inviolable.

In 1992, Weizsäcker gave the eulogy at the state funeral of former Chancellor Willy Brandt at the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, the first state funeral for a former chancellor to take place in Berlin since the death of Gustav Stresemann in 1929. The funeral was attended by an array of leading European political figures, including French President François Mitterrand, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Weizsäcker stretched the traditionally ceremonial position of Germany&#x27;s president to reach across political, national, and age boundaries to address a wide range of controversial issues. He is credited with being largely responsible for taking the lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo-Nazis in Mölln, in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993. He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo-Nazi attacks in Mölln and Solingen. The services were snubbed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who dismayed many Germans by saying it was not necessary for the government to send a representative.

In March 1994, Weizsäcker attended the Frankfurt premiere of the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; along with the Israeli ambassador, Avi Primor, and the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis.

During the debate over the change of the seat of the German government from Bonn to Berlin, the president spoke out in favor of Berlin. In a memorandum released in February 1991, he declared that he would not act as a mere &quot;decoration of a so-called capital&quot;, urging the diet to move more constitutional organs to Berlin. To compensate for a delay in the transfer to Berlin of the government and the federal parliament, Weizsäcker declared in April 1993 that he would be performing an increased share of his duties in Berlin. He decided not to wait for the renovation and conversion as the presidential seat of the Kronprinzenpalais (Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace) at Berlin&#x27;s Unter den Linden boulevard, and to use instead his existing official residence in West Berlin, the Bellevue Palace beyond Tiergarten park.

===== Critique of party politics =====

In an interview book released in 1992, midway through his second term, Weizsäcker voiced a harsh critique of the leading political parties in Germany, claiming that they took a larger role in public life than was awarded to them by the constitution. He criticized the high number of career politicians (&quot;Berufspolitiker&quot;), who &quot;in general are neither expert nor dilettante, but generalists with particular knowledge only in political battle&quot;. The immediate reactions toward this interview were mixed. Prominent party politicians such as Rainer Barzel and Johannes Rau criticized the remarks, as did Minister of Labour Norbert Blüm, who asked the president to show more respect towards the work done by party members. Former chancellor Helmut Schmidt, on the other hand, conceded that Weizsäcker was &quot;essentially right&quot;. While comments from politicians were mainly negative, a public poll conducted by the &quot;Wickert-Institut&quot; in June 1992 showed that 87.4 percent of the population agreed with the president. Political commentators generally interpreted the remarks as a hidden attack on the incumbent chancellor Helmut Kohl, since Weizsäcker&#x27;s relationship with his former patron had cooled over the years. In a column for the German newspaper &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, chief-editor Rudolf Augstein criticized the president for his attack, writing: &quot;You cannot have it both ways: on the one hand giving a right and seminal political incentive, but on the other hand insulting the governing class and its chief&quot;.

===== Travels =====

On his trip to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The president was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up to shake his hand were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir&#x27;s Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker&#x27;s visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.

In 1987, he travelled to Moscow to meet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in what was perceived as a difficult time in West German-Soviet relations, after chancellor Kohl had angered Moscow by comparing Gorbachev to Joseph Goebbels. During a speech at the Kremlin, Weizsäcker said: &quot;The Germans, who today live separated into East and West, have never stopped and will never stop to feel like one nation.&quot; His speech was, however, censored in the official Communist Party newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;. However, when German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher protested against this to his Soviet counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze, the speech was then printed unabridged in the lesser paper &quot;Izvestia&quot;. Weizsäcker also appealed to the Soviet authorities to agree to a pardon for the last inmate in the Spandau Prison, former Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess. This proved unsuccessful, and Hess committed suicide six weeks later. The visit was nevertheless considered a success, as Gorbachev was quoted afterwards saying that &quot;a new page of history was opened&quot;, after the two had discussed matters of disarmament. Also in 1987, Erich Honecker became the first East German leader to visit the Federal Republic. While state guests in Germany are usually welcomed by the President, Honecker was still not greeted officially by Weizsäcker, but by chancellor Kohl, since the Federal Republic did not consider the GDR a foreign state. Weizsäcker did however receive Honecker later at his seat of office, the Hammerschmidt Villa.

== Post-presidency ==

As an elder statesman, Weizsäcker long remained involved in politics and charitable affairs in Germany after his retirement as president. He chaired a commission established by the Social Democratic-Green government of the day for reforming the Bundeswehr. Along with Henry Kissinger, in 1994 he supported Richard Holbrooke in creating the American Academy in Berlin. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the Robert Bosch Stiftung.

Weizsäcker served as a member of the Advisory Council of Transparency International. In a letter addressed to Nigeria&#x27;s military ruler Sani Abacha in 1996, he called for the immediate release of General Olusegun Obasanjo, the former head of state of Nigeria, who had become the first military ruler in Africa to keep his promise to hand over power to an elected civilian government but was later sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.

Weizsäcker also served on many international committees. He was chairman of the Independent Working Group on the future of the United Nations and was one of three &quot;Wise Men&quot; appointed by European Commission President Romano Prodi to consider the future of the European Union. From 2003 until his death, he was a member of the Advisory Commission on the return of cultural property seized as a result of Nazi persecution, especially Jewish property, led by the former head of the Federal Constitutional Court, Jutta Limbach. In November 2014, Weizsäcker retired as chairman of the Bergedorf Round Table, a discussion forum on foreign policy issues.

=== Death and funeral ===

Weizsäcker died in Berlin on 31 January 2015, aged 94. He was survived by his wife, Marianne, and three of their four children. Upon his death, there was general praise for his life and political career. In its obituary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Weizsäcker &quot;a guardian of his nation&#x27;s moral conscience&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that Germany was &quot;uniquely fortunate&quot; in having had him as a leader.

He was honored with a state funeral on 11 February 2015 at Berlin Cathedral. Eulogies were given by incumbent president Joachim Gauck, foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) and former vice president of the Bundestag Antje Vollmer (Green Party). Steinmeier praised Weizsäcker&#x27;s role in foreign relations, where he had worked towards reconciliation with France and Poland and supported a dialogue with the communist regimes in the East, often against his own party. The funeral was attended by many serving high-ranking politicians in Germany, including chancellor Angela Merkel. Also in attendance were former presidents Roman Herzog, Horst Köhler, and Christian Wulff, as well as former chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schröder. Princess Beatrix, former Queen of the Netherlands, was also present, as was former Polish president Lech Wałęsa. After the ceremony, soldiers stood to attention as Weizsäcker&#x27;s coffin was brought to its resting place at Waldfriedhof Dahlem. In the subsequent days, many Berliners visited Weizsäcker&#x27;s grave to pay tribute and lay down flowers. On 15 April 2020, von Weizsäcker&#x27;s 100th birthday, incumbent Governing Mayor of Berlin Michael Müller and Ralf Wieland, president of the Abgeordnetenhaus, Berlin&#x27;s state parliament, laid down a wreath at his grave in honour of his services to the city of Berlin.

== Relationship with his party and Helmut Kohl ==

Weizsäcker, who had joined the CDU in 1954, was known for often publicly voicing political views different from his own party line, both in and out of the presidential office. While he was himself sceptical of Willy Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;, he urged his party not to block it entirely in the lower house, the Bundestag, since rejection would be met with dismay abroad. When the CDU gained a sweeping victory in the state elections in Baden-Württemberg in April 1972, his party decided to take the opportunity to dispose of chancellor Brandt with a vote of no confidence, replacing him with Rainer Barzel, and Weizsäcker was one of only three elect CDU politicians to speak out against the proposal. He maintained an easy-going and open demeanor towards members of all other parties. In 1987, at a time when the CDU actively tried to label the Green Party as unconstitutional, the President had regular contact with high-ranking Green politicians such as Antje Vollmer, who was also active in the Protestant Church in Germany, and Joschka Fischer, who said that with his understanding of state &quot;he [Weizsäcker] is closer to the Green Party than to Kohl, not NATO, but Auschwitz as reason of state (&quot;Staatsräson&quot;).&quot;

Helmut Kohl, who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1982 to 1998, was an early patron of Weizsäcker&#x27;s, effectively helping him into parliament. However, their relationship took a first strain in 1971, when Weizsäcker supported Rainer Barzel over Kohl for the CDU-chairmanship. Subsequently, Kohl unsuccessfully tried to deny Weizsäcker the chance to become president in 1983. After he had taken office, Weizsäcker criticized Kohl&#x27;s government on numerous occasions, taking liberties not previously heard of from someone in a ceremonial role such as his. For instance, he urged the chancellor to recognize the Oder–Neisse line and spoke out for a more patient approach to the journey towards German reunification. Other examples include the aforementioned speech in 1985 and his critique of party politics in 1992. Following a critical interview Weizsäcker gave to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine in September 1997, Kohl reacted during a meeting of his parliamentary group by saying that Weizsäcker (whom he called &quot;that gentleman&quot;) was no longer &quot;one of us&quot;. This was followed by CDU spokesman Rolf Kiefer stating that the CDU had removed Weizsäcker from its membership database, since the former president had not paid his membership fees in a long time. Weizsäcker then took the matter to the party&#x27;s arbitrating body and won. The tribunal ruled that he was allowed to let his membership rest indefinitely. After his death, &quot;Spiegel&quot; editor Gerhard Spörl called Weizsäcker the &quot;intellectual alternative medicine to Kohl&quot;.

After his presidency came to an end, Weizsäcker remained vocal in daily politics, e.g. speaking for a more liberal immigration policy, calling the way his party handled it &quot;simply ridiculous&quot;. He also spoke out in favour of dual citizenship and a change of German citizenship law from &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; to &quot;jus soli&quot;, a view not generally shared by his party colleagues. Towards the former East-German leading party, the PDS (today called &quot;Die Linke&quot;), Weizsäcker urged his party colleagues to enter into a serious political discussion. He went as far as speaking in favor of a coalition government between Social Democrats and the PDS in Berlin after the 2001 state election.

== Publications ==

Weizsäcker&#x27;s publications include &quot;Die deutsche Geschichte geht weiter&quot; (&quot;German History Continues&quot;), first published in 1983; &quot;Von Deutschland aus&quot; &quot;(From Germany Abroad)&quot;, a collection of speeches first published in 1985; &quot;Von Deutschland nach Europa&quot; (&quot;From Germany to Europe&quot;, 1991) and his memoirs &quot;Vier Zeiten&quot; (&quot;Four Times&quot;), published in German in 1997 and in English as &quot;From Weimar to the Wall: My Life in German Politics&quot; in 1999. In a review in &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, Friedrich Karl Fromme wrote that the memoirs tell nothing new about the times he lived in, but &quot;something about the person&quot;. In 2009, he published a book on his recollections of German reunification, titled &quot;Der Weg zur Einheit&quot; (&quot;The Path to Unity&quot;). German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; dismissed the book as &quot;boring&quot;, accusing the account of being too balanced.

== Other activities and recognition ==

Weizsäcker received many honors in his career, including honorary membership in the Order of Saint John; an honorary doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1993; creation of the Richard von Weizsäcker Professorship at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of Johns Hopkins University and the Robert Bosch Foundation of Stuttgart in 2003; and more than eleven other honorary doctorates, ranging from the Weizmann Institute in Israel to Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard universities, the Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Law (1995) at Uppsala University and the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, the Leo Baeck Prize from the Central Council of Jews in Germany, and the Buber-Rosenzweig Medallion from the Society for Christian-Jewish Cooperation. After his death, deputy director of Poland&#x27;s international broadcaster, Rafal Kiepuszewski, called Weizsäcker &quot;the greatest German friend Poland has ever had&quot;.

Both Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck praised Weizsäcker, with the latter declaring upon the news of his death: &quot;We are losing a great man and an outstanding head of state.&quot; French president François Hollande highlighted Weizsäcker&#x27;s &quot;moral stature.&quot;

<doc id="338923" wikidata="Q1470087" url="?curid=338923" title="DéFI">
<text>DéFI (; a backronym of Démocrate fédéraliste indépendant ) is a social-liberal and regionalist political party in Belgium mainly known for defending French-speakers&#x27; interests in and near the Brussels region. Founded in 1964, the party is led by Sophie Rohonyi, a former member of the Chamber of Representatives. The party&#x27;s current name, &quot;DéFI&quot; or &quot;Défi&quot;, was adopted in 2016 and is a backronym of &quot;Démocrate, Fédéraliste, Indépendant&quot; (literally, &quot;Democratic, Federalist, Independent&quot;) meaning &quot;challenge&quot; in French.

==History==
The party was founded as the Democratic Front of Francophones (&quot;Front Démocratique des Francophones&quot;, FDF) on 11 May 1964 as a response to the language laws of 1962. The party had instant success in Brussels: it first contested parliamentary elections one year later, where it won one senator and 3 seats in the Chamber of Representatives for the constituency of Brussels. Its number of seats increased further in the subsequent parliamentary elections. The party also dominated Brussels&#x27; municipal politics until 1982.

Initially the party cooperated with the Walloon Rally. From 1977 until 1980, the FDF participated in the federal governments led by Leo Tindemans and subsequently Wilfried Martens. From 1992, the FDF regularly competed in electoral alliance with the larger Liberal Reformist Party (PRL). In 2002 the PRL, the FDF, the MCC and the PFF formed the Reformist Movement (MR), a closer alliance of Francophone liberal parties.

In January 2010 the party name was amended to Francophone Democratic Federalists (&quot;Fédéralistes Démocrates Francophones&quot;), maintaining its original acronym. In September 2011, the FDF decided to leave the alliance over disagreements with MR president Charles Michel on the agreement concerning the splitting of the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde district during the 2010–2011 Belgian government formation.

The party adopted its current name, DéFI, in November 2015.

==Policies==
The party advocates the extension of the bilingual status of Brussels to some municipalities in the Brussels Periphery (in Flemish Brabant, Flemish Region), where a majority of the population is French-speaking, but the official language is Dutch, and pushes for the rights of French-speakers in Flemish municipalities to use French instead of Dutch in dealing with Dutch-speaking officials. Both stances are opposed by Flemish parties, who say that French-speaking residents of the Flemish Region should learn Dutch and argue that the Francization of Brussels should not further itself into the Region.

<doc id="338926" wikidata="Q581369" url="?curid=338926" title="Bonkers (American TV series)">
<text>Bonkers is an American animated television series and a spin-off short series called He&#x27;s Bonkers which mainly aired in &quot;Raw Toonage&quot;. The show originally aired from September 4, 1993 to February 23, 1994 after a preview of the series aired on The Disney Channel from February 28 to June 6, 1993. The 9 episodes of the Disney Channel preview aired in October 1993 in the original syndication. The original syndicated run was available as part of the programming block The Disney Afternoon. Reruns of the show continued in syndication until 1996 and were later shown on Toon Disney until late 2004.

==Premise==
Bonkers D. Bobcat, a formerly popular cartoon star, had washed out of show business and became a cop. He was made the junior partner of Detective Lucky Piquel in the Los Angeles Police Department, a grim and ill-tempered human who hates toons. Throughout the series, the pair work together to solve crimes in the Hollywood, Los Angeles, California region. Bonkers repeatedly tried to win Piquel&#x27;s praise, but usually just ended up ruining missions with his goofy antics, which would often prove to save the day. 

After working with Bonkers for several episodes, Piquel was given an FBI job in Washington, D.C., and was initially happy at finally being able to leave Bonkers, but finally realized that after all the time spent hating working with Bonkers he had grown to love him. He took along the police radio, the light, Toots and Fall-Apart Rabbit. At the end of the first &quot;Lucky&quot; episodes, Bonkers was given a second partner, the attractive cool-headed Officer Miranda Wright. Although also human, she was far more patient and tolerant of his antics than was Piquel. With Miranda, Bonkers was more the brunt of the slapstick.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Bonkers D. Bobcat===

Bonkers D. Bobcat (voiced by Jim Cummings) is an overly energetic and hyperactive cartoon anthropomorphic bobcat that works in the Toon Division of the Hollywood PD and was once a big name cartoon star from the &quot;He’s Bonkers&quot; shorts (&quot;Raw Toonage&quot;) for Wackytoons Studios. He was fired due to his show being bumped out of first place in the ratings. He was introduced to law enforcement when he unknowingly saved cartoon celebrity Donald Duck from a park mugger (mostly due to the help of officer Lucky Piquel) and was given full credit for the mugger&#x27;s capture.

For his actions, he received the Citizen of Valor award by the Chief of Police, Leonard Kanifky. Bonkers, while soaking in the praise, told the chief about how his experiences starring in police cartoons helped in the capture of the mugger. Chief Kanifky mistook his fictional roles as real life, worldwide police accounts and, thinking that Bonkers would be a benefit to the police force, asked if the former cartoon star would like a job working for the Hollywood PD, which Bonkers accepted because of his recent unemployment from Wackytoons Studios. Bonkers then requested Lucky as his partner, and the two established the beginning of the Toon Division. When Bonkers first came home to Lucky&#x27;s house, he was treated as a sort of adopted son to Lucky.

Although Bonkers means well, he usually messes up cases for his fellow officers due to his lack of experience in law enforcement and his wild, exaggerated, cartoony nature. He even tells Lucky at one point that he is not good at logical police thinking because he is a toon. Not only does Bonkers make a design change between the &#x27;Lucky&#x27; and &#x27;Miranda&#x27; episodes, his personality is slightly tweaked as well. Despite being a police officer, Bonkers is unarmed. However, he still carries a badge. He&#x27;s portrayed as a rather clumsy, somewhat foolish character who ends up being the show&#x27;s punching bag or as a less of a buffoon and more of an Inspector Clouseau-type, in control of himself (though still hyperactive), and carries an extensive knowledge about the toon and their behavior, which is an asset on cases dealing with rogue toons (Lucky would very rarely acknowledge this, although he knows it deep inside). The joke is his lack of law enforcement experience and procedure is still his &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot;.

===Supporting characters===
*Fall Apart Rabbit (voiced by Frank Welker) is Bonkers&#x27; clumsy best friend and stunt-double back during Bonkers&#x27; Hollywood days, appearing only in the &quot;Lucky Episodes.&quot; He literally falls apart at the drop of a hat and must wear bandages over various body parts to keep himself from dismantling. He is often remarkably stupid and goofy, even for a cartoon character.
*Fawn Deer (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is Bonkers&#x27; main love interest and co-star when he was a cartoon star. Bonkers is willing to do just about anything to please and impress her. Fortunately for Bonkers, Fawn clearly reciprocates his obvious love for her, as she has proven it on numerous occasions by kissing him on the cheek, and sometimes on the lips.

====Piquel family====
*Detective Lucky Shirley Piquel (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a police detective and Bonkers&#x27; main partner. He is a slovenly, fat, streetwise mustachioed man. He is balding, but wears a toupée. Lucky is a serious, hard-boiled detective whose by-the-book nature is at odds with Bonkers&#x27; decidedly more maniacal approach to crime solving. Chief Kanifky usually mistakes his last name for &quot;Pickle&quot;. In the first several episodes in which he appeared, he defeated the villain by falling on them or otherwise crushing them beneath his massive girth. Although he often was able to get to the core of the cartoon universe by finally embracing it, with Bonkers&#x27; help. Will prove increasingly good and less comfortable against an annoying toon, in each case of the cartoons. He is the father of Marilyn and husband to Dilandra or who he normally calls &quot;Dil&quot; or &quot;Dyl&quot;. It was revealed in &quot;Once in a Blue Toon&quot; that his middle name is Shirley, and that he has a 53-inch waistline. He drives a rather torn-down patrol car through the series.
*Marilyn Piquel (voiced by Sherry Lynn) is Lucky&#x27;s child genius daughter. She is an aspiring artist as well as a script/story writer and has deep connection to toons such as Bonkers, with her favorite toon being TV star Skunky Skunk. She is more than capable of taking care of herself and aids her father in a number of his cases often being the words of wisdom or a source of knowledge to Lucky. Although looking like her mom Dilandra &quot;Dil&quot;/&quot;Dyl&quot; (aside from her big round glasses and freckled face), she also shares her father&#x27;s hair color.
*Dilandra &quot;Dyl&quot; Piquel (voiced by April Winchell) is Lucky&#x27;s understanding wife who supports her husband and at times encourages their daughter Marilyn.

====Wright family====
*Officer Miranda Wright (voiced by Karla DeVito) is a police officer that works at the same police station as Lucky. She is Bonkers&#x27; second partner. Her name is a play on Miranda rights, an American system in which people under arrest get certain rights, she&#x27;s the opposite of Lucky and Sgt. Grating when it comes to toons and their antics as she likes/loves them especially her friend and partner Bonkers as she cool headedly tolerates his antics and stands up for him against their own boss, While she may have somewhat of a personal limit to Bonkers&#x27; sporadic behavior at times, it doesn&#x27;t really seem to annoy her, She even seems amused at times, but nonetheless they still truly care and stand up for each other as friends and partners. 
*Shirley Wright (voiced by Erin Gray) is a news reporter, Miranda&#x27;s older sister, and apparently Timmy&#x27;s mother.
*Timmy Wright (voiced by Dana Hill) is the troublesome nephew of Miranda Wright, who Bonkers babysits.

====Los Angeles Police Department officers ====
*Leonard Kanifky (voiced by Earl Boen) is the absent-minded chief of police, and is the boss of Bonkers and Lucky. He also appears in some of the &quot;Miranda Wright&quot; era episodes where he still commands Bonkers and Miranda herself. He has the tendency to ramble on and trail off, as if senile. He constantly mispronounces Lucky&#x27;s last name &quot;Pickle&quot;.
*Sergeant Francis Q. Grating (voiced by Ron Perlman) is a police sergeant and, the boss of Bonkers and Miranda. A running gag is that Grating is almost driven insane by Bonkers. Like Lucky, he hates toons too. However, in &quot;Cartoon Cornered&quot;, he befriended Bonkers&#x27; clock after their adventures in Wacky Toons Studio. In &quot;Dog Day AfterToon&quot; he shows some respect to Bonkers after he is saved from the bank hold-up; albeit reluctantly.

====Recurring civilian characters====
*Jitters A. Dog (voiced by Jeff Bennett) – a small, nervous dog who is Bonkers&#x27;s friend and one of his sidekicks. His role in the series was of the straight man, constantly having serious bodily harm done to him through Bonkers&#x27; recklessness (and occasionally others) his catchphrase is; &quot;I hate my life&quot;. Despite his mostly negative luck, He is still Bonkers&#x27; best friend, though Jitters himself might disagree.

==Production==
The series played 65 episodes, as part of &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;. They were not created in chronological order: The &quot;Miranda&quot; episodes were actually produced first. This discrepancy becomes evident when observing the look of the main character in both sets of episodes. In the &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot; shorts, Bonkers was orange with one brown spot, golf-club-like ears, and an undone tail. When the Lucky Piquel-era episodes (produced by Robert Taylor) were made, the character had a major overhaul: skinnier ears, two black spots on each his tufts, black Tigger-like stripes on his tail, and a different uniform. In the Miranda Wright-era episodes (produced by Duane Capizzi, Robert Hathcock &amp; Greg Weisman) Bonkers&#x27; look is similar to the one in &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot;. Actually it is considered as a mixture of &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot; look and the &quot;Lucky&quot; episodes look. The series occasionally featured special extra compilation episodes of &quot;cartoons&quot; from Bonkers&#x27;s pre-police actor days, all lifted from the &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot;/&quot;Raw Toonage&quot; series. The two-part premiere can be seen to show the reason for the difference in appearance as he mostly appears with his Black Dot Lucky design, but when he goes into makeup, his sweater is put on, and when his head re-appears, his spots have turned brown, then his ears are &#x27;puffed&#x27; up. While this works for explaining the two designs in context, &quot;New Partners on the Block&quot; does not show or explain why he then decided to use a somewhat &#x27;make up&#x27;-like version for every day.

The &quot;Raw Toonage&quot; shorts were an after-thought of production. While &quot;Bonkers&quot; was in pre-production, the &quot;Raw Toonage&quot; team headed by Larry Latham produced 12 &quot;He&#x27;s Bonkers&quot; shorts. These shorts were, in the context of &quot;Bonkers&quot;, explained to be some of the shorts Bonkers made at Wackytoons Studios before he was fired. The first short entitled &quot;Petal to the Metal&quot; was originally shown in theaters in 1992 before the feature movie &quot;3 Ninjas&quot;, while the rest were shown on the program &quot;Raw Toonage&quot;. In syndication, the shorts were collected into four full extra episodes with fillers of new material in between.

Meanwhile, Duane Capizzi, making his producing debut, was brought into the fold and teamed with animation veteran Robert Hathcock and charged with making 65 episodes (a full season&#x27;s worth in syndication). The episodes theoretically would feature Bonkers with Wright as his partner. These episodes came back from overseas animation studios looking less than spectacular, causing considerable concern at Disney. Ultimately, the original team was replaced, and a team headed by Robert Taylor came in. Only 19 of the original-order shows survived to air; they are what is known as the &quot;Miranda Wright episodes&quot; of &quot;Bonkers&quot; or simply as the &quot;Miranda&quot; episodes. Nine of these episodes were aired on The Disney Channel during the first half of 1993 as a preview for the series, before its syndicated premiere in the fall. The 19 &quot;Miranda Wright&quot; episodes are shown in October 1993 in the broadcast syndication. Greg Weisman (co-creator of &quot;Disney&#x27;s Gargoyles&quot;) worked on the Miranda episodes, and Bonkers&#x27;s relationship with Miranda inspired Goliath&#x27;s relationship with Elisa Maza.

Taylor threw out the old premise of the show. He replaced it with the Lucky Piquel scenario, but his episodes were revised and established to occur before the original episodes. 42 episodes of the &quot;Lucky Piquel Era&quot; were made, including one (&quot;New Partners on the Block&quot;), which attempted to bridge the gap between the two somewhat contradictory storylines.

The series was long incorrectly rumored to have originally been intended as a &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; spin-off series which ended up being scrapped due to licensing issues from Amblin Entertainment, with &quot;Bonkers&quot; being created instead. However, in 2008, Greg Weisman, who was a writer on the series, denied this. While confirming that the title character was inspired by Roger, and the Toontown concept had also been influenced by the film, Weisman insists that Bonkers was always meant to be his own character.

The syndicated version of the series (which omits several of the original episodes that survived first-run) was last seen on Toon Disney until late 2004.

The series became available to stream on Disney+, upon its launch on November 12, 2019.

===New Partners on the Block===
&quot;New Partners on the Block&quot; was the &quot;Lucky&quot; episode that proceeded the 19 &quot;Miranda&quot; episodes and a transition episode that showed how Bonkers went from having Lucky Piquel as a partner to having Miranda Wright as his newest partner. The episode was much like the pilot episode/movie &quot;Going Bonkers&quot;, using the CGI rain and bringing back the characters that were associated with Bonkers, those characters being Fawn Deer, Jitters A. Dog, and Grumbles Grizzly and, unlike the pilot, had more speaking and screen time.

At the end of the episode, Bonkers, along with Miranda and Lucky, capture the main villain, bomber Fireball Frank and rescue FBI agent Tolson in the process, making Bonkers and Miranda a team and giving Lucky a job as an FBI agent in Washington, D.C. Piquel. His family Dyl (wife) and Marilyn (daughter), Fall-Apart Rabbit, Toots and Brodrick the toon radio all subsequently relocated to Washington, D.C., allowing them to be written out of the show.

This episode was removed from rotation in the United States after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing due to its bombing/terrorism plot, and was consequently never rerun on Toon Disney, even before Disney&#x27;s stricter censorship policies following the September 11 attacks. Another 3 episodes, &quot;Fall Apart Bomb Squad&quot;, &quot;Witless for the Prosecution&quot;, and &quot;The Stork Exchange&quot;, were also never shown on Toon Disney for similar reasons. However, three of those episodes have been rerun in Europe (especially in Italy). In addition, those three episodes are available to stream on Disney+.

==Home media==
&quot;Bonkers&quot; was released on three VHS tapes and Betamax tapes in 1994 by Walt Disney Home Video, each containing no more than two episodes. They include the following:

*&quot;Aladdin&quot; (1994–1995): In the episode &quot;Snowman is an Island&quot;, the Genie was transformed into Bonkers.
*&quot;Goosebumps&quot; referenced the show in &quot;Piano Lessons Can Be Murder&quot;, the 13th book of the original series.

The second is during the end credits on a billboard for &quot;Disney Afternoon Fist Fight&quot; alongside other DA toons, and he&#x27;s back to his old self.

==Video games==
The series inspired three video games. The first, titled &quot;Bonkers&quot;, is a platform game by Capcom, released for the Super NES in October 1994. In the game, Bonkers must retrieve three items stolen from a museum.

An action game by Sega, also titled &quot;Bonkers&quot;, was released in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It consists of four mini-games in which Bonkers attempts to apprehend criminals from the series.

The third game, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Bonkers: Wax Up!&quot;, was published for the Game Gear in 1995, followed three years later by a Brazilian-only release on the Master System. In the game, Bonkers sets out to rescue Lucky and several toons who have been captured.

<text>The White Pass and Yukon Route (WP&amp;Y, WP&amp;YR) is a Canadian and U.S. Class III narrow-gauge railroad linking the port of Skagway, Alaska, with Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon. An isolated system, it has no direct connection to any other railroad. Equipment, freight and passengers are ferried by ship through the Port of Skagway, and via road through a few of the stops along its route.

The railroad began construction in 1898 during the Klondike Gold Rush as a means of reaching the gold fields. With its completion in 1900, it became the primary route to the interior of the Yukon, supplanting the Chilkoot Trail and other routes. The route continued operation until 1982, and in 1988 was partially revived as a heritage railway. In July 2018, the railway was purchased by Carnival Corporation &amp; plc.

For many years the railroad was a subsidiary of Tri White Corporation, also the parent of Clublink, and operated by the Pacific and Arctic Railway and Navigation Company (in Alaska), the British Columbia Yukon Railway Company (in British Columbia) and the British Yukon Railway Company, originally known as the British Yukon Mining, Trading and Transportation Company (in Yukon), which used the trade name White Pass and Yukon Route. The railroad was sold by Clublink to a joint venture controlled by Survey Point Holdings, with a minority holding by the Carnival Corporation &amp; plc parent company of the Carnival Cruise Line.

The railway was designated as an international historic civil engineering landmark by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering and the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1994.

==History==
===Construction===

The line was born of the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897. The most popular route taken by prospectors to the gold fields in Dawson City was a treacherous route from the port in Skagway or Dyea, Alaska, across the mountains to the Canada–US border at the summit of the Chilkoot Pass or the White Pass. There, the prospectors were not allowed across by Canadian authorities unless they had sufficient gear for the winter, typically one ton of supplies. This usually required several trips across the passes. There was a need for better transportation than pack horses used over the White Pass or human portage over the Chilkoot Pass. This need generated numerous railroad schemes. In 1897, the Canadian government received 32 proposals for Yukon railroads, and most were never realized.

In 1897, three separate companies were organized to build a rail link from Skagway to Fort Selkirk, Yukon, away. Largely financed by British investors organized by Close Brothers merchant bank, a railroad was soon under construction. A gauge was chosen by the railway contract builder Michael James Heney. The narrow roadbed required by narrow gauge greatly reduced costs when the roadbed was blasted in solid rock. Even so, 450 tons of explosives were used to reach White Pass summit. The narrow gauge also permitted tighter radii to be used on curves, making the task easier by allowing the railroad to follow the landscape more, rather than having to be blasted through it.

Construction started in May 1898, but they encountered obstacles in dealing with the Skagway city government and the town&#x27;s crime boss, Soapy Smith. The company president, Samuel H. Graves (1852–1911), was elected as chairman of the vigilante organization that was trying to expel Soapy and his gang of confidence men and rogues. On the evening of July 8, 1898, Soapy Smith was killed in the Shootout on Juneau Wharf with guards at one of the vigilante&#x27;s meetings. Samuel Graves witnessed the shooting. The railroad helped block off the escape routes of the gang, aiding in their capture, and the remaining difficulties in Skagway subsided.

On July 21, 1898, an excursion train hauled passengers for out of Skagway, the first train to operate in Alaska. On July 30, 1898, the charter rights and concessions of the three companies were acquired by the White Pass &amp; Yukon Railway Company Limited, a new company organized in London. Construction reached the summit of White Pass, away from Skagway, by mid-February 1899. The railway reached Bennett, British Columbia, on July 6, 1899. In the summer of 1899, construction started north from Carcross to Whitehorse, north of Skagway. The construction crews working from Bennett along a difficult lakeshore reached Carcross the next year, and the last spike was driven on July 29, 1900, with service starting on August 1, 1900. By then much of the Gold Rush fever had died down.

At the time, the gold spike was actually a regular iron spike. A gold spike was on hand, but the gold was too soft and instead of being driven, was just hammered out of shape.

===Early years===
As the gold rush wound down, serious professional mining was taking its place; not so much for gold as for other metals such as copper, silver and lead. The closest port was Skagway, and the only route there was via the White Pass &amp; Yukon Route&#x27;s river boats and railroad.

While ores and concentrates formed the bulk of the traffic, the railroad also carried passenger traffic, and other freight. There was, for a long time, no easier way into the Yukon Territory, and no other way into or out of Skagway except by sea.

Financing and route was in place to extend the rails from Whitehorse to Carmacks, but there was chaos in the river transportation service, resulting in a bottleneck. The White Pass instead used the money to purchase most of the riverboats, providing a steady and reliable transportation system between Whitehorse and Dawson City.

While the WP&amp;YR never built between Whitehorse and Fort Selkirk, some minor expansion of the railway occurred after 1900. In 1901, the Taku Tram, a portage railroad was built at Taku City, British Columbia, which was operated until 1951. It carried passengers and freight between the SS &quot;Tutshi&quot; operating on Tagish Lake and the MV &quot;Tarahne&quot; operating across Atlin Lake to Atlin, British Columbia (While &quot;Tutshi&quot; was destroyed by a suspicious fire around 1990, &quot;Tarahne&quot; was restored and hosts special dinners including murder mysteries. Lifeboats built for &quot;Tutshi&quot;&#x27;s restoration were donated to &quot;Tarahne&quot;). The Taku Tram could not turn around, and simply backed up on its westbound run. The locomotive used, the &quot;Duchess&quot;, is now in Carcross.

In 1910, the WP&amp;YR operated a branch line to Pueblo, a mining area near Whitehorse. This branch line was abandoned in 1918; a haul-road follows that course today but is mostly barricaded; a &quot;Whitehorse Star&quot; editorial in the 1980s noted that this route would be an ideal alignment if the Alaska Highway should ever require a bypass reroute around Whitehorse.

By June 1914, the WP&amp;YR had 11 locomotives, 15 passenger cars and 233 freight cars operating on of trackage; generating $68,368 in passenger revenue and $257,981 in freight revenue; still a profitable operation as operating expenses were only $100,347. While all other railroads in the Yukon (such as the Klondike Mines Railway at Dawson City) had been abandoned by 1914, the WP&amp;YR continued to operate.

During the Great Depression, traffic was sparse on the WP&amp;YR, and for a time trains operated as infrequently as once a week.

===World War II===
Alaska became strategically important for the United States during World War II; there was concern that the Japanese might invade it, as Alaska was the closest part of the United States to Japan. Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the decision was made by the US and Canadian governments to construct the Alaska Highway as an all-weather overland route to ensure communication. One of the principal staging points for construction was Whitehorse, which could be supplied by the WP&amp;YR.

By that time the railroad was a financially-starved remnant from Klondike gold rush days, with well-worn engines and rolling stock. Despite this, the railroad moved during the first 9 months of 1942, more than double its prewar annual traffic. Even this was deemed insufficient, so the U.S. Government leased the railroad for the duration, effective at 12:01 a.m. on 1 October 1942, handing control to the United States Army. What became the 770th Railway Operating Battalion of the Military Railway Service took over train operations in company with the WP&amp;Y&#x27;s civilian staff. Major John E. Ausland, a former executive with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, was named superintendent, while Lieutenant Stanley Jerome Gaetz was trainmaster.

Canadian law forbade foreign government agencies from operating within Canada and its territories, but Japanese forces had occupied some of the Aleutian Islands by this time, and an accommodation was quickly reached to &quot;make an illegal action legal.&quot;
The MRS scoured the US for usable narrow-gauge locomotives and rolling stock, and soon a strange and colorful assortment began arriving at Skagway. The single-largest group was seven D&amp;RGW K-28 class 2-8-2&#x27;s acquired prior to the lease, in August 1942, 2-8-0&#x27;s from the Silverton Northern and the Colorado &amp; Southern, all over 40 years old, and a pair of ET&amp;WNC 4-6-0&#x27;s soon appeared, among others, as well as eleven new War Department Class S118 2-8-2&#x27;s. WP&amp;Y&#x27;s original roster of 10 locomotives and 83 cars was soon eclipsed by the Army&#x27;s additional 26 engines and 258 cars.
The increase in traffic was remarkable: in the last 3 months of 1942, the railroad moved . In 1943, the line carried , equivalent to ten years&#x27; worth of typical prewar traffic: all this despite some of the most severe winter weather recorded since 1910; gales, snowdrifts and temperatures of succeeded in blockading the line from 5 to 15 February 1943 and from 27 January to 14 February 1944.
The peak movement occurred on August 4, 1943, when the White Pass moved 38 trains north and south, totaling (), and in 24 hours.

Control of the railroad was handed back to its civilian operators late in 1944.

===1946–1982===
In May, 1947, the railroad purchased its last steam locomotives. These were a pair of 2-8-2 Mikado type engines built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, numbered No. 72 and No. 73.

In 1951, the White Pass and Yukon Corporation Ltd., a new holding company, was incorporated to acquire the three railway companies comprising the WP&amp;YR from the White Pass and Yukon Company, Ltd., which was in liquidation. The railway was financially restructured. While most other narrow-gauge systems in North America were closing around this time, the WP&amp;YR remained open. In 1959, the first dividend to stockholders was paid: 10 cents per share.

The railroad began dieselizing in the mid to late 1950s: one of the few North American narrow-gauge railroads to do so. The railroad bought shovelnose diesels from General Electric, and later road-switchers from American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and Montreal Locomotive Works, as well as a few small switchers. On June 30, 1964, the line retired its last steam locomotive.

The railroad was an early pioneer of intermodal freight traffic, commonly called containerization; advertising of the time referred to it as the &quot;Container Route&quot;. The WP&amp;YR owned an early container ship (&quot;Clifford J. Rogers&quot;, built in 1955), and in 1956 introduced containers, although these were far smaller than the truck-sized containers that came into use in the United States in 1956 and could not readily be handed off to other railroads or ship lines.

The Faro lead-zinc mine opened in 1969. The railway was upgraded with seven new locomotives from ALCO, new freight cars, ore buckets, a straddle carrier at Whitehorse to transfer from the railway&#x27;s new fleet of trucks, a new ore dock at Skagway, and assorted work on the rail line to improve alignment. In the fall of 1969, a new tunnel and bridge that bypassed Dead Horse Gulch were built to replace the tall steel cantilever bridge that could not carry the heavier trains. This enormous investment made the company dependent on continued ore traffic to earn the revenue, and left the railway vulnerable to loss of that ore-carrying business.

As well, passenger traffic on the WP&amp;YR was increasing as cruise ships started to visit Alaska&#x27;s Inside Passage. There was no road from Skagway to Whitehorse until 1978. Even after the road was built, the White Pass still survived on the ore traffic from the mines.

During this time, the green-yellow engine color scheme, with a thunderbird on the front, was replaced with blue, patterned with black and white. (The green-yellow scheme was restored in the early 1990s, along with the thunderbird. , however, one engine still had the blue color scheme. The steam engines, however, remained basic black.)

In 1982, metal prices plunged, striking with devastating effect on the mines that were the White Pass and Yukon Route&#x27;s main customers. Many, including the Faro lead-zinc mine, closed down, and, with that traffic gone, the White Pass was doomed as a commercial railroad. Hopeful of a reopening, the railway ran at a significant loss for several months, carrying only passengers. However, the railway closed down on October 7, 1982.

Some of the road&#x27;s ALCO diesels were sold to a railroad in Colombia, and three (out of four, and one of these was wrecked) of the newer ALCO diesels built by and in storage with ALCO&#x27;s Canadian licensee MLW (Montreal Locomotive Works) were sold to US Gypsum in Plaster City, California. Only one of these modern narrow-gauge diesels, the last narrow-gauge diesel locomotives built for a North American customer, was delivered to the White Pass. The five diesels sold to Colombia were not used there as they were too heavy, and were re-acquired in 1999; one was nearly lost at sea during a storm as it broke loose on the barge and slowly rolled towards the edge.

The railway was the focus of the first episode of the BBC Television series &quot;Great Little Railways&quot; in 1983.

==Heritage railway: 1988–present==
The shutdown, however, was not for long. Tourism to Alaska began to increase, with many cruise ships stopping at Skagway. The scenery of the White Pass route sounded like a great tourist draw; and the rails of the White Pass &amp; Yukon Route were laid right down to the docks, even along them, for the former freight and cruise ship traffic. Cruise operators, remembering the attraction of the little mountain climbing trains to their passengers, pushed for a re-opening of the line as a heritage railway. The White Pass was and is perfectly positioned to sell a railroad ride through the mountains to cruise ship tourists; they do not even have to walk far from their ships.

Following a deal between White Pass and the United Transportation Union, representing Alaska employees of the road, the White Pass Route was reopened between Skagway and White Pass in 1988: purely for tourist passenger traffic. The White Pass Route also bid on the ore-haul from the newly reopened Faro mine, but its price was considerably higher than road haulage over the Klondike Highway.

The railway still uses vintage parlor cars, the oldest four built in 1881 and predating WP&amp;YR by 17 years, and four new cars built in 2007 follow the same 19th-century design. At least eight cars have wheelchair lifts.
A work train reached Whitehorse on September 22, 1988, its intent being to haul two locomotives, parked in Whitehorse for six years, to Skagway to be overhauled and used on the tourist trains. While in Whitehorse for approximately one week, it hauled the parked rolling stock – flatcars, tankers and a caboose – out of the downtown area&#x27;s sidings, and the following year, they were hauled further south, many eventually sold. Most of the tracks in downtown Whitehorse have now been torn up, and the line&#x27;s terminus is six city blocks south of the old train depot at First Avenue and Main Street. A single new track along the waterfront enables the operation of the Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley, a tourist line run by a local historical society.

After customs and Canadian Labour Union jurisdictional issues were resolved, the WP&amp;YR main line reopened to Fraser in 1989, and to Bennett in 1992. A train reached Carcross station in 1997 to participate in the Ton of Gold centennial celebration. A special passenger run, by invitation only, was made from Carcross to Whitehorse on October 10, 1997, and there are plans to eventually re-open the entire line north to Whitehorse if a market exists. So far, the tracks are only certified to Carcross by the Canadian Transportation Agency; on July 29, 2006, White Pass ran a train to Carcross and announced passenger service would begin in May 2007, six trains per week, with motorcoach return trips. Since the distance between Skagway and Whitehorse is , and the distance of line between Skagway and Carcross is , this means that about 63% of the original line is now used again. Even when the length of the unused portion of the line is excluded, the WP&amp;YR is longer than other notable North American narrow-gauge railroads, such as the Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroad () and the Durango &amp; Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad ().

WP&amp;YR acquired some rolling stock from Canadian National&#x27;s Newfoundland operations, which shut down in November 1988; the acquisition included 8 side-pivot, drop-side air dump cars for large rocks, and 8 longitudinal hoppers for ballast, still painted in CN orange. These cars were converted from Newfoundland&#x27;s gauge bogies to White Pass and Yukon Route&#x27;s 3 ft (914 mm) narrow-gauge bogies.

Most trains are hauled by the line&#x27;s diesel locomotives, painted in green (lower) and yellow (upper). However, one of the line&#x27;s steam locomotives is still in operation, No. 73, a 2-8-2 Mikado-type locomotive. Another steam locomotive, No. 40 a 2-8-0 Consolidation type locomotive was on loan from the Georgetown Loop R.R. in Colorado for a period of five years, but was returned after only two years. Former WP&amp;Y 69, a 2-8-0, was re-acquired in 2001, rebuilt, and re-entered service in 2008.

Also operational, a few times a year, is an original steam-powered rotary snowplow, an essential device in the line&#x27;s commercial service days. (The rotaries were retired in 1964, along with the remaining steam engines that pushed them, and snow clearing was done by caterpillar tractor.) While it is not needed, as the tourist season is only in the summer months, it is a spectacle in operation, and the White Pass runs the steam plow for railfan groups once or twice each winter, pushed by two diesel locomotives (in 2000 only, it was pushed by two steam locomotives, Nos. 73 and 40).

The centennial of the Golden Spike at Carcross was re-enacted on July 29, 2000, complete with two steam engines meeting nose-to-nose (No. 73 and No. 40), and a gold-coated steel spike being driven by a descendant of WP&amp;YR contractor Michael James Heney.

One organization chartered a steam-pulled train from Carcross to Fraser, with a stopover at Bennett, on Friday, June 24, 2005. When participants seemed unlikely to reach the planned numbers, surplus seats were sold to the public (120 USD or 156 CAD), with bus return to Carcross from Fraser. This represented the first paid passenger trips out of Carcross since 1982, a feature that started regular service in 2007.

White Pass president Gary Danielsen advised a CBC Radio interviewer that service to Whitehorse would require an enormous capital investment to restore the tracks, but the company is willing if there is either a passenger or freight potential to make it cost-effective.

A June 2006 report on connecting Alaska to the continental railroad network suggested Carmacks as a hub, with a branch line to Whitehorse and beyond to either Skagway or Haines, Alaska.Several former White Pass steam locomotives are currently in operation at tourist attractions in the Southeastern United States. Locomotives 70, 71, and 192 are at the Dollywood amusement park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Locomotive 190 is at the Tweetsie Railroad in Boone, North Carolina.

In late June 2010, the railroad and the City of Skagway entered into an agreement whereby the two would jointly advocate for the restoration of freight service on the line, including the revival of the trackage north of Carcross back to Whitehorse and the possibility of constructing new track north from Whitehorse to Carmacks. The expansion would require federal funds, and, if completed, would serve the region&#x27;s mining industry.

In July 2018, the railway was purchased by Klondike Holdings and Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, in a joint venture.

==Accidents==
In 1951, engine No. 70 caught a guardrail with its snowplow and rolled over on its side. The locomotive was repaired and now is in operation at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, working on the Dollywood Express.

In 1994, during rock removal operations, a backhoe operator accidentally struck a petroleum pipeline near the railroad tracks. The operator&#x27;s mistake caused the pipeline to rupture and spill between of heating oil into the Skagway River. 
Roadmaster Edward Hanousek Jr. and President M. Paul Taylor Jr. were charged with several crimes associated with the accident. Both men maintained their innocence throughout many years of extensive litigation. After remand by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the President settled on a plea agreement on misdemeanor charges of making negligent misrepresentations to the Coast Guard. The Roadmaster was convicted on negligence-related charges.

A serious derailment on September 3, 2006 resulted in the death of one section worker. A work train, Engine 114 pulling eight gravel cars, derailed approximately south of Bennett, injuring all four train crew, two Canadian and two American; one died at the scene and the others had to be airlifted to a hospital. Passenger operations on the blocked section had ended for the season just before the accident. In February 2007, Engine 114 was taken for repair to the Coast Engine and Equipment Company (CEECO) in Tacoma, Washington.

On July 23, 2014 a derailment occurred involving two vintage diesel locomotives and four passenger rail cars. The accident was due to a broken throw rod at a switch. Both locomotives derailed, and the rails broke. There were nine minor injuries initially reported, and those passengers were treated and released in Skagway. Later reports state that 19 passengers and four railroad employees were injured. Due to the derailment, the line was temporarily suspended.

===War Department Baldwin 2-8-2 Locomotives===
There are two persistent myths regarding the role the White Pass &amp; Yukon Route played in building the Alaska Highway during the Second World War. They concern the eleven new USATC S118 Class locomotives that the United States Army Transportation Corps brought to the WP&amp;YR in 1943. The first is that they were converted from gauge to gauge by the WP&amp;YR shops in Skagway, Alaska. The second is that they were built for Iran and diverted to the WP&amp;YR.

These locomotives, designated USA 190 to USA 200, were constructed by Baldwin Locomotive Works as gauge and shipped fully assembled. The MacArthur was designed by the American Locomotive Company for gauge and the smaller gauges were accommodated with spacers (rings) of various widths between the wheels and the bogie side frames on same length axles. The spacers were wide for gauge track and wide for . In total, nearly 800 MacArthurs were produced by ALCO, Baldwin, and a few other manufacturers.

The reason the USA 190–200 were never destined for Iran is that the Trans-Iranian Railway was built to . Also, because of scarce water and extensive tunnels, Iran was the first case where the Army primarily used diesel locomotives. USATC narrow-gauge locomotives were never destined for Iran.

The first locomotives of the MacArthur design that Baldwin Locomotive Works built were USA 190–200 for the WP&amp;YR, which makes them unique. The initial 1942 sale order to Baldwin was for 60 MacArthur gauge locomotives for India&#x27;s extensive meter-gauge rail network. The first eleven were diverted to the WP&amp;YR as gauge, the next 15 went to India as meter gauge, another 20 went to Queensland Rail as gauge, and the remaining 14 were meter gauge for India where the order was destined before the Alaskan and Australian diversions.

<doc id="338938" wikidata="Q508392" url="?curid=338938" title="Anthony Blunt">
<text>Anthony Frederick Blunt (26 September 1907 – 26 March 1983), styled Sir Anthony Blunt from 1956 until November 1979, was a leading British art historian and Soviet spy.

Blunt was a professor of art history at the University of London, the director of the Courtauld Institute of Art and Surveyor of the Queen&#x27;s Pictures. His 1967 monograph on the French Baroque painter Nicolas Poussin is still widely regarded as a watershed book in art history. His teaching text and reference work &quot;Art and Architecture in France 1500–1700&quot;, first published in 1953, reached its fifth edition (in a version slightly revised by Richard Beresford) in 1999, at which time it was still considered the best account of the subject.

In 1964, after being offered immunity from prosecution, Blunt confessed to having been a spy for the Soviet Union. He was considered to be the &quot;fourth man&quot; of the Cambridge Five, a group of Cambridge-educated spies who worked for the Soviets between the 1930s and the 1950s. Blunt was the fourth member of the group to be discovered; the fifth, John Cairncross, was yet to be revealed. The height of Blunt&#x27;s espionage activity was during the Second World War, when he passed to the Soviets intelligence about &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; plans that the British government had decided to withhold. His confession—a closely guarded secret for years—was revealed publicly by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in November 1979. He was stripped of his knighthood immediately thereafter and died a little over three years later.

==Early life==
Anthony Blunt was born on 26 September 1907 in Bournemouth, which at the time was in Hampshire but is now in Dorset. He was the third and youngest son of a vicar, the Revd (Arthur) Stanley Vaughan Blunt (1870–1929), and his wife, Hilda Violet (1880–1969), daughter of Henry Master of the Madras civil service. His siblings included the writer Wilfrid Jasper Walter Blunt and numismatist Christopher Evelyn Blunt. One of his grandfathers was Bishop Frederick Blunt.

Blunt&#x27;s father was assigned to Paris with the British embassy chapel and moved his family to the French capital for several years during Anthony&#x27;s childhood. Blunt became fluent in French and intensely experienced the artistic culture available to him in Paris, stimulating an interest which lasted a lifetime and formed the basis for his later career.

Blunt was educated at Marlborough College, a boys&#x27; public school in Marlborough, Wiltshire. There he joined the college&#x27;s secret &quot;Society of Amici&quot;, in which he was a contemporary of Louis MacNeice (whose unfinished autobiography &quot;The Strings Are False&quot; contains numerous references to Blunt), John Betjeman and Graham Shepard. He was remembered by historian John Edward Bowle, a year ahead of Blunt at Marlborough, as &quot;an intellectual prig, too preoccupied with the realm of ideas.&quot; Bowle thought Blunt had &quot;too much ink in his veins and belonged to a world of rather prissy, cold-blooded, academic puritanism.&quot;

In 1928, Blunt founded a political magazine, &quot;Venture&quot;, whose contributors were left-wing writers.

==University of Cambridge==
Blunt won a scholarship in mathematics to Trinity College, Cambridge. At that time, scholars at the University of Cambridge were allowed to skip Part I of the Tripos examinations and complete Part II in two years. However, they could not earn a degree in less than three years, hence Blunt spent four years at Trinity and switched to Modern Languages, eventually graduating in 1930 with a first class degree. Blunt taught French at Cambridge and became a Fellow of Trinity College in 1932. His graduate research was in French art history, and he travelled frequently to continental Europe in connection with his studies.

Like Guy Burgess, Blunt was a homosexual, which at the time was a criminal offence in the United Kingdom. Both were members of the Cambridge Apostles (also known as the Conversazione Society), a clandestine Cambridge discussion group of twelve undergraduates, mostly from Trinity and King&#x27;s Colleges who considered themselves to be the brightest minds; many were also homosexual as well as Marxist sympathisers. Through the Apostles, Blunt met the future poet Julian Bell (son of painter Vanessa Bell) and took him as a lover. Amongst other members were Victor Rothschild and the American Michael Whitney Straight, the latter also later suspected of being part of the Cambridge spy ring. Rothschild later worked for MI5 and gave Blunt £100 to purchase the painting &quot;Eliezar and Rebecca&quot; by Nicolas Poussin. The painting was sold by Blunt&#x27;s executors in 1985 for £100,000 (totalling £192,500 with tax remission) and is now in Cambridge&#x27;s Fitzwilliam Museum.

==Recruitment to Soviet espionage==
There are numerous theories of how Blunt was recruited to the Soviet Union. As a Cambridge don, Blunt visited the Soviet Union in 1933 and was possibly recruited in 1934. At a press conference decades later, Blunt claimed that Burgess recruited him as a spy after both had left Cambridge. The historian Geoff Andrews writes that Blunt was &quot;recruited between 1935 and 1936&quot;, while his biographer Miranda Carter says that it was in January 1937 that Burgess introduced Blunt to his Soviet recruiter, Arnold Deutsch. Shortly after meeting Deutsch, writes Carter, Blunt became a Soviet &quot;talent spotter&quot; and was given the NKVD codename &quot;Tony.&quot; Blunt may have identified Burgess, Straight, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and John Cairncross – all undergraduates at Trinity College (except Maclean at the neighbouring Trinity Hall) a few years younger than he – as potential spies for the Soviets.

==Joining MI5==
With the invasion of Poland by German and Soviet forces, Blunt joined the British Army in 1939. During the Phoney War he served in France in the Intelligence Corps. When the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; drove British forces back to Dunkirk in May 1940, Blunt was part of the Dunkirk evacuation. During that same year he was recruited to MI5, the Security Service. Before the war, MI5 employed mostly former members of the Indian Imperial Police.

In MI5, Blunt began passing the results of Ultra intelligence (from decrypted Enigma intercepts of &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; radio traffic on the Eastern Front) to the Soviets, as well as details of German spy rings operating in the Soviet Union. Ultra was primarily working on the Kriegsmarine naval codes, which eventually helped win the Battle of the Atlantic. As the war progressed, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; codes were also broken. Sensitive receivers could pick up transmissions, relating to German war plans, from Berlin. There was a great risk that, if the Germans discovered their codes had been compromised, they would change the settings of the Enigma wheels, blinding the code breakers.

The entirety of Ultra was known by only four people, only one of whom routinely worked at Bletchley Park. Dissemination of Ultra information did not follow the usual intelligence protocol but maintained its own communications channels. Military intelligence officers gave intercepts to Ultra liaisons, who in turn forwarded the intercepts to Bletchley Park. Information from decoded messages was then passed back to military commanders through the same channels. Thus, each link in the communications chain knew only one particular job and not the overall Ultra details. Nobody outside Bletchley Park knew the source.

John Cairncross was posted from MI6 to work at Bletchley Park. Blunt admitted to recruiting Cairncross and may well have been the cut-out between him and Soviet contacts. Although the Soviet Union was now an ally, the Russians were not trusted. Some information concerned German preparations and detailed plans for the Battle of Kursk, the last major German offensive on the Eastern Front. Malcolm Muggeridge, a wartime British agent, recalls meeting Philby and Rothschild in Paris in 1955. He reported that Rothschild argued that much more Ultra material should have been given to Stalin; for once, Philby reportedly dropped his reserve and agreed.

During the war, Blunt attained the rank of major. He was later accused of betraying Operation Market Garden to benefit both the Nazis and the Russians. This defeat was usually attributed to the Dutch traitor Christiaan Lindemans. In &quot;The Traitor of Arnhem&quot;, premiered by &quot;The Times&quot;, there is talk of another traitor, a certain &quot;Josephine&quot;, who the author believed to be a cover name for Blunt. The aim of the Soviets, and therefore of Blunt, would have been to prevent Allied forces from arriving in Berlin before the Russians. After the war, Blunt&#x27;s espionage activity diminished, but he retained contact with Soviet agents and continued to pass them gossip from former MI5 colleagues and documents from Burgess. This continued until the defection of Burgess and Maclean in 1951.

==Trips on behalf of the royal family==
In April 1945, Blunt, who had worked part-time at the Royal Library, was offered and accepted the job of Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Pictures. His predecessor, Kenneth Clark, had resigned earlier that year. The Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, who had become friends with Blunt during the two years he worked in the Royal Collection, recommended him for the job. Morshead had been impressed with Blunt&#x27;s &quot;diligence, his habitual reticence, and his perfect manners.&quot; Blunt often visited Morshead&#x27;s home in Windsor. His student Oliver Millar, who would become his successor as Surveyor, said, &quot;I think Anthony was happier there than many other places.&quot; Carter writes: &quot;The royal family liked him: he was polite, effective and, above all, discreet.&quot;

In August 1945, during the final days of World War II in Europe, King George VI asked Blunt to accompany Morshead on a trip to Friedrichshof Castle near Frankfurt to retrieve almost 4,000 letters written by Queen Victoria to her daughter, Empress Victoria, the mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The account of the trip in the Royal Archives states that the letters, as well as other documents, &quot;were exposed to risks owing to unsettled conditions after the war.&quot; According to Morshead, Blunt was needed because he knew German, which would make it easier to identify the desired material. There was a signed agreement made at the time, since the royal family did not own the documents. The letters rescued by Morshead and Blunt were deposited in the Royal Archives and were returned in 1951.

Carter mentions that other versions of the story, which claim that the trip was to retrieve letters from the Duke of Windsor to Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, the owner of Friedrichshof Castle, in which the Duke knowingly revealed Allied secrets to Hitler, have some credibility, given the Duke&#x27;s known Nazi sympathies. Variants of this version have been published by several authors. Carter allows that, while George VI may have also asked Blunt and Morshead to be on the alert for any documents relating to the Duke, &quot;it seems unlikely that they found any.&quot; Much later, Queen Victoria&#x27;s letters were edited and published in five volumes by Roger Fulford, and it was revealed they contained numerous &quot;embarrassing and &#x27;improper&#x27; comments about the awfulness of German politics and culture.&quot; Hugh Trevor-Roper remembered discussing the trip with Blunt at MI5 in the autumn of 1945, recalling (in Carter&#x27;s retelling): &quot;Blunt&#x27;s task had been to secure the Vicky correspondence before the Americans found it and published it.&quot;

Blunt made three more trips to other locations over the following eighteen months, mainly &quot;to recover royal treasures to which the Crown did not have an automatic right.&quot; On one trip he returned with a twelfth-century illuminated manuscript and the diamond crown of Queen Charlotte. The King had good reason to worry about the safety of the objects he had sent Blunt to retrieve: the senior American officers at Friedrichshof Castle, Kathleen Nash and Jack Durant, were later arrested for looting and put on trial.

==Suspicion and secret confession==
Some people knew of Blunt&#x27;s role as a Soviet spy long before his public exposure. According to MI5 papers released in 2002, Moura Budberg reported in 1950 that Blunt was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but this was ignored. According to Blunt himself, he never joined because Burgess persuaded him that he would be more valuable to the Soviet cause by working with Burgess. He was certainly on friendly terms with Sir Dick White, the head of MI5 and later MI6, in the 1960s, and they used to spend Christmas together with Rothschild in the latter&#x27;s Cambridge residence.

Blunt&#x27;s KGB handlers had also become suspicious at the sheer amount of material he was passing over, suspecting him of being a triple agent. Later, he was described by a KGB officer as &quot;ideological shit.&quot;

With the defection of Burgess and Maclean to Moscow in May 1951, Blunt came under suspicion. Burgess returned on the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; to Southampton after being suspended from the British embassy in Washington for his conduct. He was to warn Maclean, who now worked in the Foreign Office but was under surveillance and isolated from secret material. Blunt collected Burgess at Southampton Docks and took him to stay at his flat in London, although he later denied that he had warned the defecting pair. Blunt was interrogated by MI5 in 1952 but gave away little if anything. Arthur Martin and Jim Skardon interviewed Blunt eleven times after 1951, but Blunt had admitted nothing.

Blunt was greatly distressed by Burgess&#x27; flight and, on 28 May 1951, confided in his friend Goronwy Rees, a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, who had briefly supplied the NKVD with political information in 1938–39. Rees suggested that Burgess had defected because of his virulent anti-Americanism and belief that the United States would involve Britain in a Third World War, and that he was a Soviet agent. Blunt suggested that this was not sufficient reason to denounce Burgess to MI5, pointing out that &quot;Burgess was one of our oldest friends and to denounce him would not be the act of a friend.&quot; Blunt quoted E. M. Forster&#x27;s belief that country was less important than friendship, arguing that &quot;Burgess had told me he was a spy in 1936 and I had not told anyone.&quot;

In 1963, MI5 learned of Blunt&#x27;s espionage from Straight, whom he had recruited. Blunt confessed to MI5 on 23 April 1964. The private secretary of Queen Elizabeth II was informed shortly thereafter, but the Queen herself was not officially informed until 1973. Blunt also named Cairncross, Jenifer Hart, Phoebe Pool, Peter Ashby, Brian Simon and Leonard Henry Long as spies. Long had also been a member of the Communist Party and an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge. During the war, he served in MI14 military intelligence in the War Office, with responsibility for assessing German offensive plans. He passed analyses but not original material relating to the Eastern Front to Blunt.

According to his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Blunt acknowledged that he had recruited spies for the Soviets from among young radical students at Cambridge, passed information to the Russians while he served as a high-ranking British intelligence officer during World War II and had helped two of his former Cambridge students who had become Soviet moles, Burgess and Maclean, escape in 1951 just as their activities were about to be exposed.

Blunt was convinced that his confession would be kept secret. &quot;I believed, naively, that the security service would see it, partly in its own interest, that the story would never become public,&quot; he wrote. Indeed, in return for a full confession, the British government agreed to keep his espionage an official secret, though only for fifteen years, and granted him full immunity from prosecution. Blunt was not stripped of his knighthood until Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher officially announced his treachery in 1979.

According to the memoir of MI5 officer Peter Wright, Wright had regular interviews with Blunt from 1964 onwards for six years. Prior to that, he had a briefing with Michael Adeane, the Queen&#x27;s private secretary, who told Wright: &quot;From time to time you may find Blunt referring to an assignment he undertook on behalf of the Palace – a visit to Germany at the end of the war. Please do not pursue this matter. Strictly speaking, it is not relevant to considerations of national security.&quot;

For unknown reasons, Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home was not informed of Blunt&#x27;s spying, although the Queen and Conservative Home Secretary Henry Brooke had been fully informed. In November 1979, Thatcher informed Parliament of Blunt&#x27;s treachery and the immunity deal that had been arranged.

Blunt&#x27;s life was little affected by the knowledge of his treachery. In 1966, two years after his secret confession, Noel Annan, provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, held a dinner party for Labour Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Ann Fleming (widow of James Bond author Ian Fleming), and Victor Rothschild and his wife Tess. The Rothschilds brought their friend and lodger – Blunt. All had had wartime connections with British intelligence; Jenkins at Bletchley Park.

==Public exposure==
In 1979, Blunt&#x27;s role was represented in Andrew Boyle&#x27;s book &quot;Climate of Treason&quot;, in which Blunt was given the pseudonym &quot;Maurice&quot;, after the homosexual protagonist of E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel of that name. In September of that year, Blunt had tried to obtain a typescript before the publication of Boyle&#x27;s book. &quot;Technically there was no defamation, and Boyle&#x27;s editor, Harold Harris, refused to cooperate.&quot; Blunt&#x27;s request was reported in the magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; and drew his attention. In early November excerpts were published in &quot;The Observer&quot;, and on 8 November &quot;Private Eye&quot; revealed that &quot;Maurice&quot; was Blunt. In interviews to publicise his book, Boyle refused to confirm that Blunt was &quot;Maurice&quot; and asserted that was the government&#x27;s responsibility.

Based on an interview with Blunt&#x27;s solicitor, Michael Rubinstein (who had met with Thatcher&#x27;s Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong), Carter states that Thatcher, &quot;personally affronted by Blunt&#x27;s immunity, took the bait. ...she found the whole episode thoroughly reprehensible, and reeking of Establishment collusion.&quot;

On 15 November 1979, Thatcher revealed Blunt&#x27;s wartime role to the House of Commons in reply to questions put to her by Ted Leadbitter, MP for Hartlepool, and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover:

In a statement to the press on 20 November, Blunt claimed the decision to grant him immunity from prosecution was taken by the then-prime minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Speaking in the House of Commons on 21 November, Thatcher disclosed more details of the affair.

For weeks after Thatcher&#x27;s announcement, Blunt was hunted by journalists. Once found, he was besieged by photographers. Blunt had recently given a lecture at the invitation of Francis Haskell, Oxford University&#x27;s professor of art history. Haskell had a Russian mother and wife and had graduated from King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. To the press, this made him an obvious suspect. They repeatedly telephoned Haskell&#x27;s home in the early hours of the morning, using the names of his friends and claiming to have an urgent message for &quot;Anthony.&quot;

Although Blunt was outwardly calm, the sudden exposure shocked him. His former pupil, art critic Brian Sewell, said at the time, &quot;He was so businesslike about it; he considered the implications for his knighthood and academic honours and what should be resigned and what retained. What he didn&#x27;t want was a great debate at his clubs, the Athenaeum and the Travellers. He was incredibly calm about it all.&quot; Sewell was involved in protecting Blunt from the extensive media attention, and his friend was spirited away to a flat within a house in Chiswick.

In 1979, Blunt said that the reason for his betrayal could be explained by the E. M. Forster adage &quot;if asked to choose between betraying his friend and betraying his country, he hoped he would have the guts to betray his country.&quot; In 2002 the novelist Julian Barnes asserted that &quot;Blunt exploited, deceived, and lied to far more friends than he was loyal to ... if you betray your country, you by definition betray all your friends in that country...&quot;

The Queen stripped Blunt of his knighthood, and in short order he was removed as an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College. He resigned as a Fellow of the British Academy after a failed effort to expel him; three fellows resigned in protest against the failure to remove him. He broke down in tears in his BBC Television confession at the age of 72.

Anthony Blunt died of a heart attack at his London home, 9 The Grove, Highgate, in 1983, aged 75. Jon Nordheimer, the author of his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;Details of the nature of the espionage carried out by Mr. Blunt for the Russians have never been revealed, although it is believed that they did not directly cause loss of life or compromise military operations.&quot;

==Memoirs==
Blunt withdrew from society after he was officially exposed and seldom went out, but continued his work on art history. His friend Tess Rothschild suggested that he occupy his time writing his memoirs. Sewell, his former pupil, said they remained unfinished because he had to consult the Newspaper Library in Colindale to check facts, but was unhappy at being recognised.

&quot;I do know he was really worried about upsetting his family,&quot; said Sewell. &quot;I think he was being absolutely straight with me when he said that if he could not verify the facts there was no point in going on.&quot; Blunt stopped writing in 1983, leaving his memoirs to his partner, John Gaskin, who kept them for a year and then gave them to Blunt&#x27;s executor, John Golding, a fellow art historian. Golding passed them on to the British Library, insisting that they not be released for twenty-five years. They were finally made available to readers on 23 July 2009 and can be accessed through the British Library catalogue.

In the typed manuscript, Blunt conceded that spying for the Soviet Union was the biggest mistake of his life.
The memoir revealed little that was not already known about Blunt. When asked whether there would be any new or unexpected names, Golding replied: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure. It&#x27;s twenty-five years since I read it, and my memory is not that good.&quot; Although ordered by the KGB to defect with Maclean and Burgess to protect Philby, in 1951 Blunt realised &quot;quite clearly that I would take any risk in [Britain], rather than go to Russia.&quot; After he was publicly exposed, he claims to have considered suicide but instead turned to &quot;whisky and concentrated work.&quot;

The regret in the manuscript seemed to stem from the way that spying had affected his life, and there was no apology. The historian Christopher Andrew felt that the regret was shallow, and that he found an &quot;unwillingness to acknowledge the evil he had served in spying for Stalin.&quot;

==Career as an art historian==
=== Royal Collections ===
Throughout the time of his activities in espionage, Blunt&#x27;s public career was as an art historian, a field in which he gained eminence. In 1940, most of his fellowship dissertation was published under the title of &quot;Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450–1600&quot;, which remains in print. In 1945, he was given the distinguished position of Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Pictures, and later the Queen&#x27;s Pictures (after the death of King George VI in 1952), in charge of the Royal Collection, one of the largest and richest collections of art in the world. He held the position for 27 years, was knighted as a KCVO in 1956 for his work in the role, and his contribution was vital in the expansion of the Queen&#x27;s Gallery at Buckingham Palace, which opened in 1962, and organising the cataloguing of the collection.

=== University of London and Courtauld Institute ===
In 1947, Blunt became both Professor of the History of Art at the University of London, and the director of the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, where he had been lecturing since the spring of 1933, and where his tenure in office as director lasted until 1974. This position included the use of a live-in apartment on the premises, then at Home House in Portman Square. During his 27 years at the Courtauld Institute, Blunt was respected as a dedicated teacher, a kind superior to his staff. His legacy at the Courtauld was to have left it with a larger staff, increased funding, and more space, and his role was central in the acquisition of outstanding collections for the Courtauld&#x27;s Galleries. He is often credited for making the Courtauld what it is today, as well as for pioneering art history in Britain, and for training the next generation of British art historians. While at the Courtauld, Blunt contributed photographs to the Conway Library of art and architecture, which are currently being digitised.

=== Research and publications ===
In 1953, Blunt published his book &quot;Art and Architecture in France, 1500–1700&quot; in the Pelican History of Art (later taken over by Yale University Press), and he was in particular an expert on the works of Nicolas Poussin, writing numerous books and articles about the painter, and serving as curator for a landmark exhibition of Poussin at the Louvre in 1960, which was an enormous success. He also wrote on topics as diverse as William Blake, Pablo Picasso, and the Galleries of England, Scotland, and Wales. He also catalogued the French drawings (1945), G. B. Castiglione and Stefano della Bella drawings (1954) Roman drawings (with H. L. Cooke, 1960) and Venetian (with Edward Croft-Murray, 1957) drawings in the Royal Collection, as well as a supplement of Addenda and Corrigenda to the Italian catalogues (in E. Schilling&#x27;s German Drawings).

Blunt attended a summer school in Sicily in 1965, leading to a deep interest in Sicilian Baroque architecture, and in 1968 he wrote the only authoritative and in-depth book on &quot;Sicilian Baroque&quot;. From 1962 he was engaged in a dispute with Sir Denis Mahon regarding the authenticity of a Poussin work which rumbled on for several years. Mahon was shown to be correct. Blunt was also unaware that a painting in his own possession was also by Poussin.

After Margaret Thatcher had exposed Blunt&#x27;s espionage, he continued his art history work by writing and publishing a &quot;Guide to Baroque Rome&quot; (1982). He intended to write a monograph about the architecture of Pietro da Cortona but he died before realising the project. His manuscripts were sent to the intended co-author of this work, German art historian Jörg Martin Merz by the executors of his will. Merz published a book, &quot;Pietro da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture&quot; in 2008 incorporating a draft by the late Anthony Blunt.

Many of his publications are still seen today by scholars as integral to the study of art history. His writing is lucid, and places art and architecture in their context in history. In &quot;Art and Architecture in France&quot;, for example, he begins each section with a brief depiction of the social, political and/or religious contexts in which works of art and art movements are emerging. In Blunt&#x27;s &quot;Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450–1600&quot;, he explains the motivational circumstances involved in the transitions between the High Renaissance and Mannerism.

=== Notable students ===
Notable students who have been influenced by Blunt include Aaron Scharf, photography historian and author of &quot;Art and Photography&quot; (whom Blunt assisted, along with Scharf&#x27;s wife, in escaping McCarthy condemnation for their support of communism), Brian Sewell (an art critic for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;), Ron Bloore, Sir Oliver Millar (his successor at the Royal Collection and an expert on Van Dyck), Nicholas Serota, Neil Macgregor, the former editor of the Burlington magazine, former director of the National Gallery and former director of the British Museum who paid tribute to Blunt as &quot;a great and generous teacher&quot;, John White (art historian), Sir Alan Bowness (who ran the Tate Gallery), John Golding (who wrote the first major book on Cubism), Reyner Banham (an influential architectural historian), John Shearman (the &quot;world expert&quot; on Mannerism and the former Chair of the Art History Department at Harvard University), Melvin Day (former Director of National Art Gallery of New Zealand and Government Art Historian for New Zealand ), Christopher Newall (an expert on the Pre-Raphaelites), Michael Jaffé (an expert on Rubens), Michael Mahoney (former Curator of European Paintings at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and former Chair of the Art History Department at Trinity College, Hartford), Lee Johnson (an expert on Eugène Delacroix), Phoebe Pool (art historian) and Anita Brookner (an art historian and novelist).

=== Honorary positions ===
Among his many accomplishments, Blunt also received a series of honorary fellowships, became the National Trust&#x27;s picture adviser, curated exhibitions at the Royal Academy, edited and wrote numerous books and articles, and sat on many influential committees in the arts.

==Depictions in popular culture==

&quot;A Question of Attribution&quot; is a play written by Alan Bennett about Blunt, covering the weeks before his public exposure as a spy, and his relationship with Queen Elizabeth II. After a successful run in London&#x27;s West End, it was made into a television play directed by John Schlesinger and starring James Fox, Prunella Scales and Geoffrey Palmer. It was aired on the BBC in 1991. This play was seen as a companion to Bennett&#x27;s 1983 television play about Guy Burgess, &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot;.

&quot;Blunt: The Fourth Man&quot; is a 1985 television film starring Ian Richardson, Anthony Hopkins, Michael Williams, and Rosie Kerslake, covering the events of 1951 when Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean went missing.

&quot;The Untouchable&quot;, a 1997 novel by John Banville, is a based largely on the life and character of Anthony Blunt; the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Victor Maskell, is a loosely disguised Blunt.

&quot;I. M. Anthony Blunt&quot; is a poem by Gavin Ewart, cleverly attempting a humane corrective to the hysteria over Blunt&#x27;s fall from grace. Published in &quot;Gavin Ewart, Selected Poems 1933–1993&quot;, Hutchenson, 1996 (reprinted Faber and Faber, 2011).

&quot;A Friendship of Convenience: Being a Discourse on Poussin&#x27;s &quot;Landscape With a Man Killed by a Snake&quot;&quot;, is a 1997 novel by Rufus Gunn set in 1956 in which Blunt, then Surveyor of the Queen&#x27;s Pictures, encounters Joseph Losey, the film director fleeing McCarthyism.

Blunt was portrayed by Samuel West in &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot;, a 2003 four-part BBC television drama concerning the lives of the Cambridge Four from 1934 to the defection of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean to the Soviet Union. West reprised the role in &quot;The Crown&quot; (2019), in &quot;Olding&quot;, the first episode of the third season. At the end of the episode, a series of on-screen titles simply say, &quot;Anthony Blunt was offered complete immunity from prosecution. He continued as Surveyor of the Queen&#x27;s Pictures until his retirement in 1972. The Queen never spoke of him again.&quot; No mention is made of the Queen stripping him of his knighthood or his removal as an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College.

&quot;Liberation Square&quot;, Gareth Rubin&#x27;s alternative history of the UK, published in 2019, makes Blunt First Party Secretary of a 1950s Britain divided by US and Russian forces.

Blunt is portrayed by Nicholas Rowe in the 2022 ITVX miniseries &quot;A Spy Among Friends&quot;, an espionage drama based on Ben Macintyre&#x27;s book of the same name.

&quot;The Endless Game&quot; featured a character based on Blunt. Anthony Quayle played Herbert Glanville, an art critic dubbed the Fifth Man of a Cambridge spy ring who made a deal to get immunity from prosecution.

<text>Eva Bowring (née Kelly; January 9, 1892January 8, 1985) was a U.S. Senator from Nebraska. Bowring was born in Nevada, Missouri. In 1928, she married Arthur Bowring. They made their home at the Bowring Ranch near Merriman in Cherry County, Nebraska.

Bowring was active in Republican politics in Nebraska. She was appointed to the United States Senate by Governor Robert B. Crosby to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Dwight Griswold, making her the first woman to represent Nebraska in the Senate. She served from April 16, 1954, to November 7, 1954. Bowring was the fourth of six Senators to serve during the fifteenth Senate term for Nebraska&#x27;s Class 2 seat, from January 3, 1949, to January 3, 1955.

After her service in the Senate, Bowring continued ranching near Merriman. She served part-time on the Board of Parole of the Department of Justice from 1956 to 1964. She died in 1985, only one day before her 93rd birthday. After her death, Bowring Ranch was donated to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, becoming Bowring Ranch State Historical Park.

<doc id="338940" wikidata="Q931519" url="?curid=338940" title="Battle of the Pelennor Fields">
<text>The Battle of the Pelennor Fields (), in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, was the defence of the city of Minas Tirith by the forces of Gondor and the cavalry of its ally Rohan, against the forces of the Dark Lord Sauron from Mordor and its allies the Haradrim and the Easterlings. It was the largest battle in the War of the Ring. It took place at the end of the Third Age in the Pelennor Fields, the townlands and fields between Minas Tirith and the River Anduin.

In search of Tolkien&#x27;s sources, scholars have compared the battle with the historic account of the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields where King Theodoric I was trampled to death by his own men after he fell from his horse. Others have likened the death of the Witch-King of Angmar to the death of Macbeth, who was similarly prophesied not to die by the hand of man &quot;of woman born&quot;; and the crowing of a cockerel at the moment the Witch-King was about to enter the city has been said to recall the cock-crow heralding the resurrection of Jesus at the moment that Simon Peter denied knowing him. 

Scholars analysing the story have commented on Tolkien&#x27;s theory of Northern courage, which carries on even in the face of certain death. They have noted, too, the elegiac tone, echoing that of the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the use of alliterative verse, and the nature of the armour, which is mostly early medieval-style mail shirts with additions of plate armour. Others have commented on Tolkien&#x27;s vivid descriptions of battle, noting that he served in the Battle of the Somme.

The battle formed a &quot;spectacular&quot; centrepiece in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.

== Fiction ==

=== Background ===

The city of Minas Tirith was besieged following the fall of Osgiliath and the Rammas Echor, Gondor&#x27;s final barriers against the forces of Mordor. In the retreat to the city, Faramir, son of Denethor, Steward of Gondor, was severely wounded. Since the despairing Steward refused to leave his son&#x27;s side, the Wizard Gandalf took command of the city&#x27;s defences. Meanwhile, the enemy forces assembled before the city on the Pelennor Fields. A Great Darkness of smoke and cloud from Mordor blotted out the sun on the Dawnless Day. The Nazgûl or Ringwraiths, Sauron&#x27;s most feared servants, flew over the battlefield on fell beasts, causing the defenders&#x27; morale to waver.

=== Participants ===

Sauron&#x27;s army from Minas Morgul, led by the Witch-king of Angmar (chief of the Nazgûl) greatly outnumbered the combined armies of Gondor and its allies. This army consisted of tens of thousands of orcs, trolls, and Men who had allied with Sauron. Sauron&#x27;s forces included Haradrim Southrons who brought elephantine beasts, Easterlings from Rhûn and Variags from Khand, and many Orcs and Trolls. Tolkien describes the army as the greatest to &quot;issue from that vale since the days of Isildur&#x27;s might, no host so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet it was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth.&quot;

The defenders&#x27; numbers were considerably less. Faramir was outnumbered by ten times at Osgiliath. The companies from outlying provinces of Gondor that came to the aid of Minas Tirith amounted to nearly 3,000 defenders. Prominent among these was a 700-strong contingent led by Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, Denethor&#x27;s brother-in-law. Their number was smaller than expected since Gondor&#x27;s coastal towns were being attacked by the Corsairs of Umbar.

Rohan, Gondor&#x27;s northern ally, contributed a 6,000-strong cavalry army. The Men of Rohan (the Rohirrim) were &quot;thrice outnumbered by the Haradrim alone&quot;.

Further reinforcements from the coastal towns of Gondor sailed on Corsair ships to the city, led by Aragorn, who had a claim to the throne of Gondor, as he was descended from the last High King of Gondor and Arnor. He led a small force of Rangers of the North, representing Arnor.

=== The battle ===

After breaking the city gate with Grond, the Witch-king of Angmar rode under &quot;the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed&quot;. Gandalf, on his horse Shadowfax, alone stood in his way. But before the two could fight, they heard the horns of the Rohirrim, who had arrived at the Rammas Echor, the wall around the Pelennor Fields, newly broken by the invading orcs. Dawn broke, and the main battle began. The Rohirrim had bypassed Sauron&#x27;s lookouts thanks to the Wild Men (the Drúedain), who led them through the hidden Stonewain Valley of their Drúadan Forest. 
Charging the ranks of Mordor, the Rohirrim split into two groups. The left group, including the van, broke the Witch-king&#x27;s right wing. The right group secured the walls of Minas Tirith. They destroyed siege engines and camps, and drove off the Haradrim cavalry. Théoden killed the chieftain of the Haradrim and threw down their standard. The Witch-king exchanged his horse for his winged steed and attacked Théoden. With a dart, he killed the king&#x27;s horse, Snowmane; it fell and crushed the king.

The Black Breath, the terror spread by the Witch-King, drove off Theoden&#x27;s guards, but his niece Éowyn (disguised as a man and calling herself &quot;Dernhelm&quot;) stood firm, challenging the Witch-king. She cut off the head of the Witch-king&#x27;s mount; he broke her shield and shield arm with his mace. The hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck, who had accompanied &quot;Dernhelm&quot;, stabbed the Witch-king behind the knee with his Barrow-blade, a dagger from the ancient kingdom of Arnor enchanted against the forces of Angmar. The Witch-king staggered forwards, and Éowyn &quot;drove her sword between crown and mantle&quot;, killing him. This fulfilled Glorfindel&#x27;s Macbeth-style prophecy following the fall of Arnor that the Witch-king would not die &quot;by the hand of man&quot;. Both the weapons that struck his undead flesh were destroyed.

Éowyn&#x27;s brother Éomer arrived to find Théoden mortally wounded; he named Éomer king before dying. Éomer then saw his sister unconscious. Mistaking her for dead, he became enraged and led his entire army in a near-suicidal charge. His vanguard broke out far beyond the rest of the Rohirrim, risking becoming encircled. Meanwhile, Imrahil led Gondor&#x27;s men in a sortie from Minas Tirith. Imrahil rode up to Éowyn and found she was still alive, though gravely ill from the Black Breath. She and Merry were sent to the Houses of Healing in the city.

Denethor prepared to burn himself and his son upon a funeral pyre, believing Faramir to be beyond cure. Only the intervention of the hobbit Peregrin Took, Beregond (a Guard of the Citadel) and Gandalf saved Faramir, but Denethor immolated himself before they could stop him. Tolkien indirectly states that Théoden&#x27;s death could have been prevented if Gandalf had helped the Rohirrim instead, as he had intended. 

Out on the Pelennor Fields, the battle was turning against Gondor and its allies. Though the Rohirrim had inflicted enormous damage on their enemies, Sauron&#x27;s forces were still numerically superior, and Gothmog, the lieutenant of Minas Morgul, in command after the death of the Witch-king, summoned reserves from nearby Osgiliath. The Rohirrim were now on the southern half of the Pelennor, with enemies between them and the Anduin, and Gothmog&#x27;s reinforcements threatened to occupy the centre of the Pelennor, thus surrounding the Rohirrim and preventing the Gondorian troops from joining with them. Éomer was by this time only about a mile from the Harlond, so rather than cut his way through to the river, he prepared to make a last stand on a hill.

Meanwhile, a fleet of black ships, apparently the navy of the Corsairs of Umbar, Sauron&#x27;s allies, sailed up Anduin to the Harlond. Just before reaching the quays, the flagship unfurled the ancient banner of the Kings of Gondor. This sight alone put heart into the Rohirrim and Imrahil&#x27;s forces and demoralised Sauron&#x27;s armies. The ships indeed were manned by Aragorn and his Rangers, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, the Half-elven brothers Elladan and Elrohir, and fresh troops from southern Gondor. Legolas and Gimli later relate how a ghostly host commanded by Aragorn, the Dead Men of Dunharrow, captured the ships from the Corsairs chiefly through fear.

This proved the turning point of the battle. A large portion of Sauron&#x27;s forces were now pinned between Aragorn&#x27;s and Éomer&#x27;s forces, while Imrahil&#x27;s troops advanced from the direction of the city. Another prophecy is fulfilled when Aragorn and Éomer meet again &quot;in the midst of the battle&quot;, as Aragorn had said in the Hornburg. Though the advantage now rested with Gondor, fighting continued throughout the day, until at sunset no living enemy remained on the Pelennor Fields.

=== Outcome ===

The battle was only a tactical defeat for Sauron, as he had committed only a small portion of his forces to the assault, but he had lost the Witch-king, his chief lieutenant. The Captains of the West understood that their victory too would be only momentary, unless the Ring-bearer completed his task. Therefore, it was decided that the Host of the West should march to the Morannon without delay, to draw Sauron&#x27;s attention away from Mordor. The victory allowed them to send a force to challenge Sauron, and still leave Minas Tirith better defended than it had been during the siege. However, Denethor was dead, as were Halbarad, Théoden, and many officers and men of Gondor and Rohan, and some would have to be kept in Gondor in case of attack, so only a small force could be sent. The climactic Battle of the Morannon soon followed.

== Concept and creation ==

&quot;The War of the Ring&quot;, the third volume of &quot;The History of the Lord of the Rings&quot;, contains superseded versions of the battle. Some changes of detail are apparent. For example, Théoden dies by a projectile to the heart instead of being crushed by his horse; when Éowyn reveals her sex she has cut her hair short, a detail absent from the final version. Tolkien also considered killing off both Théoden and Éowyn.

The scholar Elizabeth Solopova notes that Tolkien repeatedly referred to a historic account of the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields by Jordanes, and analyses the two battles&#x27; similarities. Both battles take place between civilisations of the &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot;, and like Jordanes, Tolkien describes his battle as one of legendary fame that lasted for several generations. Another apparent similarity is the death of the Visigoth king Theodoric I on the Catalaunian Fields and that of Théoden on the Pelennor. Jordanes reports that Theodoric was thrown off by his horse and trampled to death by his own men who charged forward. Théoden similarly rallies his men shortly before he falls and is crushed by his horse. And like Theodoric, Théoden is carried from the battlefield with his knights weeping and singing for him while the battle still goes on.

== Analysis ==

=== Northern courage ===

The arrival of Rohan is heralded, the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes, by two calls: a cockerel crowing as the morning comes, and &quot;as if in answer ... great horns of the North wildly blowing&quot;. The cock-crow recalls multiple accounts in Western literature that speak, Shippey writes, of renewed hope and life after death; of the call which told Simon Peter that he had denied Christ three times, and that there would, despite him, be a resurrection; of the cock-crow in Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot; that would &quot;be some solace yet&quot;; of the cockerel in the Norse &quot;Ódáinsakr&quot;, killed and thrown over a wall by the witch, but crowing to King Hadding a moment later. As for the horns of Rohan, in Shippey&#x27;s view &quot;their meaning is bravado and recklessness&quot;, and in combination with the cock-crow, the message is that &quot;he who fears for his life shall lose it, but that dying undaunted is no defeat; furthermore that this was true before the Christian myth that came to explain why&quot;. Shippey writes that warhorns exemplify the &quot;heroic Northern world&quot;, as in what he calls the nearest &quot;Beowulf&quot; has to a moment of eucatastrophe, when Ongentheow&#x27;s Geats, trapped all night, hear the horns of Hygelac&#x27;s men coming to rescue them. The style of chivalry, too, the Tolkien scholar Thomas Honegger notes, is consciously of Anglo-Saxon knights (Old English: &quot;cniht&quot;), not a French-style &quot;chevalier&quot;. Shippey writes that prominent at the critical moment of the battle, the decisive charge of the Riders of Rohan, is panache, which he explains means both &quot;the white horsetail on [Eomer&#x27;s] helm floating in his speed&quot; and &quot;the virtue of sudden onset, the dash that sweeps away resistance&quot;. Shippey notes that this allows Tolkien to display Rohan both as English, based on their Old English names and words like &quot;eored&quot; (troop of cavalry), and as &quot;alien, to offer a glimpse of the way land shapes people&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Janet Brennan Croft notes that the battle is seen some of the time through the eyes of the Hobbit, Pippin, who like &quot;the common soldier in the trenches of World War I&quot; feels his part to be &quot;far from glorious; there is tedious waiting, a sense of uselessness and futility, terror and pain and ugliness&quot;. Yet, Croft writes, Tolkien does not follow the Modernists and adopt irony as his tone; the Hobbits too are courageous, carrying on without hope. She cites Hugh Brogan&#x27;s remark that their determination &quot;master[s] all the grief and horror ... giving it dignity and significance&quot;, a therapeutic thought for a man whose mind had been darkened by war.

Julaire Andelin, in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that prophecy in Middle-earth depended on characters&#x27; understanding of the Music of the Ainur, the divine plan for Arda, and was often ambiguous. Thus, Glorfindel&#x27;s prophecy &quot;not by the hand of man will [the Lord of the Nazgûl] fall&quot; did not lead the Lord of the Nazgûl to suppose that he would die at the hands of a woman and a hobbit (Éowyn and Meriadoc).

=== Elegiac tone ===

Robert Lee Mahon states in &quot;CEA Critic&quot; that Tolkien&#x27;s account of the battle is tinged with the elegiac, so that whatever the outcome, much will be lost. Men have the gift of Iluvatar, death. In the battle, Aragorn and Éomer &quot;were unscathed, for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms, and few indeed had dared to abide them ... in the hour of their wrath&quot;. So far so heroic, in the fantasy, Mahon notes; &quot;But many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field.&quot; The battle chapter ends with &quot;an elegiac lay&quot;, in which Tolkien has a scop of Rohan imitate his beloved &quot;Beowulf&quot;: &quot;We heard of the horns in the hills ringing, the swords shining in the South-kingdom... There Théoden fell, Thengling mighty ... high lord of the host. ... Death in the morning and at day&#x27;s ending lords took and lowly. Long now they sleep under grass in Gondor.&quot; Mahon comments that the reader mourns even while rejoicing, in his view &quot;the essence of great fantasy&quot;. 

James Shelton, in &quot;Journal of Tolkien Research&quot;, writes that Éomer&#x27;s (and Tolkien&#x27;s) use of alliterative verse during the battle functions on different levels. After Théoden&#x27;s death, Éomer declaims &quot;Mourn not overmuch! Mighty was the fallen, meet was his ending. When his mound is raised, women then shall weep. War now calls us!&quot; Shelton notes that Shippey rightly called this &quot;&#x27;midway between&#x27; a lament and a battle-cry&quot;. This both honours the fallen king, and calls for Théoden&#x27;s last fight to be continued with valour; yet, he writes, in a modern novel, the possibility is opened that Éomer will not live up to that ancient ideal: Éomer &quot;wept as he spoke&quot;. This &quot;northern courage&quot; is to go on fighting, even if one knows one will die. Tolkien has thus, in Shelton&#x27;s view, both portrayed Anglo-Saxon attitudes and humanized Éomer as a man with emotions behind the armour and the tradition.

=== Military realism ===

Nancy Martsch, in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, writes that Tolkien&#x27;s descriptions of battle are vivid, noting that he served in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. She quotes another war veteran, C. S. Lewis&#x27;s comment: &quot;[Tolkien&#x27;s] war has the very quality of the war my generation knew. It is all here: the endless, unintelligible movement, the sinister quiet of the front when &#x27;everything is now ready&#x27;, the flying civilians, the lively, vivid friendships, the background of something like despair and the merry foreground, and such heaven-sent windfalls as a cache of choice tobacco &#x27;salvaged&#x27; from a ruin&quot;. She adds to this Tolkien&#x27;s account of recovery in the Houses of Healing, &quot;a subject usually passed over in fantasy literature&quot;. As for the siege of Minas Tirith, she writes that Tolkien could have been influenced by what he had seen of the British attack on Thiepval Ridge, with its fiery night-time bombardment, the fortifications across a river, allied aircraft &quot;scouting and strafing&quot; Nazgul-like over the German lines.

David Bell, writing in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, analyses the battle, concluding that &quot;the Captains of the West were lucky&quot;, as Napoleon had reportedly asked that his generals should be. He notes that if Aragorn had been late, the battle would have been lost. All the same, Men were, he writes, usually bigger and stronger than Orcs; they were arguably better armed and armoured; and they were motivated by leadership, where the Orcs were &quot;driven to battle&quot;; with the loss of the Witch-King of Angmar, the Orcs were leaderless and demoralised. On the matter of armour, Honegger considers Tolkien&#x27;s mention of prince Imrahil&#x27;s shining vambrace. He writes that it was a piece of plate armour, hinting at a late medieval pattern; but given Tolkien&#x27;s likening of Rohan&#x27;s army to those of the Bayeux tapestry, and his explicit mentions of mail shirts, the armour in the battle must mainly have been the earlier &quot;Beowulf&quot;-style mail, with additional plate.

== Adaptations ==

=== Radio ===

In the BBC radio series &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Battle of the Pelennor Fields is heard from two sides, the first being mainly Pippin&#x27;s. One hears him discussing with Denethor, and as in the book, he has to find Gandalf to prevent Denethor from burning Faramir. The second side is the battle itself. Théoden&#x27;s speech is declaimed, followed by music. A vocalist sings how the Rohirrim host rides forth and attacks the forces of darkness. Then the vocalism changes again and one hears Jack May and Anthony Hyde, voicing respectively Théoden and Éomer, saying a Nazgûl is coming. The &#x27;opera&#x27; begins again, stating the Witch-king attacks Théoden, strikes him down and prepares to kill him. The vocalism ends here, then one hears Éowyn facing the Witch-king and slaying him.

=== Film ===

The battle is the centrepiece of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote that &quot;the battle scenes involving the storming of Minas Tirith and the climactic battle of Pelennor Fields are quite simply the most spectacular and breathtaking ever filmed&quot;. Jackson stated that he had taken inspiration from Albrecht Altdorfer&#x27;s 1529 oil painting, &quot;The Battle of Alexander at Issus&quot;, depicting the events of 333 BC, with &quot;people holding all of these pikes and spears [against an] incredibly stormy landscape&quot;.

CNN.com put the battle on a list of best and worst battle scenes in film, where it appeared twice: one of the best before the Army of the Dead arrives, and one of the worst after that, dubbing the battle&#x27;s climax an &quot;oversimplified cop out&quot; as a result of their involvement.

<text>The Vickers VC10 is a mid-sized, narrow-body long-range British jet airliner designed and built by Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd and first flown at Brooklands, Surrey, in 1962. The VC10 is often compared to the larger Soviet Ilyushin Il-62, the two types being the only airliners to use a rear-engined quad layout, while the smaller business jet Lockheed JetStar also has this engine arrangement. 

The VC10 was designed to operate on long-distance routes from the shorter runways of the era and commanded excellent hot and high performance for operations from African airports. The performance of the VC10 was such that it achieved the fastest crossing of the Atlantic by a subsonic jet airliner of 5 hours and 1 minute, a record that was held for 41 years, until February 2020 when a British Airways Boeing 747 broke the record at 4 hours 56 minutes due to Storm Ciara. Only the supersonic Concorde was faster at 3.5 hours. Although only a relatively small number of VC10s were built, they provided long service with BOAC and other airlines from the 1960s to 1981.

The VC10 was also used from 1965 as strategic air transports for the Royal Air Force, and ex-passenger models and others were used as aerial refuelling aircraft. The 50th anniversary of the first flight of the prototype VC10, G-ARTA, was celebrated with a &quot;VC10 Retrospective&quot; Symposium and the official opening of a VC10 exhibition at Brooklands Museum on 29 June 2012. The type was retired from RAF service on 20 September 2013. It has been succeeded in the aerial refuelling role by the Airbus Voyager. VC10 K.3 ZA147 performed the final flight of the type on 25 September 2013.

==Design and development==

===Background===

Although privately owned, Britain&#x27;s aviation industry had been government-managed in practice, particularly during the Second World War. Design and manufacture of transport aircraft had been abandoned to concentrate on production of combat aircraft with Britain&#x27;s transport aircraft needs being met by the provision of US aircraft through Lend-Lease. In 1943, the Brabazon Committee introduced command economy-style principles into the industry, specifying a number of different types of airliners that would be required for the post-war years, though it assumed that US dominance in transport aircraft would translate into leadership in long-range airliners and conceded in principle that the industry might have to cede the long-range market to US makers.

During the 1950s, the government required the aviation industry to consolidate: in consequence only two engine makers were left by 1959: Rolls-Royce and Bristol Siddeley. In 1960, the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) encompassed Vickers, Bristol and English Electric&#x27;s aviation interests, whilst Hawker Siddeley built on de Havilland&#x27;s heavy aircraft experience and Westland consolidated helicopter manufacture. The British government also controlled route-licensing for private airlines and also oversaw the newly established publicly owned British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) long-range and British European Airways (BEA) short and medium-range airlines.

In 1951, the Ministry of Supply asked Vickers-Armstrongs to consider a military troop/freight development of the Valiant V bomber with trans-Atlantic range as a successor to the de Havilland Comet. The concept interested BOAC, who entered into discussion with Vickers and the RAF. In October 1952, Vickers were contracted to build a prototype which they designated the &quot;Type 1000&quot; (Vickers V-1000), followed in June 1954 by a production order for six aircraft for the RAF. The planned civil airliner was known as the &quot;VC7&quot; (the seventh Vickers civil design). Development was prolonged by the need to meet the RAF&#x27;s requirements for short take-off and a self-loading capability. Work started on the prototype but by 1955 the aircraft&#x27;s increased weight required a more powerful engine, causing BOAC to question the engine development cycle. In 1955, the government cancelled the RAF order in a round of defence cuts. Vickers and the Ministry of Supply hoped that BOAC would still be interested in the VC7 but they were reluctant to support the production of another British aircraft following delays in the Britannia programme and the crashes involving the de Havilland Comet.

===Concept===

Though BOAC had ordered modified Comet 4s, it viewed the type as an intermediate rather than a long term type. In 1956, BOAC ordered 15 Boeing 707s. These were oversized and underpowered for BOAC&#x27;s medium-range Empire (MRE) African and Asian routes, which involved destinations with &quot;hot and high&quot; airports that reduced aircraft performance, notably between Karachi and Singapore, and could not lift a full load from high-altitude airports like Kano or Nairobi. Several companies proposed a suitable replacement. De Havilland offered the DH.118, a development of the Comet 5 project while Handley Page proposed the HP.97, based on their V bomber, the Victor. After carefully considering the routes, Vickers offered the VC10. Crucially, Vickers was the only firm willing to launch its design as a private venture, instead of relying on government financing.

The VC10 was a new design but used some production ideas and techniques, as well as the Conway engines, developed for the V.1000 and VC7. It had a generous wing equipped with wide chord Fowler flaps and full span leading edge slats for good take-off and climb performance; its rear engines gave an efficient clean wing and reduced cabin noise. The engines were also further from the runway surface than an underwing design, an important factor in operations from rough runways such as those common in Africa; wide, low-pressure tyres were also adopted with this same concern in mind. The VC10 was capable of landing and taking off at lower speeds than the rival 707 and its engines could produce considerably more thrust, providing good &#x27;hot and high&#x27; performance, and was considered to be a safer aircraft.

The onboard avionics and flight-deck technology were extremely advanced, a quadruplicated automatic flight control system (a &quot;super autopilot&quot;) was intended to enable fully automatic zero-visibility landings (though the autoland system did not work smoothly and finally was removed from the Super VC10s.). Capacity was up to 135 passengers in a two-class configuration. Vickers designer Sir George Edwards is said to have stated that this plane was the sole viable option unless he were to reinvent the 707 and, despite misgivings on operating cost, BOAC ordered 25 aircraft. Vickers calculated that it would need to sell 80 VC10s at about £1.75 million each to break even so, apart from BOAC&#x27;s 25, another 55 remained to be sold. Vickers offered a smaller version, the VC11, to BEA for routes like those to Athens and Beirut but this was rejected in favour of the Hawker Siddeley Trident.

The aircraft featured Powered Flight Control Units an early type of electro-hydraulic actuator; these were produced by Boulton Paul.

===Production and order problems===
Vickers revamped its production plans to try to achieve break-even point with 35 sales at £1.5 million each, re-using jigs from the Vickers Vanguard. On 14 January 1958, BOAC increased its order to 35, with options for a further 20 aircraft, the largest civil order ever placed in Britain at that time; these were to have smaller 109-seat interiors and more first-class seating. As the BOAC order alone reached the break-even point, the reuse of Vanguard jigs was abandoned and new production jigs made. To offer greater economy, Vickers began work on the &quot;Super 200&quot; development of the VC10 with more powerful Conway engines and a longer fuselage offering up to 212 seats, 23 more than the Boeing 707-320 series.

By January 1960, Vickers was experiencing financial difficulties and was concerned that it would not be able to deliver the 35 VC10s without making a loss. It offered to sell ten Super 200s to BOAC at £2.7 million each only to find that BOAC was unconvinced it had a role for the already ordered 35 VC10s and doubted the airline&#x27;s ability to fill all 200 seats. The whole project looked to be facing cancellation prior to government intervention, supporting Vickers with an order for Super 200s being placed on 23 June 1960. The Super 200 extension was cut down to for the finalised &quot;Super VC10&quot; (Type 1150), the original design retrospectively becoming the &quot;Standard VC10&quot; (Type 1100).

In accordance with its contracts with Vickers, in May 1961, BOAC amended its order to 15 Standard and 35 Super VC10s, eight of the Supers having a new combi configuration with a large cargo door and stronger floor; in December the order was reduced again to 12 Standards. By the time deliveries were ready to begin in 1964, airline growth had slowed and BOAC wanted to cut its order to seven Supers. In May, the government intervened, placing an order for VC10s as military transports to absorb over-production. This lengthy, well-publicised trouble eroded market confidence in the type. BOAC chairman Gerard d&#x27;Erlanger and managing director Sir Basil Smallpeice resigned, defending the opinion that the airline was a profit-making company, not a sponsor of indigenous aircraft. BOAC&#x27;s incoming chairman Sir Giles Guthrie was also anti-VC10; he proposed that the Vickers programme be shelved in favour of more 707s.

===Development and production===
The prototype Standard, G-ARTA, rolled out of the Weybridge factory on 15 April 1962. On 29 June, after two months of ground, engine and taxi tests, it was first flown by Vickers&#x27; Chief Test Pilot G.R. &#x27;Jock&#x27; Bryce, Co-Pilot Brian Trubshaw and Flight Engineer Bill Cairns from Brooklands to Wisley for further testing. By the end of the year, two more aircraft had been flown. Flight tests revealed a serious drag problem, which was addressed via the adoption of Küchemann wingtips and &quot;beaver tail&quot; engine nacelle fairings, as well as a redesigned basal rudder segment for greater control effectiveness; these aerodynamic refinements considerably elongated the testing process. The certification programme included visits to Nairobi, Khartoum, Rome, Kano, Aden, Salisbury and Beirut. A VC10 flew across the Atlantic to Montreal on 8 February 1964.

By this point, 7 of the original 12 Standards were complete and the production line was preparing for the Supers. A Certificate of Airworthiness was awarded on 23 April 1964 and the plane was introduced to regular passenger service between London and Lagos on 29 April. By the end of 1964, all production requirements had been fulfilled; Vickers (now part of BAC) retained the prototype. The first Super VC10 was first flown from Brooklands on 7 May 1964. Although the Super was ostensibly a minor development of the Standard with an extra fuel-tank in the fin, testing was prolonged by the need to move each engine pair 11 in (27 cm) outboard as well as up and giving them a 3-degree twist. This redesign resolved tailplane buffeting and fatigue issues incurred by operating the thrust reversers. The two inboard engines could have thrust reversers installed (such as on military VC10s), matching the 707. There was 3.0% more wing area with the leading edge extension reducing aspect ratio and wing root thickness/chord ratios, improving low speed lift and reduced high Mach drag.

Later VC10 developments included the testing of a large main-deck freight-door and fitting new wing leading edges featuring a part-drooped, four-per-cent chord extension over the inboard two-thirds and a drooped, extended-chord wing-tip that allowed more economical high-altitude flying. (This mimicked the 1961 aerodynamics of the similar-looking but significantly different Il-62.) Further developments proposed included freighter versions, one with front-loading like the C-124 Globemaster II. Efforts focused on getting a BOAC order for a 250-seat &quot;VC10 Superb&quot;, a move away from the VC10&#x27;s initial MRE role into the area targeted by the DC-8 Super Sixties. The VC10 would have needed an entirely new double-deck fuselage, which raised emergency escape concerns, and the design failed to attract orders.

==Operational history==



===Commercial service and sales===

A total of 12 Type 1101 VC10s were purchased in 1964–65, followed by 17 Type 1151 Super VC10s in 1965–69. The VC10 became an immensely popular aircraft in the BOAC fleet with both passengers and crew, being particularly praised for its comfort and low cabin-noise level. BOAC (and later British Airways) obtained higher load factors with the VC10 than with the 707 or any other aircraft in its fleet. Operational experience soon resulted in the deletion of the inboard thrust-reversers due to continued tailplane buffeting despite the engine repositioning. One BOAC Super VC10 was lost during the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings in 1970.

Ghana Airways ordered three VC10s in January 1961: two to be fitted with a cargo door, known as Type 1102. The first was delivered in November 1964 and the second in May 1965. The third was cancelled. Ghana Airways leased one aircraft to Tayaran Assharq Alawsat (Middle East Airlines; MEA), destroyed at Beirut during an Israeli raid in December 1968. The other was retired from service in 1980. MEA also leased the prototype aircraft that Vickers had kept until 1965, leased from Freddie Laker&#x27;s charter airline.

British United Airways (BUA) ordered two combi versions (Type 1103) in 1964, receiving them in October that year. When BOAC ceased VC10 operations to South America, BUA took them over, purchasing Ghana Airways&#x27; cancelled third aircraft in July 1965 (Type 1103). The prototype aircraft was purchased from Vickers/BAC by Freddie Laker and converted from Type 1101 to Type 1109 in 1968. It was initially leased to Middle East Airlines, but returned to Laker in 1969. This particular aircraft never flew in Laker livery as it was sold on to British United to join their existing fleet. The prototype was damaged beyond economical repair in a landing accident at Gatwick in 1972, and the others were sold in 1973–74. One saw further service with Air Malawi, being retired in 1979. Another was sold to the Sultan of Oman as VIP transport and has been preserved at Brooklands since its retirement in 1987. One aircraft went to the Royal Aircraft Establishment for equipment tests and was retired in 1980.

Nigeria Airways had planned to buy two VC10s but cancelled the order for financial reasons. They leased a BOAC aircraft from 1969, but it was destroyed in a landing accident at Lagos in November that year. The final VC10 was one of the five Type 1154 Super VC10s built for East African Airways between 1966 and 1970. Of these, one was destroyed in a takeoff accident at Addis Ababa in 1972, and the other four were retired in 1977 and returned to BAC, subsequently being purchased by the RAF. After the last aircraft was delivered in February 1970, the production line closed, 54 airframes having been built. The 707 and Douglas DC-8, with their superior operating economics, encouraged many of the world&#x27;s smaller airports to extend their runways, thus eliminating the VC10&#x27;s main advantage.

Marketing overtures were made elsewhere, particularly in Mexico, Argentina, Lebanon, Thailand, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, often fronted by British politicians. The final serious enquiry for VC10s came from the Chinese CAAC Airlines in 1971. It was confirmed in 1972 but by then the production equipment had been broken up. Czechoslovakia, Romania and China eventually purchased the Ilyushin Il-62.

BOAC&#x27;s successor British Airways (BA) began retiring their Super VC10s from trans-Atlantic flights in 1974, mainly due to the 1973 oil crisis, and using them to displace standard VC10s. Ten of the eleven surviving standard models were retired in 1974–75. Of these, five were leased to Gulf Air until 1977–78, then purchased by the RAF. One was leased to the Government of Qatar for VIP transport until 1981 when it was purchased by the RAF as an instructional airframe. The Government of the United Arab Emirates used another for similar purposes until 1981; it is preserved at Hermeskeil, Germany. The other three were traded in to Boeing as partial payment on new aircraft, and were scrapped at Heathrow. The last standard VC10 in BA service, G-ARVM, was retained as a stand-by for the Super VC10 fleet until 1979. It was preserved at RAF Cosford in the British Airways Museum collection; its condition deteriorated after BA withdrew funding, being reduced to a fuselage in 2006 before being moved to the Brooklands Museum.

Retirement of BA&#x27;s Super VC10 fleet began in April 1980 and was completed the following year. After failing to sell them to other operators, British Airways sold 14 of the 15 survivors to the RAF in May 1981 (the other went for preservation at Duxford Aerodrome). The VC10 served its intended market for only a decade and a half. Written down and amortised by the 1970s, it could have continued in airline service much longer despite its high fuel consumption, but high ground-noise levels sealed its fate. Hush-kitting the Conways was considered in the late 1970s, but rejected on grounds of cost.

===Military service===

====1960s and 1970s====
In 1960, the RAF issued Specification 239 for a strategic transport, which resulted in an order being placed by the Air Ministry with Vickers in September 1961 for five VC10s. The order was increased by an additional six in August 1962, with a further three aircraft cancelled by BOAC added in July 1964. The military version (Type 1106) was a combination of the Standard combi airframe with the more powerful engines and fin fuel tank of the Super VC10. It also had a detachable in-flight refuelling nose probe and an auxiliary power unit in the tailcone. Another difference from the civil specification was that all the passenger seats faced backwards for safety reasons.
The first RAF aircraft, designated &quot;VC10 C Mk.1&quot;, often abbreviated to &quot;VC10 C.1&quot;, was delivered for testing on 26 November 1965; deliveries to No. 10 Squadron began in December 1966 and ended in August 1968. The VC10s were named after Victoria Cross (VC) medal holders, the names were displayed above the forward passenger door. During the 1960s, the VC10s of No. 10 Squadron operated two regular routes, one to the Far East to Singapore and Hong Kong, and the other to New York. By 1970, roughly 10,000 passengers and 730,000 lb of freight were being carried monthly by the VC10 fleet.

In addition to the strategic transport role, the VC10 routinely served in the aeromedical evacuation and VIP roles. In its VIP role, the aircraft was commonly used by members of the British Royal Family, such as during Elizabeth II&#x27;s bicentennial tour of America, and by several British Prime Ministers; Margaret Thatcher reportedly insisted on flying by VC10. The aircraft proved capable of being flown non-stop by two flight crews, enabling several round-the-world flights, one such VC10 circumnavigated the globe in less than 48 hours.

One aircraft (XR809) was leased to Rolls-Royce for flight testing of the RB211 turbofan between 1969 and 1975. On return to the RAF, it was discovered that the airframe was distorted, possibly due to the power difference between the RB211 on one side and the Conways on the other. It was considered uneconomical to repair and was partially scrapped, part of the airframe retained for load training.

In 1977, studies began into converting redundant commercial VC10s into aerial refuelling tankers; the RAF subsequently issued a contract to British Aerospace to convert five former BOAC VC10s and four former East African Airways Super VC10s, designated &quot;VC10 K.2&quot; and &quot;VC10 K.3&quot; respectively. During conversion, extra fuel tanks were installed in the former passenger cabin; these increased the theoretical maximum fuel load to (K.2) and (K.3), the Super VC10&#x27;s fin fuel tank making the difference. In practice, the fuel load was capped by the maximum take-off weight before the tanks were full. Both variants featured a pair of wing-mounted refuelling pods and a single centreline refuelling point, known as a Hose Drum Unit (HDU), installed in the rear freight bay; nose-mounted refuelling probes were also fitted.

Conversion of K.2, K.3 and K.4 tankers took place at British Aerospace&#x27;s Filton site. The K.3s had a forward freight door, facilitating the insertion of five upper fuselage tanks in the main fuselage; the K.2s lacked forward freight doors, thus a section of the upper fuselage was dismantled to insert the five upper tanks. In the K.2 and K.3 conversions, extensive floor reinforcement was installed to support the additional weight imposed by the five fuel tanks.

====1980s and 1990s====
In 1981, 14 former BA Super VC10s were purchased and stored for spare parts. In the early 1990s, to help the VC10 fleet replace the recently retired Handley Page Victor tankers, five of the stored aircraft were converted to &quot;VC10 K.4&quot; tankers. Shortly after entering service, extensive wing tank corrosion was discovered on the lower wing surfaces; this was attributed mainly to the storage method used prior to conversion, the wing tanks had been defuelled and filled with water as ballast. Extensive wing tank corrosion rectification work, including tank replacement, often took place during major services. The K.4 conversions, as with the K.2, lacked forward freight doors, thus it was decided that there would be no internal refuelling tanks fitted. The K.4 had identical refuelling equipment to the K.2 and K.3, but lacked the extra fuselage fuel tanks and retained the same fuel capacity as a Super VC10.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, the 13 surviving C.1s were equipped with wing-mounted refuelling pods (HDUs) and re-designated as &quot;VC10 C.1K&quot; two-point tanker/transports. No extra tanks were fitted, the fuel load remaining at 80 tons (70 tonnes). The conversions were undertaken by FR Aviation Limited based at Hurn Airport, near Bournemouth. The in-flight refuelling probe was an original feature on the aircraft, but had been removed during the 1970s and 1980s due to lack of use; the probes were refitted prior to the conversion. Replacing the Conway engines with IAE V2500 was studied but was not found to be cost-effective.

In 1982, VC10 C.1s formed a part of the airbridge between RAF Brize Norton and Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island during Operation Corporate, the campaign to retake the Falkland Islands. VC10s were also used in a more unconventional sense – the Avro Vulcan bombers that participated in Operation Black Buck had been rapidly retro-fitted with the Dual Delco Carousel navigation system of the Super VC10s, enabling effective open-ocean navigation. A pair of VC10s were also painted with Red Cross markings and used for casualty evacuation from neutral Uruguay during the conflict.

In 1991, 9 K.2s and K.3s were deployed to bases in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Oman as part of Operation Granby, the UK&#x27;s contribution to the First Gulf War. A total of 5,000 flight hours across 381 sorties were flown in the theatre, flying both aerial refuelling and logistical missions in support of coalition forces in combat with the occupying Iraqi forces in Kuwait. VC10s remained stationed in the region throughout the 1990s, supporting allied aircraft enforcing no-fly zones over parts of Iraq, and during the 1998 Airstrikes on Iraq.

During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, VC10 tankers were stationed at bases in Southern Italy to refuel NATO aircraft in the theatre, as part of &quot;Operation Allied Force&quot;. The VC10s allowed Tornado GR.1 fighter-bombers stationed at RAF Bruggen to conduct long-range strike missions against targets inside Serbia.

====2000s====
In 2001, Oman-based VC10s were used in some of the first missions of the war in Afghanistan, refuelling US carrier-based aircraft carrying out strikes on Afghan targets. The VC10s provided air transport missions in support of British and allied forces stationed in Afghanistan fighting against the Taliban, codenamed Operation Veritas. VC10s remained on long term deployment to the Middle East for twelve years, ending just before the type&#x27;s retirement.

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq by an American-led coalition, a total of nine VC10s were deployed to the theatre under Operation Telic. In the aftermath of the invasion, multiple VC10s were commonly stationed in Iraq; in addition to logistics operations, more than a thousand casualties of the conflict were evacuated to Cyprus by VC10s. In June 2009, the remaining VC10s were withdrawn from Iraq, along with most other British military assets.

Between 2000 and 2003, the remaining K.2s were retired and scrapped. The surviving K.3s served as tanker/transports with No. 101 Squadron at Brize Norton, Oxfordshire and the single remaining K.4 supported No. 1312 Flight at RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands. In January 2010, VC10 passenger operations were temporarily suspended while an airworthiness review was carried out.

Following the 2006 North Korean nuclear test, a pair of VC10s were dispatched to Okinawa, Japan to undertake nuclear debris tests; this unusual task was performed using specialised sampling pods which replace the refuelling pods equipped as standard. During Operation Ellamy, Britain&#x27;s contribution to the 2011 military intervention in Libya, a small number of VC10s were dispatched to bases in the Mediterranean and were used to refuel NATO strike aircraft being used in the theatre.

The VC10 and Lockheed TriStar tanker/transports were replaced in RAF service by the Airbus A330 MRTT Voyager under the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft Project. The type&#x27;s final flights in RAF service took place on 20 September 2013, the final refuelling sortie was followed by a tour of the UK. On 24 September, ZA150 made its last flight to Dunsfold Aerodrome for preservation at the Brooklands Museum, while ZA147 arrived at Bruntingthorpe on 25 September.

====Servicing and support====
All servicing of the RAF fleet of VC10s was undertaken at RAF Brize Norton in a purpose-built hangar. Known as &quot;Base Hangar&quot;, when built in 1969 it was the largest cantilever-roofed structure in Europe; a quarter of a mile in length with no internal supports. Up to six VC10s could be positioned inside with adequate room remaining for working space around each aircraft. During the late 1980s, plans to move major servicing to RAF Abingdon near to RAF Brize Norton were considered. Abingdon was closed and a new facility was built at RAF St Athan, in South Wales – &quot;1 Air Maintenance Sqn&quot; (1 AMS); the first aircraft to undergo major servicing at the facility entered in January 1993.

After the closure of the British Aerospace factories at Brooklands/Weybridge and Hatfield, responsibility of design and all commercial activity transferred to British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) Manchester, Woodford and Chadderton sites. In the mid-1990s, when the design of detailed components was subcontracted, the design team transferred from Woodford to Chadderton. In 2003, responsibility for the commercial procurement of all spares items was undertaken by BAE Systems, at BAE Systems Samlesbury. The Chadderton site maintained responsibility for the MoD contracts for project managing modifications; major repairs and major maintenance being carried out at RAF St Athan.

* On 20 November 1969, Nigeria Airways Flight 925 crashed on landing at Lagos, Nigeria killing all 87 passengers and crew.
* On 27 November 1969, BOAC G-ASGK had a major failure of No.3 engine; debris from that engine damaged No.4 engine causing a fire. A safe overweight landing was made at Heathrow without any casualties.
* On 9 September 1970, BOAC G-ASGN was hijacked, and on 12 September was blown up at Zarqa, Jordan, in the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings.
* On 28 January 1972, British Caledonian G-ARTA was damaged beyond economic repair in a landing accident at Gatwick.
* On 18 April 1972, East African Airways Flight 720 5X-UVA crashed on take-off from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, killing 43 of the 107 passengers and crew.
* On 3 March 1974, BOAC G-ASGO was hijacked and landed at Schiphol, Netherlands, where the aircraft was set on fire and damaged beyond economic repair.
* On 21 November 1974, British Airways Flight 870 from Dubai to Heathrow carrying 45 people was hijacked in Dubai, landing at Tripoli for refuelling before flying on to Tunis. The three hijackers demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners, five in Egypt, two in the Netherlands. One hostage was murdered; the hijackers surrendered after 84 hours to Tunisian authorities on 25 November. Captain Jim Futcher was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal, the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Founders Medal, the British Airline Pilots Association Gold Medal and a Certificate of Commendation from British Airways for his actions during the hijacking, returning to fly the aircraft knowing the hijackers were on board.

* On the evening of 8 December 1988, Royal Air Force CMk1 XV109 suffered a left mainwheel tyre burst approximately 25 minutes into a flight from RAF Leuchars to RAF Brize Norton. The tyre debris ruptured the fuel lines between the left wing fuel tank and the numbers 1 and 2 engines, causing both (left) engines to shut down - leading to the loss of the left hand hydraulic system. Additionally, all 15,000 lb of fuel was lost from the left wing tanks. Following a successful double-asymmetric approach and landing at Brize Norton, all crew and passengers evacuated safely due to the potential fire risk with residual fuel leaking onto hot brakes.

* On 18 December 1997, Royal Air Force XR806 was damaged beyond economic repair in a ground de-fuelling accident at RAF Brize Norton.

<text>The World Set Free is a novel written in 1913 and published in 1914 by H. G. Wells. The book is based on a prediction of a more destructive and uncontrollable sort of weapon than the world has yet seen. It had appeared first in serialised form with a different ending as &quot;A Prophetic Trilogy&quot;, consisting of three books: &quot;A Trap to Catch the Sun&quot;, &quot;The Last War in the World&quot; and &quot;The World Set Free&quot;.

==Plot==
A frequent theme of Wells&#x27;s work, as in his 1901 nonfiction book &quot;Anticipations&quot;, was the history of humans&#x27; mastery of power and energy through technological advance, seen as a determinant of human progress. The novel begins: &quot;The history of mankind is the history of the attainment of external power. Man is the tool-using, fire-making animal. ... Always down a lengthening record, save for a set-back ever and again, he is doing more.&quot; (Many of the ideas Wells develops here found a fuller development when he wrote &quot;The Outline of History&quot; in 1918–1919.) The novel is dedicated &quot;To Frederick Soddy&#x27;s &quot;Interpretation of Radium&quot;,&quot; a volume published in 1909.

Scientists of the time were well aware that the slow natural radioactive decay of elements like radium continues for thousands of years, and that while the &quot;rate&quot; of energy release is negligible, the &quot;total amount&quot; released is huge. Wells used this as the basis for his story.
In his fiction,

Wells&#x27;s knowledge of atomic physics came from reading books by William Ramsay, Ernest Rutherford, and Frederick Soddy; the last discovered the disintegration of uranium. Soddy&#x27;s book &quot;Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt&quot; praises &quot;The World Set Free&quot;. Wells&#x27;s novel may even have influenced the development of nuclear weapons, as the physicist Leó Szilárd read the book in 1932, the same year the neutron was discovered. In 1933 Szilárd conceived the idea of neutron chain reaction, and filed for patents on it in 1934.

Wells&#x27;s &quot;atomic bombs&quot; have no more force than ordinary high explosive and are rather primitive devices detonated by a &quot;bomb-thrower&quot; biting off &quot;a little celluloid stud.&quot; They consist of &quot;lumps of pure Carolinum&quot; that induce &quot;a blazing continual explosion&quot; whose half-life is seventeen days, so that it is &quot;never entirely exhausted,&quot; so that &quot;to this day the battle-fields and bomb fields of that frantic time in human history are sprinkled with radiant matter, and so centres of inconvenient rays.&quot;

Wells observes:

Wells viewed war as the inevitable result of the Modern State; the introduction of atomic energy in a world divided resulted in the collapse of society. The only possibilities remaining were &quot;either the relapse of mankind to agricultural barbarism from which it had emerged so painfully or the acceptance of achieved science as the basis of a new social order.&quot; Wells&#x27;s theme of world government is presented as a solution to the threat of nuclear weapons.

The devastation of the war leads the French ambassador at Washington, Leblanc, to summon world leaders to a conference at Brissago, where Britain&#x27;s King Egbert sets an example by abdicating in favor of a world state. Such is the state of the world&#x27;s exhaustion that the effective coup of this council (&quot;Never, of course, had there been so provisional a government. It was of an extravagant illegality.&quot;) is resisted only in a few places. The defeat of Serbia&#x27;s King Ferdinand Charles and his attempt to destroy the council and seize control of the world is narrated in some detail.

Brought to its senses, humanity creates a utopian order along Wellsian lines in short order. Atomic energy has solved the problem of work. In the new order &quot;the majority of our population consists of artists.&quot;

&quot;The World Set Free&quot; concludes with a chapter recounting the reflections of one of the new order&#x27;s sages, Marcus Karenin, during his last days. Karenin argues that knowledge and power, not love, are the essential vocation of humanity, and that &quot;There is no absolute limit to either knowledge or power.&quot;

<text>The space complexity of an algorithm or a data structure is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely. This includes the memory space used by its inputs, called input space, and any other (auxiliary) memory it uses during execution, which is called auxiliary space.

Similar to time complexity, space complexity is often expressed asymptotically in big &quot;O&quot; notation, such as formula_1
formula_2 formula_3 formula_4 etc., where is a characteristic of the input influencing space complexity.

==Space complexity classes==

Analogously to time complexity classes DTIME(f(n)) and NTIME(f(n)), the complexity classes DSPACE(f(n)) and NSPACE(f(n)) are the sets of languages that are decidable by deterministic (respectively, non-deterministic) Turing machines that use formula_5 space. The complexity classes PSPACE and NPSPACE allow formula_6 to be any polynomial, analogously to P and NP. That is,
formula_7
and
formula_8

==Relationships between classes==

The space hierarchy theorem states that, for all space-constructible functions formula_9 there exists a problem that can be solved by a machine with formula_10 memory space, but cannot be solved by a machine with asymptotically less than formula_10 space.

The following containments between complexity classes hold.
formula_12

Furthermore, Savitch&#x27;s theorem gives the reverse containment that if formula_13
formula_14

As a direct corollary, formula_15 This result is surprising because it suggests that non-determinism can reduce the space necessary to solve a problem only by a small amount. In contrast, the exponential time hypothesis conjectures that for time complexity, there can be an exponential gap between deterministic and non-deterministic complexity.

The Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem states that, again for formula_16 formula_17 is closed under complementation. This shows another qualitative difference between time and space complexity classes, as nondeterministic time complexity classes are not believed to be closed under complementation; for instance, it is conjectured that NP ≠ co-NP.

==LOGSPACE==
L or LOGSPACE is the set of problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using only formula_18 memory space with regards to input size. Even a single counter that can index the entire formula_19-bit input requires formula_20 space, so LOGSPACE algorithms can maintain only a constant number of counters or other variables of similar bit complexity.

LOGSPACE and other sub-linear space complexity is useful when processing large data that cannot fit into a computer&#x27;s RAM. They are related to Streaming algorithms, but only restrict how much memory can be used, while streaming algorithms have further constraints on how the input is fed into the algorithm.
This class also sees use in the field of pseudorandomness and derandomization, where researchers consider the open problem of whether L = RL.

The corresponding nondeterministic space complexity class is NL.

==Auxiliary space complexity==

The term refers to space other than that consumed by the input.
Auxiliary space complexity could be formally defined in terms of a Turing machine with a separate &quot;input tape&quot; which cannot be written to, only read, and a conventional working tape which can be written to.
The auxiliary space complexity is then defined (and analyzed) via the working tape.
For example, consider the depth-first search of a balanced binary tree with formula_19 nodes: its auxiliary space complexity is formula_22

<text>How Few Remain is a 1997 alternate history novel by Harry Turtledove. It is the first part of the Southern Victory saga, which depicts a world in which the Confederate States of America won the American Civil War. It is similar to his earlier novel &quot;The Guns of the South&quot;, but unlike the latter, it is a purely historical novel with no fantastical or science fiction elements. The book received the Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 1997, and was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1998. It covers the Southern Victory Series period of history from 1862 and from 1881 to 1882.

==Plot==
The point of divergence occurs on September 10, 1862, during the American Civil War. In actual history, a C.S. Army messenger lost a copy of General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Special Order 191, which detailed Lee&#x27;s plans for an invasion of the North. The order was soon found by U.S. Army soldiers, and using them, George McClellan fought the Army of Northern Virginia to a draw at the Battle of Antietam and made it return to Virginia.

In &quot;How Few Remain&quot;, the orders are instead recovered by a trailing C.S. soldier. McClellan is caught by surprise, and Lee thus leads the Army of Northern Virginia towards Philadelphia. Lee forces McClellan into battle on the banks of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and destroys the Army of the Potomac in the Battle of Camp Hill on October 1. Lee goes on to capture Philadelphia, earning the Confederate States of America diplomatic recognition from both the United Kingdom and France, thus winning the war, which is known as the War of Secession in the alternate timeline, and achieving independence from the United States on November 4, 1862.

Kentucky, having been conquered by C.S. forces shortly after the Battle of Camp Hill as a result of Lincoln diverting key troops there to Pennsylvania, who did not arrive in time to fight at Camp Hill, joins the eleven original C.S. states after the war&#x27;s conclusion, and the Confederacy is also given the Indian Territory (our timeline&#x27;s state of Oklahoma, later the State of Sequoyah in the SV timeline). However, as a compromise, the United States retains Missouri (despite proposals to divide it) and West Virginia. The Spanish island of Cuba is purchased by the C.S. in the late 1870s for $3,000,000, thus also becoming a C.S. state.

Abraham Lincoln ends up losing the 1864 presidential election to the Democratic candidate (whose identity is never mentioned in the series) in a landslide.

In the late 1860s, Russia offers to sell Alaska to the United States. However, the $7 million (~$ in ) price tag is too much for the U.S.&#x27;s eroded postwar economy which collapsed in 1863. Therefore, Alaska remains a Russian territory.

The C.S. makes agreeable treaties with the Indians in its domain, particularly those of the Indian Territory, ensuring their support for the new nation. The U.S. Army, freed up by the war&#x27;s quick end, lets off steam by accelerating the U.S. settlement of the Great Plains and the West which also accelerated the Indian Wars, crushing all hostile tribes by the early 1870s except for the Comanche and Kiowa, who take full advantage of the new U.S.-C.S. border and manipulate the continuing hostility between the two nations to their own maximum benefit. One result is that the Battle of Little Big Horn (1876 in our timeline) never happens, a divergence that will have consequences resonating throughout the series.

In 1881, Republican James G. Blaine has ridden a hardline platform of anti-Confederatism into the White House, having defeated Democratic incumbent Samuel J. Tilden in the 1880 presidential election. Both American nations have been sanctioning Indian raids into each other&#x27;s territory. The international tension between the United States and the Confederate States peaks when Confederate President James Longstreet, desiring a Pacific Coast for the Confederacy so that the South can have a transcontinental railroad for itself, purchases the northwestern provinces of Sonora and Chihuahua from the financially-strapped Second Mexican Empire, which is still ruled by Maximilian, for CS $3,000,000. Blaine uses the &quot;coerced&quot; purchase as a &quot;casus belli&quot;, leading to the commencement of what will later become known as the &quot;Second Mexican War&quot;.

===Second Mexican War===
After the Confederate purchase of Sonora and Chihuahua, which extends the border and gives the Confederates the Pacific port of Guaymas, the United States declares war on the Confederate States. Early on in the war, Confederate troops under Jeb Stuart capture a large quantity of gold and silver ore from a Union mining town after successfully occupying the newly purchased provinces. Meanwhile, a Union cavalry colonel, George Armstrong Custer, successfully uses Gatling guns against Kiowa Indians and Confederate cavalry in Kansas. Soon, the United Kingdom and France, both Confederate allies, blockade and bombard port cities such as Boston and New York, along with those on the Great Lakes.

During the war, the Mormons in Utah rebel by severing transcontinental communication and transportation around Salt Lake City. John Pope is appointed as the military governor, puts down the revolt, and imposes martial law. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is classified as an illegal political organization, and Mormonism loses all protection under the First Amendment and is banned. The Mormon leaders are then hunted down and executed. The brutal put down of the revolt in Utah will set the stage for the Utah Troubles, which will haunt the United States for the rest of the series.

The U.S. attempt to invade Virginia is easily thrown back by General Stonewall Jackson as the Union struggles to find a general his equal. A key reason for the Confederate success in the war, in addition to fighting a defensive war, is that the Confederates are led by excellent generals like Jackson, but the U.S. military, despite possessing a massive advantage in numbers and resources, suffers from incompetent leadership. William Rosecrans, the commander of the entire U.S. army, casually reveals at one point that there is no overall strategy for winning the war &quot;whatsoever.&quot; He envisions a vague idea of the opposing armies making counteroffensives back and forth against each other, which he feels the Union would assuredly win. That lack of planning leaves the German military observer, Alfred von Schlieffen, aghast.

The U.S. next attempts to launch a massive invasion of Louisville to knock the Confederates out of Kentucky, but that soon becomes a bloody stalemate. The decision of Stonewall Jackson to command the defense personally; the incompetence of U.S. commanders; and, most of all, the use of breech-loading artillery and repeating rifles make taking the city very difficult. The Confederate Army refrains from any major invasion of United States territory for two reasons: it does not have the resources to conquer the United States, and Confederate success hinges on the support of the United Kingdom and France, who feel that they are aiding a smaller nation wrongfully attacked by a larger one, and launching offensives into the United States would be seen as an act of aggression and might cost the Confederacy foreign support. Galled by orders to wage a purely defensive war, Jackson takes them to the extreme, pioneering tactics of urban warfare and full-scale trench warfare, which devastates Louisville (in scenes reminiscent of the real World War I). The Louisville campaign quickly bogs down for the United States and results in very heavy losses with little territory gained. The United Kingdom and France continue to blockade the United States; French forces from Mexico also shell Los Angeles, and the British bombard San Francisco and raid the Federal mint there.

The only major U.S. victory in the war occurs by a young volunteer cavalry colonel, Theodore Roosevelt, and George Armstrong Custer routing a British and Canadian division under Charles Gordon invading Montana from Canada. However, the British also invade northern Maine and annex it into the Canadian province of New Brunswick, which nullifies the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which had solved the dispute.

Finally, facing defeat on almost all fronts, President Blaine is forced to capitulate on April 22, 1882. He declares that the anniversary of the defeat would be commemorated as Remembrance Day. A Republican is never again elected to the US presidency, with the party splitting into one faction led by Abraham Lincoln, which later becomes the Socialist Party, and another led by Benjamin Butler, which joins the Democrats; the Republicans become an ineffectual centrist third party. The United States, learning the importance of strong allies, seek an alliance with the newly formed and powerful German Empire, and swear revenge against the Confederacy for the humiliating defeat. The alliance sets up events for the next three series, which cover an alternate World War I, Interwar Period, and World War II.

==Primary characters==
The novel is narrated from the point of view of eight primary historical figures.
* Thomas J. Jackson, old &quot;Stonewall,&quot; General-in-Chief of the Confederate army, is ready and eager to strike at the Yankees once more. He fights battles in West Virginia before inventing Urban Warfare in the Battle of Louisville. Later he is approached by Wade Hampton III in a coup attempt but refuses.
* General J.E.B. Stuart defends the new C.S. territories of Sonora and Chihuahua from the Yankees in the New Mexico Territory, the Apaches under Geronimo being first his allies and then his foes. He dies in an Apache ambush near the end of the book.
* Colonel George Armstrong Custer, a frustrated U.S. cavalryman, serves on the Great Plains, border between Kansas and the Indian Territory and helps brutally put down the Mormon rebellion in Utah. He then heads north to Montana and wins a great victory against British general Chinese Gordon, before planning a run for president.
* Theodore Roosevelt is a wealthy, patriotic young Montana rancher who raises his own cavalry force, known as the &quot;Unauthorized Regiment&quot;. He is largely responsible for Custer&#x27;s victory in Montana.
* Frederick Douglass, a former slave and a fiery orator and journalist, observes the Union forces at war in Louisville and New York. He is briefly captured by the Confederates but is released by order of president Longstreet.
* Colonel Alfred von Schlieffen serves as the German military attaché to the U.S. He helps to plan the German-U.S. alliance.
* Samuel Clemens is a sharp-witted newspaper editor in San Francisco and a prominent opponent of the war.
* Former President Abraham Lincoln, influenced by the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, is an orator struggling to keep the Republican Party united in the cause of the working man, but eventually helps form a new party, the Socialists, which effectively replaces the Republican Party in the coming decades.

==Aftermath of war==
In April 1882, the Confederates once again defeat the United States, which allows the purchase of Sonora and Chihuahua to stand. Along with losing the war, the United States loses in a war against the United Kingdom, cedeing the northern part of Maine to the Canadian province of New Brunswick.

Following a series of speeches in Utah and Montana, and a gathering of Republicans at the Florence Hotel in Chicago, Illinois, former president Abraham Lincoln leads a group of left-wing Republicans into the new Socialist Party, an action that leads to the sharp decline of the Republican Party, allowing the Socialists to eventually become the primary opposition to the Democrats. As a result, the Republicans fade into a minor third party representing only the Midwest, which is booming in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. Meanwhile, the Democrats are driven to the right by Benjamin Butler, who leads the right-wing Republicans to merge with the party and causes a majority of the party to adopt a hard line foreign policy and the gearing of American society to nationalism and revanchism.

After the U.S. defeat in the Second Mexican War, President Blaine declares April 22 of every succeeding year to be Remembrance Day to remember the humiliation of defeat and to vow revenge. The holiday parades will be somber, with the U.S. flag being flown upside down as a sign of distress, signifying the two defeats by the Confederate States. As a result of the U.S. defeat in the Second Mexican War, Blaine loses the 1884 presidential election to an unknown Democratic candidate in a landslide and becomes the last Republican to hold the office of the presidency.

In effect, he concedes defeat in this war but sets the stage for the next one by instilling in U.S. citizens an ever-present desire for and expectation of revenge upon the Confederacy and the British Empire and embarking on an intensive program of systematic militarization on the German model, with the vision of making the United States a kind of second Prussia.

In this timeline&#x27;s New York City, there is no Statue of Liberty on Bedloe&#x27;s Island, and its name does not get changed to Liberty Island since relations between the United States and France are poor because of France&#x27;s support for the Confederacy, and there is no question of the French donating such a statue to the Americans. Instead, the island is taken up by a similar but grimmer German-influenced statue, known as the Statue of Remembrance holding the &quot;Sword of Vengeance.&quot; Whether Germany gave the statue to the United States or the latter built it itself is never mentioned.

Meanwhile, the United States will move centers of administration from Washington, DC, to Philadelphia because the District of Columbia bordering the Confederate State of Virginia, which makes governing increasingly difficult and impractical for the United States. The Powel House becomes a secondary White House whenever tensions between both countries are high.

To continue to receive assistance from the United Kingdom and France, Confederate President Longstreet had to propose a constitutional amendment calling for the manumission of all country&#x27;s slaves and making them resident aliens, but the free blacks do not have the same rights as whites, setting up an important conflict for succeeding volumes of the series.

After losing two wars within twenty years, the U.S. begins an alliance with the strengthening German Empire (formed in 1871), and it eventually starts to reform itself along Prussian lines.

==Reception==

The book received a starred review from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. SF Site&#x27;s review stated, &quot;Alternate history runs the risk of sliding into propaganda, suggesting that an outcome which could have happened is one which should have. This book has a whiff of that&quot; but goes on to say, &quot;Turtledove has researched the case thoroughly and argues it well.&quot;

==Southern Victory Series continued==
&quot;How Few Remain&quot; is followed in the &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series by the &quot;Great War&quot; and &quot;American Empire&quot; trilogies, and the &quot;Settling Accounts&quot; tetralogy.

<doc id="338955" wikidata="Q296956" url="?curid=338955" title="Rolandas Paksas">
<text>Rolandas Paksas (; born 10 June 1956) is a Lithuanian politician who served as the sixth President of Lithuania from 2003 until his impeachment in April 2004. He previously served two terms as the Prime Minister of Lithuania in 1999 and again from 2000 to 2001, and as Mayor of Vilnius from 1997 to 1999 and again from 2000 to 2001. He led Order and Justice from 2004 to 2016 and was a Member of the European Parliament from 2009 to 2019.

A national aerobatics champion in the 1980s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Paksas founded a construction company, Restako. In 1997, he was elected to the Vilnius City Council for the centre-right Homeland Union and became mayor. In May 1999, Paksas was appointed Prime Minister but resigned five months later after a disagreement over privatisation. Paksas joined the Liberal Union of Lithuania (LLS) in 2000. The LLS won the 2000 election, and Paksas became Prime Minister again, but he left within seven months after another dispute over economic reforms.

In 2002, Paksas founded the Liberal Democratic Party, aiming to attract diverse political support through a populist and reformist agenda. He then contested the Lithuanian presidential election, 2002–2003, positioning himself as an anti-establishment candidate. Despite trailing incumbent President Valdas Adamkus in the first round with 19.7% of the vote, Paksas secured a significant upset in the run-off election on January 5, 2003, winning with 54.7% of the vote. This victory was attributed to his ability to appeal to disenchanted voters who sought a break from the political status quo.

Shortly after assuming office, Paksas initiated a series of reforms, including anti-corruption measures targeting public officials involved in illegal land acquisitions. However, his presidency was soon mired in scandal. In October 2003, allegations surfaced that Paksas had unlawfully granted Lithuanian citizenship to Yury Borisov, a Russian businessman and one of his major campaign donors. Investigations revealed that Borisov had provided substantial financial support to Paksas&#x27;s campaign and was granted citizenship in return, circumventing standard legal procedures.

Further investigations exposed troubling connections between senior members of Paksas&#x27;s administration and Russian criminal organizations, raising concerns about national security. The controversies culminated in impeachment proceedings in early 2004. On April 6, 2004, the Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas) voted to remove Paksas from office on three charges: unlawfully granting citizenship, leaking classified information, and interfering in private business matters.

Paksas&#x27;s impeachment marked a significant moment in European political history, as he became the first head of state in Europe to be removed from office through impeachment. The case underscored Lithuania&#x27;s commitment to political accountability but also triggered years of legal battles over the lifetime ban imposed on him from holding parliamentary office.

Following his impeachment, Paksas was banned from running for the Seimas (Lithuanian parliament). This lifetime ban was ruled a disproportionate measure by the European Court of Human Rights in 2011. In April 2022, the Lithuanian Parliament amended the Constitution to allow impeached individuals to run for parliamentary office after ten years, thereby reinstating Paksas&#x27;s eligibility to stand as a candidate.

While serving as a Member of the European Parliament from 2009 to 2019, Paksas focused on various issues, but after leaving office, he largely stepped away from active political roles. His presidency remains a subject of controversy, with ongoing debates about his legacy in Lithuanian politics. Some analysts still regard his impeachment as a turning point for Lithuania&#x27;s political accountability.

==Early life, education and non-political career==

Paksas was born in Telšiai to Feliksas and Elena. In 1974, he attended Zemaites High School and continued his studies at the Vilnius Civil Engineering Institute (now Vilnius Gediminas Technical University). Paksas received a degree in civil engineering in 1979. In 1984, he graduated from the Leningrad Civil Aviation Academy. During this period, he competed in aerobatics competitions, participating in both Soviet and Lithuanian teams and winning several championships.

From 1992 to 1997, Rolandas Paksas was the President of the construction company &quot;Restako&quot;.

==Political career==

===Mayor of Vilnius and Prime Minister===

Rolandas Paksas began his political journey in the early 1990s as a member of the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP), which was considered left-leaning. In 1995, Paksas made a significant shift in his political alignment, joining the conservative Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives), which was a major move toward the right wing of the Lithuanian political spectrum. In 1997, he was elected to the Vilnius City Council and subsequently became the Mayor of Vilnius, a position he held until 1999.

In May 1999, following the resignation of Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius, President Valdas Adamkus nominated Paksas to replace him. At the time, the Homeland Union held 68 seats in the Seimas and had formed a coalition with the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, making up a majority of 81 seats in the 138-seat parliament. This coalition was crucial in securing Paksas&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister.

Paksas formally assumed the position of Prime Minister in June 1999, heading the ninth post-independence government of Lithuania. However, his term as Prime Minister was short-lived, lasting only five months. In October 1999, Paksas resigned from the position due to a dispute over the privatization of Mažeikių Nafta, Lithuania&#x27;s largest oil refinery, which was sold to a US-based oil company. The deal and the way it was handled created significant internal political friction. Following his resignation, Paksas was appointed as Special Assignments Envoy to President Adamkus.

After departing from the Homeland Union, Paksas joined the Liberal Union of Lithuania (LLS), a centrist party. In April 2000, he returned as the Mayor of Vilnius. Later in 2000, he became Prime Minister once again, after being appointed to head Lithuania&#x27;s 11th Cabinet. Paksas held the position from November 2000 to June 2001. His second term was also marked by disagreements within the coalition, which led to his departure.

In March 2002, Paksas took a bold step by founding the Liberal Democratic Party, marking a significant shift in his political career as he positioned himself as a populist and reformist figure in Lithuanian politics.

==President of Lithuania==

On 5 January 2003, Rolandas Paksas was elected as President of Lithuania after a surprise victory over the incumbent Valdas Adamkus in a runoff election. In the first round, Paksas finished second with 19.7% of the vote, but in the runoff, he garnered 54.9%, marking a significant political upset. His campaign platform included pledges to reduce poverty, address income disparities, combat corruption, and move Lithuania towards a more market-oriented economy. Additionally, Paksas controversially proposed introducing the death penalty for drug traffickers, which resonated with some segments of the electorate.

Paksas&#x27;s presidency began on 26 February 2003. However, his term was quickly overshadowed by allegations of ties to the Russian mafia. One of his campaign donors, , a Russian businessman and president of the aviation company , had contributed $400,000 to Paksas&#x27;s campaign. In return, Paksas granted Borisov Lithuanian citizenship through a presidential decree, which the Constitutional Court of Lithuania later ruled unconstitutional.

Concerns about Paksas&#x27;s associations led to an investigation by the State Security Department of Lithuania, which uncovered further allegations of leaked classified information to Borisov and interference in privatization processes. In early 2004, the Seimas initiated impeachment proceedings. On 31 March 2004, the Constitutional Court of Lithuania found Paksas guilty of violating the Constitution of Lithuania and his oath of office. On 6 April 2004, the Seimas voted on three charges: leaking classified information, improperly restoring Borisov&#x27;s citizenship, and interfering in a privatization transaction. The vote succeeded, resulting in Paksas&#x27;s removal from office, making him the first European head of state to be impeached and removed from office.

===Post-Impeachment Legal Proceedings===

Following his impeachment, Paksas expressed intent to run in the June 2004 presidential election. In response, the Seimas passed a constitutional amendment on 4 May 2004 barring impeached individuals from running for the presidency for five years. This amendment was later challenged, and the Constitutional Court of Lithuania ruled that individuals who had violated the Constitution or their oath of office could never again hold public offices requiring an oath.

Legal battles continued for years. In 2005, the District Court of Vilnius acquitted Paksas of charges related to disclosing classified information. However, the decision was overturned by the Court of Appeals of Lithuania, which found Paksas guilty of a criminal act. Despite this, the court did not impose a penalty, reasoning that his departure from public service rendered him no longer a threat.

In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the lifetime prohibition preventing Paksas from running for the Seimas was disproportionate and violated the European Convention on Human Rights. This decision prompted further debates about constitutional reforms in Lithuania.

===Later Political Career===

In September 2018, Paksas suspended his membership in the Order and Justice party, citing dissatisfaction with party decisions and internal conflicts. Although he distanced himself from the party, legal and political constraints, including the lifetime ban on holding offices requiring an oath, continued to limit his political ambitions. He has since expressed interest in forming a new political movement but remains barred from running for president or serving as the Speaker of the Seimas.

==Personal life==

Rolandas Paksas is married to Laima Paksienė and has two children; Inga and Mindaugas. He is also a former member of both Soviet and Lithuanian national aerobatic teams, and a skilled stunt pilot who currently performs around the world.

In 2006, Rolandas Paksas made a 47-day flight around the world, a trip which started and ended at Kyviškės airfield.
