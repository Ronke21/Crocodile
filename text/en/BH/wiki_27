<text>OJSC &quot;Yukos Oil Company&quot; (, ) was an oil and gas company based in Moscow, Russia. Yukos was acquired from the Russian government by Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky&#x27;s Bank Menatep during the controversial &quot;loans for shares&quot; auctions of the mid 1990s. Between 1996 and 2003, Yukos became one of the largest and most successful Russian companies, producing 20% of Russia&#x27;s oil output. In the 2004 &quot;Fortune 500&quot;, Yukos was ranked as the 359th largest company in the world. In October 2003, Khodorkovsky—by then the richest person in Russia and 16th richest person in the world—was arrested, and the company was forcibly broken up for alleged unpaid taxes shortly after and declared bankrupt in August 2006. Courts in several countries later ruled that the real intent was to destroy Yukos and obtain its assets for the government, and act politically against Khodorkovsky. In 2014, the largest arbitration award in history, $50 billion (€37.2 billion), was won by Yukos&#x27; former owners against Russia. This $50 billion award by an arbitral tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration was ruled invalid by the District court in The Hague in 2016, but reinstated by the Court of Appeal of the Hague in 2020.

From 2003 to 2004 onwards, the Russian government presented Yukos with a series of tax claims totaling US$27 billion (€20,1 billion). As the government froze Yukos&#x27; assets at the same time, and alternative attempts to settle by Yukos were refused, the company was unable to pay these tax demands. Between 2004 and 2007, most of Yukos&#x27;s assets were seized and transferred for a fraction of their value to state-owned oil companies.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe condemned Russia&#x27;s campaign against Yukos and its owners as manufactured for political reasons and a violation of human rights. Between 2011 and 2014 several court cases were won by the former company&#x27;s management and investors against Russia or against the companies that acquired Yukos assets. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that there had been unfair use of the legal and tax system; the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, an established neutral body used by Russia and the West since the 1970s for trade disputes, concluded that the government&#x27;s action was an &quot;unlawful expropriation&quot; using &quot;illegitimate&quot; tax bills, whose effect was intended to &quot;destroy Yukos and gain control over its assets&quot;.

An arbitral tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled unanimously upon awarding compensation of $50 billion for the company&#x27;s assets, that Yukos was the target of a series of politically motivated attacks by Russian authorities that eventually led to its destruction, and that Russia had expropriated Yukos&#x27; assets in breach of the Energy Charter Treaty. The treaty does not prohibit governments seizing or nationalizing commercial assets, but requires investors to be fairly compensated. Though Russia never ratified the full treaty, these clauses were still legally binding under both the treaty and Russian law until 2029. According to the arbitral tribunal&#x27;s ruling, the primary objective of the Russian Federation was not to collect taxes but rather to bankrupt Yukos, appropriate its assets for the sole benefit of the Russian state and state-owned companies Rosneft and Gazprom, and remove Khodorkovsky from the political arena.

==Formation and early years==

The company was created on April 15, 1993 by Resolution No. 354 of the Russian government, following Presidential Decree No. 1403 (November 17, 1992), which had directed the government to transfer its directly owned oil and gas operations into separate companies, in preparation for privatization, with the aim of developing the oil and gas sector in Russia.

OAO Yukos Oil Company, known as Yukos (ЮКОС) was one of the companies so formed, on 12 May 1993. Its initial assets included:

:*Yuganskneftegaz (&quot;Yugansk Oil and Gas&quot;: Юганскнефтегаз), a West Siberian oil extraction operation based in Nefteyugansk, part of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and Tyumen Oblast (&quot;district&quot;);
:* Kuybyshevnefteorgsintez (&quot;Kuybyshev Oil and Organic Synthesis&quot;: КуйбышевнефтеОргСинтез), founded in 1975–1976, comprising three Samara Oblast oil refineries in Kuybyshev (now known as Samara), Novokuybyshevsk and Syzran, and various other oil-related operations.

The company was named after these assets, &quot;Yuganskneftegaz&quot; + &quot;KuybyshevnefteOrgSintez&quot;. The Samaraneftegaz (&quot;Samara Oil and Gas&quot;) refinery was added to Yukos in 1995 under decree No. 864, and it later incorporated eight distribution companies in Central Russia and Siberia and assorted technical businesses.

The first chairman and president appointed to lead Yukos, then still a government owned business, was Sergei Muravlenko (), the former General Director of Yuganskneftegaz and son of Viktor Muravlenko, a former head of the oil and gas sector during the Soviet regime.

==Privatization (1995)==
During 1995 and 1996, with Russia in economic difficulty, many large state-owned industrial businesses were privatized in a second round of reorganization (&quot;Loans for shares&quot;), in which major state assets were sold off through – and often to – Russian commercial banks in a series of rigged auctions whose participants were limited to favored bidders with political connections. This acquisition of valuable state industrial enterprises for far less than their open market value also marked the emergence of a wave of Russian oligarchs – immensely wealthy Russian businessmen with powerful political connections, who held a dominant position in Russian business and politics for some time. (The first wave of wealthy individuals was banking and export driven following perestroika in the 1980s.)


In &quot;Putin and the Oligarch&quot;, Richard Sakwa offers a second perspective, that with oil prices varying from $16 to $25 a barrel, and great political and economic uncertainty, it was &quot;unclear&quot; at the time of the auction how much a company like Yukos was &quot;actually worth&quot;, and concludes that perhaps the auctions were not wildly mispriced within the context, but regardless, they were a public relations disaster which &quot;came to symbolize the flawed transition [of privatization] as a whole&quot;.

One of the commercial banks contending for Yukos – and controversially also managing its auction – was banking group Bank Menatep, chaired by its co-founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a 32-year-old early import-export (1987) and banking entrepreneur (1989), former chairman of the Investment Fund for Assistance to the Fuel and Oil Industry (1992), former deputy minister of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy (briefly in 1993), and CEO of Rosprom, an investment and holding company created to manage Menatep&#x27;s portfolio of around 30 large industrial companies (140,000 employees). Menatep became the owner of 78% of Yukos shares following a two-stage auction in December 1995 and Khodorkovsky became its CEO, and from 1997, also its chairman.

==Post-privatization (1996 to 2003)==

The initial period of &quot;oligarchic privatization&quot; was characterized by ruthlessness and bloodshed, with those having power sometimes compared to 19th century robber barons, and Yukos was no exception. For example, the former Security Chief of Yukos, Alexei Pichugin, was convicted on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder, including (along with Yukos 1st Vice President Nevzlin) the murder of Vladimir Petukhov, mayor of the Yugansk oil province in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and a vehement opponent of Yukos, on Khodorkovsky&#x27;s birthday in 1998. Initially, Yukos, like most other Russian energy companies, was badly affected by the economic recession of the 1990s; subsequent to acquiring Yukos, accusations were made of other parties being squeezed out, and Yukos became formally owned by Rosprom, Menatep&#x27;s holding company. In the late 1990s Russia was badly affected by a deepening of the economic crisis, in the course of which Bank Menatep became insolvent.
Yukos however recovered very quickly and, in the course of the next few years, became one of Russia&#x27;s largest oil companies, one of the world&#x27;s largest non-state oil companies, but more significantly, a leader in Russian corporate governance reform and corporate transparency, with Khodorkovsky being widely seen as a pro-democratic reformer who advocated for international co-operation and against corruption in Russia.

In 2001 the company paid a $500m dividend, in 2002 – $700m and in 2003 the planned dividend payout was estimated at $3 billion. Its share prices were growing quickly: in 2001 by 191%, in 2001 by 81.5%. It started international expansion, purchasing 49% shares of Transpetrol (Slovakia) and 53% shares of Mazeikiu Nafta (Lithuania). In 2002 four companies – Yukos, Lukoil, TNK and Sibneft – established a consortium to build a pipeline from Western Siberia to Murmansk.

In a marked change of direction which gained considerable United States coverage, the company and its owner came to be seen as and setting aside the dubious conduct previously associated with it in the early oligarch years. Yukos had five Americans on its board, and Khodorkovsky&#x27;s charity &quot;Open Russia&quot; listed Henry Kissinger and Lord (Jacob) Rothschild as chairmen. In 2001 the company donated $1 million to the Library of Congress Open World Program, to aid the development of Russian leadership and rule of law, in part by funding Russian judges to visit and observe United States courts.

In a 2002 profile, &quot;Forbes&quot; described Khodorkovsky as being &quot;vilified by the West&quot; until quite recently, but now being seen as perhaps &quot;the West&#x27;s best friend&quot;. It stated that in Russia, &quot;the financial free-for-all is yielding to an ethic of reinvesting in your business&quot; with Khodorkovsky &quot;leading the charge&quot;, with Yukos now having an American chief financial officer and publishing its previous three years of financial accounts in compliance with U.S. GAAP standards. It quoted Khodorkovsky as saying, &quot;By now we understand how business is done in the West... I earn money in dividends and with the increase in the market capitalization of my company&quot;. At the peak of its success, Yukos was producing 20% of Russian oil—about 2% of world production; in its final year before being broken up (2003–2004), Yukos pumped 1.7 million barrels of oil a day. In April 2003, Yukos agreed to a merger/takeover with Sibneft, to create the fourth largest private company in the world, although this merger became undone in the aftermath of the October 2003 arrest of its CEO.

==Yukos tax claims, breakup, and aftermath==
Although weak at the time of the auctions and the economic downturn of the mid-1990s, from 2000 the government under new leader Vladimir Putin grew in strength, until it became able politically to outweigh the power of the oligarchs. On October 25, 2003, Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Leonid Bershidsky, founder of Russian business newspaper &quot;Vedomosti&quot;, wrote: &quot;Any of the oligarchs could have faced similar charges; Khodorkovsky&#x27;s imprisonment made them so docile that Putin confined himself to making an example of just one victim&quot;.

Control of Mikhail Khodorkovsky&#x27;s shares in the Russian oil giant Yukos have passed to Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild upon his arrest.

At the time of his arrest, Khodorkovsky was believed to be the wealthiest man in Russia and was listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the 16th richest person in the world, with a fortune estimated at $15 billion. His eventual sentence in 2005 was for 10 years, and attracted widespread international concern related to a perceived political motivation and lack of due process.

(The European Court of Human Rights eventually ruled that while the arrest and several other points were unlawful, he was not a &quot;political prisoner&quot; since the charges against him had been based on reasonable suspicion.)

The arrest was followed by a tax investigation into Yukos by the tax authorities, in December 2003, after which in April 2004 Yukos was issued in stages with tax claims for $27 billion, a sum that exceeded its total revenues for 2002 and 2003. At the same time, Yukos&#x27; assets were frozen by the government and offers exploring other ways to settle, such as payment in stages or sale of non-core assets, were refused or ignored. In July 2004, its core asset, Yuganskneftegaz – producing 60% of the company&#x27;s oil and by itself as much oil as Iraq or Libya and variously valued between $14.7 to $22 billion and $30.4 billion – was confiscated.

In December 2004, Yuganskneftegaz was sold for $9.35 billion in a closed-room auction of just two bidders (one of which, Gazpromneft, was subject to a US court injunction and did not enter a bid ), and an unknown front company called Baikalfinansgrup which had been registered a few days before the auction, and whose bid was financed by state-owned oil company Rosneft. Rosneft acquired Baikalfinansgrup within days of the auction, at which point the tax bill was &quot;slashed&quot;. Just over a year later Yuganskneftegaz was formally valued by Rosneft at $56 billion. On February 7, 2006, in response to a question posed by a Spanish journalist, Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosed that Rosneft had used Baikalfinansgrup as a vehicle to acquire Yuganskneftegaz to protect itself against litigation risks. Yukos was bankrupted in 2006 and liquidated in 2007.

===Tax claims===
In July 2004, Yukos was charged with tax evasion, for an amount of over US$27 billion. The Russian government accused the company of misusing tax havens inside Russia in the 1990s so as to reduce its tax burden; havens were set up by most major oil producers in outlying areas of Russia which had been granted special tax status to assist in their economic development; such &quot;onshore-offshore&quot; were used to evade profit taxes, resulting in Yukos having an effective tax rate of 11%, vs a statutory rate of 30% at the time. Yukos claims its actions were legal at the time and that the company used the same tax optimisation schemes as other Russian oil companies, such as Lukoil, TNK-BP and Sibneft. However, Yukos was the only one to be charged with tax evasion and penalised by the authorities.

Yukos subsidiaries declared the oil they produced to be &quot;oil-containing liquids&quot; to avoid paying full taxes. A general crackdown on such tax evasion practices began with Putin&#x27;s presidency, with numerous companies closing or purchasing their trading vehicles. A management presentation from December 2004 shows that the tax claims put the &quot;total tax burden&quot; for 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 at 67%, 105%, 111%, and 83% of the company&#x27;s declared revenue during those years. As a comparison, the annual tax bill of Gazprom is about US$4 billion on 2003 revenues of US$28.867 billion. Yukos&#x27; parent company, Menatep, lobbied extensively and successfully to influence Western public opinion, retaining Margery Kraus of APCO who successfully pushed through resolutions inter alia before the US House of Representatives and the Council of Europe. According to a resolution of the Council of Europe,

: &quot;Intimidating action by different law-enforcement agencies against Yukos and its business partners and other institutions linked to Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates and the careful preparation of this action in terms of public relations, taken together, give a picture of a co-ordinated attack by the state.&quot;

: This &quot;raises serious issues pertaining to the principle of&quot; nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege &quot;laid down in Article 7 of the ECHR and also to the right to the protection of property laid down in Article 1 of the Additional Protocol to the ECHR.&quot;

: &quot;The circumstances of the sale by auction of Yuganskneftegaz to “Baikal Finance Group&quot; and the swift takeover of the latter by state-owned Rosneft raises additional issues related to the protection of property (ECHR, Additional Protocol, Article 1). This concerns both the circumstances of the auction itself, resulting in a price far below the fair market-value, and the way Yukos was forced to sell off its principal asset, by way of trumped-up tax reassessments leading to a total tax burden far exceeding that of Yukos&#x27;s competitors, and for 2002 even exceeding Yukos’ total revenue for that year.&quot; 

===Forced sale of assets===
In the Western media and the Russian opposition media the high-profile arrest of Khodorkovsky is usually attributed to his activism in the Russian political process.

On October 31, 2003, shortly after the arrest of the company&#x27;s CEO, the Russian government froze ownership of 44% of the company&#x27;s shares. The reason given was to prevent a group of shareholders led by Khodorkovsky from selling a large stake of the company to the US oil firm Exxon. A Yukos shareholders&#x27; meeting scheduled for December 20, 2004 was to discuss a &quot;crisis plan.&quot; A Russian company must hold such a meeting before it can apply for bankruptcy in Russia. The Russian Government sold Yukos&#x27;s main production unit, known as &quot;Yuganskneftegas&quot;, at auction on December 19, 2004 to recover some of US$28 billion in alleged tax debts, following the loss of an appeal by the firm. Menatep, the company representing Khodorkovsky, promised to challenge the sale&#x27;s legality in a number of countries, and to sue the buyer and any company helping to fund the deal. The expected buyer was the 38% Russian state owned company OAO Gazprom. Some European and American oil firms decided not to bid. 

On December 19, 2004, the Baikalfinansgrup, an unknown company registered several days before the auction in Tver at an address where a snack bar was located, won the auction for Yukos&#x27;s subsidiary Yuganskneftegas with a 260.75 billion rubles ($9.4 billion) bid.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFE/RL_2004-12-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to people familiar with the auction only two bidders registered for, and were present during, the auction process: Baikalfinansgrup and Gazprom&#x27;s former oil unit Gazpromneft. Accounts from the auction say that the first bid of US$8.6 billion came from Baikal. When the auctioneer asked Gazpromneft to offer its price, a representative of the company asked to make a telephone call and left the room. A few minutes earlier, the auctioneer had told participants that using a mobile phone or leaving the room was against the rules. When a Gazpromneft representative returned to the room, Baikal made a bid of US$9.3 billion. Gazpromneft never placed a bid or spoke out. Shortly after the Yuganskneftegaz auction, Rosneft, Russian state-owned oil company, acquired 100% of shares in Baikalfinansgrup. The acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz significantly increased Rosneft&#x27;s profits and made it one of the largest oil companies in Russia.

===Bankruptcy===
On June 15, 2006, based on a bank deposit of US$4 million and its American CEO&#x27;s Houston home, Yukos filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States, estimating its assets at US$12.3 billion and its debts at US$30.8 billion, including &quot;alleged taxes owed to the Russian government&quot;. It accused the Russian authorities of &quot;an unprecedented campaign of illegal, discriminatory, and disproportionate tax claims escalating into raids and confiscations, culminating in intimidation and arrests&quot;. After several weeks of deliberation, the Houston court declared that under no conceivable theory could Yukos assert domicile in the United States. On July 25, 2006, the creditors of Yukos decided to file for bankruptcy after the bankruptcy manager recommended the company be liquidated.

===Management responses===
At the time, key management included:
*CEO: Steven M. Theede
*CFO: Bruce K. Misamore
*Chairman of the board: Viktor Gerashchenko

By mid-December, 2004, all members of the board of Yukos, and most of the company&#x27;s senior managers, had left Russia, some of them because of &quot;fear of arrest&quot; after being &quot;summoned for questioning by prosecutors&quot;. According to a December 2004 Houston, Texas court filing, the CFO resides in Houston. According to a company spokeswoman the CEO resided in London, UK as of December 2004.
Executives Mikhail Brudno and Vladimir Dubov fled to Israel in 2003, and were seen on February 2, 2005 in Washington, D.C. at an official function for President George W. Bush.

Both men were cited in an international arrest warrant regarding their involvement in the Yukos tax case. On Wednesday, April 6, 2006, the company&#x27;s Executive Vice President, Vasily Aleksanyan, was arrested just six days into his new role. Yukos commented on its web site that, &quot;We can only assume that this action against him is a direct result of his accepting a position to work to protect Yukos Oil Company and its legitimate stakeholders.&quot; The following month, it was reported that some individuals established themselves as the &quot;New Management&quot; of Yukos. However, this was apparently an illegal act, as Yukos &quot;emphatically rejected&quot; the legitimacy of the &quot;new management&quot; which had Vinokurov as president. According to Yukos, these individuals were &quot;loyal to Rosneft&quot; and had as goal the downfall of Yukos. A Yukos lawyer, Pavel Ivlev, was accused of several crimes, after which he moved to the USA. In July 2006, one week before creditors would vote if they should file for bankruptcy, Steven Theede resigned his function as he believed the outcome of this vote was already fixed and therefore this meeting would qualify as a &quot;sham&quot;.

===International legal proceedings of former Yukos shareholders vs. Russia===

The Yukos Oil Company&#x27;s former shareholders and management filed a series of claims in courts and arbitration panels in various countries, seeking compensation for their expropriation. The largest, for over $100 billion, was filed at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2007 and resulted in the arbitrators awarding Yukos majority shareholders over US$50 billion in damages. US and Russian investors, representing about 15 percent and 5 percent of Yukos, respectively, lack the benefit of an investment treaty. The sole remedy of US-based investors in seeking approximately $12 billion in redress is to request the State Department and the Office of the United States Trade Representative to espouse the claim to their Russian counterparts, as it is determined by the Magnitsky Act of 2012; State Department officials have reportedly raised Yukos investors&#x27; concerns at deputy prime minister level in the past.

The total final award in damages announced by the Permanent Court of Arbitration on July 18, 2014 was some $50 billion.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled for Russia to pay the former owners Yukos €1.87 billion ($2.51 billion) in compensation for unfair proceedings of the tax evasion case. Yukos is asking for $333 million to cover losses incurred after its accounts were frozen plus costs and interests.

On 20 April 2016 the District Court of The Hague set aside the decisions of the PCA, ruling that it had no jurisdiction as provisional application of the ECT arbitration clause violated Russian law. In February 2020, the Court of Appeal of the Hague reversed the invalidation and held that the PCA awards were valid.

<doc id="327217" wikidata="Q1325825" url="?curid=327217" title="Id Kah Mosque">
<text>The Id Kah Mosque (, ; ; from Persian: عیدگاه, Eidgāh, meaning &quot;Place of Festivities&quot;) is a historic mosque and tourist site located in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China.

==History==
The mosque was built in 1442 (although it incorporated older structures dating back to 996) by Saqsiz Mirza, the elder of two sons of Amir Sayyid Ali, to commemorate his ancestors. The mosque covers an area of around 16,000 square meters.

The mosque&#x27;s modern golden-brick structure was built in 1798, replacing the older building, and was further expanded in 1838 to its current size.

On 9 August 1933, Chinese Muslim General Ma Zhancang killed and beheaded the Uyghur leader Timur Beg, displaying his head on a spike at Id Kah mosque.

In March 1934, it was reported that the Uyghur emir Abdullah Bughra was also beheaded, the head being displayed at Id Kah mosque.

In April 1934, the Chinese Muslim general Ma Zhongying gave a speech at Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar, telling the Uyghurs to be loyal to the Republic of China Kuomintang government of Nanjing.

The mosque received a renovation in 1981, and the mosque&#x27;s façade was covered with tiles between 2004 and 2005.

Akbar Rafsanjani, the president of Iran, visited the mosque in September 1992.

On 30 July 2014, the imam of the mosque at the time, Jume Tahir, was stabbed to death by extremists shortly after attending morning prayers. His unknown successor was jailed for 15 years by the Chinese authorities in 2017, having been accused of spreading extremism.

The current imam of the mosque is Memet Jume.

===Decline in attendance===
In 2009, Id Kah was the largest mosque in Xinjiang and in China. Every Friday, it housed nearly 10,000 worshippers and could accommodate up to 20,000. On other days of the week, around 2,000 Muslims came to the mosque to pray.

In 2011, between 4,000 and 5,000 people attended Friday prayers in the mosque. However, the current mosque&#x27;s imam, Memet Jume, said in a 2021 interview with the Associated Press that the number of worshippers attending Friday prayers at the mosque dropped to between 800 and 900 in 2021; he attributed the drop to &quot;a natural shift in values&quot;, rather than Chinese government policies.

==Architecture==
The mosque incorporates architectural features observed in Central Asian, West Asian and to a lesser extent, Chinese architecture. The mosque is centered around the prayer hall and has a courtyard on both sides of it.

The Id Kah Mosque consists of a chapel, a sutra hall, a gate tower and some other auxiliary buildings. The temple gate is made of yellow bricks, the gate is 4.7 meters high, 4.3 meters wide, and the gate building is about 17 meters high. Two 18-meter-high minarets are built asymmetrically on both sides of the gate tower, and a crescent moon stands on the top of the tower. At dawn each day, the imam in the temple will climb the tower five times and call for Muslims to come and worship. Behind the gate tower is a large arch, with a minaret at the top.

==Entrance plaque==
Radio Free Asia reported in 2018 that a plaque containing Quranic scriptures, which had long hung outside the front entrance of the mosque, had been removed by authorities. Turghunjan Alawudun of the World Uyghur Congress said that the move was &quot;one aspect of the Chinese regime’s evil policies meant to eliminate the Islamic faith among Uyghurs, to eliminate Uyghur faith, literary works, and language.&quot; In May 2020, Radio Free Asia again reported on the removal of the plaque.

==Current status==

&quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; have reported that the Id Kah Mosque has been transformed from a working mosque into a tourist attraction. Henryk Szadziewski from the US-based Uyghur Human Rights Project told Radio Free Asia that while the mosque remains standing, &quot;its disappearance would cause outrage given its importance. The significance of its existence to the Chinese authorities is to demonstrate to the world observance of Uyghurs&#x27; religious freedoms.&quot; According to Uyghur imam Ali Akbar Dumallah, who fled China in 2012, scenes of small groups of people praying at the Id Kah and other mosques are staged by the government for visitors. According to the World Uyghur Congress, a mass celebration that took place outside Id Kah Mosque during the 2021 celebration Eid al-Fitr was staged as part of a propaganda facade by Chinese authorities to attempt to falsely portray Xinjiang as a region with strong religious freedom and to whitewash its religious repression in the region.

<text>Timeshard were a British electronic dance music act, who came to prominence during the Second Summer of Love in 1989. Composed of members Gobber, Psi and Steven Angstrom, the band became known as one of the UK&#x27;s first &quot;live acid house&quot; acts. 

==Career==
The band&#x27;s early sound incorporated elements of ethno-techno, trance, and dub, featuring analogue synthesizers, sequencers and drum machines overlaid with glissando guitars and an electric sitar. Their initial success came on the UK&#x27;s underground free festival circuit, which attracted acid house fans seeking dance music events outside of mainstream club culture, which had yet to develop the &#x27;superclub&#x27; model exemplified by Cream and Fabric.

In February 1994 Timeshard were receiving positive reviews, and were said to have three record labels seeking to sign them. In the same month they were featured on BBC Radio 1, with a session on John Peel&#x27;s show, where they performed &quot;God Says No To Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Oracle&quot;, and &quot;Cosmic Carrot (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot;.

After 1996, the band&#x27;s career suffered as the 1994 Criminal Justice Bill killed many venues, and their record company Planet Dog experienced financial difficulties, leading them to attempt to distribute their music online via MP3 files in a deal with webmusic distribution pioneers eMusic.

<doc id="327224" wikidata="Q2604022" url="?curid=327224" title="Zhili">
<text>Zhili, alternately romanized as Chihli, was a northern administrative region of China since the 14th century that lasted through the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty until 1911, when the region was dissolved, converted to a province, and renamed Hebei in 1928.

==History==
The name &quot;Zhili&quot; means &quot;directly ruled&quot; and indicates regions directly ruled by the imperial government of China. Zhili province was first constituted during the Ming dynasty when the capital of China was located at Nanjing along the Yangtze River. In 1403, the Ming Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beiping, which was subsequently renamed Beijing. The region known as North Zhili was composed of parts of the modern provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, including the provincial-level municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin. There was another region located around the &quot;reserve capital&quot; Nanjing known as South Zhili that included parts of what are today the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, including the provincial-level municipality of Shanghai.

During the Qing dynasty, Nanjing lost its status as the &quot;second capital&quot; and Southern Zhili was reconstituted as a regular province, Jiangnan, while Northern Zhili was renamed Zhili Province. In the 18th century the borders of Zhili province were redrawn and spread over what is today Beijing, Tianjin and the provinces of Hebei, Western Liaoning, Northern Henan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

After the collapse of Qing dynasty, in 1911, the National Government of the Republic of China converted Zhili into a province as Zhili Province. In 1928 the National Government assigned portions of northern Zhili province to its neighbors in the north and renamed the remainder Hebei Province.

<text>King Xuan of Zhou, personal name Ji Jing, was king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty; his reign has been reconstructed to be 827/25782 BC. He worked to restore royal authority after the Gonghe Regency. He fought the &quot;Western Barbarians&quot; (probably Xianyun) and another group on the Huai River to the southeast. In the ninth year of his reign, he called a meeting of all the lords. Later he intervened militarily in succession struggles in the states of Lu, Wey and Qi.

<doc id="327233" wikidata="Q1341612" url="?curid=327233" title="Savoy Records">
<text>Savoy Records is an American record company and label established by Herman Lubinsky in 1942 in Newark, New Jersey. Savoy specialized in jazz, rhythm and blues, and gospel music.

In September 2017, Savoy was acquired by Concord Bicycle Music.

==History==
In the 1940s, Savoy recorded some of the biggest names in jazz, including Charlie Parker, Erroll Garner, Dexter Gordon, J. J. Johnson, Fats Navarro, and Miles Davis. In 1948, it began buying other labels: Bop, Discovery, National, and Regent. It also reissued music from Jewel Records. In the early 1960s, Savoy briefly recorded several avant-garde jazz artists. These included Paul Bley, Bill Dixon, Charles Moffett, Perry Robinson, Archie Shepp, Sun Ra, Marzette Watts, and Valdo Williams.

After Lubinsky&#x27;s death in 1974, Clive Davis, then manager of Arista Records, acquired Savoy&#x27;s catalogue. After that, Joe Fields of Muse Records purchased the catalogue from Arista. In 1986, Malaco Records acquired Savoy&#x27;s black gospel titles and contracts. 

In 1991, Nippon Columbia acquired Savoy and its library, and distributed Savoy releases through its wholly owned subsidiary, Savoy Jazz. In 2003, Savoy Jazz acquired the rights to the Muse and Landmark catalogues from 32 Jazz. In 2009, the label entered a distribution arrangement with Warner Music Group. Savoy included the rock imprint 429 Records.

Many of the label&#x27;s African American artists begrudged the label&#x27;s founder, Herman Lubinsky, feeling underpaid for their work. Tiny Price, a journalist for the African American newspaper &quot;The Newark Herald News&quot;, said of Savoy and Lubinsky:
There&#x27;s no doubt everybody hated Herman Lubinsky. If he messed with you, you were messed. At the same time, some of those people, many of them Newark&#x27;s top singers and musicians, would never have been exposed on records if he didn&#x27;t do what he did. Except for Lubinsky, all the hot little numbers, like Buddy Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Cherry&quot;, would have been lost. The man may have been hated, but he saved a lot of our history for us and for future generations.

Savoy&#x27;s artistic directors included Buck Ram, Teddy Reig, Ralph Bass (1948–1952), Fred Mendelsohn (1953), and Ozzie Cadena (1954–1962).

==Discography==
&quot;The following are 12&quot; LPs and have the prefix MG.&quot;
==Subsidiaries==
* Acorn Records (1949‒51)
* Gospel Records (1958–early 1970s)
* Regent Records (1947‒64)
* Sharp Records (1960‒64)

<doc id="327234" wikidata="Q138130" url="?curid=327234" title="Gungrave">
<text>is a 2002 Japanese third-person shooter video game developed and published by Red Entertainment (Sega in North America and Activision in Europe) for the PlayStation 2. &quot;Gungrave&quot; follows its main character through a variety of stages on a path of revenge.

While the gameplay received moderate reviews, &quot;Gungrave&quot; received acclaim for the character designs provided by series creator Yasuhiro Nightow (&quot;Trigun&quot;) and mechanical designs provided by Kōsuke Fujishima (&quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; series, &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot; series, &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series). Both artists&#x27; respective styles helped give the game a distinct feel, which (along with fan support) helped &quot;Gungrave&quot; translate from a video game to an anime series as well as a video game sequel for the PlayStation 2 entitled &quot;&quot; in 2004. Cinematics were provided by &quot;Ikusabune Co., Ltd.&quot;, which developed the sequel with Red Entertainment&#x27;s supervision.

==Gameplay==
As a third-person shooter, &quot;Gungrave&quot; focuses on combat. The player advances through hallway-like stages, but has a free range of motion in these areas. The player confronts wave after wave of fighters en route to an end-level boss. Combat varies between gunplay with enemies at a distance and simple melee combat at close range, and the game rates the amount of flair the player uses to destroy everyone and everything in sight.

Players control Beyond the Grave, who is equipped with a damage-absorbing energy shield that can absorb a large amount of damage in addition to his life bar. This shield appears as a blue bar alongside Beyond the Grave&#x27;s life bar in the game&#x27;s heads-up display. When the shield is fully depleted, the player is highly vulnerable and further damage reduces the character&#x27;s health level rapidly. However, the shield will recharge fully if no damage is sustained for a brief period of time.

By performing well during stages, the player can unlock special attacks such as machine guns or rockets launched from the coffin on Beyond the Grave&#x27;s back. These can be used by charging the beat meter which is represented by a skull on the top left corner of the game&#x27;s heads-up display. To build the beat meter, Beyond the Grave must perform combos sometimes numbering in hundreds of hits (destroying enemies or practically anything in the game environment). Strategy is required in setting up combos that are as long and devastating as possible, which helps to carry on the over-the-top action of the game.

Stages and some important events within stages are separated by anime cutscenes featuring art by Nightow. This is where the game&#x27;s story takes place. Characters are expanded on and the player is given a back-story that is not obvious through gameplay alone.

==Story==
===Setting===
The game takes place in an unknown city that is controlled by the Millennion organization. The city is overrun by crime and a mysterious drug known as seed. The story follows Grave as he sets out on a course for revenge against the man who killed him, his former best friend and colleague from Millenion, Harry Macdowell.

Stages in the game are presented as missions issued by Dr. T, and follow Grave as he hunts down the boss of that stage. Settings include a bar, a lab, the subway, and even a traditional Japanese dojo set atop a sky scraper. These environments are complemented or contrasted by the urban environment that surrounds them.

===Plot===

The game opens with the young girl dragging an oversized attaché case toward a warehouse with difficulty. &quot;Bloody&quot; Harry Macdowell has just carried out a coup against Big Daddy, the leader of the Millennion organization, and his daughter Mika needs to find someone that can protect her and stop Harry&#x27;s mad plans. The occupants of this warehouse include a kindly looking old doctor, and a man with a notable scar on his face. Mika arrives, and the man with the scar claims the contents of the case: two massive handguns. That man is revealed to be the game&#x27;s title character Grave, and now that he is armed he can start his mission.

Gungrave first approaches its stages as a series of missions issued by Dr. T, first to gather information on the current makeup of Millennion from a low-level street gang, and next destroying a research facility that creates Harry&#x27;s undead soldiers. In the third stage, while attempting to pump information from an informant, Grave comes into contact with the leadership of the Millenion organization—once friends and allies that he now faces as enemies. Each have used the research Harry supported to give themselves inhuman powers. From here on, Grave is hounded by each member as he makes his way to Harry&#x27;s tower at the heart of the city.

As the player progresses, the game uses anime cutscenes to reflect on the history of young Brandon and Harry, gradually bringing the pair&#x27;s back story into focus. Close friends, the two had both become lieutenants in the Millennion organization, working directly under Big Daddy, the group&#x27;s leader. Brandon shared a bond with Big Daddy and some flashbacks show the two sharing more of a father-son relationship. Brandon even let Big Daddy marry the woman he loved so that she could find a better life, but the two remained close. Not content with the power he had been given, Harry asked Brandon to help him kill Big Daddy so that he could take over. When Brandon refused, Harry shot his friend in the left eye, killing him. Fifteen years later, Harry carried out his coup. His actions as leader inspired Dr. T to revive Brandon who was the only person capable of stopping Harry. Dr. T&#x27;s connection to all of this is not made clear, but he often makes comments that indicate some connection to Brandon&#x27;s former life.

Grave picks apart the leadership of Millennion to make his way to Harry. At the top of the tower that Harry uses as a headquarters, it is revealed that Big Daddy still lives in the form of a twisted monster. Harry forces Grave to fight his creation, and following the final battle, Harry accepts his defeat graciously and allows his friend to kill him.

With Harry defeated, Mika&#x27;s protection becomes Grave&#x27;s only concern, and to keep his promise to Big Daddy of protecting the family, Grave protects Mika while they drive away from this tragedy.

==Development==

Beyond the Grave was created by manga artist Yasuhiro Nightow. During a convention in America he was approached by game developer Red Entertainment, who asked if there was a certain type of game Ihe was interested in making. In creating Grave, Nightow elaborated wanted him to be a silent person as he does not enjoy games where the main character talks too much. Nightow explained further influences in the making of the character and believed he was satisfied with the final result. He created Grave from his backside due to how the game would be designed and never thought about how hard it would be to animate him. When the &quot;Gungrave&quot; anime was released, Nightow noted the issues he made and made a brief plot summary for the staff. Nightow also took a liking to Grave&#x27;s younger persona, Brandon Heat, being excited in a convention when he met a cosplayer of him. In &quot;&quot; the developers wanted to keep showing people Beyond the Grave, as &quot;just how great&quot; he is based on response from the original game. The character is voiced in Japanese by Tomokazu Seki and Kirk Thornton in English.&lt;

The game was inspired by multiple action films, most notably those by John Woo. The gameplay was developed in order to be unique rather than a typical action game. Character designer Nightow was attending a convention in the United States and was approached by Red Entertainment during conception of the game which highly influenced their title.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Critical reception to Beyond the Grave has been mixed in his introduction. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; regarded him as a &quot;true hero&quot; due to the skills he possesses, something the players would like control while describing him as an &quot;arthritic Frankenstein&quot; due to experiments have affected his nearly dead body. Nevertheless, his narrative was found common due to his journey to defeat mafia members with supernatural powers. &quot;GameSpot&quot; drew a similar statement, considering his looks as mix between &quot;cowboy and a vampire&quot; while still keeping a stylish look and liking his interactions with Mika. &quot;IGN&quot; enjoyed his main design, comparing it with Nightow&#x27;s&quot; Trigun&quot; manga but more gothic and laballed him as &quot;cool&quot; due to the intense firepower he displays. In another review, &quot;IGN&quot; described Grave as &quot;the one notably detailed character model on screen at any given time, since most of the cannon fodder are given comparatively short shrift in the modeling department&quot; and lamented his lack of more diverse moves. In a further analysis of the game while detailing the revenge story arcs as common in fiction, GameSpy found there is a common misinterpretation of Grave as an anti-hero but instead is portrayed as &quot;the reformed gangster, whose loyalty and caring feelings toward those he loves gives him a type of nobility that allows him to somewhat transcend his bloodthirsty one-man war.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; enjoyed the character, but describing him as a &quot;low-rent Max Payne&quot;.

== Sequels ==
Two years later, &quot;&quot; was released and adds new playable characters to the series and a new story.

In 2017, Korean developers Iggymob and Blueside, under the supervision of Red Entertainment, revived the &quot;Gungrave&quot; series and released &quot;Gungrave VR&quot; for the PlayStation VR in late 2017 in Japan and late 2018 in North America and Europe. &quot;Gungrave VR&quot; serves as a prologue to a new sequel titled, &quot;Gungrave G.O.R.E&quot; (&quot;Gunslinger of REsurrection&quot;), which was released on November 22, 2022 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.

<doc id="327236" wikidata="Q11964951" url="?curid=327236" title="New Monarchs">
<text>The New Monarchs is a concept developed by European historians during the first half of the 20th century to characterize 15th-century European rulers who unified their respective nations, creating stable and centralized governments. This centralization allowed for an era of worldwide colonization and conquest in the 16th century, and paved the way for rapid economic growth in Europe. Many historians argue the Military Revolution made possible, and indeed made necessary, formation of strong central governments in order to maximize military strength that could enable conquest and prevent being conquered.

==Examples==
The best examples of New Monarchs are, chronologically:

*John I of Portugal — terminated the political anarchy and began the Portuguese period of discoveries
* John II of Portugal crushed the power of the Nobility, establishing the preeminence of the Crown
*Charles VII of France — ended civil disputes
*Louis XI of France — united France as it recovered from the Hundred Years War
*Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon — They never combined their territory. Each always ruled their own lands independently, weakened the power of the nobility, completed the Reconquista, reformed the state finances, the law, the church, and the army and began the age of Spanish exploration. They also outlawed all religions except Catholicism. 
*Henry VII of England — ended the War of the Roses and pacified Yorkist resistance by marrying Elizabeth of York

==Achievements==
The achievements of the New Monarchs:

*Limiting the power of the feudal aristocracy
*Creating efficient, centralized systems of taxation
*Maintaining a standing army loyal to the monarch
*Encouraging some sense of national identity (but by no means nationalism yet)
*Fostering trade, both internally and externally
*Enforcing religious unity within their countries

While Peter the Great ruled two centuries after the New Monarchs, he is sometimes considered the New Monarch of Russia, accomplishing for his country very much what the New Monarchs did for theirs.

After the New Monarchs, the Absolutist Monarchs gained sway, to be followed by the Enlightened Absolutism.

==History==
New Monarchies, which were very powerful centralized governments with unified inhabitants, began to emerge in the mid-15th century. Factors responsible for this advance were the vast demographic and economic growth. Before these New Monarchies were formed, there were many changes the new monarchs had to make: including weakening powerful rivals, increasing revenue, unifying the country, and strengthening the power of the king and his bureaucracy. Two countries successful in strengthening themselves were France and England. England was headed by Henry VII and his son Henry VIII of the Tudor dynasty; France was headed by Louis XI, Louis XII and Francis I of the Valois dynasty. 

===Causes===
Many factors were responsible for the New Monarchies&#x27; rise from the years 1450-1550. First, there was a huge increase in population of 50%; thus there were more people paying the king&#x27;s taxes. This led economic growth, as the increase in demand stimulated the economy. People began taking bigger risks and forming partnerships, enabling large sums of money to be invested. People became wealthier, resulting in a greater consumption of goods and luxuries, making merchants and traders wealthy. Merchants were then paying larger amounts in tariffs, increasing the king&#x27;s revenue.

To create and sustain a new monarchy kings had to introduce many changes. In the early 15th century there was political fragmentation, as some countries were not unified and there were many separate rulers governing small areas. At that time the nobility and the church rose to be the thriving powers. The king had to make changes to unify and strengthen his monarchy. He would have to weaken his rivals, the church and nobility, and transfer the authority to himself. He would also have to increase his funding by either increasing taxes, or selling government offices. Many kings did both.

===Actions taken===
The rulers of England and France both had to weaken their rivals, the church and nobility, in order to centralise power to the crown. In England, Henry VII came to power by decisively winning the Wars of the Roses, fought between his mother&#x27;s family, the House of Lancaster, and their rivals, the House of York. The Lancastrian and Tudor forces defeated the powerful House of York, led by Henry Tudor (later Henry VII), whose descent from the House of Lancaster gave him legitimacy among the Lancastrian army. Henry then ascended to the throne after the Battle of Bosworth Field, and unified the two warring houses in his marriage to Elizabeth of York, thereby weakening the potential for opposition from the strongest noble families on both sides of the conflict, and making it much easier to centralise power away from the nobility. 

Moreover, so many nobles had died during the Wars of the Roses that Henry VII came to the throne with a total of 73 peers in England, and a further 16 in Ireland, so there was a lack of power among the wider nobility to challenge his rule even if they had wanted to. Henry VII hired the gentry, the class below nobility, to serve as Justices of Peace, who enforce the king&#x27;s law and collect taxes; this weakened the power of nobility and made sure the king&#x27;s laws were followed. He also increased the power of his royal court, the Star Chamber, giving them cases that previously went to nobility: thus increasing his own power over the judicial system.

France had more difficulty in weakening its nobles and centralising power. Before the mid-1400s the aristocrats were very powerful, serving as independent rulers with their own laws and courts. Frances I sold offices in government, many of which come with a title. This increased the number of men in the class of nobles enabling Frances to dilute the aristocracy with men loyal to him. 

These two countries had very separate methods of dealing with the problem of the church and its power. Henry VIII, under the advice of Thomas Cromwell, decided to break off from the Catholic church and start his own religion, the Anglican church. Francis I, on the other hand, decided on a more simplistic approach and forces the pope to sign the Concordat of Bologna in 1516, which gave the king power to appoint whomever he wants for bishops and other religious positions and lessened the power of the papacy. 
Both kings needed to increase revenue. France needed more capital than England because of its permanent army of 15,000 soldiers, which cost half of the king&#x27;s revenue. Both countries improved tax collection by preventing people from evading taxes. Henry VII concocted numerous schemes to increase his revenue. Since he needed Parliament&#x27;s consent to could increase taxes, he increased fines for criminals. This had the dual effect of decreasing crime and increasing his treasury. Furthermore, he sold monopolies, which fetched large sums because those in possession could sell their products at any price, without fear of competition. France had a slightly different way of doing things; Frances I sold positions of government, and centralized tax collection under one agency. With one agency heading the collection, fewer people were able to evade taxes. France also instituted new taxes.
===Results===
Though stabilizing New Monarchies was not easy, it proved to be very worthwhile. After Henry VIII and Francis I, wars began for England and France, England&#x27;s northern rising and France&#x27;s civil war. Both countries are able to pull through because of the strength invested during the New Monarchies. Additionally the strength formed during England&#x27;s New Monarchies helped withstand the fragile reigns of Edward and Mary, who followed after Henry VIII.

<text>The National Primitive Baptist Convention, USA is a group of Black Primitive Baptists that has adopted progressive methods and policies not in keeping with the historical and theological background of Primitive Baptists in general. The Convention was organized in Huntsville, Alabama in 1907. These churches have adopted the use of instrumental music, Sunday Schools, revivals and church auxiliaries. The idea of a national convention is itself foreign to standard Primitive Baptist concepts. They still adhere the Calvinistic or Predestinarian teachings held by other Primitive Baptists, but in a more progressive manner and are similar to the black National Baptist Conventions. The NPBC churches continue with Primitive Baptist usage in retaining the observance of feet washing as an ordinance of the church, and in calling their ministers &quot;elder.&quot; These churches are not in fellowship with the remaining &quot;old school&quot; white Primitive Baptists. Most of the &quot;National Primitive Baptist Convention&quot; churches (616 in 1995) are located in the southern United States.

<text>The Upper West Side (UWS) is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. It is bounded by Central Park on the east, the Hudson River on the west, West 59th Street to the south, and West 110th Street to the north. The Upper West Side is adjacent to the neighborhoods of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen to the south, Columbus Circle to the southeast, and Morningside Heights to the north.

Like the Upper East Side opposite Central Park, the Upper West Side is an affluent, primarily residential area with many of its residents working in commercial areas of Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Similarly to the Museum Mile district on the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side is considered one of Manhattan&#x27;s cultural and intellectual hubs, with Columbia University and Barnard College located just to the north of the neighborhood, the American Museum of Natural History located near its center, the New York Institute of Technology in the Columbus Circle proximity and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School located at the south end.

The Upper West Side is part of Manhattan Community District 7, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10023, 10024, 10025, and 10069. It is patrolled by the 20th and 24th Precincts of the New York City Police Department.

==Geography==
The Upper West Side is bounded on the south by 59th Street, Central Park to the east, the Hudson River to the west, and 110th Street to the north. The area north of West 96th Street and east of Broadway is also identified as Manhattan Valley. The overlapping area west of Amsterdam Avenue to Riverside Park was once known as the Bloomingdale District.

From west to east, the avenues of the Upper West Side are Riverside Drive, West End Avenue (11th Avenue), Broadway, Amsterdam Avenue (10th Avenue), Columbus Avenue (9th Avenue), and Central Park West (8th Avenue). The 66-block stretch of Broadway forms the spine of the neighborhood and runs diagonally north–south across the other avenues at the south end of the neighborhood; above 78th Street Broadway runs north parallel to the other avenues. Broadway enters the neighborhood at its juncture with Central Park West at Columbus Circle (59th Street), crosses Columbus Avenue at Lincoln Square (65th Street), Amsterdam Avenue at Verdi Square (71st Street), and then merges with West End Avenue at Straus Park (aka Bloomingdale Square, at 107th Street).

Traditionally the neighborhood ranged from the former village of Harsenville, centered on the old Bloomingdale Road (now Broadway) and 65th Street, west to the railroad yards along the Hudson, then north to 110th Street, where the ground rises to Morningside Heights. With the construction of Lincoln Center, its name, though perhaps not the reality, was stretched south to 58th Street. With the arrival of the corporate headquarters and expensive condos of the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, and the Riverside South apartment complex built by Donald Trump, the area from 58th Street to 65th Street is increasingly referred to as Lincoln Square by realtors who acknowledge a different tone and ambiance than that typically associated with the Upper West Side. This is a reversion to the neighborhood&#x27;s historical name.

==History==

===Native American and colonial use===

The long high bluff above useful sandy coves along the North River was little used or traversed by the Lenape people. A combination of the stream valleys, such as that in which 96th Street runs, and wetlands to the northeast and east, may have protected a portion of the Upper West Side from the Lenape&#x27;s controlled burns; lack of periodic ground fires results in a denser understory and more fire-intolerant trees, such as American Beech.

In the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the Upper West Side-to-be contained some of colonial New York&#x27;s most ambitious houses, spaced along Bloomingdale Road. It became increasingly infilled with smaller, more suburban villas in the first half of the nineteenth century, and in the middle of the century, parts had become decidedly lower class.

===Bloomingdale District===
The name &quot;Bloomingdale District&quot; was used to refer to a part of the Upper West Side – the present-day Manhattan Valley neighborhood – located between 96th and 110th Streets and bounded on the east by Amsterdam Avenue and on the west by Riverside Drive, Riverside Park, and the Hudson River.

Its name was a derivation of the description given to the area by Dutch settlers to New Netherland, likely from Bloemendaal, a town in the tulip region. The name was Anglicized to &quot;Bloomingdale&quot; or &quot;the Bloomingdale District&quot;, covering the west side of Manhattan from about 23rd Street up to the Hollow Way (modern 125th Street). It consisted of farms and villages along a road (regularized in 1703) known as the Bloomingdale Road. Bloomingdale Road was renamed The Boulevard in 1868, as the farms and villages were divided into building lots and absorbed into the city. By the 18th century it contained numerous farms and country residences of many of the city&#x27;s well-off, a major parcel of which was the Apthorp Farm. The main artery of this area was the Bloomingdale Road, which began north of where Broadway and the Bowery Lane (now Fourth Avenue) join (at modern Union Square) and wended its way northward up to about modern 116th Street in Morningside Heights, where the road further north was known as the Kingsbridge Road. Within the confines of the modern-day Upper West Side, the road passed through areas known as Harsenville, Strycker&#x27;s Bay, and Bloomingdale Village.

With the building of the Croton Aqueduct passing down the area between present day Amsterdam Avenue and Columbus Avenue in 1838–42, the northern reaches of the district became divided into Manhattan Valley to the east of the aqueduct and Bloomingdale to the west. Bloomingdale, in the latter half of the 19th century, was the name of a village that occupied the area just south of 110th Street.

===Late 19th-century development===
Much of the riverfront of the Upper West Side was a shipping, transportation, and manufacturing corridor. The Hudson River Railroad line right-of-way was granted in the late 1830s to connect New York City to Albany, and soon ran along the riverbank. One major non-industrial development, the creation of Central Park in the 1850s and &#x27;60s, caused many squatters to move their shacks into the Upper West Side. Parts of the neighborhood became a ragtag collection of squatters&#x27; housing, boarding houses, and rowdy taverns.

As this development occurred, the old name of Bloomingdale Road was being chopped away and the name Broadway was progressively applied further northward to include what had been lower Bloomingdale Road. In 1868, the city began straightening and grading the section of the Bloomingdale Road from Harsenville north, and it became known as &quot;Western Boulevard&quot; or &quot;The Boulevard&quot;. It retained that name until the end of the century, when the name Broadway finally supplanted it.

Development of the neighborhood lagged even while Central Park was being laid out in the 1860s and &#x27;70s, then was stymied by the Panic of 1873. Things turned around with the introduction of the Ninth Avenue elevated in the 1870s along Ninth Avenue (renamed Columbus Avenue in 1890), and with Columbia University&#x27;s relocation to Morningside Heights in the 1890s, using lands once held by the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum.

Riverside Park was conceived in 1866 and formally approved by the state legislature through the efforts of city parks commissioner Andrew Haswell Green. The first segment of park was acquired through condemnation in 1872, and construction soon began following a design created by the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed the adjacent, gracefully curving Riverside Drive. In 1937, under the administration of commissioner Robert Moses, of land were added to the park, primarily by creating a promenade that covered the tracks of the Hudson River Railroad. Moses, working with landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke also added playgrounds, and distinctive stonework and the 79th Street Boat Basin, but also cut pedestrians off from direct access to most of the riverfront by building the Henry Hudson Parkway by the river&#x27;s edge. According to Robert Caro&#x27;s book on Moses, &quot;The Power Broker&quot;, Riverside Park was designed with most of the amenities located in predominantly white neighborhoods, with the neighborhoods closer to Harlem getting shorter shrift. Riverside Park, like Central Park, underwent a revival late in the 20th century, largely through the efforts of the Riverside Park Fund, a citizen&#x27;s group. Largely through their efforts and the support of the city, much of the park has been improved. The Hudson River Greenway along the river-edge of the park is a common route for pedestrians and bicyclists; an extension to the park&#x27;s greenway runs between 83rd and 91st Streets on a promenade in the river itself.

===Early 20th century===

====Subway expansion====

1868 saw the opening of the now demolished IRT Ninth Avenue Line – the city&#x27;s first elevated railway – which opened in the decade following the American Civil War. The Upper West Side experienced a building boom from 1885 to 1910, thanks in large part to the 1904 opening of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which comprised, in part, what is now a portion of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, with subway stations at 59th, 66th, 72nd, 79th, 86th, 91st, 96th, 103rd, 110th, 116th, and 125th Streets.This further stimulated residential development of the area. The stately tall apartment blocks on West End Avenue and the townhouses on the streets between Amsterdam Avenue and Riverside Drive, which contribute to the character of the area, were all constructed during the pre-depression years of the twentieth century. A revolution in building techniques, the low cost of land relative to lower Manhattan, the arrival of the subway, and the popularization of the formerly expensive elevator made it possible to construct large apartment buildings for the middle classes. The large scale and style of these buildings is one reason why the neighborhood has remained largely unchanged into the twenty-first century.

The neighborhood changed from the 1930s to the 1950s. In 1932, the IND Eighth Avenue Line opened under Central Park West. In 1940, the elevated IRT Ninth Avenue Line over Columbus Avenue closed. Immigrants from Eastern Europe and the Caribbean moved in during the &#x27;50s and the &#x27;60s. The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts opened in the 1960s. 
The early 20th century marked the beginning of a significant Jewish presence on the Upper West Side. By 1930, Jewish residents constituted approximately one-third of the population living between West 79th and West 110th Streets, from Broadway to the Hudson River. 

====Enclaves====
In the 1900s, the area south of 67th Street was heavily populated by African-Americans and supposedly gained its nickname of &quot;San Juan Hill&quot; in commemoration of African-American soldiers who were a major part of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s assault on Cuba&#x27;s San Juan Hill in the Spanish–American War. By 1960, it was a rough neighborhood of tenement housing, the demolition of which was delayed to allow for exterior shots in the film musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Thereafter, urban renewal brought the construction of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Lincoln Towers apartments during 1962–1968.

The Upper West Side is a significant Jewish neighborhood, populated with both German Jews who moved in at the turn of last century, and Jewish refugees escaping Hitler&#x27;s Europe in the 1930s. Today the area between 85th Street and 100th Street is home to the largest community of young Modern Orthodox singles outside of Israel. However, the Upper West Side also features a substantial number of non-Orthodox Jews. A number of major synagogues are located in the neighborhood, including the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States, Shearith Israel; New York&#x27;s second-oldest and the third-oldest Ashkenazi synagogue, B&#x27;nai Jeshurun; Rodeph Sholom; the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue; and numerous others such as the Jewish Center, and West Side Institutional.

===Late 20th-century urban renewal===

From the post-WWII years until the AIDS epidemic, the neighborhood, especially below 86th Street, had a substantial gay population. As the neighborhood had deteriorated, it was affordable to working class gay men, and those just arriving in the city and looking for their first white collar jobs. Its ethnically mixed gay population, mostly Hispanic and white, with a mixture of income levels and occupations patronized the same gay bars in the neighborhood, making it markedly different from most gay enclaves elsewhere in the city. The influx of white gay men in the Fifties and Sixties is often credited with accelerating the gentrification of the Upper West Side.

In a subsequent phase of urban renewal, the rail yards which had formed the Upper West Side&#x27;s southwest corner were replaced by the Riverside South residential project, which included a southward extension of Riverside Park. The evolution of Riverside South had a 40-year history, often extremely bitter, beginning in 1962 when the New York Central Railroad, in partnership with the Amalgamated Lithographers Union, proposed a mixed-use development with 12,000 apartments, Litho City, to be built on platforms over the tracks. The subsequent bankruptcy of the enlarged, but short-lived Penn Central Railroad brought other proposals and prospective developers. The one generating the most opposition was Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;Television City&quot; concept of 1985, which would have included a 152-story office tower and six 75-story residential buildings. In 1991, a coalition of civic organizations proposed a purely residential development of about half that size, and then reached a deal with Trump.

The community&#x27;s links to the events of September 11, 2001 were evinced in Upper West Side resident and Pulitzer Prize winner David Halberstam&#x27;s paean to the men of Ladder Co 40/Engine Co 35, just a few blocks from his home, in his book &quot;Firehouse&quot;.

Today, this area is the site for several long-established charitable institutions; their unbroken parcels of land have provided suitably scaled sites for Columbia University and the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, as well as for some vanished landmarks, such as the Schwab Mansion on Riverside Drive.

The name Bloomingdale is still used in reference to a part of the Upper West Side, essentially the location of old Bloomingdale Village, the area from about 96th Street up to 110th Street and from Riverside Park east to Amsterdam Avenue. The triangular block bound by Broadway, West End Avenue, 106th Street and 107th Street, although generally known as Straus Park (named for Isidor Straus and his wife Ida), was officially designated Bloomingdale Square in 1907. The neighborhood also includes the Bloomingdale School of Music and Bloomingdale neighborhood branch of the New York Public Library. Adjacent to the Bloomingdale neighborhood is a more diverse and less affluent subsection of the Upper West Side called Manhattan Valley, focused on the downslope of Columbus Avenue and Manhattan Avenue from about 96th Street up to 110th Street.

==Demographics==

For census purposes, the New York City government classifies the Upper West Side as part of two neighborhood tabulation areas: Upper West Side (up to 105th Street) and Lincoln Square (down to 58th Street), divided by 74th Street. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the combined population of the Upper West Side was 193,867, a change of 1,674 (0.9%) from the 192,193 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 69.5% (134,735) White, 7.1% (13,856) African American, 0.1% (194) Native American, 7.6% (14,804) Asian, 0% (48) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (620) from other races, and 2% (3,828) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.3% (25,782) of the population.

The racial composition of the Upper West Side changed moderately from 2000 to 2010, with the greatest changes being the increase in the Asian population by 38% (4,100), the decrease in the Black population by 15% (2,435), and the increase in the Hispanic / Latino population by 8% (2,147). The White population remained the majority, experiencing a slight increase of 2% (2,098), while the small population of all other races experienced a negligible increase of 1% (58). Taking into account the two census tabulation areas, the overall decreases in the Black and Hispanic / Latino populations were concentrated in the Upper West Side area, with the Hispanic / Latino population actually increasing by a smaller margin in Lincoln Square. On the other hand, the increases in the White and Asian populations were mostly in Lincoln Center, especially the White population.The entirety of Community District 7, which comprises the Upper West Side from 59th Street to 110th Street, had 214,744 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 84.7 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most residents are adults: a plurality (34%) are between the ages of 25–44, while 27% are between 45 and 64, and 18% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 15% and 5% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 7 was $123,894. In 2018, an estimated 9% of Upper West Side residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty residents (5%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 40% in the Upper West Side, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 7 is not considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was not low-income in 1990.

== Political representation ==

The Upper West Side is part of Manhattan Community District 7. Politically, the Upper West Side is in New York&#x27;s 12th congressional district. It is in the New York State Senate&#x27;s 30th and 47th districts, the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 67th, 69th, and 75th districts, and the New York City Council&#x27;s 6th and 7th districts.

===Other sites===
* 27 West 67th Street - Artists&#x27; studio cooperative built in 1901, anchor for the West 67th Street Artists&#x27; Colony Historic District.
* American Youth Hostel – the transformation of this abandoned Richard Morris Hunt landmark into the flagship of Hostelling International USA was propelled forward by the federal Community Development Block Grant funded, Manhattan Valley Neighborhood Strategy Area designation.
* Apple Bank Building – formerly Central Savings Bank, a Florentine palazzo at Broadway and 73rd, with a Roman banking hall, one of New York&#x27;s classic interior spaces, York &amp; Sawyer, architects, ironwork by Samuel Yellin, 1928. The upper floors have been converted to luxury condominium apartments.
* Claremont Riding Academy – In 2007, after 115 years of use, the last public stables in Manhattan, this National Register building on 89th Street, just east of Amsterdam, closed its doors for good. The subsequent interior gutting for conversion to residential use has halted.
* Columbus Circle – Traffic circle at the intersection of Broadway, Central Park West and Eighth Avenue, and Central Park South. Its centerpiece is a statue of the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus erected in 1906. Two other similarly financed monuments on Broadway include those to Italian writer Dante Aligheri in Dante Park between 63rd and 64th Streets at Columbus Avenue (which now heralds Lincoln Center); and to Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi which anchors Verdi Square, girded by 72nd and 73rd Streets at Amsterdam Avenue.

The model for the sculpture was also the muse for the Maine Monument, 57 blocks south on Broadway, at the Columbus Circle entrance to Central Park.

===Residences===

The apartment buildings along Central Park West, facing the park, are some of the city&#x27;s most opulent. The Dakota at 72nd Street has been home to numerous celebrities including John Lennon, Leonard Bernstein, and Lauren Bacall. Other buildings on CPW include four twin-towered structures: the Century and Majestic by Irwin Chanin, the Orwell House by the firm of Mulliken and Moeller, and the San Remo and El Dorado by Emery Roth. Roth also designed the Beresford, the Alden, and the Ardsley on Central Park West. His first major commission, the Belle Époque-style Belleclaire Hotel, is on Broadway, while the moderne-style Normandy stands on Riverside at 86th Street. Along Broadway are several large apartment houses, including the Belnord (1908), the Apthorp (1908), the Ansonia (1902), the Dorilton (1902), and the Manhasset. All are individually designated New York City landmarks.

The serpentine Riverside Drive also has many pre-war houses and larger buildings, while West End Avenue is lined with pre-war Beaux-Arts apartment buildings and townhouses dating from the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Columbus Avenue north of 87th Street was the spine for major post-World War II urban renewal. Broadway is lined with such architecturally notable apartment buildings as The Ansonia, The Apthorp, The Belnord, the Astor Court Building, and The Cornwall, which features an Art Nouveau cornice. Newly constructed 15 Central Park West and 535 West End Avenue are among some of the prestigious residential addresses in Manhattan.

===Restaurants and gourmet groceries===

Both Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue from 67th Street up to 110th Street are lined with restaurants and bars, as is Columbus Avenue to a slightly lesser extent. The following lists a few prominent ones:
* Barney Greengrass, specializing in fish at Amsterdam Avenue and 86th Street; featured in the 2011 film &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot;. It marked its centenary in June 2008.
* Citarella Gourmet Market (flagship store), specializing in seafood, meats and gourmet packaged foods located at 75th Street
* The Howard Chandler Christie murals of Café des Artistes, a now-closed French restaurant on West 67th Street off Central Park West, are being incorporated into a new restaurant on the site.
* Cafe Lalo, dessert and coffee venue at 83rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue, opened in 1988 and featured in the 1998 movie &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;.
* Community Food and Juice, an eco-conscious restaurant at 2893 Broadway between 112th and 113th Streets.
* A branch of Gray&#x27;s Papaya, which specializes in hot dogs, is located at Broadway and 72nd Street.
* The original Zabar&#x27;s is a specialty food and housewares store at Broadway and 80th Street.
* Levana&#x27;s, a kosher, fine dining restaurant was part of the neighborhood for three decades, but closed in the 2000s.
* Tom&#x27;s Restaurant located on the ground floor of the Columbia University&#x27;s Armstrong Hall at 2880 Broadway on the northeast corner of 112nd Street, was used as the outside location for the fictional Monk&#x27;s Cafe in the NBC show &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

==Police and crime==
The Upper West Side is patrolled by two precincts of the NYPD. The 20th Precinct is located at 120 West 82nd Street and serves the part of the neighborhood south of 86th Street, while the 24th Precinct is located at 151 West 100th Street and serves the part of the neighborhood north of 86th Street.

The 20th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 95.5% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported 0 murders, 14 rapes, 116 robberies, 102 felony assaults, 136 burglaries, 877 grand larcenies, and 75 grand larcenies auto in 2022. Of the five major violent felonies (murder, rape, felony assault, robbery, and burglary), the 20th Precinct had a rate of 250 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2019, compared to the boroughwide average of 632 crimes per 100,000 and the citywide average of 572 crimes per 100,000.

The 24th Precinct also has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 94.1% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported 1 murder, 9 rapes, 150 robberies, 188 felony assaults, 180 burglaries, 526 grand larcenies, and 89 grand larcenies auto in 2022. Of the five major violent felonies (murder, rape, felony assault, robbery, and burglary), the 24th Precinct had a rate of 414 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2019, compared to the boroughwide average of 632 crimes per 100,000 and the citywide average of 572 crimes per 100,000.

, Manhattan Community District 7 has a non-fatal assault hospitalization rate of 25 per 100,000 people, compared to the boroughwide rate of 49 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 59 per 100,000. Its incarceration rate is 211 per 100,000 people, compared to the boroughwide rate of 407 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 425 per 100,000.

In 2019, the highest concentration of felony assaults and robberies in the Upper West Side was on Columbus Avenue between 100th Street and 104th Street (going through the Frederick Douglass Houses), where there were 24 felony assaults and 15 robberies. The area around the intersection of 72nd Street and Broadway also had 14 robberies in 2019.

==Fire safety==
The Upper West Side is served by multiple New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire stations:
* Engine Company 40/Ladder Company 35 – 131 Amsterdam Avenue 
* Ladder Company 25/Division 3/Collapse Rescue 1 – 205 West 77th Street 
* Engine Company 74 – 120 West 83rd Street 
* Engine Company 76/Ladder Company 22/Battalion 11 – 145 West 100th Street

==Health==
, preterm births and births to teenage mothers in the Upper West Side are lower than the city average.

<text>King You of Zhou (795–771 BC), personal name Ji Gongsheng, was a king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty and the last from the Western Zhou dynasty. He reigned from 781 to 771 BC.

==History==
In 780 BC, a major earthquake struck Guanzhong. A soothsayer named Bo Yangfu () considered this an omen foretelling the destruction of the Zhou Dynasty.

In 779 BC, a concubine named Bao Si entered the palace and came into the King You&#x27;s favour. They had a son named Bofu. King You deposed and Crown Prince Yijiu. He made Baosi the new queen and Bofu the new crown prince.

Queen Shen&#x27;s father, the Marquess of Shen, was furious at the deposition of his daughter and grandson Crown Prince Yijiu and mounted an attack on King You&#x27;s palace with the Quanrong. King You called for his nobles using the previously abused beacons but none came. In the end, King You and Bofu were killed and Baosi was captured.

After King You died, nobles including the Marquess of Shen, the Marquess of Zeng () and supported the deposed Prince Yijiu as King Ping of Zhou to continue the Zhou Dynasty. As the national capital Haojing had suffered severe damage, and was located near the potentially dangerous Quanrong, in 771 BC, King Ping of Zhou moved the capital eastward to Luoyang, thus beginning the Eastern Zhou dynasty and ushering in the Spring and Autumn period which would last for more than 300 years.

== In literature ==
In the traditional Mao Commentary to the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, the minor court hymn &quot;Gather the Beans&quot; () is said to be a criticism of King You for squandering feudal lords&#x27; respect and humiliating them. Even so, this interpretation is disputed.

The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; states that Baosi did not laugh easily. After trying many methods and failing, King You tried to amuse his favorite queen by lighting warning beacons and fooling his nobles into thinking that the Quanrong nomads were about to attack. The nobles arrived at the castle only to find themselves laughed at by Baosi. Even after King You had impressed Baosi, he continued to abuse his use of warning beacons and lost the trust of the nobles. The earliest warning beacons appeared in the Han dynasty, and this story is considered to be fabricated. According the &quot;Xinian&quot;, carried by the excavated Tsinghua Bamboo Slips, King You of Zhou attacked the Marquess of Shen, who allied with the Quanrong to defeat the royal army.

== Family ==
===Queens===
* Queen Shen, of the Jiang clan of Shen (), a daughter of the Marquess of Shen; the mother of Crown Prince Yijiu
===Concubines===
* Bao Si, of the Du lineage of the Qi clan of Bao (791–771 BC), a daughter of Du Bo; married in 779 BC; the mother of Crown Prince Bofu
===Sons===
* Crown Prince Yijiu (; d. 720 BC), ruled as King Ping of Zhou from 770 to 720 BC
* &quot;Crown Prince Bofu&quot; (779–771 BC)

<doc id="327251" wikidata="Q446572" url="?curid=327251" title="Mike Paradinas">
<text>Michael Robert Paradinas (born 26 September 1971), better known by his stage name μ-Ziq (pronounced &quot;music&quot; or mu-zik), is an English electronic musician from Wimbledon, London. He was associated with the electronic style intelligent dance music (IDM) during the 1990s, and recorded on Rephlex Records and Reflective Records. His critically acclaimed 1997 album, &quot;Lunatic Harness&quot;, helped define the drill &#x27;n&#x27; bass subgenre and was also his most successful release, selling over 100,000 copies. Paradinas founded the record label Planet Mu, begun in 1995, where he has championed genres such as juke, IDM and footwork.

==History==

Paradinas was born in Charing Cross and began playing keyboards during the early 1980s, and listened to new wave music such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Heaven 17 and early Human League. He joined a few bands in the mid-1980s, then spent eight years on keyboards for the group Blue Innocence.

During this period, Paradinas had been recording on his own as well with synthesizers and a four-track recorder. In 1992, following a performance at &quot;The Orange&quot; in London, Blue Innocence broke up. Paradinas and the bass player, Francis Naughton, bought sequencing software and re-recorded some of Paradinas&#x27;s older tracks. After the material was played for Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton—the duo behind Global Communication and the heads of Evolution Records—it was to be released; however, recording commitments later forced Pritchard and Middleton to withdraw their agreement. Fortunately for Paradinas, Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin) had also heard the tracks and agreed to release their music on Rephlex Records under the alias μ-Ziq.

Naughton then left μ-Ziq to start Rocket Goldstar. A second album &quot;Bluff Limbo&quot; was scheduled to be released in mid-1994, though only 1000 copies were published. It was re-issued by Rephlex in 1996 after Paradinas served papers on the label. Paradinas&#x27;s first major-label release came later in 1994, after he undertook a remix project for Virgin Records: the remix EP &quot;The Auteurs Vs μ-Ziq&quot; for the britpop band the Auteurs. The remixes Paradinas offered sounded nothing like the original song, a familiar practice for many experimental electronic musicians in those times.

Even though the EP was hardly a high sales success, Virgin signed up Paradinas and gave him his own sublabel, Planet Mu, to release his own work and to develop similar-minded artists. (Paradinas later broke with Virgin and in 1998 established Planet Mu as his own independent label). Written into his own contract was a provision for unlimited recording under different names, and during 1995 Paradinas unveiled three aliases and released many albums within less than a year. The neo-electro music label Clear released his debut single under the alias Tusken Raiders (named after the Star Wars species) early in the year. Clear Records also released the first Paradinas alias album, &quot;Jake Slazenger MakesARacket&quot;, later in 1995. Although they were still audible, the LP ignored the electro influences in favour of some synthesizer figures and the previously unheard influence of jazz-funk. Paradinas continued to release solo albums under the above-mentioned names as well as Gary Moscheles, and a one-time collaboration with Aphex Twin under the Mike &amp; Rich moniker.

In 1997, Paradinas made a style change again, mixing experimental electronic music with drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass, a similar aesthetic path taken by Squarepusher and Aphex Twin. During this year he was also touring with popular musician Björk. Björk inspired the 1999 album &quot;Royal Astronomy&quot;, with its mixture of unusual vocals, strings and breakbeat. All of his albums until 2003 were released in the US on the more mainstream label, Astralwerks.

==Personal life==
Paradinas is married to fellow musician Lara Rix-Martin, with whom he has produced music under the alias Heterotic.

<text>The Gimpo Line is a former freight railway line operated by Korean National Railroad that served Gimpo International Airport, southwest of Seoul. The line was a 9.2 km spur line that terminated near the airport and connected to the Gyeongin Line (Seoul Subway Line 1) at Bucheon Station. The line was opened on August 20, 1951 primarily to transport US military materiel, fuel and munitions and closed on August 10, 1980 due to competition by road freight transport.

<text>James Starley (21 April 1830 – 17 June 1881) was an English inventor and father of the bicycle industry. He was one of the most innovative and successful builders of bicycles and tricycles. His inventions include the differential gear, the perfection of the bicycle chain drive, and the penny-farthing.

==Childhood==
Starley was born in 1830 at Albourne, West Sussex, the son of Daniel Starley, a farmer. He began working on the farm at nine, showing early talent as an inventor by making a rat trap from an umbrella rip and a branch of a willow tree. He ran away from home as a teenager and went to Lewisham, in south London. There he worked as an under-gardener, in his spare time mending watches and creating devices such as a mechanism to allow a duck to get through a hole in a fence, closing a door behind it if a rat tried to follow.

==Adult life==
Starley&#x27;s employer, John Penn, bought a rare and expensive sewing machine. Starley mended it when it broke down and improved the mechanism. Penn knew Josiah Turner, a partner of Newton, Wilson and Company, the makers of the machine, and in 1859 Starley joined its factory in Holborn. Turner and Starley started their own Coventry Sewing Machine Company in Coventry around 1861. Turner&#x27;s nephew brought a new French bone-shaker to the factory in 1868. The company started making bicycles and Coventry soon became the centre of the British bicycle industry.

Velocipedes (cycles) had wheels of increasingly disparate size, with the front growing ever larger than the rear. Notable were the high-wheelers, or penny-farthings, a version of which Starley made with William Hillman. Their Ariel vehicle was all-metal and had wire-spoked wheels, much lighter than wooden-spoke ones. Tangent spokes were patented in 1874. Lever-driven and chain-driven tricycles, often in strange configurations, were also devised for women and couples.

Starley, then aging, found it difficult to ride a tricycle sociable with his son, James, in the other saddle. They could not steer because one was stronger than the other. The historian Edward Lyte wrote: &quot;Each rider of the sociable drove his own big wheel independently, so the course of the machine along the road was rather variable. One day Starley cried &#x27;I have it!&#x27; and dismounted. He sat down to a cup of tea and forthwith invented the differential gear, an important mechanical design concept incorporated, e.g., in the back axle of every rear-wheel drive car. It was a Saturday. At 6am on the Monday the prototype was being made and at 8am Starley was stepping on to the London train to register patent No. 3388,1877.&quot;

==Personal life==

Starley married Jane Todd when he was in his early 20s. Their son, William Starley, and his nephew, John Kemp Starley, also entered the industry and one of the outcomes was the Rover car company.

Starley&#x27;s sons continued manufacturing cycles after his death in 1881 but his nephew John Kemp Starley made more of a mark. It was John Kemp Starley and Sutton who devised the recognisably modern Rover safety bicycle with 26-inch wheels (still a standard size), chain drive, and a diamond-shaped frame (no seat-tube as yet) in 1884, showing it in 1885. The penny-farthing or ordinary cycle was not safe, with a &quot;header&quot; accident an ever-present danger. Others had experimented with chain-driven &quot;safety cycles&quot; but the Rover made its mark to the extent that &quot;Rover&quot; (spelled with a W rather than a V) means &quot;bike&quot; in countries such as Poland.

In due course, motor-driven bicycles became motor-cycles and were followed by motor cars. John Kemp Starley experimented with an electric tri-car around 1888 but the petrol-driven Rover 8hp car was sold in 1904, two years after his death.

Coventry University named a 1950s building after Starley; as of December 2019, it was undergoing demolition as part of a redevelopment program.
What was originally D Block of Coventry Polytechnic was renamed after Starley by Coventry University. Once it was demolished it was replaced by Starley Garden.

<text>The Upper East Side, sometimes abbreviated UES, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, bounded approximately by 96th Street to the north, the East River to the east, 59th Street to the south, and Central Park and Fifth Avenue to the west. The area incorporates several smaller neighborhoods, including Lenox Hill, Carnegie Hill, and Yorkville. Once known as the Silk Stocking District, it has long been the most affluent neighborhood in New York City.

The Upper East Side is part of Manhattan Community District 8, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10021, 10028, 10065, 10075, and 10128. It is patrolled by the 19th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==Geography==
Neighborhood boundaries in New York City are not officially set, but according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of New York City&quot;, the Upper East Side is bounded by 59th Street in the south, 96th Street on the north, Fifth Avenue to the west, and the East River to the east. The &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; extends the northern boundary to 106th Street near Fifth Avenue.

The area&#x27;s north-south avenues are Fifth, Madison, Park, Lexington, Third, Second, First, York, and East End Avenues, with the latter running only from East 79th Street to East 90th Street. The major east-west streets are 59th Street, 72nd Street, 79th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street.

Some real-estate agents use the term &quot;Upper East Side&quot;, instead of &quot;East Harlem&quot;, to describe areas that are slightly north of 96th Street and near Fifth Avenue, in order to avoid associating these areas with the negative connotations of the latter, a neighborhood which is generally perceived as less prestigious.

=== Historic districts ===

The Upper East Side Historic District was designated as a city district in 1981 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The city district runs from 59th to 78th Streets along Fifth Avenue, and up to Third Avenue at some points. It is composed of residential structures built after the American Civil War; mansions and townhouses built at the beginning of the 20th century; and apartment buildings erected later on. The city district was slightly expanded in 2010 with 74 additional buildings.

The Metropolitan Museum Historic District was designated a city district in 1977. It consists of properties on Fifth Avenue between 79th and 86th Streets, outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as properties on several side streets.

The Park Avenue Historic District was designated a city district in 2014. It encompasses 64 properties on Park Avenue between 79th and 91st Streets.

The Carnegie Hill Historic District was designated a city district in 1974 and expanded in 1993. It covers 400 buildings, primarily along Fifth Avenue from 86th to 98th Street, as well as on side streets extending east to Madison, Park, and Lexington Avenues.

There are also two smaller city historic districts. The Henderson Place Historic District, designated in 1969, comprises the town houses on East End Avenue between 86th and 87th Streets, built by John C. Henderson in 1981. The Treadwell Farm Historic District, designated in 1967, includes low-rise apartments on East 61st and 62nd Streets between Second and Third Avenues, on the former farm of Adam Treadwell.

==History==
===Development===

Before the arrival of Europeans, the mouths of streams that eroded gullies in the East River bluffs are conjectured to have been the sites of fishing camps used by the Lenape, whose controlled burns once a generation or so kept the dense canopy of oak–hickory forest open at ground level.

In the 19th century the farmland and market garden district of what was to be the Upper East Side was still traversed by the Boston Post Road and, from 1837, the New York and Harlem Railroad, which brought straggling commercial development around its one station in the neighborhood, at 86th Street, which became the heart of German Yorkville. The area was defined by the attractions of the bluff overlooking the East River, which ran without interruption from James William Beekman&#x27;s &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;, north of the marshy squalor of Turtle Bay, to Gracie Mansion, north of which the land sloped steeply to the wetlands that separated this area from the suburban village of Harlem. Among the series of villas a Schermerhorn country house overlooked the river at the foot of present-day 73rd Street and another, Peter Schermerhorn&#x27;s at 66th Street, and the Riker homestead was similarly sited at the foot of 75th Street. By the mid-19th century the farmland had largely been subdivided, with the exception of the of Jones&#x27;s Wood, stretching from 66th to 76th Streets and from the Old Post Road (Third Avenue) to the river and the farmland inherited by James Lenox, who divided it into blocks of houselots in the 1870s, built his Lenox Library on a Fifth Avenue lot at the farm&#x27;s south-west corner, and donated a full square block for the Presbyterian Hospital, between 70th and 71st Streets, and Madison and Park Avenues. At that time, along the Boston Post Road taverns stood at the mile-markers, Five-Mile House at 72nd Street and Six-Mile House at 97th, a New Yorker recalled in 1893.

The fashionable future of the narrow strip between Central Park and the railroad cut was established at the outset by the nature of its entrance, in the southwest corner, north of the Vanderbilt family&#x27;s favored stretch of Fifth Avenue from 50th to 59th Streets. A row of handsome townhouses was built on speculation by Mary Mason Jones, who owned the entire block bounded by 57th and 58th Streets and Fifth and Madison. In 1870 she occupied the prominent corner house at 57th and Fifth, though not in the isolation described by her niece, Edith Wharton, whose picture has been uncritically accepted as history, as Christopher Gray has pointed out:


===Arrival of famous residents===
Before the Park Avenue Tunnel was covered (finished in 1910), fashionable New Yorkers shunned the smoky railroad trench up Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue), to build stylish mansions and townhouses on the large lots along Fifth Avenue, facing Central Park, and on the adjacent side streets. The latest arrivals were the rich Pittsburghers Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick. The classic phase of Gilded Age Fifth Avenue as a stretch of private mansions was not long-lasting: the first apartment house to replace a private mansion on upper Fifth Avenue was 907 Fifth Avenue (1916), at 72nd Street, the neighborhood&#x27;s grand carriage entrance to Central Park.

Most members of New York&#x27;s upper-class families have made residences on the Upper East Side, including the oil-rich Rockefellers, political Roosevelts, political dynastic Kennedys, thoroughbred racing moneyed Whitneys, and tobacco and electric power fortuned Dukes.

===Transportation constructed===
Construction of the Third Avenue El, opened from 1878 in sections, followed by the Second Avenue El, opened in 1879, linked the Upper East Side&#x27;s middle class and skilled artisans closely to the heart of the city, and confirmed the modest nature of the area to their east. The unbuilt &quot;Hamilton Square&quot;, which had appeared as one of the few genteel interruptions of the grid plan on city maps since the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, was intended to straddle what had now become the Harlem Railroad right-of-way between 66th and 69th Streets; it never materialized, though during the Panic of 1857 its unleveled ground was the scene of an open-air mass meeting called in July to agitate for the secession of the city and its neighboring counties from New York State, and the city divided its acreage into house lots and sold them. From the 1880s the neighborhood of Yorkville became a suburb of middle class Germans.

Gracie Mansion, the last remaining suburban villa overlooking the East River at Carl Schurz Park, became the home of New York&#x27;s mayor in 1942. The East River Drive, designed by Robert Moses, was extended south from the first section, from 125th Street to 92nd Street, which was completed in 1934 as a boulevard, an arterial highway running at street level; reconstruction designs from 1948 to 1966 converted FDR Drive, as it was renamed after Franklin Delano Roosevelt, into the full limited-access parkway that is in use today.

Demolishing the elevated railways on Third and Second Avenues opened these tenement-lined streets to the construction of high-rise apartment blocks starting in the 1950s. Among these were Manhattan House at 200 East 66th Street, one of the first apartment buildings in New York City to use white glazed brick on its facade, as well as the Sutton Terrace development on Sutton Place. The demolition of the els had an adverse effect on transportation, because the IRT Lexington Avenue Line was now the only subway line in the area. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway was originally proposed in 1919. Finally, on January 1, 2017, the first phase of the line was completed with three new stations opened. This brought in new local business to the area and had positive impact on real estate prices in the Upper East Side.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies the Upper East Side as part of three neighborhood tabulation areas: Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill, Yorkville, and Lenox Hill-Roosevelt Island, divided by Third Avenue and 77th Street. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the combined population of these areas was 219,920, an increase of 2,857 (1.3%) from the 217,063 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhoods had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhoods was 79% (173,711) White, 3.2% (7,098) African American, 0.1% (126) Native American, 8.6% (18,847) Asian, 0% (98) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (609) from other races, and 1.8% (3,868) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race was 7.1% (15,563) of the population. While the White population is a dominating majority in all three census tabulation areas, it is more so in Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill compared to Yorkville and Lenox Hill-Roosevelt Island, being close to 90% of the population.

The racial composition of the Upper East Side changed moderately from 2000 to 2010. The most significant changes were the increase in the Asian population by 38% (5,145), the increase in the Hispanic/Latino population by 19% (2,537), and the decrease in the White population by 3% (5,644). The small Black population increased by 3% (191), while the even smaller population of all other races increased by 15% (628). Taking into account the three census tabulation areas, the decrease of the White population was concentrated Yorkville and Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill especially, while the increases of the other racial groups were evenly split across the three areas.

The entirety of Manhattan Community District 8, which comprises the Upper East Side and Roosevelt Island, had 225,914 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 85.9 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (37%) are between the ages of 25–44, while 24% are between 45 and 64, and 20% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 14% and 5% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 8 was $123,894, though the median income in the Upper East Side individually was $131,492. In 2018, an estimated 7% of Community District 8 residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty-five residents (4%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 41% in Community District 8, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 8 is not considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was not low-income in 1990.

=== Ethnic and socioeconomic trends ===
As of the 2000 census, twenty-one percent of the population was foreign born; of this, 45.6% came from Europe, 29.5% from Asia, 16.2% from Latin America and 8.7% from other areas. The female-male ratio was very high with 125 females for 100 males. The Upper East Side contains a large and affluent Jewish population estimated at 56,000. Traditionally, the Upper East Side has been dominated by wealthy White Anglo-Saxon Protestant families.

Given its very high population density and per capita income ($85,081 in 2000), the neighborhood contains the greatest concentration of individual wealth in Manhattan. As of 2011, the median household income for the Upper East Side was $131,492. The Upper East Side maintains the highest pricing per square foot in the United States. A 2002 report cited the average cost per square meter as $8,856; however, that price has noticed a substantial jump, increasing to almost as much as $11,200 per square meter as of 2006. There are some buildings which cost about $125 per square foot (~$1345/ m2). The only public housing projects for those of low to moderate incomes on the Upper East Side are located just south of the neighborhood&#x27;s northern limit at 96th Street, the Holmes Towers and Isaacs Houses. It borders East Harlem, which has the highest concentration of public housing in the United States.

===Politics===

Politically, the Upper East Side is in New York&#x27;s 12th congressional district, which has a Cook PVI of D+34 and is currently represented by Democrat Jerry Nadler. It is in the New York State Senate&#x27;s 27th, 28th, and 29th districts, the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 73rd and 76th districts, and the New York City Council&#x27;s 4th and 5th districts.

The Upper East Side is one of few areas of Manhattan where Republicans constitute more than 20% of the electorate. In the southwestern part of the neighborhood, Republican voters equal Democratic voters (the only such area in Manhattan), whereas in the rest of the neighborhood Republicans make up between 20 and 40% of registered voters. Nonetheless, it is still heavily Democratic; in the 2020 presidential election, every single precinct voted for Joe Biden and all but one gave him over 70% of the vote.

The Upper East Side is notable as a significant location of political fundraising in the United States. Four of the top five ZIP Codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan.

<text>Six Companies, Inc. was a joint venture of construction companies that was formed to build the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in Nevada and Arizona.

They later built Parker Dam, a portion of the Grand Coulee Dam, the Colorado River Aqueduct across the Mojave and Colorado Deserts to urban Southern California, and many other large projects.

== Hoover Dam ==
On January 10, 1932, the Bureau of Reclamation made bid documents for the Hoover Dam construction project available to interested parties at $5 a copy (equivalent to $ in ). The government would provide the materials, and the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100 pages of text and 76 drawings. A $2 million (equivalent to $ in ) bid bond was to accompany each bid. The winner would have to post a $5 million (equivalent to $ in ) performance bond. The contractor would have seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue.

Because of the project&#x27;s immense size and the fact that it was the first dam on the Colorado River, no single contractor had the resources to make a qualified bid alone. So, general contractors Utah Construction Company of Ogden, Utah decided to form a consortium in order to submit a joint bid for the contract. Initially, Utah Construction Company&#x27;s owners, brothers E.O. and W.H. Wattis, along with the company&#x27;s vice president, Andrew H. Christensen, asked Harry W. Morrison of Morrison-Knudsen to join them. After they realized the bid would be much higher than expected, the Wattis Brothers and Morrison-Knudsen convinced four additional companies to join. In February 1930 The Six Companies, Inc. was incorporated as a joint venture and they began working out a bid enlisting the help of Morrison-Knudsen employee Frank T. Crowe to do so.

The project was so complex and large that only three bids were received and, on March 4, 1931, the US Secretary of the Interior accepted the Six Companies&#x27; bid of US$48,890,955 (equivalent to $ in ). This was $5,000,000 lower than the next bidder, meaning a bid-spread of almost 10%.

The Six Companies board selected Crowe, who had helped draft the bid, as the General Construction Superintendent of the Boulder Dam construction. He was heavily involved and hired each of the men who were employed during the course of the project, lived in Boulder City with his wife and two daughters, and was on the dam site every day of the week until the project was completed.

Work began around June 1931 and The Six Companies completed the dam&#x27;s construction two years ahead of schedule in 1935. Crowe was awarded a bonus percentage of the profit for completing virtually every portion of the job well ahead of schedule. The dam was dedicated in September 1935 but it took an additional nine years (1938–1947) under relative secrecy, to fix serious leaks with a supplemental grout curtain.

== Six Companies Railroad ==
The Six Companies also built the Six Companies Railroad. It ran along the Hemenway Wash, present day Las Vegas Bay, and connected to the US Government Hoover Dam Railroad at Lawler, Nevada, a location also known as &quot;US Government Junction&quot;. From Lawler the railroad went north for to Saddle Island and then east to the Three-Way Junction gravel plant, now submerged under Lake Mead. From the gravel plant the line split into two branches. One branch ran south for to the dam via Cape Horn, Lomix (the Low Level Concrete Mixing Plant) and Himix (the High Level Concrete Mixing Plant) and the dam face. The other branch, now also submerged under Lake Mead, ran north for across the Las Vegas Wash, crossed the Colorado River on a bridge into Arizona and the Arizona gravel pit (Arizona Gravel Deposits) at a location from Callville.

The line was constructed by railroad contractor John Phillips of San Francisco, California. Since the completion of the dam and filling of Lake Mead, Six Companies, Inc. railroad line is now submerged.

The Western Pacific Railroad purchased several of the Six Companies dump cars for company service after the dam was completed and the equipment declared surplus. One of these cars is now preserved at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California.

The US Government Railroad had a branch that brought supplies by rail from a connection with the Boulder City Branch of the Union Pacific Railroad at Boulder City, Nevada.

== WWII ==
During World War II, the Six Companies built airstrips and related facilities on Pacific islands. The venture also held a majority ownership interest in Joshua Hendy Iron Works in Sunnyvale, California. Hendy was most known for its record-breaking assembly line production of 754 Liberty Ship EC-2 Reciprocating Steam Engines, producing one engine every 40.8 hours. They were used at the Richmond Shipyards.

<text>Geum , (Latinized Greek for &quot;taste&quot; referencing the roots of the plant) commonly called avens, is a genus of about 50 species of rhizomatous perennial herbaceous plants in the rose family and its subfamily Rosoideae which are widely distributed across Europe, Asia, North and South America, Africa, and New Zealand. They are closely related to &quot;Potentilla&quot; and &quot;Fragaria&quot;. From a basal rosette of leaves, they produce flowers on wiry stalks, in shades of white, red, yellow, and orange, in midsummer. &quot;Geum&quot; species are evergreen except where winter temperatures drop below . The cultivar &#x27;Mrs J. Bradshaw&#x27; (with orange flowers) has the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

&quot;Geum&quot; species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the grizzled skipper.

The UK National Collection of geums is held at Brickwall Cottage Garden and Nursery in Frittenden, Kent.

<text>A state visit is a formal visit by the head of a sovereign country (or representative of the head of a sovereign country) to another sovereign country, at the invitation of the head of state (or representative) of that foreign country, with the latter also acting as the official host for the duration of the state visit. Speaking for the host, it is generally called a state reception. State visits are considered to be the highest expression of friendly bilateral relations between two sovereign states, and are in general characterised by an emphasis on official public ceremonies.

Less formal visits than a state visit to another country with a lesser emphasis on ceremonial events, by either a head of state (their representative) or a head of government, can be classified (in descending order of magnitude) as either an official visit, an official working visit, a working visit, a guest-of-government visit, or a private visit.

In parliamentary democracies, while heads of state (or their representative) may formally issue and accept invitations, they do so on the advice of their heads of government, who usually decide on when the invitation is to be issued or accepted in advance.

Queen Elizabeth II was the most travelled head of state in world history, having made 261 official overseas visits and 96 state visits to 116 countries by the time of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Although she was sovereign of each of the Commonwealth realms, in practice, she usually performed full state visits as Queen of the United Kingdom, while the relevant governor-general undertook state visits for his or her respective country on the sovereign&#x27;s behalf. However, the Queen occasionally made some state and official visits representing one of her other Commonwealth realms.

==Components of a state visit==
State visits typically involve some or all the following components (each host country has its own traditions):

* The visiting head of state (or representative) is immediately greeted upon arrival by the host (or by a lesser official representative, if the two heads of state are to meet later at another location) and by his or her ambassador (or other head of mission) accredited to the host country.
* A 21-gun salute is fired in honor of the visiting head of state.
* The playing of the two national anthems by a military band. The guest country&#x27;s anthem is usually played first.
* A review of a military guard of honour.
* The visiting head of state (or representative) is formally introduced to senior officials/representatives of the host country and the hosting head of state is introduced to the delegation accompanying the visiting head of state.
* An exchange of gifts between the two heads of state (or representatives).
* A state dinner, either white tie or black tie, is mounted by the hosting head of state (or representative), with the visiting head of state being the guest of honour.
* A visit to the legislature of the host country, often with the visiting head of state (or representative) being invited to deliver a formal address to the assembled members of the legislature.
* High-profile visits by the visiting heads of state (or representative) to host country landmarks such as laying a wreath at a military shrine or cemetery.
* The staging of cultural events celebrating links between the two nations.

The visiting head of state (or their representative) is usually accompanied by a senior government minister, usually by a foreign minister. Behind the diplomatic protocol, delegations made up from trade organizations also accompany the visiting head of state, offer an opportunity to network and develop economic, cultural, and social links with industry leaders in the nation being visited. At the end of a state visit, the foreign head of state (or representative) traditionally issues a formal invitation to the head of state (or representative) of the nation being visited who at another time in the future, would pay a reciprocal state visit.

While the costs of a state visit are usually borne by state funds of the host country, most nations host fewer than ten state visits per year, with some as few as two. Most foreign heads of state (or their representative) will stay in the official residence of the head of state (or representative) who is hosting the state visit, in a guest house reserved for foreign visitors, or in their own nation&#x27;s embassy located in the foreign nation being visited.

State visits by well-known global leaders or figures, such as the British Monarch, the president of the United States or the pope, often draw much publicity and large crowds. Occasionally, these include protesters.

==State visits by country==
===Armenia===

State visits to Armenia are held in the capital of Yerevan, with a welcoming ceremony usually being held at Zvartnots International Airport. Foreign heads of state are welcomed at the President&#x27;s Residence while heads of government are welcomed at the Residence of the Prime Minister. These visits consist of the following components:

Since 1991, foreign leaders who embark on visits to Armenia have paid tribute to the victims of the Armenian genocide at the Tsitsernakaberd complex. During a visit to the complex, most leaders receive a tour of the museum, plant trees near the memorial, and lay wreaths at the eternal flame.

===Belgium===
A state visit in Belgium starts with an inspection of the troops in front of the Royal Palace of Brussels, whereafter the king and queen have a private audience with the visiting head of state and his or her spouse. The first day of the state visit traditionally comes to a close with a state banquet at the Castle of Laeken, which is the official residence of the king of the Belgians.

It is customary to be awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold during state visits.

===Canada===

The Office of Protocol coordinates the operational aspects of state and official visits to Canada and manages all events that are related to the visit. It also defines the protocol standards for state visits of heads of state and government.

The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, one of two household foot guards, take part in state and official visits to Ottawa. Arrival ceremonies take place at either Parliament Hill or Rideau Hall, where the visitor will be received by the governor general of Canada (for state visits) or prime minister of Canada (for official visits). State visits also include a visit to the National War Memorial.

State and official visits by Canada are performed by the Canadian monarch or a representative—the governor general, a lieutenant governor, or another member of the royal family. The first state visit by Canada was to the United States in 1937, when the US accorded the governor general the equivalent status given to a visiting head of state.

Tours of Canada by the country&#x27;s monarch (and other members of the royal family) are not state or official visits, as the monarch conducts royal tours in his capacity as the Canadian head of state, not as a foreign head of state. Additionally, because the Canadian sovereign is shared with 14 other Commonwealth realms, state visits are not conducted between realms, with official visits performed by the realms&#x27; respective governor-general, or prime minister.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

State arrival ceremonies in China take place at the East Court of the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The guard of honour for the ceremony is provided by the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard, with musical accompaniment provided by the Central Military Band of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China.

As the military band plays the national anthems of the two countries, an artillery battery fires a 21-gun salute. After the band finishes its performance, the two leaders then inspect the guard of honour at the invitation of the guard commander. Following the inspection, both leaders embrace schoolchildren who wave flowers and the flags of both countries. At this time, the band performs a military march or folk song from the guest country. If a prime minister or chancellor or crown prince visits China, the welcoming ceremony is held by the premier. If a president, governor-general or king visits, the welcoming ceremony is held by the president.

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) Honor Guard then marches off the square to the tune of the March of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army. The ceremony ends with the marching band of the PLA performing an exhibition of military drill.

During state visits, national awards are presented to visiting dignitaries, including the Order of Friendship. Since 1954, the State Protection Unit has provided motorcades for visiting dignitaries traveling from the airport to their meeting place.

=== Republic of China (Taiwan) ===
A 30-minute ceremony at the Plaza of the National Performing Arts Center in Taipei takes place to honor visiting dignitaries to the Republic of China (Taiwan). After the anthems are played, the president escorts the visitor past the tri-service honor guard of the Republic of China Armed Forces, led by a colonel. After inspecting the troops, the president of Taiwan delivers welcome remarks, after which the foreign leader speaks, before receiving a key to the city from the mayor of Taipei, and the director of the Department of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then introducing members of the cabinet to the dignitary and members of the delegation to the ROC president.

===Czech Republic===
The military welcome accorded to foreign leaders at Prague Castle are provided by troops of the Prague Castle Guard, Honor Guard of the Czech Armed Forces, the Czech Army Central Band, the Band of the Castle Guards and Police and units of the Prague Garrison Command.

===Finland===

The Protocol Services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for arranging high-level international visits and Finland&#x27;s own state events. The task of the protocol services is to take care of receiving, escorting, accommodation, transportation and meal arrangements for guests.

In Finland, state visits usually follow a certain pattern that has already become a tradition. The official reception ceremonies take place in front of the Presidential Palace or alternatively at Helsinki Airport. At the reception ceremony, the head of the visiting country, together with the President of Finland, inspects the guard of honor to the rhythm of the &quot;Björneborgarnas marsch&quot;. After the inspection of the honor guard and the performance of the national anthems, the heads of state greet the public from the balcony of the Presidential Palace, from where they move to the yellow salon to drink welcome toasts, take official photos and exchange gifts and badges of honor.

Usually, the official program includes at least the laying a wreath on Marshal Mannerheim&#x27;s grave at the Hietaniemi Cemetery, and a visit to the Parliament House or the Helsinki City Hall. The visit usually ends with state dinners held at the Presidential Palace, where the heads of state give their speeches.

===France===

State arrival ceremonies are held at either the Elysee Palace or Les Invalides, with the participation of the Infantry and Fanfare Band of the French Republican Guard Band and the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Republican Guard. The Vestibule d&#x27;Honneur (Hall of Honour) in the Elysee is where the president of France meets visiting dignitaries and holds bilateral meetings. Towards the end of the visit, the head of state or governments will give a speech at the Palais Bourbon to the Senate of France, and will hold meetings with members of parliament. Sometime during the state visit, the visiting dignitary will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe.

===Georgia===
State visits in Georgia are held outside the Presidential Palace of Georgia in Tbilisi. Ceremonial honours are provided by the Honour Guard and the Band of the National Guard of Georgia. The band plays Georgian Army songs during the inspection of the honour guard. During the presidency of Mikheil Saakashvili, the band played the March of the Preobrazhensky Regiment during state visits.

During state visits, dignitaries usually meet with the prime minister, chairperson of the Parliament, and the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia separately from the president. State dinners are also held inside the presidential palace with officials from both countries present.

===Germany===
During state visits to Germany, honours are provided by the German Wachbataillon (Guard battalion) and the Staff Band of the Bundeswehr. An exception to this was on 3 May 2007 during the visit of French President Jacques Chirac to Berlin, during which the Franco-German Brigade provided the honors. Depending on the status of the guest, state ceremonies are either held at the Bellevue Palace or the Federal Chancellery Complex. In recent years, state visits have been marked with dignitaries paying homage at memorials such as the Berlin Victory Column, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, and the Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten).

During state visits, foreign dignitaries typically visit German federal states outside the capital. It this regard, a full honors ceremony is also held with the minister-president being the presiding officer. In break with the traditional Berlin military protocol, chairs have since July 2019 been set up outside the Chancellery due to Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s unusual episodes of shaking and uneasiness during the honours ceremony. Currently, only Moldovan Premier Maia Sandu and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen have had to be received under this arrangement.

===India===
Foreign leaders are received at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi during state visits. The dignitary first receives the salute from the President&#x27;s Bodyguard (PBG), and the Tri-Services Guard of Honour. Heads of state are also given a 21-gun salute, with a 19-gun salute being to heads of government. The massed bands and the commander of the guard of honour is chosen by a rotation between the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force. In 2015, Wing Commander Pooja Thakur became the first female officer to lead the guard of honour for a foreign leader. All military honours are organized by Section D of the Ministry of Defence.

State banquets are also held for foreign dignitaries at the Rashtrapati Bhavan which are hosted by the president of India. Over 100 guests are invited to attend state banquets, including the vice-president of India, the prime minister of India, as well as government officials and leaders of the ruling
party.

===Israel===
The president of the State of Israel, in his or her position as head of state, leads the welcoming events and is the official host of foreign leaders who visit Israel. A guard of honor made up of personnel of all the service branches of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are usually lined up at the main V.I.P terminal of Ben Gurion International Airport.

During some state visits, the itinerary has included a visit to the Yad Vashem memorial. There the leader, accompanied by the prime minister, will rekindle the Eternal Flame, and will also lay a wreath in memorial of the 6 million Jews murdered in the holocaust.

===Italy===
When dignitaries arrive in the Italian capital of Rome, they are received in a short reception ceremony at the airport by the head of the Diplomatic Ceremonial Office among other officials, who then briefly entertain the guest in the boardroom to allow the handling of airport formalities. Arrival honors for foreign dignitaries visiting Rome are held either at the Quirinal Palace (official residence of the president of the Italian Republic) or the Palazzo Chigi (official residence of the prime minister of the Italian Republic). During the ceremony, the guard of honor is provided by a military unit (most likely the Corazzieri and a selected ceremonial unit such as the Honour Company &quot;Goito&quot; from the 1° Regiment &quot;Granatieri di Sardegna&quot;) and a supporting military band that performs 3 Ruffles and flourishes known as &quot;Onori&quot; (&quot;Honors&quot;) prior to playing the national anthem of the dignitary&#x27;s home country and Il Canto degli Italiani. In recent years, the Bersaglieri, the Carabinieri, and the Italian Navy have provided honor guards for the ceremony.

The rest of the day includes bilateral meetings, one on one conversations, a joint press conference, and a state dinner, where the exchange of gifts and the awarding of honors takes place. The next day sees the laying of wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Altar of the Homeland. All protocol events in the capital are organized by the State Ceremonial Office. In particular, the Ceremonial Office of the Ministry of Defense handles protocol related to the Italian Armed Forces, and the Diplomatic Ceremonial Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles protocol related to the diplomatic corps.

===Japan===

Japan extends invitations for state visitors and official visitors aims to promote the friendship and relation between Japan and the country of the invitee. In addition to state and official visits, the Japanese government also extends several other forms of invitations to visit the country.

The invitation of official practical visitors, practical visitors, and visitors to Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs aim to promote negotiations, to strengthen security and to be used for policy coordination, etc.

During the state visits by people belonging to the upper two categories, guards of honour are mounted by the Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency and the 302nd Military Police Company of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.

===Kyrgyzstan===

State visits are planned in accordance with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs one month in advance. Arrival ceremonies for state visits to Kyrgyzstan typically take place at Manas International Airport with the participation of the Honour Guard Battalion of the 701st Military Unit of the National Guard and the Band of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Kyrgyzstan. A wreath-laying ceremony is also held at Victory Square. A bilateral meeting, press conference, and state dinner are all held at the Ala Archa State Residence.

The Kyrgyz official welcoming group includes the chairman of the Supreme Council, the prime minister, and the minister of foreign affairs. The official morning breakfast reception takes place from 11:00 am to 3:00 pm. Arrival ceremonies are also held at the state residences all over the country.

===Mexico===
State visits to Mexico City are held on a regular basis. Arrival ceremonies are usually held at the National Palace, the president&#x27;s workplace or at Mexico City International Airport. On certain occasions, a full honors ceremony with the participation of the National Guard&#x27;s Presidential Guards Corps are held at Campo Marte, where the corps&#x27; two military police brigades are stationed.

The arrival ceremony begins with a platoon of National Guards presenting arms at the arrival of the state guest at the entrance of the National Palace. After the state guest arrives with the president of Mexico (and his or her first partner, if present) in the palace&#x27; south courtyard the NG&#x27;s Presidential Guards honor guard company presents arms while the Representative Music Band of the Mexican Armed Forces plays the anthems of the two countries (the Himno Nacional Mexicano is always played first). Then the president of Mexico introduces members of his or her cabinet before the visiting dignitary introduces members of their delegation accompanying them on this visit. After this is done, the commander of the National Guard&#x27;s honour guard company then delivers the following report to the dignitary:

::&quot;“With your permission Mr/Madam President of the United Mexican States, I am the commander of the honour guard of the (states dignitary&#x27;s position) and I invite you to review the guard of honour present, sir/ma&#x27;am.&quot;&quot;

The president and the dignitary then inspect the guard, paying homage to the Mexican flag and the flag of the guest country along the way. The ceremony then ends and the two go into the palace to begin their bilateral meeting. The Campo Marte ceremony is similar in style to the palace ceremony with the main differences being a 21-gun salute, opening remarks, and the military parade being added to the program. The unit responsible currently for the 21-gun salute is the State Honors Artillery Battery, coming under the 1st Artillery Battalion (Separate) of the 1st Army Corps.

===Moldova===
The State Diplomatic Protocol (SDP) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration of Moldova organizes activities concerning state visits to the Moldovan capital of Chișinău. All state arrival ceremonies take place at the Presidential Administration or the Presidential Palace, involving the Honor Guard Company and the Presidential Band. During the inspection, the foreign guest will greet the personnel of the company in the Romanian language (the dignitary will say &quot;buna ziua&quot; or &quot;good morning&quot; to which the soldiers will respond by saying &quot;salutari&quot; or &quot;greetings&quot;). Foreign guests may also visit the Gagauz capital of Comrat.

===Netherlands===

State visits in the Netherlands revolve around and are centered on the capital of Amsterdam. A characteristic of a state visit is that it is usually carried out by a foreign head of state, rather than a head of government. Upon arrival to the country, the dignitary will be given a tour through the capital, which includes a wreath-laying ceremony at the National Monument. Foreign dignitaries are usually received by the monarch at the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, where they receive a guard of honour formed by the Grenadiers&#x27; and Rifles Guard Regiment upon arrival. It is here where all matters of state and bilateral meetings take place over the course of the visit.

During a state visit, the Dutch monarch always hosts a state dinner in honor of the guest, sometimes at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam and at other times at the monarch&#x27;s residence at the Noordeinde Palace in The Hague. It is customary to be awarded the Knight Grand Cross Order of the Netherlands Lion during state visits.

===North Korea===
Although state visits to North Korea do not happen often, they are held to the highest standard when they occur. Portraits of the visiting leader and the Supreme Leader of North Korea are hung all over the city and at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport, where the arrival ceremony takes place. During the ceremony, the Guard of Honour Company of the Korean People&#x27;s Army&#x27;s Supreme Guard Command, made up of servicemen from the Ground Forces, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations and the Strategic Forces, together with a platoon of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards renders honours while the Central Band of the KPA performs the visiting anthem and &quot;Aegukka&quot;, the anthem of the DPRK. After this, the commander of the guard reports to the leader before they inspect the troops and review a marchpast. They then ride in a motorcade that takes them to the Paekhwawon State Guest House and or the Kumsusan Guesthouse for bilateral negotiations. The former guest house was first used for state visits in the early 2000s for the visits of Madeleine Albright and Junichiro Koizumi and became relevant once again during the 2018–19 Korean peace process. The latter was only built in the spring of 2019 in time for the visit of the Chinese President and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. En route to the guesthouse, a Korean Children&#x27;s Union guard of honour company takes its position to award an honorary red neckerchief to the visiting leader in the name of all members present, and in addition, flower bouquets can be given by representatives on behalf of the KPA, the people of Pyongyang, and the city government.

Notable state visits held in the 21st century were those by South Korean leaders such as Roh Moo-hyun in 2007 and Moon Jae In in 2018, as well as Chinese leader Xi Jinping that same year. During Xi&#x27;s visit, he became the first Chinese Paramount leader to visit the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun and took part in the reopening of the Arirang Mass Games at Rungrado 1st of May Stadium. For many state visits, the Korean People&#x27;s Army State Merited Chorus and Symphony Orchestra have performed pieces native to the visitors homeland, such as &quot;Katyusha&quot; during Vladimir Putin&#x27;s visit in 2000. Other lower-level world leaders who have undertaken state visits to the DPRK include Cuban leader Miguel Diaz-Canel in November 2018 and Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj in 2013, with the latter being played down as it did not include a meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un.

===Norway===

State visits to the Norwegian capital of Oslo begin with the inspecting of the 3rd Company, Hans Majestet Kongens Garde at the Royal Palace by the visiting dignitary and the Norwegian monarch. Once they are in the palace, the monarch takes the dignitary to the Bird Room to engage in an exchange of gifts. The visit also includes a wreath-laying ceremony at Akershus Fortress, which is also an official residence of the prime minister of Norway. In the evening, a gala dinner hosted by the royal family of Norway is held at the Royal Palace in honour of the visiting head of state.

As it refers to state visits by the monarch of Norway, they are always accompanied by the Norwegian foreign minister and representatives of the Government. Between two and four state visits to Oslo and royal visits to other countries are made per year, usually by the reigning monarch.

===Poland===
State visits take place on a regular basis in Poland. Ceremonial honours a provided by the Representative Honor Guard Regiment of the Polish Armed Forces at the Presidential Palace. Musical accompaniment is provided by the Representative Central Band of the Polish Armed Forces.

The White Hall in the Presidential Palace is used to host foreign heads of state. The hall is located at the main entrance from the courtyard, where the welcoming ceremony takes place.

===Russia===

The Department of State Protocol of the Russian Foreign Ministry is responsible for organizing the itinerary for state visits to the country. It was founded on 18 December 1991, by Decree No. 291 of President Boris Yeltsin on the basis of the Foreign Policy Service of the RSFSR. The decree, in effect, provided a new unified protocol practice in the Russian Federation. Its duties range from organizing invitations to the country to developing an event schedule for the dignitary&#x27;s visit. Common practices organized by the department include protocol events meetings, wreath-laying, breakfast, and lunch, among others. The Presidential Protocol Office in the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation also serves a similar purpose.

A foreign head of state or government receives arrival honours from the 154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant&#x27;s Regiment and the Special Exemplary Military Band upon their arrival at the VIP terminal at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, where they are usually greeted by the Russian deputy foreign minister. Heads of state also take part in a welcoming ceremony with the president of Russia in the Hall of the Order of St. George of the Grand Kremlin Palace.

The following is Estonian diplomat Tiit Matsulevitš&#x27;s opinion on Russian protocol for state visits:

===Spain===
State visits to the Kingdom of Spain are held with the participation of the King and Queen of Spain. The day&#x27;s events begin as the visiting dignitary arrives in a special vehicle at the Palacio Real in the Spanish capital of Madrid. As the dignitary arrives, units of the Spanish Royal Guard (including the Mounted Band of Timpani and Bugles and the Lancers Troop) prepares for the start of the arrival ceremony. The ceremony starts with all units presenting arms at the sound of a bugle call and performing a royal salute, with the playing of the guest anthem and the &quot;Marcha Real&quot; taking place. Once the regiment is orders arms, three senior officers from the guard (a senior commander, a bugler and a guidon bearer) approach the central grandstand to report to the guest and the king on the readiness of the regiment for inspection. They then begin their inspection, reviewing the infantry as well as the mounted units. Once the review is complete, a large military parade in the forecourt of the palace is held with the massed bands playing military music as the units march past.

The other notable state ceremony that takes place in the palace is the state dinner, which is hosted by the king, and is attended by the visiting dignitary, his or her delegation, the Spanish royal family, the prime minister, and other government officials. During the course of the visit, the visiting leader may deliver an address to a joint session of the bicameral Cortes Generales (composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies).

===Ukraine===
State visits to Ukraine are managed by the Main Department on State Protocol and Ceremonies of the Office of the President of Ukraine as well as the State Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. State visits involve the president of Ukraine, the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, and the prime minister of Ukraine. Heads of state are met at the Boryspil International Airport, during which they are met by children in Ukrainian national costumes handing them bread. after which they are driven to the Mariinskyi Palace to receive a guard of honour from the Kyiv Presidential Honor Guard Battalion. The battalion band performs national anthems of both countries, during which a 21-gun artillery salute. As the guest bows his or her head to the state flag of Ukraine, they greet the honor guard with the battle cry of &quot;Glory to Ukraine&quot; (the official greeting of the Armed Forces of Ukraine). After the ceremony, negotiations and a working breakfast/lunch are arranged in honor of the guest. In Kyiv, there is a tradition of laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the ceremony of which is as follows: a march of the three man team carrying a wreath through the Alley of Glory, wreath laying in front of the eternal flame, performance of national anthems, a march past of a guard of honour. On the first day of the visit, as a rule, a public dinner is held on behalf of the president of Ukraine in honor of the head of state in the Red Hall. At the end of the state dinner, a concert of musicians is held in the White Hall. Protocol stipulates that a state visit lasts longer (3–4 days) than an official visit (2–3 days).

===United Arab Emirates===
The United Arab Emirates Air Force does a flyover while painting the sky in the colors of the visiting country&#x27;s flag as the leader&#x27;s car arrives at the presidential palace with an Army mounted escort. Upon arrival, the visiting head of state is greeted by the president of the UAE or the deputy supreme commander of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces, where they both receive military honors from the UAE Presidential Guard as well as a 21-gun salute from members of the Army. While inside the palace they are also greeted by children holding UAE flags as well as flags of the visiting country. The entire city of Abu Dhabi is usually decorated for the visit, with flags being laid out in the streets and large pictures of the leaders of the visiting country and the UAE being put on large buildings. During the visit of Vladimir Putin in October 2019, police cars were sprayed with the Cyrillic letters &quot;ДПС&quot;, which stands for the &quot;Дорожно-патрульная служба&quot; ().

===United Kingdom===
A state visit to the United Kingdom is a royal event which involves the King and other members of the royal family. An arrival ceremony usually takes place on Horse Guards Parade (there are also some instances where it takes place at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle) with a guard of honour being provided by members of the King&#x27;s Guard. The guard of honour will always report to the dignitary in the language of the visitor, with the report being along the lines of the following:

::&quot;Your Excellency, the guard of honour, provided by the (states name of unit), is formed up, and ready for inspection.&quot;

Depending on the area where the ceremony takes place, a march past will immediately take place following the inspection. The foreign guest and the King then travel to Buckingham Palace in a carriage procession escorted by a large number of mounted soldiers from the Household Cavalry. The welcome ceremony is accompanied by 21-gun salutes fired from Green Park and the Tower of London. Around 150 guests are invited to Buckingham Palace for the state banquet in the evening in the ballroom.

State visits do not formally occur between the United Kingdom and the 14 other Commonwealth realms, as the realms all share a common monarch and head of state. A visit conducted by the monarch to another Commonwealth realm is also not considered a state visit, but is termed a royal tour. Tours of Commonwealth realms by the monarch are conducted in their capacity as the monarch of that respective realm, and not as the British monarch. As a result, visits on behalf of the United Kingdom to other Commonwealth realms are typically conducted as official visits by the prime minister of the United Kingdom. Conversely, official visits to the United Kingdom by another Commonwealth realm is typically performed by their respective governor-general, or prime minister.

=== United States ===
State visits to Washington, D.C., occur only on the invitation of the president of the United States in their position as head of state and head of the federal government of the United States. Official visits refer to a visit by a head of government to Washington. During state visits, there are usually many events taking place in the capital, with the participation of hundreds of individuals. The first state visit took place in 1874 by Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawaii, followed by Pedro II of Brazil in 1876.

Events can range from a flight line ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, an arrival ceremony (either at the White House or The Pentagon depending on the guest), a State Department luncheon, a state dinner and an address to the Congress.

<doc id="327285" wikidata="Q7287324" url="?curid=327285" title="Ralph Carney">
<text>Ralph Carney (January 23, 1956 – December 17, 2017) was an American multi-instrumentalist, singer and composer. While his primary instruments were various saxophones and clarinets, Carney also collected and played many instruments, often unusual or obscure ones.

He is best known for his long association with Tom Waits and for his collaboration on the theme song for &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, along with his nephew Patrick Carney.

==Early years==
Carney was born and grew up in Akron, Ohio, and listened to music on a windup record player. He was the youngest of three siblings. His father, William Carney, worked in polyester research for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., headquartered in Akron. Ralph Carney showed an early interest in art, but turned to music in the eighth grade. He started learning five string banjo, violin, and harmonica and played bluegrass and country blues. His father, as well as his mother, Madge Carney, encouraged his interest in music. At age 15 he started to play saxophone. He also worked in a mall record store.

==Career==
Carney got his start as a professional musician as a founding member of the experimental rock and new wave band Tin Huey. In addition to work with Tin Huey in the 1970s and Tom Waits from the 1980s onwards, Carney also recorded or performed with Dieselhed, Marc Ribot, the B-52&#x27;s, Elvis Costello, Jonathan Richman, Les Claypool, St. Vincent, Stan Ridgway, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, Jed Davis, Bill Laswell, Griddle, and HowellDevine, among others. In 1981, Carney was one of the lead members of the Swollen Monkeys, along with Mars Williams later of the Psychedelic Furs : the group released an album that year &quot;Afterbirth of the Cool&quot; produced by Hal Willner. Carney released several solo albums and was a member of the Oranj Symphonette with fellow Waits alumni Joe Gore and Matt Brubeck. He also headed up San Francisco&#x27;s Carneyball Johnson, playing on saxophones, Turkish clarinet, piccolo, trumpet, percussion and vocals.

Carney collaborated with the Black Keys on their studio album &quot;Attack &amp; Release&quot; (2008). He occasionally joined them on stage when they toured that record. In 2014, he collaborated with his nephew Patrick for the BoJack Horseman theme song. He toured with They Might Be Giants in the fall of 2009. He recorded and performed with Black Francis in 2008 a score for the silent film &quot;Der Golem&quot; (1920), he guested with Yo La Tengo and Medeski Martin &amp; Wood for live shows in 2010 and 2011. He recorded on a T Bone Burnett-produced project the Ghost Brothers of Darkland County with Marc Ribot and Elvis Costello, as yet unreleased. He performed on many Hal Willner-produced shows at UCLA&#x27;s Royce Hall including a Tribute to Harry Smith in 2001, with a huge number of performers including Todd Rundgren, Philip Glass, and David Johansen.

Carney composed music for two poetry records on Paris Records. One was with poet Robert Creeley called &quot;Really!&quot;. He also did music for an Ira Cohen record called the &quot;Stauffenberg Cycle&quot;. In 1994 Ralph performed on the Kathy Acker record &quot;Redoing Childhood&quot; (Paris Records). He did some songs for some flash Web Premiere Toons cartoons on CartoonNetwork.com in 2001. His old band Tin Huey put out a compilation CD of unreleased material in 2009 on Smog Veil Records. He did a collaboration with David Greenberger who puts out the Duplex Planet called &quot;Oh Pa&quot; that came out in late 2011. After 2009 he recorded and played gigs with his Ralph Carney&#x27;s Serious Jass Project. A new record &quot;Seriously&quot; was issued in July 2011 on Smog Veil Records.

==Personal life==
Carney&#x27;s nephew Patrick Carney is the drummer for the rock band the Black Keys. The two collaborated on the theme music to the Netflix original series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;. A memorial tribute can be observed during the opening credits to season 5. 

His older brother, Jim Carney, is a retired reporter for the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot;.

Carney died on December 17, 2017, at the age of 61, from head injuries sustained falling down steps in his home in Portland, Oregon, the previous day. He was survived by his daughter, Hedda, as well as his partner, Megan Hinchliffe.

<text>Donisthorpe is a village in the North West Leicestershire district of Leicestershire, England, historically an exclave of Derbyshire.

== History ==
In 1086 Donisthorpe was part of the land given to Nigel of Stafford by William the Conqueror. It was then known as &quot;Durandestorp&quot; which has been interpreted as &#x27;the outlying settlement associated with Durand&#x27;.

From: &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot;, published by S Lewis, London, 1848. 

DONISTHORPE, an ecclesiastical district, in the union of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, partly in the parish of Nether Seal, W. division of the hundred of Goscote, N. division of the county of Leicester, and partly in the parishes of Church-Gresley, Measham, and Stretton-en-le-Fields, hundred of Repton and Gresley, S. division of the county of Derby, 3½ miles (S. W.) from Ashby-de-la-Zouch; containing about 1700 inhabitants, of whom 344 are in the hamlet of Donisthorpe. The district includes Oakthorpe and Moira; the Moira baths are celebrated for the cure of rheumatism, and there is a convenient hotel for the accommodation of visitors. The living is a perpetual curacy, in the patronage of the Bishop of Lichfield; net income, £150, with a parsonage-house. The impropriate tithes of Donisthorpe have been commuted for £87. The church, dedicated to St. John, was built and endowed in 1838, at an expense of £6000, chiefly by three maiden ladies of the name of Moore; it is a neat edifice, with a tower and pinnacles. A national school was built in 1840, by Sir John Cave Browne Cave, Bart., by whom, also, it is supported 

From: &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Directory of Leicestershire &amp; Rutland&quot; (1899) DONISTHORPE is a parish, formed in 1838, from the civil parishes of Church Gresley, Measham and Stretton-en-le-Field, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Seal, in Leicestershire, with a station on the Ashby and Nuneaton joint line of the Midland and London and North Western railways, 3 miles southwest from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, 8 southeast from Burton-upon-Trent and 114 northwest from London, in the Western division of the county, hundreds of Repton, Gresley and West Goscote, petty sessional division, union and county court district of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, rural deanery of Repton, archdeaconry of Derby and diocese of Southwell. Donisthorpe and Oakthorpe hamlets form a joint township in this ecclesiastical parish.

This parish, formerly in Derbyshire, was transferred to Leicestershire under the provisions of the Local Government (England and Wales) Act, 1888, by the counties of Derby and Leicester (Woodville &amp;c.) Order, which came into operation Sept. 30, 1897.

The church of St John the Evangelist, erected in 1838, is a building of grey sandstone in the Perpendicular style, consisting of nave, west porch and an embattled western tower, with pinnacles, containing a clock and one bell: the nave was restored in 1889—90, and further restorations were effected in 1891, at a total cost of £700, and again in 1898: there are 500 sittings, 200 being free. The register dates from the year 1838. The living is a vicarage, net yearly value £214, including 17 acres of glebe, with residence, in the gift of the Bishop of Southwell, and held since 1885 by the Rev. Edward Bertram Lavies Theol. Assoc. K.C.L. Here are two Primitive Methodist chapels. A cemetery, containing 1 ½ acres was opened in 1875, and is under the control of the Parish Council of Oakthorpe and Donisthorpe and Urban District Council of Moira. There is a colliery, worked by Messrs. Checkland, Son and Williams, and the brewery of G. and W. F. Cooper. The principal landowners are the trustees of the late Lord Donington (d. 1895), Sir Mylles Cave-Brown-Cave bart. of Stretton-en-le-Field, the trustees of the late William Turner, Messrs. W. F. Cooper, S. Greaves, Drewry and some small freeholders. The soil is mixed; subsoil, chiefly clay. The chief crops are wheat, barley and oats. The area is 1,785 acres of land and 20 of water; rateable value, including Oakthorpe, £6,671; the population of the township in 1891 was 1,678, and of the parish 2,955.

National School (mixed), erected in 1830, for 82 children; average attendance, 82.

Wesleyan School (mixed), erected in 1875 &amp; enlarged in 1894, for 142 children; average attendance, 130.A Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1852 and the Ordnance Survey map of 1884 shows one just north of the Engine Inn, the Mount Zion Chapel that was demolished in 2003. By 1908 there were two Primitive Methodist Chapels together with a Wesleyan chapel.

Donisthorpe Colliery closed in 1991. When the pit was operating the village had two post offices, five public houses, and 14 shops including a Coop Store (now the Scout Centre), a VG store, two butchers, a baker, a general store, a betting shop and a chip shop. At the time of pit closure in 1991 Donisthorpe contained four local shops, and a post office. Today the village has one shop (opened in 2014), and two pubs. Donisthorpe Miners&#x27; Welfare Centre closed during 2005, and since became a children&#x27;s fun centre. The former mine site was developed into a housing estate. The colliery site became the Donisthorpe Woodland Park. Further sites of former employment included a shoe factory and brickyard.
==Geography==
Donisthorpe is south-west of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, south of Swadlincote and from the Derbyshire border, at the heart of The National Forest. A former mining village, it is just under due east of Church Flatts Farm (near Coton-in-the-Elms, Derbyshire), the furthest point from coastal waters on the British mainland.

The historic county boundary between Leicestershire and Derbyshire is the River Mease, which runs less than south of Donisthorpe, with the village centre previously on the southern (Derbyshire) side, which formed part of an exclave of Derbyshire. Together with Measham and Oakthorpe, the village became part of Leicestershire in 1897 when administrative counties were established and now lies within the civil parish of Oakthorpe and Donisthorpe.

The Derbyshire town of Swadlincote, four miles to the north, is usually given as the nearest town for the purposes of the postal service, though the village is marginally closer to Ashby, to the north-east. Surrounding villages include Moira, Oakthorpe, Overseal, Netherseal, Acresford and Albert Village.

==Transport==
Donisthorpe was served by the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway which opened a station near Church Street in a deep cutting including three arch bridges. The line also had sidings to the colliery at Donisthorpe.

The station allowed passenger travel to Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Moira, Burton-Upon-Trent, Nuneaton, Hinckley and Coalville until 13 April 1934 when the line was closed to passengers. The line remained open to goods traffic until 1971, when the section from Measham to Shackerstone was closed by British Rail. The stub as far as Measham via Donisthorpe remained open to serve the colliery until 1981 when the stub near Overseal Junction was closed and lifted. The site was still traceable after closure of the stub but has since been filled in and forms a footpath from Measham to Spring Cottage via Donisthorpe and Moira.

The village is north of the northernmost junction of the M42 motorway (Junction 11), where it becomes the A42 towards East Midlands Airport and Nottingham.

==Landmarks==

St John the Evangelist Church was erected in 1938. It is a listed Grade II building, and within the ecclesiastical parish of Donisthorpe and Moira with Stretton-en-le-Field, Archdeaconry of Loughborough in the Diocese of Leicester. The last dedicated vicar vacated his position in 2006; the church is now part of a team ministry based in the nearby village of Measham. The vicarage house at Donisthorpe was sold but is also a Grade II building circa 1838

The church hall is opposite the church. It was originally the village school, donated by Sir John Cave, later converted to the church hall, and subsequently fell into disrepair and sold. The building has been converted to a private house.

Donisthorpe Memorial Park was opened as a War Memorial on 17 April 1920 by John Turner, High Sheriff of Leicestershire. The Grade II listed war memorial gateway was erected around 1922; subsequent names were added for the Second World War.

Donisthorpe Cemetery is registered with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission as having casualties (nine in total) from both the First and Second World Wars.

The late 17th-century timber framed thatched house, 58 New Street, was assessed in 1983 as a Grade II listed building. The house was badly damaged by fire in May 2011.

Donisthorpe Hall is early 18th Century and Grade II listed.

The Grange, 69 Church Street, a Grade II listed building, was thought to date from 1761 with early 19th-century additions. A survey in 2010 showed the building was built in the early 18th century, not 1761 as shown on the rainwater head. It has a fireplace dating from 1690 to 1730.

The Ashby Canal runs down the east side of the village.

<text>Lasius is a genus of formicine ants. The type species for this genus is the black garden ant, &quot;Lasius niger&quot;. Other major members, which live in drier heathland, are the cornfield ant, &quot;L. neoniger&quot;, and &quot;L. alienus&quot;. Other species include the temporary social parasites of the &quot;L. mixtus&quot; group and the hyper-social parasite &quot;Lasius fuliginosus&quot;. &quot;Lasius flavus&quot; is also a commonly seen species, building grassy hillocks in undisturbed pasture. In the Alps, these mounds – always aligned east to catch the first rays of the rising sun – have been traditionally used by goatherds as natural compasses. Species in the subgenus &quot;Acanthomyops&quot;, in particular &quot;L. interjectus&quot; and &quot;L. claviger&quot;, are commonly known as citronella ants due to their citronella-like smell.

== Social parasitism ==
Several species in this genus are noted to be social parasites. Some species such as &quot;Lasius latipes&quot; and &quot;Lasius murphyi&quot; are noted to have their mating flights in mid-late summer and invade other colonies of &quot;Lasius&quot;, primarily &quot;Lasius neoniger&quot;. Other species, such as &quot;Lasius claviger&quot;, are known to overwinter and invade colonies in the spring. 

==Moisture ants==
Many &quot;Lasius&quot; species, known collectively as &quot;moisture ants&quot; in the United States, make their nests in and around moist rotting wood as well as under rocks. They can infest buildings, particularly foundation forms in contact with soil, becoming a minor nuisance. They are not considered a structural threat because they only make their galleries in wood that is already decayed. Some species build &quot;cartonlike&quot; nests in moist locations made of decayed wood fragments cemented together with honeydew and the ant&#x27;s mandibular gland secretions. Workers are monomorphic, 2 to 3 mm long, yellow to dark brown. They are secretive, and forage mostly at night for honeydew and other sweet substances, and may also prey on small insects. Winged reproductive males and females swarm in late summer and fall, which is when building infestations may be noticed. They are distinguished from carpenter ants (&quot;Camponotus&quot;), another structure-infesting species, by being much smaller, and having a notch in the dorsal thorax (top of the center body division), where carpenter ants have a rounded thorax. Widespread moisture ant species include &quot;L. alienus&quot; and &quot;L. neoniger&quot;, as well as some &quot;Acanthomyops&quot; species.

<text>Henry Threadgill (born February 15, 1944) is an American composer, saxophonist and flautist. He came to prominence in the 1970s leading ensembles rooted in jazz but with unusual instrumentation and often incorporating other genres of music. He has performed and recorded with several ensembles: Air, Aggregation Orb, Make a Move, the seven-piece Henry Threadgill Sextett, the twenty-piece Society Situation Dance Band, Very Very Circus, X-75, and Zooid.

He was awarded the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his album &quot;In for a Penny, In for a Pound&quot;, which premiered at Roulette Intermedium on December 4, 2014.

In 2023, he published his autobiography, written with Brent Hayes Edwards: &quot;Easily Slip into Another World: A Life in Music.&quot; The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book of the Year, along with being a Best Book of the Year: &quot;The New York Times, NPR, The New Yorker&quot;.

==Career==
Threadgill performed as a percussionist in his high-school marching band before taking up baritone saxophone, alto saxophone, and flute. He studied at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, majoring in piano, flute, and composition. He studied piano with Gail Quillman and composition with Stella Roberts. He was an original member of the Experimental Band, a precursor to the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) in his hometown of Chicago, and worked under the guidance of Muhal Richard Abrams, before leaving to tour with a gospel band. In 1967, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, playing with a rock band in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in 1967 and 1968. He was discharged in 1969.

After returning to Chicago, Threadgill joined AACM members bassist Fred Hopkins and drummer Steve McCall in a trio which would eventually become the group Air. He moved to New York City, where he formed his first group, X-75, a nonet consisting of four reed players, four bass players, and a vocalist.

In the early 1980s, Threadgill created his first critically acclaimed ensemble as a leader, the Henry Threadgill Sextet (actually a septet; he counted the two drummers as a single percussion unit), which released three albums on About Time Records. After a hiatus, he formed New Air with Pheeroan akLaff, replacing Steve McCall on drums, and reformed the Henry Threadgill Sextett (with two t&#x27;s at the end). The six albums the group recorded feature some of his most accessible work, notably on the album &quot;You Know the Number&quot;. The group&#x27;s unorthodox instrumentation included two drummers, double bass, cello, trumpet, and trombone, in addition to Threadgill&#x27;s alto saxophone and flute. Among the players were drummers akLaff, John Betsch, Reggie Nicholson and Newman Baker; bassist Fred Hopkins; cellist Diedre Murray; trumpeters Rasul Siddik and Ted Daniels; cornetist Olu Dara; and trombonists Ray Anderson, Frank Lacy, Bill Lowe, and Craig Harris.

During the 1990s, Threadgill pushed the musical boundaries even further with his ensemble Very Very Circus. The group consisted of two tubas, two electric guitars, a trombone or French horn, and drums. With this group he explored more complex and highly structured forms of composition, augmenting the group with Latin percussion, French horn, violin, accordion, vocalists, and exotic instruments. He composed and recorded with other unusual instruments, such as a flute quartet (Flute Force Four, a one-time project from 1990); and combinations of four cellos and four acoustic guitars (on &quot;Makin&#x27; a Move&quot;).

He was signed by Columbia Records for three albums. Since the dissolution of Very Very Circus, Threadgill has continued in his iconoclastic ways with ensembles such as Make a Move and Zooid. Zooid, currently a sextet with tuba (Jose Davila), acoustic guitar (Liberty Ellman), cello (Christopher Hoffman), drums (Elliot Kavee) and bass guitar (Stomu Takeishi), has been the primary vehicle for Threadgill&#x27;s compositions in the 2000s.

In 2018, Threadgill composed the string quartet &quot;Sixfivetwo&quot; for the Kronos Quartet, which they recorded as part of their &quot;Fifty for the Future&quot; project.

==Awards and honors==
In 2016, Threadgill&#x27;s composition &quot;In for a Penny, In for a Pound&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music.

In July 2016, he received the Vietnam Veterans of America Excellence in the Arts Award, at the VVA National Leadership Conference in Tucson.

&quot;Run Silent, Run Deep, Run Loud, Run High&quot; (conducted by Hale Smith) and &quot;Mix for Orchestra&quot; (conducted by Dennis Russell Davies), were both premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1987 and 1993 respectively. He has had commissions from Mordine &amp; Company in 1971 and 1989, from Carnegie Hall for &quot;Quintet for Strings and Woodwinds&quot; in 1983 and 1985, the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1985, Bang on a Can All-Stars in 1995, &quot;Peroxide&quot; commissioned by the Miller Theatre Columbia University in 2003 for &quot;Aggregation Orb&quot;, a commission from the Talujon Percussion Ensemble in 2008, a piece &quot;Fly Fliegen Volar&quot; commissioned and premiered at the Saalfelden Jazz Festival with the Junge Philharmonie Salzburg Orchestra in 2007, a premier of the piece &quot;Mc Guffins&quot; with Zooid at the Biennale Festival in Italy in 2004.

In May 2020 he was presented with an honorary doctor of music by the University of Pennsylvania. 

In October 2020, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) announced Threadgill as one of four recipients of the NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships, celebrated in an online concert and show on April 22, 2021. Awarded in recognition of lifetime achievement, the honor is bestowed on individuals who have made significant contributions to the art form. The other 2021 recipients were Terri Lyne Carrington, Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath, and Phil Schaap.

In 2024 he received a PEN Oakland – Josephine Miles Award for &quot;Easily Slip Into Another World: A Life in Music&quot;, coauthored with Brent Hayes Edwards.

== Personal life ==
Threadgill was born in Chicago. He studied piano, flute, and composition at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, and Governors State University, in University Park, Illinois. He was a member of the US Army Concert Band, and served in Vietnam. He is married to recording artist and ethnomusicologist Senti Toy, also known as Sentienla Toy Threadgill.

<text>The Pearl Islands (Spanish: Archipiélago de las Perlas or Islas de las Perlas) is a group of 200 or more islands and islets (many tiny and uninhabited) lying about off the Pacific coast of Panama in the Gulf of Panama.

== Islands ==

The most notable island is Contadora Island (or Isla Contadora in Spanish), known for its resorts. Contadora was said to be used by the Spanish conquistadors as a stop for taking inventory of booty prior to returning to Spain, hence the name (&quot;contador&quot; means counter or bookkeeper in Spanish). Contadora is a resort island, with many homes owned by wealthy Panamanians. There are a large hotel and other cabins available. Most of the resort workers live on nearby Isla Saboga.

Domestic airline Air Panama no longer flies between Panama City and Contadora and Isla San José. FlyTrip, a new domestic airline, flies on Fridays and Sundays. While Sea de Las Perlas Ferry does daily trips to Contadora and Saboga islands ( which are islands near Las Perlas). This ferry also goes to Vivieros, San Miguel and Isla Bolaños. There are a few hotel options in Contadora which are mostly boutique hotels, bed and breakfasts, inns and some vacation homes. Saboga, Isla Bolaños, Viveros and Isla San Jose have lodging options. 

The largest island, at , is Isla del Rey (&quot;Island of the King&quot;), its name probably referring to Christ the King rather than to a secular king. Isla del Rey has several towns, most notably San Miguel. It is easily larger than the other Pearl Islands combined, and is the second largest island in Panama, after Coiba.

Other islands in the archipelago include Bolano Island, Buena Vista Island, Cana Island, Casaya Island, Chapera Island, Chitre Island, Cocos Island, Espiritu Santo Island, Galera Island, Gallo Island, Isla Gibraleón, Isla Bayoneta, Lampon Island, Marin Island, Mina Island, Mogo Mogo o Pajaro, Pacheca Island, Pachequille Island, Pedro Gonzalez Island, Puerco Island, Isla San José, Senora Island, Vivenda Island, and Viveros Island.

The island of Galera has a façade of very tall coconut palm trees and a white sandy beach. Strong currents, combined with shallows and jagged reefs surrounding the island, make navigation near the island perilous.

== History ==
Three million years ago the Isthmus of Panama was created. Until then North and South America were divided by sea. It was the biggest and reportedly the most significant geological event in 60 million years. Prior to that date as the Earth&#x27;s plates had begun to join the Pearl Islands were created and they emerged from the sea. On Contadora Island and other islands in the group pre-Columbian artifacts have been found.
The biggest island is Isla del Rey where more than fifteen pre-Columbian recognised archeological sites of the “Cuevas” and “Cocle” cultures have been identified. However, none of the original population remain.

The islands were first occupied by native populations who were (with their leader Terarequí) wiped out within two years of the islands&#x27; discovery by the Spanish. Spaniard Vasco Nunez de Balboa named the islands Pearl Islands on his discovery of them in 1513 due to the many pearls which were found there. Another Spaniard, Gaspar de Morales, part of a rogue group not under Balboa&#x27;s authority, murdered 20 local Indian chiefs not long after and gave them to his dogs to tear to pieces. The Spaniards then needed workers to harvest pearls and imported slave labour in the 16th century from Africa whose descendants now live on the islands, particularly del Rey.

The islands were frequently used by pirates in the following years and were relatively undisturbed until the 1960s and 1970s. The Shah of Iran retreated to the resort building on Contadora in 1979.

==Environment==
The Chamber for Sustainable Tourism Las Perlas aims to preserve the islands&#x27; delicate ecological balance.

===Important Bird Area===
The archipelago has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant breeding colonies of brown pelicans.

== Publicity ==
The Pearl Islands are a popular location for reality TV programs, particularly &quot;Survivor&quot;. The American edition has had 3 seasons (namely &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;) set on the islands. Season 2 of the Israeli version of the program (titled &quot;&quot;), season 1 of &quot;Survivor South Africa&quot; (titled &quot;Survivor South Africa: Panama&quot;), season 4 of the French edition (titled &quot;Koh-Lanta: Panama&quot;), season 3 of the Bulgarian version (titled &quot;Survivor BG: Pearl Islands&quot;) and Ukrainian versions of the show were all set on the islands.

Other programs, namely BBC TV series &quot;The Real Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, the British TV series &quot;The Island with Bear Grylls&quot; (which used the islands of Isla Gibraleón and Isla San Telmo) and season 1 of the Dutch television series &quot;Adam Looking for Eve&quot; used Mogo Mogo Island as location. The third season of &quot;The Challenge: All Stars&quot; filmed its final challenge on San José Island. MrBeast&#x27;s &quot;Beast Games&quot; also used Isla La Vivienda as a filming location.

<text>The Communist Party of Turkey (, TKP) was a political party in Turkey. The party was founded by Mustafa Suphi in 1920, and was soon to be banned. It worked as a clandestine opposition party throughout the Cold War era, and was persecuted by the various military regimes. Many intellectuals, like Nâzım Hikmet, joined the party&#x27;s ranks. In 1988, the party merged into the United Communist Party of Turkey, in an attempt to gain legal status. The TKP was active from 1920 until its dissolution in 1988, and it was banned in Turkey in 1925 in order to ensure the country&#x27;s security after the Sheikh Said Rebellion in Eastern Turkey. The party was legalized again after the Second World War, albeit with very limited power and it was heavily monitored by the Turkish government. However, after 1947 it was banned yet again and many of its leading figures were arrested and detained by the authorities. Initially adopting non-violent methods of introducing reform, the party began to adopt revolutionary viewpoints in the 1960s until its dissolution.

==Early history==

The party was founded at a congress in Baku on 10 September 1920, gathering together elements from three different left-wing tendencies influenced by the October Revolution in Russia. These founding tendencies were the Istanbul-based Turkish Workers and Peasants Socialist Party (), elements of the Green Army () in Anatolia (which represented the left-wing sectors of the national liberation movement), and a group of Turkish communists in Soviet Russia (largely made up by Turkish prisoners of war, who had been recruited by the Bolsheviks), including Süleyman Nuri. In total the congress was made up of 74 delegates. The congress elected Mustafa Suphi as the party chairman, and Ethem Nejat as the general secretary.

The party was formed by individuals who believed that the Ottoman Empire could no longer support its people, especially after the First World War. Its founding members were united in ending social injustice and economic inequality amongst the empire&#x27;s citizens, and to drive out the Western powers carving up Anatolia among themselves. Other notable members who played important roles in the TKP include Fuat Sabit and Şefik Hüsnü. Meanwhile, Nâzım Hikmet, the Turkish poet and intellectual, was active in the communist world and the TKP, meeting and working with individuals such as Vâlâ Nureddin, Ahmet Cevat, and Şevket Süreyya Aydemir. Most of the party&#x27;s members were learned individuals, and they did not belong to the military wing of the Ottoman Empire. Even at the lowest levels of the party, the members were Turkish nationalists who, after the October Revolution of 1917 in the Russian Empire, became heavily tied to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Hüsnü was inspired by the events of the 1905 Russian Revolution, and he adopted leftist ideology and viewpoints as a result.

Following the 1925 Sheikh Said rebellion, the TKP was banned in the country. Ismet İnönü, then the Prime Minister of Turkey, lead preparations for the government&#x27;s response to the rebellion. He took the Sheikh Said rebellion as an opportunity to crack down on all opposition that he deemed to be a threat against the new Turkish government, with the passing of the Law for the Maintenance of Order (Ottoman Turkish: &quot;Takrir-i Sükûn Kanunu&quot;). Turkey thus became a one-party state and the TKP was forced to go underground after they were banned.

After its foundation, the party was recognized as section of the Communist International (Comintern). The founding of TKP occurred in the midst of the Independence War, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the First World War.

In order to counter the growing influence of Turkish communists, Mustafa Kemal set up a parallel puppet communist party named Turkish Communist Party (). This provoked the founding of the People&#x27;s Communist Party of Turkey () in 1920. Although technically a separate party, the TKP cadres were also present in the leadership of the People&#x27;s Communist Party.

At the end of 1920, TKF applied for Comintern membership, but following the pressure by Communist Party of Turkey, TKF was not accepted to the 3rd World Congress of the Communist International as a member.

On 28 January 1921, the founders of TKP, Mustafa Suphi and his 14 other comrades, were murdered. It is not known who was behind the assassination. According to the official version, Mustafa Suphi was killed by the order of the Ottoman Sultan because of his support to the liberation of Turkey.

==Second congress==
In December 1921, the People&#x27;s Communist Party was legalized. This provided an opportunity for TKP to work in a more open manner. The People&#x27;s Communist Party held its congress in August, which the TKP considered as its second congress. The congress elected Salih Hacıoğlu as the party general secretary. The People&#x27;s Communist Party was banned the next month, and around 200 party cadres were arrested.

==Third congress==
The third party congress was held in Istanbul, in January 1925. The congress elected Şefik Hüsnü as the new general secretary. Hüsnü&#x27;s group in Istanbul had conducted semi-legal activities and published &quot;Aydınlık&quot;. On instructions from the Comintern, the party started to publish &quot;Orak-Çekiç&quot;, which in contrast to &quot;Aydınlık&quot; was directed towards the working class.

The sole delegate from the left of the party was Salih Hacıoğlu, who would later perish in the purges in Russia during the 1930s.

The TKP suffered three waves of crackdowns on its cadres, in 1925, 1927 and 1929. But in addition to the external pressure, the party also suffered from internal divisions. The role of the party towards the Comintern and the governing CHP party were issues of disputes.

Albeit an illegal party, the TKP issued a series of publications like &quot;Kızıl Istanbul&quot; (1930–1935), &quot;Bolşevik&quot; (1927), &quot;Komünist&quot; (1929) and &quot;İnkılap Yolu&quot; (published in Berlin 1930–1932). The party organized a party conference in Vienna in 1926, where a new party program was formulated, which was more critical towards Kemalism.

==Fourth congress==
The fourth TKP congress was held in 1932. Hüsnü was reelected as the party general secretary.

==Collapse and resurgence==
In 1951, the TKP effectively collapsed after many of its leaders were arrested by the authorities. Thereafter, in order to keep a low profile in Turkey, the party established a foreign bureau that had connections to Moscow. Mihri Belli, a Turkish revolutionary, claimed that he was assigned this task to establish this foreign bureau. This order would make him the de facto leader of the party, a title he refused to adopt.

In the 1960s the Workers Party of Turkey (&quot;Türkiye İşçi Partisi&quot;) emerged as a strong force. The foundation of TİP occurred as there was a relatively more open political atmosphere at the time. TİP became a leading force within the trade union movement, leading the Confederation of Revolutionary Trade Unions (DISK), which was founded in 1967. In addition to that, TİP became the first Turkish political party that put the Kurdish Question into its agenda.

However, as the political situation became yet more intense, and the more radical wings of the left movement opted for armed struggle, TİP was banned. The banning of TİP would strengthen the TKP, as many TİP cadres now joined the underground TKP instead. It led semi-legal mass organizations, and became the leading force within DİSK.

After the 1960 coup d&#x27;état, the government adopted a new constitution that allowed more political freedoms than ever before, or since the country&#x27;s founding. Despite this, open communists were still restricted in legally organizing, and this heavily applied to the TKP. The TKP believed that change could be implemented through democratic reforms, but after 1960 the party adopted a more revolutionary approach, even if it was not as politically active when compared to the 1920s.

==Atılım era==
At the beginning of the 1970s, labour organisations and left wing political parties faced with the despotism of 1971 Turkish coup d&#x27;état. Despite the pressure of the military junta, this communist movement rose and changed the political situation in Turkey. The riots of the university students in 1968, and the big strike of workers in 15–16 June 1970, became major sources of inspiration for this event. Under the leadership of General Secretary İsmail Bilen, the TKP saw this trend as a new era of revolution and reform, so named it as &quot;Atılım&quot; which means &quot;leap&quot; in Turkish. Despite the party&#x27;s illegality, and the problems of working underground, the TKP found a way to intervene in the political agenda of the country with the support of DISK. This era of progress for TKP and the other left wing organisations in Turkey was ended by the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état.

==Fifth congress==
The fifth TKP congress was held in 1983. İsmail Bilen was elected as party chairman and Haydar Kutlu as general secretary. TKP criticized the US intervention in Lebanon, Nicaragua and El Salvador.

==Dissolution and merger into TBKP==
As a result of the 1980 military coup, left-wing and communist parties were forced to go underground. The TKP merged with the TİP and formed the United Communist Party of Turkey (TBKP) in 1988 under the motto &quot;unity, renewal and legality&quot;. Both of the leaders the TKP and TİP, Haydar Kutlu and Nihat Sargın respectively, returned from their political exile in on 16 November 1987 to establish the new TKBP, but they were immediately arrested and held in custody until April 1990. The political atmosphere in Turkey was more restrictive than in previous years, so much so that the European Parliament stated that &quot;recognizing that a political democracy cannot yet be considered to exist in Turkey while major political parties remain unrepresented in the country&#x27;s parliament, while leading political figures were excluded from active political life, while the Turkish Communist Party remains under a total ban.&quot; Due to the ban on communist political activities in Turkey, the TBKP initially had to be formed in a clandestine congress, immediately following the sixth congress of TKP simultaneously with the congress of TİP. But from the outset, it stated its aim to operate legally.

In 1990, its leaders officially established the TBKP as a formal political party, which would be banned the next year after a lengthy court case. Nevertheless, before it was banned, the TBKP had already held a legal congress in January 1991, and in this congress a resolution was overwhelmingly adopted calling on all its members to join a project to form a broader-based socialist party, the Socialist Unity Party, which would itself eventually evolve, after a series of subsequent mergers, into the Freedom and Solidarity Party. However the Freedom and Solidarity Party also experienced more splits leaving the party with no links to the historical Communist Party of Turkey.

==Claims of heritage==
Currently there are several factions in Turkey that claim to represent the historical TKP:
* the TKP that separated in 1979 from the main TKP and became known after the periodical &quot;İşçinin Sesi&quot; (Worker&#x27;s Voice) which they issued;
* current TKP, which adopted the name in 2001, founded as the Party for Socialist Power (SİP) in 1993, which has no organisational link with the historical TKP. 
* a grouping of some dissident members of the TBKP who held a &quot;rebirth meeting&quot; in 1993, started to publish the periodical &quot;Ürün Sosyalist Dergi&quot; (&quot;Harvest Socialist Magazine&quot;). Actually, in the aim of giving out the voice of TKP through a legal path, the first publication of &quot;Ürün Sosyalist Dergi&quot; was made in 1974, but the martial law authority banned its publication in 1980. After the &quot;rebirth meeting&quot; in 1993, the contributors of the meeting restarted the periodicals publication in 1997. Almost after a decade, the group which summoned up around this publication, expanded enough to reestablish the TKP again. In 2012, they officially announced the reestablishment of the TKP. But this initiative resulted as a dichotomy, because of the existence of another party (Former SIP) which started to use the same name in 2001. So the contributors of the rebirth initiative decided to change the official name of the TKP as 1920 TKP.

<text>James Leonard Farmer Jr. (January 12, 1920 – July 9, 1999) was an American civil rights activist and leader in the Civil Rights Movement &quot;who pushed for nonviolent protest to dismantle segregation, and served alongside Martin Luther King Jr.&quot; He was the initiator and organizer of the first Freedom Ride in 1961, which eventually led to the desegregation of interstate transportation in the United States.

In 1942, Farmer co-founded the Committee of Racial Equality in Chicago along with George Houser, James R. Robinson, Samuel E. Riley, Bernice Fisher, Homer Jack, and Joe Guinn. It was later called the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and was dedicated to ending racial segregation in the United States through nonviolence. Farmer served as the national chairman from 1942 to 1944.

By the 1960s, Farmer was known as &quot;one of the Big Four civil rights leaders in the 1960s, together with King, NAACP chief Roy Wilkins and Urban League head Whitney Young.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
James L. Farmer Jr. was born in Marshall, Texas, to James L. Farmer Sr. and Pearl Houston, who were both educators. His father was a professor at Wiley College, a historically black college, and a Methodist minister with a Ph.D. in theology from Boston University. His mother, a homemaker, was a graduate of Florida&#x27;s Bethune-Cookman Institute and a former teacher.

When Farmer was a young boy, about three or four, he wanted a Coca-Cola when he was out in town with his mother. His mother had adamantly told him no, that he had to wait until they got home. Farmer wanted a Coke immediately and enviously watched another young boy go inside and buy one. His mother told him the other boy could buy the Coke at that store because he was white, but Farmer was a person of color and not allowed there. This defining, unjust moment was the first, but not the last, experience that Farmer remembered of segregation.

When Farmer was ten, Farmer&#x27;s Uncle Fred, Aunt Helen, and cousin Muriel came down to visit from New York. They had no trouble getting a sleeping compartment on the train down but were worried about getting one on the way back. Farmer went to the train station with his dad. While his father convinced the manager to give his uncle a room in the sleeping car on the train, Farmer realized that his dad was lying. Farmer was shocked to hear the lies, as his father was a minister. On the way back, his father told him, &quot;I had to tell that lie about your Uncle Fred. That was the only way we could get the reservation. The Lord will forgive me.&quot; Still, Farmer was very upset that his father had to lie to get the bedroom on the train. This was when Farmer began to dedicate his life to ending segregation.

Farmer was a child prodigy; in 1934, at the age of 14, he enrolled as a freshman at Wiley College, a historically black college in Marshall, Texas at which his father was teaching. He was selected as part of the debate team. Melvin B. Tolson, a professor of English, became his mentor.

===Adult life===
At the age of 21, Farmer was invited to the White House to talk with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eleanor Roosevelt signed the invitation. Before the talk with the president, Mrs. Roosevelt talked to the group. Farmer took a liking to her immediately, and the two of them monopolized the conversation. When the group went in to talk to President Roosevelt, Mrs. Roosevelt followed and sat in the back. After the formalities were done, the young people were allowed to ask questions. Farmer said, &quot;On your opening remarks you described Britain and France as champions of freedom. In light of their colonial policies in Africa, which give the lie to the principle, how can they be considered defenders?&quot; The president tactfully avoided the question. Mrs Roosevelt spoke up, saying, &quot;Just a minute, you did not answer the question!&quot; Although the president still did not answer the question as Farmer phrased it, Farmer was placated knowing that he had gotten the question out there.

Farmer earned a Bachelor of Science degree at Wiley College in 1938, and a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Howard University School of Religion in 1941. At Wiley, Farmer became anguished over segregation, recalling particular occasions of racism he had witnessed or suffered in his younger days. During the Second World War, Farmer had official status as a conscientious objector.

Inspired by Howard Thurman, a professor of theology at Howard University, Farmer became interested in Gandhi-style pacifism. Martin Luther King Jr. also studied this later and adopted many of its principles. Farmer started to think about how to stop racist practices in America while working at the Fellowship of Reconciliation, which he joined after college.

During the 1950s, Farmer served as national secretary of the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID), the youth branch of the socialist League for Industrial Democracy. SLID later became Students for a Democratic Society.

Farmer married Winnie Christie in 1945. Winnie became pregnant soon after they were married. Then she found a note from a girl in one of Farmer&#x27;s coat pockets, an event that catalyzed the end of their marriage. She miscarried, and the couple divorced not long afterward.

A few years later, Farmer married Lula A. Peterson. She had been diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, so the two were told not to have children because at that time pregnancy was thought to exacerbate cancer. Years later, they sought a second opinion. At that time, Lula was encouraged to try to have children. She had a miscarriage but then successfully had a daughter, Tami Lynn Farmer, born on February 14, 1959. A second daughter, Abbey Farmer, was born in 1962.

===Founding CORE===
James Farmer later recalled:

I talked to A. J. Muste, executive director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), about an idea to combat racial inequality. Muste found the idea promising but wanted to see it in writing. I spent months writing the memorandum making sure it was perfect. A. J. Muste wrote me back asking me about money to fund it and how they would get members. Finally, I was asked to propose my idea in front of the FOR National Council. In the end, FOR chose not to sponsor the group, but they gave me permission to start the group in Chicago. When Farmer got back to Chicago, the group began setting up the organization. The name they picked was CORE, the Committee of Racial Equality. The name was changed about a year later to the Congress of Racial Equality.

In an interview with Robert Penn Warren in 1964 for the book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?,&quot; Farmer described the founding principles of CORE as follows: 
:1. that it involves the people themselves rather than experts, 
:2. that it rejects segregation, and 
:3. that it does so through nonviolent direct action.

Jack Spratt was a local diner in Chicago that would not serve colored people. CORE decided to do a large-scale sit in where they would occupy all available seats. Twenty-eight persons entered Jack Spratt in groups, with at least one black person in each group. No one who was served would eat until the black people were served, or they gave their plate to the black person nearest them. The other customers, already in the diner, did the same. The manager told them that they would serve the colored customers in the basement, but the group declined. Then it was proposed that all the colored people sit in the back corner and get served there, again the group declined. Finally, the establishment called the police. When the police entered, they refused to kick the CORE group out. Having no other options, all patrons were served. Afterward, CORE did tests at Jack Spratt and found that the diner&#x27;s policy had changed.

The White City Roller Skating Rink allowed only white patrons. Its staff made excuses to blacks as to why they could not enter. For example, white CORE members were allowed to enter the rink, but black members were refused because of &quot;a private party&quot;. Having documented that the rink was lying about the circumstances, CORE decided to sue them. When the case went to trial, a state lawyer conducted the prosecution, rather than the county. The judge ruled in favor of the rink. Although the outcome of the case was a setback for CORE, the group was making a name for itself.

===Freedom Rides===

In 1961, Farmer, who was working for the NAACP, was reelected as the national director of CORE, as the civil rights movement was gaining power. Although the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia,&quot; 328 U.S. 373 (1946) had ruled that segregated interstate bus travel was unconstitutional, and reiterated that in &quot;Boynton v. Virginia&quot; (1960), interstate buses enforced segregation below the Mason–Dixon line (in Southern states). Gordon Carey proposed the idea of a second Journey of Reconciliation and Farmer jumped at the idea. This time, the group planned to journey through the Deep South. Farmer coined a new name for the trip: the Freedom Ride.

They planned for a mixed-race and -gender group to test segregation on interstate buses. The group would be trained extensively on nonviolent tactics in Washington, D.C., and embark on May 4, 1961: half by each of the two major carriers, Greyhound Bus Company and Trailways. They would ride through Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and finish in New Orleans on May 17. They planned to challenge segregated seating in bus stations and lunch rooms as well. For overnight stops they planned rallies and support from the black community, and scheduled talks at local churches or colleges.

On May 4, the participants began. The trip down through Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia went smoothly enough. The states knew about the trip and facilities either took down the &quot;Colored&quot; and &quot;White Only&quot; signs, or didn&#x27;t enforce the segregation laws. Before the group made it to Alabama, the most dangerous part of the Freedom Ride, Farmer had to return home because his father died. In Alabama, the other riders were severely beaten and abused, narrowly escaping death when their bus was firebombed. With the bus destroyed, they flew to New Orleans instead of finishing the ride.

Diane Nash and other members of the Nashville Student Movement and SNCC quickly recruited college students to restart the Freedom Ride where the first had left off. Farmer rejoined the group in Montgomery, Alabama. Doris Castle persuaded him to get on the bus at the last minute. The Riders were met with severe violence; in Birmingham the sheriff allowed local KKK members several minutes to attack the Riders, badly injuring a photographer. The violent reactions and events attracted national media attention.

Their efforts sparked a summer of similar rides by other Civil Rights leaders and thousands of ordinary citizens. In Jackson, Mississippi, Farmer and the other riders were immediately jailed, but law enforcement prevented violence. The riders followed a &quot;jail no bail&quot; philosophy to try to fill the jails with protesters and attract media attention. From county and town jails, the riders were sent to harsher conditions at Parchman State Penitentiary. As the Freedom Rides were attacked by whites, news coverage became widespread, and included photographs, newspaper accounts, and motion pictures. The Congress of Racial Equality and segregation and civil rights became national issues. Farmer became well known as a civil-rights leader. The Freedom Rides inspired Erin Gruwell&#x27;s teaching techniques and the Freedom Writers Foundation.

The following year, civil rights groups, supplemented by hundreds of college students from the North, worked with local activists in Mississippi on voter registration and education. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, all of whom Farmer had helped recruit for CORE, disappeared during the Mississippi Freedom Summer. A full-scale FBI investigation aided by other law enforcement, found their murdered corpses buried in an earthen dam. The murders inspired the 1988 feature movie, &quot;Mississippi Burning.&quot; Years later, recalling the event, Farmer said, &quot;Anyone who said he wasn&#x27;t afraid during the civil rights movement was either a liar or without imagination. I think we were all scared. I was scared all the time. My hand didn&#x27;t shake but inside I was shaking.&quot;

===Later career===
In 1963, Louisiana state troopers hunted for Farmer door to door for trying to organize protests. A funeral home director had Farmer play dead in the back of a hearse that carried him along back roads and out of town. He was arrested that August for disturbing the peace.

As the Director of CORE, Farmer was considered one of the &quot;Big Six&quot; of the Civil Rights Movement who helped organize the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. (The press also used the term &quot;Big Four&quot;, ignoring John Lewis and Dorothy Height.)
Growing disenchanted with emerging militancy and black nationalist sentiments in CORE, Farmer resigned as director in 1966. By that time, Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ending legal segregation, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, authorizing federal enforcement of registration and elections.

Farmer took a teaching position at Lincoln University, a historically black college (HBCU) near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He also lectured around the country. In 1968, Farmer ran for U.S. Congress as a Liberal Party candidate backed by the Republican Party, but lost to Shirley Chisholm.

In 1969, the newly elected Republican President Richard Nixon offered Farmer the position of Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now Health and Human Services). The next year, frustrated by the Washington bureaucracy, Farmer resigned from the position.

Farmer retired from politics in 1971 but remained active, lecturing and serving on various boards and committees. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II in 1973. In 1975, he co-founded Fund for an Open Society. Its vision is a nation in which people live in stably integrated communities, where political and civic power is shared by people of different races and ethnicities. He led this organization until 1999.

Farmer was named an honorary vice chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America.

He published his autobiography &quot;Lay Bare the Heart&quot; in 1985. In 1984, Farmer began teaching at Mary Washington College (now The University of Mary Washington) in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

Farmer retired from his teaching position in 1998. He died on July 9, 1999, of complications from diabetes in Fredericksburg, Virginia at the age of 79.

Academics and the participants unanimously agreed that the founders of CORE were James Farmer, George Houser and Bernice Fisher. The conference has been preserved on videotape available from Bluffton College.

<text>Chudleigh Knighton is a small village in Devon, England, near to Newton Abbot and Bovey Tracey.

==Amenities==
Chudleigh Knighton Church of England Primary School has around 167 pupils, aged 5 to 11. The school has six classrooms on two floors.

There is a village hall, a hairdressers, and a public house, &quot;The Claycutter&#x27;s Arms&quot;. A second public house, &quot;The Anchor&quot;, burned down in March 2015. A fair is held in early July.

==Transport==
Chudleigh Knighton is served by bus services from Newton Abbot and Exeter. The village used to have a railway station, Chudleigh Knighton Halt, on the Teign Valley Line. The station opened on 9 June 1924 and closed on 9 June 1958.

==Chudleigh Knighton Heath==
The nearby Chudleigh Knighton Heath, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is a habitat for many rare species including the ant, &quot;Formica exsecta&quot;. The Heath was once the village&#x27;s main football pitch and was the venue for many sports days for the primary school. The Heath became so run down it was almost impossible to navigate, so the school opened its own private sports field opposite the village play park.

<doc id="327317" wikidata="Q47159" url="?curid=327317" title="Nate Dogg">
<text>Nathaniel Dwayne Hale (August 19, 1969 – March 15, 2011), known professionally as Nate Dogg, was an American singer and rapper. Hale gained recognition for providing guest vocals on several hit rap songs between 1992 and 2007, earning the nickname &quot;King of Hooks&quot;.

Hale began his career in 1990 as a member of 213, a hip-hop trio formed with his cousin Snoop Dogg and friend Warren G. Hale guest appeared on the latter&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;Regulate&quot;, which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards. Hale would soon become a fixture in the West Coast hip-hop genre, frequently collaborating with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Xzibit in the 1990s; his deep vocals became sought after for hooks, and he began working with other artists throughout the 2000s, such as Eminem, 50 Cent, Fabolous, Mos Def, and Ludacris. As a featured artist, Hale performed on 16 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart entries, which includes his appearance on the number one-single &quot;21 Questions&quot; by 50 Cent. Hale also guest appeared on the singles &quot;The Next Episode&quot; by Dr. Dre, as well as &quot;&#x27;Till I Collapse&quot; and &quot;Shake That&quot; by Eminem. Hale released three studio albums, as well as a string of moderately successful singles as a primary artist in the 1990s.

==Early life==
Nathaniel Dwayne Hale was born on August 19, 1969, in Long Beach, California. Hale met Warren G at Long Beach Polytechnic High School. As a youth, he sang at the New Hope Baptist Church in Long Beach, where his father was a pastor. He also sang at Life Line Baptist Church in Clarksdale, Mississippi.

At age 17, Hale dropped out of high school, left home, and 30 days later enlisted in the US Marines. He was stationed at Camp Schwab in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, in the Matériel Readiness Battalion of the 3rd Force Service Support Group, which supplied ammunition to most of the Pacific. After three years as an ammunition specialist, he was discharged in 1989. Hale would recall that he joined the military because he &quot;wanted to see if he was a man&quot;.

==Musical career==
===213===
In 1990, Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, and Warren G formed a rap trio called 213. They recorded their first demo tape in the back of record store V.I.P. in Long Beach. The demo was later heard by Dr. Dre at a bachelor party.

===Solo career===
Nate Dogg debuted on Dr. Dre&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Chronic&quot;, in 1992. Nate&#x27;s trademark singing, complementing the new gangsta rap sound G-funk, was well received by critics. He signed to Dr. Dre&#x27;s label, Death Row Records, in 1993. Nate Dogg also featured on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, in 1993, his singing prominent on the track &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Fun (If the Homies Can&#x27;t Have None)&quot;.

In 1994, Nate Dogg co-wrote his duet with Warren G, the single &quot;Regulate&quot;. That same year, Nate also featured on &quot;How Long Will They Mourn Me?&quot; from Thug Life&#x27;s album &quot;Thug Life, Volume I&quot;. In July 1998, amid his departure from Death Row, the label released his double album, delayed about two years, &quot;G-Funk Classics, Vol. 1 &amp; 2&quot;. In 2001, his Elektra Records follow-up, &quot;Music &amp; Me&quot;, peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. He also had an eponymous album that saw unauthorized release in 2003.

Nate Dogg was often sought to sing on other artists&#x27; tracks, usually to sing the hook. As a featured artist, he charted 16 times on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and in 2003 reached No. 1 via 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;21 Questions&quot;.

Otherwise, his successful collaborations are numerous, including 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;All Bout U&quot;, Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Next Episode&quot;, Westside Connection&#x27;s &quot;Gangsta Nation&quot;, Mos Def&#x27;s &quot;Oh No&quot;, Fabolous&#x27; &quot;Can&#x27;t Deny It&quot;, Ludacris&#x27; &quot;Area Codes&quot;, Kurupt&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Walls&quot;, Mark Ronson&#x27;s &quot;Ooh Wee&quot;, Houston&#x27;s &quot;I Like That&quot;, Eminem&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Till I Collapse&quot;, &quot;Never Enough&quot;, and &quot;Shake That&quot;, and Mobb Deep&#x27;s &quot;Have a Party&quot;.

Further, in 2002, appearing on television, Nate Dogg was on a celebrity episode of &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, where, finally eliminated by Xzibit and Young MC, he was among the final three.

==Artistry==
Hale was known for his deep, melodic vocals, with his music often described as a mix between R&amp;B and hip-hop, and his vocal range between tenor and baritone. Hale himself considered his voice and style to be mostly influenced by the gospel music he performed in the church choir as a child, though he also grew up listening to soul and cited Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Maurice White of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire as some of his biggest musical influences.

He is considered to be the inventor of &quot;gangsta singing&quot;, a singing style that consisted in the blend of R&amp;B and soul vocals with gangsta rap lyrics. The style was heavily influential to urban culture, with major R&amp;B artists like R. Kelly and Chris Brown later using it.

==Legal issues==
Hale was charged for a 1991 robbery of a Check Changers shop and for a 1994 robbery of Taco Bell in San Pedro, but was acquitted.

In 1996, he was convicted of a drug offense in Los Angeles County.

On June 17, 2000, for allegedly assaulting his former girlfriend and setting her mother&#x27;s car on fire in Lakewood, Hale was charged with kidnapping, domestic violence, terrorist threats, and arson. Dr. Dre posted a $1 million bond. The charges were dismissed while he pleaded no contest to illegal gun possession by a felon, and received a $1,000 fine and three years&#x27; probation.

On April 12, 2002, a tour bus carrying Hale, while outside of Kingman, Arizona, was found with two pistols and four ounces of cannabis, whereby he was booked and then released on $3,500 bond. The next month, the weapon charges were dropped for his guilty plea on a drug charge, and he was sentenced to probation, community service, and drug counseling.

In July 2006, Hale was charged with misdemeanor aggravated trespassing, telephone harassment, battery assault, dissuading a witness from reporting a crime, and breaking a restraining order. On March 20, 2008, pleading guilty to trespassing and battery, he lost gun-ownership rights for ten years, received three years&#x27; probation, and was ordered to a domestic-violence intervention program.

On June 23, 2008, after allegedly threatening his estranged wife by emails and chasing her on Interstate 405, Hale was charged with two felony counts of criminal threats and one count of stalking. He pleaded not guilty. In April 2009, as the alleged victim had failed to contact prosecutors, the charges were dropped. Incidentally, he was also convicted of driving under the influence of drugs.

==Health problems and death==

On December 19, 2007, Hale suffered a stroke. After a week in Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, he entered a rehabilitation facility. Although his body&#x27;s left side was weakened, neither his cognition nor voice were affected and he was expected to fully recover. Hale suffered another stroke on September 12, 2008. 

On March 15, 2011, Hale died at age 41 in Long Beach of complications of multiple strokes; another, or contributing, suspected cause of death was congestive heart failure. He was interred in Long Beach at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

==Legacy==
In 2013, Nate Dogg&#x27;s son Naijiel Hale was committed to play football at the University of Washington. A couple of years later, in 2015, Nate&#x27;s other son, Nathaniel Jr., having adopted the stage name Lil Nate Dogg, released his own album, &quot;Son of a G&quot;. Naijiel would also begin to create music, adopting the stage name NHale, and released his debut studio album, &quot;Young OG&quot;, in 2020.

It was reported a posthumous and final studio album entitled &quot;Nate Dogg: It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; was announced in 2012, with a late spring or early summer 2013 release from Seven Arts Music and United Media &amp; Music Group. As of 2025, the album has not been released and no further announcements have been made.

<text>The Oregon Treaty was a treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States that was signed on June 15, 1846, in Washington, D.C. The treaty brought an end to the Oregon boundary dispute by settling competing American and British claims to the Oregon Country; the area had been jointly occupied by both Britain and the U.S. since the Treaty of 1818.

== Background ==
The Treaty of 1818 set the boundary between the United States and British North America along the 49th parallel of north latitude from Minnesota to the &quot;Stony Mountains&quot; (now known as the Rocky Mountains). The region west of those mountains was known to the Americans as the Oregon Country and to the British as the Columbia Department or Columbia District of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. (Also included in the region was the southern portion of another fur district, New Caledonia.) The treaty provided for joint control of that land for ten years. Both countries could claim land and both were guaranteed free navigation throughout.

Joint control steadily grew less tolerable for both sides. After a British minister rejected the offer of U.S. Presidents James K. Polk and John Tyler to settle the boundary at the 49th parallel north, American expansionists of the &quot;All Oregon&quot; movement called for the annexation of the entire region up to Parallel 54°40′ north, the southern limit of Russian America as established by parallel treaties between the Russian Empire and the United States (1824) and Britain (1825). However, after the outbreak of the Mexican–American War in April 1846 diverted U.S. attention and military resources, a compromise was reached in the ongoing negotiations in Washington, D.C., and the matter was then settled by the Polk administration (to the surprise of its own party&#x27;s hardliners) to avoid a two-war situation, and another war with the formidable military strength of the United Kingdom.

== Senate vote in June 1846 ==

In early June 1846 the British offered to negotiate the boundaries between the United States and British North America in the region west of the Rockies. Some US senators such as Charles Gordon Atherton and Benning Wentworth Jenness were combative and were in favor of rejecting British proposals to negotiate. However others, such as both Alabama senators (Arthur P. Bagby and Dixon Hall Lewis) as well as both Massachusetts senators (Daniel Webster and John Davis) were in favor of accepting British proposals. The Senate agreed that they would vote on whether or not to recommend President Polk accept British offers to negotiate. Watching closely, the British hoped this vote would pass the Senate. On June 12, the Senate voted 38–12 recommending that President Polk accept British proposals to negotiate this boundary. Votes in favor included 18 Democrats and 20 Whigs, whereas 11 Democrats and one Whig voted against. Three Democrats and three Whigs abstained.

==Negotiations==
The treaty was negotiated by US Secretary of State and future President James Buchanan and Richard Pakenham, British envoy to the United States. Foreign Secretary Earl of Aberdeen was responsible for it in Parliament. The treaty was signed on June 15, 1846, ending the joint occupation and making Oregonians south of the 49th parallel American citizens, with those north of it becoming British.

The Oregon Treaty set the border between the U.S. and British North America at the 49th parallel with the exception of Vancouver Island, which was retained in its entirety by the British. Vancouver Island, with all coastal islands, was constituted as the Colony of Vancouver Island in 1849. The U.S. portion of the region was organized as Oregon Territory on August 15, 1848, with Washington Territory being formed from it in 1853. The British portion remained unorganized until 1858, when the Colony of British Columbia was set up as a result of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and fears of the re-asserted American expansionist intentions. The two British colonies were amalgamated in 1866 as the Colony of British Columbia. When the Colony of British Columbia joined Canada in 1871, the 49th parallel and marine boundaries established by the Oregon Treaty became the Canada–US border.

In order to ensure that Britain retained all of Vancouver Island and the southern Gulf Islands, it was agreed that the border would swing south around that area. Ownership of several channel islands, including the San Juan Islands remained in dispute. A bloodless confrontation known as the Pig War erupted in 1859 over ownership of the San Juans, which was not resolved until 1872. Ultimately, arbitration began with German Emperor Wilhelm I as head of a three-man arbitration commission. On October 21, 1872, the commission decided in favor of the United States, awarding the San Juan Islands to the U.S.

==Treaty definitions==

The treaty states that the border in the Strait of Juan de Fuca would follow “the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver&#x27;s Island.” It did not, however, specify which of several possible channels was intended, giving rise to ownership disputes over the San Juan Islands beginning in 1859.

Other provisions included:
* Navigation of &quot;channel[s] and straits, south of the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, remain free and open to both parties&quot;.
* The &quot;Puget&#x27;s Sound Agricultural Company&quot; (a subsidiary of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company) retains the right to their property north of the Columbia River, and shall be compensated for properties surrendered if required by the United States.
* The property rights of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and all British subjects south of the new boundary will be respected.

==Issues arising from treaty==

Ambiguities in the wording of the Oregon Treaty regarding the route of the boundary, which was to follow &quot;the deepest channel&quot; out to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and beyond to the open ocean, resulted in the Pig War, another boundary dispute in 1859 over the San Juan Islands. The dispute was peacefully resolved after a decade of confrontation and military bluster during which the local British authorities consistently lobbied London to seize back the Puget Sound region entirely, as the Americans were busy elsewhere with the Civil War. The San Juans dispute was not resolved until 1872 when, pursuant to the 1871 Treaty of Washington, an arbitrator (William I, German Emperor) chose the American-preferred marine boundary via Haro Strait, to the west of the islands, over the British preference for Rosario Strait which lay to their east.

The treaty also had the unintended consequence of putting what became Point Roberts, Washington on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the border. A peninsula, jutting south from Canada into Boundary Bay, was made by the agreement, as land south of the 49th parallel, a separate fragment of the United States.

According to American historian Thomas C. McClintock, the British public welcomed the treaty:

<text>Primitive Baptists – also known as Regular Baptists, Old School Baptists, Foot Washing Baptists, or, derisively, Hard Shell Baptists – are conservative Baptists adhering to a degree of Calvinist beliefs who coalesced out of the controversy among Baptists in the early 19th century over the appropriateness of mission boards, tract societies, and temperance societies. Primitive Baptists are a subset of the Calvinistic Baptist tradition. The adjective &quot;primitive&quot; in the name is used in the sense of &quot;original&quot;.

==History==
The controversy over whether churches or their members should participate in mission boards, Bible tract societies, and temperance societies led the Primitive Baptists to separate from other general Baptist groups that supported such organizations, and to make declarations of opposition to such organizations in articles like the &quot;Kehukee Association Declaration of 1827&quot;. The Kehukee Primitive Baptist Church released a proclamation that they rejected formal service institutions outside of the church. The declaration proposed that 
Upon examination, it was found that most of the churches had given their opinions; and after an interchange of sentiments among the members of this body, it was agreed that we discard all Missionary Societies, Bible Societies and Theological Seminaries, and the practices heretofore resorted to for their support, in begging money from the public; and if any persons should be among us, as agents of any of said societies, we hereafter discountenance them in those practices; and if under a character of a minister of the gospel, we will not invite them into our pulpits; believing these societies and institutions to be the inventions of men, and not warranted from the word of God. We further do unanimously agree that should any of the members of our churches join the fraternity of Masons, or, being members, continue to visit the lodges and parades, we will not invite them to preach in our pulpits, believing them to be guilty of such practices; and we declare non-fellowship with them and such practices altogether.

The official split between &quot;Old School&quot; and &quot;New School&quot; Baptists occurred during a meeting at the Black Rock Church on September 28, 1832 in Butler, MD. This became known as the Black Rock Address.

Primitive Baptist churches arose in the mountainous regions of the American South, where they are found in their greatest numbers.

African-American Primitive Baptist groups have been considered a unique category of Primitive Baptist. Approximately 50,000 African Americans are affiliated with African-American Primitive Baptist churches as of 2005. Approximately 64,000 people were affiliated (as of 1995) with Primitive Baptist churches in the various other emergences of Primitive Baptists.

Since arising in the 19th century, the influence of Primitive Baptists has waned as &quot;Missionary Baptists became the mainstream&quot;.

==Theological views==
Primitive Baptists reject some elements of classical Reformed theology, such as infant baptism, and avoid the term &quot;Calvinist&quot;. They are still Calvinist in the sense of holding strongly to the Five Points of Calvinism and they explicitly reject Arminianism. They are also characterized by &quot;intense conservatism&quot;.

One branch, the Primitive Baptist Universalist church of central Appalachia, developed their own unique Trinitarian Universalist theology as an extension of the irresistible grace doctrine of Calvinist theology. They were encouraged in this direction by 19th century itinerant Christian universalist preachers of similar theological bent to Hosea Ballou and John Murray.

==Distinct practices==
Primitive Baptist practices that are distinguishable from those of other Baptists include a cappella singing, family integrated worship, and foot washing.

===A cappella singing===
Primitive Baptists generally do not play musical instruments as part of their worship services. They believe that all church music should be a cappella because there is no New Testament command to play instruments, but only to sing. They are noted for their singing schools and shape note singing. Further, they connect musical instruments in the Old Testament with &quot;many forms and customs, many types and shadows, many priests with priestly robes, many sacrifices, festivals, tithings&quot; that they see as having been abolished; &quot;had they been needed in the church Christ would have brought them over&quot;.

African-American Primitive Baptists may not share the general Primitive Baptist opposition to musical instruments, however.

===Family integrated worship===
Primitive Baptists reject the idea of Sunday School, viewing it as unscriptural and interfering with the right of parents to give religious instruction to their children. Instead, children sit with their parents and participate in the church service just like the rest of the congregation.

===Informal training of preachers===
Primitive Baptists consider theological seminaries to have &quot;no warrant or sanction from the New Testament, nor in the example of Christ and the apostles&quot;.

===Foot washing===
Most Primitive Baptists perform foot washing as a symbol of humility and service among the membership. The sexes are separated during the ritual where one person washes the feet of another. The practice is credited with increasing equality, as opposed to hierarchy, within Primitive Baptist churches.

<doc id="327320" wikidata="Q1546192" url="?curid=327320" title="Humber River (Ontario)">
<text>The Humber River (, ) is a river in Southern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Great Lakes Basin, is a tributary of Lake Ontario and is one of two major rivers on either side of the city of Toronto, the other being the Don River to the east. It was designated a Canadian Heritage River on September 24, 1999.

The Humber collects from about 750 creeks and tributaries in a fan-shaped area north of Toronto that encompasses portions of Dufferin County, the Regional Municipality of Peel, Simcoe County, and the Regional Municipality of York. The main branch runs for about from the Niagara Escarpment in the northwest, while another major branch, known as the East Humber River, starts at Lake St. George in the Oak Ridges Moraine near Aurora to the northeast. They join north of Toronto and then flow in a generally southeasterly direction into Lake Ontario at what was once the far western portions of the city. The river mouth is flanked by Sir Casimir Gzowski Park and Humber Bay Park East.

==Name==
There are two indigenous names attributed to the Humber. One is &quot;Cobechenonk&quot;, for &quot;leave the canoes and go back&quot;, attributed to the area&#x27;s most recent native inhabitants, the Anishinaabe. A second is “Niwa’ah Onega’gaih’ih,” “Little Thundering Waters.” A French map from 1688 called the river &quot;passage de taronto&quot;, while Popple&#x27;s map of 1733 shows the &quot;Tanaovate River&quot; beside the native settlement of Tejajagon. Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe named it the Humber River, likely after the Humber estuary in England.

==History==
The Humber has a long history of human settlement along its banks. Native settlement of the area is well documented archaeologically and occurred in three waves. The first settlers were the Palaeo-Indians who lived in the area from 10,000 to 7000 BC. The second wave, people of the Archaic period, settled the area between 7000 and 1000 BC and began to adopt seasonal migration patterns to take advantage of available plants, fish, and game. The third wave of native settlement was the Woodland period, which saw the introduction of the bow and arrow and the growing of crops which allowed for larger, more permanent villages. The Woodland period was also characterized by movement of native groups along what is known today as the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, running from Lake Ontario up the Humber to Lake Simcoe and eventually to the northern Great Lakes.

It is believed that Étienne Brûlé was the first European to encounter the Humber while travelling the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail. Brûlé passed through the watershed in 1615 on a mission from Samuel de Champlain to build alliances with native peoples, but left no written record. The Trail became a convenient shortcut to the upper Great Lakes for traders, explorers, and missionaries. A major landmark on the northern end of the trail in Lake Simcoe was used to describe the trail as a whole, and eventually the southern end became known simply as &quot;Toronto&quot; to the Europeans.

During the 1660s this was the site of Teiaiagon, a permanent settlement of the Seneca used for trading with the Europeans. Popple&#x27;s map of 1733 shows a prominent river beside &quot;Tejajagon&quot; which is assumed to be the Humber.

During late-17th and 18th century, the portage along this river was frequently used by the French traders as a short cut to the upper Great Lakes and the area north of Toronto.
In an attempt to secure the trade route from the British, the French established Magasin Royal, a trading post along the Humber River, near Baby Point. Completed in 1720, the trading post was abandoned shortly after the British fort in Oswego, New York was completed, as it diverted trade away from Magasin Royal.

In 1750, the French built another fort near the mouth of the Humber River, with the intention of diverting aboriginals using it as a passage from proceeding to the British in Fort Oswego. Known as Fort Toronto, the fort saw immediate success, with demand outstripping the supply of goods the Fort was able to provide. The success of the fort persuaded the Governor General of New France, the Marquis de la Jonquière to order the construction of a larger fort, with more trading capacity and military potential, in an effort to consolidate its hold of the region. Fort Rouillé, located in present-day Exhibition Place (east of the Humber River), was completed in the spring of 1751. The fort continued to operate until 1759, during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Instructed to evacuate and raze the fort should Fort Niagara be captured, the garrison would vacate the area for Montreal after they were defeated at Fort Niagara in July 1759.

The area was later secured by British forces in September 1760, when the British Army dispatched its chief scout and intelligence officer, Robert Rogers, along with 200 men and fifteen whale boats to take control of the former French fort. In 1772, Jean-Bonaventure Rousseau received a license to trade with the First Nations living within the vicinity of the mouth of the Humber River. His license was later inherited by his son, Jean Baptiste Rousseau, after his death in 1774. Rousseau maintained several contacts in the area, although did not permanently relocate there until 1792; when he established a trading post near the mouth of the Humber River.

Rousseau piloted John Graves Simcoe&#x27;s ship into Toronto Bay to officially commence the settlement of York in 1793. Most of the British attention was focused to the east of the Humber, around the protected Toronto Bay closer to the Don River. Settlement was scattered until after the War of 1812 when many loyalists moved to the area, who were joined by immigrants from Ireland and Scotland who chose to remain in British lands.

Upon his arrival in York, Simcoe was keenly aware of the need for a lumber mill and grist mill in the area. He had constructed a sawmill on the west bank of the river near present-day Bloor Street in 1793, which was operated by John Wilson. In 1797 Simcoe managed to get a grist mill established on the Humber River. It was owned and operated by John Lawrence. Over the years, numerous mills have been operated along the river by such men as William Cooper, W. P. Howland, Thomas Fisher, John Scarlett, William Gamble and Joseph Rowntree. The last grist mill on the Humber, Hayhoe Mills in Woodbridge, closed in 2007.

By 1860 the Humber Valley was extensively deforested. This decreased the stability of the river banks and increased damages done by periodic flooding. In 1878 a disastrous flood destroyed the remaining water-powered mills. As the Toronto area grew, the lands around the Humber became important farming areas; in addition, some areas of the river&#x27;s flood plain were developed as residential. This led to serious runoff problems in the 1940s, which the Humber Valley Conservation Authority was established to address. But in 1954, Hurricane Hazel raised the river to devastating flood levels, destroying buildings and bridges; on Raymore Drive, 60 homes were destroyed and 35 people were killed.

The Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA later TRCA) succeeded the Humber Valley authority in 1957 (the word &quot;Metropolitan&quot; was dropped in 1998). More recently, a task force within the Authority was formed to further clear the Humber as a part of the Great Lakes 2000 Cleanup Fund.

==Geography==
The Humber River begins at Humber Springs Ponds on the Niagara Escarpment in Mono, Dufferin County and reaches its mouth at Humber Bay on Lake Ontario in the city of Toronto. The West Humber River goes through the Claireville Conservation Area, joining the east branch at Summerlea Park.

===Watershed===
The Humber watershed is a hydrological feature of south-central Ontario, Canada, principally in north and west Toronto. It has an area of , flowing through numerous physio-graphic regions, including the Oak Ridges Moraine and the Niagara Escarpment. The watershed is bounded on the west by the Credit River, Etobicoke Creek and Mimico Creek watersheds, and on the east by the Garrison Creek, Don River and Rouge River watersheds, all six of which empty into Lake Ontario; on the north by the Nottawasaga River which empties into Lake Huron; and on the northeast by the Holland River, which empties into Lake Simcoe.

Unlike the Don to the east, the Humber remained relatively free from industrialization as Toronto grew. Since the flooding of Hurricane Hazel, it has been largely developed or redeveloped as parkland, with the extensive and important wetlands on its southern end remaining unmolested. Whereas the mouth of the Don is often clogged with flotsam and is obstructed by low bridges, the Humber is navigable and used for recreation and fishing.

Today the majority of the Toronto portion of the Humber is parkland, with paved trails running from the lake shore all the way to the northern border of the city some 30 km away. Trails following the various branches of the river form some 50 km of bicycling trails, much of which are in decent condition. Similar trails on the Don tend to be narrower and in somewhat worse condition, but the complete set of trails is connected along the lake shore, for some 100 km of off-road paved trails.

<text>King Ping of Zhou (; died 16 April 720 BC), personal name Ji Yijiu, was the thirteenth king of China&#x27;s Zhou dynasty and the first of the Eastern Zhou dynasty.

==History==
He was the son of King You of Zhou and Queen Shen (申后).

King You had exiled Queen Shen and Ji Yijiu after the king became enamoured with his concubine Bao Si and made her queen and his son Bofu his heir. As a result, Queen Shen’s father, the Marquess of Shen, teamed with the Quanrong nomads and local satellite states to overthrow King You. In the Battle of Mount Li King You and Bofu were killed, and Bao Si captured. Ji Yijiu ascended the throne. At about the same time, Jī Hàn (姬翰), Duke of Guó (虢公), elevated Jī Yúchén (姬余臣) to the throne as King Xie of Zhou (周携王), and the Zhou Dynasty saw a period of two parallel kings until King Xie was killed by Marquis Wen of Jin (晋文侯) in 750 BCE.

The Xinian manuscript, however, has challenged this traditional narrative. It seems to indicate that King Xie (also known as King Hui, or the King at Xie) was originally accepted by many of the regional lords over King Ping. After Marquis Wen of Jin killed Xie, there was not an officially accepted King of Zhou for 9 years, until, in 741 BCE, Marquis Wen recognized Ping. Three years later, in 738 BCE, Wen helped Ping move to Chengzhou.

King Ping moved the Western Zhou dynasty&#x27;s capital east from Haojing to Luoyang, thus ending the Western Zhou and beginning the Eastern Zhou dynasty and the Spring and Autumn period. He is the first Zhou king to be mentioned in the chronological account of the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;.

Over 14 centuries after King Ping’s death, Tang dynasty Empress regnant Wu Zetian claimed ancestry from King Ping through his son Prince Wu, and changed the dynastic name to Zhou, which was reverted to Tang after her death.

<text>Kawainui Fishpond or Kawainui Marsh is a wetland and resurfacing fishpond in Kailua, Hawaiʻi. It is the largest remaining wetland and the largest ancient freshwater fishpond in Hawaiʻi, and a designated Ramsar Convention wetland.

== Prehistory and Polynesian arrival ==
Geologic evidence such as core samples containing coral suggest that Kawainui was a wide, shallow bay in prehistory. Its water content peaked BCE, at which point a barrier reef likely grew between the bay and the Pacific Ocean, but did not fully separate the two. Erosion from waves can be seen in certain areas at the edges of the marsh as it exists today, near Nā Pōhaku o Hauwahine.

By about 500 CE, sea level had lowered to roughly the current level, exposing much of the barrier reef. The reef blocked much of the flow of water between the bay and the ocean, causing the bay to become shallower and brackish. Kawainui had effectively become a lagoon, connected to nearby Kaʻelepulu Pond by natural channels. Polynesians arrived in the area around this time, likely settling around the edges of the lagoon near springs. The surrounding area, which had previously been forested, was cleared over a period of several centuries for agricultural purposes. Kawainui was one of the first areas in the Hawaiian Islands to be settled by the group of Polynesian mariners that would become the native Hawaiians.

== History ==

=== Before European contact ===
By 1750, Kawainui had been developed by the native Hawaiians into a fishpond used for food. Common fish included mullet, awa, and oʻopu. Irrigated loʻi kalo around the edges of the fishpond, as well as nearby patches of dryland kalo, banana, sugarcane, and sweet potato, served as an additional food source. There were also at least three significant heiau built around the fishpond, including Ulupō. Some evidence suggests that the Hawaiians also improved the channel connecting Kawainui to Kaʻelepulu.

=== After European contact ===
In 1778, James Cook arrived in Hawaii, marking the first contact between Hawaiians and Europeans. European arrivals carried diseases, including measles, smallpox, and influenza, to which the native Hawaiians had no prior exposure and no immunity; the total population of Hawaiians dropped from roughly 300,000 to 50,000 within 50 years. This made large-scale work such as maintenance of fishponds impossible, causing Kawainui Fishpond and the surrounding agricultural area to become unused and overgrown.

In 1848, the Great Māhele and the growing economic importance of Honolulu drove much of the native Hawaiian population away from Kawainui and the surrounding area. The concept of private land ownership was completely unknown to most Hawaiians, who therefore did not file claims for the land they were entitled to. The vast majority of property in and near Kawainui therefore went to aliʻi, especially Kalama. Crops including ʻawa, wauke, and sweet potatoes continued to be grown in the area at this time. Cultivatable areas of the valley floor around the fishpond, which were gradually becoming a marsh, were used as a site for loʻi kalo.

After Kalama died in 1870, her land was sold to American lawyer Charles Coffin Harris, including Kawainui Fishpond which was still intact at the time. Beginning in 1878, water that would have flowed into Kawainui from Maunawili was instead diverted to Waimānalo for irrigation of sugarcane. After Harrisʻ death in 1881, his daughter and heir Nannie Roberta Harris owned the ahupuaʻa of Kailua until 1917.

=== In the 1900s ===
While under Harris family ownership, Kawainui was used for rice cultivation by Chinese farmers; the vast majority of the fishpond was being used for this purpose by 1900, but it was still publicly known as a fishpond. In 1917, Nannie Harris sold her land to Harold Kainalu Long Castle. In the early 1920s, water from Kawainui was drained and used for sugarcane in Waimānalo. Rice cultivation began to decline, and most of the former rice paddies were used for ranching by Harold Castle, who introduced large numbers of invasive plants in order to feed his cattle.

During World War II, Kawainui was used as a training area by the United States Armed Forces, which leased it from Kaneohe Ranch.

In the 1950s, the Honolulu Construction and Dredging Company ran a rock crusher along one end of the marsh. The City and County of Honolulu subsequently leased that area and used it as a site to burn trash until 1962.

In 1956, Kaneohe Ranch pumped water out of Kawainui until the water table dropped by almost four feet, making the area more usable for grazing as part of a land reclamation process that was discontinued in 1965.

The Hawaii State Board of Geographic Names officially designated Kawainui a marsh in 1982. In the early 1900s, it had been inaccurately described as a swamp.

=== In the 2000s ===
In February 2005, Kawainui was designated a Ramsar Wetland with site number 1460.

As of 2019, a mass of peat about four feet thick was covering much of Kawainui. Trees were beginning to grow in it, and papyrus had been seen growing as well. Multiple nonprofit organizations are working to restore areas of the fishpond through traditional practices.

== Wildlife ==
Kawainui is a habitat for native Hawaiian water birds including the four endangered bird species ae’o, ʻalae ʻula, ʻalae kea, and koloa, for which the United States Fish and Wildlife Service identified it as a &quot;primary habitat&quot;. It is also used by migratory birds. The State of Hawaii has designated most of Kawainui marsh as a state wildlife refuge.

== In Hawaiian culture ==
Hawaiian legends describe &quot;lepo-ʻai-ʻia&quot;, or &quot;edible mud&quot;, that was present in Kawainui. The traditional story states that Kauluakalana brought the mud from a foreign place and put it in Kawainui Fishpond, and that it was eaten by the servants and warriors of Kamehameha I during his invasion of Oʻahu in 1795.

Kawainui was additionally believed to have a guardian spirit in the form of a moʻo named Hauwahine, who ensured that there was enough food available for the people, but removed the fish from the pond if the people living in the area were oppressed by the aliʻi. Pollution and overgrowth were thought to be insults to Hauwahine, which was one motivation for the Hawaiians to keep the fishpond clean.

<text>The Hash House Harriers (HHH or H3) is an international group of non-competitive running social clubs. An event organized by a club is known as a Hash or Run, or a Hash Run. A common denominal verb for this activity is Hashing, with participants calling themselves Hashers. Male members are referred to as Harriers and females are known as Harriettes.

The Hash is humorously known as &quot;A Drinking Club With A Running Problem,&quot; with the preferred beverage of consumption being beer.

==History==
Hashing originated in December 1938 in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, then in the Federated Malay States (now Malaysia). A group of British immigrants began meeting on Friday evenings, to run in a fashion patterned after the traditional British game of hare and hounds, in which one or two &quot;hare&quot; runners scatter a trail of cut paper for the &quot;hounds&quot; to track. Apart from the excitement of chasing the hare and finding the trail, Harriers reaching the end of the trail would partake of beer, ginger beer, and cigarettes. With hash names in parentheses, the original members included Albert Stephen Ignatius Gispert (&quot;G&quot;), Cecil Lee, Frederick Thomson (&quot;Horse&quot;), Ronald Bennett (&quot;Torch&quot;), Eric Galvin, H.M. Doig, and John Woodrow.

A. S. Gispert suggested the name &quot;Hash House Harriers&quot; after the Selangor Club Annex, known as the &quot;Hash House&quot;, where several of the original hashers lived and dined. The &quot;Hash House&quot; got its name for &quot;its hodgepodge of edible servings being passed off for food&quot;. The term hash was used as an old British slang for &quot;bad food&quot;.

Hashing ceased after the Invasion of Malaya during World War II, but several of the original group restarted it in 1946, after the war, and switched to meeting on Monday evenings. A.S.I. Gispert had been killed on 11 February 1942, in the Japanese invasion of Singapore, an event commemorated by many chapters with an annual Gispert Memorial Run.

While attempting to reorganise in the city of Kuala Lumpur after World War II, hashers were informed by the Registrar of Societies that, since they were a &quot;group&quot;, they would require a constitution. The objectives of the Hash House Harriers as recorded on the club registration card dated 1950 are:

* To promote physical fitness among our members
* To get rid of weekend hangovers
* To acquire a good thirst and to satisfy it in beer
* To persuade the older members that they are not as old as they feel

In 1962, Ian Cumming founded the second chapter in Singapore. Chapters are commonly called &quot;Kennels&quot;, following in tradition to similar Hound &amp; Hare clubs. The idea spread through the Far East and the South Pacific, Europe, and North America, expanding rapidly during the mid-1970s.

There are almost 1500 chapters in all parts of the world, with members distributing newsletters, directories and magazines, and organising regional and world hashing events. As of 2003, there were even two organised chapters operating in Antarctica.

==Events==
=== Regular meetings ===
Most hashing clubs gather on a weekly or monthly basis. However, some events occur sporadically, e.g., February 29th, Friday the 13th, Typhoon &#x27;T8&#x27; or a full moon.

At a hash, one or more members (&quot;hares&quot;) lay a trail, which is then followed by the remainder of the group (the &quot;pack&quot; or &quot;hounds&quot;). Paper, flour, or chalk are usually used to mark the trail. The trail periodically ends at a &quot;check&quot;. The pack must find where it begins again; often, the trail includes false trails, short cuts, dead ends, check backs, and splits. These features are designed to keep the pack together despite differences in fitness level or running speed, as front-runners are forced to slow down to find the &quot;true&quot; trail, allowing stragglers to catch up.

Members sometimes describe their group as &quot;a drinking club with a running problem&quot;, indicating that the social element of an event is as important, if not more so than any athleticism involved. Beer remains an integral part of a hash. However, the balance between running and drinking differs between chapters, with some groups placing more focus on socializing and others on running.

Generally, hash events are open to the public and require no reservation or membership, but most require a small fee, referred to as &quot;hash cash&quot;, to cover the costs incurred, such as food or drink, and the club treasurer may also be nicknamed &quot;Hash Cash&quot;.

Some hash clubs have a hash home, which could be a bar, restaurant, resort, or a sports club. In that case, the hash always or almost always starts at the hash home. The club may then transport the hashers to some other location to start the run. Other clubs simply post the start on the internet, and the hashers make their own way to that location. The run will then start and finish at that location.

Many hash clubs are in college or university towns, in which case the hashers are probably young, and most will run the trails. Other clubs might be in areas with an older population, so they will probably walk the trails. In the United States, hash clubs tend to have a large number of armed forces veterans. Some hash clubs meet at night, which means that the runners might need a flashlight to find the marks. Some hash clubs are men only, some women only, but most are mixed. Some are very adult-oriented, which means bawdy drinking songs, etc. Others are family-oriented. There are many informal groups attached to various hash chapters. For example, the regular hash meets every Saturday, but there may be an informal group that meets on, say, Wednesday to research trails.

=== Socializing ===
The end of a trail is an opportunity to socialize, have a drink, and observe any traditions of the individual chapter (see Traditions). When the hash officially ends, many members may continue socializing at an &quot;on-after,&quot; &quot;on-down,&quot; &quot;on-on-on,&quot; &quot;apres,&quot; or &quot;hash bash,&quot; an event held at a nearby house, pub, or restaurant.

===Special events===
In addition to regularly scheduled hashes, a club or chapter may also organize other events or themed runs. Many also hold special events on their anniversaries or when they reach a milestone in the number of runs, e.g. for run number 100, 200, 777, 1000, etc. This may include a special weekend with several runs and evening celebrations

=== Red dress runs ===
An event held annually by some chapters is the &quot;Red Dress Run&quot;. In 1987, Donna Rhinehart was taken to a hash in Long Beach, California, to be introduced to the sport. She was invited to &quot;wait in the truck&quot; until her host returned. Instead Rhinehart joined the hash in her red dress. The following year, the San Diego Hash House Harriers sent Rhinehart an airline ticket to attend the inaugural &quot;Red Dress Run&quot;. Hundreds of hashers wore red dresses for the event which was widely covered by local media. In addressing the crowd, Rhinehart, or &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; as she became known, suggested that such hashes might be held to raise funds for local charities. The event quickly spread around the globe to places such as Beijing, Montreal, Helsinki, Osan/Yangsan Hashers, Moscow, Tokyo, New Orleans, Washington DC and Hobart in Australia. Over the years, it has raised millions of dollars for charity. The New Orleans Hash House Harriers attracted 7,000 participants to their Red Dress Run in 2010, raising more than $200,000 for 50 local charities.

Today the Red Dress Run is another part of the Hash House Harriers&#x27; heritage. Rhinehart died in 2013 as the Hash House Harriers were celebrating the 25th anniversary of their Red Dress Run.

===Variations===
* Hash House Bikers (Bike hashes or bashes) follow normal hashing traditions with the hare and pack riding bicycles. The two oldest bike hash chapters or kennels are Singapore Bike Hash (July 1989) and Bike-O-Psycho in Orlando, Florida (July 1991).
* River hashes or snorkel hashes (rashes, splashes, or snatches) follow normal hashing traditions, but take place in an aquatic environment with participants using snorkels, fins, kayaks, floats, and other rafts. First documented underwater/scuba Hash trail was in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt by Cairo H3 in 1990.
* Snowshoe hashes are much like normal trails, but the hare and hounds are in the snow, on snowshoes. Marking trails with white flour or with colored chalk is impractical on snow, so flour can be colored using carpenter&#x27;s chalk (most common practice) or jello mix (which will be more vibrant when it gets wet from the snow). This practice is commonly used on all winter hash trails in snowy regions, not just snowshoe hashing. Squirts of colored water may be attempted but it has a tendency to be further diluted by the snow and also melts the snow and thus travels below the surface becoming less visible than colored flour. 
* SKASH is a Ski Hash, accomplished on skis. 
* Hash-a-thon, tour-duh-hash, Hash challenge and tri-hash-thon are special &quot;competitive&quot; events. Hash-a-thons involve multiple trails (normally 4) in 24-hour period totaling up to 26.2 miles (a marathon). Tour-duh-Hash is 7 days of hashing. Hash challenge is a team event (3–4 hashers) who complete a 42 km hash through the Malaysian jungle. Tri-hash-thon is an event consisting of 3 trails: 1 running, 1 swimming/snorkeling/river float, and 1 biking (bash).
* Family hashes welcome children (sometimes called hash house horrors or ankle biters) with soft drinks replacing alcoholic beverages and drinking songs toned down appropriately.
* Pick up hashes – Hashes that follow traditional hashing guidelines minus the pre-selection of a hare. At a pick up hash, the hare is decided randomly at the beginning of the event.
* Disaster Hash – A disaster hash is basically an impromptu hash that can be called by any hash member whenever a disaster occurs. The disaster can be anywhere in the world and can range from an earthquake to a flat tire. The disaster hash differs by two major hash components, the hares and hash names. The hare is chosen on the spot, given flour, a destination, and a one-minute head start. Whoever catches the hare, becomes the hare. They take the flour and continue along to the destination, this repeats as many times as the hare is caught. Secondly, disaster hashers are given special disaster hash names. All virgins get named at a disaster hash, usually having to do with the disaster in question and the disaster hash name is completely separate to a normal hash.

==Trails==
Hashing has not strayed far from its roots in Kuala Lumpur (and before that as games &#x27;Hare and Hounds&#x27; and &#x27;paper chase&#x27;). The hares mark their trail with paper, chalk, sawdust, strings or coloured flour, depending on the environment and weather.

One of the functions of special marks like checks, false trails, check backs, hooks, etc. (see below), is to keep the &#x27;pack&#x27; (the &#x27;hounds&#x27; or runners) together as faster runners will usually be the first to find them and so go down false trails, check backs, or be sent to the back by hooks while the slower runners and walkers will have time to catch up with them.

Special marks may be used to indicate a false trail, a backtrack, a shortcut, or a turn. The most commonly used mark is a &quot;check&quot;, indicating that hashers will have to search in any direction to find the continuation of the trail. Trails may contain a &quot;beer check&quot;, where the pack stops to consume beer, water, or snacks, allowing any stragglers to catch up to the group.

Trails may pass through any sort of terrain and hashers may run through back alleyways, residential areas, city streets, forests, swamps, deep mud (&quot;shiggy&quot;) or shopping malls and may climb fences, ford streams, explore storm drains or scale cliffs in their pursuit of the hare.

===Signals and terms===
Hashers often carry horns or whistles to communicate with each other, in addition to verbal communication. Every hash house employs its own set of trail marks, and the names for these marks may vary widely, so newcomers or visitors will have the local markings explained to them before the run at a &quot;chalk talk.&quot; The most common term is &quot;on-on,&quot; shouted by runners to let others know they are on the right trail. A yell of &quot;R-U?&quot; (pronounced &quot;are you&quot;) is a question to other hashers if they are on trail – it should be responded with either &quot;On-On&quot; or &quot;Looking or Checking.&quot;

Sometimes there is a call to &quot;circle up&quot; – this is a call from a leader for the hashers to form a circle, be quiet, and pay attention. Circles are called for the &quot;chalk talk&quot; to give news, or for some ceremony such as to thank the hare for the hash.

===Trail markings===

Each hare should explain their markings at the start of the trail, as some marks like X or O may have completely different meanings depending on the local custom and can sometimes even vary from hare to hare within the same kennel.

Many clubs around the world still use shredded or small squares of paper, but due to litter laws and other environmental concerns, most clubs have transitioned to chalk or flour, but other substances may be used too, e.g. saw dust, colored powder, or pieces of toilet paper.


===Trail types===
There are two types of trails. &quot;Live trails&quot; are laid by hares who are given a head start, while &quot;dead trails&quot; are pre-laid hours or days before the hash begins. Live trails and dead trails are also known as &quot;live hare&quot; and &quot;dead hare&quot; trails, respectively. Live trails are closer to the original &quot;hare and hound&quot; tradition, with the intent of the pack being to catch the hare rather than making it to the end, and are more common in the United States, while the rest of the world tends toward dead trails.

A trail may be &quot;A to A,&quot; where the trail returns to the start, or &quot;A to B,&quot; where the beginning and end of the trail are widely separated. Some trails are referred to as &quot;A to A′ (prime),&quot; denoting an ending point that is close to (usually short walking distance), but not the same as the start. There is also &quot;B to A,&quot; in which the participants are ferried to another location for the run back to the gathering point.

The hash trail depends on the environment of the hash chapter. If there are hills or mountains nearby, that is always the preferred location. Many trails run through rural areas, such as forests, farm areas, jungle, along with or through rivers, etc. In densely populated areas, the hash will often start and finish in a public park, and the trails will run on city streets.

==Traditions==

===Circles===
Most hash events end with a group gathering known as &quot;circle,&quot; or less commonly as &quot;religion.&quot; Led by chapter leadership, the circle provides a time to socialize, sing drinking songs, recognize individuals, formally name members, or inform the group of pertinent news or upcoming events. Circles may be led by the chapter grandmaster (GM), the group&#x27;s religious advisor (RA), or by a committee. Impromptu input is welcome and solicited.

===Down-downs===
A &quot;down-down&quot; is a means of punishing, rewarding, or merely recognizing an individual for any action or behavior according to the customs or whims of the group. Generally, the individual in question is asked to consume without pause the contents of his or her drinking vessel or risk pouring the remaining contents on his or her head. Individuals may be recognized for outstanding service or their status as a visitor or newcomer. Down-downs also serve as punishment for misdemeanors real, imagined, or blatantly made up. Such transgressions may include: failing to stop at the beer check, pointing with a finger, pronouncing the letter &quot;r,&quot; or using real names. Commonly, hashers who wear new shoes to an event can be required to drink from that shoe.

Many chapters include an ice seat or throne as part of the down-down ceremony. Those who are to consume a down-down sit on a large block of ice while they await the completion of the down-down song. If the offense that resulted in the down-down is particularly egregious, the hasher may be subjected to a long song with many verses.

===Hash names===
In most chapters, the use of real names during an event is discouraged. Members are typically given a &quot;hash name,&quot; usually in deference to a particularly notorious escapade, a personality trait, or their physical appearance. In some chapters, the name must be earned – that is, Hashers are not named until they have done something outstanding, unusual, or stupid enough to warrant one. In other chapters, the process is more mechanical, and Hashers are named after completing a certain number of events (5–10 being the most common) or setting their first run (sometimes referred to as a Virgin Hare).

Naming conventions differ from Kennel to Kennel, with some focusing on &quot;family-friendly&quot; names (for example: Lost My Way), innuendo (for example, Purple Vein), and some go out of their way to make the name as bawdy, offensive, or politically incorrect as possible. But in general, once named, Hashers will refer to you by that name at the Hash irrespective of the Hash itself. For the more offensive names, it might be censored in comical ways to comply with the family-friendly tone of other Kennels, but typically it is kept as-is.

Hashers who have not been named are generally referred to as &quot;Just (Name),&quot; &quot;No Name (Name)&quot; (e.g., &quot;No Name John&quot;), or simply &quot;Virgin.&quot;

Naming traditions are also differ based on Kennels. In some, the Grand Master (GM) has the responsibility, while others have the Religious Advisor (RA) do the ceremony. Others still allow the Hares themselves to name the Hasher. In some, the Circle gets to help and shout out suggestions. However, as a general rule, Hashers are not permitted to give themselves a Hash Name due to the obvious conflict of interest. Hashers who do so are often renamed by the chapter at the earliest opportunity and with a more offensive name. Hashers who do get named and do not like their name may be renamed by their Kennel or by another Kennel. Usually, this backfires as Hashers typically strive to give the complaining Hasher an even more offensive or further inappropriate name. Similarly, new Hashers who pursue a desire for an obviously offensive or inappropriate name may intentionally be given a weaker name, such as &quot;Freckles,&quot; &quot;Frog Butt,&quot; or &quot;Mr. Poo Poo.&quot;

===Symbols &amp; Logos===
Many Hashes have their own logo for their own Kennel. There are even custom logos made for special events like the [Interhash]. However, due to the running theme, there are many common symbols universally attributed to the Hash that can be seen across multiple items. One such traditional symbol is the outline of a human foot (or a pair), often including the phrase &quot;On-On.&quot;

Hash T-shirts are among the most common things to find at a Hash, and some consider them collection material. Unique Hashes and special events usually have a Hash T-shirt that comes from recognizing participation, and carry the symbols of various Kennels, dates, Hares of the run, event locations, sponsors, and more. A large sample is available in the Digital Hash T-shirt Museum

===Clothing===
Hashers occasionally wear specialized clothing on trail or to the closing circles. Common items include thick, knee-high socks (commonly referred to as &quot;Shiggy&quot; socks), kilts, or &quot;happi&quot; coats, while some chapters (aka &quot;kennels&quot; in hare-and-hound chapters) offer &quot;earned&quot; clothing such as bibs or sashes. Shiggy socks are worn to protect the shins and knees of the wearer from thorns, mud, branches, or whatever else they run through. The Hash has its own tartan for members&#x27; kilts. Custom happi coats, originating out of Japan, are also commonly seen and made to reflect the local kennel.

===Hash Hymn===
&quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; is the Hash Hymn. All Hashers recognize the Hash Hymn, and it usually commands as much respect as possible. While humorous additions or renditions to the song itself exist, it is one of the few things that remain consistent throughout the Hashing world. There is some dispute to the song&#x27;s origin; however, its persistence in the Hashing world would suggest it originated from Mother H3 itself which is Royal Selangor Club (RSC), in Malaysia.

==International events==
There are several international events, where hashers from different groups get together to run and socialize. Still, the most famous is the biennial &quot;Interhash&quot;, where hashers from around the world gather.
The 2006 &quot;Interhash—Chiang Mai&quot; offered supporting runs in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and southwest China. The 2018 event was scheduled for the weekend of 27 May on the Fiji Islands.

<doc id="327337" wikidata="Q6606031" url="?curid=327337" title="List of ants of Great Britain">
<text>This is a list of ants of Great Britain, including endemic and introduced species. Compared with much of the rest of Europe, Great Britain has a smaller number of ants. The size and diversity of ant species in any area is largely determined by the highest summer soil temperature, and this being so, it is not surprising that the greatest concentration of different species is centred in the warmer parts of the country – Dorset, Hampshire, Surrey, the Isle of Wight and Kent being the 5 richest counties, with 33, 31, 29, 27 and 26 different species present respectively.

A few species, best exemplified by &quot;Lasius niger&quot; and &quot;Myrmica rubra&quot;, are truly cosmopolitan, colonising a great variety of different habitats (often including those directly resultant from human activities). These species are very common in most places, and have ranges that cover most of the nation.

The larger part of Great Britain&#x27;s ant species are, however, considerably more specialised in their requirements. Most independent species are found on undisturbed heathland in the south – probably as a direct result of its superior summer soil temperatures – and six are entirely dependent on other species during their mature life (i.e. not simply to found colonies, a requirement of many further species).

Many of the lesser seen species are at the northern extent of their range in Britain, and for this reason are confined to the south.
The variously differing biotopes afforded by parkland / partially wooded heath and larger traditional style gardens are also inhabited by a number of otherwise more heathland-pigeonholed species, such as &quot;Formica fusca/lemani&quot;, &quot;Lasius mixtus/umbratus&quot; and &quot;L. fuliginosus&quot;.

The remaining species are mostly . These include the well known wood ants, typified by the southerly inclined &quot;Formica rufa&quot;, and the more northerly &quot;F. lugubris&quot; and &quot;F. aquilonia&quot;. These large, noticeable species abide in mounds constructed from leaf litter, which are still a common sight in many older forests and broken woodland up and down the country. A few other smaller, less easily spotted species also make their livings in conjunction with more wooded areas. &quot;Stenamma&quot; species, &quot;Leptothorax acervorum and Temnothorax nylanderi&quot; can be found, locality permitting, under stones/logs and beneath loose bark respectively, in established woods. The former habitat is also shared by the rather locally distributed &quot;Ponera coarctata&quot;, one of two unambiguously native British representatives of the subfamily Ponerinae. The other is the recently discovered &quot;P. testacea&quot;, which inhabits sites.

The list largely follows Skinner &amp; Allen&#x27;s &quot;Naturalists&#x27; Handbooks 24 : Ants&quot; published in 1996, though there have been some additions and corrections. Introduced species are marked with an asterisk (*).

<text>Samuel Elmo Martin (29 January 1924 – 28 November 2009) was an American linguist known for seminal work on the languages of East Asia, a professor at Yale University, and the author of many works on the Korean and Japanese languages.

==Biography==
Martin was born in Pittsburg, Kansas on 29 January 1924, and grew up in Emporia, Kansas. During World War II he was trained as a Japanese Language Officer, and was stationed in Japan at the end of the war.

After the war, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in Oriental Languages. He graduated in 1947, but stayed on at Berkeley to study for a master&#x27;s degree in linguistics under Chao Yuen Ren, which he completed in 1949. He then went to Yale University to study for a PhD in Japanese Linguistics under Bernard Bloch. He completed his dissertation on Japanese morphophonemics in 1950 (published as a monograph by the Linguistic Society of America the following year), and was immediately offered a position at Yale University, where he remained until his retirement in 1994. He was made professor of Far Eastern Linguistics in 1962, and chaired both the Department of East and South Asian Languages and the Department of Linguistics. He also served as director of undergraduate studies in linguistics and director of graduate studies in East Asian languages and literatures. He was an executive fellow of Timothy Dwight College.

After Martin retired from Yale University, he moved to near Vancouver, Washington, near where his wife Nancy Rendell Martin had grown up, and close to Portland, Oregon, where his daughter Norah Martin teaches philosophy. During his retirement, Martin continued research on a variety of linguistic topics, notably Middle Korean.

In 1994, Martin was awarded the Korean government&#x27;s Presidential Medal of Honor for Distinguished Cultural Contributions.

==Scholarly contributions==
In the 1950s Martin worked on issues relating to Japanese and Korean orthography and romanizations. At this time he coined the term &quot;Sino-Xenic&quot; in creating a common nomenclature for Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary, Sino-Korean vocabulary and Sino-Japanese vocabulary. He published a monograph on Japanese orthography in 1952, and in 1954 he was invited by Syngman Rhee, President of South Korea, to give his ideas on the orthographic reform of the Korean script, which were published in 1954 in various Korean newspapers. In 1954 he devised the Yale romanization system for transliterating Korean, which is extensively used by linguists. During this period he also made important contributions on Chinese, producing a monograph on the phonemes of Ancient Chinese in 1953, and an important article on Mandarin phonology in 1957.

During the 1960s Martin extended his linguistic talents to studies of the Dagur language (1961), and the Shodon dialect of Ryukyuan (1970). His most famous work from this period was a 1966 article, &quot;Lexical evidence relating Korean to Japanese&quot;, that was based on a systematic application of the comparative method, and which advanced the hypothesis that Korean and Japanese are genetically related. He also published articles on subjects that had been very little studied until that time, such as sound symbolism in Korean (1962) and speech styles in Japan and Korea (1964).

His monumental work, &quot;Reference Grammar of Japanese&quot;, was published in 1975, and together with his &quot;Japanese Language through Time&quot; (1987) are landmarks in the study of the grammar and history of the Japanese language.

During the 1980s Martin concentrated his research activities on Middle Korean, making detailed analysis of numerous 15th and 16th century Korean texts, which he used as the basis for a database of Middle Korean linguistic structures and examples. This work formed the backbone of his monumental &quot;Reference Grammar of Korean&quot; (1993) which provides a detailed description of both 20th-century Korean and Middle Korean morphemes, making it a valuable tool for those researching the history and structure of the Korean language.

In addition to his scholarly linguistic works, Martin was interested in the teaching of East Asian languages, and he wrote a number of elementary texts and dictionaries for beginners. According to a Merriam-Webster blog called &quot;Words We&#x27;re Watching&quot;, Martin is &quot;widely credited&quot; with coining the term &quot;&quot; as a gender-neutral term for a nephew or niece, by analogy with the word &quot;sibling&quot; (though Merriam-Webster&#x27;s lexicographers had been unable to verify this directly).

<text>Oregon Country was a large region of the Pacific Northwest of North America that was subject to a long dispute between the United Kingdom and the United States in the early 19th century. The area, which had been demarcated by the Treaty of 1818, consisted of the land north of 42° N latitude, south of 54°40′ N latitude, and west of the Rocky Mountains down to the Pacific Ocean and east to the Continental Divide. Article III of the 1818 treaty gave joint control to both nations for ten years, allowed land to be claimed, and guaranteed free navigation to all mercantile trade. However, both countries disputed the terms of the international treaty. Oregon Country was the American name, while the British used Columbia District for the region. 

British and French Canadian fur traders had entered Oregon Country prior to 1810 before the arrival of American settlers from the mid-1830s onwards, which led to the foundation of the Provisional Government of Oregon. Its coastal areas north of the Columbia River were frequented by ships from all nations engaged in the maritime fur trade, with many vessels between the 1790s and 1810s coming from Boston. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, whose Columbia Department comprised most of the Oregon Country and north into New Caledonia and beyond 54°40′ N, with operations reaching tributaries of the Yukon River, managed and represented British interests in the region.

After the dispute became an election issue in the 1844 U.S. presidential election, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to settle the problem with the Oregon Treaty in 1846. It established the British-American boundary at the 49th parallel (except Vancouver Island). With the end of joint occupancy, the region south of the 49th parallel became Oregon Territory in the United States while the northern portion became part of the British colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island. The area that made up Oregon Country now lies within the present-day borders of the Canadian province of British Columbia and the entirety of the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Montana and Wyoming.

Throughout this period, the Oregon Country was inhabited by numerous independent American Indian peoples, who received no recognition by the British or American governments in the eventual disposition of the territory. Indian traders nevertheless played a critical role in the ongoing fur trade that still formed the Oregon Country&#x27;s primary economic activity until mid-century, and the language of the Chinook nation of the lower Columbia river (Chinook jargon) formed the &quot;lingua franca&quot; between Indians and the small European population during and after the 1818-46 period. This was the last period in which the Oregon Country&#x27;s Indian nations retained a sizeable majority in their land, prior to the rapid and devastating arrival of European diseases in the 1860s, and were able to maintain relative economic independence thanks to the necessity of their hunting skills in the fur trade. The eventual partition of the Oregon Country into national domains by the two colonial powers, increasing settlement, and the drastic decline of the fur trade due to diminishing supply all contributed to catastrophic decline in Indian population after 1846, and the arbitrary seizure of their land over the following two decades in the interests of newly arrived settlers.

==Toponym==
The earliest evidence of the name &quot;Oregon&quot; has Spanish origins. The term comes from the historical chronicle (1598) which was written by the New Spaniard Rodrigo Motezuma and which made reference to the Columbia River when the Spanish explorers penetrated into the North American territory that became part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This chronicle is the first topographical and linguistic source with respect to the place name &quot;Oregon&quot;. There are also two other sources with Spanish origins, such as the name &quot;Oregano&quot;, which grows in the southern part of the region. It is most probable that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, as there are some populations in Spain such as , which is in the province of Ciudad Real, also considering that the individualization in Spanish language with the mutation of the letter &quot;g&quot; instead of &quot;j&quot;.

Another theory is that French Canadian fur company employees called the Columbia River &quot;hurricane river&quot; , because of the strong winds of the Columbia Gorge. George R. Stewart argues in a 1944 article in &quot;American Speech&quot; that the name came from an engraver&#x27;s error in a French map published in the early 18th century, on which the (Wisconsin River) was spelled , broken on two lines with the below, so that there appeared to be a river flowing to the west named . This theory was endorsed in &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot; as &quot;the most plausible explanation&quot;.

==Early exploration==
George Vancouver explored Puget Sound in 1792. Vancouver claimed it for Great Britain on June 4, 1792, naming it for one of his officers, Lieutenant Peter Puget. Alexander Mackenzie was the first European to cross North America by land north of New Spain, arriving at Bella Coola on what is now the central coast of British Columbia in 1793. From 1805 to 1806, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark explored the territory of the United States on the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

David Thompson, working for the Montreal-based North West Company, explored much of the region beginning in 1807 with his friend and colleague Simon Fraser, following the Fraser River to its mouth in 1808, attempting to ascertain whether it was the Columbia, as had been theorized about its northern reaches through New Caledonia, where it was known by its Dakleh name as the &quot;Tacoutche Tesse&quot;. Thompson was the first European to voyage down the entire length of the Columbia River. Along the way, his party camped at the junction with the Snake River on July 9, 1811. He erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for the United Kingdom and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post on the site. Later in 1811, on the same expedition, he finished his survey of the entire Columbia, arriving at a partially constructed Fort Astoria two months after the departure of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s ill-fated &quot;Tonquin&quot;.

==Territorial evolution==
The Oregon Country was originally claimed by Great Britain, France, Russia, and Spain; the Spanish claim was later taken up by the United States. The extent of the region being claimed was vague at first, evolving over decades into the specific borders specified in the U.S.-British treaty of 1818. The United States based its claim in part on Robert Gray&#x27;s entry of the Columbia River in 1792 and the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Great Britain based its claim in part on British overland explorations of the Columbia River by David Thompson and on prior discovery and exploration along the coast. Spain&#x27;s claim was based on the Inter caetera and Treaty of Tordesillas of 1493–94, as well as explorations of the Pacific coast in the late 18th century. Russia based its claim on its explorations and trading activities in the region. It asserted its ownership of the region north of the 51st parallel by the Ukase of 1821, which was quickly challenged by the other powers and withdrawn to 54°40′N by separate treaties with the U.S. and Britain in 1824 and 1825, respectively.

Spain gave up its claims of exclusivity via the Nootka Conventions of the 1790s. In the Nootka Conventions, which followed the Nootka Crisis, Spain granted Britain rights to the Pacific Northwest. However, it did not establish a northern boundary for Spanish California, nor did it extinguish Spanish rights to the Pacific Northwest. Spain later relinquished any remaining claims to territory north of the 42nd parallel to the United States as part of the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819. In the 1820s, Russia gave up its claims south of 54°40′ and east of the 141st meridian in separate treaties with the United States and Britain.

Meanwhile, the United States and Britain negotiated the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which extended the boundary between their territories west along the 49th parallel to the Rocky Mountains. The two countries agreed to &quot;joint occupancy&quot; of the land west of the Rockies to the Pacific Ocean.

In 1843, settlers established their government, called the Provisional Government of Oregon. A legislative committee drafted a code of laws known as the Organic Law. It included the creation of an executive committee of three, a judiciary, a militia, land laws, and four counties. There was vagueness and confusion over the nature of the 1843 Organic Law, in particular, whether it was constitutional or statutory. In 1844, a new legislative committee decided to consider it statutory. The 1845 Organic Law made additional changes, including allowing the participation of British subjects in the government. Although the Oregon Treaty of 1846 settled the boundaries of U.S. jurisdiction, the provisional government continued to function until 1849, when the first governor of Oregon Territory arrived. A faction of Oregon politicians hoped to continue Oregon&#x27;s political evolution into an independent nation, but the pressure to join the United States prevailed by 1848, four months after the Mexican–American War.

==Early settlement==

In 1805, the American Lewis and Clark Expedition marked the first official American exploration of the area, creating the first temporary settlement of Euro-Americans in the area near the mouth of the Columbia River at Fort Clatsop. Two years later, in 1807, David Thompson of the Montreal-based North West Company penetrated the Oregon Country from the north via Athabasca Pass, near the headwaters of the Columbia River. From there he navigated nearly the full length of the river through to the Pacific Ocean.

In 1810, John Jacob Astor commissioned and began the construction of the American Pacific Fur Company fur-trading post at Fort Astoria, just from the site of Lewis and Clark&#x27;s former Fort Clatsop, completing construction of the first permanent Euro-American settlement in the area in 1811. This settlement later became the nucleus of present-day Astoria, Oregon. During the construction of Fort Astoria, Thompson traveled down the Columbia River, noting the partially constructed American Fort Astoria only two months after the departure of the supply ship &quot;Tonquin&quot;.

Along the way, Thompson had set foot on and claimed for the British Crown the lands near the future Fort Nez Percés site at the confluence of the Columbia and Snake rivers. This claim initiated a very brief era of competition between American and British fur traders. During the War of 1812, Fort Astoria was captured by the British and sold to the North West Company. Under British control, Fort Astoria was renamed Fort George.

In 1821, when the North West Company was merged with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the British Parliament moved to impose the laws of Upper Canada upon British subjects in Columbia District and Rupert&#x27;s Land and issued the authority to enforce those laws to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Chief Factor John McLoughlin was appointed manager of the district&#x27;s operations in 1824. He moved the regional company headquarters to Fort Vancouver (modern Vancouver, Washington) in 1824. Fort Vancouver became the centre of a thriving colony of mixed origin, including Scottish Canadians and Scots, English, French Canadians, Hawaiians, Algonkians, and Iroquois, as well as the offspring of company employees who had intermarried with various local native populations.

Astor continued to compete for Oregon Country furs through his American Fur Company operations in the Rockies. In the 1820s, a few American explorers and traders visited this land beyond the Rocky Mountains. Long after the Lewis and Clark Expedition and also after the consolidation of the fur trade in the region by the Canadian fur companies, American mountain men such as Jedediah Smith and Jim Beckwourth came roaming into and across the Rocky Mountains, following Indian trails through the Rockies to California and Oregon. They sought beaver pelts and other furs, which were obtained by trapping. These were difficult to obtain in the Oregon Country because of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company policy of creating a &quot;fur desert&quot;: deliberate over-hunting of the area&#x27;s frontiers so that American trades would find nothing there. The mountain men, like the Metis employees of the Canadian fur companies, adopted Indian ways, and many of them married Native American women.

Reports of Oregon Country eventually circulated in the eastern United States. Some churches decided to send missionaries to convert the Indians. Jason Lee, a Methodist minister from New York, was the first Oregon missionary. He built a mission school for Indians in the Willamette Valley in 1834. American settlers began to arrive from the east via the Oregon Trail starting in the early 1840s and came in increasing numbers each subsequent year. Increased tension led to the Oregon boundary dispute. Both sides realized that settlers would ultimately decide who controlled the region. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which had previously discouraged settlement as it conflicted with the lucrative fur trade, belatedly reversed its position. In 1841, on orders from Sir George Simpson, James Sinclair guided more than 100 settlers from the Red River Colony to settle on HBC farms near Fort Vancouver. The Sinclair expedition crossed the Rockies into the Columbia Valley, near present-day Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, then traveled southwest down the Kootenai River and Columbia River following the southern portion of the well-established York Factory Express trade route.

The Canadian effort proved to be too little, too late. In what was dubbed &quot;The Great Migration of 1843&quot; or the &quot;Wagon Train of 1843&quot;, an estimated 700 to 1,000 American emigrants came to Oregon, decisively tipping the balance.

==Oregon Treaty==
In 1843, settlers in the Willamette Valley established a provisional government at Champoeg. Political pressure in the United States urged the occupation of all the Oregon Country. Expansionists in the American South wanted to annex Texas, while their counterparts in the northeast wanted to annex the Oregon Country. It was seen as significant that the expansions be parallel, as the relative proximity to other states and territories made it appear likely that Texas would be pro-slavery and Oregon against slavery.

In the 1844 U.S. Presidential election, the Democrats had called for expansion into both areas. After being elected president, however, James K. Polk supported the 49th parallel as a northern limit for U.S. annexation in Oregon Country. Polk&#x27;s uncompromising support for expansion into Texas and relative silence on the Oregon boundary dispute led to the phrase &quot;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!&quot; referring to the northern border of the region and often erroneously attributed to Polk&#x27;s campaign. The goal of the slogan was to rally Southern expansionists (some of whom wanted to annex only Texas in an effort to tip the balance of slave/free states and territories in favor of slavery) to support the effort to annex Oregon Country, appealing to the popular belief in manifest destiny. The British government, meanwhile, sought control of all territory north of the Columbia River.

Despite the posturing, neither country wanted to fight what would have been the third war in 70 years against the other. The two countries eventually reached a peaceful agreement in the 1846 Oregon Treaty that divided the territory west of the Continental Divide along the 49th parallel to Georgia Strait, with Vancouver Island remaining under British control. Today, this border divides British Columbia from neighboring Washington, Idaho, and Montana.

===Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company===
In 1843, the HBC shifted its Columbia Department headquarters from Fort Vancouver to Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island. The plan to move to more northern locations dates back to the 1820s. George Simpson was the main force behind the move north; John McLoughlin became the main hindrance. McLoughlin had devoted his life&#x27;s work to the Columbia business, and his personal interests were increasingly linked to the growing settlements in the Willamette Valley. He fought Simpson&#x27;s proposals to move north in vain. By the time Simpson decided in 1842 to move the headquarters to Vancouver Island, he had many reasons for doing so. There was a dramatic decline in the fur trade across North America. In contrast, the HBC saw increasing profits with coastal exports of salmon and lumber to Pacific markets such as Hawaii. Coal deposits on Vancouver Island had been discovered, and steamships such as the &quot;Beaver&quot; had shown the growing value of coal economically and strategically. A general HBC shift toward Pacific shipping and away from the interior of the continent made Victoria Harbour much more suitable than Fort Vancouver&#x27;s location on the Columbia River. The Columbia Bar at the river&#x27;s mouth was dangerous and routinely meant weeks or months of waiting for ships to cross. The largest ships could not enter the river at all. The growing numbers of American settlers along the lower Columbia gave Simpson reason to question the long-term security of Fort Vancouver. He worried, rightfully so, that the final border resolution would not follow the Columbia River. By 1842, he thought it more likely that the United States would at least demand Puget Sound, and the British government would accept a border as far north as the 49th parallel, excluding Vancouver Island. Despite McLoughlin&#x27;s stalling, the HBC had begun the process of shifting away from Fort Vancouver and toward Vancouver Island and the northern coast in the 1830s. The increasing number of American settlers arriving in the Willamette Valley after 1840 served to make the need more pressing.

===Oregon Territory===
In 1848, the U.S. portion of the Oregon Country was formally organized as the Oregon Territory. In 1849, Vancouver Island became a British Crown colony—the Colony of Vancouver Island—with the mainland being organized into the Colony of British Columbia in 1858. Shortly after the establishment of Oregon Territory, there was an effort to split off the region north of the Columbia River. As a result of the Monticello Convention, Congress approved the creation of Washington Territory in early 1853. President Millard Fillmore approved the new territory on March 2, 1853.

<text>The Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society (BWARS) is a British society dedicated to recording bees, wasps and ants.

The recording of these insects is most important to monitor the health of an ecosystem, and in the past, studies of British ants were carried out by such notable myrmecologists as Horace Donisthorpe and Sir John Lubbock.

<doc id="327350" wikidata="Q53685" url="?curid=327350" title="Taiji (philosophy)">
<text>In Chinese philosophy, taiji () is a cosmological state of the universe and its affairs on all levels, including the mutually reinforcing interactions between the two opposing forces of yin and yang, (a dualistic monism), as well as that among the Three Treasures, the four cardinal directions, and the Five Elements—which together ultimately bring about the myriad things, each with their own nature. The &quot;taiji&quot; concept has reappeared throughout the technological, religious, and philosophical history of the Sinosphere, finding concrete application in techniques developed in acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Taiji&quot; () is a compound of &quot;tai&quot; ( &#x27;great&#x27;, &#x27;supreme&#x27;) and &quot;ji&quot; ( &#x27;pole&#x27;, &#x27;extremity&#x27;). Used together, &quot;taiji&quot; may be understood as &#x27;source of the world&#x27;. Common English translations of &quot;taiji&quot; in the cosmological sense include &quot;Supreme Ultimate&quot;, &quot;Supreme Pole&quot;, and &quot;Great Absolute&quot;.

== Core concept ==
Scholars Zhang and Ryden explain the ontological necessity of &quot;taiji&quot;.
Any philosophy that asserts two elements such as the &quot;yin-yang&quot; of Chinese philosophy will also look for a term to reconcile the two, to ensure that both belong to the same sphere of discourse. The term &#x27;supreme ultimate&#x27; performs this role in the philosophy of the &quot;Book of Changes&quot;. In the Song dynasty it became a metaphysical term on a par with the Way. 

&quot;Taiji&quot; is understood to be the highest conceivable principle from which existence flows. This is very similar to the Daoist idea &quot;reversal is the movement of the Dao&quot;. The &quot;supreme ultimate&quot; creates yang and yin. Movement generates yang, and when its activity reaches its limit, it becomes tranquil. Through tranquility the supreme ultimate generates yin. When tranquility has reached its limit, there is a return to movement. Movement and tranquility, in alternation, become each the source of the other. The distinction between the yin and yang is determined and the two forms (that is, the yin and yang) stand revealed. By the transformations of the yang and the union of the yin, the 4 directions then the 5 phases (&quot;wuxing&quot;) of wood, fire, earth, metal and water.

&quot;Taiji&quot; is often translated as &quot;polar&quot;, with polarity, revealing opposing features as in expanding/contracting, rising/falling, clockwise/ anticlockwise. However, &quot;taiji&quot; has sometimes been thought of as a monistic concept similar to &quot;wuji&quot;, as in the &quot;Wujitu&quot; diagram. &quot;Wuji&quot; literally translates as &quot;without roof pole&quot;, but means without limit, polarity, and/or opposite. Compared with &quot;wuji&quot;, &quot;taiji&quot; describes movement and change wherein limits do arise. While &quot;wuji&quot; is undifferentiated, timeless, absolute, infinite potential, &quot;taiji&quot; is often wrongly portrayed as conflictual, differentiated and dualistic, where as the core to this philosophy is their harmonious, relative and complementary natures.

Yin and yang are reflections and originate from &quot;wuji&quot; to become &quot;taiji&quot;.

== In Chinese texts==
=== &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; ===
The Daoist classic &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; introduced the &quot;taiji&quot; concept. One of the (ca. 3rd century BCE) &quot;Inner Chapters&quot; contrasts &quot;taiji&quot; (here translated as &quot;zenith&quot;) with the &quot;liuji&quot; (). &quot;Liuji&quot; literally means &quot;six ultimates; six cardinal directions&quot;, but here it is translated as &quot;nadir&quot;.

The Way has attributes and evidence, but it has no action and no form. It may be transmitted but cannot be received. It may be apprehended but cannot be seen. From the root, from the stock, before there was heaven or earth, for all eternity truly has it existed. It inspirits demons and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It lies above the zenith but is not high; it lies beneath the nadir but is not deep. It is prior to heaven and earth, but is not ancient; it is senior to high antiquity, but it is not old. 

=== &quot;Huainanzi&quot; ===
The 2nd century BCE &quot;Huainanzi&quot; mentions a &quot;zhenren&quot; (&quot;true person; perfected person&quot;) and the &quot;taiji&quot; that transcends categories like yin and yang, exemplified with the &quot;fusui&quot; and &quot;fangzhu&quot; mirrors.
The &quot;fu-sui&quot; (burning mirror) gathers fire energy from the sun; the &quot;fang-chu&quot; (moon mirror) gathers dew from the moon. What are [contained] between Heaven and Earth, even an expert calculator cannot compute their number. Thus, though the hand can handle and examine extremely small things, it cannot lay hold of the brightness [of the sun and moon]. Were it within the grasp of one&#x27;s hand (within one&#x27;s power) to gather [things within] one category from the Supreme Ultimate (&quot;t&#x27;ai-chi&quot; ) above, one could immediately produce both fire and water. This is because &quot;Yin&quot; and &quot;Yang&quot; share a common &quot;ch&#x27;i&quot; and move each other. 

=== &quot;I Ching&quot; ===
&quot;Taiji&quot; also appears in the &quot;Xici&quot;, a commentary to the &quot;I Ching.&quot; It is traditionally attributed to Confucius but more likely dates to about the 3rd century BCE.
Therefore there is in the Changes the Great Primal Beginning. This generates the two primary forces. The two primary forces generate the four images. The four images generate the eight trigrams. The eight trigrams determine good fortune and misfortune. Good fortune and misfortune create the great field of action. 
This sequence of powers of two includes &quot;taiji&quot; → yin and yang (two polarities) → &quot;Sixiang&quot; (Four Symbols) → &quot;Bagua&quot; (eight trigrams).

The fundamental postulate is the &quot;great primal beginning&quot; of all that exists, &quot;t&#x27;ai chi&quot; – in its original meaning, the &quot;ridgepole&quot;. Later Indian philosophers devoted much thought to this idea of a primal beginning. A still earlier beginning, &quot;wu chi&quot;, was represented by the symbol of a circle. Under this conception, &quot;t&#x27;ai chi&quot; was represented by the circle divided into the light and the dark, yang and yin, . This symbol has also played a significant part in India and Europe. However, speculations of a Gnostic-dualistic character are foreign to the original thought of the &quot;I Ching&quot;; what it posits is simply the ridgepole, the line. With this line, which in itself represents oneness, duality comes into the world, for the line at the same time posits an above and a below, a right and left, front and back – in a word, the world of the opposites. 

=== Song dynasty ===
In the Neo-Confucianism philosophy that developed during the Song dynasty, &quot;taiji&quot; was viewed &quot;as a microcosm equivalent to the structure of the human body.&quot; The Song-era philosopher Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073 CE) wrote the &quot;Taijitushuo&quot; () &quot;Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate&quot;, which became the cornerstone of Neo-Confucianist cosmology. Zhou&#x27;s brief text synthesized aspects of Chinese Buddhism and Daoism with the metaphysical discussions in the &quot;I Ching&quot;. Zhou&#x27;s opening lines are:
Non-polar (&quot;wuji&quot;) and yet Supreme Polarity (&quot;taiji&quot;)! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates &quot;yang&quot;; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates &quot;yin&quot;; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;, the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of &quot;yang&quot; and &quot;yin&quot; generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] &quot;qi&quot; harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;; &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature. 

==In tai chi==

The martial art tai chi draws heavily on Chinese philosophy, especially the concept of the &quot;taiji&quot;. The Chinese name of tai chi, &quot;taijiquan&quot;, literally translates as &quot;taiji boxing&quot; or &quot;taiji fist&quot;. Early tai chi masters such as Yang Luchan promoted the connection between their martial art and the concept of the &quot;taiji&quot;. The twenty-fourth chapter of the &quot;Forty Chapter&quot; tai chi classic that Yang Banhou gave to Wu Quanyou says the following about the connect between tai chi and spirituality:

 If the essence of material substances lies in their phenomenological reality, then the presence of the ontological status of abstract objects shall become clear in the final culmination of the energy that is derived from oneness and the Real. How can man learn this truth? By truly seeking that which is the shadow of philosophy and the charge of all living substances, that of the nature of the divine.

<text>William Parker (born January 10, 1952) is an American free jazz double bassist. Beginning in the 1980s, Parker played with Cecil Taylor for over a decade, and he has led the Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra since 1981. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; named him &quot;the most consistently brilliant free jazz bassist of all time&quot; and &quot;DownBeat&quot; has called him &quot;one of the most adventurous and prolific bandleaders in jazz&quot;.

== Early life and career ==

Parker was born in the Bronx, New York City, and grew up in the Melrose housing project. His first instrument was the trumpet, followed by the trombone and cello. Parker was not formally trained as a classical player, but in his youth studied with Jimmy Garrison, Richard Davis, and Wilbur Ware in learning the tradition.

While Parker has been active since the early 1970s, he first came to public attention playing with pianist Cecil Taylor in the 1980s. He has performed in many of Peter Brötzmann&#x27;s groups, and played with saxophonist David S. Ware from 1989 until his last concert performance in 2011. He is a member of the Other Dimensions In Music cooperative. His work as leader came to greater prominence in the 1990s with groups such as the Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra and In Order to Survive.

Parker&#x27;s &quot;breakout&quot; albums were released in the early 2000s, first with the William Parker Quartet (with saxophonist Rob Brown, drummer Hamid Drake, and trumpeter Lewis Barnes): &quot;O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s Porch&quot; was included in Best of 2001 lists in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;DownBeat&quot;, and the Jazz Journalists Association; in 2002, &quot;Raining on the Moon&quot;, featuring guest Leena Conquest, received rave reviews in publications including &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. The album &quot;Sound Unity&quot; by the William Parker Quartet was chosen as one of Amazon.com&#x27;s Top 100 Editor&#x27;s Picks of 2005. &quot;Petit Oiseau&quot; was chosen as one of the best jazz disks of 2008 by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s Radio Three, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and PopMatters. &quot;Double Sunrise Over Neptune&quot;, also released in 2008, was listed as one of the top 10 2008 (through end of August) Jazz CDs at Amazon.

Increasing prominence throughout the 2000s also led to a revisiting of his back catalogue, with the release of a number of early recordings.

Parker is a prominent musician in the New York City experimental jazz scene, where he leads a number of groups and is associated with the Vision Festival, organized by his wife, the dancer Patricia Nicholson; he is also frequently noted for his community dedication, mentorship, and status as &quot;free-jazz caretaker&quot; and &quot;unofficial mayor of the New York improvisational scene&quot;.

He has performed at music festivals around the world, including the Guelph Jazz Festival in southern Ontario.

Parker frequently plays arco. Bass has been his primary instrument for the duration of his career, but he also plays trumpet, tuba, bamboo flutes, shakuhachi, flute, double reeds, the West African kora, gembri, and donso ngoni, an instrument first introduced to him by Don Cherry.

In 2006, Parker was awarded the Resounding Vision Award from Nameless Sound. In March 2007, his book, &quot;Who Owns Music?&quot;, was published by buddy&#x27;s knife jazzedition in Cologne, Germany. &quot;Who Owns Music?&quot; assembles his political thoughts, poems, and musicological essays. In June 2011, Parker&#x27;s second book, &quot;Conversations&quot;, a collection of interviews with notable free jazz musicians and forward thinkers, mainly from the African-American community, was published by RogueArt.

<doc id="327356" wikidata="Q187742" url="?curid=327356" title="Guelphs and Ghibellines">
<text>The Guelphs and Ghibellines ( , ; ) were factions supporting respectively the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor in the Italian city-states of Central Italy and Northern Italy during the Middle Ages. During the 12th and 13th centuries, rivalry between these two parties dominated political life across medieval Italy. The struggle for power between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire arose with the Investiture Controversy, which began in 1075 and ended with the Concordat of Worms in 1122.

==History==
===Origins===

The conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines arose from the political divisions caused by the Investiture Controversy, about whether secular rulers or the pope had the authority to appoint bishops and abbots. Upon the death of Emperor Henry V, of the Salian dynasty, the dukes elected an opponent of his dynasty, Lothair III, as the new emperor. This displeased the house of Hohenstaufen, who were allied with and related to the old dynasty. Out of fear of the Hohenstaufen, Lothair III placed himself under the pope&#x27;s protection. To this end, he ceded all Imperial rights to the pope under Henry V&#x27;s Concordat of Worms. War then broke out in Germany between those who supported the Hohenstaufen, and those who were aligned to Lothair and the pope. Upon Lothair&#x27;s death, the Hohenstaufen Conrad III was elected, while Lothair&#x27;s heir, Henry the Proud, of the House of Welf, continued fighting.

&quot;Guelph&quot; (often spelled &quot;Guelf&quot;; in Italian &quot;Guelfo&quot;, plural &quot;Guelfi&quot;) is an Italian form of the name of the House of Welf, the family of the dukes of Bavaria (including the namesake Duke Welf II of Bavaria, as well as Henry the Lion). The Welfs were said to have used the name as a rallying cry during the Siege of Weinsberg in 1140, in which the rival Hohenstaufens (led by Conrad III) used &quot;Wibellingen&quot; (the name of a castle today known as Waiblingen, as their cry; &quot;Wibellingen&quot; subsequently became &quot;Ghibellino&quot; in Italian). Thus, the Hohenstaufen faction became known as the Ghibellines and the Welfs eventually became known as the Guelphs. The Ghibellines were the imperial party, while the Guelphs supported the pope. Cities more directly threatened by the enlargement of the Papal States tended to align with the Ghibelline faction, while the cities that wanted more autonomy from the Empire tended to belong to the Guelph faction. The clash between the municipalities of Northern Italy and imperial power originated in the struggle for investitures. The Guelph Lombard League defeated Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Battle of Legnano in 1176. Frederick recognized the full autonomy of the cities of the Lombard league under his nominal suzerainty.

The conflict between the two factions dominated the politics of medieval Italy, and persisted long after the confrontation between emperor and pope had ceased. Smaller cities tended to be Ghibelline if the larger city nearby was Guelph. For example, Guelph Republic of Florence and Ghibelline Republic of Siena faced off at the Battle of Montaperti, 1260. Pisa maintained a staunch Ghibelline stance against her fiercest rivals, the Guelph Republic of Genoa and Florence. Local or regional political reasons motivated political alignments. Within cities, party allegiances differed from guild to guild, &quot;rione&quot; to &quot;rione&quot;, and a city could easily change party after internal upheavals. The conflicts between Guelphs and Ghibellines ended in the 14th century with the creation of a new situation, where the State and the laity began to withdraw from any ecclesiastical interference.

===13th–14th centuries===

At the beginning of the 13th century, Philip of Swabia, a Hohenstaufen, and Otto of Brunswick, a Welf, were rivals for the imperial throne. Philip was supported by the Ghibellines as a son of Frederick I, while Otto was supported by the Guelphs. Although the Guelphs initially succeeded in getting Otto crowned as Emperor, Otto turned against the Papacy, was excommunicated, and was replaced with Philip&#x27;s heir Emperor Frederick II. Frederick II was an enemy of both Otto and the papacy, and during Frederick&#x27;s reign, the Guelphs became more strictly associated with the papacy while the Ghibellines became supporters of the Empire and Frederick in particular. Pope Gregory IX excommunicated Frederick II in 1227 for failing to go on Crusade, then again for going on the Sixth Crusade (1228–1229) while excommunicated. While Frederick was in the Crusader states, this division developed there, and his regent in Italy fought a war with the Pope. That war was ended and the excommunication was lifted in 1230, but the hostility continued.

In 1237, Frederick entered Italy with a large army, intending to subdue the defiant cities of the Lombard League. Pope Gregory tried to broker a peace, but failed. Frederick defeated the League at Cortenuova and refused all peace offers from them. He besieged Brescia but was repulsed. In 1239, Frederick was again excommunicated by Pope Gregory. In response, he expelled Franciscan and the Dominican friars from Lombardy and made his son Enzo Imperial vicar in Italy. He also annexed Romagna, Marche, the Duchy of Spoleto, and part of the Papal States, and marched through Tuscany hoping to capture Rome. He was forced to retreat, sacking the city of Benevento. Soon the Ghibelline city of Ferrara fell and Frederick once more advanced, capturing Ravenna and Faenza. The Pope convened a council, but an Imperial-Pisan fleet defeated a Papal fleet carrying cardinals and prelates from Genoa in the Battle of Giglio. Frederick approached Rome. Meanwhile, Pope Gregory died. Frederick withdrew his forces and freed two cardinals he had jailed in Capua. However, Frederick marched again against Rome throughout 1242 and 1243.

A new pope – Innocent IV – was elected. At first, Frederick was pleased with the election since Innocent had relatives in the Imperial camp. However, the new Pope immediately turned against Frederick. When the City of Viterbo rebelled, the Pope backed the Guelphs. and Frederick immediately marched to Italy and besieged Viterbo. The pope signed a peace treaty with the emperor, relieving the city. After the Emperor left, Cardinal Raniero Capocci, leader of Viterbo, had the garrison massacred. The Pope made another treaty but he immediately broke it and continued to back the Guelphs. The Pope supported Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia as King of the Romans and soon plotted to have Frederick killed. After an attempted assassination failed, the pope fled to Liguria. Soon the tide turned against the imperial party. The Lombard city of Parma rebelled. Enzo – who had not been present – asked his father for help. Frederick and Ezzelino III da Romano, the Tyrant of Verona, laid siege to the city. The imperial camp was ambushed by the Guelphs and in the ensuing Battle of Parma the imperial party was routed, losing much of their treasury.

Frederick lost his momentum against the rebellious communes in the immediate future. Sensing this, Innocent began plans for a crusade against Sicily. Frederick soon recovered and rebuilt an army, but this defeat encouraged resistance in many cities that could no longer bear the fiscal burden of his regime: parts of the Romagna, Marche and Spoleto were lost. In May 1248, Frederick&#x27;s illegitimate son Richard of Chieti defeated a papal army led by Hugo Novellus near Civitanova Marche and recaptured some areas of the Marche and Spoleto. Basing himself in Piedmont in June, Frederick hosted many nobles of northern Italy and ambassadors from foreign kings in his court, and his deposition, it seems, had not diminished his fame or preeminence. Nevertheless, it was only by strenuous, even unrelenting effort that Frederick was able to stabilize the situation by the close of 1248 and replenish his coffers, raising some 130,000 gold ounces. Frederick remained confident but after several years of war and conspiracy, he was increasingly suspicious and wearied.

The Ghibellines were eventually defeated in the Battle of Fossalta against the army of Bologna. Enzo was captured. Enzo was held in a palace in Bologna, where he remained captive until his death in 1272. Richard of Chieti was also killed in 1249, possibly in the same battle. Frederick named Manfred as Legate General of Italy to replace the now captive Enzo.

The struggle continued: the Empire lost Como and Modena, but regained Ravenna. From early 1250, the situation progressively favoured Frederick II. In the first month of the year, the indomitable Ranieri of Viterbo died, depriving pro-papal leadership in Italy of an implacable foe of Frederick. An army sent to invade the Kingdom of Sicily under the command of Cardinal Pietro Capocci was crushed in the Marche at the Battle of Cingoli and Imperial &quot;condottieri&quot; again reconquered the Romagna, the Marche and Spoleto. Conrad, King of the Romans, scored several victories in Germany against William of Holland and forced the pro-papal Rhenish archbishops to sign a truce. Innocent IV was increasingly isolated as support for the papal cause dwindled rapidly in Germany, Italy, and across Europe generally. Frederick of Antioch had relatively stabilized Tuscany as imperial vicar and podestà of Florence. Piacenza changed allegiances to Frederick and Oberto Pallavicino, Imperial vicar of Lombardy, recaptured Parma and a swathe of central Lombardy. Ezzelino da Romano held Verona, Vicenza, Padua and the Trevisan March along with most of eastern Lombardy. Only Milan, Brescia, Modena, Mantua, Ferrara, and Bologna held out. Genoa was threatened by Frederick&#x27;s allies and Venice&#x27;s support for Innocent and the League waned. Even with imperial prospects brightening however, areas of Italy had been ravaged by years of war and even the resources of the wealthy and prosperous Kingdom of Sicily were strained. Frederick&#x27;s unified regime in Italy and Sicily was despotic and brutal, imposing harsh taxes and ruthlessly suppressing dissent. Nevertheless, that his administrative system consistently recovered in the face of reversals remains an impressive feat.

Frederick, however, did not take part in any of the campaigns of 1250. He had been ill and likely felt tired, withdrawing to the Kingdom of Sicily where he remained for much of the year. Suddenly on 13 December 1250, however, after a persistent attack of dysentery, Frederick died in Castel Fiorentino (territory of Torremaggiore), in Apulia. Despite the betrayals, setbacks, and flux of fortune he had faced in his last years, Frederick died peacefully, reportedly wearing the habit of a Cistercian monk. Of his father&#x27;s death, Manfred wrote to Conrad in Germany, &quot;The sun of justice has set, the maker of peace has passed away.&quot;

At the time of Frederick&#x27;s death, his preeminent position in Europe was challenged but certainly not lost. The political situation remained fluid and the victories of 1250 had put Frederick seemingly in the ascendant once again. Everywhere Innocent IV&#x27;s fortunes seemed dire: the papal treasury was depleted, his anti-king William of Holland had been defeated by Conrad in Germany and forced to submit while no other European monarch proved willing to offer much support for fear of Frederick&#x27;s ire. In Italy, Frederick&#x27;s lieutenants and partisans had recaptured much of the territories lost in the last two years; he was in a strong position and he prepared to march on Lyon in the new year. Despite the economic strains placed on the &quot;Regno&quot;, support from the Emperor of Nicaea, John III Doukas Vatatzes, enabled Frederick to relatively refill his coffers and resupply his forces. After the failure of Louis IX&#x27;s crusade in Egypt, Frederick had skillfully imaged himself as the aggrieved party against the papacy, hindered by Innocent&#x27;s machinations from supporting the campaign. Frederick won growing support on the wider diplomatic stage. Only his death halted this momentum. His testament left Conrad the Imperial and Sicilian crowns. Manfred received the principality of Taranto, 100,000 gold ounces, and regency over Sicily and Italy while his half-brother remained in Germany. Henry Charles Otto, Frederick&#x27;s son by Isabella of England, received 100,000 gold ounces and the Kingdom of Arles or that of Jerusalem, while the son of Henry VII was entrusted with the Duchy of Austria and the March of Styria. Perhaps aiming to lay stones for a potential peace settlement between Conrad and Innocent—or a final crafty scheme to further demonstrate papal prejudice against him, Frederick&#x27;s will stipulated that all the lands he had taken from the Church were to be returned to it, all the prisoners freed, and the taxes reduced, provided this did not damage the Empire&#x27;s prestige. In peacefully passing on his realms to his sons Frederick accomplished perhaps the main goal of any ruler. At his death, the Hohenstaufen empire remained the leading power in Europe and its security seemed assured in the persons of his sons.

After the death of Frederick II in 1250, the Ghibellines were supported by Conrad IV and later King Manfred of Sicily. The Guelphs were supported by Charles I of Naples. The Ghibellines of Siena defeated the Florentine Guelphs at the Battle of Montaperti (1260). After the Hohenstaufen dynasty lost the Empire when Charles I executed Conradin in 1268, the terms Guelph and Ghibelline became associated with individual families and cities, rather than with the conflict between empire and papacy. The stronghold of Italian Ghibellines was the city of Forlì, in Romagna. That city remained with the Ghibelline factions, partly as a means of preserving its independence, rather than out of loyalty to the temporal power, as Forlì was nominally in the Papal States. Over the centuries, the papacy tried several times to regain control of Forlì, sometimes by violence or by allurements.

The division between Guelphs and Ghibellines was especially important in Florence. The two factions frequently fought each other over power in many other northern Italian cities. The two sides were now fighting either against German influence (in the case of the Guelphs) or against the temporal power of the Pope (in the case of the Ghibellines). In Florence and elsewhere, the Guelphs usually included merchants and burghers, while the Ghibellines tended to be noblemen. To identify themselves, people adopted distinctive customs such as wearing a feather on a particular side of their hats, or cutting fruit a particular way, according to their affiliation.

The conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines was important in the Republic of Genoa, where the former were called &quot;rampini&quot; (&quot;grappling hooks&quot;) and the latter &quot;mascherati&quot; (&quot;masked&quot;), although the origin of these terms is not clear. Local families like Fieschi and Grimaldi usually sided with the Guelph party, in conflict with the Doria and some branches of the Spinola families. While Genoa was often under Guelph rule in the early years of the 13th century, in 1270, Ghibellines Oberto Spinola and Oberto Doria revolted against the Guelphs and established a separate government which lasted a couple of decades. Guelph families fled to their strongholds east (Fieschi) and west (Grimaldi). They were forced to cease their resistance after several military campaigns: they were again accepted in the city&#x27;s political life, after paying war expenses.

===White and Black Guelphs===

After the Tuscan Guelphs finally defeated the Ghibellines in 1289 at the Battle of Campaldino and at Vicopisano, the Guelphs began infighting. By 1300, the Florentine Guelphs had divided into the Black and White Guelphs. The Blacks continued to support the Papacy, while the Whites were opposed to Papal influence, specifically the influence of Pope Boniface VIII. Dante was among the supporters of the White Guelphs. In 1302 he was exiled when the Black Guelphs took control of Florence.

Those who were not connected to either side or who had no connections to either Guelphs or Ghibellines considered both factions unworthy of support but were still affected by changes of power in their respective cities. Emperor Henry VII was disgusted by supporters of both sides when he visited Italy in 1310. In 1325, the city-states of Guelph Bologna and Ghibelline Modena clashed in the War of the Bucket, resulting in Modena&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Zappolino, which led to a resurgence of Ghibelline fortunes. In 1334, Pope Benedict XII threatened people who used either the Guelph or Ghibelline name with excommunication.

===Later history===

The term Ghibelline continued to indicate allegiance to the declining Imperial authority in Italy, and saw a brief resurgence during the Italian campaigns of Emperors Henry VII (1310) and Louis IV (1327). Since the Pope granted Sicily (Southern Italy) to the French prince Charles I of Anjou, the Guelphs took a pro-French stance. As late as the 16th century, Ghibellines like the Colonna or Gonzaga still fought for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, while Guelphs like the Orsini and Este still fought for the French. During the French-dominated Avignon Papacy, Pope John XXII, who supported the French-allied King John of Bohemia, excommunicated John&#x27;s rival Emperor Louis IV in 1324 and threatened heresy charges against the Ghibellines. The Ghibellines then supported Louis&#x27; invasion of Italy and coronation as King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor. The conflict over Naples broke out again when it was conquered by Aragon in 1442 and remained fought over between the Habsburgs and Bourbons until the Bourbons gained control for good following War of the Polish Succession in 1735.

In Milan, the Guelphs and Ghibellines cooperated in the creation of the Golden Ambrosian Republic in 1447. However, over the next few years they engaged in intense disputes. After the initial leadership of the Ghibellines, the Guelphs seized power at the election of the Captains and Defenders of the Liberty of Milan. The Guelph government became increasingly autocratic, leading to a Ghibelline conspiracy led by Giorgio Lampugnino and Teodoro Bossi. It failed, and many Ghibellines were massacred in 1449. Others fled, including the prominent Ghibelline Vitaliano I Borromeo, who was sheltered in his County of Arona. Public opinion turned against the Guelphs. In the next elections the Ghibellines were briefly victorious, but were deposed after imprisoning Guelph leaders Giovanni Appiani and Giovanni Ossona. After Francesco I Sforza was made Duke by Milan&#x27;s senate in 1450, many Ghibellines who had fled such as Filippo Borromeo and Luisino Bossi were restored to positions of prominence in Milan.

In the 15th century, the Guelphs supported Charles VIII of France during his invasion of Italy at the start of the Italian Wars, while the Ghibellines were supporters of the emperor Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. Cities and families used the names until Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, consolidated the imperial power over Italy in 1529. In the course of the Italian Wars of 1494 to 1559, the political landscape changed radically and the division between Guelphs and Ghibellines became irrelevant. This became evident with the election of Pope Paul V (1605), the first to bear the &quot;Ghibelline&quot; in &quot;chief&quot; on his Papal coat of arms.

===Modern aftermath===

On 25 March 2015, the &quot;Parte Guelfa&quot; was reconstituted as a Christian order and archconfraternity to serve the Catholic Church and the Catholic Archdiocese of Florence, guided by the Captain-General Andrea Claudio Galluzzo under the custody of Consul Luciano Artusi. The Mayor of Florence established the headquarters of the reborn Guelph Party in the historic Palazzo di Parte Guelfa in the city.

==Allegiance of the main Italian cities==
==Allegiance of the main Italian families==
==In heraldry==

Some individuals and families indicated their faction affiliation in their coats of arms by including an appropriate heraldic &quot;chief&quot; (a horizontal band at the top of the shield). Guelphs had a &quot;capo d&#x27;Angiò&quot; or &quot;chief of Anjou&quot;, containing yellow fleurs-de-lys on a blue field, with a red heraldic &quot;label&quot;, while Ghibellines had a &quot;capo dell&#x27;impero&quot; or &quot;chief of the empire&quot;, with a form of the black German imperial eagle on a golden background. Families also distinguished their factional allegiance by the architecture of their palaces, towers, and fortresses. Ghibelline structures had &quot;swallow-tailed&quot; crenellations, while those of the Guelphs were square.

== In vexillology ==
During the 12th and 13th centuries, armies of the Ghibelline communes usually adopted the war banner of the Holy Roman Empirewhite cross on a red fieldas their own. Guelph armies usually reversed the colorsred cross on white. These two schemes are prevalent in the civic heraldry of northern Italian towns and remain a revealing indicator of their past factional leanings.

==In art and popular culture==

===In literature===

* In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (1300s), participants in the conflict are featured prominently. For example, Mosca dei Lamberti is the character suffering in hell for the schism for which he was held responsible.
* In &quot;The Decameron&quot; (1350s) by Giovanni Boccaccio, one of the ladies is a firm adherent of the Ghibellines.
* The &quot;Life of Castruccio Castracani&quot; (1520) by Niccolò Machiavelli tells the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines in the city of Lucca during the reign of Tuscan condottiere Castruccio Castracani.
* In the notes to the poem &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot; (1579), English poet Edmund Spenser&#x27;s annotator E. K. claimed (incorrectly) that the words &quot;Elfs&quot; and &quot;Goblins&quot; derive etymologically from Guelphs and Ghibellines.
* The Shakespeare play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is believed to have been based of the conflict as the city of Verona had switched hands often between the two groups. Shakespeare may have also based the Capulet and Montague families on the two groups.
* &quot;Valperga&quot; (1823) is a historical novel by Mary Shelley influenced heavily by both Dante and Boccaccio, that deals directly with the Guelph and Ghibelline conflict. Its central figure, Castruccio Castracani, is a Ghibelline, while his love, the Duchess of Valperga, is a Guelph.
* In Schopenhauer&#x27;s essay &quot;On Women&quot;, he claimed that women are usually unfriendly toward each other. The reason is that &quot;with women only one thing is decisive, namely, which man they please.&quot; Schopenhauer asserted that &quot;Even when they meet in the street, women look at one another like Guelphs and Ghibellines.&quot; (&quot;Schon beim Begegnen auf der Straße sehn sie einander an wie Guelfen und Ghibellinen.&quot;)
* In &quot;The Cantos&quot; (1915–1962), Ezra Pound makes repeated mention of both Guelfs and Ghibellines. The pro-Papal Guelfs are associated with usury and corruption while the pro-Imperial Ghibellines are associated with law and order. The famous &quot;fascist&quot; canto, LXXII, makes mention of Ezalino (who would appear to be the sometime-Ghibelline leader Ezzelino III da Romano), &quot;who didn&#x27;t believe the world was made by a Jew&quot; (i.e., he rejected papal and Christian claims and embraced the antisemitism of World War II in the fascist milieu in which the Canto was written).
* In &quot;Christ Stopped at Eboli&quot; (1945), Carlo Levi compares the peasants and gentry of Aliano to the Guelphs and Ghibellines, respectively, with the Fascist regime as the Holy Roman Empire and the desire to be left alone for local rule as the Papacy.
* In &quot;The Lost Steps&quot; (1953), by Alejo Carpentier, the narrator refers to the Guelphs and Ghibellines to describe the nature of the sudden guerrilla fighting that breaks out in the streets of a Latin American city.
* In &quot;The Quentaris Chronicles&quot; fantasy book series (2003–2009), the Duelphs and Nibhellines are feuding families based on the Guelphs and Ghibellines.
* In &quot;A Room with a View&quot;, book written by E. M. Forster in 1908, there is a reference to the Guelph and Ghibelline conflict in the first chapter after Miss Bartlett and Mr Beeb&#x27;s conflict, when one of the little old ladies comes to chatter. In the book there is a spelling mistake where Guelphs is written &quot;Guelfs&quot;; this could be attributed to the Italian spelling of the word.

===In film===
* &quot;The Flame and the Arrow&quot; (1950) starring Burt Lancaster, Virginia Mayo and Nick Cravat is set in the Guelph and Ghibelline era of 12th century Lombardy.
* &quot;Barbarossa&quot; (2009) starring Rutger Hauer, Raz Degan and F. Murray Abraham is set during the struggles between Guelph and Ghibellines and in particular during the battle of Legnano.
* In Jeff Baena&#x27;s &quot;The Little Hours&quot; (2017), based on &quot;The Decameron&quot;, Nick Offerman plays a minor Lord given to long, rambling conspiracy theories about how the Guelphs are coming for him.

=== In music ===
* Riccardo Zandonai&#x27;s early 20th-century opera &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; follows a plot of the character from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, part of which includes a battle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines.

<text>Myrmecology (; from Greek: , &quot;myrmex&quot;, &quot;ant&quot; and λόγος, &quot;logos&quot;, &quot;study&quot;) is a branch of entomology focusing on the study of ants. Ants continue to be a model of choice for the study of questions on the evolution of social systems because of their complex and varied forms of social organization. Their diversity and prominence in ecosystems also has made them important components in the study of biodiversity and conservation. In the 2000s, ant colonies began to be studied and modeled for their relevance in machine learning, complex interactive networks, stochasticity of encounter and interaction networks, parallel computing, and other computing fields.

==History==
The word myrmecology was coined by William Morton Wheeler (1865–1937), although human interest in the life of ants goes back to ancient times. The earliest scientific thinking based on observation of ant life was that of Auguste Forel (1848–1931), a Swiss psychologist who initially was interested in ideas of instinct, learning, and society. In 1874 he wrote a book on the ants of Switzerland, &quot;Les fourmis de la Suisse&quot;, and he named his home &quot;La Fourmilière&quot; (the ant colony). Forel&#x27;s early studies included attempts to mix species of ants in a colony. He noted polydomy and monodomy in ants and compared them with the structure of nations.

Wheeler looked at ants in a new light, in terms of their social organization, and in 1910 he delivered a lecture at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on &quot;The Ant-Colony as an Organism&quot;, which pioneered the idea of superorganisms. Wheeler considered trophallaxis or the sharing of food within the colony as the core of ant society. This was studied using a dye in the food and observing how it spread in the colony.

Some, such as Horace Donisthorpe, worked on the systematics of ants. This tradition continued in many parts of the world until advances in other aspects of biology were made. The advent of genetics, and ideas in ethology and its evolution, led to new thought. This line of enquiry was pioneered by E. O. Wilson, who founded the field termed as sociobiology.

==Interdisciplinary application==

Ants often are studied by engineers for biomimicry and by network engineers for more efficient networking. It is not known clearly how ants manage to avoid congestions and how they optimize their movements to move in most efficient ways without a central authority that would send out orders. There already have been many applications in structure design and networking that have been developed from studying ants, but the efficiency of human-created systems is still not close to the efficiency of ant colonies. Furthermore, there are efforts to use ant algorithms and the behavioral strategies of ants in modern management.

<text>Matthew Shipp (born December 7, 1960) is an American avant-garde jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader.

== Early life and education ==
Shipp was raised in Wilmington, Delaware. His mother was a friend of trumpeter Clifford Brown.

He began playing piano at five years old. Shipp was strongly attracted to jazz, but also played in rock groups while in high school.

Shipp attended the University of Delaware for &quot;a couple years&quot; before dropping out. He opted instead to live with his parents and focus on practicing, though he frequently traveled to Philadelphia to pick up gigs as a cocktail pianist and to study with Dennis Sandole, who Shipp has cited as playing an important role in his development.

He later spent a year at the New England Conservatory of Music, where he studied with saxophonist and composer Joe Maneri, but again dropped out without completing a degree.

== Career ==

Shipp moved to New York in 1984 and has been very active since the early 1990s, appearing on dozens of albums as a leader, sideman, or producer. (Before making a living playing music, Shipp worked in a bookshop as an assistant manager. He was fired, he threw some books at his boss, and he decided he would not look for a day job anymore.)He was initially most active in free jazz but has since branched out, particularly exploring music that touches on contemporary classical, hip hop, and electronica. Earlier in his career Shipp was compared to some of his predecessors in the jazz piano pantheon, but has since been recognized as a complete stylistic innovator on the piano, with &quot;AllMusic&quot; referring to his &quot;unique, instantly recognizable style&quot;, and Larry Blumenfeld in &quot;Jazziz&quot; magazine referring to Shipp as &quot;stunning in originality&quot; and to his album &quot;4D&quot; as &quot;further proof of his idiosyncratic genius&quot;.

Shipp has also been celebrated by a wide range of artists: David Bowie has praised his work (specifically &quot;Rocket Shipp&quot; from the album &quot;Nu Bop&quot;), and Thurston Moore, who first saw him perform in 1990, has complimented his cross-genre appeal: &quot;I see the same people showing up for Matthew&#x27;s gigs as for Merzbow&quot;. (As a member of the David S. Ware Quartet, Shipp has opened for Sonic Youth.) Shipp has also been noted for his association with punk-rock icon Henry Rollins, who released several of Shipp&#x27;s records on his 213 imprint. In 2010, Rollins wrote, &quot;Matthew Shipp and his work have fascinated me since I first heard him many years ago. His originality and approach sometimes stretches the limits of what is considered Jazz music yet at the same time, describes perfectly the fierce freedom of it. ... Matthew is not only a brilliant Jazz pianist, he is a true artist and visionary.&quot; In the early 1990s Shipp also befriended Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power), then his next-door neighbor.

One of the first people Shipp sought out upon arriving in New York was William Parker, who he knew from his recordings with Cecil Taylor; Parker later recommended him for saxophonist David S. Ware&#x27;s quartet, alongside Parker himself and a series of drummers (Marc Edwards, Susie Ibarra, Guillermo E. Brown, Whit Dickey). As a member of Ware&#x27;s quartet, Shipp recorded albums for Homestead (&quot;Cryptology&quot; and &quot;DAO&quot;), Thirsty Ear (&quot;Threads&quot;, &quot;Live in the World&quot;, &quot;BalladWare&quot;), AUM Fidelity (the label&#x27;s first release, &quot;Wisdom of Uncertainty&quot;, as well as &quot;Corridors &amp; Parallels&quot;, &quot;Freedom Suite&quot;, and &quot;Renunciation&quot;), Silkheart (&quot;Great Bliss, Vol. 1&quot; &quot;Great Bliss, Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;Oblations and Blessings&quot;), Columbia (&quot;Go See the World&quot;, &quot;Surrendered&quot;), and DIW (&quot;Flight of I&quot;, &quot;Third Ear Recitation&quot;, &quot;Earthquation&quot;, &quot;Godspelized&quot;).

In addition, the rhythm section of Shipp, Parker, and Brown recorded Ware compositions without Ware in 2003, released by Splasc(H) Records as &quot;The Trio Plays Ware&quot;, and Shipp and Ware performed as a duo, recorded in concert and released by AUM Fidelity as &quot;Live in Sant&#x27;Anna Arresi, 2004&quot;. In 2001, Gary Giddens wrote for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that &quot;The David S. Ware Quartet is the best small band in jazz today&quot;. After Ware&#x27;s death, Shipp wrote, &quot;Some have compared our unit to the classic Coltrane quartet, but the members of our group all brought something to the table that only someone playing now could bring—resulting in a gestalt that is of its time and does not look back. When free jazz seemed like a spent force, he brought something new—and greatly beautiful—to it.&quot;

Shipp was also a member of Roscoe Mitchell&#x27;s Note Factory, which Shipp said &quot;could be seen as an extension of some post-Coltrane concepts, but in Roscoe&#x27;s hands it is extended technique with multiple pulses&quot;, noting &quot;[Mitchell&#x27;s] insistence at all times of transcending cliché&quot;.

Shipp has recorded or performed with many other musicians, including High Priest and Beans of Antipop Consortium, Michael Bisio, Daniel Carter, DJ Spooky, El-P, Mat Maneri, Joe Morris, Ivo Perelman, Mat Walerian, Allen Lowe, and Chad Fowler. He has also co-led the group East Axis, with bassist Kevin Ray, drummer Gerald Cleaver, and saxophonists Allen Lowe (first album) and Scott Robinson (second album).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has noted Shipp&#x27;s curatorial work for Thirsty Ear Records as &quot;one of the label&#x27;s chief consultants and most prolific artists&quot;. Shipp&#x27;s own releases on the label include 2011&#x27;s double-disc album, entitled &quot;Art of the Improviser&quot;; &quot;AllMusic&quot; called the work a &quot;testament to Shipp&#x27;s achievements, yet it is also a continuation of the discovery in his developmental musical language&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the project &quot;monumental&quot; and &quot;galvanic as ever&quot;. Thirsty Ear also released Shipp&#x27;s 2013 solo record &quot;Piano Sutras&quot;, which &quot;PopMatters&quot; described as &quot;the kind of record we talk about and play for each other decades later ... music that frames up a whole history: of an artist, of listeners, of the artists who formed the history of the art form, of the culture and time that allowed this art to flourish&quot;. This was followed by 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Conduct of Jazz&quot;, the first album by Shipp&#x27;s trio with bassist Michael Bisio and drummer Newman Taylor Baker.

Shipp&#x27;s work with the France-based RogueArt imprint began with the 2006 album &quot;Salute to 100001 Stars: A Tribute to Jean Genet&quot; by the group Declared Enemy (Sabir Mateen, Shipp, William Parker, and Gerald Cleaver). From 2006 to 2013, Shipp appeared on five albums released through RogueArt, one of which (&quot;Un Piano&quot;) billed Shipp as leader; from 2015 to 2022, the label put out six more albums with Shipp as leader, and another nine on which he was co-billed with, among others, Mark Helias, Nate Wooley, William Parker, Mat Maneri, John Butcher, and Evan Parker. Shipp&#x27;s work on RogueArt, along with biographical material and placement of Shipp&#x27;s artistic evolution within the context of the downtown Manhattan avant-garde jazz scene, is the subject of music journalist Clifford Allen&#x27;s 2023 book &quot;Singularity Codex: Matthew Shipp on RogueArt&quot;; the Burning Ambulance review by Todd Manning declares that &quot;&quot;Singularity Codex&quot; examines so many aspects of [Shipp&#x27;s] life and the scene around him that it is not only indispensable to anyone trying to come to a deeper understanding of his work but also for those wanting to study the avant-garde jazz scene of New York City’s Lower East Side.&quot;

Shipp began working with ESP-Disk with the Shipp/Mat Walerian duo album &quot;Live at Okuden&quot;, billed as The Uppercut. Issued in 2015, it was the last new release approved by ESP-Disk&#x27;s founder Bernard Stollman. All four of Walerian&#x27;s albums with Shipp have been released on ESP-Disk’. Shipp&#x27;s first ESP albums as leader were a quartet album, &quot;Sonic Fiction&quot;, and a solo album, &quot;Zer0&quot;, both issued in 2018. After that, he released several albums by his trio with Michael Bisio and Newman Taylor Baker: &quot;Signature&quot;, &quot;The Unidentifiable&quot;, &quot;World Construct&quot;, and &quot;New Concepts in Piano Trio Jazz&quot;. &quot;World Construct&quot; was called &quot;a career-defining album&quot; and awarded five stars by critic Mike Hobart in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, while &quot;New Concepts in Piano Trio Jazz&quot; was called by Tony Dudley Evans (London Jazz Times) &quot;an album of great beauty that is state of the art in terms of the possibilities of the jazz piano trio.&quot; In 2022 a duo album by Shipp and Ivo Perelman, &quot;Fruition&quot;, was released by ESP, with NPR&#x27;s Nate Chinen stating in his review, &quot;The freeform alchemy between Brazilian saxophonist Ivo Perelman and American pianist Matthew Shipp is by now a proven fact: rarely do two musicians achieve a higher flow state in real time.&quot;

In 2020, longtime Shipp collaborator Whit Dickey started a label called Tao Forms; as of January 2023, the label had released two Shipp albums, &quot;The Piano Equation&quot; and &quot;Codebreaker&quot;, both solo releases, and four further albums on which he collaborates.

<text>Pierre Granche (; March 14, 1948 – September 30, 1997) was a French-Canadian sculptor. Having studied at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal and the Université de Vincennes in Paris, he taught in the art history department of the Université de Montréal for more than twenty years (1975–1997) until his death from lung cancer in Montreal.

As a sculptor, his works are mainly abstract semi-representational pieces, many in aluminium. He was highly influential in the Quebec art world for his method of integrating art and architecture.

==Public artworks==
Some of his public artworks include:

*&quot;32 fois passera, le dernier s&#x27;envolera&quot;, a collection of vertical glass screens with plant forms in aluminum, symbolising education, in the courtyard of the Pavillon J-A-de Sève, UQAM, Montreal;
*&quot;Lieu re-découvert&quot;, an environmental intervention of a variety of truncated pyramid shapes, Le Gardeur hospital, Repentigny, Quebec;
*&quot;Égalité / équivalence&quot;, a grouping of sculptures representing dogs, winged men, and gardens, Université Laval, Quebec City;

<text>Fan Zhongzheng (c. 960 – c. 1030), courtesy name Zhongli, better known by his pseudonym Fan Kuan (), was a Chinese landscape painter of the Song dynasty. He was both a Daoist and a Neo-Confucianist.

&quot;Travelers among Mountains and Streams&quot;, a large hanging scroll, is Fan Kuan&#x27;s best known work, possibly his only surviving one, and a seminal painting of the Northern Song school. It establishes an ideal in monumental landscape painting to which later painters were to return time and again for inspiration. The classic Chinese perspective of three planes is evident - near, middle (represented by water and mist), and far. Unlike earlier examples of Chinese landscape art, the grandeur of nature is the main theme, rather than merely providing a backdrop. A packhorse train can barely be seen emerging from a wood at the base of a towering precipice. The painting&#x27;s style encompasses archaic conventions dating back to the Tang dynasty.

The historian Patricia Ebrey explains her view on the painting that the:

...foreground, presented at eye level, is executed in crisp, well-defined brush strokes. Jutting boulders, tough scrub trees, a mule train on the road, and a temple in the forest on the cliff are all vividly depicted. There is a suitable break between the foreground and the towering central peak behind, which is treated as if it were a backdrop, suspended and fitted into a slot behind the foreground. There are human figures in this scene, but it is easy to imagine them overpowered by the magnitude and mystery of their surroundings.

Fan&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;Travellers among Mountains and Streams&quot; bears a lost half-hidden signature rediscovered only in 1958.

<text>Edward Patrick &quot;Mickey&quot; Walker (July 13, 1903 (some sources indicate 1901) – April 28, 1981) was an American professional boxer who held both the world welterweight and world middleweight championships at different points in his career. Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, he was also an avid golfer and would later be recognized as a renowned artist. Walker is widely considered one of the greatest fighters ever, with ESPN ranking him 17th on their list of the 50 Greatest Boxers of All-Time and boxing historian Bert Sugar placing him 11th in his Top 100 Fighters catalogue. Statistical website BoxRec rates Walker as the 6th best boxer to have ended his career at middleweight, while &quot;The Ring Magazine&quot; founder Nat Fleischer placed him at No. 4 among greatest middleweights of all time. The International Boxing Research Organization ranked Walker as the No. 4 middleweight and the No. 16 pound-for-pound fighter of all-time. Walker was inducted into the Ring magazine Hall of Fame in 1957 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame as a first-class member in 1990. 

== Professional career ==

=== Career beginnings ===
Walker boxed professionally for the first time on February 10, 1919, fighting Dominic Orsini to a four-round no-decision in his hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey. Walker did not venture from Elizabeth until his eighteenth bout, when he went to fight at Newark. On April 29, 1919, he was defeated by knockout in round one by Phil Delmontt, suffering his first defeat.

In 1920, he boxed twelve times, winning two and participating in ten no-decisions. Once again, all his bouts were held in New Jersey, which was, at the time, one of the areas where scoring systems had not been instituted in boxing. Each fight that lasted the scheduled distance was automatically declared a no-decision, regardless of who the better boxer had been.

=== World welterweight champion ===
Walker boxed sixteen times in 1921, winning six, losing one and having nine no-decisions. By then, Rhode Island had become one of the areas where decisions from points scoring had been legislated and this attracted Walker. He lost on a disqualification to Joe Stenafik his first time there, but earned his first decision win in twelve rounds against Kid Green the second time around. He also met world champion boxer Jack Britton in a no-decision in New Jersey and beat Nate Siegal in Boston.

In 1922, Walker went 3–4–4 before getting a world title shot. He lost to Jock Malone that year. However, on November 1, 1922, he fought for the world welterweight title against Britton, the reigning champion. Walker outpointed Britton over fifteen rounds to take the title.

=== Walker vs. Greb ===
Walker had thirteen fights in 1923, winning 11, having one no-decision and one no contest. He defended the title twice, against Pete Latzo and Jimmy Jones. Nine bouts followed in 1924, Walker winning six and having three no decisions. He defeated Lew Tendler and Bobby Barrett in defense of his world title and had two of his three no-decisions that year against Jock Malone.

After winning two fights to start 1925, he went up in division to challenge world middleweight champion Harry Greb on July 2 but failed to win the middleweight crown at that time, losing a fifteen-round decision to the division champion. He went back to the welterweight division, defending his title against Dave Shade and retaining it by decision. He won three bouts, lost one and had three no-decisions that year.

=== World middleweight champion ===

On May 20, 1926, Walker lost the world welterweight title in a rematch with Pete Latzo. It seemed Walker, now in his 20s, had physically matured out the welterweight division, though many might also point to his extra-curricular activities. Whatever the reasons, Walker then began concentrating on winning the world middleweight championship. On November 22, he finally was able to beat Jock Malone. On December 3, he claimed the world middleweight title with a controversial ten-round decision over world champion Tiger Flowers. He kept that title for five years, defending it three times. He beat Mike McTigue and former world champion Paul Berlenbach.

On March 28, 1929, he tried to become a member of the exclusive group of boxers who have been world champions in three different weight divisions, but lost a close ten-round decision to world light heavyweight champion Tommy Loughran. On June 19, 1931, Walker decided to vacate his world middleweight title and move up to the heavyweight division.

=== Later career ===
Walker&#x27;s debut as a heavyweight on July 22 against former world heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey ended with a fifteen-round draw (tie). In 1932, he went 5–1, beating such fighters as King Levinsky and Paulino Uzcudun before facing former world heavyweight champion Max Schmeling, who knocked Walker out in round eight.

He went down in weight again, to the light heavyweight division in 1933, when he lost a fifteen-round decision to Maxie Rosenbloom for the world title. The next year, Walker fought Rosenbloom again and was awarded a decision win. Unfortunately for Walker, Rosenbloom remained the champion, having taken Walker on in a non-title fight. Undaunted, Walker kept campaigning in that division until 1935, when he retired after losing to Eric Seelig by a seven-round technical knockout.

== Retirement and death==
After retiring from boxing, Walker opened a New York City restaurant that became a popular landmark. He became an accomplished painter, with many of his works exhibited at New York and London art galleries. During his boxing career, he found golf to be a suitable distraction to his training regimen and he often dragged his manager, Doc Kearns, and his kids to golf courses to play golf.

Walker said on the January 13, 1955 &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; show that he was married and had two daughters. He also said he &quot;fought a draw for the heavyweight title.&quot;

Walker was found by police in 1974 lying on a street in Freehold, NJ and taken to a hospital, where he was admitted with doctors initially thinking he was just a drunk lying on the street. Tests revealed Walker was suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s Syndrome, arteriosclerosis and anemia. He was admitted to Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital for treatment. He died on April 28, 1981, in Freehold.

<text>The Battle of Sarhū () refers to a series of battles between the Later Jin dynasty (the predecessor of the Qing dynasty) and the Ming dynasty and their Joseon allies in 1619. The battle is notable for the heavy use of cavalry by the Later Jin in defeating Ming and Joseon forces equipped with hand cannons, cannons, and matchlocks.

== Background ==
Prior to the battle, Nurhaci had unified the Jurchen people, excluding the Yehe, and took a hostile attitude towards the Ming for favoritism and meddling in the affairs of the Jurchen tribes. In 1618, he proclaimed his Seven Grievances (&quot;nadan amba koro&quot; 七大恨) with the Ming to Heaven and subsequently declared war on the Ming. He occupied Fushun, Qinghe (清河), and other cities before retreating. The death of the Ming Vice-General Zhang Chengyin (張承蔭) during the Battle of Fushun stunned the Ming court. In 1619, he attacked the Yehe (葉赫) in an attempt to provoke the Ming. The Ming responded by dispatching expeditionary forces led by Military Commissioner Yang Hao to besiege the Later Jin capital Hetu Ala from four routes.

==Organization==
==Course of battle==
=== Western Route ===
Du Song&#x27;s forces set off west from Shenyang on the night of the 29th of the 2nd lunar month under torchlight. He had orders to arrive at Yagu Gate on the 2nd of the 3rd lunar month, so he arrived the next day at Fushun, 100 li (里) away, and captured the undefended city. Du&#x27;s army was delayed by snow and stayed at Fushun for some time, but Du grew impatient and set forth with his army after 10 days despite the unfavorable conditions.

When they arrived at the Hun River, the Jin had already set up defences on the other side of the river. Du Song was advised to camp for the night, but he refused and took 10,000 men with him across the river to attack Jin defenses, while leaving 20,000 with the artillery train and baggage on the other side. One source accuses him of drunkenness having clouded his judgment that night. He was asked to wear armor prior to the crossing, but he replied that being in the military for this many years, he did not know how heavy armor was as he never wore it, and crossed the river. When his forces were halfway across, Nurhaci ordered his bannermen to break the dams they had prepared and Du&#x27;s men had to abandon their equipment to escape the current. The commander in charge of artillery and baggage was supposed to coordinate the crossing following Du, but he refused due to the river&#x27;s turbulence.

That night, Du Song divided his forces into two camps, one at Sarhu Mountain Pass and one at Jilin Cliff where he camped. Nurhaci sent his sons Hong Taiji and Daišan with a banner each to keep Du Song occupied at Jilin Cliff and he himself took six banners and attacked the Sarhu camp.

The Sarhu camp held off the initial Jin assault but fell into an ambush while in pursuit of the enemy and were driven toward the river. Ming musketeers tried to reform ranks and fire their guns but were flanked by Jin cavalry which broke their formation and shattered their morale.

Nurhaci then concentrated all his forces against Du&#x27;s camp and laid siege to it. Du&#x27;s forces were completely surrounded and their firearms only made their location more evident to their enemies. Du and the other two generals, Wang Xuan and Zhao Menglin, were killed in combat while trying to occupy a high ground near the river. Du Song died from an arrow supposedly fired by Laimbu, 13th son of Nurhaci. The Jin chased the shattered Ming remnants for 20 li before regrouping to form ranks. Then they headed off to confront Ma Lin&#x27;s forces at Xiangjiayan.

=== Northern Route ===
Upon receiving news of the Western Route&#x27;s demise, Ma Lin grew more cautious. He divided his forces in two and together with the remnants of Du Song&#x27;s army, mainly supply units, formed three fortified camps at Xiangjiayan (Siyanggiyan), protected by cannons and trenches.

Nurhaci concentrated his forces on Ma Lin&#x27;s own camp. He first sent a contingent of horsemen to scout out their defenses. Then he ordered a thousand infantry to draw fire while Nurhaci led his banners to surround the Ming encampment and conduct a surprise attack. Nurhaci&#x27;s banners were so rapid that Ma&#x27;s gunners could only get off one volley before the Jin were upon them. Ming forces panicked and were cut down by Jin cavalry. The rearguard attempted to rally under Pan Zongyan and his Yihe (Jurchen) allies, but this proved futile, and the army&#x27;s morale broke. Ma Lin escaped as half of his troops were killed or captured. The other two camps also fell in quick succession.

=== Eastern Route ===
Yang Hao issued commands to retreat and regroup, but Liu Ting never received the message.

Nurhaci and Daišan returned to Hetu Ala with 4,000 troops to recuperate.

The Jin decided to attack Liu Ting next, as Li Rubai&#x27;s forces were mainly traversing mountain paths. Unlike Du Song and Ma Lin, Liu had experienced some small success in defeating advance Jin scouts, resulting in the capture of three fortresses, the death of two Jin generals, as well as 3,000 casualties on the Jin side.

Before he left, Nurhaci ordered some of his troops to disguise themselves as Ming soldiers and mix into Liu Ting&#x27;s entourage. His spies posed as Du Song&#x27;s messengers and delivered a false letter to Liu Ting stating that Du Song was already fast approaching Hetu Ala, requesting him to speed up. Liu took the bait and increased the army&#x27;s pace which caused his troops to lose cohesion as they advanced deep into a valley.

Liu Ting was ambushed in Abudali (阿布達里) Pass, not 60 li away from Hetu Ala, as his troops stretched themselves out to traverse the valley. His forces met Daišan&#x27;s assault and withstood the first charge, but was shattered in the second charge by Hong Taiji, whose banner inflicted heavy casualties as approximately 3,000 Zhejiang troops and more than 7,000 Hmong troops were killed. Liu Ting died in combat after personally killing several Jin soldiers.
The Joseon force of 10,000 musketeers and 3,000 archers were hindered by the harsh wind. Joseon archers fired volleys without arrowheads because they had not intended to fight the Jin in the first place and wished to maintain a neutral policy between the Later Jin and the Ming. The musketeers however performed admirably and fought until their allies surrendered. Their fortitude was regarded with admiration by the future Qing emperor Hong Taiji. Joseon contingent commander Gang Hong-rip then surrendered with his remaining troops.

=== Southern Route ===
Li Rubai received orders to retreat and withdrew his troop across Ming borders with minimal casualties, only losing a few hundred men in small Jin cavalry attacks. Ming officials claimed that Li Rubai&#x27;s personal relationship with Nurhaci (both having relations to Li Rubai&#x27;s father, Li Chengliang) was the reason he was not targeted and would later bring him to trial on this claim. He committed suicide before the trial.

==Aftermath==
Yang Hao was arrested by the Embroidered Uniform Guard and imprisoned for 10 years before he was executed by Zhu Youjian.

Li Rubai was impeached on the basis of his personal relationship with Nurhaci. He committed suicide before his trial.

Ma Lin retreated to Kaiyuan, where he was captured and killed by the Later Jin when they conquered the city a few months later.

After returning to Hetu Ala, Nurhaci celebrated with his retainers. Thereafter, he sent a messenger to the King of Joseon asking why they had aided the Ming and aired his grievances towards them. Not willing to anger Nurhaci, Joseon returned a letter congratulating him on his victory, but remained ambivalent in official communications with the Later Jin, nor did Joseon recognize his regime.

Two-thirds of the 13,000 Joseon Expeditionary Force were killed, but those who survived as captives were released and allowed to return to their homeland. Gang Hong-rip however was kept for his proficiency in the Jurchen language. Later on Gang would be led to believe that his family had died in the political turmoil that occurred during a coup in his native kingdom of Joseon. To exact his revenge on the Joseon court, he urged the Jin to invade Joseon, which led to the First Manchu invasion of Korea in 1627. Only during the peace negotiations did he find out that he had been misled.

The Joseon musketeers being overwhelmed by the Manchu cavalry prompted a revision of military tactics in Korea. In previous decades, the Imjin War was seen as a demonstration of the dominance of the firearm, and the Joseon adjusted military forces accordingly. Both sides of the war lacked effective shock cavalry to take advantage of the vulnerabilities of unsupported musketeers. After the defeat at Sarhū, the Joseon forces revised their doctrine to have spearmen supporting the musketeers. The new Korean force was tested against the Manchus again in 1627 and 1636-1637. Both times, they were defeated, but their performance left a strong impression on the Manchus. The first emperor of the newly declared Qing dynasty later wrote: &quot;The Koreans are incapable on horseback but do not transgress the principles of the military arts. They excel at infantry fighting.&quot;

<doc id="327389" wikidata="Q846870" url="?curid=327389" title="Prometheus Bound">
<text>Prometheus Bound () is an ancient Greek tragedy traditionally attributed to Aeschylus and thought to have been composed sometime between 479 BC and the terminus ante quem of 424 BC. The tragedy is based on the myth of Prometheus, a Titan who defies Zeus, and protects and gives fire to mankind, for which he is subjected to the wrath of Zeus and punished.

British-born author, C.J. Herington, a scholar of classical Greek and Latin, wrote that Aeschylus certainly did not mean &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; to be a &quot;self-contained dramatic unity&quot;, and suggests that &quot;most modern students of the subject would probably agree&quot; that &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; was followed by a work with the title &quot;Prometheus Lyomenos (Prometheus Unbound)&quot;. Herington adds that &quot;some very slight evidence&quot; indicates that &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; &quot;may have been followed by a third play&quot;, &quot;Prometheus Pyrphoros (Prometheus the Fire-Bearer)&quot;; the latter two survive only in fragments. Some scholars have proposed that these fragments all originated from &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, and that there were only two Promethean plays rather than three. Since the final two dramas of the trilogy have been lost, the author&#x27;s intention for the work as a whole is not known.

The ascription to Aeschylus had never been challenged since antiquity down to relatively recent times. By the 1970s, both R. P. Winnington-Ingram and Denys Page had become sceptical of its authenticity, but the majority of scholars still affirmed the traditional attribution of authorship. Independently in 1977 both Oliver Taplin and Mark Griffith made forceful cases, on linguistic, technical and stagecraft grounds, for questioning its authenticity, a view supported by M. L. West. To date, no consensus on the matter has been established, though recent computerized stylometric analysis has thrown the burden of proof on those who uphold the traditional claim.

==Synopsis==
Before the play begins, Kronos, the ruler of the pre-Olympian gods (the Titans), had been overthrown by an insurgency led by Zeus. In that revolt, Prometheus had sided with Zeus. As the new king, Zeus intended to destroy and replace humankind. Prometheus frustrated this plan, showing humans the use of fire, which Prometheus had stolen. Prometheus also taught humanity the arts. For these acts of defiance, Zeus intends to punish Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the mountains of Scythia.

The play opens with four characters on stage, a feature unique among the surviving corpus of Greek tragedy, in which a given scene rarely involved more than two actors besides the chorus. Kratos and Bia, personifications of brute power and callous violence respectively, are engaged in fettering the silent Prometheus to a mountainside in Scythia, and are assisted in the task by the begrudging blacksmith of the gods, Hephaestus. Zeus, an off-stage character in this play, is portrayed as a tyrannical leader.

Only one of Zeus&#x27;s two agents, Kratos, speaks in this scene, and he announces his orders harshly and insolently. Kratos states that the punishment meted out to Prometheus is due to the fact he stole fire and revealed the secret of how it is produced to humanity, adding that the punitive measure taken will compel Prometheus to take cognizance of the sovereignty of Zeus. For Prometheus, his punishment occurs because he dared to rescue mankind from being annihilated by Zeus. The penalty exacted is particularly galling since he himself had been instrumental in securing Zeus&#x27;s victory in the Titanomachy.

Hephaestus performs his task, shackling Prometheus to the mountain, whereupon all three exit, leaving Prometheus alone on stage. Prometheus now speaks, and appeals to the powers of Nature, which are all around him. He calls on the wind, the mountains&#x27; springs of water, the Earth and the Sun — to witness how he suffers unfairly. Somewhat elliptically he intuits what the future might portend in positive terms, and his outrage diminishes.

Prometheus becomes aware that something is approaching. He hears the beating of wings, and inhales the scent of the ocean. A chorus enters, made up of the daughters of Oceanus. From within their deep sea-caves, they had heard the sound of the hammering, and were drawn by curiosity and fear. They have arrived without stopping to put on their sandals. Before they come closer, they hover in the air just above Prometheus, who hints to them that he is keeping a secret that will eventually cause him to have power over Zeus. The chorus thinks that he is speaking out of anger, and may not actually be prophetic. Responding to their questions, Prometheus tells the story of his offense against Zeus admitting that it was deliberate. He complains that the punishment is too harsh. At last, Prometheus invites the chorus to stop hovering and come down to earth, to listen to more of what he has to say. They agree, and arrange themselves downstage in order to listen.

Prometheus&#x27; story is interrupted by the entrance of Oceanus — the father of the chorus of nymphs. Oceanus arrives in a carriage drawn by a winged beast — a griffin. Oceanus is an older god, a Titan son of Earth, who has made peace with Zeus. He has heard of Prometheus&#x27; troubles, and has come to offer some sympathy and advice. Prometheus is proud, and is hurt by this offer. Prometheus responds coldly, and wonders why Oceanus would leave his caves and streams to see such a miserable sight chained to a rock. Prometheus suggests that Oceanus should not intervene, out of concern for his own safety. Oceanus is annoyed by this, but wants to help, and offers to leave only when Prometheus tells him that if he attempts to intervene it will only increase the punishment Prometheus is suffering. Oceanus notes that his winged beast is eager to get home to his own stable, and he exits.

Prometheus is alone again with the chorus of Oceanus&#x27; daughters, who did not speak while their father was visiting. Prometheus speaks to the chorus of Ocean nymphs. He asks pardon for his silence, which is because he was thinking about the ingratitude of the gods. He describes the positive things he had done for humans. In the so-called Catalogue of the Arts (447-506), he reveals that he taught men all the civilizing arts, such as writing, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, metallurgy, architecture, and agriculture. He suggests that he will one day be unchained, but it will be due to the intervention of Necessity, which is something directed by Fate, not Zeus. When asked how that will happen, he keeps it secret. The Chorus sings an Ode that is a prayer that they will never cross Zeus.

Io, the daughter of Inachus, king of Argos, arrives. Io had become the object of Zeus&#x27;s affections and desires, which angered Zeus&#x27;s wife, Hera. Io&#x27;s father was advised to banish his daughter from his house, which he does. Io then wanders the Earth. Hera turned Io into a heifer and the herder Argus drove her from land to land. After Argus was killed by Hermes, a new torment was inflicted on Io — a plague of gad-flies. She has now arrived at the desolate place where Prometheus is chained. Prometheus is familiar with her story, and she recognizes him as the great friend to humans. The chorus doesn&#x27;t know Io&#x27;s past, and persuades Prometheus to let Io tell them. The chorus is shocked and saddened and asks Prometheus to tell of Io&#x27;s future wanderings. He hesitates because he knows it will be painful.

A brief dialogue reveals that Prometheus and Io are both victims of Zeus and that in the future Prometheus will eventually be freed by the descendants of Io. Prometheus asks Io to choose: Does she want to hear the rest of her own future, or the name of her descendant that will rescue him? The chorus interrupts — they want both: One answer for Io and one for themselves. Prometheus foresees that Io&#x27;s wanderings will end at the mouth of the Nile. There Zeus will restore her. She will give birth to a son, Epaphus, who will father fifty daughters, all of whom will murder their husbands, except for one, who will bear a line of kings, and another one who will rescue Prometheus from his torment. Prometheus&#x27; future rescuer is not named, but is known to be Heracles. Io bounds away.

Prometheus proclaims that no matter how great Zeus may be, his reign will eventually come to an end. Zeus may do his worst, but it will not be forever. The chorus express caution, which he responds to with even more defiance. Prometheus&#x27;s words have reached Zeus, whose messenger, Hermes, appears to urge Prometheus to reveal his secret about the marriage that threatens Zeus. Hermes reveals Zeus&#x27; own threats — the earthquake, the fall of the mountain that will bury Prometheus, the eagle that will attack Prometheus&#x27;s vital organs. Prometheus states again that he knows all that is to come and will endure it. Prometheus warns the chorus to stand aside. They don&#x27;t. The end comes: Earthquake, dust-storm, jagged lightning, whirlwind. As Zeus blasts Prometheus to Tartarus down in the bowels of the earth, Prometheus has the last line of the play: &quot;O holy mother mine, O you firmament that revolves the common light of all, you see the wrongs I suffer!&quot; Prometheus vanishes along with the chorus.

==Textual styles==
The play is composed of dialogues between the different characters, including, Io, Ocean, Nature, and with the chorus. The dialogue contains a sustained stichomythia between Prometheus and Oceanus, and also a unique series of quatrains sung by the chorus.

==Departures from Hesiod==
Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; and &quot;Theogony&quot;, written circa 700 BC, are early and major sources for stories of Greek mythology, and sources for Aeschylus. Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; contains the starting point for Aeschylus&#x27; play, which was written more than two centuries later. However by the time that Aeschylus read the &quot;Theogony&quot;, it had accrued significant additions that are now part of the extant version. Parts of those additions — including the story of Hercules killing the eagle — are essential to Aeschylus&#x27; conception of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. Aeschylus also added his own variations. For example, in Hesiod Prometheus&#x27; efforts to outwit Zeus are simply presented, without noting that Zeus&#x27; response is overly cruel, or that Prometheus&#x27; actions might be justified — that Zeus became angry was enough for Hesiod to report without question. Aeschylus looks at those events in Hesiod, and sees intolerable injustice.

Another departure by Aeschylus from Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; involves the two forms of punishment of Prometheus — the chaining to a rock, and the eagle&#x27;s daily tearing of his liver. In the version of the &quot;Theogony&quot; that Aeschylus was familiar with, which is also the extant version known to modern readers, the two punishments are presented as one story. It was Aeschylus, who instead decided to separate the tortures, and have the eagle begin tearing at Prometheus&#x27; liver only after the chained Prometheus had refused to reveal the secrets that Zeus wanted to know. Aeschylus&#x27; alterations have been maintained by literature that followed &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;.

Hesiod portrays Prometheus as a lowly trickster and semi-comic foil to Zeus&#x27;s authority. Zeus&#x27;s anger toward Prometheus is in turn responsible for mortal man&#x27;s having to provide for himself; before, all of man&#x27;s needs had been provided by the gods. Prometheus&#x27; theft of fire also prompts the arrival of the first woman, Pandora, and her jar of evils. Pandora is entirely absent from &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, where Prometheus becomes a human benefactor and divine kingmaker, rather than an object of blame for human suffering.

==Prometheus Trilogy==
There is evidence that &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; was the first play in a trilogy conventionally called the &quot;Prometheia&quot;, but the other two plays, &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; and &quot;Prometheus the Fire-Bringer&quot;, survive only in fragments. In &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat the Titan&#x27;s perpetually regenerating liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, we learn that Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned at the conclusion of the Titanomachy. In &quot;Prometheus the Fire-Bringer&quot;, the Titan finally warns Zeus not to lie with the sea nymph Thetis, for she is fated to give birth to a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus would later marry Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union will be Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. Grateful for the warning, Zeus finally reconciles with Prometheus.

==Questions regarding authorship==
Scholars of the Great Library of Alexandria considered Aeschylus to be the author of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. Since the 19th century, however, doubts began to emerge, after Rudolf Westphal, in 1857 and again in 1869, challenged the idea that the text was the work of a single author. In 1911, A. Gercke became the first scholar to reject the Aeschylean ascription, while dismissing the notion that a Prometheus trilogy itself existed. Two years later his student F. Niedzballa likewise concluded the text was written by someone else, on the basis of lexical analysis of words in the play not recurrent elsewhere in Aeschylus. Some have raised doubts focused on matters of linguistics, meter, vocabulary, and style, notably by Mark Griffith, though he remained open to idea that uncertainty persists and the traditional attribution might turn out to be correct. Griffith&#x27;s views were challenged in brief by Günther Zuntz and in great detail by Maria Pia Pattoni in 1987. M. L. West found the evidence against the ascription &#x27;overwhelming&#x27; and, after editing all seven plays, wrote an extended analysis and review of Griffith, Zuntz and Pattoni&#x27;s work concluding that ascription to Aeschylus was untenable and contextualizing the play as the product of the 440s-430s era.

Some scholars note that certain themes in the play appear to be foreign to Aeschylus, when compared to the themes in his other plays. The scholar Wilhelm Schmid argues that the playwright who demonstrated such piety toward Zeus in &quot;The Suppliants&quot; and &quot;Agamemnon&quot; could not have been the same playwright who in &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; inveighs against Zeus for violent tyranny. M. L. West argued that &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; may be the work of Aeschylus&#x27; son, Euphorion, who was also a playwright.

Responses to some of these questions have included the suggestion that the strongest characteristic of the play is in the humanity of their portrayal. The mythological and religious aspects are treated as secondary compared to the clash of wills that occurs between Zeus and Prometheus. The rebellion of Prometheus was not invented by Aeschylus, who only breathed the human spirit into older forms. This play, &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, only contains a part of the story. In the sequel, Aeschylus would have had the chance to give to Zeus&#x27; character an arc, and show him learning and developing more admirable and generous aspects. Coming later in the trilogy, a benevolent Zeus would have a deeper impact. In this play Zeus does not appear — we learn of the tyranny of Zeus, only from those who suffer from it. Characters&#x27; views need not be identical with the author’s.

==Dating the play==
A reference (lines 363-372) to the eruption of Mount Aetna in 479 suggests that &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; may date from later than this event. The play cannot date later than 430 BC, because &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; (part of the same trilogy as &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;) was parodied in Cratinus&#x27; &quot;Ploutoi&quot; (429 BC). &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; was then parodied in Cratinus&#x27; &quot;Seriphioi&quot; (c. 423) and Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Acharnians&quot; (425 BC).

==Reception and influence==
&quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; enjoyed a measure of popularity in antiquity. Aeschylus was very popular in Athens decades after his death, as Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Frogs&quot; (405 BC) makes clear. Allusions to the play are evident in his &quot;The Birds&quot; of 414 BC, and in the tragedian Euripides&#x27; fragmentary &quot;Andromeda&quot;, dated to 412 BC. If Aeschylean authorship is assumed, then these allusions several decades after the play&#x27;s first performance speak to the enduring popularity of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. Moreover, a performance of the play itself (rather than a depiction of the generic myth) appears on fragments of a Greek vase dated c. 370–360 BC.).

In the early 19th century, the Romantic writers came to identify with the defiant Prometheus. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote a poem on the theme, as did Lord Byron. Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a play, &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, which used some of the materials of the play as a vehicle for Shelley&#x27;s own vision.

==Performance in the English language==
In 1979 George Eugeniou directed and performed in the play at Theatro Technis London setting the drama in the Greece governed by the Junta. George Eugeniou, Koraltan Ahmet and Angelique Rockas played roles.

In 2005, &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; once again reached a London stage at The Sound Theatre in James Kerr&#x27;s new translation, also directed by Kerr and starring David Oyelowo as Prometheus.

A translation of the play by Joel Agee, commissioned by the J. Paul Getty Museum, the CalArts Center for New Performance, and Trans Arts, was first performed from 29 August to 28 September 2013 at the Getty Villa&#x27;s Outdoor Classical Theater. It was directed by Travis Preston, composed by Ellen Reid and Vinny Golia, and choreographed by Mira Kingsley. The production employed a huge, steel wheel in place of the barren cliff.

In April 2015 MacMillan Films, in the United States, staged &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; for camera using Peter Arnott&#x27;s translation with James Thomas directing, Tanya Rodina as Io, and Casey McIntyre as the Chorus Leader. The production used a real &quot;skene&quot; building whose roof was the landing and dance platform for the Chorus of Oceanids.

<text>Irene Wells Pennington (December 1898 – July 17, 2003) was the widow of Claude B. &quot;Doc&quot; Pennington, a wealthy oilman from Louisiana.

When he was well into his 90s and losing his touch mentally, she had him declared mentally incompetent and took charge of his fortune, estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; at $600 million.

She straightened out financial irregularities and replaced managers then and shortly after his death, before largely retiring herself.

This drew considerable attention, not only because of the substantial value of the fortune, but because of the fact of a senile nonagenarian&#x27;s affairs being taken over by someone actually slightly older than he.

The Pennington family still owns substantial land in southern Louisiana. The Pennington Biomedical Research Center was named for the family.

<text>Gyeongsang Province (; ) was one of the Eight Provinces of Joseon Korea. Gyeongsang was located in southeastern Korea.

The provincial capital of Gyeongsang was Daegu. The region was the birthplace of the kingdom of Silla, which unified Korea in 668 CE. The region also has a highly significant role in modern Korean history; every non-acting South Korean president from 1963 to 2022 except Choi Kyu-hah (1979-1980) had ancestry from Gyeongsang, and all except Lee Myung-bak were also born in Gyeongsang. 

Today, the historical region is divided into five administrative divisions: the three independent cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan, and the two provinces of North Gyeongsang Province and South Gyeongsang Province. The largest city in the historical region is Busan, followed by Daegu.

==History==
The predecessor to Gyeongsang Province was formed during the Goryeo (918-1392), replacing the former provinces of Yeongnam, Sannam and Yeongdong.

Gyeongsang acquired its current name in 1314. The name derives from names of the principal cities of Gyeongju and Sangju.

In 1895, Gyeongsang was replaced by the districts of Andong in the north, Daegu () in the centre, Jinju in the southwest, and Dongnae (; now Busan) in the southeast.

In 1896, Andong, Daegu, and northern Dongnae Districts were merged to form North Gyeongsang, and Jinju and southern Dongnae districts were merged to form South Gyeongsang. North and South Gyeongsang are part of South Korea today.

==Language==
The language used in Gyeongsang province (south and north) is the Yeongnam dialect of Korean, also called the Gyeongsang dialect, and the intonation and vocabulary is different from the standard Seoul dialect (표준어, &quot;pyojuneo&quot;) in several ways. Yeongnam dialect itself is further subdivided into several dialects. For example, Busan dialect is slightly different from Andong dialect and Uljin dialect.

==Geography==
Gyeongsang Province was bounded on the west by Jeolla and Chungcheong Provinces, on the north by Gangwon Province, on the south by Korea Strait, and on the east by the Sea of Japan. The region is ringed by the Taebaek and Sobaek Mountains and is drained by the Nakdong River.

The largest cities in the region are Busan, Daegu, and Ulsan. Other cities of note are Gyeongju (the former capital of Silla), Andong, Yeongju, Sangju, Gimcheon, Miryang, Gimhae, Changwon (the capital of South Gyeongsang), Masan, and Jinju.

The Gyeongsang region as a whole is often referred to by the regional and former provincial name of &quot;Yeongnam&quot; (The term &quot;Yeongdong&quot; is applied today to Gangwon Province).

<doc id="327393" wikidata="Q184625" url="?curid=327393" title="Decagon">
<text>In geometry, a decagon (from the Greek δέκα &quot;déka&quot; and γωνία &quot;gonía,&quot; &quot;ten angles&quot;) is a ten-sided polygon or 10-gon. The total sum of the interior angles of a simple decagon is 1440°.
==Regular decagon==
A &quot;regular decagon&quot; has all sides of equal length and each internal angle will always be equal to 144°. Its Schläfli symbol is {10} and can also be constructed as a truncated pentagon, t{5}, a quasiregular decagon alternating two types of edges.

=== Side length ===

The picture shows a regular decagon with side length formula_1 and radius formula_2 of the circumscribed circle.

* The triangle formula_3 has two equally long legs with length formula_2 and a base with length formula_1
* The circle around formula_6 with radius formula_1 intersects formula_8 in a point formula_9 (not designated in the picture).
* Now the triangle formula_10 is an isosceles triangle with vertex formula_6 and with base angles formula_12.
* Therefore formula_13. So formula_14 and hence formula_15 is also an isosceles triangle with vertex formula_9. The length of its legs is formula_1, so the length of formula_18 is formula_19.
* The isosceles triangles formula_20 and formula_21 have equal angles of 36° at the vertex, and so they are similar, hence: formula_22
* Multiplication with the denominators formula_23 leads to the quadratic equation: formula_24
* This equation for the side length formula_25 has one positive solution: formula_26
So the regular decagon can be constructed with &quot;ruler and compass&quot;.

;Further conclusions:
formula_27 and the base height of formula_28 (i.e. the length of formula_29) is formula_30 and the triangle has the area: formula_31.

===Area===
The area of a regular decagon of side length &quot;a&quot; is given by:
:formula_32

In terms of the apothem &quot;r&quot; (see also inscribed figure), the area is:
:formula_33

In terms of the circumradius &quot;R&quot;, the area is:
:formula_34

An alternative formula is formula_35 where &quot;d&quot; is the distance between parallel sides, or the height when the decagon stands on one side as base, or the diameter of the decagon&#x27;s inscribed circle.
By simple trigonometry,

:formula_36

and it can be written algebraically as

:formula_37

===Construction===
As 10 = 2 × 5, a power of two times a Fermat prime, it follows that a regular decagon is constructible using compass and straightedge, or by an edge-bisection of a regular pentagon.

An alternative (but similar) method is as follows:
#Construct a pentagon in a circle by one of the methods shown in constructing a pentagon.
#Extend a line from each vertex of the pentagon through the center of the circle to the opposite side of that same circle. Where each line cuts the circle is a vertex of the decagon.  In other words,  the image of a regular pentagon under a point reflection with respect of its center is a concentric &quot;congruent&quot; pentagon,  and the two pentagons have in total the vertices of a concentric &quot;regular decagon&quot;.
#The five corners of the pentagon constitute alternate corners of the decagon. Join these points to the adjacent new points to form the decagon.

== The golden ratio in decagon ==
Both in the construction with given circumcircle as well as with given side length is the golden ratio dividing a line segment by exterior division the
determining construction element.

* In the construction with given circumcircle the circular arc around G with radius produces the segment , whose division corresponds to the golden ratio.
:formula_38

* In the construction with given side length the circular arc around D with radius produces the segment , whose division corresponds to the golden ratio.
:formula_39


== Symmetry==
The &quot;regular decagon&quot; has Dih10 symmetry, order 20. There are 3 subgroup dihedral symmetries: Dih5, Dih2, and Dih1, and 4 cyclic group symmetries: Z10, Z5, Z2, and Z1.

These 8 symmetries can be seen in 10 distinct symmetries on the decagon, a larger number because the lines of reflections can either pass through vertices or edges. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r20 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g10 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.

The highest symmetry irregular decagons are d10, an isogonal decagon constructed by five mirrors which can alternate long and short edges, and p10, an isotoxal decagon, constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular decagon.

==Dissection==

Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2&quot;m&quot;-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into &quot;m&quot;(&quot;m&quot;-1)/2 parallelograms.
In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the &quot;regular decagon&quot;, &quot;m&quot;=5, and it can be divided into 10 rhombs, with examples shown below. This decomposition can be seen as 10 of 80 faces in a Petrie polygon projection plane of the 5-cube. A dissection is based on 10 of 30 faces of the rhombic triacontahedron. The list defines the number of solutions as 62, with 2 orientations for the first symmetric form, and 10 orientations for the other 6.

== Skew decagon==

A &quot;skew decagon&quot; is a skew polygon with 10 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such a decagon is not generally defined. A &quot;skew zig-zag decagon&quot; has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.

A &quot;regular skew decagon&quot; is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew decagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a pentagonal antiprism, pentagrammic antiprism, and pentagrammic crossed-antiprism with the same D5d, [2+,10] symmetry, order 20.

These can also be seen in these four convex polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry. The polygons on the perimeter of these projections are regular skew decagons.
===Petrie polygons===
The &quot;regular skew decagon&quot; is the Petrie polygon for many higher-dimensional polytopes, shown in these orthogonal projections in various Coxeter planes: The number of sides in the Petrie polygon is equal to the Coxeter number, &quot;h&quot;, for each symmetry family.

<text>Chungcheong Province (; ) was one of the eight provinces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Chungcheong was located in the southwest of Korea. The provincial capital was located at Gongju, which had been the capital of the kingdom of Baekje from 475 to 538.

==History==
Chungcheong Province was formed in 1356—during the Goryeo Dynasty—from the southern portion of the former province of Yanggwang. Its name derived from the names of the principal cities of Chungju (충주; 忠州) and Cheongju (청주; 淸州).

In 1895, the province was replaced by the Districts of Chungju (&quot;Chungju-bu;&quot; 충주부; 忠州府) in the east, Gongju (&quot;Gongju-bu;&quot; 공주부; 公州府) in the centre, and Hongju (&quot;Hongju-bu;&quot; 홍주부; 洪州府; modern-day Hongseong County) in the west.

In 1896, Chungju and eastern Gongju Districts were reorganized into North Chungcheong Province, and Hongju and western Gongju Districts were reorganized into South Chungcheong Province. North and South Chungcheong are today part of South Korea.

==Geography==
Historic Chungcheong was bordered on the north by Gyeonggi Province, on the north east by Gangwon, the east by Gyeongsang Provinces, on the south by North Jeolla Province, and on the west by the Yellow Sea. The region is mountainous in the east (the North province) and somewhat lower and flatter in the west (the South province).

The regional name for Chungcheong is &quot;Hoseo&quot; (호서; 湖西), although this name is used less than the current administrative name.

Apart from Cheongju, Chungju, and Gongju, other large or notable cities in the modern-day Chungcheong region include Daejeon, Cheonan and Janghang.

==Transportation and communication==
Historically, almost all transportation and communication routes between Seoul and the southern Honam (Jeolla) and Yeongnam (Gyeongsang) regions have gone through the Chungcheong region, and today Daejeon—the region&#x27;s largest city—is a major railway and freeway junction.

<text>The Tathāgatagarbha sūtras are a group of Mahayana sutras that present the concept of the &quot;womb&quot; or &quot;embryo&quot; (&quot;garbha&quot;) of the tathāgata, the buddha. Every sentient being has the possibility to attain Buddhahood because of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;.

This concept originated in India but was a major influence in the development of East Asian Buddhism, where it was equated with the concept of &quot;Buddhadhātu&quot;, &quot;buddha-element&quot; or &quot;buddha-nature&quot;.

The Tathāgatagarbha sūtras include the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot;. Related ideas are in found in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot;. Another major text, the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, was originally composed in China, while the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; was considerably extended in China .

Comparing the tradition of Tathāgatagarbha sūtras to the Yogachara and Madhyamaka schools, Paul Williams writes that this collection appears to have been less prominent in India, but became increasingly popular and significant in Central Asian Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism. 

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The Sanskrit term &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; () may be parsed into &quot;tathāgata&quot; &quot;the one thus gone&quot; (referring to Buddhahood) and &quot;garbha&quot; &quot;root, embryo, essence&quot;.

==Development of the concept==
===Luminous mind in the &quot;Nikāyas&quot;===
In the &quot;Anguttara Nikāya&quot;, the Buddha refers to a &quot;luminous mind&quot;.

The canon does not support the identification of the &quot;luminous mind&quot; with nirvanic consciousness, though it plays a role in the realization of nirvana. Upon the destruction of the fetters, according to one scholar, &quot;the shining nibbanic consciousness flashes out of the womb of arahantship, being without object or support, so transcending all limitations.&quot;

===Tathagatagarbha and Buddha-nature===
Though the tathagatagarbha and the Buddha-nature do not have exactly the same meaning, in the Buddhist tradition they became equated. In the &quot;Angulimaliya Sūtra&quot; and in the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; the terms &quot;Buddha-nature&quot; (&quot;Buddha-dhātu&quot;) and &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; are synonyms.

All are agreed that the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is an immortal, inherent transcendental essence or potency and that it resides in a concealed state (concealed by mental and behavioural negativities) in every single being, even the worst - the icchantika.

Although attempts are made in the Buddhist sutras to explain the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;, it remains ultimately mysterious and allegedly unfathomable to the ordinary, unawakened person, being only fully knowable by perfect Buddhas themselves.

The &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; itself needs no cultivation, only uncovering or discovery, as it is already present and perfect within each being:
Charles Muller comments that the tathagatagarbha is the mind&#x27;s original pure nature and has neither a point of origination nor a point of cessation: &quot;&#x27;tathagatagarbha&quot; expresses the already perfect aspect of the original nature of the mind that is clear and pure without arising or cessation.&#x27; 

The &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is the ultimate, pure, ungraspable, inconceivable, irreducible, unassailable, boundless, true and deathless quintessence of the Buddha&#x27;s emancipatory reality, the very core of his sublime nature.

==List of sutras==

=== According to modern scholarship ===
Michael Radich provides the following list of key Indian sutras associated with Tathāgatagarbha: 
* &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Buddha Womb Sutra&quot;, c. 200-250 CE)
* &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Lion&#x27;s Roar of Queen Srimala&quot;, 3rd century CE)
* &quot;Anūnatvāpurnatvanirdeśa (The Teaching on the Absence of Increase and Decrease)&quot;
* &quot;Mahābheri Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Great Dharma Drum Sutra&quot;) 
* &quot;Mahāmegha Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Great Cloud Sutra&quot;)
* &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra (Angulimala Sutra)&quot;
* &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Great Final Nirvana Sutra&quot;, c. 200 CE), very influential in Chinese Buddhism
* &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Descent into Lanka&quot; &quot;Sutra&quot;, 3rd century CE), integrating Tathāgatagarbha and Yogachara.

A similar and related sutra which synthesizes buddha-nature with Yogacara is the &quot;Ghanavyūha Sūtra&quot;.

== Overview of major sutras ==

===&quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; (200-250 CE)===

The &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; presents the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; as a virtual Buddha-homunculus, a fully wisdom-endowed Buddha, &quot;a most victorious body ... great and indestructible&quot;, inviolate, seated majestically in the lotus position within the body of each being, clearly visible only to a perfect Buddha with his supernatural vision. This is the most &quot;personalist&quot; depiction of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; encountered in any of the chief &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; sutras and is imagistically reminiscent of Mahāyāna descriptions of the Buddha himself sitting in the lotus posture within his own mother&#x27;s womb prior to birth: &quot;luminous, glorious, gracious, beautiful to see, seated with his legs crossed&quot; and shining &quot;like pure gold ...&quot;

===&quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; (2nd century CE)===

Some of the earliest and most important Tathāgatagarbha sūtras have been associated by scholars with certain early Buddhist schools in India.

Brian Edward Brown dates the composition of the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; to the Andhra Ikshvaku in the 3rd century CE, as a product of the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region. Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the Mahāsāṃghikas and the &quot;Śrīmālā&quot;, along with four major arguments for this association.

Sree Padma and Anthony Barber also associate the earlier development of the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; with the Mahāsāṃghikas, and conclude that the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region were responsible for the inception of the Tathāgatagarbha doctrine. 
According to the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot;, the tathāgatagarbha is &quot;not born, does not die, does not transfer, does not arise. It is beyond the sphere of the characteristics of the compounded; it is permanent, stable and changeless.&quot; Moreover, it has been described as &quot;the sphere of experience of the Tathāgatas [Buddhas].&quot;

===&quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; (c. 200 CE)===

The &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; is an eschatological text. Its core was written in India in a time which was perceived as the age in which the Buddha-dharma would perish, and all the Mahayana sutras disappear. The sutra responds to this awaited end with the proclamation of the tathagatagarbha, the innate Buddhahood present in all man.

According to Sallie B. King, the &quot;Mahaparinirvana Sutra&quot; does not represent a major innovation, and is rather unsystematic, which made it &quot;a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text&quot;. According to King, its most important innovation is the linking of the term &quot;buddhadhātu&quot; with &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;. 

&quot;Buddhadhātu&quot;, &quot;Buddha-nature&quot;, &quot;the nature of the Buddha&quot;, that what constitutes a Buddha, is a central topic of the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot;. According to Sally King, the sutra speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text. The &quot;nature of the Buddha&quot; is presented as a timeless, eternal &quot;Self&quot;, which is akin to the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;, the innate possibility in every sentient being to attain Buddhahood and manifest this timeless Buddha-nature. This &quot;hidden treasury&quot; is present in all sentient beings:
This does not mean that sentient beings are at present endowed with the qualities of a Buddha, but that they will have those qualities in the future. It is obscured from worldly vision by the screening effect of kleshas, tenacious negative mental afflictions. The most notable of which are greed, hatred, delusion, and pride. Once these negative mental states have been eliminated, however, the buddhadhātu is said to shine forth unimpededly and the buddhadhātu can then be consciously &quot;entered into&quot;, and therewith deathless Nirvana attained:
===&quot;Anunatva Apurnatva Nirdeśa&quot;===

The development of the Buddha-nature doctrine is closely related to that of Buddha-matrix (Sanskrit: &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;). In the &quot;Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa&quot;, the Buddha links the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; to the &quot;Dharmadhātu&quot; (ultimate, all-equal, uncreated essence of all phenomena) and to essential being, stating: &quot;What I call &quot;be-ing&quot; (&quot;sattva&quot;) is just a different name for this permanent, stable, pure and unchanging refuge that is free from arising and cessation, the inconceivable pure Dharmadhatu.&quot;

===&quot;Angulimaliya Sūtra&quot;===

Every being has Buddha-nature (&quot;Buddha-dhatu&quot;). It is indicated in the &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot; that if the Buddhas themselves were to try to find any sentient being who lacked the Buddha-nature, they would fail. In fact, it is stated in this sutra that the Buddhas do discern the presence of the everlasting Buddha-nature in every being:

Belief and faith in the true reality of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is presented by the relevant scriptures as a positive mental act and is strongly urged; indeed, rejection of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is linked with highly adverse karmic consequences. In the &quot;Angulimaliya Sutra&quot; it is stated that teaching only non-self and dismissing the reality of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; karmically lead one into most unpleasant rebirths, whereas spreading the doctrine of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; will bring benefit both to oneself and to the world. 

===&quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; (3rd century CE)===

The later &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; presents the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; as being a teaching completely consistent with and identical to emptiness. It synthesizes &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; with the emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;) of the &quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot; sutras. Emptiness is the thought-transcending realm of non-duality and unconditionedness: complete freedom from all constriction and limitation.

The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; describes the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; as &quot;by nature brightly shining and pure,&quot; and &quot;originally pure,&quot; though &quot;enveloped in the garments of the &quot;skandhas&quot;, &quot;dhātus&quot; and &quot;ayatanas&quot; and soiled with the dirt of attachment, hatred, delusion and false imagining.&quot; It is said to be &quot;naturally pure,&quot; but it appears impure as it is stained by adventitious defilements. Thus the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; identifies the luminous mind of the canon with the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;.

It also equates the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (and &quot;ālaya-vijñāna&quot;) with nirvana, though this is concerned with the actual attainment of nirvana as opposed to nirvana as a timeless phenomenon. 

In the later &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; it is said that the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; might be mistaken for a self, which it is not. In fact, the sutra states that it is identical to the teaching of no-self.

In Section XXVIII of the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, Mahāmati asks Buddha, &quot;Is not this Tathagata-garbha taught by the Blessed One the same as the ego-substance taught by the philosophers?&quot; The Buddha&#x27;s response:
Yet in the concluding &quot;Sagathakam&quot; portion of the text, coming after the above-quoted passage, the sutra does not deny the reality of the Self; in fact it castigates such denial of the &#x27;pure Self&#x27;. According to Thomas Cleary, &quot;The original scripture rigorously rejects nihilism and does not ultimately deny either self or world&quot;, and quotes the sutra: 
&quot;Confused thinkers without guidance are in a cave of consciousness running hither and thither seeking to explain the self. The pure self has to be realized first hand; that is the matrix of realization [Tathagatagarbha], inaccessible to speculative thinkers.&quot; 

The &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; doctrine became linked (in syncretic form) with doctrines of Citta-mātra (&quot;just-the-mind&quot;) or Yogācāra. Yogācārins aimed to account for the possibility of the attainment of Buddhahood by ignorant sentient beings: the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is the indwelling awakening of bodhi in the very heart of samsara. There is also a tendency in the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; sutras to support vegetarianism, as all persons and creatures are compassionately viewed as possessing one and the same essential nature - the &quot;Buddha-dhatu&quot; or Buddha-nature.

== Treatises based on the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras ==
There are two very influential treatises (shastras) on buddha-nature which draw on and systematize the Tathāgatagarbha sutra material: 

* &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;, which is very influential in Tibetan Buddhism and was translated into Chinese as well.
* &quot;Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana&quot; (Chinese: 大乘起信論; pinyin: &quot;Dàshéng Qǐxìn Lùn&quot;), which is very important in East Asian Buddhism but not studied in Tibetan Buddhism.

Furthermore, there are three other Indian buddha-nature treatises preserved only in Chinese:

* &quot;Dharmadhātvaviśeṣaśāstra&quot; (Ch: &quot;Dasheng fajie wuchabie lun,&quot; 大乘法界無差別論), attributed to Saramati (the same author to which the Chinese tradition attributes the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;).
* &quot;Buddhagotraśāstra&quot; (佛性論, &quot;Fó xìng lùn, Buddha-nature treatise&quot;, Taishō no. 1610), said to have been translated by Paramartha and is attributed by Chinese tradition to Vasubandhu.
* &quot;Anuttarâśrayasūtra&quot;, which according to Takasaki &quot;is clearly a composition based upon the &quot;Ratna-&quot;[&quot;gotravibhāga&quot;].&quot;

=== &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; ===
Of disputed authorship, the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (otherwise known as the &quot;Mahāyānottaratantraśāstra&quot; or just &quot;Uttaratantra&quot; - &quot;The Supreme Continuum&quot;), is the only Indian attempt to create a coherent philosophical model based on the ideas found in the Tathāgatagarbha Sutras. The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; especially draws on the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot;. Despite East Asian Buddhism&#x27;s propensity for the concepts found in the Tathāgatagarbha Sutras, the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; has played a relatively small role in East Asian Buddhism. This is due to the primacy of sutra study and the centrality of the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; in East Asian Buddhism.

The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; sees the Buddha-nature (&quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;) as &quot;suchness&quot; or &quot;thusness&quot; - the abiding reality of all things - in a state of tarnished concealment within the being. The idea is that the ultimate consciousness of each being is spotless and pure, but surrounded by negative tendencies which are impure. Paul Williams comments on how the impurity is actually not truly part of the Buddha-nature, but merely conceals the immanent true qualities of Buddha mind (i.e. the buddha-nature) from manifesting openly:

<text>Bertie Charles Forbes (; May 14, 1880 – May 6, 1954) was a Scottish-American financial journalist and author who founded &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

==Early life and education==
Forbes was born in New Deer, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the son of Agnes (Moir) and Robert Forbes, a storekeeper and tailor at Whitehill, one of their ten children. Forbes attended University College, Dundee, which was then part of the University of St Andrews.

==Career==
In 1897, Forbes worked as a reporter and editorial writer with a local newspaper. In 1901, when he moved to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he worked on the &quot;Rand Daily Mail&quot; under its first editor, Edgar Wallace. 

In 1904, he emigrated to New York City where he was employed as a writer and financial editor at the &quot;Journal of Commerce&quot; before joining the Hearst chain of newspapers as a syndicated columnist in 1911. After two years, he became the business and financial editor at Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York American&quot;, where he remained until 1916.

He founded &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 1917 and remained the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief until his death in New York City in 1954, though he was assisted in his later years by his two eldest sons, Bruce Charles Forbes and Malcolm Stevenson Forbes.

Forbes was the founder of the Investors League in 1942.

==Death==
He died on May 6, 1954. In 1988, his body was returned to his native Scotland, and lies buried in the New Deer Churchyard at Hill of Culsh in New Deer, Aberdeenshire. While living abroad, he returned to Buchan every two years, staying in the Cruden Bay Hotel, &quot;to entertain people of Whitehill to a picnic&quot;. It was a tradition revived by his son, Malcolm, in 1987.
