<text>Cherry picking, suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related and similar cases or data that may contradict that position. Cherry picking may be committed intentionally or unintentionally.

The term is based on the perceived process of harvesting fruit, such as cherries. The picker would be expected to select only the ripest and healthiest fruits. An observer who sees only the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most, or even all, of the tree&#x27;s fruit is in a likewise good condition. This can also give a false impression of the quality of the fruit (since it is only a sample and is not a representative sample). A concept sometimes confused with cherry picking is the idea of gathering only the fruit that is easy to harvest, while ignoring other fruit that is higher up on the tree and thus more difficult to obtain (see low-hanging fruit).

Cherry picking has a negative connotation as the practice neglects, overlooks or directly suppresses evidence that could lead to a complete picture. 

Cherry picking can be found in many logical fallacies. For example, the &quot;fallacy of anecdotal evidence&quot; tends to overlook large amounts of data in favor of that known personally, &quot;selective use of evidence&quot; rejects material unfavorable to an argument, while a false dichotomy picks only two options when more are available. Some scholars classify cherry-picking as a fallacy of selective attention, the most common example of which is the confirmation bias. Cherry picking can refer to the selection of data or data sets so a study or survey will give desired, predictable results which may be misleading or even completely contrary to reality.

==History==

A story about the 5th century BCE atheist philosopher Diagoras of Melos says how, when shown the votive gifts of people who had supposedly escaped death by shipwreck by praying to gods, he pointed out that many people &quot;had&quot; died at sea in spite of their prayers, yet these cases were not likewise commemorated (this is an example of survivorship bias). Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) in his essay on prophecies comments on people willing to believe in the validity of supposed seers: 
==In science==
Cherry picking is one of the epistemological characteristics of denialism and widely used by different science denialists to seemingly contradict scientific findings. For example, it is used in climate change denial, evolution denial by creationists, denial of the negative health effects of consuming tobacco products and passive smoking.

==In medicine==
In a 2002 study, a review of previous medical data found cherry picking in tests of anti-depression medication:

[researchers] reviewed 31 antidepressant efficacy trials to identify the primary exclusion criteria used in determining eligibility for participation. Their findings suggest that patients in current antidepressant trials represent only a minority of patients treated in routine clinical practice for depression. Excluding potential clinical trial subjects with certain profiles means that the ability to generalize the results of antidepressant efficacy trials lacks empirical support, according to the authors.

==In argumentation==
In argumentation, the practice of &quot;quote mining&quot; is a form of cherry picking, in which the debater selectively picks some quotes supporting a position (or exaggerating an opposing position) while ignoring those that moderate the original quote or put it into a different context. Cherry picking in debates is a large problem as the facts themselves are true but need to be put in context. Because research cannot be done live and is often untimely, cherry-picked facts or quotes usually stick in the public mainstream and, even when corrected, lead to widespread misrepresentation of groups targeted.

==One-sided argument==
A one-sided argument (also known as card stacking, stacking the deck, ignoring the counterevidence, slanting, and suppressed evidence) is an informal fallacy that occurs when only the reasons supporting a proposition are supplied, while all reasons opposing it are omitted.

Philosophy professor Peter Suber has written:The one-sidedness fallacy does not make an argument invalid. It may not even make the argument unsound. The fallacy consists in persuading readers, and perhaps ourselves, that we have said enough to tilt the scale of evidence and therefore enough to justify a judgment. If we have been one-sided, though, then we haven&#x27;t yet said enough to justify a judgment. The arguments on the other side may be stronger than our own. We won&#x27;t know until we examine them. 

So the one-sidedness fallacy doesn&#x27;t mean that your premises are false or irrelevant, only that they are incomplete.

[…] You might think that one-sidedness is actually desirable when your goal is winning rather than discovering a complex and nuanced truth. If this is true, then it&#x27;s true of every fallacy. If winning is persuading a decision-maker, then any kind of manipulation or deception that actually works is desirable. But in fact, while winning may sometimes be served by one-sidedness, it is usually better served by two-sidedness. If your argument (say) in court is one-sided, then you are likely to be surprised by a strong counter-argument for which you are unprepared. The lesson is to cultivate two-sidedness in your thinking about any issue. Beware of any job that requires you to truncate your own understanding.

Card stacking is a propaganda technique that seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another. Such emphasis may be achieved through media bias or the use of one-sided testimonials, or by simply censoring the voices of critics. The technique is commonly used in persuasive speeches by political candidates to discredit their opponents and to make themselves seem more worthy.

The term originates from the magician&#x27;s gimmick of &quot;stacking the deck&quot;, which involves presenting a deck of cards that appears to have been randomly shuffled but which is, in fact, &#x27;stacked&#x27; in a specific order. The magician knows the order and is able to control the outcome of the trick. In poker, cards can be stacked so that certain hands are dealt to certain players.

The phenomenon can be applied to any subject and has wide applications. Whenever a broad spectrum of information exists, appearances can be rigged by highlighting some facts and ignoring others. Card stacking can be a tool of advocacy groups or of those groups with specific agendas. For example, an enlistment poster might focus upon an impressive picture, with words such as &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;adventure&quot;, while placing the words, &quot;enlist for two to four years&quot; at the bottom in a smaller and less noticeable point size.

<text>The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (in Spanish: Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, URNG-MAIZ or most commonly URNG) is a Guatemalan political party that started as a guerrilla movement in 1982. The party laid down its arms in 1996 and became a legal political party in 1998, after the peace process which ended the Guatemalan Civil War.

==History==

===Background===
====&quot;PBSUCCESS&quot; and early insurgency====
Since the CIA-backed coup in 1954, opposition groups were continuously forming in an attempt to fight against the repression that the military and wealthy landowners in Guatemala had created. The ensuing military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas immediately on 28 June 1954 banned the Guatemalan Party of Labour (PGT) and shortly later other labor unions and left-wing parties with suspected communist sympathies via Decree 4880. After the assassination of Castillo Armas by a left-wing member of the presidential guard, Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes prevailed in the ensuing power struggle. The continued repression, coupled with an ever closer alignment of the Guatemalan government with the United States government, as well as rampant corruption and favoritism led to a rebellion by a group of dissident officers, which later named themselves Revolutionary Movement 13th November (MR-13), in reference to the incident. The failed coup d&#x27;état on 13 November 1960 usually marks the beginning of the Guatemalan Civil War, a bloody affair that lasted 36 years and claimed the lives of an estimated 200,000 people. With United States military assistance, the guerrilla were uprooted from eastern Guatemala and had to flee to neighboring Honduras. Remnants of the MR-13 returned in 1962 and established the first guerrilla group, the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR). After barely any preparation the FAR launched its first attacks against remote military installations and properties of the United Fruit Company on 6 February 1962. The failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961 and his purported erratic behavior convinced part of the military and the United States to rid themselves of Ydígoras Fuentes, which finally succeeded after several attempts in March 1963. This putsch, led by his Minister of Defense Alfredo Enrique Peralta Azurdia, denoted the beginning of Guatemala&#x27;s first authentic military regime. In 1966, the law professor Julio César Méndez Montenegro was elected to the presidency, but was only allowed to take up the position under the condition, that he would not interfere in matters of internal security or the military. The year also saw the creation of Mano Blanca, a right-wing paramilitary group associated with the MLN, founded to prohibit Méndez Montenegro from taking office and to counter left-wing activism. The subsequent &quot;white terror&quot; coupled with the Zacapa program, severely crippled the guerrilla force based in eastern Guatemala, which in turn tried to avoid detection by hiding in cities. The FAR responded by resorting to various assassinations and abductions during the late 1960s to early 1970s, like those of John Gordon Mein and Karl von Spreti. The tense security situation led both right-wing military factions, namely the MLN and PID to unify for the elections in 1970, to counter the reforms initiated under Méndez Montenegro, which the army perceived as infringing on their autonomy. The incoming government of Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio initiated another counterinsurgency to stifle the FAR and began to entrench the military in the Guatemalan economy, chiefly by establishing the Army Bank, which handed out loans to the officer corps.
====FAR splinters and government pressure====
As a consequence of the repression, a large contingent of the FAR came to the conclusion that they needed to change their strategy. Instead of continuing with the foco strategy of confronting the army in the countryside, which inflicted heavy losses on them, they saw the need to expand their social base to indigenous communities and middle class intellectuals and professionals. This perception gave rise to the Organization of People in Arms (ORPA) and Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) in the early 1970s. The former was formed in 1971 as the &quot;Organización Regional de Occidente&quot;, as a branch of the FAR in western Guatemala, before splitting outright in mid 1972. The split was effectuated by their differences regarding organizational and ideological questions, particularly the role of ethnicity in the economic exclusion of indigenous people. The group underwent a gestation period of 8 years, operating clandestinely, mainly recruiting soldiers and accruing arms, before committing their first operation in September 1979. The group would soon grow famous for acts of armed propaganda in this mold, wherein they disarmed the local police and military forces and read out revolutionary statements, while handing out propaganda leaflets. Similarly the Guerrilla Army of the Poor was established in 1972, as a splinter of the FAR, caused by ideological and tactical differences akin to ORPA, in that they saw the greatest revolutionary potential in indigenous people. This group was heavily influenced by liberation theology and build a large indigenous and Ladino following in El Quiché. In the midst of this situation the MLN-PID alliance broke down and the protégé of Arana Osorio, Fernando Romeo Lucas García of the PID was elected to the presidency. Lucas García tried to solidify his hold on power by integrating the Mano Blanca into the regular military, while establishing the Ejercito Secreto Anti-Comunista, a paramilitary group beholden to himself. This group committed various human rights abuses, among them torture, public threats to prominent political adversaries and massacres, like the infamous Panzós massacre. In response to these massacres, sections of the FAR and a PGT splinter group also rejoined the armed struggle by the late 1970s, creating a volatile atmosphere in Guatemala.

====Guerrilla offensive and pre-unification measures====
The repression of the late 1970s failed to quell the rebellion and likely had the unintentional consequence of growing the ranks of the guerrilla factions between 1980 and 1981, who by that time were in charge of 9 departments in Guatemala. Another pivotal incident was the Spanish Embassy Fire in January 1980, in which the Guatemalan military firebombed the embassy to evict a protest group of indigenous peasant farmers and student activist inside the embassy, which also backfired at the military, leading to even more momentum for the guerrilla mobilization effort. By early 1981, the guerrilla forces were so strong that they mounted a major offensive on government forces, leaving rural areas in the West and South firmly in their hands and enabling them to mount occasional assaults in the capital. The military responded with a widespread counter-insurgency campaign, linked with a divide and conquer strategy, by organizing the recruitment of indigenous people into, so-called &quot;self-defense patrols&quot; (&quot;Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil&quot; (PAC)), to control their communities. The increasing oppression brought the divided groups back together, which had in 1978 already established a Tripartite cooperation agreement between EGP, FAR and PGT-ND. Geopolitical circumstances at the end of 1980 led the Cuban and Nicaraguan government, which supported the guerrilla, to ultimately press for a more thorough merger.

===Formation===
In the backdrop of these civil war circumstances the URNG formed as a leftist umbrella organization consisting of four groups: the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP), the Revolutionary Organization of People in Arms (ORPA), the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) and the National Directing Nucleus of PGT (PGT-NDN) on 8 February 1982. The unification process was mediated by the Cuban government, who only wanted to support a unitary and forceful insurgency. In consequence, the group became the public face of the long-running insurgency against the Guatemalan government throughout the Guatemalan Civil War.

Later on, the URNG led the leftist opposition in peace negotiations with the conservative Guatemalan government. These negotiations began in 1986 and brought the end of the civil war when negotiations finished in December 1996, by signing the Firm and Lasting Agreement. The conclusion of the peace talks led the URNG to pursue the registration as a legal party inside the Guatemalan political system in June 1997. The group was formally registered as a political party in December 1998.

===Civil war era===
====Military regimes and suppression of the guerrilla====
In March 1982, only one month after their formation, the URNG experienced an attack ordered by then president, retired General Efraín Ríos Montt. Backed by the CIA, Ríos Montt led a &quot;scorched-earth&quot; counter-insurgency campaign against the URNG and its supporters until he was toppled the following year.
During his rule, Rios Montt tried to eradicate the insurgency by banning the activities of political parties and committing various massacres against the population in the Guatemalan highlands, thereby removing the recruitment pool of the URNG. He and his associates ascribed critique on their measures to an &quot;international communist conspiracy&quot; of which Amnesty International and the Catholic Church were also a part of. Ríos Montt&#x27;s eventual downfall from power followed a similar path as his ascension, with a coup by his Minister of Defence Óscar Humberto Mejía Víctores in August 1983. His overthrow ended the bloodiest episode of the civil war and the Guatemalan genocide, in which approximately 150,000 civilians were killed between mid 1981 and 1983 and which led to widespread displacement of another 1.5 million people. The &quot;Victoria 82&quot; campaign, as it was called by Ríos Montt, proved to be highly successful against the guerrilla though, which had to retreat to remote rural zones, while its leadership fled to Mexico City. It also hampered the merging process of the divergent groups considerably, as streamlined and unified logistics could only be arranged by 1986. Additionally devastating for the guerrilla was the renewed support from the USA to the Guatemalan military upon the Reagan administration taking office in January 1981.

The militant PGT splinter groups saw their base wiped-out, following the capture and coerced conversion of Carlos Quinteros, an important commander in their ranks. The political wing of the PGT also faced a major crisis, after unsuccessfully trying to reorganize itself in its former northern strongholds of Alta Verapaz, as this plan was thwarted by the military. The social disarticulation and continuous assassinations of its members eventually led to its exhaustion by 1986, which prompted them to mend their relationship with the URNG. These events led the URNG to eventually substitute the PGT-NDN for the PGT in its leadership by 1987.

The URNG employed ambushes and raids on government security forces as their main tactic, and also performed bombings and assassinations. They attacked the military, government officials, as well as foreign diplomats and foreign businesses. The government responded with undercover death-squads, supported by the police and military, who undertook the mission to take down prominent leftists.

====Return to civilian rule====
After the election of Vinicio Cerezo in 1985, the truncated civil society in Guatemala revitalized to some degree, which convinced a significant part of mid-level cadres to abandon armed struggle, subsequently reducing the organisations leverage during the peace negotiations. Already during his election campaign, Vinicio Cerezo emphasized national unity, which he combined with critique of the armies conduct and expressed willingness to negotiate with the URNG. Still his presidency achieved very little to rein in on political violence and he made only token efforts to prosecute human rights abuses committed by the army. According to the FAR commander Pablo Monsanto, the guerilla entered the first negotiations with the Cerezo administration to reorganize and rearm itself and only later reached a point, where a political solution to the conflict seemed beneficial and unavoidable.
By the time a civilian government returned to office in 1986, the URNG recognized that coming to power through armed struggle was out of the question, and they took initiatives to negotiate a political solution.

According to a report in NACLA&#x27;s &quot;Report on the Americas&quot; (May/June 1997),

The government and army maintained that since they had &quot;defeated&quot; the URNG, they had no need to negotiate until the guerrillas had laid down their arms. The subsequent settlements ending the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador stiffened the elites&#x27; resolve &quot;never&quot; to permit such an outcome in Guatemala.

The URNG functioned as an umbrella organization to represent the leftist beliefs amongst the Guatemalan people, particularly the Guatemalan poor. Although they were involved in attacks, their primary function was at the negotiation table with the Guatemalan government.

===Peace process===
From 1986 to 1996, the army and government were drawn into a peace process moderated and verified by the United Nations and including other international actors as key players. During the negotiations both sides made major concessions. The UN mediated Oslo Agreement provided an arrangement for direct negotiation between the belligerent groups. This open negotiation led to the signing of the &quot;Agreement on Procedures in Search of Peace by Political Means&quot; in Mexico in 1991. The United Nations presided over these changes meant to create a long-lasting peace. Obligations were imposed on the government, including significant constitutional reforms, which were internationally binding and would be verified by the UN. After 9 years of negotiations in 1995, the leadership of the URNG came to a preliminary agreement with the government to sign a peace deal in 1996.

===Peace accord and legal opposition party===
On 29 December 1996, a peace agreement was signed by the government and the URNG in the presence of UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, officially ending the 36-year civil war. The signing ceremony was held in front of the National Palace of Culture on the Plaza de la Constición in the presence of about 50,000 people. Among a cheerful crowd, a flame of peace was lit by the signatories inmidst the place to symbolize the end of armed conflict. The Secretary-General of the URNG, Comandante Rolando Morán and president Álvaro Arzú jointly received the UNESCO Peace Prize for their efforts to end the civil war and attain the peace agreement.

The UNRG has since apologized for the atrocities that occurred during the Guatemalan Civil War, asking forgiveness from all victims, families and other who experienced any kind of excesses. This apology came two days after President Clinton admitted the role of the United States in a &quot;dark and painful period&quot; during the civil war in Guatemala. After Rolando Moran died in September 1998, Pablo Monsanto (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; Jorge Soto) was elected to succeed him as Secretary General of the party. In May 1999, as a provision of the peace agreement, a constitutional referendum was held to amend the constitution. The URNG was part of the Front for Yes, advocating for an affirmative vote during the election campaign. All 4 provisions failed to win a majority, albeit amid a low voter turnout of 18.5%.

The party made its national electoral debut during the elections in 1999, joining forces with 2 minor left-wing parties, the Authentic Integral Development and &quot;Unidad de la Izquierda Democrática&quot; to contest the elections as the New Nation Alliance. The alliance, which was finalized on 12 February 1999, nominated the moderate Álvaro Colom, who in 2011 eventually was successful in seeking the presidential office inside the National Unity of Hope, as their presidential candidate. He came in third with about 12.4% of the vote. The alliance also achieved the third place in the legislative election with 11% of the national vote, thereby electing 9 Congress members. The party drew significant support from part of their former strongholds and majority indigenous departments Huehuetenango, Quetzaltenango and El Quiché, where in each the alliance was able to win an electoral district seat.

In August 2001, with the support of Rodrigo Asturias (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; Gaspar Ilom)), Alba Estela Maldonado Guevara (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; Capitán Lola) was elected to replace Soto as Secretary General and subsequently developed a cosier relationship with the ruling FRG, which was founded by its former archenemy Rios Montt. The new party line was met with significant opposition from within the party, leading first to the resignation of Arnoldo Noriega, a former leader inside the EGP and critique from Soto, who rejected cooperation with the FRG. Later in May 2002, Soto also left the party to found the New Nation Alternative, taking fewer than 200 members with him.

In the legislative election, held on 9 November 2003, the severely fractured party saw their vote share decrease to 4.2% of the popular vote, returning 2 out of 158 seats to Congress. Elected were Maldonado Guevara via the party list and Viktor Manuel Sales for a seat in the Huehuetenango delegation. In the presidential election held the same day, its candidate Rodrigo Asturias won 2.6% of the popular vote.

After the elections party leaders cited, among other factors, their lack of knowledge about the political system and electoral campaigning as reasons for their limited electoral success. After Rodrigo Asturias passed away in June 2005, Héctor Nuila was selected to succeed him as Secretary General. In the preparation phase for the next election, &quot;Movimiento Amplio de Izquierdas&quot; (MAIZ) was founded as a leftist platform, representing various leftist organizations.

At the 2007 elections the party captured 2 seats, one in Huehuetenango and one via the national list, with 3.7% of the nationwide vote in the congressional elections. In the presidential election of the same day, its candidate Miguel Ángel Sandoval won 2.1% of the popular vote.

For the elections in 2011 the party entered into a political alliance with Winaq, MNR, the URNG splinter ANN and 60 civil society groups to form the Broad Front of the Left. Broadly seen as a positive development inside the left, the coalition only yielded limited electoral success, returning only two seats, one each for San Marcos and Huehuetenango, to the legislature with approximately 3.3% in the congressional elections and 3.2% for the presidential candidate and Winaq founder Rigoberta Menchú.

At the national party convention in March 2013, a new executive committee was elected, including Ángel Sánchez as the successor of Héctor Nuila as new General Secretary.

The coalition was maintained for the 2015 elections and was able to increase their vote share to almost 4.4%, but the party only maintained their single legislator in Congress via winning a congressional district. In the presidential elections the Broad Front of the Left unified behind the presidential candidacy of Miguel Ángel Sandoval, who received about 2.1% of the vote.

In January 2019, the possibility of a united list with the successor party of the ANN, Convergence was explored.
In May 2019, in the run-up to the next elections, the party was one of 5 left leaning parties that declined to participate in a conference hosted by the Asociación la Familia Importa for a conservative pact concerning the &quot;defense of family and life&quot;.

The coalition split up ahead of the elections in 2019, but the party was nonetheless able to reach 2.8% among the national electorate and even increased their number of elected deputies to 3. Before the start of the election campaign, the party committee held talks with Thelma Aldana, founder of Semilla, to discuss the possible support of her candidacy, but as she was barred from participating in the election by the Constitutional Court due to questionable accusations of corruption, the party ultimately nominated Pablo Ceto and Blanca Estela Colop. Ceto, who had already been a vice presidential candidate for the party in 2003, campaigned on a reinvigorated peace process as well as the eradication of poverty and roughly maintained their last result with 2.2% of the vote.

The party by and large opposed the government of Alejandro Giammattei after the election and particularly opposed the dismissal of Juan Francisco Sandoval as head prosecutor of the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s Office against Impunity in July 2021.
In January 2022, Miguel Ángel Sandoval, the former presidential candidate for the party or alliance in 2007 and 2015, wrote an open letter to party leadership of his own party, the Movement for the Liberation of Peoples, Semilla and Winaq, calling for a fresh political and electoral alliance. He cited the Historic Pact for Colombia and the Brazil of Hope coalitions as successful role models for cross ideological alliances. On 29 January 2023, URNG and Winaq made their renewed alliance public and announced their plans to nominate Amílcar Pop and Mónica Enríquez as their presidential ticket for the upcoming elections.
Moreover, the parties aimed to cooperate with Semilla to win the mayorship of Guatemala City, which ultimately came to fruition when the coalition nominated Juan Francisco Solórzano Foppa, the former director of the Superintendency of the Tax Administration (SAT), for the position.

== Support base ==
During the civil war the group received support from Guatemala&#x27;s rural poor as well as from urban intellectuals. The URNG enjoyed high support among indigenous communities, which was reflected in the fact that 82% of its demobilized armed combatants and 50% of its political activists came from an indigenous background. After the conclusion of peace negotiations, the URNG was only partially able to maintain this constituency, as other sections organized inside the Democratic Front New Guatemala.

The party is closely affiliated with the farmers&#x27; association Committee for Peasant Unity (CUC) since the civil war era. The union was officially founded on 15 April 1978 to organize peasant farmers and improve their economic conditions. Some of its members later rose to prominent roles inside the URNG, like Secretary General Gregorio Chay and Pablo Ceto, the presidential candidate for the party in 2019.

In contrast to many other parties in Guatemala, the party has a widespread and permanent organizational structure in place.

==Party platform and ideology==
A study from FLASCO Guatemala, released in 2006, analysing the coherence of the party ideology between secretaries general, rank-and-file members and party statutes in Guatemala, uncovered that only the URNG showed internal congruence.

===Foreign policy===
The URNG maintains an amicable relationship with the Cuban government and has condemned the economic, financial and political blockade of Cuba, exerted by the United States.

===Environmental policy===
The party is generally opposed to large mining projects, citing the adverse effects these have on rural communities and the local environment, while profits are usually siphoned off to multinational companies.

===Domestic policy===
====CICIG====
The party supported the implementation of a UN sponsored Commission for the Investigation of Illegal Groups and Clandestine Security Organizations in Guatemala (CICIACS) reached in an agreement between the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Human Rights Ombudsman in March 2003, but heavily criticized the Berger administration for its approach towards its translation into law, which it viewed as weak and inadequate and inhibited by delay tactics.

In December 2006, a new agreement between the UN and the government led to the creation of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which finally began to operate in September 2007, after being greenlit by the Constitutional Court and Congress in May and August 2007, respectively.

====Judicial appointment process====
In May 2009, the party supported a bill presented by Nineth Montenegro and the civil society group Pro Justicia, that would regulate the selection process of magistrates. According to proponents of the law, the appointment process should be held in public to prohibit nepotism and ensure transparency.

====Non-governmental organizations====
In February 2019, the party voiced its opposition to initiative 5257, a bill concerning the regulation of non-governmental organizations, that would grant the president the power to prohibit NGO&#x27;s from operating in the country.

====Peace treaty implementation====
Party members have on multiple occasions complained that key aspects of the Firm and Lasting Accord have not been enacted in the aftermath of its signing. A study by the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame found that 10 years after the peace treaty coming into force, still less than 70 % of the peace treaty provisions had been implemented.

The party strongly objected to restitution payments to Ex-PAC fighters that were recruited to fight them during the civil war and dissolved during the peace negotiations in 1996.

====Press freedom====
In March 2023, the party condemned the intention of the government and judiciary to prosecute independent media outlets, particularly El Periódico and its journalists, which the party views as efforts to punish them for its investigations into the government.

===Security and military policy===
The party is opposed to the deployment of military police units to support the civil police in combating crime. In early 2000, the alliance heavily criticized a bill passed by Congress, extending the operational area of the military police force, calling it a direct violation of the peace treaty that explicitly reserves matters of internal security to the civil police force.

In April 2004, the party received the proposed cuts to the military budget by the Berger administration as a positive signal for the demilitarisation of the public sphere.

====&quot;Nuevos Horizontes&quot;====
In late 2006, the URNG opposed the approval of the US-military mission &quot;Nuevos Horizontes&quot; by Congress, entailing the stationing of US troops in San Marcos from January to August 2007. The party later in January 2010, also voiced their opposition to the reopening of military barracks in San Marcos, which would cost the state at least Q100m. Miguel Ángel Sandoval argued that this would just be another step to increase the militarisation of the department, arguing instead for an increased presence of civil police forces and an end to the impunity experienced by criminals.

===Economic policy===
====CAFTA====
Stating that they are not principally opposed to open markets, the party nonetheless opposed the ratification of CAFTA in early 2005, because it favoured genetically modified agricultural products, that are cheaper than home-grown cereals, thereby depriving small farmers of their livelihood.

====Mesoamerica Project====
In connection to the hydro power development plans linked to the Mesoamerica Project, formerly known as the Plan Puebla Panamá, the URNG demanded that the local population has to be involved in the planning process of these projects. Marcos Ramírez, the mayor of Playa Grande also stated that these projects should be built and maintained by the local and national governments instead of relinquishing control thereof to multinational corporations.

<doc id="329280" wikidata="Q838669" url="?curid=329280" title="Yamatotakada, Nara">
<text>is a city located in Nara Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 61,950 in 31312 households, and a population density of 3800 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Occupying a corner of the central-western part of the Nara Basin, most of the small city area is flat, with the northwestern part of the city forming the southern end of the Umami Hills. The Katsuragi River and the Takada River run through the city from north-to-south. The Soga River runs through the northeastern part of the city, near the border with Kashihara, and the Kuzugawa River runs through the northwestern part. The Takada River once ran east of its current course, but because it was plagued by flooding, rerouting work began in 1932, resulting in its current course. The old course was filled in and turned into a road, which became the current Japan National Route 166 and Nara Prefectural Route Yamato-Takada-Ikaruga Line, and traces of it remain in the place names along the road and relics such as bridge railings. In recent years, the use of farmland and reservoirs for housing has eliminated flood storage areas during heavy rains, and some parts of the city suffer from flooding above and below the floor level during heavy rains.

Yamatotakada has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Yamatotakada is 14.2 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1636 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.7 °C.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Yamatotakada is as shown below

==History==
The area of Yamatotakada was part of ancient Yamato Province. Inhabited since the Japanese Paleolithic, the city area nurtured paddy field agriculture in the fertile Nara Basin since ancient times. Numerous large keyhole-type burial mounds (&quot;kofun&quot;) were constructed in the northwestern part of the city around the 5th century. During the Sengoku period Takada Castle was constructed by the local Takada clan near the site of the current Katashio Elementary School, and the area developed as a castle town. During the Edo Period, it developed into a market town centered around cotton cultivation, which led to the development of spinning and textile industries after the Meiji restoration. The town of Takada was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was elevated to city status on January 1, 1948 and was renamed Yamatotakada to avoid confusing with similarly named cities in Iwate, Hiroshima and Oita.

Toshiharu Matsuda, who served as mayor of the city since 1992, resigned in 2003. During his terms of office he executed ambitious construction plans resulting in burdensome debt. He was also criticized for his connection with a gangster boss in the city of Nara. Masakatsu Yoshida, elected as new major in April, 2003, has had to cope with the deteriorating financial problems combined with a curtailed national subsidy and mounting unpaid city tax.

==Government==
Yamatotakada has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 17 members. Yamatotakada contributes three members to the Nara Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Nara 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
The city continues to develop as a local business and government center in the center of Nara Prefecture. The Yamatotakada area is a center for light manufacturing. Traditionally, the area is noted for the textile and hosiery industries. 

==Education==
Yamatotakada has eight public elementary schools, three public junior high schools, one public high school and one vocational training school operated by the city government and two public high schools operated by the Nara Prefectural Board of Education. There are also two private high schools and one private vocational training school.

==History==
The area of Yamatokōriyama was part of ancient Yamato Province, and many local neighborhood names appear in the early Heian period &quot;Engishiki&quot; records. The present day city center began as a castle town outside the gates of Kōriyama Castle during Sengoku period under the rule of Tsutsui Junkei and Toyotomi Hidenaga. During the Edo Period, it developed into a market town under Kōriyama Domain, which was ruled by a succession of &quot;fudai daimyō&quot; clans, notably the Yanagisawa clan although a portion of what is now within the city borders was part of the smaller Koizumi Domain ruled by the Katagiri clan. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Kōriyama and villages of Tsutsui, Yata, Honda, Hirahata, Jido, Heiwa, and Katagiri were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on 1 April 1889. Kōriyama annexed Tsutsui on 10 March 1941, and the remaining villages (with the exception of Katagiri) on 10 December 1953 and was raised to city status on 1 January 1954, becoming the city of Yamatokōriyama. Katagiri was annexed on 31 March 1957.

==Government==
Yamatokōriyama has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 20 members. Yamatokōriyama contributes three members to the Nara Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Nara 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
The city produces various agricultural, commercial, and factory products. For example, cultivation of rice and fresh vegetables such as strawberries and tomatoes is thriving.

A large shopping mall on the edge of the city and many large shopping centres in the suburbs are sustaining commercial industry. The &quot;Showa Kogyo Danchi,&quot; industrial zone, located in the southern part of the city is the largest in Nara Prefecture and employs a large number of workers. Recently, the numbers of laborers from Brazil and Asian countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia working there is on the increase. 

Yamatokoriyama is well known for the cultivation of goldfish, a motif widely seen around the city. In the Koriyama Castle site area, the original stone wall has remained intact for nearly 400 years, and the castle draws large numbers of visitors to the &quot;Oshiro Matsuri&quot; festival, which is held every year in the spring when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

<doc id="329283" wikidata="Q502196" url="?curid=329283" title="Tenri, Nara">
<text>is a city located in Nara Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 60,890 in 29456 households, and a population density of 700 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . The city is named after the Japanese new religion Tenrikyo, which has its headquarters in the city. 

==Geography==
Tenri is located in the north-central part of Nara Prefecture.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Nara Prefecture
* Nara
* Sakurai
* Yamatokōriyama
* Tawaramoto
* Miyake
* Kawanishi

===Climate===
Tenri has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Tenri is 13.4 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1636 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 1.9 °C.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tenri is as shown below

==History==
The area of Tenri is part of ancient Yamato Province. Tenri was briefly the capital of Japan during the reign of Emperor Ninken. The life of the Imperial court was centered at &quot;Isonokami Hirotaka&quot; Palace where the emperor lived in 488–498.

The village of Yamanobe was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to town status on September 26, 1893 and renamed Tambaichi (丹波市町). On April 1, 1954, Tambaichi merged with the villages of Asawa, Fukuzumi, and Nikaido and the towns of Ichinomoto and Yanagimoto to form the city of Tenri.

===Relations with Tenrikyo===

About a quarter of the city&#x27;s residents are believed to be affiliated with the Tenrikyo religion, and the remaining residents are thought to include several thousand students belonging to Tenrikyo-affiliated educational institutions.

Since almost half of the city area is occupied by non-taxable religious facilities related to Tenrikyo, the city has faced a problem of reduced revenue from property taxes, etc. To compensate for this, the religious organization has been making large donations to Tenri City since 1967. The amount of the donation is close to the total local tax revenue of Tenri City. The amount of the donation is decided in consultation between Tenri City and the religious organization when the annual budget is compiled, depending on the content of the city planning projects for that year. In addition, donations tend to increase sharply in years close to the Tenrikyo Founder&#x27;s Festival, which is held every 10 years. Thus, Tenri City cannot survive as a municipality without a relationship with the religious organization. While the city emphasizes its development as a city integrated with the sect, the Tenrikyo Church Headquarters has a policy of not fielding candidates in mayoral and city council elections.

==Government==
Tenri has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 16 members. Tenri contributes two members to the Nara Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Nara 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
There are many Tenrikyo-related facilities in the city center, giving it the appearance of a religious city, but the city as a whole is an agricultural area. Strawberry cultivation is particularly popular. Industrial activities center on semiconductors and light manufacturing. Due to its location on major east-west highways, the city is increasing becoming a commuter town for the great Osaka metropolis.

==Education==
Tenri has nine public elementary schools and five public junior high schools operated by the city government and two public high schools operated by the Nara Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private elementary school junior high schools and one private high school.

Tenri University and Tenri Health Care University, both private universities are located in the city.

==History==
The area of Kashihara was the center of ancient Yamato Province, and contains many kofun burial mounds. The exact spot of Emperor Jimmu&#x27;s accession to the imperial throne (i.e. the foundation of Japan) was debated for centuries until in 1863 scholars of national studies claimed to have identified an area within Kashihara as the exact location. The city was the location of the Imperial capital Fujiwara-kyō, from 694 to 710. During the Sengoku period, Imai-cho was a fortified city surrounded by a moat as a missionary base for the Ikko sect of Buddhism which fought against the army of Oda Nobunaga, but was disarmed, but was allowed to exercise jurisdiction and developed into an autonomous city. In the late 16th century it was said to be one of the two richest autonomous cities of Japan, as in &quot;Umi no Sakai, Riku no Imai&quot; (tr. &quot;by the sea, Sakai – inland, Imai&quot; - Imai or :ja:今井町 is now a part of Kashihara).

The town of Imai was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on February 11, 1956 by merging with the towns of Yagi and Unebi and the villages of Masuge, Kamoko and Maminashi. The city annexed the villages of Kanahashi and Shinzawa on July 3, 1956.

==Geography==
Hashimoto is located near the prefectural border at the northeastern end of Wakayama Prefecture, bordering Kawachinagano in Osaka Prefecture to the north and Gojō in Nara Prefecture to the east. There are also a couple of small exclaves in the neighboring towns of Katsuragi, Wakayama, and Kudoyama. Because it is close to the plate boundary on the south coast of Honshu, the mountains near Hashimoto are steep; the city is located between the Kongō Mountains and Kisen Mountains in the north and the Kii Mountains in the south.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hashimoto peaked at around the year 2000 and has declined slightly since.

==History==
The area of the modern city of Hashimoto was within ancient Kii Province, and artifacts from the Jōmon period indicate a long period of human occupancy. Located in the middle reaches of the Kinokawa River, it once prospered as a post town for timber transportation and for pilgrims heading to Mount Kōya. During the late Edo period and Meiji period, sericulture and silk textiles became an important part of the local economy, but they have now disappeared. The village of Hashimoto was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, and was raised to town status on May 10, 1894. On January 1, 1955, Hashimoto merged with the neighboring villages of Kishikami, Yamada, Kimi, Suda, and Kamuro to form the city of Hashimoto.

==Economy==
The mainstay of the local economy is horticulture, especially that of Japanese persimmons and Japanese pears, as well as the poultry industry. The area has traditionally been known for its Japanese white crucian carp fish farms and its textiles. As the only city in Wakayama prefecture that is included in the Osaka metropolitan area (in terms of urban employment), there are an increasing number of commuters, gradually transforming the area into a bedroom community.

<doc id="329314" wikidata="Q3760771" url="?curid=329314" title="Georgie Porgie">
<text>&quot;Georgie Porgie&quot; is a popular English language nursery rhyme. It has the Roud Folk Song Index number 19532.

==Origins and variations==
Originally the lyrics were:
:Georgie Porgie, pudding and pie,
:Kissed the girls and made them cry,
:When the girls came out to play,
:Georgie Porgie ran away.

These appeared in &quot;The Kentish Coronal&quot; (1841), where the rhyme was described as an &quot;old ballad&quot; with the name spelled &quot;Georgy Peorgy&quot;. That version persisted through most of the 19th century and was later illustrated by Kate Greenaway in 1881. It was also quoted by Rudyard Kipling in the story named after it, published in 1891.

James Halliwell-Phillipps did not record the words in his first collection of &quot;The Nursery Rhymes of England&quot;, but in the fifth edition of 1853 he included a variant:
:Rowley Powley, pumpkin pie,
:Kissed the girls and made them cry;
:When the girls begin to cry,
:Rowley Powley runs away. 
And a Cheshire dialect version was quoted in 1887 with the variant &quot;picklety pie&quot; in place of Halliwell&#x27;s &quot;pumpkin pie&quot;.

But by 1884 a version had appeared in which the third line read &quot;When the boys came out to play&quot;, and it was this reading which Iona and Peter Opie chose to perpetuate in their day in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes&quot; (1951). They also mentioned there various unsubstantiated conjectures that link the character Georgie Porgie to British historical figures, including King George I and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, claims that have been copied in other works of reference to this day.

Among children the verse has been used as a rhyming taunt for boys called George, or else of fat boys. It is also used to harass a boy who is considered not sufficiently manly, either because he is thought to fancy a girl, or (with a switch of sexes in line two) who is accused of being homosexually inclined. It can also be used to tease a girl who fancies a boy, where, with other appropriate changes, she is addressed as &quot;Rosie Posie&quot;.

==Musical versions==

The rhyme was included in &quot;National Nursery Rhymes&quot; (London, 1870), a volume illustrated by George Dalziel and Edward Dalziel, where the words were set to music by James William Elliott. And in 1885 they were set as a part song by the Canadian composer Joseph Gould under his musical pseudonym, Spencer Percival.

In 1924, Billy Mayerl and Gerald &quot;Gee&quot; Paul adapted the first two lines into the chorus of a novelty foxtrot which was featured in the revue &quot;The Punch Bowl&quot; by Norman O&#x27;Neill and subsequently covered by various jazz bands.

The 1978 song &quot;Georgy Porgy&quot; by Toto also features the first two lines of the rhyme.

Tsuyama was the center of ancient Mimasaka Province and the location of its kokufu and the Mimasaka Kokubun-ji. It was also on the pilgrimage route to Izumo Shrine and had a number of inn stations. In the latter half of the Sengoku period, Mori Ranmaru&#x27;s younger brother, Mori Tadamasa, received the area as his domain. He constructed Tsuruyama Castle on the site of an ancient castle which had been erected by the Yamana clan, and laid out a new castle town which became the nucleus of the modern city. At the same time, Tsuruyama was renamed &quot;Tsuyama&quot;. 

Under the Tokugawa Shogunate, Tsuyama Castle was the headquarters of a cadet branch of the Matsudaira clan and the center of Tsuyama Domain. Tsuyama is known for the 17th century Tsuyama Castle, whose grandeur was said to rival that of Himeji Castle in neighboring Hyōgo Prefecture. The castle was destroyed in 1874.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kasaoka in 2020 is 46,088 people. Kasaoka has been conducting censuses since 1950.
== History ==
The Kasaoka area is part of ancient Bitchū Province and numerous shell middens from the Jōmon period confirm that the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The place name &#x27;Kasaoka&#x27; is said to have been derived from the area of influence of the &#x27;Kasaomi clan&#x27; of the ancient Kingdom of Kibi. Kasaoka Castle, was built by Murakami Takashige at the end of the Muromachi period and was controlled by the Mōri clan during the Sengoku period. Under the Edo Period Tokugawa shogunate, the area became part of the territory of the Mizuno clan of Fukuyama Domain. The Mizuno invested vast sums of money in civil engineering projects to promote the development of new rice fields in Kasaoka, which originally had little flat land. However, the domain fell to attainder in the middle of the Edo period, and the Kasaoka area was ruled as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory about 170 years until the end of the Edo period.

Following the Meiji restoration, the village of Kasaoka was established within Oda District, Okayama with the creation of the modern municipalities system on June 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on October 23, 1891 and to city status on April 1, 1952. Due to its strong historical, cultural and economic ties with Fukuyama, proposals have been made for a merger between the two municipalities.

==Government==
Kasaoka has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 17 members. Kasaoka contributes two members to the Okayama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Okayama 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Kasaoka is located in the Seto Inland Sea Industrial Belt and together with neighboring Fukuyama was designated in 1964 as the &quot;Bingo District Special Industrial Development Area&quot;. The city has a high concentration of heavy industry, notably related to JFE Steel, a major producer of crude steel in Japan. Agriculture, food processing are also major contributors to the local economy, although the traditional industries stone quarrying and production of pyrethrum are in decline due to competition from foreign sources. The city is also increasing a commuter town for neighboring Fukuyama and Kurashiki.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Takahashi in 2020 is 29,072 people. Takahashi has been conducting censuses since 1920.

==History ==
Takahashi was part of ancient Bitchū Province. In the Kamakura period, a cadet branch of the Miura clan was appointed &quot;jito&quot; and constructed a castle in what is now the center of Takahashi city. From 1331, the area was under the control of Takahashi Muneyasu of the Miyoshi clan, who changed in the name of the castle to &quot;Matsuyama&quot;. In the Muromachi period and Sengoku period, the area was highly contested as it was a central transportation hub in Bitchū Province. After the 1600 Battle of Sekigahara, the Tokugawa shogunate established Bitchū-Matsuyama Domain. In the Bakumatsu period, this domain was ruled by a cadet branch of the Itakura clan, and supported the shogunate in the Boshin War. Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Takahashi was established on June 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on May 1, 1954.

On October 1, 2004, Takahashi absorbed the town of Ukan (from Jōbō District), and the towns of Nariwa, Kawakami and Bitchū (all from Kawakami District) to become the new and expanded city of Takahashi. Kawakami District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Government==
Takahashi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members. The city contributes one member to the Okayama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Okayama 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Takahashi is largely agricultural. Most of the farmland is located in the plateau area at an altitude of around 400 meters, and fruit trees and vegetables are actively cultivated taking advantage of the cool climate. Takahashi was originally one of the prefecture&#x27;s leading leaf tobacco producing areas, but due to the shift to highly profitable grape and tomato crops, the shipment volume of leaf tobacco has decreased. Takahashi has also been a tea-producing area since ancient times. In addition to the large temperature difference between day and night, fog weakens ultraviolet rays and has the effect of suppressing bitterness, which helps grow high-quality tea leaves. In terms of poultry farming, there are large-scale poultry farms run by corporations outside the city scattered throughout the city,

==Education==
Takahashi has 14 public elementary schools and six public junior high schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Okayama Prefectural Board of Education. Kibi International University is a private university located in Takahashi.

<text>Victoriaville () is a town in south-central Quebec, Canada, on the Nicolet River. Victoriaville is the seat of Arthabaska Regional County Municipality and a part of the Centre-du-Québec (Bois-Francs) region. It is formed by the 1993 merger of Arthabaska, Saint-Victoire-d&#x27;Arthabaska and Victoriaville, the name of the last being used for the merged town.

==Description==
Victoriaville&#x27;s size and location have earned it the title &quot;Capitale des Bois-Francs&quot;, referring to the Bois-Francs region of the province. Victoriaville produces numerous hardwood products, including furniture, caskets, and hockey sticks. The town was home to the famous Victoriaville hockey company.
The Parc-Linéaire Des Bois-Francs bike trail traverses Victoriaville. There are many paths for cyclists throughout the town, including ones leading to the summit of Mont Arthabaska, at the southern limits of the town. The Laurier Museum is located in the home of former Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, which is designated Wilfrid Laurier House National Historic Site.

Many festivals are held throughout the year including the Week-end En Blues series of concerts, the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville (FIMAV) in the spring, and the Exposition Agricole in the summer.

Investment in the industrial park has buoyed the town and spurred new residential and commercial development. It is the home of a prominent Lactantia dairy factory, two shopping malls (&quot;La Grande Place des Bois-Francs&quot; and &quot;Le Carrefour des Bois-Francs&quot;, this one has been renamed and became &quot;le Centre de Victoriaville&quot;), the Cégep de Victoriaville, and a quaint yet vibrant downtown core/shopping area on Rue Notre-Dame. Victoriaville Airport, located at the town&#x27;s northern limits close to Route 116, is a regional airport that receives business flights and light private planes.

The current mayor of Victoriaville is Antoine Tardif who was elected as mayor of Victoriaville in the 2021 mayoral election.

Victoriaville is the seat of the judicial district of Arthabaska.

==History==
The Victoriaville area was known to the native Abenaki peoples as Arthabaska or &quot;Awabaska&quot;, meaning &quot;place of bulrushes and reeds&quot;. The area was first claimed in 1802 by a fur trader named John Gregory; the first settlers began arriving several decades later, beginning around 1825. Early colonists from the banks of the Saint Lawrence River arrived slowly, blazing trails as they went; the first provincial road would be built in 1844. The parish of Saint-Christophe d&#x27;Arthabaska was established in 1851, an event that many see as marking the town&#x27;s true foundation. In 1854 a train station was erected to serve the Grand Trunk Railway line from Richmond to Lévis, uniting the region with Montreal and Quebec City. The municipality of Victoriaville itself was created on May 8, 1861, named to honour Queen Victoria, the reigning monarch at the time. Victoriaville became a full-fledged town in 1890, having reached a population of 1,000.

Among the many milestones in the growth of Victoriaville are the establishment of a hospital, the Hôtel-Dieu d&#x27;Arthabaska, in 1931; the opening of a seminary, the Collège du Sacré-Coeur, in 1942; the creation of a school specialized in cabinet making and woodworking, the École Québécoise du Meuble et du Bois Ouvré (ÉQMBO), in 1965; and the inauguration of the Cégep de Victoriaville in the space previously occupied by the Collège du Sacré-Coeur, in 1969. Train service through Victoriaville was discontinued in 1960; the disused train tracks were eventually removed and the space was transformed into bicycle paths, forming the Parc Linéaire — with a &quot;Vélogare&quot; replacing the old station. In March 1941, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) established No. 3 Initial Training School, at the Collège du Sacré-Coeur. The RCAF school trained potential pilots and Navigators on common topics and divided the trainees into their trades. The RCAF school was closed in November 1944.

In June 1993, after a referendum on amalgamation, the municipalities of Sainte-Victoire-D&#x27;Arthabaska, Arthabaska and Victoriaville merged to form the town of Victoriaville. The aboriginal name &quot;Arthabaska&quot;, unique and well-appreciated by residents, was retained in several ways, notably in the name of the regional county municipality and in the name of the highest (and only) mountain that overlooks the town; as well, in 2004, the section of Route 116 that passes through Victoriaville was renamed boulevard Arthabaska.

==Economy==
Textiles, wood products and furniture products have long been the heart of the economy, but their presence have declined in the past years. A large Lactantia factory producing butter, cheeses and other dairy products has been a major employer for decades. Water filtered from Réservoir Beaudet is said to be some of the best water worldwide.

==Arts and culture==
The Carré 150 is Victoriaville&#x27;s principal venue for professional performing and visual artists. Each year, the programme includes over 250 performances in music, theatre, comedy, dance, repertory films and more. The complex comprises four spaces: a large Italian-style auditorium with 855 seats, a black box cabaret with 260 seats or 500 standing for general admission, a rehearsal studio and a contemporary art exhibition centre, the Centre d&#x27;art Jacques-et-Michel-Auger. The Grand foyer Victoriaville-et-sa-région, remarkable for its vast windows, hosts numerous cocktail parties, often extending into the Lounge Laurier or the Terrasse Daniel-Gaudreau.

==Media==
The weekly newspaper &quot;La Nouvelle-Union&quot;, is a major source of the town&#x27;s local news, since national news organisations tend to run larger stories affecting larger areas or cities.

Two radio stations, CFJO (&quot;O97,3&quot;) and CFDA (&quot;Passion-Rock 101,9&quot;) serve Victoriaville. Both stations air programming produced partially in Victoriaville and partially in Thetford Mines. CKYQ (&quot;KYQ FM&quot;), a station licensed to Plessisville, also has a studio and a transmitter in Victoriaville.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Victoriaville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Sports==
Jean Béliveau (August 31, 1931 – December 2, 2014), ten-time Stanley Cup winner with the Montreal Canadiens, was raised in Victoriaville after moving there from Trois-Rivières at a young age.

The town is currently home to the Victoriaville Tigres junior hockey team, who have played in the QMJHL since 1987. They play at the Colisée Desjardins.

The total area of the city is . With a strong industrial and naval heritage, Kure hosts the second-oldest naval dockyard in Japan and remains an important base for the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force.

== History ==
The area of Kure is part of ancient Aki Province, and the port of Kure was an important seaport for Hiroshima Domain in the Edo period.

The Kure Naval District was first established in 1889, leading to the construction of the Kure Naval Arsenal and the rapid growth of steel production and shipbuilding in the city. Kure was formally incorporated on October 1, 1902. From 1889 until the end of the Pacific War, the city served as the headquarters of the Kure Naval District.

Kure dockyards recorded a number of significant engineering firsts including the launching of the first major domestically built capital ship, the battlecruiser (1905) and the launching of the largest battleship ever built, the (1940).

During the Pacific War, Kure acted as the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s single-largest naval base and arsenal. Most of the city&#x27;s industry and workforce were employed in the service of the naval installations, munitions factories and associated support functions. In the later stages of the conflict Kure came under sustained aerial bombardment culminating in the bombing of Kure in June and July 1945.

From February 1946 until the end of Japan&#x27;s postwar occupation in 1952, military establishments in Kure served as the operational headquarters for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force.

Since 2005, Kure has attracted attention as a tourism center with the Yamato Museum hosting a 1:10 scale model of the &quot;Yamato&quot; alongside a waterfront JMSDF museum of Japanese naval history.

The city continues as a major maritime center hosting both the dockyards of Japan Marine United and numerous shore-based facilities of the JMSDF including training centers and a major hospital. The city serves as the home port of an Escort Flotilla (Destroyers), a Submarine Flotilla and the Training Squadron of the JMSDF Regional Kure District.

<text>is a city located in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 49,106 in 23154 households and a population density of 63 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Miyoshi is located almost in the middle of the Chugoku region, with the Chugoku Mountains to the north and a flat agricultural area to the south. Together with the neighboring city of Shōbara, it forms the northern part of the prefecture called the &quot;Bihoku region&quot;. Because the tributaries of the Enokawa River meet at the Miyoshi Basin, it prospered as a river port and has long functioned as a strategic point for culture, economy, and transportation connecting the San&#x27;in and San&#x27;yō regions. About one-third of the rain that falls in Hiroshima Prefecture is collected here, and it has abundant water. Due to the confluence of rivers, fog tends to occur in this area from late autumn to early spring. The center of urban area is the Miyoshi Basin, which is located between the Chugoku Mountains and the Kibi Plateau at an elevation of 150 to 250 meters. Miyoshi developed as a twin settlement, with &quot;Itsukaichi&quot;, as the castle town of the Miyoshi clan towards the west, and the current city center district where Miyoshi Station is located as a market town called &#x27;Tokaichi-machi&#x27; to the east.

<text>is a city located in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 116,087 in 53320 households and a population density of 240 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Hatsukaichi is located in far southwestern Hiroshima Prefecture. In the north, the spine of the Chugoku Mountains borders Shimane and Yamaguchi prefectures, and in the south is the coastline of the Seto Inland Sea (Hiroshima Bay). While the coastal areas are becoming more urbanized, the inland rural areas are undergoing marked depopulation.

*Etajima
*Ōtake
*Saeki-ku, Hiroshima

Yamaguchi Prefecture
*Iwakuni

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hatsukaichi has more than doubled since 1960.
==Climate==
==History==
The area of Hatsukaichi is part of ancient Aki Province. Itsukushima Shrine developed greatly at the end of the Heian period under the patronage of Taira no Kiyomori and gained influence in the region. As the shrine was occasionally destroyed by fire or natural disasters, the Kamakura shogunate, ordered many metal casters moved to the area on the opposite bank (present-day Honmachi, Hatsukaichi City), and the accumulation of living and rebuilding materials such as salt and wood began. Since the last day of the festival held four times a year at Itsukushima Shrine was the 20th, a market began to be held on the 20th of each month as early as the middle of the Kamakura period, and the market on the 20th is called &#x27;Hatsukaichi&#x27;. This name appears in official documents from 1454, and since this period, Hatsukaichi has developed as a port and a timber industry town based on the collection of timber from the western Chugoku Mountains. During the Edo Period, the area was part of the holdings of Hiroshima Domain. Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Hatsukaichi was established within Saeki District, Hiroshima on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Hatsukaichi merged with four neighboring villages to become the city of Hatsukaichi on April 1, 1988.

On March 1, 2003, the town of Saeki and the village of Yoshiwa, both from Saeki District, merged into the expanded city of Hatsukaichi. On November 3, 2005, the towns of Miyajima and Ōno (both from Saeki District) were merged into Hatsukaichi. Therefore, Saeki District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Government==
Hatsukaichi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 28 members. Hatsukaichi contributes two members to the Hiroshima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Hiroshima 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Hatsukaichi is one of the cities that make up the Hiroshima metropolitan area, and was formerly an industrial city noted for its timber industry, wood processing and food processing, as well as commercial fishing. It is increasing a commuter town for neighboring Hiroshima. However, after the mergers of 2003 and 2005, the city gained a large agricultural hinterland, as well as the major tourist attraction of Itsukushima Shrine.

==Education==
Hatsukaichi has 16 public elementary schools and seven public junior high schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Hiroshima Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

<text>Grande Prairie is a city in northwestern Alberta, Canada, within the southern portion of an area known as Peace River Country. It is located at the intersection of Highway 43 (part of the CANAMEX Corridor) and Highway 40 (the Bighorn Highway), approximately northwest of Edmonton. The city is surrounded by the County of Grande Prairie No. 1.

Grande Prairie was the seventh-largest city in Alberta in 2016, with a population of 63,166, and was one of Canada&#x27;s fastest growing cities between 2001 and 2006, and Canada&#x27;s northernmost city with more than 50,000 people.

The city has adopted the trumpeter swan as its official symbol due to its proximity to the bird&#x27;s migration route and its summer nesting grounds. For that reason, Grande Prairie is sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Swan City&quot;. The dinosaur has also emerged as an unofficial symbol of the city due to paleontology discoveries in the areas north and west of Grande Prairie.

== History ==

The Grande Prairie area was historically known as Buffalo Plains, after the buffalo who would traverse the large prairie which lies to the north, east, and west of it. Émile Grouard, a Roman Catholic Priest, was the first to refer to the area as La Grande Prairie. In the 18th century, the prairie was occupied by bands of the Dane-zaa (Beaver) peoples, who began, in the early 19th century, trading with the North West Company at Dunvegan. The earliest recorded reference to the prairie was by Hudson Bay trader Samuel Black in 1824.

In 1880, as a result of the fur trade war between the Hudson Bay Company (which merged with the North West Company in 1821), and independent fur traders, centering around Dunvegan, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company outpost called La Grande Prairie was established by George Kennedy. The post was established South of Dunvegan and north west of the present day city of Grande Prairie, south east of La Glace Lake, and west of what is now the Town of Sexsmith (the 1896 version of this building was moved and restored and now stands near the Grande Prairie Museum).

In the late 19th century, the prairie was settled by Cree and Iroquois from around Jasper and Lac Ste. Anne. When 17 townships were surveyed for homesteading in 1909, a land rush soon followed, with many settlers arriving over the Edson Trail. In 1910, the Grande Prairie Townsite was sub-divided. By 1912, it included a bank, hotel, post office, and land office, making it a district metropolis. In 1916, it became the terminus of the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway from Edmonton.

The Edson Trail from Edson to Grande Prairie was opened in 1911 as a means for settlers to reach the Grande Prairie area. It was basically nothing more than a tract of clear cut bush and forest, and was thus a very difficult route for many settlers, especially during wet weather. Because of this, large scale settlement came late compared to other major farming regions further south in Canada. Grande Prairie was incorporated as a village by the Province of Alberta in 1914, but it was not until the arrival of the railway in 1916 that farmland quickly expanded as waves of settlers came into the Peace region.

The arrival of the railway and the increased settlement in the area drove up Grande Prairie&#x27;s population past the 1,000 mark, allowing it to incorporate as a town on March 27, 1919. A local recession in the 1920s caused a temporary depopulation of Grande Prairie. But the population rebounded afterwards by the 1930s, by which time the population had reached 1,464. Settlement continued unabated even into the 1930s during the Dust Bowl era because the Peace Region was able to escape the severe drought conditions that plagued the Canadian Prairies further south at the time.

The Second World War saw the US and Canadian military establish Grande Prairie as a part of the Northwest Staging Route and for the construction of the Alaska Highway from Dawson Creek to Alaska. Although Dawson Creek was chosen as the major starting point of the construction of the Alaska Highway, Grande Prairie was a major stopover point for military aircraft during the war, and benefited economically from this.

Although Grande Prairie was well located in the southern edge of the Peace Country, it was competing with the towns of Peace River and Dawson Creek for the title of the most important centre of commerce and agriculture in the region until the late 1950s, when its population growth began to outstrip these towns as oil and natural gas exploration was underway in the Peace Region, especially since the first major discovery of oil further south in Leduc near Edmonton in 1947 and the construction of a large pulp mill south of the city in the early 1970s.

The construction and paving of Highway 43 (originally sections of Highways 2, 34, and 43 from the BC border to the Yellowhead Highway just west of Edmonton) in 1956 cut down on the travel time by road significantly, further enhancing Grande Prairie&#x27;s accessibility and economic status.

The town of Grande Prairie was incorporated as a city in 1958. At that time, its population was approximately 7,600.

The opening of the Procter &amp; Gamble kraft pulp mill in 1972 and the discovery of the Elmworth deep basin gas field spurred an economic boom. Grande Prairie&#x27;s population went from just over 12,000 in the early 1970s to over 24,000 by the time the oil boom went bust in 1981.

In the five years from 2001 to 2006, Grande Prairie was one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada, growing from 37,000 to 47,000 people. After 2006, and with another recession, the population decreased slightly, followed by a slow increase to just over 69,000 by 2018.

== Geography ==

Grande Prairie is located just north of the 55th parallel north, and is northwest of Edmonton, lying at an elevation of above sea level. The city is surrounded by farmland to the north, east, and west. To the south lies a vast boreal forest with aspen, tamarack, lodgepole pine, jack pine, and black spruce extending well into the foothills of the Canadian Rockies south and southwest of the city. The city actually lies on the southern edge of aspen parkland, which is a transitional biome between boreal forest and prairie. The Peace River Country contains the northernmost area of aspen parkland in North America.

Bear Creek goes through the city from the northwest to the southeast and is a tributary of the Wapiti River to the south. The Bear Creek Reservoir is the small body of water by Northwestern Polytechnic in the northwest part of the city, and is ringed by marshy wetland. The terrain immediately surrounding Grande Prairie is largely flat to gently rolling, but rises gradually to hilly terrain closer to the foothills to the south and southwest. On clear days, some peaks in the Rockies are visible to the southwest from Grande Prairie.

=== Climate ===
Grande Prairie has a northern continental climate typical of northwestern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia, classified as humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;), bordering closely on a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) with old data under the Köppen climate classification. Winters are generally very cold with some mild spells. Summers are often fairly cool to pleasantly warm in the daytime, but nights can be cool despite the long summer days typical for its latitude. Hot days over are rare, occurring on average only two to three days a year, which is not unexpected this far north. Winter conditions can vary tremendously from year to year. Winters have been known to be mild enough to produce &quot;brown Christmas&quot; conditions, where little or no snow may fall until after Christmas due to unusually mild early winter conditions.

The average January temperature is , while the average July temperature is . However, temperatures as low as and as high as have been recorded; the extreme humidex and wind chill readings are , respectively. The city receives of precipitation annually, including of rain and of snow. Snowfall amounts, however, vary greatly from year to year. Being fairly close to the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, it can get quite windy in Grande Prairie, especially in the spring and fall. Chinooks may occur in and bring winter thaws to the Grande Prairie area.
Grande Prairie has 314 days with measureable sunshine per year on average, and just above 2,200 hours of bright sunshine or about 46.1% of possible sunshine, ranging from a low of 31.2% in November to a high of 59.1% in July.

Summers can bring thunderstorms, although they are not as frequent nor as severe as those further south in Central Alberta. Rainfall can vary from year to year, but the Peace Region is noted for never having experienced truly severe drought conditions more typical of Southern Alberta and neighbouring Saskatchewan. Tornadoes are rare but not unheard of in the Peace Region. A tornado struck the downtown area and east side of Grande Prairie on July 8, 2004. Although the tornado was considered a very weak one (F0-F1 on the Fujita scale) and the weather was not severe at the time, it was still strong enough to damage houses and flip vehicles. There were no casualties or deaths.

===Crime rate===
Until 2015, Grande Prairie topped the list for the national average for the Crime Severity Index, but by 2016 a report published by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, stated that the city had dropped to 12th place.

The Crime Severity Index was 150 per 100,000 people, compared to the national average of 70.96. Grande Prairie was 13th on the Violent Crime Severity Index with 139 per 100,000 people versus a 75.25 average for all municipalities included in the report.

== Economy ==

Grande Prairie possesses a diversified economy. Major industries include oil and gas, agriculture, forestry, and food services.

Agriculture was the first economic mainstay of Grande Prairie since settlement began in the early 20th century. It remains part of the local economy today. A variety of crops such as barley, wheat, canola, and oats are grown in the area. Livestock such as cattle and buffalo (bison) are also raised in the area. Despite being north of the 55th parallel, the climate is mild enough to allow for farming on a large scale to prosper. Longer daylight hours during the summer at this latitude aid in crop production. The Peace Country is the northernmost major farming region in North America. Land within the region is still being cleared for new farmland.

Although some oil and gas drilling has been ongoing in the area since the 1950s, oil and gas exploration did not begin to occur on a large scale until the late 1970s. It was in the mid to late-1970s that the Elmworth gas field was discovered and developed, causing the city to grow rapidly until the oil boom ended in 1981. Today Grande Prairie&#x27;s location atop both the Montney and Duvernay geological formations have seen local extraction activities focused on natural-gas condensate and shale gas. As a result of this focus the region has maintained relatively high levels of activity when compared to areas where conventional resources, shallow gas or heavy oil are the primary resources.

Forestry is a major part of Grande Prairie&#x27;s economy, for large tracts of forest lie to the south in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies. International Paper (formerly Weyerhaeuser Canada) kraft pulp mill, opened in 1972 by Procter &amp; Gamble, is one of Grande Prairie&#x27;s largest employers. Canfor runs a sawmill and lumber yard operation on the west side of the city. Norbord (formerly Ainsworth) oriented strand board plant opened in late 1995.

Grande Prairie serves as the economic and transportation hub for a trading area of nearly 290,000 people. Grande Prairie is also on the CANAMEX trade route linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

== Government and politics ==
The Grande Prairie provincial district was formed in 1930. Beginning in 1993 the Grande Prairie-Wapiti and Grande Prairie-Smoky districts were formed. In 2017 the Grande Prairie-Smoky electoral district was abolished.

==Arts and culture==
Live music can be found in several downtown bars and intermittently at all-ages locations such as Tito&#x27;s Restaurant and the GP Curling Club. Summer-long music festivals have been organized by community-minded individuals and charitable organizations. Grande Prairie has a wide range of local music genres, including country (such as Tenille Townes, Brad Sims, and more); reggae (Tasman Jude); metal (Arrival of Autumn); folk; rock, and more

Cultural venues include Bonnetts Energy Centre (a concert hall and hockey rink—the local AJHL team, the Grande Prairie Storm, plays there), the Grande Prairie Museum, the Art Gallery of Grande Prairie, 214 place, the tallest commercial building in the city, and Second Street Theatre. Grande Prairie is also home to a professional musical theatre company, &quot;Broadway Live Broadway&quot;.

The Reel Shorts Film Festival is a five-day international festival of short films that takes place at Grande Prairie Live Theatre&#x27;s Second Street Theatre in early May.

The Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum, located fifteen minutes west of Grande Prairie, is a building with many exhibits, a large theatre, classrooms, a paleontology lab, a gift shop, and a restaurant. The museum is named after Philip J. Currie, from the University of Alberta, who has contributed to the understanding of the link between dinosaurs and birds.

The Bear Creek Folk Music Festival, first held in 2016, is an outdoor music festival held in late August on Borstad Hill in Muskoseepi Park. The festival is funded in part by the City of Grande Prairie.

== Sports and recreation ==
In 1995, the city hosted the Canada Games. The event was televised nationally on CBC Television. Hundreds of athletes competed in the events and the city gained status and recognition as a result. The city played host to the 2010 Arctic Winter Games from March 6–13, 2010.

There are a number of parks in Grande Prairie, including the large Muskoseepi Park in the Bear Creek valley which winds its way throughout the city. Muskoseepi Park has excellent walking and bike trails extending nearly the entire length of Bear Creek, from the northwest to the southeast of the city. The park also contains the Ernie Radbourne Pavilion, the outdoor Bear Creek Swimming Pool and the outdoor Muskoseepi Park Pond which converts into a skating rink in the winter.

Crystal Lake in the northeast part of the city also has parkland, preserved wetlands (great for birdwatching), and walking/bike paths around its entire circumference.

Nestled within spruce and pine trees, on the south east side of the city, just a couple of minutes from downtown, is Evergreen Park. The park and facilities are home to the annual Grande Prairie Stompede event, which draws upwards of 30,000 people annually. The park is the largest full featured exhibition facility north of Edmonton, and can cater to upwards of 10,000 people at a time. It has a restaurant (open daily) and a lounge, and hosts events such as agricultural shows, rodeos, chuckwagon races, horse racing, sportsman and RV shows. A variety of halls, convention spaces and conference facilities all with paved parking are available. The largest building, the Entrec Centre has of space, with a main hall, and has hosted many concerts and trade shows in the past. Evergreen Park also has a 76 spot RV and Marine Campground which is open in the summer from May to October, as well as an archery centre, an equestrian facility, and 12 baseball diamonds, which are home to the Grande Prairie Reds Baseball Club.

Grande Prairie has three 18-hole golf courses, The Dunes Golf and Winter Club, the Bear Creek Golf Club, and the Grande Prairie Golf and Country Club. A fourth golf course, Grovedale Golf Course, is also located approximately to the southwest of the city.

Early in 2017, a new nine hole course, &quot;The Bear Paw Golf Course&quot;, with a par level of 3 opened up in the &quot;South Bear Creek Recreation Area.&quot;

Grande Prairie has three 18-hole disc golf courses. Thrill Hill in the Swanavon neighbourhood, South Bear Creek, and Coop Community Course at Evergreen Park.

Downhill skiing is popular in Grande Prairie, which has a local ski hill called Nitehawk and is located south of the city on the south bank of the Wapiti River. Aside from skiing, Nitehawk also has the only North American natural luge track certified for international events, and over the summer months freestyle ski jumpers practice using the Northern Extreme water ramp facility. It is also active in luge as a naturally refrigerated venue, hosting the FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships in 2007.

Cross-country skiing is also common during the winter. The Wapiti Nordic Ski Club is one of Canada&#x27;s premier cross country skiing and biathlon facilities, and is just south of the city. There are over of both classical and skate skiing trails, as well as of nightly lit trails. There are also snowshoe trails as well as dog friendly trails. In the summer, the trails are used for hiking, mountain biking, and running.

The foothills south of Grande Prairie and around Grande Cache are visited year-round for hiking in the summer and for snowmobiling and other winter sports in the winter. Kakwa Wildland Park on the Alberta-BC border, about south of the city, is a mountainous natural area and is known for the Kakwa Falls.

On the South side of the city, off of Resources Road, is the Wapiti Shooters Club. The club was founded in 1949, and due to the many upgrades over the years is considered one of the finest shooting clubs in Alberta. It offers Shotgun (Trap, Sporting Clays, and Skeet), Handgun (outdoor 12 lanes, indoor 6 lanes), and a outdoor covered rifle range. The club is also used for business functions, birthday parties, RCMP, Sheriff, and Safety training. Over the years many top level coaches and athletes from all over Canada have trained or entered into events at the club. In addition, the club is currently developing a long () rifle range suitable for high power rifles, north of the city, near Webster. There is also an indoor shooting range (Bullets and Broadheads) across the street from (west of) the Prairie Mall.

Grande Prairie also has a new and modern health and fitness facility known as the Eastlink Centre. It is a large indoor fitness facility that has two indoor pools: a 50-meter, deep water Olympic sized pool, and a 25-meter, wheelchair accessible, higher temperature, shallow water Program Pool. Other aquatic amenities include a splash park, a lazy river, waterslides, and a surf simulator. The facility also includes a large weight room, squash and racquetball courts, fitness classes, a daycare service, a multi-use basketball court, a summer outdoor 5,000 sq. ft. concrete skateboard park, and additional other amenities and programs. The Eastlink Centre is located in the city&#x27;s southwest and connects St. Joseph High School, the Grande Prairie Gymnastics Centre, the Design Works Centre, and Charles Spencer High School. In March 2012 the Eastlink Centre received an award for its exceptional accessibility features.

The Outdoor Bear Creek (Aquatera) Swimming Pool, in Muskoseepi Park, was reopened in the summer of 2019, after extensive modifications. The new renovations include a Tots Pool, a Zero Beach, Spanish Steps, Lily Islands, a Games Area, and a Waterslide.

The Leisure Centre (previously known as the Rec-Plex) is located in northwest Grande Prairie near the Bear Creek Reservoir. In December 2011, after the Eastlink Centre opened, the majority of the Leisure Centre was closed, with unrealized plans to reopen in the second half of 2013. Currently the swimming pool and gym remain closed, but the indoor soccer pitch is open for a variety of sports.

Over the years Grande Prairie has played host to many tournaments including:
*2004 Royal Bank Cup
*2006 Ford World Women&#x27;s Curling Championship
*2009 Players&#x27; Championship
*2010 Arctic Winter Games

*2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts

The city also has the following ice hockey teams:

== Transportation ==
=== Air ===
The Grande Prairie Airport is located at the west end of the city and serves the region with daily scheduled flights to Calgary and Edmonton. Two airlines, Air Canada and WestJet, offer service to the airport. The airport saw a reduction in flights in 2023. The Grande Prairie Airport was originally developed in the 1930s as a grass only strip at its present site. In 1941 in support of the war effort, and the building of the Alaska Highway, the facility was expanded for utilization by the Royal Canadian Air Force and the United States Air Force. In 1950 the airport came under the authority of the Federal Government until February 1, 1997, when it was transferred to the City of Grande Prairie.

The terminal, built in 1981, was renovated in 2009 making it twice its original size. In 2014, one of the two asphalt runways was extended to , with the other one being . A forthcoming expansion includes an upgrade to the parking system. Currently the airport has no customs capabilities (although a temporary customs facility was set up for the 2010 Arctic Winter Games).

Swanberg Air formerly operated out of the airport until they ceased operations in 2011. They flew cargo, scheduled, and charter passenger services in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia.

=== City public transit ===
Grande Prairie Transit is a small public transit system with modern buses and a route system integrated throughout the city. In September 2023, city transit became free to anyone under the age of 18 years.
=== Intercity bus ===
Greyhound Canada offered scheduled bus service from its Grande Prairie terminal to Edmonton and Dawson Creek. This service was terminated in October 2018. Ebus connects Grande Prairie to Edmonton. Bus service to Edmonton is also provided by Cold Shot Bus Service.

=== Highways and roads ===

Highway 43 is the main east–west highway through the city providing a connection from Edmonton to the southeast through to British Columbia to the west. Highway 43 meets Highway 2 a few kilometres north of the city at the Four Mile Interchange, then continues south into the city, via the city bypass, and exits the city at the west end near the airport. The &quot;Four Mile Interchange&quot; (previously called &quot;Four Mile Corner&quot;) is an interchange so-named because it is north of Richmond Avenue (100th Avenue, at 100 street).

The short stretch of Highway 2 extending just north and just west of Grande Prairie was renumbered to Highway 43 in the late 1990s to link with the rest of Highway 43 i.e.: the Yellowhead Highway from Edmonton. The renumbering was also due to Highway 43 now being a part of the CANAMEX trade route and being widened to a four-lane divided highway.

The four lane Highway 43X bypass, skirts the northwest corner of the city from the Four Mile Interchange to Highway 43 just west of the airport. The Highway 43X bypass was completed in stages, over several years, and was fully opened to traffic in September 2019. The Highway 43X Bypass permits traffic to go around the city&#x27;s north west region, and reduces traffic on the city bypass, which was built in the 1960s, and had become fully engulfed within the city, and was somewhat congested with traffic.

Highway 40 is the primary access road into Grande Prairie from the south, and extends southward to Grande Cache, and onward to Jasper National Park. It is part of the shortest fully paved route to Alaska from the lower 48 states, so Grande Prairie sees many vacationers heading to Alaska by road during the summer via Highway 40 northward into Grande Prairie, then Highway 43 westward towards Dawson Creek, BC, which is &quot;Mile 0&quot; of the Alaska Highway.

=== Rail ===
The City of Grande Prairie has rail freight service provided by CN. Trackage runs south from Grande Prairie to Grande Cache and Hinton, where it joins CN&#x27;s main transcontinental line. CN also operates local freight service out of Grande Prairie on former Northern Alberta Railways tracks - north to Sexsmith and Rycroft, and west to Beaverlodge and Hythe.

Savage Alberta Railway, which operated from 1999 to 2006, was owned by North American RailNet and had its headquarters in the city prior to being purchased by CN.

== Education ==
=== Elementary and secondary schools ===
Four school districts operate schools within Grande Prairie.

The Grande Prairie Public School District (GPPSD) operates 18 schools.

Grande Prairie Roman Catholic Separate School District No. 28 operates ten schools within Grande Prairie.

The Peace Wapiti School Division No. 76 (PWSD) operates three schools in Grande Prairie that serve students of the surrounding County of Grande Prairie No. 1.

The Northwest Francophone Education Region No. 1 operates École Nouvelle Frontière for students in kindergarten to grade 12.

Aside from the two outreach schools that provide alternative curriculum for high school students, Grande Prairie&#x27;s high schools are the Grande Prairie Composite High School (GPPSD), St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic High School (GP&amp;DCS), Ecole Nouvelle Frontiere, Charles Spencer High School (GPPSD) and Peace Wapiti Academy (PWSD).

=== Post-secondary ===
Northwestern Polytechnic (NWP), previously known as Grande Prairie Regional College, was originally incorporated as the Grande Prairie Junior College in 1965 and opened its doors in 1966. After being renamed Grande Prairie Regional College (GPRC) in 1970, construction of the present campus began in 1973, based on a plan prepared by Canadian architect Douglas Cardinal. The first phase opened in 1974 followed by the second phase in 1991. GPRC was renamed Northwestern Polytechnic in March 2022.

Dr. Vanessa Sheane was appointed acting President and CEO in July 2023.

==Climate==
Hagi has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot, humid and wet summers combined with cool to mild winters, with a relatively high precipitation amount compared to mainland Asian locations on similar latitudes.


==Population==
One of the factors underlying the continual decrease of population is said to be its poor public transport. Industry did not grow at all and the rapid economic growth of Japan only caused the town to decline. But it also kept the traditions alive and the traditional look of the town preserved.

== History ==
The area of Hagi was part of ancient Nagato Province. During the Muromachi period, the Yoshimi clan built a minor fortification at a fishing village where the city is now located. During the Edo Period, the area was the center of Chōshū Domain, with the Mōri clan ruling as &quot;daimyō&quot; from their stronghold at Hagi Castle for 250 years. The samurai of Chōshū Domain played a major role in the Meiji restoration of the 1860s, and many leaders of the Meiji government came from this city. The Hagi Rebellion of 1876 was staged by former samurai unhappy with the changes to their status under the new regime. The town of Hagi within Abu District, Yamaguchi was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Hagi was raised to city status on July 1, 1932.

On March 6, 2005, Hagi absorbed the towns of Susa and Tamagawa, and the villages of Asahi, Fukue, Kawakami and Mutsumi (all from Abu District) to create the new, expanded city of Hagi.

==Government==
Hagi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 20 members. Hagi, collectively with the town of Abu, contributes two members to the Yamaguchi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Yamaguchi 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

===Military===
Hagi is home to the Ground Self-Defense Force&#x27;s Mutsumi Training Area, and is a proposed installation site for the Aegis Ashore missile defense system.

==Economy==
The main industries in Hagi are tourism, agriculture and commercial fishing. Industrial development has been greatly hampered by poor transportation and logistics connections, although a number of industrial parks have been established.

==Education==

Hagi has 20 public elementary schools and 14 public junior high schools operated by the city government, and two public high schools operated by the Yamaguchi Prefectural Board of Education. There are also one private junior high school and one private high school. The prefecture also operated one special education school for the handicapped. The Yamaguchi University of Human Welfare and Culture is located in Hagi.

== Transportation ==
The development of the transportation network in Hagi is the slowest in Yamaguchi Prefecture, and access to Shinkansen, expressway networks, and airports is particularly inconvenient. The nearest Shinkansen station, is about an hour away by bus, and the nearest airport, Iwami Airport in Masuda, Shimane Prefecture is also an hour away.

==Geography==
The urban center of Hikari is located on the alluvial plain of the Shimada River, and on both ends of it lies the Murozumi Coast and Nijigahama Beach, forming part of the Setonaikai National Park. The hilly area from the northern part of the city to the eastern part is the Sekishiroyama Prefectural Natural Park.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===

* Kudamatsu
* Shūnan
* Yanai

===Climate===
Hikari has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with very warm summers and cool winters. The average annual temperature in Hikari is 15.6 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1678 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around 26.2 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.6 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hikari has been relatively steady for the past 70 years.

==History==
The area of Hikai was part of an ancient Suō Province and traces of settlements dating to the Yayoi period have been found. Murozumi Bay used to be called Mitarai Bay, and was a key point for maritime traffic on the Seto Inland Sea in ancient times. The name comes from the legend that Empress Jingū washed her hands in this bay when she was on her way to conquer the Korean Peninsula. In addition, the Silla expeditionary force led by Otomo Satehiko found shelter here when it was caught in a storm. During the Edo Period, the area was part of the holdings of Chōshū Domain and prospered as a port-of-call for the &quot;kitamaebune&quot; coastal trade. Following the Meiji restoration, the villages of Mitsui, Shimada, Mii and Asae within Kumage District, Yamaguchi was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. These municipalities were merged for the town of Shunan on April 1, 1939. The town was renamed Hikari on October 1, 1940, On April 1, 1943 Hikari merged with the town of Murozumi to form the city of Hikari.

===Military===
The Hikari Naval Arsenal (or Dockyard) included a fire-control factory, built in 1942, that employed about 600 people. It was one of the principal establishments for producing the Standard H.A. System (Type 94 &quot;Kosha Sochi&quot;) at the rate of ~15 per month, along with bomb components, torpedo afterbodies, and misc. machined parts.

The Imperial Japanese Navy formed the Second Special Attack Force (former First Special Base Unit) on March 1, 1945, at Hikari for conducting &quot;kaiten&quot; attacks. Rear Admiral Nagai Mitsuru was the Commanding Officer. On that same day, a &quot;kaiten&quot; crew training unit is also formed at Hirao, SE of Hikari.
This was one of four such &quot;kaiten&quot; training bases.

With hints of cessation of hostilities, bombing raids by U.S. forces were canceled. However, resumption of bombing was ordered on August 13, 1945.
The Hikari Naval Arsenal was consequently bombed the next day on August 14, 1945 (one day before the end of war), taking 738 lives.
The attacking U.S. aircraft were 156 B-29 bombers of the 40th Bomb Group
stationed in Saipan, supported by P-51 Mustangs from Iwo Jima. 
The 40th Bomb Group dropped 3,540 bombs (885 tons) on the Hikari Naval Arsenal, resulting in severe destruction.
Including this bombing, Hikari lost more than 1,200 citizens in World War II, both military and civilian. 
After surrender, Allied forces found 52 kaiten at Hikari and destroyed them.

===Postwar===
On July 1, 1955 Hikari annexed the village of Suō. On October 4, 2004, the town of Yamato (from Kumage District) was merged into Hikari. 

The former Hikari Naval Arsenal is now the sites for Nippon Steel Corporation and vaccine manufacturing by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. Takeda discovered the hull of a Type 4 Kaiten under one of the buildings in August 1989, an attestation to the history of the site.

The Kaiten Monument, erected in 1996, honors Hikari Naval Arsenal kaiten pilots. Steel frames that once constituted the structure of the destroyed Hikari Naval Arsenal were used to build the Tsukumo Bridge.

==Geography==
Nagato is located in northwestern Yamaguchi. The north side faces the Sea of Japan, and the coastline facing the open sea is eroded terrain. On the other hand, there are coves such as Fukagawa Bay and Senzaki Bay, which are surrounded by the island of Ōmijima and the mainland, and Aburaya Bay, which is surrounded by the Mukatsugu Peninsula, which are good natural harbors. Since the Mukatsugu Peninsula has little flat land, there are many terraced rice fields. The southern part of the city is on the western edge of the Chugoku Mountains, and snow can be seen in the mountainous areas. However, due to the influence of the Tsushima Current, it does not get extremely cold even in winter, and because the altitude is not so high, the number of snowy days is not so many. Nagato also encompasses Ōmijima Island in the Sea of Japan, which is connected by a large road bridge which connects the Senzaki Peninsula with the southern edge of the island. Much of the island is within the borders of the Kita-Nagato Kaigan Quasi-National Park.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Mine was on 26 July 2018; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 3 February 2012.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Mine in 2020 is 23,247 people. Mine has been conducting censuses since 1920.
==Geology==
The plateau consists of uplifted reef limestones of Paleozoic age, which were thickened by overfolding during the Akiyoshidai orogenic movement. Subsequent erosion has created an undulating karst landscape dimpled with many dolines and countless limestone pinnacles up to two meters in height. Beneath the surface lie hundreds of caves, a few of them quite significant geologically.

Numerous fossils of Pleistocene age have been found in these caves, including those of the Japanese rhinoceros, Stegodont elephant, Naumann elephant, Young tiger, and numerous other animals from the last interglacial period.

The area around Akiyoshidai was once heavily forested about 500,000 years ago. In the Jōmon period, the area served as a hunting ground and the bottoms of sinkholes as vegetable fields. Numerous Japanese Paleolithic artifacts have been recovered. As farming began in Japan, the local people eventually replaced the forested landscape with Japanese pampas grass for feeding their animals and thatching houses. Repeated cycles of burning the grass have kept trees from growing back since.

== History ==
The area of Mine was part of ancient Nagato Province and was part of Chōshū Domain under the Edo Period Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji restoration, the area was divided into 13 villages within Mine District, Yamaguchi with the creation of the modern municipalities system. The village of Ota was raised to village status on August 1, 1923, followed by Isa on January 1, 1924 and Omine on May 1, 1939. The city of Mine was created by the merger of Isa and Omine with the villages of Ofuku, Nishiatsu and Higashiatsu on March 31, 1954. On October 1 of the same year, the town of Ota merged with the villages of Ayagi, Managata Agago to form the town of Mitō. The remainder of the district was consolidated into the town of Shūhō on April 1, 1955. On March 21, 2008, Mine absorbed Mitō and Shūhō, and the newly merged city retained the name, Mine.

==Government==
Mine has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 16 members. Mine contributes one member to the Yamaguchi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Yamaguchi 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Mine was noted from ancient times for its copper mines with the Naganobori Copper Mine supplying the copper used in the construction of the Nara Daibutsu and Nara period &quot;Wadōkaichin&quot; coins. Mine developed as an industrial city due to the production of anthracite and limestone from the Ōmine Coal Field after the Meiji Restoration. After the mines were closed, the population decreased sharply and the city has been active in attracting industrial parks.

Tourism centered on Akiyoshidai Quasi-National Park is also a major component of the local economy.

==Education==
Mine has 12 public elementary school and six public junior high schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Yamaguchi Prefectural Board of Education. There are also one private high school.

The average annual rainfall is 2128 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.8 °C, and lowest in January, at around 7.0 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Komatsushima has slowly declined over the past 60 years.

== History ==
As with all of Tokushima Prefecture, the area of Komatsushima was part of ancient Awa Province. During the Genpei War, it was the location where Minamoto no Yoshiatsu landed in Shikoku in his campaign against the Heike clan at the Battle of Yashima. During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Tokushima Domain ruled by the Hachisuka clan from their seat at Tokushima Castle. Following the Meiji restoration, the village of Komatsushima was established within Katsuura District, Tokushima with the creation of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on November 1, 1908. In April 1951, Komatsushima annexed the neighboring town of Tatsue. Komatsushima was raised to city status on June 1, 1951. The neighboring town of Sakano was annexed on September 30, 1956.

<text>Aulus Hirtius (; – 43 BC) was consul of the Roman Republic in 43 BC and a writer on military subjects. He was killed during his consulship in battle against Mark Antony at the Battle of Mutina.

==Biography==
He was a legate of Julius Caesar&#x27;s starting around 58 BC and served as an envoy to Pompey in 50. It was reported that Hirtius dined with Caesar, Sallust, Oppius, Balbus and Sulpicius Rufus on the night after Caesar&#x27;s famous crossing over the Rubicon river into Italy on 10 January 49 BC.

During Caesar&#x27;s Civil War he served in Spain; he may have been a tribune in 48, and in 47 was at Antioch. He was a praetor in 46 and governor of Transalpine Gaul in 45.

After Caesar&#x27;s assassination in March 44, Hirtius was deeply involved in the maneuvering between parties. Having been nominated for that post by Caesar, Hirtius and Pansa became consuls in 43.

Initially a supporter of Mark Antony, Hirtius was successfully lobbied by Cicero, who was a personal friend, and switched his allegiance to the senatorial party. He then set out with an army to attack Antony who was besieging Mutina. In concert with Pansa and Octavian (the future Emperor Augustus), Hirtius compelled Antony to retire but was slain in the fighting (April 21) at the Battle of Mutina. He was honored with a public funeral, along with Pansa who died a few days later.

Hirtius added an eighth book to Caesar&#x27;s &quot;De Bello Gallico.&quot; He was formerly thought to be an author of &quot;De Bello Alexandrino&quot;, though a 2018 computer-assisted stylistic analysis disproves this.

Suetonius in Chapter 68 of his &quot;Life of Augustus&quot; writes that Lucius Antonius, the brother of Mark Antony, accused Augustus of having &quot;given himself to Aulus Hirtius in Spain for three hundred thousand sesterces.&quot; This alleged homosexual liaison would have taken place in 46 BC, during the civil wars when Julius Caesar took Octavian to Spain and Aulus Hirtius was serving there. However, it is possible that this was an attempt at slander by Mark Antony, who was Octavian&#x27;s political opponent at the time. Allegations of homosexual submissiveness was a common method of political attack in the Roman Republic and it is impossible to know how much of it was true.

From the Heian period onwards, it was noted as an entry point for pilgrims to the Kotohira-gū shrine. During the Edo Period, the area developed as the castle town for Marugame Domain, which was ruled for 210 years by the Kyōgoku clan. Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Marugame was established with the creation of the modern municipality system on February 15, 1890. It was elevated to city status on April 1, 1890, becoming the 53rd city in Japan. During the 1950s the southeast area of the city and some islands were amalgamated to form new parts of the city.

On March 22, 2005, the towns of Ayauta and Hanzan (both from Ayauta District) were merged into Marugame to create the current expanded city of Marugame.
*The former Ayauta was founded in 1959 with the merger of the villages of Kumatami and Okada. Kumatama was founded by the merger of the villages of Kurikuma and Tomikuma in 1951.
*The former Hanzan was founded in 1956 with the merger of the villages of Sakamoto and Hokunji.

== History ==
The area of Higashikagawa was part of ancient Sanuki Province. From the Heian period the Hiketa port prospered as a good natural harbor and a gateway to Shikoku from the Kinai region. From the Sengoku period, Hiketa Castle was a stronghold of the Ikoma clan and a castle town developed around the fortifications. Even today, many of the intricate alleyways and old buildings from the Edo and Meiji periods still exist, preserving the atmosphere of a pre-modern fishing town. During the Edo Period, this area was part of the holdings of Takamatsu Domain. Following the Meiji restoration, the area was organized into villages within Ōchi District, Kagawa with the creation of the modern municipalities system on February 15, 1890. Hiketa was elevated to town status on October 1, 1909. The city of Higashikagawa was the result of a merger on April 1, 2003 between Hiketa and the towns of Ōchi and Shirotori, both from Ōkawa District (which was dissolved as a result of the merger).

==Geography==
Uwajima is located in southwestern Ehime Prefecture, facing the wide rias coastline and remote islands, Uwa Bay on the Seto Inland Sea to the east, and with the other three sides surrounded by mountains. Although it is actually located to the south-southeast of Yawatahama, as it is the terminus of the limited express train on the JR Shikoku Yosan Line, people other than local residents tend to think that it is the westernmost city in Ehime Prefecture.

*Matsuno
*Seiyo

* Shimanto city
* Sukumo

===Climate===
Uwajima has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is highest from June to September.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Uwajima has decreased steadily since the 1960s.

== History ==
The area of Uwajima was part of ancient Iyo Province. During the Heian period, Uwajima (notably the island of Hiburijima in Uwajima Bay) was center of piracy in the Seto Inland Sea and became the stronghold of Fujiwara no Sumitomo in his rebellion. During the Muromachi period, a branch of the Saionji family was appointed as governor of the area by the Ashikaga shogunate, but was constantly being invaded his more powerful and aggressive neighbors, including Ouchi Yoshitaka, Mōri Motonari, Ōtomo Sōrin, the Tosa-Ichijo clan and the Chōsokabe clan. The Saionji survived by the fluid loyalties and fierce resistance, but were eventually overcome by Chōsokabe Motochika, who was in turn overthrown by the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Iyo Province was given to Kobayakawa Takakage, who assigned the area around Uwajima to his adopted son and half-brother, Hidekane. Takakage was later transferred to Kyushu and was replaced by Hideyoshi&#x27;s general Toda Katsutaka. In contrast the Kobayakawa, the Toda ruled with extreme harshness, murdering the descendants of the Saiōnji family and thinking nothing of robbery, rape and murder of the local inhabitants. When ordered to send troops to the invasion of Korea in 1592, he cut down large trees in shrines and temples throughout his domain to construct ships. He went insane during the campaign, and died in Korea without heir. Hideyoshi then assigned Tōdō Takatora to the domain. A noted castle designer, Takatora spent six years building Itajima Castle, which would later be called Uwajima Castle. Following the Battle of Sekigahara and other campaigns, he was promoted to Tsu Domain in Ise Province. In 1614, Date Hidemune, the illegitimate eldest son of Date Masamune, was awarded the 100,000 &quot;koku&quot; Uwajima Domain by Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada, and moved into Uwajima Castle the following year. His descendants would rule the domain until the Meiji restoration.

Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Uwajima was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. In 1917, Maruho Village was merged into Uwajima. The town of Uwajima merged with the village of Yahata on August 1, 1921 and was raised to city status. The city was extended by combining Kushima Village in 1934 and renovating the bay area for factory usage. The center of the city was largely destroyed by bombing during World War II in 1945; however, post-war reconstruction was rapid. In 1955, Uwajima annexed Miura and Takamitsu Villages and Uwaumi village in 1974. On August 1, 2005 Uwajima absorbed the towns of Mima, Tsushima and Yoshida (all from Kitauwa District) .

==Government==
Uwajima has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 24 members. Uwajima, together with Kihoku and Matsuno, contributes four members to the Ehime Prefectural Assembly.

In terms of national politics, Uwajima is part of Ehime 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Prior to 2022, the city was part of Ehime 4th district.

==Economy==
Uwajima is the largest municipality of southwestern Ehime, but industry is poorly developed except for a single shipyard. Commercial fishing, taking advantage of the ria coastline, aquaculture and cultured pearls is the mainstay of the local economy.

The word &quot;Gaiya&quot; is in a local dialect, approximately translating to &quot;awesome&quot; in English.The city is known for bullfighting, which differs from the more widely known Spanish bullfights in that there is no matador.

<text>Vernon is a city in the Okanagan region of the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada. It is northeast of Vancouver. Named after Forbes George Vernon, a former MLA of British Columbia who helped establish the Coldstream Ranch in nearby Coldstream, the City of Vernon was incorporated on 30 December 1892. The City of Vernon has a population of 40,000 (2013), while its metropolitan region, Greater Vernon, had a population of 58,584 as of the 2011 Canadian census. With this population, Vernon is the largest city in the North Okanagan Regional District. A resident of Vernon is called a &quot;Vernonite&quot;.

==History==
The site of the city was discovered by the Okanagan people, a tribe of the Interior Salish people, who initially named the community Nintle Moos Chin, meaning &quot;jumping over place where the creek narrows&quot;. This name refers to a section of the Swan Lake that passes through Downtown Vernon, the community&#x27;s central business district. Some of these were part of the Okanagan Indian Band, a First Nations government part of the Okanagan Nation Alliance. This was followed by Priest&#x27;s Valley, which serves as an Indigenous reserve, and its present name, in honour of Forbes George Vernon, a pioneer member part of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for Yale. The Okanagan people settled around the city&#x27;s two lakes, Okanagan Lake and Swan Lake, obtaining seasonal sources of food. In that same decade, a section of a road near Fort Kamloops became its first road. Pleasant Valley Road, north of that street, was also historically developed.

In 1811, fur traders began travelling around the area. After one of these, David Stuart, began working with the Pacific Fur Company, which was bought out by the North West Company; Luc Girouard became the first white settler. However, the North West Company was forced to merge with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1821. Fur traders decided to camp in Vernon, which started to develop in 1863, following a gold discovery at the Cherry Creek, Monashee Mountains, Mission Creek and the east side of Okanagan Lake. After the development began, numerous ranches were constructed. Centreville, the community&#x27;s original central business district, was formed in 1885. That same year, a post office, hotel, general store, and school house was constructed. A Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company store was established in 1887, in a rough wooden structure. Historically a major economic hub destination in the Okanagan, Vernon was home to many cattle ranches and fruit orchard areas, attracting British families.

Vernon&#x27;s growth accelerated beginning in 1891, after the Canadian Pacific Railway was opened in the Okanagan and Shuswap regions of the British Columbia Interior, connecting in Sicamous, a town in the Shuswap area; services by this railway were offered to Vernon by 1891, in addition to its neighbourhood of Okanagan Landing. Shortly after, the sternwheeler &quot;S.S. Aberdeen&quot; was launched by the Canadian Pacific Railway for use on Okanagan Lake in 1893 connecting Vernon to Penticton at the south end of Okanagan Lake, and points between. Fruit trees were planted in Vernon, which first grew by the early 1890s, while water supplies were shipped to the community by canal in 1906 for use at local orchard or farm areas. In 1908, the Okanagan Mounted Rifles military program was formed in it, thus bringing a number of people to the area during World War I and World War II for lessons.

Vernon was incorporated as a city on 30 December 1892, with a city hall formed in 1903 for the governing body, which included a fire hall and a public reading space. The following year, it was declared the largest municipality in the Okanagan and first of which to contain a bank and telephone. As population expanded, more services were made available at Vernon, while its city centre switched from Coldstream Road to 30th Avenue. A school and Vernon Jubilee Hospital were public services made available in 1909. Despite a growth drop during World War I, citizens voted to open a new high school, sports stadium, and, later, a shopping mall, Village Green Centre, and library, in the city.

==Transportation==
Three provincial highways connect Vernon: Highway 97 which connects north–south (south to Kelowna, north to Kamloops); Highway 97A which begins in Vernon, and goes north to Armstrong and Enderby; and Highway 6 which ends in Vernon running east–west to Lumby. In recent years, each of these highways has undergone major renovations, including a new $22-million interchange system and four lane expansion at the Highway 97 and Highway 6 junction.

The City of Vernon, in conjunction with the District of Coldstream and the North Okanagan Regional District, operates Vernon Regional Transit through BC Transit. This transit system is responsible for all local full-service and handyDART public bus transportation. Ebus, a sister brand for the luxury transportation company Red Arrow, also serves Vernon for out-of-town destinations from their downtown bus terminal.

Vernon is served by the Vernon Regional Airport (IATA: YVE, ICAO: CYVK) in the Okanagan Landing area. The airport has no scheduled air service, and is primarily used by civilian aircraft. The Greater Vernon area is also served by Kelowna International Airport, located approximately 40 kilometres (about a 30 to 40 minute drive) south on Hwy 97. Numerous airlines provide scheduled passenger and cargo services to points throughout British Columbia and Alberta, and areas beyond such as Toronto and Seattle.

Charles Bloom Secondary is in the town of Lumby, which is about 20 minutes East of Vernon on Highway 6. Competitions are common among the schools, with all of them taking part in annual grad pranks as well as healthy sports competitions. Vernon is home to few independent schools such as the Vernon Christian School, which has both an elementary (preschool-grade 6) and secondary campus with a middle school (grades 7-9) and high school (grades 10-12).
For post-secondary education, Vernon is home to Okanagan College, a multi-campus full degree granting college. Many summer courses and yearly courses are offered there. Other smaller community and specialty colleges exist within Vernon.

==Arts and culture==
Each winter, Vernon plays host to the Vernon Winter Carnival. First held in 1961, it is now Western Canada&#x27;s largest and North America&#x27;s second largest Winter Carnival.

Sunshine festival is an annual event held in the Downtown core of Vernon. This event features live music, artisan booths, community program booths, food trucks, and children&#x27;s entertainment.

Vernon is also home to the Vernon and District Performing Arts Centre. The society presents three series of entertainment including dance, theatre, and child oriented. The performing arts centre also hosts hundreds of touring musical acts, local talent and community based events.

The city is also home to the 60 year old Powerhouse Theatre, which is housed in a former power station. The theatrical society of Powerhouse Theatre operates on a seasonal basis and is largely reliant on the coordinated efforts by passionate volunteers.

Vernon&#x27;s Towne Cinema is the home of The Vernon Film Society and is a classic example of a 1930s Art Deco style theatre. Built in 1929–30, the Towne Cinema began its life as The National Ball Room, presenting live entertainment on stage, hosting banquets and stage plays. It was the main venue in Vernon for entertaining the troops during the Second World War and was heavily involved in selling war bonds and the collection of aluminum from its customers for the war effort. Children could bring an old aluminum pot or pan and receive a ticket for a free movie, the aluminum going towards the construction of war planes and other military materials so necessary for the achievement of victory over the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler.

The Vernon Community Arts Centre (VCAC) is located in Polson Park. This community centre is a studio-based facility and is operated by the Arts Council of the North Okanagan. The VCAC offers year-round programming for youth and adults such as art classes and workshops, an artist in residence program and independent study sessions.

Every Summer in June, Vernon hosts the largest craft show in western Canada, called Creative Chaos. Artisans from across western Canada gather to sell their original handmade goods and services: jewellery, chocolates and candies, unique clothing, and other household items and/or decorations. A food fair and entertainment are also a feature of this craft fair. The fair usually lasts three days and many of the citizens of Vernon partake.

Vernon displays a variety of public art from murals to sculptures and mosaics. A collection of 28 heritage murals was created under the direction of lead artist Michelle Loughery. The mural project is in a continual state of growth, with new pieces of art being added at regular intervals. One of the most notable murals is a depiction of Sveva Caetani, daughter of Italian noble Leone Caetani. She was an Italian immigrant who survived captivity by her mother to become a famed artist and local art instructor.

In 2016, Canada&#x27;s first inclusive memorial sculpture was installed on the grounds of Vernon Secondary School.

==Sports and recreation==

Vernon is known for its lakes and beaches in the summer, and skiing and hockey in the winter. It is therefore a year-round tourist destination and weekend getaway for people from Vancouver and Calgary. During the summer Vernon hosts a large slo-pitch tournament (Funtastic).

The Vernon area is home to several golf courses. Among these is the prestigious Predator Ridge Resort, a 36-hole golf resort and community. This resort is one of only two public golf courses in Western Canada to have been ranked by Score Magazine as one of the country&#x27;s top 25 golf courses over the last 8 years. Predator Ridge Resort also hosted the Skins Game twice - first in 2000 featuring Fred Couples, Sergio García, Phil Mickelson, and Mike Weir, then in 2008 featuring Mike Weir, Fred Couples, Greg Norman, Colin Montgomerie and Camilo Villegas.

One of the most popular winter sports in Vernon is skiing. With two major ski locations nearby located in Regional District of North Okanagan Electoral Area C, each winter locals and tourists alike flock to Silver Star Mountain Resort and Sovereign Lake Nordic Club. Known as one of the top ski resorts in North America, Silver Star also has a large cross-country skiing area which hosted a 1991 FIS Cross-Country World Cup event. As another world-class ski area, Sovereign Lake is the region&#x27;s premier cross-country skiing location with over 50 kilometers of skiing terrain. This Nordic Club gained worldwide exposure as the host of a 2005 FIS Cross-Country World Cup event.

Curling also has a strong following in Vernon, with local curlers being found at the Vernon Curling Club. In past years, the city has hosted several major national curling events, including the 1979 Canadian Senior Women&#x27;s Curling Championship, the 1992 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, and the 2004 Canadian Senior Curling Championships. Its first international event, the 2008 Ford World Women&#x27;s Curling Championship was held at the Vernon Multiplex.

Another popular sport in Vernon is tennis, with many courts in picturesque locations. The Vernon Tennis Association (VTA) was started in October 2008 to bring together tennis players of all skill levels within the Vernon area and to offer both competitive and social programs that are not being offered currently to players. Presently the VTA operates programs 15 hours per week in &quot;partnership&quot; with Greater Vernon Parks, Recreation and Culture.

A more recent sport with growing popularity is pickleball. The Vernon Pickleball Association was incorporated in 2014, and currently has more than 500 members. It recently spearheaded a campaign to construct a roof over its pickleball complex of 12 courts, which will facilitate year-round playing when it opens early 2021.

Kalamalka Beach (Kal Beach) is the most popular of many unique beaches in and around Vernon. A large pier built by a local service club is used for sunbathing and jumping. On summer evenings the beach is used extensively for beach volleyball. Kin Beach and Paddle Wheel Park Beach on Okanagan Lake are also among the twenty or so larger beaches in Vernon.

Vernon has several areas for mountain biking including Ellison Provincial Park, Kalamalka Lake Park, Sovereign Lake Provincial Park, Predator Ridge, and Silver Star Mountain.

Cougar Canyon is near Vernon, with both a popular rock climbing site and an ecological preserve. Another place for cliff jumpers and campers is Ellison Provincial Park, located about 15–20 minutes out of South Vernon.

The city is home to Splashdown Vernon.

Vernon has also seen success in junior hockey. The Vernon Vipers (formerly the Vernon Lakers) are one of the most decorated junior teams in Canadian history having won the Royal Bank Cup (formerly the Centennial Cup) six times, with four of those wins in the 1990s. They won while hosting the tournament in 1990, repeated in 1991, again in 1996, in 1999 and most recently won back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010; giving arguably the most dominant performance of any franchise in a single decade since the introduction of the Centennial Cup in 1971. To date, the Vernon Vipers have won 4 Royal Bank Cups, 2 Centennial Cups, 4 Abbott Cups, 5 Doyle Cups, 8 Mowat Cups and 9 League Titles.

The Vernon Tigers Junior B Lacrosse Club was established in 2000, coinciding with the inception of the Thompson Okanagan Junior Lacrosse League. Since that time, they have won three league titles and two provincial silver medals.

==Governance==

In 2019 Vernon city council decided to install free-standing toilets, which can be &quot;used by all community members&quot;, with specific design features to prevent it being used inappropriately.

Council had originally considered purchasing a pair of &quot;Portland loos&quot;, for $275,000. That design that had been installed in dozens of cities, but, due to the long waiting list, Vernon decided to commission a similar facility from local suppliers.

The local design was installed on time, and at a lower cost than that projected for the Portland Loo. However, it needed a bit of work, as it did not function on opening day. Like the Portland Loo, the toilet designed for Vernon is built from stainless steel and is painted with special paint designed to counter graffiti. Like the Portland Loo there is no washbasin inside, only a toilet, and a dispenser for waterless hand cleanser. Slats allow police enough visual access to confirm there is only one occupant.

Requests for new toilets were first brought to council by the Activate Safety Task Force, in 2018. Initially Vernon planned to leave the facility open 24 hours a day, as is done with almost every city that has installed a Portland Loo, but, in the end, Council decided the facility will only be open from 7am to 9pm.

If the new facility proves satisfactory, toilets like it will replace the public toilets near the city&#x27;s bus station.

==Flag==

The flag of Vernon was adopted in November 2010 after it had been flown in Afghanistan by Canadian Forces members, including Gareth Eley, a seaman from the city, who returned the flag when it was adopted. It was presented to the mayor at a service member flag program, Home Flags Project, by Eley, in addition to a number of other municipal flags, in Vernon at the Wesbild Centre sports stadium during Remembrance Day ceremonies. The mayor stated it displays the &quot;rich&quot; history of this city to the public.

Vernon City Council declared they would frame and display the flag at Vernon City Hall at this time. There is a crest and shield version of the flag of Vernon that is used occasionally; it was adopted shortly after the city was incorporated. The flag of Vernon represents the city itself and its region, the Okanagan, containing a &quot;V&quot; to note Vernon, an elk to represent the wildlife of the area, sheaves to suggest the importance of agriculture in the city, while its horn of plenty notes its fruit industry.

<text>is a city in Ehime Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 106,016 in 58,803 households and a population density of 210 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Saijō is in central Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku and is bordered by the Seto Inland Sea to the north. It sits at the base of Mount Ishizuchi, the tallest peak in western Japan. The consolidated city of Saijō encompasses a broad area, spreading out across the entire Dōzen Plain from the foothills of the Ishizuchi Mountain Range to the Seto Inland Sea (the former Saijō City, Tōyo City, Komatsu Town and Tanbara Town), and also contains smaller communities extending into the lower reaches of the mountains. The Dōzen Plain is crossed by several rivers, the largest being the Kamo River and the Nakayama River.

The main city of Saijō is known for natural spring water. Signs throughout the city and at the city&#x27;s train station call Saijō the &quot;Spring Water Capital of Japan.&quot; Numerous fountains, known locally as &quot;uchinuki&quot;, are scattered throughout the city where water is frequently bottled by locals and visitors alike. Most private dwelling houses also drill private wells to take advantage of the water. A famous freshwater spring known as &quot;Kōbōsui&quot;, named for Kūkai (also known as Kōbō-Daishi), gushes from the bottom of Saijō harbor and is visited by locals and Buddhist pilgrims alike to drink and worship.

===Origin of name===
The first appearance of the name Saijō in written record is a letter from third Kamakura Shōgun Minamoto no Sanetomo recognizing the jurisdiction over the region of the Kōno clan that was included in the &quot;Yoshōki&quot;, a history of the clan written centuries later. Some regional historians such as Yuzuru Yamauchi challenge the veracity of that document, arguing that the first reliably datable extant document referring to Saijō is from the end of the Kamakura period. The etymology of the name Saijō itself is unclear. One possible origin suggested in extant documents from Kikō-ji Temple in Niihama is that the region was once divided into a &quot;western district&quot; (the literal meaning of Saijō) and an eastern district (Tōjō, now Niihama) by the small group of mountains that lie between the two cities. The most common narrative follows this interpretation and attributes both the name and the geographical boundaries of Saijō to the Taika Reforms of the 7th century, though this origin has been disputed for lack of concrete historical evidence.

===Climate===
Saijō has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light snowfall. The average annual temperature in Saijō is 14.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1839 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in January, at around 25.3 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.0 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Saijō has remained relatively steady since the 1960s.

===Language===
Residents of Saijō speak the Tōyo (eastern Ehime) variation of the Iyo dialect, which is part of the Western Japanese language group and similar in many ways to Kansai dialect. Due to some local variations in the dialect, people in Saijō refer to their particular form of Tōyo dialect as Saijō dialect (&quot;Saijō-ben&quot;).

==History==

===Prehistory===
The Saijō area was part of ancient Iyo Province and has been inhabited at least as early as the Jōmon period, as evidenced by earthenware dated to approximately 6000 BC discovered in the Ichikura highland region. A large number of artifacts dating to the middle and late Yayoi period have been unearthed on and around Mount Hachidō. The significant clustering of burial mounds from the later Kofun period in the highlands has led archaeologists to believe that the flat plain on which modern Saijō sits was either too cold or too close to the Seto Inland Sea for tomb construction.

===Medieval to Early Modern===
The history of the region from the Kamakura period to the beginning of the Edo period is difficult to piece together, in part because much of the area was destroyed as a result of Kobayakawa Takakage&#x27;s campaign to subdue Iyo Province during the Invasion of Shikoku.

At the beginning of the Kamakura period, the shogunate established the powerful Kōno clan as governors (&quot;shugo&quot;) over the entire Iyo Province, including Saijō. The Kōno had long held power over the region as manorial lords of the Saijō area. However, in 1342, Ashikaga Takauji ordered the invasion of Iyo Province by the subordinate Hosokawa clan as part of a bid to consolidate the shogunate&#x27;s power over all of Shikoku. The Hosokawa clan assumed control over a large portion of the area that would last until the Warring States Period, and Saijō was ruled by proxy by the Ishikawa clan from Takakogi Castle in the present day Sunouchi district.

During the tumult of the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Saijō was ruled by a series of lords until the establishment of Saijō Domain in 1636. Hitotsuyanagi Naomori was appointed lord of this domain, but died of illness in Osaka on the way to his new fiefdom. His successors ruled for two generations until attainder of the domain by the shogunate in 1665 for political reasons including a peasant rebellion. In 1670 the shogunate installed Matsudaira Yorizumi, a grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu, whose descendants ruled for 10 generations until the Meiji Restoration.

The geography of Saijō underwent great changes during the Edo period. The second Hitotsuyanagi ruler, Naoshige, built Saijō Castle and diverted the Kita River to create a moat. The former castle grounds now house Saijō High School, one of a few public schools in Japan contained within a moat and castle gate. Flood control projects for the Kamo River and land reclamation from the Seto Inland Sea began during the end of the Warring States Period and continued through the Edo Period, with major reclamation projects undertaken by the Matsudaira family as a means to increase their personal land holdings, 20000 &quot;koku&quot; of which were lost when they were reassigned to Saijō.

===Modern===
After the Meiji Restoration, Saijō Domain and adjacent Komatsu Domain became Saijō Prefecture and Komatsu Prefecture, respectively, in 1871. That same year, both prefectures were absorbed by the new Matsuyama Prefecture, which would be renamed Ishizuchi Prefecture before being combined with Kamiyama Prefecture to form the current Ehime Prefecture in 1873. The area was divided into villages within Nii District, Ehime with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on December 15, 1889. The town of Saijō was created with the merger of the villages of Tamatsu (玉津村), Omachi (大町村), and Kansai (神拝村) on February 11, 1925. On April 29, 1941, Saijō merged with the villages of Iioka (飯岡村), Kanbe (神戸村), Tachibana (橘村) and the town of Himi (氷見町) and was raised to city status.

On November 1, 2004, Saijō absorbed the city of Tōyo, and the towns of Komatsu and Tanbara (both from Shūsō District) were create the new and expanded city of Saijō.

In 2004, Saijō experienced its worst typhoon season on record. A series of typhoons struck from August to the end of September, with Typhoon 21 (September 28–29) causing 5 deaths and 5.9 billion yen in damage. The typhoons hit the mountain communities hardest, exacerbating the gradual aging and depopulation trends of these areas. The scale of the 2004 disaster was attributed to twin factors of a lack in public disaster awareness mechanisms and environmental issues such as concrete dams and deforestation. In response to the disaster, Mayor Kōtarō Itō established a Public Safety Division in 2006 and began a partnership with the Kyoto University Graduate Environmental Studies Department in 2007 to help make the city better prepared for emergencies. Programs instituted since then include “Town Watching” and mandatory sixth-grade disaster preparedness education. Both of these programs have created ties between Saijō and the city of Hue in Vietnam, which has implemented them.

==Government==
Saijō has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 28 members. Saijō contributes four members to the Ehime Prefectural Assembly.

In terms of national politics, Saijō is part of Ehime 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Prior to 2022, the city was part of Ehime 3rd district.

==Economy==
As the extended Saijō area comprises mountain forests, farmland, and coastline, the city has a diverse economy.

Logging was the major industry in the mountains Ōfuki village region, and the population of the area swelled during the postwar construction boom until the 1960s, when a shift to foreign lumber imports decimated the local industry. The accompanying population decline was severe, and the average age in Ōfuki as of 2011 is 67. In addition to logging, mining was also a major part of the mountain economy. The nearby Ichinokawa Mine was founded at the beginning the Edo period and was a major source of antimony until its closure due to lack of economic viability in 1957. Large stibnite crystals taken from the mine are on display both in Saijō and in museums all over the world. The mine was controlled for generations by the Sogabe family before being purchased in the Showa period by the Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., which also managed the nearby Besshi copper mine. All that remains of the mine complex today is a sealed-off stone gateway leading to one of the larger mine shafts.

In contrast to the decline of mountain-based industries in the middle of the Showa period, agriculture and coastal industries grew consistently through the economic boom period before experiencing some decline after the beginning of the recession in 1991. In 1964, Saijō was designated the &quot;New Tōyo Industrial Development City&quot;, accompanied by increased coastal reclamation projects and the development of heavy industry. This allowed the Saijō port industrial zone to compete with the already developed Tōyo City and Niihama City coastal chemical industries. Asahi Breweries opened a manufacturing plant in the main port area in 1996. The Imabari Shipbuilding Company maintains a shipyard in Saijo. The company&#x27;s 800-t cranes are among the largest of their kind in the world and are a major visual landmark. The coastal area of Saijō forms the largest industrial zone in Shikoku, and covers a wide variety of fields, including materials, semiconductors, shipbuilding, beverages, power generation, and steel. The value of industrial shipments from Saijō is larger than that of Kochi Prefecture as a whole.

Away from the coastline, Coca-Cola operates its Shikoku bottling plant in Komatsu. Panasonic Healthcare had a factory in the Iioka area that closed in 2013.

The Saijo Plain in the center of the city, which is located downstream of the Kamo and Nakayama river systems, is known as a breadbasket, with production flowers, vegetables, and fruit trees, making it one of the leading agricultural areas in Ehime Prefecture. Saijō&#x27;s farms and orchards produce many varieties of crops, and the region is particularly known for producing the herbs used in the traditional spring porridge nanakusa-no-sekku, eggplant, roses, persimmons, and spinach. The Japan Agricultural (JA) Group operates several permanent farmers&#x27; markets in the Saijō region.

==Education==
Saijō has 26 public elementary schools and ten public middle schools operated by the city government. The city has five public high schools operated by the Ehime Prefectural Board of Education.

===Festivals===
Saijō is famous for its three fall festivals, held annually from October 14–17, which feature over 100 hand-carried wooden floats known as &quot;danjiri&quot; or &quot;taikodai&quot; (depending on the festival) that belong to neighborhood associations across the city. These floats are up to 5 meters tall and weigh between 600 and 800 kilograms. The festivals have been celebrated since the Edo period.

Saijō&#x27;s festivals are known as the Iwaoka Shrine Festival (Oct. 14–15), Isono Shrine Festival (Oct. 15–16), and Iizumi Shrine Festival (Oct. 16–17), with the largest number of &quot;danjiri&quot; (over 80) taking part in the Isono Shrine Festival. The Isono Shrine Festival begins at midnight of the 15th with a ceremony at Isono Shrine inviting a god into the portable shrine known as the &quot;Goshinyō&quot;, after which the &quot;danjiri&quot; and four two-wheeled &quot;mikoshi&quot; roam the city for two days. The float-bearers wear traditional outfits and sing a local variation of the &quot;Ise Ondo&quot;, signifying the region&#x27;s historical relationship to Ise Grand Shrine in Mie Prefecture. The festival ends with the &quot;kawa-iri&quot;, where the &quot;Goshinyō&quot; and 11 &quot;danjiri&quot; are carried into the Kamogawa River while the other floats keep watch from the bank.

The main shrine is situated at the base of the mountain, and there are shrines on the summit and near the landing of the Ishizuchi Ropeway. Constructed to venerate the mountain itself, the Ishizuchi cult dates back to the Nara period. The main shrine was built in the Meiji period after the shinbutsu bunri (the state enforced separation of Shinto and Buddhism) caused nearby Maegami-ji Temple to lose its status as headquarters for Ishizuchi worship. Ishizuchi Shrine holds a 10-day ceremony and festival beginning on July 1 to mark the official opening of climbing season.

The average annual rainfall is 1644 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.1 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.6 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ōzu has decreased steadily since the 1960s.

==History==
The area of Ōzu was part of ancient Iyo Province. During the Sengoku period, it was part of the holdings of Tōdō Takatora, who constructed Ōzu Castle on top of a previous fortification dating to the Kamakura period. In 1608, he was transferred and replaced by the Wakizaka clan, followed in 1617 by the Katō clan, who ruled the 66,000 &quot;koku&quot; Ōzu Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. Ōzu developed in the Edo period as a castle town. The town of Ōzu was established within Kita District, Ehime with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on December 15, 1889. During the Meiji and Taishō periods (late 19th century, early 20th century), Ōzu saw great economic expansion due to thriving silk and Japanese wax candle (和蠟燭, &quot;warōsoku&quot;) industries. A robust timber trade also occurred during this time, with Hiji River serving as a transportation artery. However, transformations brought by the arrival of railways and motorways disrupted the balance of the local economic cycle. 

On September 1, 1954, town of Ōzu merged with the villages of Hirano (平野村), Awazu (粟津村), Miyoshi (三善村), Kamisukai (上須戒村), Minamikume (南久米村), Sugeta (菅田村), Niiya (新谷村), Yanagisawa (柳沢村) and Ōkawa (大川村) to form the city of Ōzu . On January 11, 2005 Ōzu annexed neighboring Nagahama, Hijikawa, and Kawabe municipalities.

==Government==
Ōzu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 21 members. Ōzu, together with the town of Uchiko contributes two members to the Ehime Prefectural Assembly. 

In terms of national politics, Ōzu is part of Ehime 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Prior to 2022, the city was part of Ehime 4th district.

==Economy==
Ōzu was once noted for its production of electronics; however, its factory by Matsushita Kotobuki Electronics closed in 2010 due to rapid deterioration in business performance. The economy is now centered on Agriculture (vegetables, livestock, citrus fruits) and forestry, with manufacturing of toothbrushes an important local product.

==Education==
Ōzu has 20 public elementary schools and nine public middle schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Ehime Prefectural Board of Education. The city also has one private middle school and two private high schools.

==Local attractions== 
Ōzu&#x27;s flourishing silk and wax industries brought great wealth and prosperity, particularly at the turn of 20th century. Refinement and cultural discernment followed suit. This resulted in a thriving urban environment of various historical layers, remnants of which are still standing:

-Garyū Sansō (臥龍山荘) Set of three tea pavilions within a lavish roji (路地) -tea ceremony garden- overhanging the Hiji River. Built by silk and tea trade champion Torajiro (河内 寅次郎, Kōuchi Torajiro) as a personal retreat. It doubled as a Noh Theatre stage and was berth of the local &quot;&quot; (懸け造り) architecture style.

Its Zen meditation hall displays a Siddhattha Gotama (釈迦如来像, Shakanyorai-zō) sculpture, flanked by elevated tatami, a rather unusual setting in &quot;zazen&quot; (座禅) dedicated spaces .

==History==
Iyo is part of ancient Iyo province. While archaeological artifacts show that the Iyo area has been settled since at least as far back as the Yayoi period (300 BC to 250 AD), the origins of the present city of Iyo can be traced back to the year 1635, when the Matsuyama han ceded the territory including Iyo to the Ōzu Domain. The port at Gunchū, the heart of present-day Iyo, became the main commercial port for Ōzu Domain and the surrounding community flourished. The town of Gunchū was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on December 15, 1889.

<text>Cap-de-la-Madeleine () is a former city in Quebec, Canada at the confluence of the Saint-Maurice River and the St. Lawrence River. It was amalgamated into the City of Trois-Rivières in 2002. Population (2006 census) 33,022.

== History ==
Cap-de-la-Madeleine was founded March 20, 1651. The establishment was named by Jacques de La Ferté, who was abbot of Sainte-Madeleine de Châteaudun in France.

The city is famous for its basilica, Basilique Notre-Dame du Cap, dedicated to Our Lady of the Cape. The Basilica receives thousands of pilgrims and visitors each year. Pilgrims are drawn to the site because it is considered to be the place where two miracles were performed by the Blessed Virgin Mary, the first being the Miracle of the Ice Bridge (1879) and the other being the Miracle of the Eyes (1888). The first official pilgrimage occurred in 1883 and consisted of roughly 150 people who travelled to the location by foot. The site is considered the first pilgrimage site in North America, excluding Mexico.

During World War II the Royal Canadian Air Force built and operated No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan in Cap-de-la-Madelaine. The school opened on October 14, 1940 and closed on February 11, 1944. The airfield was located in what is now a residential area near rue Saint Maurice and rue de Grandmont ()

The inhabitants call themselves Madelinois and Madelinoise.

==Other interesting sites==
*Fort Saint-François: built 1660 and late abandoned with no visible traces remaining on what is now Notre dame du Cap Sanctuary
*Fort du Moulin-à-Vent: built between 1649 and 1653; now a residential area

==Notable people from Cap-de-la-Madeleine==

* Jean-Guy Talbot (1932–2024), hockey player (NHL) and coach
* Charles Thiffault (born 1939), NHL ice hockey coach

<doc id="329398" wikidata="Q747372" url="?curid=329398" title="Greater sage-grouse">
<text>The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), also known as the sagehen, is the largest grouse in North America. Its range is sagebrush country in the western United States and southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. It was known as simply the sage grouse until the Gunnison sage-grouse was recognized as a separate species in 2000. The Mono Basin population of sage grouse may also be distinct.

The greater sage-grouse is a permanent resident in its breeding grounds but may move short distances to lower elevations during winter. It makes use of a complex lek system in mating and nests on the ground under sagebrush or grass patches. It forages on the ground, mainly eating sagebrush but also other plants and insects. Greater sage-grouse do not have a muscular crop and are not able to digest hard seeds like other grouse.

The species is in decline across its range due to habitat loss, and has been recognized as threatened or near threatened by several national and international organizations.

==Description==
Adult greater sage-grouse have a long, pointed tail and legs with feathers to the toes. The adult male has a yellow patch over each eye, is grayish on top with a white breast, and has a dark brown throat and a black belly; two yellowish sacs on the neck are inflated during courtship display. The adult female is mottled gray-brown with a light brown throat and dark belly. Adult males range in length from 26 to 30 inches and weigh between 4 and 7 pounds. Adult females are smaller, ranging in length from 19 to 23 inches and weighing between 2 and 4 pounds.

==Distribution and habitat==
Greater sage-grouse are obligate residents of the sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia&quot; spp.) ecosystem, usually inhabiting sagebrush-grassland or juniper (&quot;Juniperus&quot; spp.) sagebrush-grassland communities. Meadows surrounded by sagebrush may be used as feeding grounds. Use of meadows with a crown cover of silver sagebrush (&quot;A. cana&quot;) is especially important in Nevada during the summer.

Greater sage-grouse occur throughout the range of big sagebrush (&quot;A. tridentata&quot;), except on the periphery of big sagebrush distribution. Greater Sage-Grouse prefer mountain big sagebrush (&quot;A. t.&quot; ssp. &quot;vaseyana&quot;) and Wyoming big sagebrush (&quot;A. t.&quot; ssp. &quot;wyomingensis&quot;) communities to basin big sagebrush (&quot;A. t.&quot; ssp. &quot;tridentata&quot;) communities.

Sagebrush cover types other than big sagebrush can fulfill greater sage-grouse habitat requirements; in fact, the grouse may prefer other sagebrush cover types to big sagebrush. Greater sage-grouse in Antelope Valley, California, for example, use black sagebrush (&quot;A. nova&quot;) cover types more often than the more common big sagebrush cover types. Hens with broods on the National Antelope Refuge in Oregon were most frequently found (54–67% of observations) in low sagebrush (&quot;A. arbuscula&quot;) cover. Desert shrub habitat may also be used by greater sage-grouse.

Sagebrush communities supporting greater sage-grouse include silver sagebrush and fringed sagebrush (&quot;A. frigida&quot;).

Their historic range spanned 16 American states and Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan in Canada. Between 1988 and 2012, the Canadian population declined by 98%. By 2012, they were extirpated from British Columbia and left with only remnant populations in Alberta with 40 to 60 adult birds, and in Saskatchewan with only 55 to 80 adult birds. By 2013, sage grouse were also extirpated from five U.S. states. In 2013, the Canadian Governor in Council on behalf of the Minister of the Environment, under the Species at Risk Act, annexed an emergency order for the protection of the greater sage-grouse.

==Ecology==

===Lek mating system===
Greater sage-grouse are notable for their elaborate courtship rituals. Each spring, males congregate in leks and perform a &quot;strutting display&quot;. Groups of females observe these displays and select the most attractive males with which to mate. The dominant male located in the center of the lek typically copulates with around 80% of the females on the lek. Males perform in leks for several hours in the early morning and evening during the spring. Video
Males gather in leks to court, usually in late February to April. Only a few dominant males, usually two, breed. Sage grouse mating behaviors are complex. After mating, the hen leaves the lek for the nesting grounds.

Open areas such as swales, irrigated fields, meadows, burns, roadsides, and areas with low, sparse sagebrush cover are used as leks. Of 45 leks, 11 were on windswept ridges or exposed knolls, 10 were in flat sagebrush, seven were in bare openings, and the remaining 17 were on various other site types. Leks are usually surrounded by areas with 20 to 50% sagebrush cover, with sagebrush no more than tall. Daily morning lek attendance by male Sage grouse can vary considerably between years, with lower attendance on days with precipitation.

===Nest selection===
Greater sage-grouse disperse to areas surrounding the leks for nesting. In a study of habitat selection by male greater sage grouse in central Montana during breeding season, sagebrush height and canopy cover at 110 daytime feeding and loafing sites of cocks were recorded. About 80% of the locations occurred in sagebrush with a canopy cover of 20–50%. In another Montana study, sagebrush cover averaged 30% on a cock-use area, and no cocks were observed in areas of less than 10% canopy cover.

Some females probably travel between leks. In Mono County, California, the home range of marked females during one month of the breeding season was , enough area to include several active leks. DNA from feathers dropped at leks showed that about 1% of grouse may travel long distances to explore breeding areas up to 120 miles away, a type of long-distance dispersal that can potentially boost populations and temper inbreeding.

Within a week to ten days following breeding, the hen builds a nest in the vicinity of the lek. Hens usually nest near the lekking grounds, but some hens have been noted to fly as far as to favorable nesting sites. 

Quality of nesting habitat surrounding the lek is the most important factor in population success. Adequacy of cover is critical for nesting. Too little can exist: where 13% was the average total crown cover on Idaho range, nests were located where average cover was 17%. No hens nested in the most arid, open areas with less than 10% total shrub cover. Too much also can occur: average shrub cover at 87 nest sites was 18.4%, and in more dense cover, greater sage-grouse did not nest where total shrub cover was greater than 25%. In Utah, no nests occurred where threetip sagebrush cover exceeded 35%.

Sagebrush forms the nesting cover for most greater sage-grouse nests throughout the West, with concealment being the basic requirement. Rabbitbrush (&quot;Chrysothamnus&quot; spp.) is occasionally used for nesting cover with greasewood (&quot;Sarcobatus vermiculatus&quot;) and shadscale (&quot;Atriplex canescens&quot;) being rarely used.

Greater sage-grouse prefer relatively tall sagebrush with an open canopy for nesting. In Utah, 33% of 161 nests were under silver sagebrush that was tall, while big sagebrush of the same height accounted for 24% of nests. In a threetip sagebrush (&quot;A. tripartata&quot;) habitat averaging 8 in (20 cm) in height, hens selected the tallest plants for nesting cover. Similarly in Wyoming, 92% of nests in Wyoming big sagebrush were in areas where vegetation was tall and cover did not exceed 50%.

In Montana, when sagebrush characteristics around 31 successful and 10 unsuccessful nests were compared, successful nests had greater than average sagebrush cover surrounding the nest and were located in stands with a higher average canopy cover (27%) than unsuccessful nests (20%). The average height of sagebrush cover over all nests was as compared to an average height of in adjacent areas.

During the nesting season, cocks and hens without nests use &quot;relatively open&quot; areas for feeding, and roost in &quot;dense&quot; patches of sagebrush.

===Brood rearing===
Clutch size ranges from six to eight eggs; incubation time is 25 to 27 days. Greater sage-grouse apparently have high rates of nest desertion and nest predation. Data from several sage grouse studies indicate a range of nesting success from 23.7 to 60.3%, with predation accounting for 26 to 76% of lost nests.

Chicks are precocial and can feed themselves. They fly by two weeks of age, although their movements are limited until they are two to three weeks old. They can sustain flight by five to six weeks of age. Juveniles are relatively independent by the time they have completed their first molt at 10 to 12 weeks of age.

==Diet==
===Adults===
The importance of sagebrush in the diet of adult greater sage-grouse is great; numerous studies have documented its year-round use. A Montana study, based on 299 crop samples, showed that 62% of total food volume of the year was sagebrush. Between December and February, it was the only food item found in all crops. Only between June and September did sagebrush constitute less than 60% of their diet. Sage grouse select sagebrush species differentially. Greater sage-grouse in Antelope Valley, California, browsed black sagebrush more frequently than the more common big sagebrush. The browse of black sagebrush is highly preferred by greater sage-grouse in Nevada. In southeastern Idaho, black sagebrush was preferred as forage.

Among the big sagebrush subspecies, basin big sagebrush is less nutritious and higher in terpenes than either mountain or Wyoming big sagebrush. Sage grouse prefer the other two subspecies to basin big sagebrush. In a common garden study done in Utah, greater sage-grouse preferred mountain big sagebrush over Wyoming and basin big sagebrush.

Sage grouse lack a muscular gizzard and cannot grind and digest seeds; they must consume soft-tissue foods. Apart from sagebrush, the adult diet consists largely of herbaceous leaves, which are used primarily in late spring and summer. Additionally, greater sage-grouse use perennial bunchgrasses for food.

Sage grouse are highly selective grazers, choosing only a few plant genera. Dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum&quot; spp.), legumes (Fabaceae), yarrow (&quot;Achillea&quot; spp.) and wild lettuce (&quot;Lactuca&quot; spp.) account for most of their forb intake. From July to September, dandelion comprised 45% of forb intake; sagebrush comprised 34%. Collectively, dandelion, sagebrush, and two legume genera (&quot;Trifolium&quot; and &quot;Astragalus&quot;) contributed more than 90% of the greater sage-grouse diet. Insects are a minor diet item for adults. Insects comprised 2% of the adult diet in spring and fall and 9% in summer. Sagebrush made up 71% of the year-round diet.

===Females before laying===
Herbaceous dicots are used heavily by females before egg laying and may be essential for their nutrition because of their high protein and nutrient content.

Favored foods of prelaying and brood-rearing greater sage-grouse hens in Oregon are common dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot;), goatsbeard (&quot;Tragopogon dubius&quot;), western yarrow (&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot;), prickly lettuce (&quot;Lactuca serriola&quot;), and sego lily (&quot;Calochortus macrocarpus&quot;).

===Juveniles===
In their first week of life, greater sage-grouse chicks consume primarily insects, especially ants and beetles. Their diet then switches to forbs, with sagebrush gradually assuming primary importance. In a Utah study, forbs composed 54 to 60% of the summer diet of juveniles, while the diet of adult birds was 39 to 47% forbs.

A Wyoming study evaluated effects of eliminating insects from the diet of newly hatched greater sage-grouse chicks. All chicks hatched in captivity and not provided insects died between the ages of 4 and 10 days, whereas all chicks fed insects survived the first 10 days. Captive chicks required insects for survival until they were at least three weeks old. Chicks more than three weeks old survived without insects, but their growth rates were lowered significantly, indicating insects were still required for normal growth after three weeks of age. As quantity of insects in the diet increased, survival and growth rates also increased up to 45 days, the length of the experiment.

In a study conducted in Idaho, Klebenow and Gray measured food items for juvenile greater sage-grouse for each age class, classes being defined by weeks since birth. In the first week, insects were very important – 52% of the total diet. Beetles, primarily family Scarabaeidae, were the main food item. Beetles were taken by all other age classes of chicks, but in smaller amounts. All ages fed upon ants, and while the volume was generally low, ants were found in most of the crops. After week 3, insect volume dropped and stayed at a lower level throughout all the age classes, fluctuating but always under 25%.

With plants like common dandelion and goatsbeard, all aboveground parts of the plant were sometimes eaten. The stems, however, were not of main importance. The reproductive parts, mainly buds, flowers, and capsules, were the only parts taken from some of the other species. Conversely, leaves were the only parts of sagebrush found in the crops. Leaves and flowers of the species listed above and other dicots contained higher amounts of crude protein, calcium, and phosphorus than sagebrush and may be important in greater sage-grouse diets for these reasons.

===Water===
Greater sage-grouse apparently do not require open water for day-to-day survival if succulent vegetation is available. They use free water if it is available, however. Their distribution is apparently seasonally limited by water in some areas. In summer, greater sage-grouse in desert regions occur only near streams, springs, and water holes. In winter in Eden Valley, Wyoming, they have been observed regularly visiting partially frozen streams to drink from holes in the ice.

==Predators==
Predators are commonly believed to reduce greater sage-grouse populations and of most importance is timing of death. Nest loss to predators is most important when potential production of young and recruitment are seriously impacted. Lack of adequate nesting and brooding cover may account for high juvenile losses in many regions. Nest success is related to herbaceous cover near the nest site. Taller, more dense herbaceous cover apparently reduces nest predation and likely increases early brood survival. Although predators were the proximate factor influencing nest loss, the ultimate cause may relate to the vegetation available to nesting grouse. Tall, dense vegetation may provide visual, scent, and physical barriers between predators and nests of ground-nesting birds. Greater amounts of both tall grass and medium-height shrub cover were associated collectively with a lower probability of nest predation. In a series of Nevada studies, artificial nest predation experiments were conducted. Artificial nests experienced 100% mortality with the loss of 1,400 eggs in 200 simulated nests in two weeks in one study, 84% of the nests were destroyed in three days in another study, while just 3% of the nests were destroyed in 10 days in an area of significantly better cover.

Generally, quantity and quality of habitats used by greater sage-grouse control the degree of predation, so predation would be expected to be most important as habitat size and herbaceous cover within sagebrush decreases. A decline in preferred prey may also result in increased predation on greater sage-grouse. In southeastern Oregon, a decline in black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;) numbers may have caused predators to switch to greater sage-grouse as their primary prey.

Predator species include coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), American badgers (&quot;Taxidea taxus&quot;), falcons (Falconidae), and hawks and eagles (Accipitridae sp.) prey on adult and juveniles. Crows and ravens (&quot;Corvus&quot; sp.) and magpies (&quot;Pica&quot; sp.) consume juvenile birds. Coyotes, ground squirrels (Sciuridae spp.), and badgers are the most important mammalian nest predators. Among bird species, magpies and ravens commonly prey on Greater Sage-Grouse nests.

Greater sage-grouse are a popular game bird. Mortality due to hunting is generally considered to be compensatory and replacive, where until mortality reaches a &quot;threshold value&quot;, it has no effect on population levels. Data are not available to suggest that closed or restricted hunting seasons will materially affect overall population levels on their primary range.

In a study on hunting in a low-density greater sage-grouse population in Nevada, low populations may be a result of factors other than hunting. Protecting one greater sage-grouse population from hunting while doubling the birds harvested in a four-year period on another population showed, despite low recruitment, both populations increased to nearly the same density. In an Oregon study, no relationship was found between the rate of summer recruitment (chicks/adult) and harvest by hunters, nor was any significant relationship found between the size of the fall harvest and population trends during the subsequent spring.

==Conservation==
Residential building and energy development have caused the greater sage-grouse population to decline from 16 million 100 years ago to between 200,000 and 500,000 today.

This species is in decline due to loss of habitat; the bird&#x27;s range has shrunk in historical times, having been extirpated from British Columbia, Kansas, and Nebraska. Though the greater sage-grouse as a whole is not considered endangered by the IUCN, local populations may be in serious danger of extinction. In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the subspecies &quot;Centrocercus urophasianus phaios&quot;, formerly found in British Columbia, as being extirpated in Canada. The presence of subfossil bones at Conkling Cave and Shelter Cave in southern New Mexico show that the species was present south of its current range at the end of the last ice age, leading some experts to project that the species could become increasingly vulnerable as global climate change increases the humidity in semiarid regions.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the species was a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act, but the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) was forced by the US Congress to not grant endangered species status in September 2015.

The original petition to list the greater sage-grouse was mailed to the USFWS in June, 2002 by Craig Dremann of Redwood City. Dremann, for his petition, quoted a Department of Interior document about the declining status of the bird, putting the USFWS in the difficult position of having to argue against another Federal agency&#x27;s findings. The reason why Dremann sought the listing, is after driving across the bird&#x27;s range in 1997, and noting what vegetation grew at each post mile, from California to South Dakota and back, recorded how damaged and destroyed the native sagebrush understory habitat had become from lack of management of the grazing of public lands.

The following groups have supported Dremann&#x27;s petition to list: American Lands Alliance, Biodiversity Conservation Alliance, Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Native Ecosystems, WildEarth Guardians, the Fund for Animals, Gallatin Wildlife Association, Great Old Broads for Wilderness, Hells Canyon Preservation Council, The Larch Company, The Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides, Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, Oregon Natural Desert Association, Oregon Natural Resources Council, Predator Defense Institute, Sierra Club, Sinapu, Western Fire Ecology Center, Western Watersheds Project, Wild Utah Project, and Wildlands CPR.

In 2010, after a second review, the Department of the Interior assigned the greater sage-grouse a status known as &quot;warranted but precluded&quot;, essentially putting it on a waiting list (behind more critically threatened species) for federal protection.

Since half of all remaining sage grouse habitat is on private lands, the USDA&#x27;s Natural Resources Conservation Service launched the Sage Grouse Initiative, a partnership-based, science-driven, Farm Bill-funded effort that uses voluntary incentives to proactively conserve America&#x27;s western rangelands, wildlife, and rural way of life. The Sage Grouse Initiative has partnered with 1,500+ ranchers across 11 states since 2010, conserving 5.5 million acres of sage grouse habitat (twice the size of Yellowstone National Park).

In April 2014, the Sage-Grouse and Endangered Species Conservation and Protection Act (H.R.4419) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives to prohibit the federal government from listing sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act for 10 years, as long as states prepare and carry out plans to protect the species within their borders.

Facing a court-ordered deadline of October 2015, the Department of the Interior on September 22, 2015, was forced by the US Congress just before the deadline, by adding language in the 2015 Appropriations bill to stop the listing, not to list the bird as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The language in the 2015 bill, &quot;Prohibits funds from being used to write or issue rules pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and related to the sage-grouse.&quot;

As rationale for its decision, the Department said it would rely on a new land-management plan to protect the sage grouse&#x27;s habitat of 165 million acres across eleven Western states. The designation under the ESA would likely have led to land-use and other restrictions that critics feared would have economic impacts, possibly restricting oil and gas development and homebuilding. In issuing its finding, the FWS stated that:

This measure was repeated in the 2016 appropriations bill. For the 2017 bill, the Columbia Basin population was added — Sec. 114:
 
For the 2018 appropriations bill, over the objections of conservationists and the Democratic party, Congress applied similar measures to two other species: the gray wolf and the lesser prairie chicken.

Despite the Department of the Interior&#x27;s decision not to list the greater sage-grouse as threatened or endangered, legal efforts to protect the sage-grouse continue. For instance, in May 2016 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a planned wind energy project in Harney County, Oregon could not proceed until the Bureau of Land Management adequately studied whether the project site provided winter habitat for sage-grouses.

On December 6, 2018, the government announced a plan to roll back protections for the sage grouse to open nine million acres of land to wind and solar farms, drilling, mining, and cornfields for the production of government mandated ethanol.

=== Canada ===
The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) designated the greater sage-grouse as &quot;Threatened&quot; in 1997, and re-designated the species as &quot;Endangered&quot; in April 1998. The status was reevaluated and confirmed in May 2000 and April 2008. The greater sage-grouse is listed on Schedule 1 of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Species at Risk Act&quot;, as &quot;Endangered&quot;.

In 2013, the Canadian Governor in Council on behalf of the Minister of the Environment, under the Species at Risk Act, annexed an emergency order for the protection of the greater sage-grouse. This order, among other things, prohibits killing of sagebrush plants, native grasses, or native forbs, and the building of fences and other structures in certain areas. The order is implemented &quot;to protect a listed wildlife species on both federal and non-federal lands when the competent Minister is of the opinion that the species faces imminent threats to its survival or recovery.&quot;In 2014, a ten-year captive breeding program for greater sage-grouse was initiated at the Calgary Zoo. Despite only two of thirteen hatched birds surviving to the age of seven months, the program will proceed.

==In popular culture==
A sage-grouse, Cecil the Sagehen, is the mascot of the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens, the joint athletics program of Pomona College and Pitzer College, two liberal arts colleges in Claremont, California.

<text>In geometry, a solid of revolution is a solid figure obtained by rotating a plane figure around some straight line (the &quot;axis of revolution&quot;), which may not intersect the generatrix (except at its boundary). The surface created by this revolution and which bounds the solid is the &quot;surface of revolution&quot;.

Assuming that the curve does not cross the axis, the solid&#x27;s volume is equal to the length of the circle described by the figure&#x27;s centroid multiplied by the figure&#x27;s area (Pappus&#x27;s second centroid theorem).

A representative disc is a three-dimensional volume element of a solid of revolution. The element is created by rotating a line segment (of length ) around some axis (located units away), so that a cylindrical volume of units is enclosed.

==Finding the volume==
Two common methods for finding the volume of a solid of revolution are the disc method and the shell method of integration. To apply these methods, it is easiest to draw the graph in question; identify the area that is to be revolved about the axis of revolution; determine the volume of either a disc-shaped slice of the solid, with thickness , or a cylindrical shell of width ; and then find the limiting sum of these volumes as approaches 0, a value which may be found by evaluating a suitable integral. A more rigorous justification can be given by attempting to evaluate a triple integral in cylindrical coordinates with two different orders of integration.

===Disc method===

The disc method is used when the slice that was drawn is &quot;perpendicular to&quot; the axis of revolution; i.e. when integrating &quot;parallel to&quot; the axis of revolution.

The volume of the solid formed by rotating the area between the curves of and and the lines and about the -axis is given by
formula_1
If (e.g. revolving an area between the curve and the -axis), this reduces to:
formula_2

The method can be visualized by considering a thin horizontal rectangle at between on top and on the bottom, and revolving it about the -axis; it forms a ring (or disc in the case that ), with outer radius and inner radius . The area of a ring is , where is the outer radius (in this case ), and is the inner radius (in this case ). The volume of each infinitesimal disc is therefore . The limit of the Riemann sum of the volumes of the discs between and becomes integral (1).

Assuming the applicability of Fubini&#x27;s theorem and the multivariate change of variables formula, the disk method may be derived in a straightforward manner by (denoting the solid as D):
formula_3

===Shell Method of Integration ===

The shell method (sometimes referred to as the &quot;cylinder method&quot;) is used when the slice that was drawn is &quot;parallel to&quot; the axis of revolution; i.e. when integrating &quot;perpendicular to&quot; the axis of revolution.

The volume of the solid formed by rotating the area between the curves of and and the lines and about the -axis is given by
formula_4
If (e.g. revolving an area between curve and -axis), this reduces to:
formula_5

The method can be visualized by considering a thin vertical rectangle at with height , and revolving it about the -axis; it forms a cylindrical shell. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is , where is the radius (in this case ), and is the height (in this case ). Summing up all of the surface areas along the interval gives the total volume.

This method may be derived with the same triple integral, this time with a different order of integration:
formula_6

==Parametric form==
When a curve is defined by its parametric form in some interval , the volumes of the solids generated by revolving the curve around the -axis or the -axis are given by
formula_7

Under the same circumstances the areas of the surfaces of the solids generated by revolving the curve around the -axis or the -axis are given by
formula_8

This can also be derived from multivariable integration. If a plane curve is given by formula_9 then its corresponding surface of revolution when revolved around the x-axis has Cartesian coordinates given by formula_10 with formula_11. Then the surface area is given by the surface integral 
formula_12 

Computing the partial derivatives yields
formula_13
formula_14
and computing the cross product yields 
formula_15
where the trigonometric identity formula_16 was used. With this cross product, we get
formula_17
where the same trigonometric identity was used again. The derivation for a surface obtained by revolving around the y-axis is similar.

== Polar form ==
For a polar curve formula_18 where formula_19 and formula_20, the volumes of the solids generated by revolving the curve around the x-axis or y-axis are
formula_21

The areas of the surfaces of the solids generated by revolving the curve around the -axis or the -axis are given
formula_22

<doc id="329401" wikidata="Q1154053" url="?curid=329401" title="Progressive Field">
<text>Progressive Field is a baseball stadium in the downtown area of Cleveland, Ohio. It is the ballpark of the Cleveland Guardians of Major League Baseball and, together with Rocket Arena, is part of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex. It was ranked as MLB&#x27;s best ballpark in a 2008 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; fan opinion poll.

The ballpark opened as Jacobs Field in 1994 to replace Cleveland Stadium, which the Guardians, then known as the Indians, had shared with the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League. Since 2008, the facility has been named for Progressive Corporation, which purchased naming rights for $58 million over 16 years. The previous name came from team owners Richard E. and David H. Jacobs, who had acquired naming rights when the facility opened. The ballpark is still often referred to as &quot;The Jake&quot; based on its original name. The ballpark and arena are funded mainly by the passage of a sin tax in 1990 and both are owned by the Gateway Economic Development Corporation of Greater Cleveland, which is an appointed board of elected officials from the city of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. 

When it opened, the listed seating capacity was 42,865 people and between 1995 and 2001 the team sold out 455 consecutive regular-season games. Modifications over the years resulted in several moderate changes to the capacity, peaking at 45,569 in 2010. As of 2024, the official seating capacity is listed at 34,631 people, making it the smallest MLB stadium by total maximum capacity, though additional fans can be accommodated through standing room areas and temporary seating. 

Since moving to Progressive Field, the Guardians have won 12 Central Division titles, three American League pennants and have hosted playoff games in 13 different seasons. In the 1997 season, it became one of the few facilities in baseball history to host the MLB All-Star Game and games of the World Series in the same season. The stadium has hosted games of the World Series three times in 1995, 1997, and 2016.

==History==
The Cleveland Indians previously played home games at Cleveland Stadium, which they shared with the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League. The Indians first played at the stadium, which seated around 78,000 people for baseball, for the 1932 and 1933 seasons, but returned to smaller League Park for most games in 1934. From 1937 to 1946, they played weekend and holiday games at Cleveland Stadium, and eventually night games and other dates where larger crowds were expected, moving to the stadium full-time in 1947. Cleveland Stadium was the largest stadium in the American League during its tenure as a baseball facility and was the largest stadium in Major League Baseball for all but a few seasons. It had been a symbol of the Indians&#x27; glory years of the 1940s and 1950s, attracting some of the largest crowds in baseball history. However, during the team&#x27;s lean years from the 1960s through the early 1990s, even crowds of 40,000 people were swallowed up in the cavernous environment. As a result, the Indians began pressing for a new stadium.

Plans for a new stadium first began in 1984 when Cuyahoga County voters defeated a property tax for building a 100% publicly funded domed stadium, which would have been shared by the Indians and Browns. Later that year, committee leaders met to re-evaluate these plans, and a location was later agreed upon. The eventual site of the stadium, the location of the Central Market, was acquired in December 1985. In April 1986, designs for the new stadium were agreed upon and about a year later, demolition at the site started. Cuyahoga County voters approved a 15-year sin tax on alcohol and cigarette sales in May 1990 to finance the new Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex, which included the ballpark, Gund Arena (now Rocket Arena) for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association, and two parking garages. Construction started in January 1992, and by May of that year, the concrete construction had been poured. In June 1992, Mel Harder, who pitched the opening game at Cleveland Stadium in 1932, and contemporary stars Charles Nagy and Sandy Alomar Jr., executed the ceremonial first pitch at the site of the new ballpark before construction began. The installation of seating was completed in October 1993. The ballpark, which was referred to as &quot;Cleveland Indians Baseball Park&quot; and &quot;Indians Park&quot; on blueprints, cost approximately $175 million to build, of which $91 million was provided by Indians owner Richard Jacobs. The remaining $84 million was raised by the sin tax. 

An open house was held April 1, 1994, and the following day, an exhibition game was held against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The first official game was held April 4. U.S. President Bill Clinton threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and the Indians defeated the Seattle Mariners 4–3 in 11 innings in front of a crowd of 41,459 people. The ballpark was the first new major sporting facility to open in Cleveland since Cleveland Arena opened in 1937. During that inaugural and strike-shortened 1994 season, the Indians finished 35–16 at home, which included an 18-game home winning streak.

The ballpark hosted playoff games for the first time in 1995 as the Indians ended a 41-year playoff drought. The first playoff game was on October 3, a 5–4 win in 11 innings over the Boston Red Sox in Game 1 of the American League Division Series. Jacobs Field also played host to Games 3, 4, and 5 of the American League Championship Series against the Seattle Mariners and Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1995 World Series against the Atlanta Braves. Two years later, Jacobs Field hosted its first All-Star Game and the first All Star Game in Cleveland since 1981. Later that year, the Indians hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1997 World Series against the Florida Marlins. It was the tenth time in Major League history the All-Star Game and games of the World Series were played in the same facility in the same season, and the first time since 1977. The longest home run in ballpark history was hit by Jim Thome on July 3, 1999, measured at to center field.

During the eighth inning of Game 2 of the 2007 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees on October 5, a swarm of insects believed to be midges from Lake Erie, enveloped the playing field, severely distracting Yankees relief pitcher Joba Chamberlain, which caused him to walk outfielder Grady Sizemore, who later scored the tying run on a wild pitch. The incident became known as the &quot;Bug Game&quot;; however, this was not the first time the insects plagued Jacobs Field.
In 2007, the Indians became the first American League team to install solar panels on their stadium. They also spent $1.1 million to convert a picnic area behind the center field fence into &quot;Heritage Park&quot;, which features 27 plaques honoring the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame and 38 bricks, representing the team&#x27;s most memorable moments. There is also a memorial plaque commemorating Ray Chapman which was originally installed at League Park. This area is shielded by plantings so it does not interfere with the batter&#x27;s eye. The Indians installed a corkscrew-shaped wind turbine from Cleveland State University above the southeast corner of the ballpark in late March 2012, the first major league team to do so. The corkscrew–shaped wind turbine was successful in generating more electricity than individual turbines and was originally scheduled to be tested for two years, but had to be removed in late March 2013 because of cracks that had developed in the off-season.

===2014–15 renovations===
The team announced the first phase of renovation plans for the ballpark, by then known as Progressive Field, in late 2014, which were completed prior to the start of the 2015 season. The area on either side of the right field gate, previously known as &quot;Gate C&quot;, was reconfigured, with a pedestrian bridge and concession buildings removed to open the views of the surrounding neighborhood. The statue of Jim Thome was moved to the area, while the statue of Bob Feller was moved to a new location in the area, and a new statue of Larry Doby was added. A two-story bar named &quot;The Corner&quot; was built, providing better views of the field as the Batter&#x27;s Eye Bar was often overcrowded. The bullpens, which had previously been separate, were relocated to the right center field area, allowing fans closer views of players warming up. To allow more light in the right field concourse, the mezzanine deck was reduced by several rows to open the area. The Kid&#x27;s Clubhouse was made two stories, and adults are now able to view the game from the clubhouse. Seating in the upper deck behind right field and down the first base line was removed and replaced with terraces, available for use by large groups. Additional changes included installation of new concession areas and options, many of which are from Cleveland-area eateries.

Prior to the start of the 2016 season, the next phase of renovations was completed, which included the addition of a new club area behind home plate for season ticket holders, the installation of a new scoreboard system and additional scoreboards, new standing room areas in the left field area, and additional concession areas, again using local-based eateries.

The ballpark became the 11th MLB facility to have LED field lights installed, which was done prior to the start of the 2017 season. Wi-Fi was also installed throughout the ballpark prior to the start of the 2017 season. As a result of these renovations, Progressive Field was awarded the 2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, marking the second time the All-Star game was played at this venue.

===2023–2025 renovations===

In 2022, an agreement was made to renovate the stadium for $200 million, with most of the cost falling on taxpayers. Renovations began after the 2023 Major League Baseball season, and are expected to take until after the 2025 season to complete.

==Attendance records==
Progressive Field set a new MLB record between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001, in selling out 455 straight games. Demand for tickets was so great that all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate seasons. The Indians retired the number 455 in honor of the sellout record. The Boston Red Sox later surpassed this record when Fenway Park recorded 456 straight sellouts on September 9, 2008. The record for the largest attendance at Progressive Field was set in Game 3 of the 1997 ALDS when 45,274 people attended the game. On Saturday, April 2, 2011, the Indians&#x27; lowest attendance record was broken with a very small crowd of 9,853, and again the following day with an even smaller attendance figure of 8,726.

==Naming rights==

Naming rights were acquired in 1994 by team owner Richard E. Jacobs, who paid for rights until the end of 2006. The Jacobs Field name gave rise to the nickname &quot;The Jake&quot; for the ballpark.

The Indians announced on January 11, 2008, that naming rights to the park had been purchased by Progressive Corporation, a major insurance company headquartered in the nearby suburb of Mayfield, for $58 million over 16 years through 2024. 

Removal of the iconic Jacobs Field sign on the front of the building began the morning of January 18, and the replacement sign was installed on March 25. Progressive agreed to pay $57.6 million for the naming rights for 16 years.

Naming rights for Progressive were extended on April 3, 2024 for an additional 12 years until at least 2036, with an option to extend by 5 years to 2041 if the current lease on the ballpark was extended.

==Operations==
The Indians extended their lease agreement with the Gateway Economic Development Corporation in August 2008 from 2013 to 2023. The agreement gives the team four five-year renewal options after 2023. As part of the renovations announced in early 2022, the Guardians signed a new lease agreement extending their tenancy to 2036 with an optional 10-year extension. As of 2023, the ballpark&#x27;s annual repairs, funded by taxpayers, have been more than $18 million per year.

==Design==

The ballpark was designed by Populous, which was then a division of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK) known as HOK Sport. HOK designed it as the second retro-style and first retro-modern ballpark, with asymmetrical fences of varying heights, a smaller upper deck, and stepped tiers. It is similar to HOK&#x27;s Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, which opened two years earlier and was the first retro-style ballpark. The ballpark was sited to give a favorable view of Cleveland&#x27;s downtown skyline. The structural engineering was done by a Cleveland company, Osborn Engineering, which helped design League Park, Cleveland Municipal Stadium, &quot;Old&quot; Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park. It was designed to blend in with the city of Cleveland with its exposed steel design and the vertical light towers that match the smoke stacks of Cleveland&#x27;s industrial zone.

==Features==

The ballpark has numerous unique structural features. The field is situated on of Kentucky Bluegrass. It is illuminated by 19 white vertical light towers; three behind the scoreboard, six behind first base, six behind third base and four in right field, which stand above street level and above the playing field and are said to resemble oversized toothbrushes. The distinctive light towers were incorporated into a version of the original Jacobs Field logo and the 1997 MLB All-Star Game logo.

The park features distinctive dimensions; left and right field are both from homeplate, but left field has a high wall, known as the &quot;Little Green Monster&quot;. The center and right field walls are high. The park features traditional hunter green seats angled at 8-12° on three tiers around the park except for center field which has one short row of seating in front of the bullpens, and left field which uses bleachers.

The bullpens, reconfigured between the 2014 and 2015 seasons, are raised above the playing field, which allows fans to see pitchers warming up. Both bullpens are located adjacent to section 103 behind right-center field, with the Guardians&#x27; bullpen closer to the field. The Guardians&#x27; dugout is along the third base line and the visitors&#x27; dugout is located along the first base line. When the ballpark was built, it contained 121 luxury boxes. A remodel and renovation between the 2014 and 2015 seasons removed six of them for a new total of 115, the second most in Major League Baseball.

==Seating capacity==
==Amenities==

A new children&#x27;s play area named &quot;Kids Clubhouse&quot;, located on the mezzanine level, opened in May 2012. It includes arts and crafts areas, a climbing wall, a mini field where children can practice sliding and fielding, a batting cage, as well as large windows where adults can watch the game from the Kids Clubhouse.

== Other events ==
===Hockey===
On January 15, 2012, the park hosted its first ice hockey game, a match between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Michigan Wolverines, the first outdoor college hockey game in Ohio.

===Concerts===
Progressive Field is occasionally used as a concert venue. It was first used for a concert on August 12, 1995 during its second season of use, when Jimmy Buffett played at the ballpark as part of his Domino College Tour. The panels set on the outfield grass to hold the stage, however, caused visible damage to the playing surface, leading Indians owner Richard Jacobs to ban concerts at the facility. Concerts returned to the ballpark in 2011 when the Indians hosted the Indians Music Festival, which featured Brad Paisley and Blake Shelton. Three years later, in 2014, Jason Aldean played at Progressive Field as part of his Burn It Down Tour, a performance that drew 40,516 fans and included Florida Georgia Line, Miranda Lambert, and Tyler Farr. In 2017, the ballpark hosted two concerts on consecutive nights, with Billy Joel performing on July 14 as part of Billy Joel in Concert, followed the next night by Luke Bryan and his Huntin&#x27;, Fishin&#x27; and Lovin&#x27; Every Day Tour. On July 30, 2022, Elton John performed before a sold-out crowd at Progressive Field as part of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.

===&quot;Snow Days&quot;===
An event called &quot;Snow Days&quot; debuted at Progressive Field in November 2010. The first day, called &quot;Snopening Day&quot;, was held on November 26 and the event continued until January 2, 2011. An ice skating track called the &quot;Frozen Mile&quot; was installed around the warning track, the &quot;Batterhorn&quot; was a snow tubing hill on the bleachers and other events were staged around the field and home run porch. &quot;Snow Days&quot; returned on November 25, 2011, and closed on January 16, 2012. The Batterhorn was moved to the Toyota Home Run porch and the Frozen Mile was rerouted. The park also added the &quot;Frozen Diamond&quot;, an ice rink covering the infield. 

The second &quot;season&quot; of Snow Days would be the last, due to low attendance that was at least partially attributed to Cleveland&#x27;s warmest winter on record, with temperatures of on &quot;Snopening Day&quot;.

==Geography==
Muroto is located in the southeastern tip of Kōchi Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. It occupies Cape Muroto which juts out into the Pacific Ocean. Parts of the city are within the borders of the Muroto-Anan Kaigan Quasi-National Park. The entire territory of Muroto is &quot;Muroto Global Geopark&quot; which is a member of the Japanese Geoparks Network and Global Geoparks Network since 2011 on account of its outstanding geological heritage, educational programs and projects, and promotion of geotourism.

===Geology===
Cape Muroto is made up of Oligocene to Pleistocene-aged sedimentary rocks and loose Holocene-aged alluvial deposits. The rocks belong to the Shimanto Supergroup, represented in the peninsula as mudstone, and the Tonohama Group made up of chiefly of sandstone and gravel. Several active, WNW-dipping, thrust faults are exposed at the western coast and southern tip of the peninsula. Off-shore west of the Cape Muroto, tip of the peninsula, there faults dips to the west.

There are uplifted marine terraces at Muroto. Dating of these terraces reveal that since their formation in an interval 123 to 96 thousand years ago (k B.P.), in an epoch corresponding to the Eemian interglacial. Since then land in the tip of the peninsula has risen 1.2–1.6 meters every thousand years (m/kyr). Closer to the mainland the uplift rate has been in the order of 0.3–0.7 m/kyr. While these are long-term averages individual large non-megathrust earthquakes are known to have uplifted the coast around one meter. These earthquakes are more rare than megathrust ones occurring every 1000 to 2000 years. Uplift of the coast has left fossil tube worm colonies attached to rocks on land.

==In popular media==
Susaki&#x27;s official mascot is Shinjo-kun, a Japanese river otter wearing a hot pot ramen dish for a hat. Japanese river otter is an extinct variety of otter, that was last documented in the mouth of the Shinjo River in Susaki.

Susaki has hit the worldwide press due to an unofficial mascot, also an otter, named Chiitan. Chiitan is somewhat violent, but in a humorous way. John Oliver has an episode discussing the humor of Chiitan. In May 2019, Chiitan was banned from Twitter for inflammatory content. There is speculation that this disturbing but amusing content can help the city of Susaki, either by attracting tourists or because Japanese can donate a portion of their taxes to cities where they are not resident.

===Cape Ashizuri===
The 70 km coastline stretching from the northeast to southwest boundaries of Tosashimizu attracts over 800,000 tourists to Tosashimizu each year. Ashizuri-Uwakai National Park includes Ashizuri, the largest peninsula in the area. Tosashimizu is the nearest city to Ashizuri peninsula which is protruding into the Pacific Ocean. Cape Ashizuri is 80 meters above sea level at the southeastern end on the peninsula. The peninsula is covered by subtropical plants including camellia, holm oak, and colony of Livistona &quot;Livistona chinensis&quot;, and the sea is a prime fishing ground for katsuo fish, or skipjack tuna &quot;Katsuwonus pelamis&quot;. While there are small islands to the south of it, the cape is recognized as the southernmost location on Shikoku island at .

===Birthplace of Nakahama Manjirō===
On the western shore of Ashizuri peninsula, lies the village of Nakanohama within Tosashimizu, where Nakahama Manjirō was born and became one of the first Japanese to travel to the United States. Manjirō, a young fisherman, was shipwrecked off the coast of Japan in 1841 and rescued by whaling captain William H. Whitfield of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Whitfield brought the young Manjirō back to Fairhaven and New Bedford at the end of the whaling voyage, and Manjirō spent several years there before eventually making his way back to Japan. Because of this history, Tosashimizu became the sister city of both Fairhaven and New Bedford in 1987. He became popular as John Manjirō after Ibuse Masuji depicted him in his novel &quot;John Manjiro. The Castaway: His Life and His Adventures&quot;.

===Wildlife tours===
There are several wildlife tours popular on Ashizuri peninsula; wildlife swims are organized in the town of Iburi on the foot of Ashizuri peninsula.

<text>Moose Jaw is the fourth largest city in Saskatchewan, Canada. Lying on the Moose Jaw River in the south-central part of the province, it is situated on the Trans-Canada Highway, west of Regina. Residents of Moose Jaw are known as Moose Javians. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Moose Jaw No. 161.

Moose Jaw is an industrial centre and a critical railway junction for the area&#x27;s agricultural produce. CFB Moose Jaw is a NATO flight training school and is home to the Snowbirds, Canada&#x27;s military aerobatic air show flight demonstration team. Moose Jaw also has a casino and geothermal spa.

== History ==
Cree and Assiniboine people used the Moose Jaw area as a winter encampment. The Missouri Coteau sheltered the valley and gave it warm breezes. The narrow river crossing and abundant water and game made it a good location for settlement. Traditional native fur traders and Métis buffalo hunters created the first permanent settlement at a place called &quot;the turn,&quot; at present-day Kingsway Park, also known as the Kai Gauthier Park.

The confluence of the Moose Jaw River and Thunder Creek was chosen and registered in 1881 as a site for a division point for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), whose construction was significant in the Confederation of Canada. The water supply there was significant for steam locomotives. Settlement began there in 1882, and the city was incorporated in 1903. The railways played an important role in the early development of Moose Jaw, with the city having both a Canadian Pacific Railway Station and a Canadian National Railway Station. A dam was built on the river in 1883 to create a year-round water supply.

Marked on a map as Moose Jaw Bone Creek in an 1857 survey by surveyor John Palliser, two theories exist regarding how the city was named. The first is it comes from the Plains Cree name &quot;moscâstani-sîpiy&quot; meaning &quot;a warm place by the river&quot;, indicative of the protection from the weather the Coteau range provides to the river valley containing the city and also the Plains Cree word &quot;moscâs&quot;, meaning warm breezes. The other is that the section of the Moose Jaw River that runs through the city is shaped like a moose&#x27;s jaw.

There is also an untrue story of the name being inspired by the Earl of Dunmore, for whom Dunmore, Alberta is named, repairing his cart with the jawbone of a moose during his travels there.

The city was the site of the 1954 mid-air collision of Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 9.

=== Military presence ===
The area surrounding Moose Jaw has many cloudless days, making it a good site for training pilots. The Royal Canadian Air Force under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan established RCAF Station Moose Jaw in 1940. After the war, the RCAF remained in the community and used the facility for training pilots through the Cold War. The facility changed its name to CFB Moose Jaw in 1968 and is now Canada&#x27;s primary military flight training centre and the home of 431 (Air Demonstration) Squadron (aka the &quot;Snowbirds&quot;).

CFB Moose Jaw&#x27;s primary lodger unit is &quot;15 Wing&quot;. In the Royal Canadian Air Force, the lodger unit is often called 15 Wing Moose Jaw. The base usually holds an Armed Forces Day each year.

The Saskatchewan Dragoons is a reserve armoured regiment with an armoury in the city&#x27;s north end.

== Royal presence ==

Many members of the Royal Family have visited Moose Jaw. Edward, Prince of Wales, who owned a ranch in Pekisko, Alberta, visited in 1919, 1924, and 1927. Prince Albert, future king and father of Queen Elizabeth II, paid a visit in 1926. King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth (later known as Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother) visited during the Royal tour in 1939. Queen Elizabeth II first visited in 1959 and returned on multiple separate occasions.

During his time as Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward became Colonel-in-Chief of the Saskatchewan Dragoons of Moose Jaw on visiting Saskatchewan in 2003 when he congratulated the regiment on its &quot;contribution to Canada&#x27;s proud tradition of citizen-soldiers in the community.&quot; Involved in peacekeeping operations in Cyprus, the Golan Heights, Bosnia and Croatia, the regiment has also provided aid during floods and forest fires in the prairies. The Prince returned to visit his regiment in 2006.

Prince Edward also inaugurated the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Rose Garden in Moose Jaw on his 2003 visit. Other royal connections to the city include King George School and Prince Arthur Community School, both named for royal family members before they shut down and combined to become Cornerstone Christian School. Additionally, the South Hill school was formerly named King Edward Elementary School.

Following the death of Queen Elizabeth in 2022, an opinion piece in the &quot;National Post&quot; noted that the late monarch had &quot;visited Moose Jaw more often than she did Manhattan. The former was part of her realms; the latter not. She was the Queen of Canada and chose to exercise that duty and serve her people over the perquisites of her position.&quot;

==Climate==
Moose Jaw&#x27;s climate is transitional between semiarid and humid continental (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot; and &quot;Dfb&quot;, respectively). Moose Jaw&#x27;s winters are long, cold and dry, while its summers are short but very warm and relatively wet. The coldest month is January, with a mean temperature of , while the warmest is July, with a mean temperature of . The driest month is February, in which an average of of precipitation falls, while the wettest month is July, which brings an average of . Annual average precipitation is .

The highest temperature recorded in Moose Jaw was on 5 July 1937. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 4 February 1907.

==Government==
Moose Jaw City Council consists of an elected mayor and six city councillors. From 1881 to 1903 the community was represented by a Town Council and after that by City Council.

Moose Jaw City Hall, on the 2nd floor at the old Moose Jaw Post Office (c. 1911), has been the council&#x27;s home since the late 1960s

Provincially, the city is represented by two MLAs and federally by one MP.

==Economy==
Moose Jaw is a city of 33,000 at the intersection of the Trans Canada Highway and Highway 2. A Snowbird aerobatic jet and Mac the Moose are large roadside attractions on the No. 1 highway at the tourist info center. Moose Jaw Trolley Company (1912) offers trolley tours of Moose Jaw. Temple Garden&#x27;s Mineral Spa, Tunnels of Moose Jaw, and History of Transportation Western Development Museum. are major sites of interest. The juncture of Moose Jaw and Thunder Creek produced the best source of water for steam engines, and Moose Jaw became the CPR divisional point. Large-capacity concrete grain terminals are replacing the smaller grain elevators that were numerous along the highway, sentinels of most communities along the route. Improved harvest, transport and road construction technology have made the large inland terminals more economically viable. The rural governing body around Moose Jaw is Moose Jaw No. 161, which serves 1,228 residents (2006 census) and includes the Moose Jaw Canadian Forces Base. Meat-processing plants, salt, potash, urea fertilizer, anhydrous ammonia and ethanol producers abound in this area with easy transport access to the Trans–Canada Highway.

In 1917, a group of local residents banded together to purchase enough automobile parts to build 25 cars. These were to be manufactured under the name Moose Jaw Standard. Each group member received a car, but no further buyers were found, and production did not continue.

==Arts and culture==
=== Visual Arts ===
The Moose Jaw Art Guild is a community arts association of local artists dedicated to exhibiting, educating and fostering appreciation for visual arts.

===Film===
The city was profiled in &quot;Moose Jaw: There&#x27;s a Future in Our Past&quot;, a 1992 documentary essay film by former city resident Rick Hancox. 

===Museums===
Moose Jaw is home to one of four Saskatchewan Western Development Museums. The Moose Jaw WDM museum specializes in the history of transportation and has a Snowbirds gallery.

The Sukanen Ship Pioneer Village and Museum is south of Moose Jaw on Sk Hwy 2. The car club at Moose Jaw agreed to the restoration of Tom Sukanen&#x27;s ship at their museum site. Sukanen was a Finnish homesteader who settled near Birsay and hoped to travel home again on a ship he assembled near the South Saskatchewan River. The Sukanen Ship Pioneer Village and Museum features a typical village replete with pioneer artifacts and tractors, cars and trucks restored by the Moose Jaw car club, and is run by volunteers.

The Moose Jaw Museum &amp; Art Gallery is located in Crescent Park at the centre of the downtown area, in the same facility as the Moose Jaw Public Library. The art gallery hosts community exhibits, travelling exhibits, and rotating exhibits from the gallery&#x27;s permanent collection. The museum also has a heritage gallery, which curates and hosts exhibits on local history, including an upcoming &quot;Pandemic Time Capsule&quot; exhibit scheduled for Spring 2021. The Museum &amp; Art Gallery also hosts classes and events.

=== 2SLGBTQ culture ===
In 1978, Anita Bryant visited Moose Jaw as part of the anti-gay Save Our Children campaign. In response, approximately 85 members of the gay and lesbian community marched down Main St. to Crescent Park, where an estimated 150 people gathered to speak out against Bryant.

In 2008, the Gay and Lesbian Association of Moose Jaw (GLAMj) requested and was granted the first official proclamation of Pride Week in Moose Jaw and raised the Rainbow Flag over Moose Jaw&#x27;s City Hall for the first time. The city&#x27;s first pride parade since 1978 was held in 2015, and similar parades have been held annually in late May or early June, usually from Main Street to Crescent Park.

Moose Jaw Pride is an LGBT community organization incorporated as a non-profit in 2014. Moose Jaw Pride was a founding member of the Saskatchewan Pride Network, started in 2016, which serves to connect and support 2SLGBTQ people in small communities across Saskatchewan, many of which do not have an established local pride organization.

Since 2019, Moose Jaw Pride has been working with local partners to promote Moose Jaw as a safe and attractive tourism destination for 2SLGBTQ people. 2SLGBTQ tourist attractions include a rainbow-coloured bench on Main Street, in front of the Rainbow Retro Thrift Shop, and a mural on the back of the Rainbow Retro building that depicts events and symbols from local 2SLGBTQ history, including representations of the Anita Bryant march, the Indigenous two-spirit presence in Saskatchewan, the potluck and coffee social events that were central to 2SLGBTQ community development, and several landmark pride flag raisings.

==Attractions==
Tourist attractions include the Tunnels of Moose Jaw, The Moose Jaw Trolley, the Temple Gardens Mineral Spa Resort, The Western Development Museum, Casino Moose Jaw, Moose Jaw Museum and Art Gallery, Yvette Moore Art Gallery, the Murals of Moose Jaw, and the historic downtown. Every July, the four-day Saskatchewan Festival of Words showcases top Canadian writers from a wide variety of genres. The free three-day Sidewalk Days Festival draws tens of thousands to Main Street the weekend after Canada Day. The Snowbirds flight demonstration team is based at CFB Moose Jaw, south of Moose Jaw in Bushell Park, where the now defunct airshow was performed every summer. It will be brought back in 2019.

Moose Jaw has many parks. Crescent Park is located in downtown. It features a creek, picnic tables, a library, an art museum, a playground, an outdoor swimming pool, water park, a tennis court, lawn bowling field and an amphitheatre. Casino Moose Jaw and Temple Gardens Mineral Spa are across Fairford St. E. and 1st Ave. NE. from Crescent Park. &quot;Wakamow Valley&quot; follows the Moose Jaw River and features both natural and maintained areas. There are many trails throughout the park for hiking and cycling, including picnic tables, barbecues, and four playgrounds. There is also an RV park, Lorne Calvert Campground, formerly known as River Park Campground, which was founded in 1927 and is the longest-running campground in North America. Canoe and kayak rentals are available across the road from the campground. The Moose Jaw Canoe and Kayak Club has been around since the late &#x27;90s and is inside the campground.

Old Wives Lake, a saline lake is 30 km southwest of the city on Highway 363. Buffalo Pound Lake a eutrophic prairie lake is 28 km north on Highway 2. Buffalo Pound Provincial Park is on the south shore and can be accessed by Highway 202 and Highway 301.

=== Tunnels of Moose Jaw ===

The tunnels present two tour attractions: &quot;Passage to Fortune&quot; and &quot;The Chicago Connection&quot;. While &quot;Passage to Fortune&quot; is construed by many visitors to be historically accurate, there is no evidence to suggest that Chinese Canadians lived in the tunnels of the tours outside of minimal anecdotal testimonies. Historically accurate information such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, Chinese Head Tax and the case of Quong Wing v R which occurred at the site of 1 Main street across the location of the tunnels are mentioned throughout the tour. However, &quot;Passage to Fortune&quot; also circulates misinformation about Chinese Canadians in Moose Jaw. Moose Jaw Tour attendees are called &quot;Coolies&quot; at an early stage of the tour. Tour attendees are then guided through the tunnels from the position of Chinese workers indentured to the fictional laundry owner Mr. Burrows who were forced to live underground. In actuality, early Chinese Canadians were often proprietors of their own laundries, a labour-intensive industry many found themselves in due to prejudice barring them from entering other industries. In 1890, the first Chinese business opened in Moose Jaw, was a Chinese laundry. in 1908, nine laundries can be found in the City directory, with eight businesses notably Chinese-run.

The tunnels became a hub of renewed activity in the 1920s for rum-running during Prohibition in the United States. They were reported to have warehoused illegal alcohol that was shipped to the U.S. via the Soo Line Railroad. The tunnels were also used for gambling and prostitution, all without interference from the corrupt police. There has long been anecdotal evidence that American mobster Al Capone visited Moose Jaw or had interests in the bootlegging operations. No written or photographic proof exists of Capone&#x27;s presence, but several firsthand accounts from Moose Javians who claim to have met him have been documented. Capone&#x27;s grandniece also confirmed he had been in Moose Jaw before his 1931 conviction for tax evasion. In the 21st century, the city capitalized on this notoriety to restore the tunnel network into the Tunnels of Moose Jaw, a tourist attraction that opened in June 2000. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, however, states that there is no &quot;evidence that he ever set foot on Canadian soil.&quot;

== Sports and recreation ==
As in most Canadian cities, hockey has played a large part in Moose Jaw&#x27;s sporting culture. Baseball has also been essential to Moose Jaw since its early days; the city won the territorial championship in 1895. Most recently, the 2004 Junior All-Star team (age 13/14) won the Canadian Championship and became the first team from Saskatchewan to win a game at the Little League World Series.

Notable Moose Jaw teams include:
* Moose Jaw Warriors, Western Hockey League team

==Education==

&quot;École Ducharme&quot; offers preschool to grade 12 and is Moose Jaw&#x27;s only Francophone school. 
&quot;École fransaskoise de Moose Jaw&quot; offers French Immersion from preschool to grade 9.

Moose Jaw is also home to a campus of Saskatchewan Polytechnic.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Health care ===
Moose Jaw Union Hospital, part of the Five Hills Health Region, was the primary health care provider for the city since 1948, but closed in 2015 and was replaced by Dr. F.H. Wigmore Regional Hospital in the city&#x27;s northeast end. The new location was partly picked for its proximity to the Trans-Canada Highway. The Wigmore Hospital uses LEAN methodology to save time and money in healthcare.

=== Security ===
The Moose Jaw Fire Department (est. 1906) is a 57-member fire and rescue service that provides fire suppression to the city and CFB Moose Jaw. It has two stations, North Hill Fire Station (Headquarters) and South Hill Fire Station. It is also contracted out to CFB Moose Jaw to provide structural fire suppression services.

Ambulatory (EMS) services are provided by Five Hills Health Region, which operates an EMS station in Moose Jaw; non-emergency services are provided by St. John Ambulance.

The Moose Jaw Police Service, with 54 sworn members, provides policing for the city and holds both municipal and provincial jurisdiction in partnership with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

=== Transportation ===
Moose Jaw Transit provides local bus service to urban areas of the city. This small system operates four routes from a downtown hub on weekdays between 7:15am and 6:15pm. 

The bus fleet was replaced in 2008 by new low-floor accessible vehicles under the federal government&#x27;s one-time public transit capital funding program.

Moose Jaw Municipal Airport is east-northeast of Moose Jaw.
CFB Moose Jaw&#x27;s airfield is also used by civilian aircraft, with civilian operations at the base referring to the facility as Moose Jaw/Air Vice Marshal C.M. McEwen Airport.

Moose Jaw has four photo radar cameras, including two which operate on the TransCanada Highway passing through the city.
