<text>Graph drawing is an area of mathematics and computer science combining methods from geometric graph theory and information visualization to derive two-dimensional depictions of graphs arising from applications such as social network analysis, cartography, linguistics, and bioinformatics.

A drawing of a graph or network diagram is a pictorial representation of the vertices and edges of a graph. This drawing should not be confused with the graph itself: very different layouts can correspond to the same graph. In the abstract, all that matters is which pairs of vertices are connected by edges. In the concrete, however, the arrangement of these vertices and edges within a drawing affects its understandability, usability, fabrication cost, and aesthetics. The problem gets worse if the graph changes over time by adding and deleting edges (dynamic graph drawing) and the goal is to preserve the user&#x27;s mental map.

==Graphical conventions==

Graphs are frequently drawn as node–link diagrams in which the vertices are represented as disks, boxes, or textual labels and the edges are represented as line segments, polylines, or curves in the Euclidean plane. Node–link diagrams can be traced back to the 14th-16th century works of Pseudo-Lull which were published under the name of Ramon Llull, a 13th century polymath. Pseudo-Lull drew diagrams of this type for complete graphs in order to analyze all pairwise combinations among sets of metaphysical concepts.

In the case of directed graphs, arrowheads form a commonly used graphical convention to show their orientation; however, user studies have shown that other conventions such as tapering provide this information more effectively. Upward planar drawing uses the convention that every edge is oriented from a lower vertex to a higher vertex, making arrowheads unnecessary.

Alternative conventions to node–link diagrams include adjacency representations such as circle packings, in which vertices are represented by disjoint regions in the plane and edges are represented by adjacencies between regions; intersection representations in which vertices are represented by non-disjoint geometric objects and edges are represented by their intersections; visibility representations in which vertices are represented by regions in the plane and edges are represented by regions that have an unobstructed line of sight to each other; confluent drawings, in which edges are represented as smooth curves within mathematical train tracks; fabrics, in which nodes are represented as horizontal lines and edges as vertical lines; and visualizations of the adjacency matrix of the graph.

==Quality measures==
Many different quality measures have been defined for graph drawings, in an attempt to find objective means of evaluating their aesthetics and usability. In addition to guiding the choice between different layout methods for the same graph, some layout methods attempt to directly optimize these measures.

*The crossing number of a drawing is the number of pairs of edges that cross each other. If the graph is planar, then it is often convenient to draw it without any edge intersections; that is, in this case, a graph drawing represents a graph embedding. However, nonplanar graphs frequently arise in applications, so graph drawing algorithms must generally allow for edge crossings.
*The area of a drawing is the size of its smallest bounding box, relative to the closest distance between any two vertices. Drawings with smaller area are generally preferable to those with larger area, because they allow the features of the drawing to be shown at greater size and therefore more legibly. The aspect ratio of the bounding box may also be important.
*Symmetry display is the problem of finding symmetry groups within a given graph, and finding a drawing that displays as much of the symmetry as possible. Some layout methods automatically lead to symmetric drawings; alternatively, some drawing methods start by finding symmetries in the input graph and using them to construct a drawing.
*It is important that edges have shapes that are as simple as possible, to make it easier for the eye to follow them. In polyline drawings, the complexity of an edge may be measured by its number of bends, and many methods aim to provide drawings with few total bends or few bends per edge. Similarly for spline curves the complexity of an edge may be measured by the number of control points on the edge.
*Several commonly used quality measures concern lengths of edges: it is generally desirable to minimize the total length of the edges as well as the maximum length of any edge. Additionally, it may be preferable for the lengths of edges to be uniform rather than highly varied.
*Angular resolution is a measure of the sharpest angles in a graph drawing. If a graph has vertices with high degree then it necessarily will have small angular resolution, but the angular resolution can be bounded below by a function of the degree.
*The slope number of a graph is the minimum number of distinct edge slopes needed in a drawing with straight line segment edges (allowing crossings). Cubic graphs have slope number at most four, but graphs of degree five may have unbounded slope number; it remains open whether the slope number of degree-4 graphs is bounded.

==Layout methods==
There are many different graph layout strategies:
*In force-based layout systems, the graph drawing software modifies an initial vertex placement by continuously moving the vertices according to a system of forces based on physical metaphors related to systems of springs or molecular mechanics. Typically, these systems combine attractive forces between adjacent vertices with repulsive forces between all pairs of vertices, in order to seek a layout in which edge lengths are small while vertices are well-separated. These systems may perform gradient descent based minimization of an energy function, or they may translate the forces directly into velocities or accelerations for the moving vertices.
*Spectral layout methods use as coordinates the eigenvectors of a matrix such as the Laplacian derived from the adjacency matrix of the graph.
*Orthogonal layout methods, which allow the edges of the graph to run horizontally or vertically, parallel to the coordinate axes of the layout. These methods were originally designed for VLSI and PCB layout problems but they have also been adapted for graph drawing. They typically involve a multiphase approach in which an input graph is planarized by replacing crossing points by vertices, a topological embedding of the planarized graph is found, edge orientations are chosen to minimize bends, vertices are placed consistently with these orientations, and finally a layout compaction stage reduces the area of the drawing.
*Tree layout algorithms these show a rooted tree-like formation, suitable for trees. Often, in a technique called &quot;balloon layout&quot;, the children of each node in the tree are drawn on a circle surrounding the node, with the radii of these circles diminishing at lower levels in the tree so that these circles do not overlap.
*Layered graph drawing methods (often called Sugiyama-style drawing) are best suited for directed acyclic graphs or graphs that are nearly acyclic, such as the graphs of dependencies between modules or functions in a software system. In these methods, the nodes of the graph are arranged into horizontal layers using methods such as the Coffman–Graham algorithm, in such a way that most edges go downwards from one layer to the next; after this step, the nodes within each layer are arranged in order to minimize crossings.

*Arc diagrams, a layout style dating back to the 1960s, place vertices on a line; edges may be drawn as semicircles above or below the line, or as smooth curves linked together from multiple semicircles.
*Circular layout methods place the vertices of the graph on a circle, choosing carefully the ordering of the vertices around the circle to reduce crossings and place adjacent vertices close to each other. Edges may be drawn either as chords of the circle or as arcs inside or outside of the circle. In some cases, multiple circles may be used.
*Dominance drawing places vertices in such a way that one vertex is upwards, rightwards, or both of another if and only if it is reachable from the other vertex. In this way, the layout style makes the reachability relation of the graph visually apparent.

==Application-specific graph drawings==
Graphs and graph drawings arising in other areas of application include
* Sociograms, drawings of a social network, as often offered by social network analysis software
* Hasse diagrams, a type of graph drawing specialized to partial orders
* Dessin d&#x27;enfants, a type of graph drawing used in algebraic geometry
* State diagrams, graphical representations of finite-state machines
* Computer network diagrams, depictions of the nodes and connections in a computer network
* Flowcharts and drakon-charts, drawings in which the nodes represent the steps of an algorithm and the edges represent control flow between steps.
* Project network, graphical depiction of the chronological order in which activities of a project are to be completed.
* Data-flow diagrams, drawings in which the nodes represent the components of an information system and the edges represent the movement of information from one component to another.
* Bioinformatics including phylogenetic trees, protein–protein interaction networks, and metabolic pathways.

In addition, the placement and routing steps of electronic design automation (EDA) are similar in many ways to graph drawing, as is the problem of greedy embedding in distributed computing, and the graph drawing literature includes several results borrowed from the EDA literature. However, these problems also differ in several important ways: for instance, in EDA, area minimization and signal length are more important than aesthetics, and the routing problem in EDA may have more than two terminals per net while the analogous problem in graph drawing generally only involves pairs of vertices for each edge.

<doc id="325814" wikidata="Q94443" url="?curid=325814" title="Ozark–St. Francis National Forest">
<text>The Ozark – St. Francis National Forest is a United States National Forest that is located in the state of Arkansas. It is composed of two separate forests, Ozark National Forest in the Ozark Mountains; and St. Francis National Forest on Crowley&#x27;s Ridge. Each forest has distinct biological, topographical, and geological differences.

==Description==
Together, the two forests are home to 23 developed campgrounds, and include nine swimming areas, of hiking trails, and of streams for fishing. The majority of the trails in what are now the Ozark National Forest and St. Francis National Forest were constructed under the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC).

The Forest contains of old-growth forests. The old-growth forests typically occur in the southern portion of the Forest on ridges and steep south-facing slopes and are dominated by Shortleaf Pine and various oaks, including Post Oak, Blackjack Oak, Eastern Black Oak, White Oak, and Northern Red Oak. The Forest is also home to six different endangered species.

Several National Scenic Byways cross the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest, including the Scenic 7 Byway which runs from Missouri to Louisiana, of which are within the Ozark National Forest. Scenic 7 Byway offers the greatest variety of Ozark topography and scenic vistas. The Ozark Highlands Byway provides access to the Mulberry River, Big Piney Creek, and Buffalo National River for fishermen and canoeists. The Mount Magazine Byway offers scenic overlooks of the Arkansas River Valley, and the Sylamore Scenic Byway offers a scenic drive to the Blanchard Springs Caverns. Forest headquarters are located in Russellville, Arkansas.

===Ozark National Forest===
The Ozark National Forest encompasses primarily in the scenic Ozark Mountains in northern Arkansas. The forest includes the highest point in Arkansas, Mount Magazine, and Blanchard Springs Caverns. The southern section of the forest lies along the Arkansas River Valley south to the Ouachita Mountains.

The forest was created in 1908 by proclamation of President Theodore Roosevelt. The forest is home to over 500 species of trees and woody plants. Hardwoods, predominantly oak and hickory, comprise the majority of the forest. The forest contains five designated wilderness areas and several Wildlife Management Areas.

The Ozark Highlands Trail, built and maintained by over 3,000 volunteers, is the longest hiking trail in the forest and extends for from the Buffalo National River to Lake Fort Smith State Park in the far western portion of the state. The forest also contains several multi-use trails including the Pedestal Rock Trail and the Alum Cove Natural Bridge Trail and a few wheelchair-accessible trails.

In addition to the hiking trails, the forest provides trails designated for horseback riding, canoeing, mountain biking, and all-terrain vehicles. The longest horse trail is the Sylamore Trail with a length of . This trail passes over rocky bluffs, into deep hollows, and across mountain streams. The Huckleberry Mountain Horse Trail has a stop at the Sorghum Hollow Horse Camp which was built and maintained by local horsemen.

Ozark National Forest is located in parts of 16 counties. In descending order of forestland they are Newton, Pope, Johnson, Franklin, Crawford, Logan, Baxter, Stone, Madison, Yell, Van Buren, Searcy, Washington, Benton, Conway, and Marion counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Clarksville, Hector, Jasper, Mountain View, Ozark, and Paris.

====Wilderness areas====
There are five officially designated wilderness areas lying within Ozark National Forest that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System.
* East Fork Wilderness
* Hurricane Creek Wilderness
* Leatherwood Wilderness
* Richland Creek Wilderness
* Upper Buffalo Wilderness

===St. Francis National Forest===
The St. Francis National Forest was established on November 8, 1960 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It covers in eastern Arkansas along the Mississippi River, in Lee and Phillips counties, and is one of the smallest national forests in the United States. There are local ranger district offices located in Marianna. The majority of the Forest is situated on Crowley&#x27;s Ridge, but it extends into the low, flat lands along the Mississippi and St. Francis Rivers. St. Francis National Forest is the only place in the National Forest System where the public can enjoy the Mississippi River from the shoreline.

While lacking the broad range of recreational activity available in other national forests, St. Francis National Forest is known for its fishing. The two largest lakes, Bear Creek Reservoir and Storm Creek Lake, enjoy large populations of Largemouth bass, Crappie, Warmouth, and Channel catfish.

<text>The Cuban solenodon or almiquí (&quot;Atopogale cubana&quot;) is a small, furry, shrew-like mammal endemic to mountainous forests on Cuba. It is the only species in the genus Atopogale. An elusive animal, it lives in burrows and is only active at night when it uses its unusual toxic saliva to feed on insects. The solenodons (family Solenodontidae), native to the Caribbean, are one of only a few mammals that are venomous. 

The Cuban solenodon is endangered and was once considered extinct due to its rarity. It and the Hispaniolan solenodon (&quot;Solenodon paradoxus&quot;) are the only surviving solenodon species; the others are extinct.

== Taxonomy ==
Although formerly classified in the genus &quot;Solenodon&quot;, phylogenetic evidence supports it being in its own genus, &quot;Atopogale&quot;.

==Rediscovery==
Since its discovery in 1861 by the German naturalist Wilhelm Peters, only 36 had ever been caught. By 1970, some thought the Cuban solenodon had become extinct, since no specimens had been found since 1890. Three were captured in 1974 and 1975, and subsequent surveys showed it still occurred in many places in central and western Oriente Province, at the eastern end of Cuba; however, it is rare everywhere. Prior to 2003, the most recent sighting was in 1999, mainly because it is a nocturnal burrower, living underground, and thus is very rarely seen. The Cuban solenodon found in 2003 was named Alejandrito. It had a mass of and was healthy. It was released back into the wild after two days of scientific study were completed.

==Appearance==
With small eyes, and dark brown to black hair, the Cuban solenodon is sometimes compared to a shrew, although it most closely resembles members of the family Tenrecidae of Madagascar. It is long from nose to tail-tip and resembles a large brown rat with an extremely elongated snout and a long, naked, scaly tail.

==Status==
Willy Ley wrote in 1964 that the Cuban solenodon was, if not extinct, among &quot;the rarest animals on earth&quot;. It was declared extinct in 1970, but was rediscovered in 1974. Since 1982, it has been listed as an endangered species, in part because it only breeds a single litter of one to three in a year (leading to a long population recovery time), and because of predation by invasive species, such as small Indian mongooses, black rats, feral cats, and feral dogs. The species is also thought to be threatened by deforestation as well as habitat degradation due to logging and mining. However, there is very little conservation attention given to the species.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is endemic to mountainous forests in the Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa mountain range of eastern Cuba, in the provinces of Holguín, Guantánamo, and Santiago de Cuba, though subfossil evidence showed it once inhabited throughout the island. It is nocturnal and travels at night along the forest floor, looking for insects and small animals on which to feed.

==Behavior==
This species has a varied diet. At night, they search the forest floor litter for insects and other invertebrates, fungi, and roots. They climb well and feed on fruits, berries, and buds, but have more predatory habits, too. With venom from modified salivary glands in the lower jaw, they can kill lizards, frogs, small birds, or even rodents. They seem not to be immune to the venom of their own kind, and cage mates have been reported dying after fights.

==Mating==

Cuban solenodons only meet to mate, and the male practices polygeny (i.e. mates with multiple females). The males and females are not found together unless they are mating. The pair will meet up, mate, then separate. The males do not participate in raising any of the young.

<text>The JPMorgan Chase Tower, formerly Texas Commerce Tower, is a , , 75-story skyscraper at 600 Travis Street in Downtown Houston, Texas, United States. It is currently the tallest building in Texas and the South Central region of the United States, the tallest five-sided building in the world, the 29th-tallest building in the United States, and the 107th-tallest building in the world.

== Overview ==
Originally completed in 1981 as &quot;Texas Commerce Tower&quot; and commissioned by Texas Commerce Bancshares, the skyscraper attains a height of 1002 feet with 75 floors. Overlooking United Energy Plaza located on Capitol Avenue and Milam Street, it features the Joan Miro sculpture, &quot;Personage and Birds.&quot; A terrace on the plaza includes a water garden. Khalid bin Mahfouz was a co-developer of the building, part of which occupied the former Uptown Theatre, demolished in 1965.

Upon its completion, the building surpassed Aon Center in Los Angeles to become the tallest building in the United States west of the Mississippi River, a title it held until Los Angeles&#x27;s Library Tower, now known as the U.S. Bank Tower, was built in 1990.

JPMorgan Chase Tower is connected to the Houston Downtown Tunnel System. This system forms a network of subterranean, climate-controlled, pedestrian walkways that link twenty-five full city blocks. The lobby of JPMorgan Chase Tower has been designed to harmonize not only with the height of the structure but also with the portico of Jones Hall, home of the Houston Symphony Orchestra, and which occupies the city block immediately to the west. For that reason, a five-story glass wall supported by a stainless steel space frame spans the entire 85-foot width of the front entrance, making the lobby area light and airy, and opening up the space to the plaza outside.. The Tower also includes of retail space.

While the tower&#x27;s name reflects the bank JPMorgan Chase, the only space designated to Chase was a single branch office on the bottom floor until 2021. The tower is owned by Cerberus Capital Management and Hines Interests.

==Hurricane Ike==
On September 13, 2008, many of the tower&#x27;s windows were blown out as Hurricane Ike struck the city, leaving desks exposed, metal blinds hanging in twisted heaps, and smoky black glass covering the streets below. Police were forced to cordon off the area due to the amount of debris in the streets.

At first, it was speculated that the glass came off the building due to impact from debris or due to high-speed winds in the confined spaces. However, flying glass debris must be entirely governed by drag and lift forces that overcome gravity for a considerable time period. Also, the high-wind-speed-in-confined-spaces theory is not entirely justified since the height of damage seen in the tower exceeded too significantly the height of the Chase Center parking garage next to the tower. This theory was proposed because an increase in wind speed produces a drop in external pressure. This drop in pressure at the side and leeward walls, combined with the normal, higher pressure inside the building would result in a force that could possibly overcome design pressures causing the window to separate. Other theories included those of ABS Consulting Engineers, who suggested that glazing damage may have been produced by &quot;organized&quot; vortices produced by the upwind Calpine Center and steady vortices between the Tower and the Chase Center parking garage.

The NatHaz Modeling Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame is currently conducting an investigation of the flow field around the structure, modeling the tower and the immediate area surrounding it using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Preliminary findings suggest that the localized damage is the result of a confluence of multiple mechanisms arising from the arrangement of nearby buildings, critical flow directionality and the possible entrapment of debris within evolving flow structures.

==Fictional portrayals==

* The building stood in for the headquarters of the fictional &quot;Knox Oil &amp; Gas Company&quot; in the 1983 film &quot;Local Hero&quot;.
* The building stood in as the fictional location of Charles C. Foster&#x27;s law office in the 2009 film &quot;Mao&#x27;s Last Dancer&quot;.

<text>The Green Man, also known as a foliate head, is a motif in architecture and art, of a face made of, or completely surrounded by, foliage, which normally spreads out from the centre of the face. Apart from a purely decorative function, the Green Man is primarily interpreted as a symbol of rebirth, representing the cycle of new growth that occurs every spring. 

The Green Man motif has many variations. Branches or vines may sprout from the mouth, nostrils, or other parts of the face, and these shoots may bear flowers or fruit. Found in many cultures from many ages around the world, the Green Man is often related to natural vegetation deities. Often used as decorative architectural ornaments, where they are a form of mascaron or ornamental head, Green Men are frequently found in architectural sculpture on both secular and ecclesiastical buildings in the Western tradition. In churches in England, the image was used to illustrate a popular sermon describing the mystical origins of the cross of Jesus. 

&quot;Green Man&quot; type foliate heads first appeared in England during the early 12th century deriving from those of France, and were especially popular in the Gothic architecture of the 13th to 15th centuries. The idea that the Green Man motif represents a pagan mythological figure, as proposed by Lady Raglan in 1939, despite its popularity with the lay public, is not supported by evidence.

==Types==
Usually referred to in art history as foliate heads or foliate masks, representations of the Green Man take many forms, but most just show a &quot;mask&quot; or frontal depiction of a face, which in architecture is usually in relief. The simplest depict a man&#x27;s face peering out of dense foliage. Some may have leaves for hair, perhaps with a leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare. Lady Raglan coined the term &quot;Green Man&quot; for this type of architectural feature in her 1939 article &quot;The Green Man in Church Architecture&quot; in &quot;The Folklore Journal&quot;. It is thought that her interest stemmed from carvings at St. Jerome&#x27;s Church in Llangwm, Monmouthshire.

The Green Man appears in many forms, with the three most common types categorized as:

*the Foliate Head: completely covered in green leaves
*the Disgorging Head: spews vegetation from its mouth
*the Bloodsucker Head: sprouts vegetation from all facial orifices (e.g. tear ducts, nostrils, mouth, and ears)

==History==

In terms of formalism, art historians see a connection with the masks in Iron Age Celtic art, where faces emerge from stylized vegetal ornament in the &quot;Plastic style&quot; metalwork of La Tène art. Since there are so few survivals, and almost none in wood, the lack of a continuous series of examples is not a fatal objection to such a continuity. 

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English Folklore&quot; suggests that they ultimately have their origins in late Roman art from leaf masks used to represent gods and mythological figures. A character superficially similar to the Green Man, in the form of a partly foliate mask surrounded by Bacchic figures, appears at the centre of the 4th-century silver salver in the Mildenhall Treasure, found at a Roman villa site in Suffolk, England; the mask is generally agreed to represent Neptune or Oceanus and the foliation is of seaweed.

In his lectures at Gresham College, historian and professor Ronald Hutton traces the green man to India, stating &quot;the component parts of Lady Raglan&#x27;s construct of the Green Man were dismantled. The medieval foliate heads were studied by Kathleen Basford in 1978 and Mercia MacDermott in 2003. They were revealed to have been a motif originally developed in India, which travelled through the medieval Arab empire to Christian Europe. There it became a decoration for monks’ manuscripts, from which it spread to churches.&quot; 

A late 4th-century example of a green man disgorging vegetation from his mouth is at St. Abre, in St. Hilaire-le-grand, France. 11th century Romanesque Templar churches in Jerusalem have Romanesque foliate heads. Harding tentatively suggested that the symbol may have originated in Asia Minor and been brought to Europe by travelling stone carvers. The tradition of the Green Man carved into Christian churches is found across Europe, including examples such as the Seven Green Men of Nicosia carved into the facade of the thirteenth century St Nicholas Church in Cyprus. The motif fitted very easily into the developing use of vegetal architectural sculpture in Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Europe. Later foliate heads in churches may have reflected the legends around Seth, the son of Adam, according to which he plants seeds in his dead father&#x27;s mouth as he lies in his grave. The tree that grew from them became the tree of the true cross of the crucifixion. This tale was in &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine, a very popular thirteenth century compilation of Christian religious stories, from which the subjects of church sermons were often taken, especially after 1483, when William Caxton printed an English translation of the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;.

According to the Christian author Stephen Miller, author of &quot;The Green Man in Medieval England: Christian Shoots from Pagan Roots&quot; (2022), &quot;It is a Christian/Judaic-derived motif relating to the legends and medieval hagiographies of the Quest of Seth – the three twigs/seeds/kernels planted below the tongue of post-fall Adam by his son Seth (provided by the angel of mercy responsible for guarding Eden) shoot forth, bringing new life to humankind&quot;. This notion was first proposed by James Coulter (2006).

From the Renaissance onward, elaborate variations on the Green Man theme, often with animal heads rather than human faces, appear in many media other than carvings (including manuscripts, metalwork, bookplates, and stained glass). They seem to have been used for purely decorative effect rather than reflecting any deeply held belief. 

===Modern history===
In Britain, the image of the Green Man enjoyed a revival in the 19th century, becoming popular with architects during the Gothic revival and the Arts and Crafts era, when it appeared as a decorative motif in and on many buildings, both religious and secular. American architects took up the motif around the same time. Many variations can be found in Neo-gothic Victorian architecture. He was popular amongst Australian stonemasons and can be found on many secular and sacred buildings, including an example on Broadway, Sydney. In 1887 a Swiss engraver, Numa Guyot, created a bookplate depicting a Green Man in exquisite detail. 

In April 2023, a Green Man&#x27;s head was depicted on the invitation for the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla, designed by heraldic artist and manuscript illuminator Andrew Jamieson. According to the official royal website: &quot;Central to the design is the motif of the Green Man, an ancient figure from British folklore, symbolic of spring and rebirth, to celebrate the new reign. The shape of the Green Man, crowned in natural foliage, is formed of leaves of oak, ivy, and hawthorn, and the emblematic flowers of the United Kingdom.&quot; which alluded to &quot;the nature worshipper in King Charles&quot; but polarized the public. Indeed, as the medieval art historian Cassandra Harrington pointed out, although vegetal figures were abundant throughout the medieval and early modern period, the foliate head motif is not ‘an ancient figure from British folklore’, as the Royal Household has proclaimed, but a European import.&#x27;

<doc id="325831" wikidata="Q260606" url="?curid=325831" title="Injection moulding">
<text>Injection moulding (U.S. spelling: injection molding) is a manufacturing process for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mould, or mold. Injection moulding can be performed with a host of materials mainly including metals (for which the process is called die-casting), glasses, elastomers, confections, and most commonly thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Material for the part is fed into a heated barrel, mixed (using a helical screw), and injected into a mould cavity, where it cools and hardens to the configuration of the cavity. After a product is designed, usually by an industrial designer or an engineer, moulds are made by a mould-maker (or toolmaker) from metal, usually either steel or aluminium, and precision-machined to form the features of the desired part. Injection moulding is widely used for manufacturing a variety of parts, from the smallest components to entire body panels of cars. Advances in 3D printing technology, using photopolymers that do not melt during the injection moulding of some lower-temperature thermoplastics, can be used for some simple injection moulds.
Injection moulding uses a special-purpose machine that has three parts: the injection unit, the mould and the clamp. Parts to be injection-moulded must be very carefully designed to facilitate the moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and the properties of the moulding machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of injection moulding is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities.

==Applications==

Injection moulding is used to create many things such as wire spools, packaging, bottle caps, automotive parts and components, toys, pocket combs, some musical instruments (and parts of them), one-piece chairs and small tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including gears), and most other plastic products available today. Injection moulding is the most common modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object.

==Process characteristics==

Injection moulding uses a ram or screw-type plunger to force molten plastic or rubber material into a mould cavity; this solidifies into a shape that has conformed to the contour of the mould. It is most commonly used to process both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, with the volume used of the former being considerably higher. Thermoplastics are prevalent due to characteristics that make them highly suitable for injection moulding, such as ease of recycling, versatility for a wide variety of applications, and ability to soften and flow on heating. Thermoplastics also have an element of safety over thermosets; if a thermosetting polymer is not ejected from the injection barrel in a timely manner, chemical crosslinking may occur causing the screw and check valves to seize and potentially damaging the injection moulding machine.

Injection moulding consists of the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould, which shapes the polymer into the desired form. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and are more prone to wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fabricate.

When thermoplastics are moulded, typically pelletised raw material is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon entrance to the barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened as a result of increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects at the front of the screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. The exact amount of shrinkage is a function of the resin being used, and can be relatively predictable. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.

For a two-shot mould, two separate materials are incorporated into one part. This type of injection moulding is used to add a soft touch to knobs, to give a product multiple colours, or to produce a part with multiple performance characteristics.

For thermosets, typically two different chemical components are injected into the barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions that eventually crosslinks the material into a single connected network of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid. Solidification in the injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions; therefore, minimising the thermoset curing within the barrel is vital. This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel&#x27;s volume capacity and by maximising the cycle times. These factors have led to the use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts. Then, the mould closes and the process repeats.

Pre-moulded or machined components can be inserted into the cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process is often used to create plastic parts with protruding metal screws so they can be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.

A parting line, sprue, gate marks, and ejector pin marks are usually present on the final part. None of these features are typically desired, but are unavoidable due to the nature of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate that joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and ejector pin marks result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the melting surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer positions these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.

==History==
In 1834 a British patent for the injection moulding of candles was filed by a pewterer called Joseph Morgan.

In 1846 the British inventor Charles Hancock, a relative of Thomas Hancock, patented an injection moulding machine.

American inventor John Wesley Hyatt, together with his brother Isaiah, patented one of the first injection moulding machines in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs (generally though, plastics, in its modern definition, are a more recent development ).

The German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker invented the first soluble forms of cellulose acetate in 1903, which was much less flammable than cellulose nitrate. It was eventually made available in a powder form from which it was readily injection moulded. Arthur Eichengrün developed the first injection moulding press in 1919. In 1939, Arthur Eichengrün patented the injection moulding of plasticised cellulose acetate.

The industry expanded rapidly in the 1940s because World War II created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection and the quality of articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted injection moulding process, which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste. By 1979, plastic production overtook steel production, and by 1990, aluminium moulds were widely used in injection moulding. Today, screw injection machines account for the vast majority of all injection machines.

The plastic injection moulding industry has evolved over the years from producing combs and buttons to producing a vast array of products for many industries including automotive, medical, aerospace, consumer products, toys, plumbing, packaging, and construction.

==Examples of polymers best suited for the process==
Most polymers, sometimes referred to as resins, may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. Since 1995, the total number of available materials for injection moulding has increased at a rate of 750 per year; there were approximately 18,000 materials available when that trend began. Available materials include alloys or blends of previously developed materials, so product designers can choose the material with the best set of properties from a vast selection. Major criteria for selection of a material are the strength and function required for the final part, as well as the cost, but also each material has different parameters for moulding that must be taken into account. Other considerations when choosing an injection moulding material include flexural modulus of elasticity, or the degree to which a material can be bent without damage, as well as heat deflection and water absorption. Common polymers like epoxy and phenolic are examples of thermosetting plastics while nylon, polyethylene, and polystyrene are thermoplastic. Until comparatively recently, plastic springs were not possible, but advances in polymer properties make them now quite practical. Applications include buckles for anchoring and disconnecting outdoor-equipment webbing.

==Equipment==
Injection moulding machines consist of a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed is determined by the projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it requires more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used and the size of the part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.

===Mould===
Mould or die are the common terms used to describe the tool used to produce plastic parts in moulding.

Since moulds have been expensive to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production where thousands of parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material for the mold is not only based on cost considerations, but also has a lot to do with the product life cycle. In general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan offsets the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even hundreds of thousands of parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.

====Mould design====
The mould consists of two primary components, the injection mould (A plate) and the ejector mould (B plate). These components are also referred to as &quot;moulder&quot; and &quot;mouldmaker&quot;. Plastic resin enters the mould through a &quot;sprue&quot; or &quot;gate&quot; in the injection mould; the sprue bushing is to seal tightly against the nozzle of the injection barrel of the moulding machine and to allow molten plastic to flow from the barrel into the mould, also known as the cavity. The sprue bushing directs the molten plastic to the cavity images through channels that are machined into the faces of the A and B plates. These channels allow plastic to run along them, so they are referred to as runners. The molten plastic flows through the runner and enters one or more specialised gates and into the cavity geometry to form the desired part.
The amount of resin required to fill the sprue, runner and cavities of a mould comprises a &quot;shot&quot;. Trapped air in the mould can escape through air vents that are ground into the parting line of the mould, or around ejector pins and slides that are slightly smaller than the holes retaining them. If the trapped air is not allowed to escape, it is compressed by the pressure of the incoming material and squeezed into the corners of the cavity, where it prevents filling and can also cause other defects. The air can even become so compressed that it ignites and burns the surrounding plastic material.

To allow for removal of the moulded part from the mould, the mould features must not overhang one another in the direction that the mould opens, unless parts of the mould are designed to move from between such overhangs when the mould opens using components called Lifters.

Sides of the part that appear parallel with the direction of draw (the axis of the cored position (hole) or insert is parallel to the up and down movement of the mould as it opens and closes) are typically angled slightly, called draft, to ease release of the part from the mould. Insufficient draft can cause deformation or damage. The draft required for mould release is primarily dependent on the depth of the cavity; the deeper the cavity, the more draft necessary. Shrinkage must also be taken into account when determining the draft required. If the skin is too thin, then the moulded part tends to shrink onto the cores that form while cooling and cling to those cores, or the part may warp, twist, blister or crack when the cavity is pulled away.

A mould is usually designed so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into the surface of the mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.

The standard method of cooling is passing a coolant (usually water) through a series of holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has absorbed heat from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.

To ease maintenance and venting, cavities and cores are divided into pieces, called &quot;inserts&quot;, and sub-assemblies, also called &quot;inserts&quot;, &quot;blocks&quot;, or &quot;chase blocks&quot;. By substituting interchangeable inserts, one mould may make several variations of the same part.

More complex parts are formed using more complex moulds. These may have sections called slides, that move into a cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are pulled away from the plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes the slides to move forward along the angle pins.

A mould can produce several copies of the same parts in a single &quot;shot&quot;. The number of &quot;impressions&quot; in the mould of that part is often incorrectly referred to as cavitation. A tool with one impression is often called a single &quot;impression&quot; (cavity) mould. A mould with two or more cavities of the same parts is usually called a multiple &quot;impression&quot; (cavity) mould. (Not to be confused with &quot;Multi-&quot;shot&quot; moulding&quot; {which is dealt with in the next section.}) Some extremely high production volume moulds (like those for bottle caps) can have over 128 cavities.

In some cases, multiple cavity tooling moulds a series of different parts in the same tool. Some toolmakers call these moulds family moulds, as all the parts are related—e.g., plastic model kits.

Some moulds allow previously moulded parts to be reinserted to allow a new plastic layer to form around the first part. This is often referred to as overmoulding. This system can allow for production of one-piece tires and wheels.

Moulds for highly precise and extremely small parts from micro injection molding requires extra care in the design stage, as material resins react differently compared to their full-sized counterparts where they must quickly fill these incredibly small spaces, which puts them under intense shear strains.

===== Multi-shot moulding =====
Two-shot, double-shot or multi-shot moulds are designed to &quot;overmould&quot; within a single moulding cycle and must be processed on specialised injection moulding machines with two or more injection units. This process is actually an injection moulding process performed &quot;twice&quot; and therefore can allow only for a much smaller margin of error. In the first step, the base colour material is moulded into a basic shape, which contains spaces for the second shot. Then the second material, a different colour, is injection-moulded into those spaces. Pushbuttons and keys, for instance, made by this process have markings that cannot wear off, and remain legible with heavy use.

====Mould storage====
Manufacturers go to great lengths to protect custom moulds due to their high average costs. The perfect temperature and humidity levels are maintained to ensure the longest possible lifespan for each custom mould. Custom moulds, such as those used for rubber injection moulding, are stored in temperature and humidity controlled environments to prevent warping.

===Tool materials===
Tool steel is often used. Mild steel, aluminium, nickel or epoxy are suitable only for prototype or very short production runs. Modern hard aluminium (7075 and 2024 alloys) with proper mould design, can easily make moulds capable of 100,000 or more part life with proper mould maintenance.
===Machining===
Moulds are built through two main methods: standard machining and EDM. Standard machining, in its conventional form, has historically been the method of building injection moulds. With technological developments, CNC machining became the predominant means of making more complex moulds with more accurate mould details in less time than traditional methods.

The electrical discharge machining (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes that are difficult to machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface over a period of many hours, which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.

===Cost===
The number of cavities incorporated into a mould directly correlate in moulding costs. Fewer cavities require far less tooling work, so limiting the number of cavities lowers initial manufacturing costs to build an injection mould.

As the number of cavities play a vital role in moulding costs, so does the complexity of the part&#x27;s design. Complexity can be incorporated into many factors such as surface finishing, tolerance requirements, internal or external threads, fine detailing or the number of undercuts that may be incorporated.

Further details, such as undercuts, or any feature that needs additional tooling, increases mould cost. Surface finish of the core and cavity of moulds further influences cost.

Rubber injection moulding process produces a high yield of durable products, making it the most efficient and cost-effective method of moulding. Consistent vulcanisation processes involving precise temperature control significantly reduces all waste material.

==Injection process==

Usually, the plastic materials are formed in the shape of pellets or granules and sent from the raw material manufacturers in paper bags. With injection moulding, pre-dried granular plastic is fed by a forced ram from a hopper into a heated barrel. As the granules are slowly moved forward by a screw-type plunger, the plastic is forced into a heated chamber, where it is melted. As the plunger advances, the melted plastic is forced through a nozzle that rests against the mould, allowing it to enter the mould cavity through a gate and runner system. The mould remains cold so the plastic solidifies almost as soon as the mould is filled.
===Injection moulding cycle===
The sequence of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.

===Scientific versus traditional moulding===
Traditionally, the injection portion of the moulding process was done at one constant pressure to fill and pack the cavity. This method, however, allowed for a large variation in dimensions from cycle-to-cycle. More commonly used now is scientific or decoupled moulding, a method pioneered by RJG Inc. In this the injection of the plastic is &quot;decoupled&quot; into stages to allow better control of part dimensions and more cycle-to-cycle (commonly called shot-to-shot in the industry) consistency. First the cavity is filled to approximately 98% full using velocity (speed) control. Although the pressure should be sufficient to allow for the desired speed, pressure limitations during this stage are undesirable. Once the cavity is 98% full, the machine switches from velocity control to pressure control, where the cavity is &quot;packed out&quot; at a constant pressure, where sufficient velocity to reach desired pressures is required. This lets workers control part dimensions to within thousandths of an inch or better.

===Different types of injection moulding processes===
Although most injection moulding processes are covered by the conventional process description above, there are several important moulding variations including, but not limited to:
*Die casting
*Metal injection moulding
*Thin-wall injection moulding
*Injection moulding of liquid silicone rubber
*Reaction injection moulding
*Micro injection moulding
*Gas-assisted injection moulding
*Cube mold technology
*Multi-material injection molding

==Process troubleshooting==
Like all industrial processes, injection molding can produce flawed parts, even in toys. In the field of injection moulding, troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with the design of the mould or the characteristics of the process itself. Trials are often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in the injection process.

When filling a new or unfamiliar mould for the first time, where shot size for that mould is unknown, a technician/tool setter may perform a trial run before a full production run. They start with a small shot weight and fills gradually until the mould is 95 to 99% full. Once they achieve this, they apply a small amount of holding pressure and increase holding time until gate freeze off (solidification time) has occurred. Gate freeze off time can be determined by increasing the hold time, and then weighing the part. When the weight of the part does not change, the gate has frozen and no more material is injected into the part. Gate solidification time is important, as this determines cycle time and the quality and consistency of the product, which itself is an important issue in the economics of the production process. Holding pressure is increased until the parts are free of sinks and part weight has been achieved.

===Moulding defects===
Injection moulding is a complex technology with possible production problems. They can be caused either by defects in the moulds, or more often by the moulding process itself.

Methods such as industrial CT scanning can help with finding these defects externally as well as internally.

===Tolerances===
Tolerance depends on the dimensions of the part. An example of a standard tolerance for a 1-inch dimension of an LDPE part with 0.125 inch wall thickness is +/- 0.008 inch (0.2 mm).

==Power requirements==
The power required for this process of injection moulding depends on many things and varies between materials used. &quot;Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide&quot; states that the power requirements depend on &quot;a material&#x27;s specific gravity, melting point, thermal conductivity, part size, and molding rate.&quot; Below is a table from page 243 of the same reference as previously mentioned that best illustrates the characteristics relevant to the power required for the most commonly used materials.

==Robotic moulding==
Automation means that the smaller size of parts permits a mobile inspection system to examine multiple parts more quickly. In addition to mounting inspection systems on automatic devices, multiple-axis robots can remove parts from the mould and position them for further processes.

Specific instances include removing of parts from the mould immediately after the parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, as well as the general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.

<doc id="325832" wikidata="Q3289825" url="?curid=325832" title="Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland">
<text>Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, PC (28 September 1705 – 1 July 1774) was an English peer and Whig politician who served as the Secretary at War from 1746 to 1755. He also held the offices of Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1755 to 1756 and Paymaster of the Forces from 1757 to 1765, enriching himself while holding the latter office. While Fox was widely tipped as a potential candidate for the office of Prime Minister, he never held the office. His third son was the Whig statesman Charles James Fox.

==Early life==
He was the second son of Sir Stephen Fox and his second wife the former Christiana Hope, and inherited a large share of his father&#x27;s wealth. He squandered most of it soon after attaining his majority, and went to Continental Europe to escape from his creditors. There he made the acquaintance of a woman of fortune, who became his patroness and was so generous to him that, after several years&#x27; absence, he was in a position to return home.

==Marriage and children==
In 1744 he eloped with and married the much younger Lady Caroline Lennox (1723–1774), the eldest daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond (1701–1750). The Duke of Richmond was the grandson of Charles II, the duke&#x27;s father having been the child of Charles and his mistress, Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth. Lady Caroline&#x27;s marriage caused a great scandal in high society. She was later created Baroness Holland, &quot;of Holland in the County of Lincoln&quot;. To his wife, Lord Holland bequeathed £2,000 per annum, with Holland House, Kensington, his plate, etc., but charged with various other legacies. As his residuary legatee it was estimated that she would be worth £120,000 in government securities, besides her jointure. However, she did not long survive him. By his wife he had children including:
*Stephen Fox, 2nd Baron Holland (1745–1774), eldest son and heir, of delicate health in his early childhood. Like his younger brother he was a notorious gambler. His father bequeathed him his Wiltshire estate, £5,000 per annum and £20,000 cash.
*Henry Charles Fox (1746–1746), second son, died in infancy.
*Charles James Fox (1749–1806), third but second surviving son, the noted Whig statesman and notorious gambler. He was born in Conduit Street, Mayfair, as his father&#x27;s new home of Holland House in Kensington, leased in 1746, was being redecorated. His father bequeathed him his Sheppy and Thanet estates in Kent, including Kingsgate, £900 per annum, and £20,000 cash.
*General Henry Edward Fox (1755–1811), youngest son, to whom his father bequeathed an estate in the North, £500 per annum, and £10,000 cash.

==Politics==

===Election===
In 1735 he entered Parliament as Member for Hindon in Wiltshire. He became a protégé and devoted supporter of Sir Robert Walpole, the long-standing Prime Minister, achieving unequalled and unenviable proficiency in the worst political arts of his master and model. He earned particular notice with a speech in parliament calling on Britain to support its European allies, principally Austria. He generally aligned with the government Whigs rather than the Patriot Whig faction that opposed them. Until 1742 this meant the government of Walpole but afterwards it was the government (1743–1754) of Henry Pelham to which he lent his support.

A skilled speaker, he was able to hold his own against Pitt himself. This helped him progress in the House of Commons, becoming an indispensable member of several administrations. He served as Surveyor-General of Works from 1737 to 1742, as Member for Windsor from 1741 to 1761 and as a Lord of the Treasury in 1743.

He had eloped with and married the much younger Lady Caroline Lennox, daughter of the Duke of Richmond, in 1744. She was later created Baroness Holland, of Holland in the County of Lincoln. The noted Whig politicians Charles James Fox and the 3rd Baron Holland were his son and grandson, respectively. Another son was the general Henry Edward Fox. He was known for his tendency to spoil his children, whom he allowed to mingle with the numerous public figures who came to dine at the Fox household. Charles would later grow up to be a politician of equal note to his father, many of whose policies and friendships he subsequently adopted although he tended more toward radicalism than the elder Fox.

===Secretary at War===

Fox was appointed Secretary at War and member of the Privy Council in 1746, at a time when Britain was engaged in the War of the Austrian Succession. At the time much of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy was dominated by the Duke of Newcastle, who also served as a &quot;de facto&quot; Defence Minister, with Fox acting largely as a deputy and being called upon to defend the government&#x27;s defence policy in the House of Commons.

During these years he became a close friend and confidante of the Duke of Cumberland, the King&#x27;s third and youngest son, who had become known for his suppression of the Jacobite rebellion of 1745. He had also gained fame on the Continent as military commander of Britain&#x27;s forces there. He had built himself a notable political following in London and, perhaps most importantly to Fox, offered a channel of communication to King George II of Great Britain. Fox soon grew to be a favourite of George II as well, who would in the future support his inclusion in governments in much the same way he would oppose Pitt&#x27;s membership

By the early 1750s, Fox and Pitt were both viewed as likely future leaders of the country. This pushed their rivalry to yet further lengths. Fox through his office as War Secretary was closer to the top office while Pitt languished in opposition. In 1754, the sudden death of Pelham brought their rivalry to a head. The new Prime Minister, Pelham&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Newcastle, needed a strong figure to represent him in the House of Commons. This job would command immense prestige and influence, and Pitt and Fox were considered the outstanding favourites to attain it.

Newcastle, fearing the relentless ambitions of both men, ultimately chose neither and instead selected Sir Thomas Robinson. To try to assuage Fox, Newcastle had first offered the post to him but with unacceptable conditions attached so that Fox would refuse the post, allowing Newcastle to offer it to his favoured candidate, Robinson.

Robinson, who was considered a nonentity, was poorly equipped to the task and struggled to defend the government from the strident attacks it now came under from Fox and Pitt, who were both angry at being spurned. By this point the government was facing a serious situation in America and Newcastle began to consider more seriously an alliance with either Pitt or Fox. Ultimately, he chose Fox in the belief that Pitt could be controlled less easily.

===Alliance with Newcastle===

Forced into the move by circumstances beyond his control Newcastle agreed the terms of the partnership with Fox. In 1755 Fox was given the dual roles of Leader of the House of Commons and Southern Secretary. The alliance between them was seen as the only way to forestall a similar proposed government including Pitt, who was considered a bitter enemy of both men. Newcastle could scarcely contain his growing distaste for Fox, who he considered grasping. Fox was heavily influenced by Cumberland, who favoured a strong response to a dispute with the French in the Ohio Country. The two men forced the policy on a more reluctant Newcastle.

It was decided to despatch a large British force under the command of Edward Braddock to America to drive the French out of Ohio Territory. Braddock&#x27;s column met with disaster in July 1755 and when news of this reached London, the pressure increased on Newcastle and Fox. Pitt mocked the inept handling of the crisis and suggested Britain was ill-prepared for a major war that might break out with the French over the issue. Ultimately war broke out with France the following year over the issue of its invasion of Prussia rather than the North American situation. Fox and Newcastle, realising that Menorca was severely vulnerable to a French attack, despatched a naval force to relieve the island.

The fleet was unable to prevent the Fall of Menorca, leading to a major public outburst against both its commander, Admiral Sir John Byng, and the government. Fox and Newcastle initiated a prosecution against Byng by accusing him of cowardice. Byng was later shot after a court martial for &quot;failing to do his utmost&quot;, a verdict that opponents of the government saw as a move to protect Newcastle and Fox from censure. Fox feared that he himself would be made the &quot;scapegoat&quot; blamed Newcastle for not giving Byng enough ships. On 13 October 1756, Fox resigned, fatally weakening Newcastle, whose ministry collapsed completely that November.

He was replaced by a government dominated by Pitt. However, Pitt had little control over most MPs and struggled to control the House of Commons. After a few months, the government collapsed in April 1757. The King wanted Newcastle and Fox to return, restoring their previous government, but by now, Newcastle felt a bitter hatred towards Fox over the Byng Affair, and refused to serve with him. A three-month spell followed in which Britain&#x27;s war effort was essentially leaderless. With the continued support of Cumberland, Fox retained high hopes of gaining the premiership. However, he could not come to a necessary agreement with either Pitt or Newcastle. In mid-summer, Pitt and Newcastle defied expectations, and formed a political partnership. Left out in the cold by this, Fox now turned his attentions instead to attaining a profitable position.

===Paymaster General of the Forces===
In 1757, in the rearrangements of the government, Fox was ultimately excluded from the Cabinet and given the post of Paymaster of the Forces. This office had a continuous history from 1662, when Henry Fox&#x27;s father, Sir Stephen Fox, had been the first tenant. Before his time, it had been the custom to appoint Treasurers at War &quot;ad hoc&quot; for specific campaigns; the practice of the Protectorate Government foreshadowed, however, a permanent office. Within a generation of the Restoration, the status of the Paymastership began to change. In 1692, the Paymaster, the Earl of Ranelagh, was sworn of the privy council; and thereafter, every Paymaster – or, when there were two Paymasters, at least one of them – was sworn of the council if not already a member. From the accession of Queen Anne, the Paymaster tended to change with the Ministry, and 18th century appointments must be considered as made not upon merit alone but by merit and political affiliation, the office becoming a political prize and perhaps potentially the most lucrative that a parliamentary career had to offer.

During the war, Fox devoted himself mainly to accumulating a vast fortune. The British Army expanded a great deal during these years, giving him further scope for irregularities. He collaborated with Nicholas Magens and George Amyand. By some estimates he was calculated to have amassed £400,000 in his eight years in the office, an average of £50,000 a year. Around 1760 he built the original Kingsgate Castle near Broadstairs, Kent, of which only the tower now remains.

In 1762, he again accepted the leadership of the House, with a seat in the Cabinet, under Lord Bute, and managed to induce the House of Commons to approve of the Treaty of Paris; as a reward, he was raised to the House of Lords as Baron Holland of Foxley in the County of Wilts, on 16 April 1763.

====Resignation====
In 1765, Fox was forced to resign the Paymaster Generalship, and four years later, a petition of the Livery of the City of London delivered by the Lord Mayor of London William Beckford against the Ministers referred to him as &quot;the public defaulter of unaccounted millions&quot;.

It was not the first time that he had been attacked on the financial conduct of his office. In 1763, in a debate opened by Sir John Phillips, William Aislabie had raised much the same issue in the Commons and was received with &#x27;loud marks of approbation&#x27;; but on this occasion, little public attention was aroused, and 1769 was the first time that it was taken up with vigour and outside parliament. The city&#x27;s address, like a Middlesex petition of the previous month, echoed charges made in the Commons when Alderman Beckford, the mouthpiece of many popular causes, had asserted that more than forty millions of public money remained unaccounted for in the army Pay Office and that legal process in regard to this had been issued from the exchequer but had been suspended by the king&#x27;s signed manual warrant. Beckford had called upon members of the Treasury Board then present to correct him if he had been misinformed, but not a word had been uttered.

The proceedings brought against him in the Court of Exchequer were delayed by a Royal Warrant; and he proved that in the delays in making up the accounts of his office, he had not broken the law. From the interest on the outstanding balances, he had nonetheless amassed a fortune.

===Later life===
He tried in vain to obtain promotion to an earldom, a title on which he had set his heart, and he died at Holland House, Kensington, a sorely disappointed man, with a reputation for cunning and unscrupulousness, the most unpopular politician of his day.

==Legacy==
When Fox had first arrived on the political scene, many had considered him as the greatest politician of his generation. Many saw him as a future Prime Minister, who could lead a revolution of the &quot;New Whigs&quot; against the old-style patriarchy of men like the Duke of Newcastle. In 1755 he had disappointed them first by making an alliance with Newcastle, and then in 1757 by turning his back on serious politics by accepting the Paymaster General post, a lucrative but unimportant post that signalled to many he was no longer a serious contender for high office. Rumours that he had misappropriated £400,000 during his eight years in the job did little to help his reputation as vain and mercenary and that he been under the influence of the notorious socialite Lady Etheldreda Townshend. Most depictions in popular culture have portrayed him in such a light.

His son Charles James Fox also became a leading light in the Whig party and many too considered him a future national leader. Fox, however, became associated with much the same sort of figures as his father had. In a strange parallel he was frustrated in his bid to become Prime Minister by that of Pitt&#x27;s younger son William Pitt the Younger who held the office for twenty years continuously, leaving Fox out in the wilderness in much the same way the Elder Pitt had done to Henry Fox.

In the 1999 British television series &quot;Aristocrats&quot; depicting the lives of the wealthy Lennox family during the 18th century, Fox was portrayed by Alun Armstrong.

<text>Joachim Joe Lynx (27 September 1898 - 1969) was a German journalist and author of several books on disparate subjects. In the 1920s he worked as a correspondent in Vienna, where he gathered material that he would later expand into books, &quot;The Prince of Thieves: A Biography of George Manolesco&quot; and &quot;The Great Hohenzollern Scandal&quot;. Of Jewish descent, he moved to England sometime in the 1930s, and stayed there for the rest of his life.

In 1943 he began work on a collection of essays, &quot;The Future of the Jews&quot;, planned for the first part of 1944. When it was finally published in mid-1945, it included an introduction by Thomas Mann, &quot;A Message&quot; from Edvard Beneš, and a dozen essays by contributors both Jewish and Gentile.

Lynx solicited an essay from Dorothy L. Sayers, the detective novelist and Christian apologist. Her work (actually, the second version she wrote) was accepted and got as far as galley proofs, but was then removed by demand of other contributors, under circumstances that are debatable. It has never been published.

After the Second World War Lynx published &quot;The Pen Is Mightier&quot;, a collection of cartoons from the war. At least one of the cartoons shows a great affection for the English and their endurance in the war.

His last work appears to have been &quot;The Great Hohenzollern Scandal&quot; (1965).

<doc id="325840" wikidata="Q2512965" url="?curid=325840" title="Ambulatory care">
<text>Ambulatory care or outpatient care is medical care provided on an outpatient basis, including diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment, intervention, and rehabilitation services. This care can include advanced medical technology and procedures even when provided outside of hospitals.

Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are health conditions where appropriate ambulatory care prevents or reduces the need for hospital admission (or &quot;inpatient&quot; care), such as diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Many medical investigations and treatments for acute and chronic illnesses and preventive health care can be performed on an ambulatory basis, including minor surgical and medical procedures, most types of dental services, dermatology services, and many types of diagnostic procedures (e.g. blood tests, X-rays, endoscopy and biopsy procedures of superficial organs). Other types of ambulatory care services include emergency visits, rehabilitation visits, and in some cases telephone consultations.

Ambulatory care services represent the most significant contributor to increasing hospital expenditures and to the performance of the health care system in most countries, including most developing countries.

==Scope==
Health care organizations use different ways to define the nature of care provided as &quot;ambulatory&quot; versus inpatient or other types of care.

Sites where ambulatory care can be delivered include:

* Doctor&#x27;s surgeries/Doctor&#x27;s offices/General medical practice: This is the most common site for the delivery of ambulatory care in many countries, and usually consists of a physician&#x27;s visit. Physicians of many specialties deliver ambulatory care, including specialists in family medicine, internal medicine, obstetrics, gynaecology, cardiology, gastroenterology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and geriatrics.
* Clinics: Including ambulatory care clinics, polyclinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and urgent care centers.
** In the United States, the Urgent Care Association of America (UCAOA) estimates that over 15,000 urgent care centers deliver urgent care services. These centers are designed to evaluate and treat conditions that are not severe enough to require treatment in a hospital emergency department but still require treatment beyond normal physician office hours or before a physician appointment is available. In Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, Feldsher health stations are the main site for ambulatory care in rural areas.
* Hospitals: Including emergency departments and other hospital-based services such as same day surgery services and mental health services.
** Hospital emergency departments: Some visits to emergency departments result in hospital admission, so these would be considered emergency medicine visits rather than ambulatory care. Most visits to hospital emergency departments, however, do not require hospital admission.
* Non-medical institution-based settings: Including school and prison health; vision, dental and pharmaceutical care.
* Non-institution settings: For example, mass childhood immunization campaigns using community health workers.
* Telemedicine: An expanding sector of ambulatory medicine that uses telecommunications and information technology to improve patient access to care; particularly those living in remote regions. Studies have suggested that telemedicine can be effective in delivering adequate patient care including older adults.
** Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries developed large scale telemedicine frameworks in effort to continue outpatient assessments and follow-ups across various specialties while minimizing the spread of COVID-19.

== Personnel and medical education ==

Ambulatory care services typically consist of a multidisciplinary team of health professionals that may include (but is not limited to) physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, and other allied health professionals.

Given the growth of ambulatory medicine, it has become a significant component of education for medical trainees across various specialties. Over the past decades, internal medicine residency programs across North America have made efforts to incorporate more ambulatory training to the medical education curriculum. The ambulatory medical training is focused on patient management through multidisciplinary teamwork while creating longitudinal continuity in patient care.

== Treatments ==
Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are illnesses or health conditions where appropriate ambulatory care prevents or reduces the need for hospital admission. Appropriate care for an ACSC can include one or more planned revisits to settings of ambulatory care for follow-up, such as when a patient is continuously monitored or otherwise advised to return when (or if) symptoms appear or reappear.

Relatively common ACSC include:

* Angina
* Asthma
* Cancer
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
* Chronic pain
* Congestive heart failure
* Dental conditions
* Diabetes
* Dyslipidemia
* ENT (Ear-nose-throat) diseases
* Epilepsy
* HIV
* Hypertension
* Inflammatory bowel disease
* Influenza, pneumonia and other vaccine-preventable diseases
* Iron-deficiency anemia 
* Palliative care
* Pelvic inflammatory disease
* Thromboembolic diseases
* Tuberculosis
Hospitalization for an ambulatory care sensitive conditions is considered to be a measure of access to appropriate primary health care, including preventive and disease management services. While not all admissions for these conditions are avoidable, appropriate ambulatory care could help prevent their onset, control an acute episode, or manage a chronic disease or condition. For Medicaid-covered and uninsured U.S. hospital stays in 2012, six of the top ten diagnoses were ambulatory care sensitive conditions.

== Safety ==
There have been concerns regarding the safety of ambulatory medicine. Some of the common potential sources of harm include errors to medications and diagnostics as well as breakdowns in communications and coordination of care. One major complication of ambulatory care that predisposes to patients to harm is the risk for missing appointments. Missed appointments are common, costly, and can lead to significant delays in both diagnosis and treatment.

Advancements in information technology (IT) have helped to address some safety concerns of ambulatory medicine by minimizing mismanagement of electronic health records (EHR), improving interoperability, and increasing health professionals communication. Some have raised the notion of designing health professionals payment policies with greater focus on safety in addition to patient volumes. Furthermore, strategies for increased patient and caregiver engagement have been heralded as potentially beneficial in both patient care as well as data gathering for patient safety.

<doc id="325846" wikidata="Q834843" url="?curid=325846" title="Ruby-throated hummingbird">
<text>The ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) is a species of hummingbird that generally spends the winter in Central America, Mexico, and Florida, and migrates to Canada and other parts of Eastern North America for the summer to breed. It is the most common hummingbird in eastern North America, having population estimates of about 35 million in 2021.

==Taxonomy==
The ruby-throated hummingbird was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Trochilus colubris&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the earlier account by Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; that had been published in 1729 and that by George Edwards in his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot; that had been published in 1743. The type locality is South Carolina. The specific epithet &quot;colubris&quot; is from the Spanish &quot;colibrí&quot; meaning &quot;hummingbird&quot;. The ruby-throated hummingbird is now placed in the genus &quot;Archilochus&quot; that was introduced in 1854 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

== Description ==
This hummingbird is from long and has an wingspan. Weight can range from , with males averaging against the slightly larger female which averages . Adults are metallic green above and grayish white below, with near-black wings. Their bill, at up to , is long, straight, and slender. 
Hummingbird legs are short and have feet with three toes pointing forward and one backward the hallux. The toes are formed as claws (image) with ridged inner surfaces to aid gripping onto flower stems or petals.
The middle toe is around . The ruby-throated hummingbird can only shuffle to move along a branch, although it can scratch-preen with its feet.

The species is sexually dimorphic. The adult male has a gorget (throat patch) of iridescent ruby red bordered narrowly with velvety black on the upper margin and a forked black tail with a faint violet sheen. The red iridescence is highly directional and appears dull black from many angles. The female has a notched tail with outer feathers banded in green, black, and white and a white throat that may be plain or lightly marked with dusky streaks or stipples. Males are smaller than females and have slightly shorter bills. Juvenile males resemble adult females, though usually with heavier throat markings. The plumage is molted once a year on the wintering grounds, beginning in early fall and ending by late winter.

===Population and status===
As of 2021, there were 34–36 million ruby-throated hummingbirds over their eastern North American breeding range, making this species the most populous of North American hummingbirds. Despite substantial population growth from 1970 through the early 21st century, numbers of ruby-throated birds declined by 17% over the census reported in 2021. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species in 2023, ruby-throated hummingbirds are listed as &quot;least-concern&quot; for risk of extinction, while numerous other common North American hummingbirds are in significant decline.

===Vocalization ===
The vocalizations of ruby-throated hummingbirds are rapid, squeaky chirps, which are used primarily for threats. For example, males may vocalize to warn another male that has entered his territory.

During the courtship displays, the male makes a rapid &quot;tik-tik tik-tik tik-tik&quot; sound with his wings. The sound is produced both during the shuttle display, at each end of the side-to-side flight. Also, the sound is made during dive displays. A second, rather faint, repeated whining sound is sometimes produced with the outer tail-feathers during the dive, as the male flies over the female, spreading and shutting the tail as he does so.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The breeding habitat is throughout most of the Eastern United States and south-central and southeastern Canada in deciduous and pine forests and forest edges, orchards, and gardens. The female builds a nest in a protected location in a shrub or a tree. Of all hummingbirds in the United States, this species has the largest breeding range.

The ruby-throated hummingbird is migratory, spending most of the winter in Florida, southern Mexico and Central America, as far south as extreme western Panama, and the West Indies. During migration, some birds embark on a nonstop 900-mile journey across the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean from Panama or Mexico to the eastern United States. The bird breeds throughout the eastern United States, east of the 100th meridian, and in southern Canada, particularly Ontario, in eastern and mixed deciduous and broadleaved forest. In winter, it is seen mostly in Mexico and Florida.

During migration southward in autumn along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, older male and female birds were better prepared for long-distance flight than first-year birds by having higher body weights and larger fuel loads.

== Behavior and ecology ==

Ruby-throated hummingbirds are . Adults of this species are not social, other than during courtship (which lasts a few minutes); the female also cares for her offspring. Both males and females of any age are aggressive toward other hummingbirds. They may defend territories, such as a feeding territory, attacking and chasing other hummingbirds that enter.

As part of their spring migration, portions of the population fly from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico across the Gulf of Mexico, arriving first in Florida and Louisiana. This feat is impressive, as an , non-stop flight over water would seemingly require a caloric energy that far exceeds an adult hummingbird&#x27;s body weight of . However, researchers discovered the tiny birds can double their fat mass in preparation for their Gulf crossing, then expend the entire calorie reserve from fat during the 20-hour non-stop crossing when food and water are unavailable.

Hummingbirds have one of the highest metabolic rates of any animal, with heart rates up to 1260 beats per minute, breathing rate of about 250 breaths per minute even at rest, and oxygen consumption of about 4 ml oxygen/g/hour at rest. During flight, hummingbird oxygen consumption per gram of muscle tissue is approximately 10 times higher than that seen for elite human athletes.

They feed frequently while active during the day. When temperatures drop, particularly on cold nights, they may conserve energy by entering hypothermic .

=== Flight ===
Hummingbirds have many skeletal and flight muscle adaptations which allow great agility in flight. Muscles make up 25–30% of their body weight, and they have long, blade-like wings that, unlike the wings of other birds, connect to the body only from the shoulder joint. This adaptation allows the wing to rotate almost 180°, enabling the bird to fly not only forward but backward, and to hover in mid-air, flight capabilities that are similar to insects and unique among birds.

The main wing bone, the humerus, is specifically adapted for hovering flight. Hummingbirds have a relatively short humerus with proportionally massive deltoid-pectoral muscles which permit pronounced wing supination during upstroke when hovering.

A hummingbird&#x27;s ability to hover is due to its small mass, high wingbeat frequency and relatively large margin of mass-specific power available for flight. Several anatomical features contribute further, including proportionally massive major flight muscles (pectoralis major and supracoracoideus) and wing anatomy that enables the bird to leave its wings extended yet turned over (supine) during the upstroke. This generates lift that supports body weight and maneuvering.

Hummingbirds achieve ability to support their weight and hover from wing beats creating lift on the downstroke of a wing flap and also on the upstroke in a ratio of 75%:25%, respectively, similarly to an insect. Hummingbirds and insects gain lift during hovering partially through inversion of their cambered wings during an upstroke. During hovering, hummingbird wings beat up to 80 times per second.

=== Food and feeding ===
Nectar from flowers and flowering trees, as well as small insects and spiders, are its main food. Although hummingbirds are well known to feed on nectar, small arthropods are an important source part of protein, minerals, and vitamins in the diet of adult hummingbirds. Hummingbirds show a slight preference for red, orange, and bright pink tubular flowers as nectar sources, though flowers not adapted to hummingbird pollination (e.g., willow catkins) are also visited. Their diet may also occasionally include sugar-rich tree sap taken from sapsucker wells. The birds feed from flowers using a long, extendable tongue and catch insects on the wing or glean them from flowers, leaves, bark, and spiders&#x27; webs.

Young birds are fed insects for protein since nectar is an insufficient source of protein for the growing birds.

=== Breeding ===

As typical for their family, ruby-throated hummingbirds are thought to be polygynous. Polyandry and polygynandry may also occur. They do not form breeding pairs, with males departing immediately after the reproductive act and females providing all parental care.

Males arrive at the breeding area in the spring and establish a territory before the females arrive. When the females return, males court females that enter their territory by performing courtship displays. They perform a &quot;dive display&quot; rising above and to each side of the female. If the female perches, the male begins flying in very rapid horizontal arcs less than in front of her. If the female is receptive to the male, she may give a call and assume a solicitous posture with her tail feathers cocked and her wings drooped.

The nest is usually constructed on a small, downward-sloping tree limb feet above the ground. Favored trees are usually deciduous, such as oak, hornbeam, birch, poplar or hackberry, although pines have also been used. Nests have even been found on loops of chain, wire, and extension cords. The nest is composed of bud scales, with lichen on the exterior, bound with spider&#x27;s silk, and lined with fibers such as plant down (often dandelion or thistle down) and animal hair. Most nests are well camouflaged. Old nests may be occupied for several seasons, but are repaired annually. As in all known hummingbird species, the female alone constructs the nest and cares for the eggs and young.

Females lay two (with a range of 1 to 3) white eggs about in size and produce one to two broods each summer. They brood the chicks over a period of 12 to 14 days, by which point they are feathered and homeothermic. The female feeds the chicks from 1 to 3 times every hour by regurgitation, usually while the female continues hovering. When they are 18 to 22 days old, the young leave the nest and make their first flight.

== Longevity and mortality ==

The oldest known ruby-throated hummingbird to be banded was 9 years and 1 month of age. Almost all hummingbirds of 7 years or more in age are females, with males rarely surviving past 5 years of age. Reasons for higher mortality in males may include loss of weight during the breeding season due to the high energetic demands of defending a territory followed by energetically costly migration.

A variety of animals prey on hummingbirds given the opportunity. Due to their small size, hummingbirds are vulnerable even to passerine birds and other animals which generally feed on insects. On the other hand, only very swift predators can capture them and a free-flying adult hummingbird is too nimble for most predators. Chief among their predators are the smaller, swifter raptors like sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, American kestrels and Mississippi kites as well as domestic cats, loggerhead shrikes and even greater roadrunners, all of which are likely to ambush the hummingbird while it sits or sleeps on a perch or are distracted by breeding or foraging activities. Predatory lizards and bird-eating snakes may also prey on the species, especially on its tropical wintering grounds. Even large, predatory invertebrates have preyed on ruby-throated hummingbirds, including praying mantises (which have been seen to ambush adult hummingbirds at hummingbird feeders on more than one occasion), orb-weaver spiders, and green Darners. Blue jays are common predators of nests, as are several other corvids in addition to some icterids, bats, squirrels and chipmunks.

<doc id="325852" wikidata="Q2006970" url="?curid=325852" title="Anguirus">
<text>is a fictional monster, or &quot;kaiju&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; (1955), the second film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. Anguirus is the first monster to be shown engaging in combat with Godzilla in a film. Since then, the character has appeared conversely as an enemy and an ally of Godzilla in numerous films produced by Toho, including &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; (1968), &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; (1972), &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot; (1973), &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot; (1974), and &quot;&quot; (2004). He has also appeared in other media, including comic books and video games.

==Overview==
===Appearance===
Anguirus is a quadrupedal giant or irradiated dinosaur that mostly resembles an ankylosaurus. His head resembles a cross between that of a ceratosaurus and a styracosaurus. He has several horns on the top of his head and a single horn above his nose. His face is long and drawn out, has rows of long, serrated teeth and has two tusks on his upper jaw. His carapace is studded with long, sharp spikes. Anguirus&#x27; tail is covered with spikes (he also had a tail club in &quot;Godzilla: Final Wars&quot;). His tail makes up most of his body length. His hind limbs are longer than his forelimbs, and he can stand up on them to his full height, though he generally walks upon all fours. Anguirus has not one but five brains, one in his head which controls all of his organs, and one above each one of his limbs; each brain most likely controls the limb it is above. This gives Anguirus an advantage in battle, for he can react much quicker than most kaiju. Anguirus first appears in the Showa continuity as brown with yellowish spines, these colors are later changed in the Millennium series to light gray, with orange spikes and horns.

===Powers and abilities===

In his first appearance in &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, it is explained that Anguirus is capable of moving incredibly fast in spite of his bulk due to his brain extending into his chest and abdominal areas, allowing him to react more quickly. He is able to lunge at his opponents with massive leaps, as seen in &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;, and is also capable of burrowing substantial distances. His long, burrowing journey started in &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot; and ended in &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;, in which he resurfaces underneath Mechagodzilla and battles until his jaw is broken by the robot. Two of his attacks involve jumping backward to impale his opponents on his spiked carapace in &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; and his vice-like bite; the most famous example of the latter being when he faced King Ghidorah in &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; and latched onto one of King Ghidorah&#x27;s necks, his grip holding firm even after the space monster took flight. Anguirus also has the ability to heal and regenerate in a few minutes, as executives said he recovered almost immediately after Mechagodzilla broke his jaw. Anguirus has incredible durability, surviving being stomped on, being kicked with immense robotic force, being dropped from high altitudes, and surviving Godzilla&#x27;s atomic ray.

In &quot;Godzilla: Final Wars&quot;, Anguirus had the ability to curl himself into a ball and propel himself forward with tremendous speed. The &quot;Final Wars&quot; version also possessed a spiked tail club like a real ankylosaurus, though it was not used in combat. He also had spikes on his legs.

Within &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, Anguirus&#x27; last roars, before being defeated by Godzilla, caused ultrasonic-like effect which produced cracks on Osaka Castle. Anguirus was also noted to be able to emit stunning poison from his claws and back spikes. Anguirus was also originally planned to breath an atomic ray in &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, and this was recorded in the official novelization of the film.

===Behind the scenes===

During the existence of the character, there have been three official Anguirus suits. The first and second were constructed under the supervision of Eiji Tsuburaya. After the release of &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, Toho was looking to release the movie to Western audiences but was having trouble finding a distributor. AB-PT pictures, an American distribution company, was producing their own movie &quot;The Volcano Monsters&quot; shortly after the release of &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;. AB-PT attempted to incorporate the monster footage of Toho&#x27;s film into their own, but had little success. They struck up a deal between the two companies; the second Godzilla suit and the original Anguirus suit were shipped to Los Angeles to film some additional scenes. Due to financial problems with AB-PT studios, the company collapsed and its assets were absorbed into other production companies. The second Godzilla suit and the original Anguirus suit both disappeared and remain lost to this day. The second suit, created for color filming, was built in 1968. The design had no radical changes from the original aside from some modification on the thickness of the spines and arrangement of the teeth. For &quot;Godzilla: Final Wars&quot;, a third suit was built incorporating modern sculpting methods and animatronics. The final suit is darker in color and somewhat more streamlined and biologically realistic in design. Angurius&#x27; roars were created by using the sounds of a saxophone, a harmonica, an oboe, and a tuba.

Anguirus has been played by multiple actors throughout the Godzilla movie series:
* &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; (first version) – Katsumi Tezuka
* &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; (second version) – Hiroshi Sekita
* &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; (second version) – Yukietsu Omiya
* &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot; (second version) – Yukietsu Omiya
* &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot; (second version) – Kin-ichi Kusumi
* &quot;Godzilla: Final Wars&quot; (third version) – Toshihiro Ogura

==History==
===Shōwa period (1955–1974)===
According to the English subtitles of &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, Anguirus, or &quot;Angilas&quot; as he was referred to in the film, was an &quot;Angilosaurus&quot;, a fictional dinosaur that lived from 150–70 million years ago and is described as &quot;one of the stronger dinosaurs that lived in the prehistoric era.&quot; Additionally, he is described in a textbook by Polish world animal specialist Plateli Hondon as &quot;one of the few creatures that had a thorough hatred for war-like predators&quot;. An individual &quot;Angilosaurus&quot; was awakened by the same hydrogen bombs that awoke Godzilla and battles him until he is killed by the latter. In the English-dubbed version of &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, &quot;Gigantis the Fire Monster&quot;, the name of the dinosaur is pronounced &quot;&quot;ANG-will-o-Saw-rus,&quot; and given the sub-moniker &quot;Killer of the Living&quot;. According to this version of the film, they ruled the Earth at one time, then disappeared suddenly. From an unnamed textbook in the movie, a scientist reads that the angilosaurs may return from hibernation due to radioactive fallout. Anguirus is also said to have &quot;brains in several parts of his body, including the head, abdomen, and the chest&quot;. Throughout both versions of the film, Anguirus battles Godzilla on several occasions until the latter eventually kills him.

Anguirus was reintroduced in &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; as an ally and best friend of Godzilla living with him on Monsterland, a role that Anguirus maintained throughout &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot;, &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot;, and &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;. Most notably, Anguirus helps Godzilla fight King Ghidorah and Gigan and attempts to fight Mechagodzilla on his own before the robot breaks his jaw in a bloody display, forcing him to retreat underground.

The Showa Anguirus was 60 meters (197 feet) tall, 100 meters (328 feet) long and weighed 30,000 metric tons.

===Millennium period (2004)===
Anguirus was intended to appear in the unmade film &quot;Godzilla X Varan, Baragon, and Anguirus: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;. However, Toho requested that director Shusuke Kaneko replace Anguirus and Varan with the more popular Mothra and King Ghidorah, respectively, leading to the release of the film &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;.

Anguirus returned in the 2004 film, &quot;&quot;, as a brainwashed pawn of the Xiliens. The aliens secretly dispatch Anguirus to attack Shanghai, where it battles the flying United Nations battleship, &quot;Karyu&quot;, until the Xiliens teleport Anguirus away to make humanity believe they had destroyed the monster. Once humanity discovers the Xiliens&#x27; true objective, the latter send fighters and Anguirus to destroy the &quot;Karyu&quot;. Following this, Anguirus, Rodan, and King Caesar are dispatched to confront Godzilla, but are ultimately defeated. 

In the English dub of the 2004 film during Anguirus&#x27; confrontation with the battleship &quot;Karyu,&quot; one crew member erroneously calls it &quot;the Angweenus.&quot; While this is only a translation error, it has been the subject of some fan affection.

The Millennium Anguirus was 90 meters (295 feet) tall, 160 meters (525 feet) long and weighed 60,000 metric tons.

=== Reiwa period (2017–2021) ===
In the prologue for the film &quot;&quot;, the corpses of Anguirus and Rodan make a cameo appearance, having been killed by a bio-weapon created by the Chinese military. This is expanded upon in the prequel novel &quot;Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse&quot;, in which Anguirus and Rodan attacked Beijing before they were killed by the bio-weapon, Hedorah. Additionally, two other members of Anguirus&#x27; species appear, with one attacking South Africa and the other killed by Godzilla in Los Angeles.

In the &quot;Godzilla Singular Point&quot; anime series, Anguirus scavenges several Rodan carcasses from a JSDF base in Chiba Prefecture&#x27;s forests and terrorizes the locals, with the local mayor&#x27;s son coining the monster&#x27;s name for his resemblance to ankylosaurs. After Anguirus hinders military responses with its ability to predict attacks and deflect projectiles by vibrating its spines, the JSDF, local hunters, and the Otaki Factory&#x27;s mecha Jet Jaguar join forces to lure out Anguirus. Upon discovering the creature can use quantum mechanics due to its extra-dimensional composition to predict the future, they temporarily stun it with a harpoon gun, but it attacks the mayor&#x27;s photoshoot, leading to Jet Jaguar killing Anguirus with a point-blank harpoon shot. The mecha&#x27;s inventor later takes one of Anguirus&#x27; horns as a trophy and to fashion into a spear for Jet Jaguar.

=== MonsterVerse (2019) ===
Skeletal remains resembling Anguirus make a cameo appearance in the film &quot;&quot; within an ancient sunken city that houses Godzilla&#x27;s lair.

<text>The Stryker is a family of eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicles derived from the Canadian LAV III. Stryker vehicles are produced by General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada (GDLS-C) for the United States Army in a plant in London, Ontario. It has four-wheel drive (8×4) and can be switched to all-wheel drive (8×8).

The Stryker was conceived as a family of vehicles forming the backbone of a new medium-weight brigade combat team (BCT) that was to strike a balance between armored brigade combat teams (heavy armor) and infantry brigade combat teams. The service launched the Interim Armored Vehicle competition, and in 2000, the service selected the LAV III proposed by GDLS and General Motors Defense. The service named this family of vehicles the &quot;Stryker&quot;.

Ten variants of the Stryker were initially conceived, some of which have been upgraded with v-hulls.

==Development history==

===Interim Armored Vehicle competition===

In October 1999, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki outlined a transformation plan for the Army that would allow it to adapt to post–Cold War conditions. The plan, named &quot;Objective Force&quot;, would have the army adopt a flexible doctrine that would allow it to deploy quickly, and be equipped for a variety of operations. An early phase of the plan called for the introduction of an Interim Armored Vehicle (IAV), which was intended to fill the capability gap between heavier and heavily armed, but not easily deployable, vehicles, such as the M2 Bradley, and easily deployable vehicles that are lightly armed and protected, such as the Humvee.

The IAV was intended as an interim vehicle until light air-mobile vehicles from the Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles program came online, none of which did before the program was canceled.

====Team General Dynamics–General Motors====
In February 2000, General Dynamics and General Motors announced they were partnering to enter the IAV competition. The agreement built off earlier cooperative effort: In January 1999, General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS)–Canada integrated its Low Profile Turret (LPT) onto an assault gun version of the LAV III. The General Motors Defense–General Dynamics Land Systems team was awarded the $8 billion contract in November 2000 to produce 2,131 vehicles of a variant of the Canadian LAV III, for equipping six rapid deployment Brigade Combat Teams by 2008. United Defense protested the contract award in December, saying that their proposal cost less than half that of GM–GDLS. The General Accounting Office rejected the protest in April 2001.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army Paul J. Hoeper called the IAV &quot;the best off-the-shelf equipment available in the world in this class&quot;, though many in the Army openly wondered whether the vehicles were underclassed compared to the vehicles they might face in battle. In February 2002, the Army formally renamed the IAV as the &quot;Stryker&quot; after two unrelated U.S. soldiers who posthumously received the Medal of Honor: Private First Class Stuart S. Stryker, who died in World War II, and Specialist Four Robert F. Stryker, who died in the Vietnam War.

===Production===
In 2002, as the Stryker program faced criticism from lawmakers, including former Congressman Newt Gingrich, Pentagon officials mulled reducing the number of planned Stryker Brigade Combat Teams from six to three for a cost savings of $4.5 billion. In October, the Stryker&#x27;s C-130 air mobility was demonstrated for lawmakers at Andrews Air Force Base. At the Association of the United States Army, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki defended the six-brigade plan and boasted that the C-130 could carry a Stryker &quot;every way but sideways&quot;.

Four brigades were funded in the DoD&#x27;s budget proposal for fiscal year 2004, with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld deferring a decision on two additional until July 2003. In May, the Army readied the Stryker for initial operating capability at Fort Polk. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the swiftness with which the program had proceeded from its inception in 1999.

In November 2003, 311 Stryker vehicles were deployed in the Iraq War, where they saw mixed success. Never designed for frontline combat, the vehicles were pressed into counterinsurgency roles for which there was an unmet need.

Unexpectedly fierce resistance by insurgents prompted field upgrades to the vehicle&#x27;s armor. To counter the threat of rocket-propelled grenades, General Dynamics developed slat armor, which added 5,000 lb (2,270 kg) to the Stryker&#x27;s total weight. In addition to hindering mobility in the field, the heavy slat armor made transporting the Stryker via C-130 impossible.

In February 2005, Army Chief of Staff General Peter J. Schoomaker told the House Armed Services Committee that &quot;we&#x27;re absolutely enthusiastic about what the Stryker has done.&quot; However, a leaked U.S. Army report from December 2004 said the Stryker was &quot;effective and survivable only with limitations for use in small-scale contingencies.&quot; The report, which drew from feedback from Stryker personnel in Mosul, described a litany of design flaws, and said the effectiveness of the vehicles was &quot;getting worse, not better.&quot;

The Stryker 105 mm M1128 mobile gun system (MGS) moved into low-rate initial production in 2005 for evaluation, and entered full production in 2007. General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada assembles the Stryker for the U.S. Army in a plant in London, Ontario.

The vehicle is employed in Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, light and mobile units based on the brigade combat team doctrine that relies on vehicles connected by military C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) networks.

General Dynamics&#x27;s Robotic Systems division was developing autonomous navigation for the Stryker and several other vehicles with a $237 million contract, until the program was cut in July 2011. The Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) has tested an active magneto rheological suspension, developed by MillenWorks for the Stryker, at the Yuma Proving Ground, which resulted in greater vehicle stability.

In 2011, over 1,000 Stryker vehicles had been rebuilt by the Anniston Army Depot and returned to operations.

===Upgrades===
Throughout its years in service, the Stryker has undergone various survivability upgrades and received &quot;kit&quot; applications designed to improve the vehicle&#x27;s ability to withstand attacks.

The US Army plans to improve its fleet of Stryker vehicles with the introduction of improved semi-active suspension, modifications reshaping the hull into a shallow V-shaped structure, to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Included are additional armor for the sides, redesigned hatches to minimize gaps in the armor, blast-absorbent, mine-resistant seating, non-flammable tires, an upgrade to the remote weapon station that allows it to fire while moving, increased 500 ampere electrical generation, a new solid-state power distribution system and data bus, and the automotive and power plant systems improvements to support one-fourth greater gross vehicle weight. The upgraded V-hull will be part of the new StrykShield situational awareness kit, which will address many of these upgrades. Allegheny Technologies&#x27; ATI 500-MIL armor steel was designated the primary armored plating for the StrykShield package in 2008.

The upgrade incorporating lessons learned from combat in Afghanistan is designated LAV-H. General Dynamics had a technology demonstrator displayed at the 2007 Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Exposition. In March 2010, it was reported that General Dynamics and Army were working to incorporate a double V-hull into the Stryker design. In July 2010 the Army awarded a $30 million contract to GDLS to start production of the new hull.

In March 2011, the Department of Defense&#x27;s director of operational test and evaluations testified that the new V-hull design was &quot;not suitable&quot; for long missions in Afghanistan&#x27;s terrain. The issues are due to the tight driver&#x27;s compartment and difficulty releasing the seat to extract an incapacitated driver. General Dynamics stated these issues would be corrected before the deployment of the new Stryker version. The upgrade added significant weight to the vehicle, which can cause it to sink into soft ground.

In July 2011, 450 Double V-Hull (DVH) variants of the Stryker were ordered. The total was increased to 742 a few months later and then to 760 in 2012. DVH Strykers include a new hull configuration, increased armor, upgraded suspension and braking systems, wider tires, blast-attenuating seats, and a height management system.
By August 2012, the Army&#x27;s Stryker fleet included over 4,187 vehicles, with 10 flat-bottom variants and seven in double V-hull designs. In Afghanistan, it retained a 96 percent readiness rate. To upgrade the existing fleet, the Army has implemented an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) program to provide a stronger engine, improved suspension, more onboard electrical power, and next-generation networking and computing technology.

Phase 1 of the ECP includes an electrical power upgrade by replacing the extant 570 amp alternator with a higher current 910 amp alternator, replacing the existing 350 horsepower engine with a 450-horsepower engine, a stronger suspension system to improve mobility at higher weights, and an in-vehicle network to improve data and video sharing between crew stations and more secure and reliable data sharing between vehicle systems. In May 2013, Kongsberg Integrated Tactical Systems was awarded a contract to supply the Driver&#x27;s Situational Awareness Display (DSAD) and Commander&#x27;s Situational Awareness Display (CSAD) for the Stryker ECP program, featuring an onboard processor and additional I/O ports for both data and video.

As of January 2014, the U.S. Army had two Stryker Brigades that completed the DVH upgrade. A third brigade, the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Joint Base Lewis–McChord, was to be fully upgraded by the end of FY 2016. In mid-October 2014, the Army approved the procurement of DVH Strykers for a fourth Stryker brigade, with conversions to 360 vehicles to begin in FY 2017. The Strykers will be the first to receive ECPs to handle the upgrades better than the previous three brigade vehicles, which increased weight, decreased mobility, and added a power burden. Previous DVH-upgraded Strykers will get ECP enhancements when funding is available. ECP enhancements include a more robust 450 HP engine, a more powerful 910 amp power generator, a chassis upgrade to handle the new engine, and improvements to the vehicle&#x27;s internal network. In 2018, the Army Requirements Oversight Council approved the conversion of all flat bottomed Strykers to the DVHA1 standard. This will be done through a combination of upgrading existing Strykers and new built vehicles. The Army acquisition goal for the fleet of DVHA1 vehicles is 4,459 which will allow all Stryker Brigades to field the vehicle and other units within the army which use the vehicle like M-SHORAD and CBRN detection. Procurement is to last into the 2030s with procurement averaging 165 Strykers a year or roughly half of a Stryker brigades vehicle set.

Upgrading the fourth brigade also kept the production line active through 2018, whereas deciding to upgrade after the line had closed would be more difficult and costly to reopen it. The upgrades of the engine and power generator, suspension, and DVH designate the vehicle the Stryker-A1. The Army plans to increase the lethality of Stryker ICVs by having half equipped with a 30 mm cannon and the other half given a Javelin anti-tank missile on the existing RWS in each brigade. By September 2020, half of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division had fielded the third-generation Stryker DVHA1 variant.

===SHORAD===

In February 2018, the Army announced that Stryker vehicles would be modified with sensors and weapons to fulfill an interim Maneuver-Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) requirement. This is in response to a capability gap identified in Europe against Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). With the previous focus on fighting in the Middle East, the U.S. Army had neglected SHORAD capabilities. In future conflicts, it is feared they would not be able to rely on air dominance to counter enemy aircraft. In addition to deploying AN/TWQ-1 Avengers and fielding man-portable Stinger missiles, Strykers are to be upgraded to buy time to build a lasting mobile air defense solution.

Because the unarmored Humvee-based Avenger lacks survivability and range to keep up with maneuver forces and hold off enemy aircraft in contested territory, four battalions totaling 144 Stryker SHORADs are planned, with the first battery of 12 systems fielded in 2020. The Stryker platform was chosen because it has better protection and in regards to size, weight and power considerations, especially for the possibility of integrating a directed energy weapon in the future. The first unit to be equipped with them will be the 4th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery Regiment. The Army planned to select the weapons configuration to be fitted onto the vehicle in late 2018.

In June 2018, the Army chose Leonardo DRS to supply the mission equipment package, which partnered with Moog Inc. to integrate the Reconfigurable Integrated-weapons Platform (RIwP) onto the vehicle. The system can be fitted with a Stinger pod and Longbow Hellfire missile rails and comes equipped with a 30 mm M230LF chain gun and the 7.62 mm M240 coaxial machine gun, as well as non-kinetic defeat capabilities and a RADA Electronic Industries onboard Multi-Mission Hemispheric Radar (MHR).

The Army chose DRS because of the flexibility of the reconfigurable turret to allow for growth opportunities and alternate weapon options. It posed less intrusion to the existing vehicle platform, as they have a desire to keep the Stryker as common across the fleet as possible, and it provided increased protection as the crew can reload ammunition under armor. All 144 M-SHORAD systems are planned to be delivered by 2022.

The turret can mount one four-shot Stinger pod or two Hellfire missiles on either side. Reloading of the M230LF and Stingers can be done through roof hatches giving partial protection. The system can act in a secondary anti-vehicle role, as the 30 mm cannon is larger than the 25 mm gun mounted on the M2 Bradley and the Hellfire has greater range than TOW missiles typically used by ground vehicles.

In September 2020, the Army awarded General Dynamics the IM-SHORAD contract worth $1.2 billion, to deliver 144 vehicles over five years. The first order was for 28 vehicles for $230 million. The first four Stryker M-SHORAD vehicles were deployed to Germany in April 2021 as part of the 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment under the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command. A full battalion will be fielded in September 2021.

In 2024, the M-SHORAD air defense vehicle based on the Stryker platform was officially named the Sergeant Stout after the only Air Defense Artillery Soldier to receive the Medal of Honor, Mitchell W. Stout.

====DE M-SHORAD====
The Army began an effort to put a laser on an M-SHORAD vehicle during 2019. A combat shoot-off of laser-equipped Strykers facing realistic scenarios was conducted in July 2021, after which Raytheon was awarded a contract to supply a platoon of four vehicles each equipped with a 50 kW laser to defend against Group 1-3 UAS and rocket, artillery, and mortar (RAM) threats. The first two Directed Energy Maneuver-SHORAD Strykers were delivered in early 2023 for training with soldiers. A second platoon is planned to be ordered later in 2023, with the program to transfer to a program of record in 2025 and a competition to open up to produce the DE M-SHORAD capability. Four DE M-SHORAD Strykers were deployed to the Middle East in February 2024 for real-world testing.

==Design==
The Stryker is based on the LAV III light armored vehicle, which was based on the LAV-25 series.

The vehicle comes in several variants with a common engine, transmission, hydraulics, wheels, tires, differentials and transfer case. The M1130 command vehicle and M1133 medical evacuation vehicle have an air conditioning unit mounted on the back. The medical vehicle has a higher-capacity generator. A recent upgrade program provided a field retrofit kit to add air conditioning units to all variants. Production started in 2005 on the Mobile Gun System, mounting an overhead General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) 105 mm automatic gun called the M1128 mobile gun system.

===Engine and mechanical features===
For its powerpack the Stryker uses a Caterpillar diesel engine common in U.S. Army medium-lift trucks, eliminating additional training for maintenance crews and allowing the use of common parts. Because of obsolescence concerns, the Caterpillar 3126 engine was recently replaced by a Caterpillar C7 engine and the Allison 3200SP transmission.

Pneumatic or hydraulic systems drive almost all of the vehicle&#x27;s mechanical features. For example, a pneumatic system switches between 8×4 and 8×8 drive.

Designers strove to ease the maintainer&#x27;s job, equipping most cables, hoses, and mechanical systems with quick-disconnecting mechanisms. The engine and transmission can be removed and reinstalled in approximately two hours, allowing repairs to the turbocharger and many other components to be done outside the vehicle.

===Command, control, and targeting===

Extensive computer support helps soldiers fight the enemy while reducing friendly fire incidents. Each vehicle can track friendly vehicles in the field as well as detected enemies. The driver and the vehicle commander, who also serves as the gunner, have periscopes that allow them to see outside the vehicle without exposing themselves to outside dangers. The vehicle commander has access to a day-night thermal imaging camera which allows the vehicle commander to see what the driver sees. The vehicle commander has an almost 360-degree field of vision. The Stryker vehicle is equipped with advanced camera systems to enhance driver visibility in various conditions. The AN/VAS–5 Driver’s Vision Enhancer (DVE), a compact thermal camera with a high-resolution infrared sensor, provides a 50-degree field of view for effective navigation in low-visibility environments such as fog, smoke, and dust. On the M1296 Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICV-D), this system has been replaced by the DVE-Wide, which provides a 107-degree horizontal field of view. The DVE-Wide cameras are mounted around the hull, collectively enabling a full 360-degree view for the crew, significantly improving situational awareness. Both systems feature image stabilization to counteract shock and vibration, while their ruggedized displays ensure reliability in demanding tactical environments. The U.S. Army is also working to integrate the DVE-Wide cameras on the Stryker with the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) to give the crew and dismounts a 360-degree view around the vehicle with all doors and hatches closed. Soldiers can practice training with the vehicles from computer training modules inside the vehicle.

General Dynamics Land Systems is developing a new Power and Data Management Architecture to handle computer upgrades.

The Stryker&#x27;s thermal sights can see out to , compared to for night vision sights used by dismounted soldiers. This capability allows the vehicle to warn dismounted soldiers of threats which lie beyond the range of their night vision sights.

===Protection===
The Stryker&#x27;s hull is constructed from high-hardness steel which offers a basic level of protection against 14.5 mm rounds on the frontal arc. It has all-around protection against 7.62 mm ball ammunition. Strykers are equipped with bolt-on ceramic armor which offers all-around protection against 14.5 mm armor-piercing ammunition, and artillery fragments from 155 mm rounds.

Problems were encountered with the initial batch of ceramic armor when it was found that a number of panels failed in tests against 14.5 mm ammunition. Army officials determined that this was due to changes in the composition and size of the panels introduced by their manufacturer, IBD Deisenroth. A stopgap solution of adding another 3 mm of steel armor was introduced until a permanent solution could be found. The issue was resolved in 2003 when DEW Engineering was selected as the new, exclusive supplier for the ceramic armor.
In addition to the integral ceramic armor, optional packages have been developed. These include slat armor and Stryker reactive armor tiles (SRAT) for protection against rocket propelled grenades and other projectiles, the hull protection kit (HPK), armored skirts for additional protection against improvised explosive devices, and a ballistic shield to protect the commander&#x27;s hatch.

The Army began sending reactive armor tiles to Strykers in Iraq in 2004, as well as tiles for Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Tiles have to be specifically crafted for each vehicle type they are fitted to. Insurgents attempted to counter reactive armor by having teams fire multiple RPGs at once, but at close range these groups could be engaged and broken up. Reactive armor can be defeated by tandem-charge weapons like the RPG-29 or by explosively formed penetrators, although the Bradley&#x27;s tiles can withstand EFPs. In 2005, slat armor for the Stryker vehicles was designed and developed by the Army Research Laboratory and the Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland to further protect them from RPGs.

The cage is placed 50 cm ahead around the vehicle to provide adequate protection. The slat armor on the Stryker vehicles is effective against HEAT rounds. In May 2009, General Dynamics and Rafael won a contract to provide SRAT tiles to replace slat armor on Strykers. The additional weight of the two systems is comparable, but reactive armor tiles offer greater vehicle stability and maneuverability and &quot;assured&quot; rather than &quot;statistical&quot; protection.

The Stryker incorporates an automatic fire-extinguishing system with sensors in the engine and troop compartments that activate one or more halon fire bottles, which can also be activated by the driver, externally mounted fuel tanks, and a CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) Warfare system which will keep the crew compartment airtight and positively pressurized.

Reports from military personnel and analysts state that the Stryker&#x27;s is better able to survive IEDs than other light military vehicles.

In spring 2016, a Stryker regiment deployed to Europe with the Saab mobile camouflage system (MCS), which both changes its physical appearance to better blend into the environment and incorporates properties that improve signature management against long-wave and mid-wave thermal sensors, near-wave and short-wave infrared, and radar. Further tests will influence the Army to decide whether to pursue acquiring the camouflage system through a Program of Record.

In 2016, Artis LLC&#x27;s Iron Curtain active protection system was selected for integration onto the Stryker as an interim system, until the Army develops the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS). Iron Curtain differs from other APS by defeating projectiles just inches away from the vehicle, rather than intercepting them several meters out. In August 2018 the Army decided not to continue qualifying Iron Curtain onto the Stryker due to maturity issues with the system.

===Armament===
With the exception of some specialized variants, the primary armament of the Stryker is a Protector M151 Remote Weapon Station with 12.7 mm (.50 in) M2 machine gun, 7.62 mm M240B machine gun, or 40 mm Mk 19 grenade launcher. The choice of armament was driven by many factors. The US Army wanted a vehicle that could rapidly transport and protect infantry to and around battlefields.

In September 2017, Raytheon fired Stinger missiles it had integrated into a Stryker-mounted Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) to intercept airborne targets in a demonstration, turning the vehicle into a short-range air defense system. By early 2024, the Army had deployed three battalions of Stinger-equipped Strykers.

In August 2018, 86 Strykers began fielding with a CROWS turret adapted to be able to fit a FGM-148 Javelin tube, allowing the vehicle to fire the weapon instead of needing dismounted troops to use it.

====30 mm cannon====
While the Stryker MGS gives medium brigades heavy firepower, the baseline infantry carrier vehicle has a light armament. Stryker program officials pursued mounting a 30 mm cannon to the ICV&#x27;s remote weapons station. With the number of MGS vehicles per brigade being reduced, individual ICVs are to be up-gunned. The cannon will give greater firepower without needing to add a turret. The plan was to purchase and test a company set of 30 mm cannons and determine if they should be issued for every Stryker or have one per company.

The Army planned to test stabilized 30 mm cannons in early 2014, including Kongsberg Protech Systems&#x27; Medium Caliber Remote Weapons Station (RWS). Kongsberg, which makes the Stryker&#x27;s M151 RWS joined with Stryker manufacturer, General Dynamics for the MCRWS in 2008. The MCRWS is not a true turret, which would extend into the crew compartment and take up space. It can be loaded from inside the vehicle, but does eliminate one of the four roof hatches.

The autocannon is fed by two magazines holding armor piercing and high explosive ammunition. Each carries 78 rounds. Another 264 rounds are stored in the hull. Test firings of a 30 mm cannon in the Kongsberg MCRWS occurred on a Stryker demonstrator vehicle in February 2014. The cannon showed increased lethality and accuracy over the standard 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine gun, at ranges of . Four rounds in five-round bursts hit the targets.

After comparative testing of the Kongsberg MCRWS mounted to Stryker vehicles, the U.S. Army approved in April 2015 the equipping of 81 of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment&#x27;s Strykers with 30 mm cannons after the unit requested the upgrade. Reviews of the effectiveness of these new turrets in Stryker companies informed decisions regarding the upgrade of more Strykers across the nine Stryker Brigades. The remote turret requires a modification of the hull roof, and adds two tons of weight with an upgraded suspension and wider tires. Outfitting the first Strykers with Mk44 Bushmaster II cannons was planned to occur during the next two years, it was stated in 2015.
The cannon, which can engage light armored vehicles out to . is able to fire airburst rounds that explode above a target to hit enemy troops behind barriers and can defend against unmanned aerial vehicles. The Kongsberg turret and Orbital ATK XM813 variant of the Mk44 Bushmaster were officially selected in December 2015. Kongsberg later renamed the turret system the &quot;RT40&quot; (&quot;Remote Turret&quot;). The first upgraded Stryker, designated XM1296 &quot;Dragoon&quot;, was delivered for testing in October 2016, with fielding to begin in May 2018. The first Infantry Carrier Vehicle – Dragoon (ICVD) was delivered to the 2CR in Germany in December 2017.

In April 2019, the Army decided to add cannon armament to Stryker DVH ICVVA1 vehicles in three brigades. The first is planned to be equipped in 2022. In June 2021, the Army chose Oshkosh Defense to supply its Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS). The previous GDLS/Kongsberg team which supplied turrets to the 2nd Cavalry Regiment competed in the full-and-open competition but was not chosen to deliver more. The June contract award is worth up to $942 million over six years. As of the award date, the Army had approved plans to outfit three brigades with 83 Medium Caliber Weapon Systems (MCWSs) each. The contract covers up to six brigades worth of vehicles if the service decides that is how it wants to proceed.

The initial order calls for 91 vehicles for approximately US$130 million. The Army will provide the Oshkosh-led team with the vehicles and the XM813 cannon for integration. In August 2021, Oshkosh received an additional US$99 million to cover the modification of 83 further vehicles, bringing the total number of vehicles under contract to 174. The Oshkosh team provides a turret based on Rafael&#x27;s Samson family of turrets but customized for the Army.

On September 26, 2024, a $78.5 million production contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman Defense Systems for the XM1182 High Explosive Airburst with Tracer (HEAB-T), designed for the ICVVA1-30mm Stryker. Developed for the XM813 weapon system, the XM1182 achieved Milestone B in March 2020 and Milestone C in 2023, following an aggressive development timeline. This advanced round features multi-mode functionality, including airburst (AB) to engage personnel in open or defilade positions, point detonate (PD) to defeat unarmored vehicles, point detonate delay (PDD) to penetrate urban structures or vehicles before detonation, and self-destruct (SD) to reduce unexploded ordnance hazards. Additionally, the XM1182 HEAB-T includes an advanced warhead with increased fragmentation, providing a larger lethal footprint and improved penetration of urban structures. Complementing the XM1182, the XM1170 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer (APFSDS-T) enhances the Stryker&#x27;s capabilities with improved armor penetration at extended ranges, utilizing a depleted uranium (DU) penetrator in place of the previous Tungsten-Nickel-Cobalt penetrator. Both rounds are vital upgrades for the U.S. Army’s Stryker Brigade Combat Teams.

===Mobility===

====Strategic and operational====
One of the key objectives outlined as part of the Army transformation plan was the ability to deploy a brigade anywhere in the world within 96 hours, a division in 120 hours, and five divisions within 30 days. Operational mobility requirements dictated that the vehicle be transportable by C-130 aircraft and that it would be able to roll-off manned and ready to fight.

The Stryker&#x27;s suitability for C-130 transport has led to criticism that the aircraft&#x27;s range may not meet the 1,000-mile goal. The aircraft&#x27;s range depends on variables such as the C-130 variant and conditions at the departure airport. In a demonstration conducted in April 2003, a Stryker infantry company with 21 Stryker vehicles was transported by C-130s to another airport 70 miles away. This proved that the vehicle can be transported by C-130, but did not address the concerns regarding range and airport departure conditions. When equipped with slat armor the Stryker is too large to fit on a C-130, but RPG protection was not a requirement for C-130 transport. The Airbus A400M Atlas was being tested for compatibility with the Stryker in Autumn 2015.

The Stryker is too heavy, 19–26 tons, depending on variant and add-on features, to be lifted by existing helicopters.

In August 2004, testing was conducted to determine if the Stryker MGS could be airdropped. This testing started with a series of 12-foot drop tests, followed by the US Air Force successfully airdropping an up-weighted Stryker Engineering Support Vehicle from a C-17. Even though this test was a success, none of the Stryker variants have been certified for airdrop. As of 2013 work continues in this area with the capability assumed for the Unified Quest war game.

====Tactical====
The Stryker can alter the pressure in all eight tires to suit terrain conditions: highway, cross-country, mud/sand/snow, and emergency. The system warns the driver if the vehicle exceeds the recommended speed for its tire pressure, then automatically inflates the tires to the next higher pressure setting. The system can warn the driver of a flat tire. The Stryker is equipped with run-flat tire inserts that also serve as bead-locks, allowing the vehicle to move at reduced speeds for several miles before the tire completely deteriorates.
Some criticism of the Stryker continues a decades-long ongoing debate concerning whether tracked or wheeled vehicles are more effective. Conventional tracks have superior off-road mobility, greater load capacity, can pivot a vehicle in place, and are more resistant to battle damage. Wheeled vehicles are easier to maintain, and have higher road speeds. The US Army chose the Stryker over tracked vehicles due to these advantages.

Rollover is a greater risk with the Stryker relative to other transport vehicles, due to its higher center of gravity. The Stryker&#x27;s high ground clearance, however, is likely to reduce the damage caused by land mines and IEDs on the vehicle.

While not amphibious, the Stryker has watertight combat hatch seals to allow fording water up to the tops of its wheels.

===Cost===
The unit cost to purchase the initial Stryker ICVs, without add-ons, including the slat armor, was US$3 million in April 2002. By May 2003, the regular production cost per vehicle was US$1.42 million. In February 2012, the cost had risen to US$4.9 million.

In 2013, media reports stated that the Stryker Project Management Office had ordered almost $900 million in unneeded or outdated parts due to a failure to control its inventory during the War on Terror.

===Mission===
A standard Stryker Brigade typically consists of: 130 Infantry Carrier Vehicles; 9 Anti-Tank Guided Missile Vehicles; 27 Medical Evacuation Vehicles; 12 Engineer Squad Vehicles; 32 Commander&#x27;s Vehicles; 36 120 mm Mounted Mortar Carriers; 56 Reconnaissance Vehicles; 13 Fire Support Vehicles; three NBC Reconnaissance Vehicles; and 12 105 mm Mobile Gun Systems.

The Stryker family of vehicles fills a role in the United States Army that is neither heavy nor light, but rather an attempt to create a force that can move infantry to the battlefield quickly and in relative security. Brigades that have been converted to the Stryker have primarily been light, or, in the case of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, unarmored Humvee-based cavalry scouts. For these units, the addition of Strykers has increased combat power by providing armor protection, a vehicle-borne weapon system to support each dismounted squad, and the speed and range to conduct missions far from the operating base.

Stryker units seem to be especially effective in urban areas, where vehicles can establish initial security positions near a building and dismount squads on a doorstep.

The Stryker relies on its speed and communications for the majority of its defense against heavy weapon systems. Most Stryker variants are not designed to engage heavily armored units, relying on communication and other units to control threats outside of its classification. One variant is armed with anti-tank missiles.

Brigades equipped with the Stryker are intended to be strategically mobile, i.e., capable of being rapidly deployed over long distances. As such, the Stryker was intentionally designed with a lower level of protection compared to tracked vehicles like the M2 Bradley, but with much lower logistic requirements.

Although the Stryker was designed to be rapidly deployable and not heavily armored, a training exercise in January 2014 demonstrated that in some circumstances, a Stryker brigade with vehicles and infantry using anti-tank missiles could successfully engage a conventional enemy force of tanks, armored vehicles, and helicopters.

==Service history==

===Deployments===
* Iraq War, 2003–2011:
** The first Stryker brigades were deployed to Iraq in October 2003. 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division from Fort Lewis was the first to field and deploy the Stryker vehicle to combat in Iraq from November 2003 to November 2004.
** 3rd Brigade was relieved by 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (SBCT). The 1st Brigade served in Iraq from October 2004 to October 2005. Units from this Brigade participated in the Battle of Mosul (2004) and were responsible for the first successful elections in January 2005. The Brigade was awarded the Valorous Unit Award for their tour in Iraq.
** The 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team from Fairbanks, Alaska&#x27;s Fort Wainwright began its initial deployment in August 2005 to Summer 2006. Their stay was subsequently extended for up to four months and they were reassigned to Baghdad. The Brigade was awarded the Valorous Unit Award for their tour in Iraq.
** The 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division re-deployed to Iraq late Spring of 2006 and returned home in September 2007. Like its sister brigades it too was awarded the Valorous Unit Award for operations in Baqubah, Iraq.
** As part of a three way move, upon redeployment from Iraq, the 1st Stryker Brigade, 25th Infantry Division and the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment both cased their colors. The former 1st SBCT, 25th ID was redesignated as the new 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment in Vilseck, Germany and the former 2nd ACR was redesignated as the new 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington. During the same period of time, upon redeployment from Iraq, the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team was deactivated and reactivated as the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, in Fort Wainwright, Alaska.
** In April 2007, the 4th Brigade 2nd Infantry Division deployed as part of the surge in Iraq. This deployment marked the first time the Stryker Mobile Gun System was deployed in Iraq. The Stryker MGS was initially deployed with 5 dedicated maintenance experts from General Dynamics Land Systems. They provided technical support and maintenance for the systems initial deployment. The team of 5 technicians played a pivotal role in support of the system and in troop training. A team of engineers was sent to support MGS operations, but this played a very minor role in the ultimate success of the weapons system. The 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment (MANCHU), deployed Land Warrior for the first time in combat.
** In August 2007, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment deployed to Baghdad for a 15-month tour, relieving 3rd BDE, 2ID.
** In December 2007, the 2nd Brigade 25th Infantry Division deployed to Iraq.
** In September 2008, 1-25th Infantry based in Fort Wainwright, Alaska was deployed to Iraq.

** In January 2009, the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division, from the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, was deployed to Iraq. The 56th SBCT was the first National Guard unit in the U.S. Army to field Strykers.
** In August 2009, 3rd Brigade 2nd Infantry Division was again deployed to Iraq for a third tour.
** In September 2009, 4th Brigade 2nd Infantry Division deployed to Iraq for a third tour. The Brigade drove &quot;The Last Patrol&quot; out of Iraq, driving from Baghdad to Kuwait, symbolizing the exit of the &quot;last combat brigade&quot; and ending Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Brigade was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for the tour in Iraq.
** In July 2010, 2nd Brigade 25th Infantry Division once again deployed to Iraq, relieving 3rd Brigade, 2nd ID. 2nd Brigade, becoming the first &quot;Advise and Assist&quot; Stryker brigade.

* War in Afghanistan, 2001–2021:
** The 5th Brigade 2nd Infantry Division was the first Stryker unit sent to Afghanistan, deployed in summer 2009, as part of a troop level increase. The brigade&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment suffered the heaviest losses of any Stryker battalion to date. The 5th Stryker Brigade&#x27;s losses during its one-year deployment were 37 killed and 238 wounded.
** In June 2010, the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment deployed to Afghanistan relieving 5th Brigade 2nd Infantry Division.
** In April 2011, 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division deployed to Afghanistan to relieve the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment.
** In November 2012, 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division deployed to Afghanistan to relieve 3-2 SBCT.
* Military intervention against ISIL, 2014–present:
** In March 2017, Strykers were seen operated by U.S. special forces operators near the northeastern Syrian town of Manbij.
* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, 2022–present:
** In January 2023, an aid package to Ukraine included the first Strykers to be sent to the country, containing 90 vehicles with 20 mine rollers. They first arrived in March and began being used in August in Zaporizhzhia Oblast by the 82nd Air Assault Brigade during the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive.
** On 21 September 2023, Ukrainian Strykers were operating on Surovikin Line, near Verbove, Zaporizhzhia Oblast for the first time.
** According to the Oryx blog, as of 23 October 2024, at least 17 M1126 Strykers were destroyed, 4 damaged and 4 captured. Another 7 M1132 Strykers were destroyed.

===Field reports===
Due to their use during the 2003–11 Iraq War, many reports have come back on the Stryker&#x27;s performance. Soldiers and officers who use Strykers defend them as very effective vehicles. A 2005 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article states that &quot;commanders, soldiers and mechanics who use the Stryker fleet daily in one of Iraq&#x27;s most dangerous areas unanimously praised the vehicle. The defects outlined in the report were either wrong or relatively minor and did little to hamper the Stryker&#x27;s effectiveness.&quot;

In the same article, Col. Robert B. Brown, commander of the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team), said that the Strykers saved the lives of at least 100 soldiers deployed in northern Iraq. The article states that the bolt-on slat armor is effective ballistic protection, which was the main flaw cited in 2009 by critics. A 2003 GAO report to Congress stated that the added weight of slat armor created a mobility limitation in wet conditions due to shortcomings in the vehicle&#x27;s suspension.

Reports from military personnel and analysts indicate the Stryker is superior to other light military vehicles of the US Army regarding survivability against IEDs (improvised explosive devices). Soldiers have anecdotally referred to Strykers as &quot;Kevlar Coffins&quot;.

The non-partisan Project on Government Oversight received unexpectedly positive reviews when it spoke to soldiers who served in Strykers:
&quot;The Stryker&#x27;s fantastic. It has incredible mobility, incredible speed...&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ve been hit by 84 suicide VBIEDs... the greater majority of soldiers walk away without even a scratch. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. If I were in any other type vehicle, I would&#x27;ve had huge problems,&quot; said Colonel Robert Brown, commander of the 1st Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division.

Maj. Doug Baker, executive officer of the 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment in 3/2 said, &quot;When you rolled out the gate, you were fairly confident that the vehicle was going to take care of you… I&#x27;m familiar with what a Bradley can do. It&#x27;s a fantastic vehicle, but I would take a Stryker over it in Iraq any day.&quot; Crew members of the Stryker Mobile Gun System attest to its &quot;seamless&quot; ability to fill the high-mobility niche between main battle tank and armored personnel carrier.

As of 2005, the Stryker vehicle logged more than 27 million combat miles, with operational readiness rates greater than 96 percent.

==Variants==
The Stryker chassis modular design supports a wide range of variants. The main chassis is the infantry carrier vehicle (ICV). The Stryker vehicles have the following variants:
* M1126 infantry carrier vehicle (ICV): The basic armored personnel carrier version, which provides protected transport for two crew and a nine-man infantry squad, and can support dismounted infantry. It weighs 19 tons; communications include text and a map network between vehicles. It can be armed with 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 40 mm Mk 19 grenade launcher or 7.62 mm M240 machine gun.
** M1126 infantry carrier vehicle DVH-Scout (ICVV-S): A reconnaissance version of the ICV fitted with an internally mounted long-range advance scout (LRAS) surveillance system and the double v-hull.
* M1127 reconnaissance vehicle (RV): A version used by RSTA squadrons and battalion scouts, moving throughout the battlefield to gather and transmit real time intelligence/surveillance for situational awareness. The RV&#x27;s purpose is to anticipate and avert threats, improving the brigade&#x27;s decisiveness and freedom of maneuver.

* M1128 mobile gun system (MGS): A version armed with an 105 mm M68A1E4 rifled cannon, a 7.62 mm M240 machine gun mounted coaxially, a 12.7 mm M2 commander&#x27;s machine gun and two M6 smoke grenade launchers. The M68A1E4 also features a muzzle brake to assist with recoil and an autoloader, a rare feature on US tank guns. The main gun provides direct fire in support of infantry, engaging stationary and mobile enemy targets, such as bunkers or armored vehicles to create a combined arms effect of overmatched firepower that improves survivability of the combat team. It has a rate of fire of six rounds per minute, and carries 400 rounds of 0.5 in (12.7 mm) caliber and 3,400 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition, and the same C4ISR communications and driver&#x27;s vision as the ICV. The MGS vehicle is a strengthened variant of the LAV III compared to the standard variant other Stryker vehicles are based on, but retains commonality across all vehicles in the family. The Stryker MGS was retired at the end of 2022, due in part to the expense and difficulty of maintaining and upgrading the autoloader.

* M1129 mortar carrier (MC): armed with Soltam 120 mm and Cardom recoil mortar system (RMS), this version provides indirect fire support to fellow infantry with screening obscurants, suppressive forces and on-call supporting fires including HE, illumination, IR illumination, smoke, precision guided, and DPICM cluster bombs. The XM395 precision guided mortar munition (PGMM) can be used to attack point targets at extended ranges with GPS guidance. Vehicles at battalion level also carry the 81 mm mortar for dismounted use, while company mortar vehicles carry the 60 mm mortar.
* M1130 commander&#x27;s vehicle (CV): This vehicle provides commanders with communication, data, and control functions to analyze and prepare information for combat missions; it can also link to aircraft antenna/power for planning missions while aboard transport aircraft. They are deployed as three vehicles per brigade headquarters, two per battalion headquarters and two per infantry company.
* M1131 fire support vehicle (FSV): This version is organic to maneuver companies and provides surveillance and communications (4 secure combat radio nets), with target acquisition/identification/tracking/designation being transmitted automatically to the shooting units.
* M1132 engineer squad vehicle (ESV): This vehicle provides mobility and limited counter mobility support. Integrated into the ESV are obstacle neutralization and lane marking systems and mine detection devices. The ESV with its attachments provides a partial solution to the obstacle clearance role, primarily for clearance of hastily emplaced mines on hard surfaces and rubble, plus will enable the Engineer squad to control future robotic based systems.

* M1133 medical evacuation vehicle (MEV): This is used as the en route care platform for brigade units, part of the battalion aid station, providing treatment for serious injury and advanced trauma as an integrated part of the combat forward formation. An attendant&#x27;s seat allows the attendant to change position and visually monitor all patients while the vehicle is in motion. Medical personnel must be seated for safety while the vehicle is in motion, but able to visually monitor patients. Geneva Convention markings can be masked/removed as required.

* M1134 anti-tank guided missile vehicle (ATGM): It is a missile vehicle armed with the TOW missile to reinforce the brigade&#x27;s infantry and reconnaissance, providing long-range anti-tank fires against armor beyond tank gun effective range. The separate anti-tank company can also be used to shape the battlefield, reinforce the infantry battalions and reconnaissance squadron (e.g. counter-reconnaissance), serve as a reserve, and of course may counterattack. Vehicle commanders independently locate secondary targets while the gunner is engaging the primary. After ready rounds are fired, crewman will need to rearm the launcher. A vehicle commander, gunner, loader, and driver operate the ATGM in a tactical environment and to carry equipment if the missile launcher is used in a dismounted mode.
* M1135 nuclear, biological, chemical, reconnaissance vehicle (NBCRV): This vehicle automatically integrates contamination information from detectors with input from navigation and meteorological systems and transmits digital NBC warning messages to warn follow-on forces. The core of the NBC RV is its onboard integrated NBC sensor suite and integrated meteorological system. An NBC positive overpressure system minimizes cross-contamination of samples and detection instruments, provides crew protection, and allows extended operations at MOPP 0.

* M1296 Dragoon: The Dragoon is the first variant of the Stryker family to be equipped as an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV). Modifications were made to the hull roof of the Stryker for installing a Kongsberg unmanned turret with an XM813 30 mm cannon, capable of firing airburst munitions. This added around two tons of weight to the vehicle. The new cannon has significantly increased lethality, range and accuracy over the previous M2 heavy machine gun.

===Double V-hull===

In response to poor performance against Improvised explosive devices (IEDs), the Army began manufacturing and retrofitting Stryker vehicles with a more survivable double V-hull designed underside. Seven Stryker versions are being produced in this configuration: the M1256 ICVV, M1252 MCVV, M1255CVV, M1251 FSVV, M1257 ESVV, M1254 MEVV and M1253 ATVV. Three variants are no longer in service: the M1127 reconnaissance vehicle is to be replaced by a scout variant of the ICVV (called the ICVV-S), the M1128 mobile gun system and the M1135 NBC reconnaissance vehicle have been removed.

=== Double V-hull A1 ===
The Double V-Hull A1 (DVH A1) is a modernized upgrade of the original Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) variants, addressing key performance and capability needs. It replaces the 350-horsepower engine of the original DVH with a more powerful 450-horsepower Caterpillar C9 engine, significantly enhancing mobility and reducing engine strain during demanding operations. The electrical system has been upgraded to a 910-amp alternator, supporting advanced electronics and future system integrations. Payload capacity has increased from 55,000 to 63,000 pounds, enabling greater versatility in carrying equipment and personnel. Enhanced situational awareness displays for both the driver and commander improve operational coordination and decision-making. The Stryker DVH-A1 vehicles have the following variants:

* M1251A1 FSVVA1: similar to the M1131 FSV, but with the improvements from the DVH-A1 modernization.
* M1252A1 MCVVA1: a DVH-A1 improved version of the M1129 mortar carrier. Armed with the Soltam 120 mm and Cardom recoil mortar system (RMS).
* M1253A1 ATVVA1: a DVH-A1 improved version of the M1134 ATGM. Equipped with a Precision Far Target Locator (pFTL), Image Enhancement (IE), an HD color camera, and an Upgraded TOW Missile Launcher (UTML), it can detect, identify, and engage targets at ranges exceeding 4.5 km with TOW missiles.
* M1254A1 MEVVA1: an improved version of the M1133 MEV, with DVH-A1 upgrades.
* M1255A1 CVVA1: a DVH-A1 improved version of the M1130 CV.
* M1256A1 ICVVA1: an improved version of the M1126 Stryker ICV, features a Double-V Hull A1 (DVH-A1) design and is equipped with an M153A4 CROWS-J, which can mount an FGM-148 Javelin missile in conjunction with either an M2 .50 caliber machine gun, M240 7.62 mm machine gun, or Mk-19 40 mm automatic grenade launcher.
* M1257A1 ESVVA1: a DVH-A1 improved version of the M1132 ESV. Equipped with a Surface Mine Plow, Magnetic Signature Duplicator, and an M153A4 CROWS-J with Javelin ATGM.
* M1304 ICVVA1-30mm: replaces the M1296 Dragoon, it has the same improvements as the other DVHA1 variants and is equipped with a new unmanned turret, based on the Rafael Samson Pro turret, which is armed with the 30mm XM813 Chain Gun and a coaxial 7.62mm M240C. The M1304 also features 3rd-generation thermal optics for both the gunner and commander that offer a hunter-killer function for day and night operations.

===Experimental===

* Stryker self-propelled howitzer (SPH): Army officials considered a self-propelled howitzer variant when drafting its requirements for the IAV program. Officials ultimately passed over the SPH requirement when it determined the service would be unable to afford the expense and risk. The service settled on the M198 howitzer for its artillery requirement, later to be replaced by the M777 howitzer that was then under development. General Dynamics later produced this variant with a turret and ammunition developed by Denel Land Systems. Work stopped after the successful November 2005 demonstration of the prototype.
* Stryker maintenance recovery vehicle (MRV): An armored recovery vehicle based on a Stryker hull. Equipped with a Rotzler TR 200 winch, Magnum 210M crane and hydraulic earth anchor.
* Tracked Stryker: For the Army&#x27;s Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program to replace the M113 APC, General Dynamics created a tracked version of the Stryker. The vehicle kept the highly survivable Double-V hull, and tracks were attached using externally mounted suspension. It was considerably heavier at 70,000 pounds (35 tons, 31,800 kg), but the tracked suspension could handle up to 84,000 lb (42 tons, 38,100 kg) to allow for additional armor, weapons, and cargo. Its powerplant offered 700 horsepower and the vehicle had greater than 60 percent commonality with wheeled Strykers. The Tracked Stryker also had greater fuel efficiency and a wider track for better mobility than the M113. With the suspension mounted externally and the elimination of axles, the Double-V hull&#x27;s survivability could have been even more effective, as the wheeled version required an interruption in the V-hull to accept axles. The Tracked Stryker was to have competed against the BAE Systems Turretless Bradley, but serious efforts on developing the tracked version never materialized because the cost needed to modify the vehicle to meet requirements was too high.
* Stryker launched assault bridge: German manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) proposed a bridgelaying version of the Stryker that enables tactical vehicles with little or no gap-crossing capabilities to move over divides. The -long bridge is carried atop the Stryker with hydraulic arms at the front position to launch it and have it in place within two minutes. It can support vehicles weighing up to 40 tons and allow them to cross gaps.
* Stryker mobile expeditionary high-energy laser (MEHEL): The Army is integrating a directed energy weapon onto the M1131 Fire Support Vehicle version to defend against Group 1 and 2 UAVs (up to -class) for mobile forces as the first-ever integration of an Army laser weapon onto a combat vehicle. In an April 2016 test, a 2 kW laser fired from the Stryker shot down 21 drone targets. The vehicle has an electronic warfare jamming system to scramble drone command signals. A 5 kW version could be operational in 2017, with plans to increase power to 18 kW by 2018.
* Stryker mobile SHORAD launcher (MSL) and Stryker anti-UAV defense system (AUDS): In August 2017, Boeing and General Dynamics unveiled mobile SHORAD launcher (MSL) fitted with an Avenger turret for short-range air defense and operated by a three-man crew. The turret replaces the passenger compartment. Standard FIM-92 Stinger pod can be switched with launcher rails to fire Longbow Hellfire and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. In October 2017, Orbital ATK unveiled the Stryker Anti-UAV Defense System (AUDS), combining electronic-scanning radar target detection, EO tracking/classification, and directional RF inhibition capability coupled with a M230LF 30 mm cannon loaded with advanced airburst and guided ammunition suite. The package creates a mobile C-UAV system capable of lethally or non-lethally defeating small drones at ranges of up to , and can defeat Group 1 micro UAVs as far as out. The system is also called the Tactical-Robotic Exterminator. In June 2018, the Army ordered 144 converted Stryker SHORAD vehicles to be delivered by 2022; the configuration with a modified Avenger turret was not chosen.

* – More than 400 Strykers, including 20 M1132 engineer squad vehicles were delivered from March 2023 onwards.

===Future operators===
* The US M1296 Stryker Dragoon is a very strong contender for Bulgaria&#x27;s New IFV Program to replace the BMP-1 in the Bulgarian Land Forces. The U.S. State Department approved of a potential sale of 183 Stryker IFVs for US$1.5 billion. On 9 November 2023, the Bulgarian National Assembly approved the purchase of 183 Strykers and 15 HEMTT trucks.

=== Potential operators ===
* : The US offered to sell 27 Strykers to the Argentine Army.
* : The Stryker is one of the options considered by the Chilean army to replace the Mowag Piranha I.
* : The US has reportedly proposed a plan for joint production of their Stryker ICV with India and talks are underway for formulating a deal. Trials are planned for the Stryker in various Indian terrains. India plans to buy 530 units for 10 standard wheeled mechanised infantry battalions. The offer will evaluated after a thorough analysis of the platform&#x27;s performance in India. If the deal proceeds, first of the units will be directly imported while the rest will be co-produced in India and several changes will be also made in the platform to make it compatible in high-altitude terrain. As of October 2024, the discussions about the procurement has been paused. On 10 January 2025, proposals to establish manufacturing for the Stryker in India were approved by the US government.

=== Failed bids ===
* – Canada originally ordered 66 Stryker Mobile Gun System vehicles in 2003, which were expected to arrive in 2010. In 2006, the Canadian Forces asked its government to cancel the MGS acquisition. The MGS was originally intended to be used in the &quot;Direct Fire Unit&quot;, which will include Tow Under Armour (LAV III) and MMEV (ADATS on LAV III). The MGS was to provide the direct gun fire capabilities of the retiring Leopard C2 tank. With the recent demonstrated usefulness of tanks in Iraq and hurried deployment of Canadian Leopard C2 tanks to Afghanistan, Canada announced the purchase of surplus Leopard 2s from the Netherlands. The MMEV project has since been canceled, and the TUA requirement cut in half.
* – The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had received three Stryker variants for trials, the first of which were vehicles from early production and did not include add-on armor. A 2004 article in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; cited an unnamed military source who said the deal was &quot;buried for good&quot;, and speculated that the Stryker was not chosen due to a number of shortcomings. In 2008, the IDF began receiving the locally designed and produced Namer heavy armored personnel carriers instead.
* – In 2015, the Lithuanian State Defence Council chose the German made Boxer IFV over the US-made Stryker. Lithuania&#x27;s requirement that the first batch be delivered in 2017, and the lack of testing of Stryker&#x27;s 30 mm cannon were reasons.

<text>Upper Canada College (UCC) is an independent day and boarding school for boys in Toronto, Ontario, operating under the International Baccalaureate program. The college is widely described as Canada&#x27;s most prestigious preparatory school, and has produced many notable graduates. With around 1,200 students, UCC is highly selective. The school has a financial aid program which currently awards more than $5 million annually to Canadian citizens.

The secondary school segment is divided into 10 houses; eight are for day students and the remaining two are for boarding students. Aside from the main structure, with its dominant clock tower, the Toronto campus has a number of sports facilities, staff and faculty residences, and other buildings. UCC also owns and operates an outdoor education campus in Norval, Ontario.

UCC was founded in 1829 by Sir John Colborne, then Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, and modelled on Elizabeth College, Guernsey. After facing closure by the government on more than one occasion, UCC became fully independent in 1900, nine years after moving to its present location. It is the oldest independent school in the province of Ontario and the third oldest in Canada. UCC maintains links with the Canadian royal family through its members or representatives of the monarch, sometimes serving as the college&#x27;s Visitor and/or on its Board of Governors.

==History==
===Beginnings and growth===
UCC was founded in 1829 by Major-General Sir John Colborne (later the 1st Baron Seaton), then Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, in the hopes that it would serve as a feeder school to the newly established King&#x27;s College (now known as the University of Toronto). UCC was modelled on the public schools of Great Britain, such as Eton College. Though now an independent school, the college was created with public funds, including an initial land grant of 6,000 acres of crown lands, later increased to 66,000 acres.

The school began teaching in the original Royal Grammar School. However, within a year, it was established on its own campus, known as Russell Square, at the north-west corner of King and Simcoe streets. Colborne brought educated men from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Cambridge and Oxford Universities, attracting them with high salaries. Still, despite ever increasing enrolment, popularity with leading families of the day (both from the local Family Compact and from abroad); a visit in 1847 from the Governor General of the Province of Canada, the Earl of Elgin; and praise from many, including Charles Dickens, UCC was faced with closure on a number of occasions. Opponents of elitism sought to curtail provincial government funding and remove the college from its premises.

The school merged with King&#x27;s College for a period after 1831 and moved 60 years later to its present location in Deer Park, then a rural area. The school expanded in 1902 to take in lower-year students with the construction of a separate primary school building, the Prep, allowing for boys to be enrolled from Grade Three through to graduation.

In 1900, the government of Ontario stopped funding UCC, making it a completely independent school. By 1910, however, UCC was facing declining enrolment and capital; it considered selling the Deer Park campus and moving again to become a full boarding school on a property purchased in Norval, Ontario. Plans were halted by the outbreak of the First World War, and the college remained where it was. It eventually thrived there, both physically and culturally, as the buildings were expanded and bright instructors attracted.

Principal William Grant spearheaded further development. Shortly after assuming his position in 1917, he oversaw recruitment of teachers described as &quot;eccentric, crotchety, quaint, though widely travelled and highly intelligent.&quot; His tenure also saw other improvements. Student enrolment doubled, and bursaries increased. Teacher salaries also doubled, and their benefits now included a pension plan.

UCC maintained a Cadet Corps from around 1837, which became a rifle company attached to the Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada (later The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada) in 1860. It was one of only two student corps called to duty in Canadian military history when it assisted in staving off the Fenian Raids in 1866. Historian Jack Granatstein, in his book &quot;The Generals&quot;, demonstrated that UCC graduates accounted for more than 30 per cent of Canadian generals during the Second World War, and 26 Old Boys achieved brigadier rank or higher. A war memorial display case and plaque in the Upper School&#x27;s main entrance hall is dedicated to the UCC Old Boys who distinguished themselves during Canadian military service periods.

===After the Second World War===
In 1958, UCC faced a major crisis when it was discovered that the Upper School&#x27;s main building was in danger of collapse due to poor construction. At the time, despite its benefactors, UCC had no endowment. An emergency building fund was started and, with the assistance of Prince Philip, all of the necessary $3,200,000 was raised. Ted Rogers and his family paid for the clock tower, while Robert Laidlaw donated the funds necessary to build Laidlaw Hall. Construction of the present main building began in early 1959, and it was opened by former governor general Vincent Massey near the end of 1960.

The crisis forced the school government to rethink their stance on foresight and planning, leading to a years-long program of new construction, salary improvements, and funding sources. Furthermore, in conjunction with Principal Sowby, whom he had helped select, Massey had additional influence on the college and brought about somewhat of a renaissance at the school – a number of distinguished visitors were brought in, and leading minds were hired as masters. At this time, the curriculum began to shift from offering a classical education to offering one grounded in the liberal arts; language options besides Latin were first offered after 1950.

The period from 1965 to 1975 was a decade of constant change at UCC; global and local cultural influences (including the Vietnam War, the bohemian Yorkville neighbourhood, the Woodstock festival, changing fashion trends, rock music, and the Watergate scandal) collided head-on with the conservative and traditional culture and environment at UCC. Individual freedoms trumped institutional discipline, and moral authority had lost its clout. Patrick T. Johnson, principal from 1965 to 1974, managed the cultural transition during these years, successfully integrating societal trends, traditional values, and individual self-expression. One of the casualties, though, was the cadet corps; it was disbanded in September 1975 in favour of a smaller volunteer corps. Under principals educated at Oxford (Johnson) and Cambridge (Sadlier), the college refused to adopt the new provincial educational standards issued in 1967, which it considered lower than the old standards. UCC also moved forward with new educational and athletic facilities across the campus, while opening the campus to the wider community at the same time. By the 1990s, summer camps were set up on the campus for any child who wished to enroll.

The college embarked on another building campaign, again with the aid of Prince Philip, beginning in 1989 and ending in 1994, with the construction of new athletic facilities at the Upper School and the replacement of the 1901 Peacock Building at the Prep. Two years later, UCC adopted the International Baccalaureate (IB), which augmented the Ontario Secondary School Diploma. Following this, Grade Two was added in 1998 and Grade One the next year. Since 2003, UCC has offered places from Senior Kindergarten to Grade Twelve.

===Into the 21st century===
In the years following 1998, five UCC staff were accused of sexual abuse or of possessing child pornography; three were convicted of some of the charges. In 2003, 18 students launched a $62 million class-action lawsuit against UCC, claiming sexual abuse by Doug Brown, who taught at the Prep from 1975 to 1993 and was eventually found guilty in 2004 of nine counts of indecent assault. UCC agreed to a confidential settlement with the victims.

UCC followed the trends in environmentalism when the Board of Governors unanimously voted in 2002 to establish the Green School initiative, wherein environmental education would become &quot;one of the four hallmarks of a UCC education.&quot; Plans to carry this out saw not only upgrades of the school&#x27;s physical plant to meet environmentally sustainable standards, but also an integration of these new initiatives into the curriculum. After the appointment in 2004 of Jim Power as principal, the curriculum further evolved to address reports of wider, societal trends showing a rise in boys&#x27; behavioural problems and a decline in their educational performance. Simultaneously, UCC&#x27;s status as an all-boys school found support following years of pressure to become co-educational, especially as other prominent, formerly all-boys schools in Ontario began to make the switch, such as Lakefield College School (1989), Appleby College (1991), and Trinity College School (1991).

As part of the strategic plan for the school, the board of governors decided in 2007 to close the 180-year-old boarding programme, citing market changes and the neglect of boarding over preceding decades. However, students, the Old Boy community, and others associated with UCC reacted negatively to the announcement, leading the board to revisit its conclusion. It was subsequently decided that boarding should be retained, but only if, among other requirements, it housed no less than 60 students, the facilities were improved (work that took place through the summers of 2013 and 2014), and boarders be drawn from across the country.

==Campus and facilities==
===Toronto campus===

Upper Canada College occupies an open, 17 hectare (43 acre) campus in Deer Park, near the major intersection of Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue, in the residential neighbourhood of Forest Hill. There are 15 buildings on the site:

The main structure (the Upper School), constructed between 1959 and 1960, central on the campus, and with a dominant clock tower, houses the secondary school component of the college, in a quadrangle form. Laidlaw Hall, the principal assembly hall, featuring a full theatre stage and a pipe organ, is attached to the west end of the Upper School and, at the other end, is the Memorial Wing, the school&#x27;s main infirmary. Closing the north end of the main quadrangle (which is the location of the statue of the Lord Seaton, installed in 1934) is one building, built in 1932, that contains the two boarding houses, as well as two private residences for the associated boarding masters, adjacent to which is the school chapel, donated by Governor General Vincent Massey.
Satellite to this complex are townhouse-style residences for masters and their families; the residence of the college&#x27;s principal, Grant House, built in 1917; and a small, two-storey cricket pavilion, inaugurated by Governor General Ramon Hnatyshyn. The Preparatory School, part of which was designed by Eden Smith, is at the south-west corner of the campus, near which is a home for the Prep headmaster and a small gatehouse.

The athletic facilities include an indoor pool and three gymnasiums, as well as, around the campus, the William P. Wilder sports complex (containing an NHL and an Olympic sized hockey rink, one of only four in Ontario), a sports activity bubble, tennis courts, a sports court, a running track, and nine regulation sized sports fields. The two major fields of the Upper School are called &quot;Commons&quot; and &quot;Lords&quot;, after, respectively, the British House of Commons and House of Lords, and one of the main central fields is known as &quot;the Oval&quot; (covered in winter by a bubble). In the summer of 2006, the latter, along with the encompassing running track, was renovated, with the grass replaced by a partially synthetic astroturf/grass hybrid and the track paved with a rubber turf. Several metres below the field, geothermal pipes were laid to provide alternative energy heating for both the Upper School and the adjacent sports complex. A number of these facilities are the result of a decade long, $90 million capital building campaign launched in the 1990s. Still planned are an Olympic-standard, 50-metre swimming pool; a new racquet centre for squash, badminton, and tennis; a rowing centre; the expansion of both the Prep and Upper School academic buildings; and an expansion of the archives.

The Ontario Heritage Trust, a non-profit agency of the Ontario Ministry of Culture, erected three plaques outlining UCC&#x27;s presence and history in Toronto. One is on the north-east corner of 20 Duncan Street (the only existing building from the college&#x27;s original campus), the second at the south-east corner of 212 King Street West, and one at the main entrance of the current campus at 200 Lonsdale Road. (An additional plaque that mentions Upper Canada College stands in Clarence Square, commemorating Alexander Dunn, an Old Boy who received Canada&#x27;s first Victoria Cross.)

===Norval campus===
Upper Canada College owns and maintains an outdoor educational facility near the town of Norval, Ontario, on of property on the Credit River. The land was used by First Nations as camping and hunting grounds and Huron and Iroquois travelled along the Credit to Lake Ontario to trade with Europeans. By the early 19th century, the land supported farming; many remnants of this use remain, including apple orchards and artifacts, some of which were unearthed by students during simulated archaeological digs.
Norval&#x27;s main purpose is to teach college students about the natural environment, sustainability, and ecosystems through outdoor learning programs, some in conjunction with Outward Bound Canada. It is staffed by five full-time teachers, a superintendent, and cooks and housekeepers. Throughout the school year, entire classes, houses, or portions of certain grades will have a several day stay at Norval and other Ontario schools use the property and its facilities during the weeks when UCC students are not in residence. Norval also hosts an open house each season, with the spring Maple Madness focusing on the site&#x27;s traditional maple syrup manufacturing, as well as cross-country skiing in winter and pumpkin carving in the autumn.

The land was purchased in 1913, at a time when the city of Toronto was quickly growing around the college&#x27;s Deer Park campus and the trustees were considering moving the school to a new location. Plans for buildings were drawn up by an architectural firm. However, due to the outbreak of the First World War and then the depression, the move was fully abandoned in the 1930s. The college first attempted to sell the land in 1928 and again in 1935, but found no buyers. Eventually, the property was developed into an outdoor education centre for UCC students and community. Beginning in 1913, an annual picnic was held at Norval, the first being catered by the King Edward Hotel. As the land had originally been cleared for agricultural use, much of the site was open field until over 700,000 seedlings were planted by staff and students through the 1940s, followed by the creation of an arboretum in 1962. The first bunk house was built in the 1930s and augmented in 1967 by another, larger residence and dining building known as Stephen House, which won a Massey Medal for excellence in architecture for the designer, Blake Millar. Stephen House contains a classroom and laboratory, in addition to the residential spaces for students and staff. There is also a bungalow-style residence for the property caretaker and in 2003 several log cabins were built for writing retreats.

Into the 2000s, the school came under criticism for keeping the entirety of the increasingly taxed Norval property while so little of it was actually used; this argument has gained increased credence in light of the consistent yearly tuition hikes and mounting legal costs. Despite repeated assertions that the college had no intention of selling the property, citing not only rapidly increasing land value, but also an intention to hold it to prevent industrial development on land that contains a variety of wildlife, including spotted deer and hares, UCC sold a small portion of the acreage in 2007 to help cover costs related to the 2003 class action lawsuit brought against the school by former students. In 2011, the Norval Long-Range Planning Committee recommended that Norval&#x27;s facilities should be expanded to allow for more overnight students and co-educational use.

===Waterfront facility===

Upper Canada College has a waterfront site that is located beside Lake Ontario at Toronto&#x27;s Outer Harbour Marina. Occupied by the Don Lindsay Boathouse, the site primarily serves UCC&#x27;s rowing team, which trains out of the facility during the spring and fall seasons. When not in use by the school&#x27;s rowing program, the facility becomes a community rowing centre, hosting UCC&#x27;s summer camps and Horizon program.

==Tuition, scholarships, and assets==

Upper Canada College is Canada&#x27;s wealthiest independent school, having an endowment of more than CA$100 million. For the 2020–2021 school year, tuition fees range from $34,135 to $37,135 (not including a $8,500 initial registration fee, books and uniform) for day students and $61,085 to $66,835 for boarders (not including a $5,000 initial registration fee). An additional $500 technology fee is levied on all students in the Upper School, which covers the costs of a MacBook Air laptop computer, the associated software, and technological support. According to the school, fewer than two per cent of the Canadian population can afford the full cost of attending the school. The institution has strict admissions standards, accepting approximately 20 per cent of all applicants for the 2018–2019 school year. The college began a fundraising campaign in 2012 to obtain $100 million for scholarships; a donation of $11 million was received from Stu Lang, the largest single gift in Canadian independent school history. To honour Lang&#x27;s donation, UCC created the scholars Lang Scholar Program to recognize up to 15 student-athletes annually with extraordinary leadership potential. UCC disbursed over $5.0 million in financial aid in 2019 to approximately 20 per cent of students. Only students in grade five and above are eligible for this assistance.

Besides its own archives containing records that outline the history of Upper Canada, the province of Ontario, and the city of Toronto dating back to the mid-19th century, the college also has a notable collection of artwork, antiques, and war medals. This includes the Order of Canada insignia presented to Robertson Davies, Foster Hewitt, Charles Band, and Arnold Smith, plus Canada&#x27;s first Victoria Cross, awarded in 1854 to Old Boy Alexander Roberts Dunn, and the Victoria Cross given, and ceremonial sword belonging, to Hampden Zane Churchill Cockburn; the valour medals were given to the Canadian War Museum on permanent loan on 17 May 2006. In the college&#x27;s chapel, itself decorated with works by Canadian artists, is an altar made of marble from parts of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, in London, England, that were damaged in the Blitz and donated by Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s Walter Robert Matthews. On this is an altar cloth made from a piece of that which was used for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Held is an American flag that flew atop one of the World Trade Center towers in New York City. Further, the school holds works by Thoreau MacDonald and a collection of original paintings from the Group of Seven (though several were auctioned by the college in an effort to pay for the lawsuits it faced in 2004); an original Stephen Leacock essay, titled &quot;Why Boys Leave Home—A Talk on Camping&quot;, donated in 2005 and published for the first time in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;; and the original manuscript of Robertson Davies&#x27; work &quot;The Mask of Aesop&quot;, which he wrote in 1952 specifically for the Prep&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Also in UCC&#x27;s possession is a chair owned by Sir John A. Macdonald and another that once belonged to George Airey Kirkpatrick.

==Governance, faculty, and staff==
Upper Canada College is incorporated under an act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and administered by a 17-member Board of Governors as a public trust, with the current chair of the board being Russ Higgins, a principal of MacPherson Builders ltd. Somerset Entertainment. The board, whose members are appointed and elected from alumni, parents of students past and present, and the wider UCC community, selects the college&#x27;s principal, who serves for five years, managing the school&#x27;s annual operation and heading an executive committee composed of vice-principals, department heads, and administration staff. There are also a number of other committees for advancement, finance and audit, governance and nominating, human resources, long range planning, property, and senior management review. Additionally, the UCC Foundation, a registered charity in Ontario since 1962 and run by a board of trustees, manages the school&#x27;s endowment. Honorary trustees include David R. Beatty, John Craig Eaton II, Hans Michael Jebsen, Michael MacMillan, Kelly and Michael Meighen, Richard M. Thomson, Galen Weston, and Michael Wilson.

There are 129 faculty members in total, of whom 12 possess doctorates, 40 hold master&#x27;s degrees, and 20 per cent are International Baccalaureate examiners. 17 faculty members reside on the campus. The student-to-teacher ratio is 18:1 in the lower grades and 19:1 in the upper grades.

===Visitor===
The visitor of Upper Canada College is a ceremonial role within UCC&#x27;s governmental structure, though the occupant has the right or responsibility of inspecting and reporting on the College.

Sir John Colborne served informally as UCC&#x27;s first visitor. When the post was created in 1833, the Bishop of York was named as the occupant, &quot;ex officio&quot;. Four years later, an act of the Upper Canada legislature outlined that the visitors of UCC would be the judges of His Majesty&#x27;s Court of King&#x27;s Bench. The role was then transferred in 1850 to the governor general of the Province of Canada, on behalf of Queen Victoria, until Confederation, after which the lieutenant governor of Ontario acted as visitor. However, it was later felt the provincial viceroy was associated too much to politics and the office of visitor was not mentioned in the 1901 act that altered the government of UCC.

Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII and then Duke of Windsor), was in 1920 appointed as Upper Canada College&#x27;s official visitor, at the Prince&#x27;s request. The &quot;College Times&quot; wrote then:

It will be a great pleasure to all to hear that the HRH the Prince of Wales has expressed a wish to be given the fine old English title of visitor of this school. HRH met so many &#x27;Old Boys&#x27; while [fighting in the First World War] that, when he made his visit to Canada last year, he instituted special inquiries about the previous history of the College. Finding that the title existed, he has thus honored us by becoming &#x27;Visitor of Upper Canada College&#x27; [...] The gracious offer of the Prince places the position on a still higher plane and it makes us all feel a lot prouder of the grand old College to which we belong.

Edward was removed from the post of visitor when he abdicated the Canadian throne in 1936. The office thereafter lay dormant until 1955. Maintaining a connection with the Canadian royal family, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (husband of Edward VIII&#x27;s niece, Queen Elizabeth II), was appointed as visitor of UCC, a role in which he served until his death in 2021, making him the longest-acting visitor in the College&#x27;s history. He visited the college five times (in 1959, 1969, 1979, 1989, and 1993), aided two fundraising campaigns, and gave items to the school, including a signed cricket bat.

During his 1959 visit to the school, Philip was made an honorary Old Boy and unveiled the permanent display of his personal coat of arms in the Massey Quadrangle. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the College&#x27;s founding, the Prince made a two-day visit to UCC, which included a reception and formal banquet Exhibition Place and distributing prizes to the winners of the first annual Jubilee Association Run. Historian Richard Howard said of Philip in 1979, &quot;In the lengthy history of the College, no visitor since our inception has taken such a deep interest in our affairs, for such an extended period, as has the present distinguished incumbent.”

In May 2012, the Upper Canada College Monarchist League conducted a poll and submitted to the Board of Governors a report outlining how 71 per cent of students surveyed (91 per cent of those in Year One) approved of another member of the royal family serving as UCC&#x27;s visitor upon the resignation or demise of the Duke of Edinburgh. It was recommended that the next person to occupy the post be non-partisan and of a young age, so as to be likely to serve for a number of decades, as the Duke of Edinburgh had done. The most widely supported figure was Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (now the Prince of Wales).

==Student body==
UCC is a non-denominational school with approximately 1,000-day students and 88 boarders; Senior Kindergarten to Grade Seven students, approximately 400 boys, attend the Preparatory School (the Prep), after which a boy may move on to the Upper School, which consists of Grades Eight to Twelve. The Upper School years are known as follows:

* Grade Eight: Year Eight (formerly called Year One)
* Grade Nine: Year Nine (formerly called Year Two)
* Grade Ten: Year Ten (formerly called Foundation Year)
* Grade Eleven: Year Eleven (formerly called IB1)
* Grade Twelve: Year Twelve (formerly called IB2)
While Prep students are divided into forms, UCC, like several other schools in the Commonwealth of Nations, divides its Upper School students into houses. The house system was first adopted in 1923, consisting of only four houses until the late 1930s, after which the number increased the present ten. Eight of these—Bremner&#x27;s, Howard&#x27;s, Jackson&#x27;s, Martland&#x27;s, McHugh&#x27;s, Mowbray&#x27;s, Orr&#x27;s, and Scadding&#x27;s—are for day students and the remaining two—Seaton&#x27;s and Wedd&#x27;s—are for boarders. The houses compete in an annual intramural competition for the Prefects&#x27; Cup and the boarders also take part in weekend events and trips with boarders from neighbouring girls&#x27; schools.

Martland&#x27;s was named for John &quot;Gentle&quot; Martland, a master at the College who was most well known for his reform of the boarding houses, making them into something more than simple residences. He toned down the rigid study regimes, cold dormitories, bland menus, and bullying, fostering instead more tolerating discipline, swift punishment for serious offenders, the occasional feast, and organised recreation. Wedd&#x27;s is the one the oldest of the ten houses at UCC and is named for William Wedd, formerly first classical master.

The school&#x27;s student government, created in 1892 and known as the Board of Stewards, represents the students at events, such as Association Day and Winterfest, and relays their wishes, during times of change or concern, to the upper administration. The group comprises 17 elected members of the Leaving Class: one steward for each house (the heads of houses) plus seven—the Head Steward and six stewards with portfolio—chosen by the majority of the whole student body. In addition to the stewards, students can enter the prefects program, requiring them to show leadership through their senior years to be awarded the title of &quot;Prefect&quot; upon graduation, the highest recognition UCC offers &quot;for citizenship and leadership.&quot;
Though Upper Canada College has accepted ethnic minorities since the first black student (Peter Gallego, the son of a former American slave) enrolled in 1831 and First Nations boys, such as Francis Assikinack (son of the Ojibwe leader Jean-Baptiste Assiginack) in 1840, their representation within the student body was initially disproportionate to the same within the city&#x27;s population and the school developed a reputation as a &quot;WASP bastion&quot;. Michael Ignatieff considered the school&#x27;s ethnic makeup during his time there, between 1959 and 1965, reflective of the culture of Toronto in general; according to him, &quot;basically Tory, Anglican and fantastically patrician.&quot; Peter C. Newman, who attended UCC a decade before Ignatieff, and himself Jewish, said antisemitism was &quot;virtually non-existent.&quot; According to school historian Richard Howard, UCC transformed its culture during the 1970s, as it began to offer assistance to the less affluent and made attempts to attract boys from visible minorities, becoming what he called &quot;a small United Nations&quot; that echoed Toronto&#x27;s emerging ethnic variety (today, students from over 20 different countries and regions attend UCC), though, as recently as 1990, there were references in &quot;College Times&quot; editorials to antisemitism and sexism. These aspects of college life came to light in 1994, through James T. Fitzgerald&#x27;s book &quot;Old Boys&quot;, which published some alumni&#x27;s recollections of the school. In it, Peter Dalglish noted that while the student body was more racially diverse, it was still predominantly populated by the upper middle class, with the Asian students being even wealthier than their white counterparts. The college took the criticisms seriously, hiring Dalglish to help open UCC to the broader community. The decision to reverse the 2007 plan to eliminate boarding was made in part because of boarding&#x27;s inherent ability to allow students from around the world to attend UCC. The college&#x27;s expansion of financial aid beginning in 2012 was intended to socioeconomically diversify the student body.

==Curriculum==
Upper Canada College educates boys from Senior Kindergarten through to Grade Twelve. Graduates receive both the Ontario Secondary School Diploma and the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma; UCC adopted the IB program in 1996 and the entire curriculum is today guided by the non-governmental organization. French, language, mathematics, science, outdoor education, physical education, the arts, and more are covered during a boy&#x27;s years in the Prep School and, once boys move to the Upper School in Year One (Grade Eight), they begin university preparation through a liberal arts program. The courseload includes mathematics, history, geography, science, English, second languages, civics, design, film and the dramatic, visual, and musical arts, as well as computer science. Aiding both student and teachers is the Wernham West Centre for Learning, the most comprehensive and endowed secondary school learning facility in Canada. Created in 2002 as a department pertaining to the refinement of academic skills and assisting the students with learning disabilities, its primary focus is to facilitate improved learning skills and abilities, as well as accommodate for students with particular learning disabilities.

==Extracurricular activities==
Participation in extracurricular activities is encouraged at Upper Canada College; all students are required to complete 40 hours of Community Service as a part of their Ontario Secondary School Diploma as well as complete 150 hours of other extracurricular commitments, with an equal division between arts, athletics, and community service (what the IB calls &quot;CAS&quot;: creativity, action, service), prior to graduation.

===Arts and athletics===
Upper Canada College runs a variety of extracurricular theatre programs, ranging in scope and scale, from musicals to Shakespeare, with at least one large-scale and one small-scale production each year. Smaller, student written and run plays are also produced. The theatre program, which includes all aspects of production, is run in conjunction with Bishop Strachan School, a nearby girls&#x27; private school. Various bands and music groups that practice extra-curricularly are also supported by the college, including a wind ensemble, concert band, stage band, string ensemble, jazz ensemble, and singers. These groups compete in festivals at different levels and also organize fundraising concerts. UCC has sports rivalries with other boys&#x27; schools in Ontario.
Sports teams run by UCC include alpine ski, baseball, basketball, cricket, football, golf, hockey, rowing, rugby, lacrosse, soccer, squash, Swimming, Track and Field, tennis, and volleyball. Some teams are purely intramural, but 45 interscholastic teams compete in the CISAA and OFSAA and regularly place high in the standings at national and international competitions, such as the Head of the Charles Regatta.

===Programs===
The World Affairs Conference is Canada&#x27;s oldest student run conference, begun in 1983 and organized in conjunction with Branksome Hall since the late 1980s. Held annually, the Conference has reached over 4,000 students, 25 countries, and 65 schools around the world. Past speakers have included Mehdi Hasan, Ralph Nader, Stephen Lewis, Michael Ignatieff, Susan Faludi, Gwynne Dyer, Thomas Homer-Dixon, Geoffrey Hinton, Roberta Bondar, Masai Ujiri, Francisco Salgasti, Esko Aho, Edward Snowden, and Martin Luther King III, all of whom have spoken on a variety of topics including human rights, gender issues, justice, globalization, and health ethics. The conference has also received letters of support from both the Mayor of Toronto and the Prime Minister of Canada. The Executives of WAC for the 2023-2024 school year are: Ray Wu (Conference Chair), Shaya Farahmand (Conference Chair), Alex Woolsey (Assistant Chair), Darwin Li (Director of Communications), Devlin Moniz (Director of Plenaries), Eugenio Gigi Ciarlandini (Director of Keynotes), Adrian Mak (Director of Marketing), Aarav Dogra (Director of Finance), Samuel Martineau (Director of Technology), Alex Woolsey (Director of Programs), Caleb Chong (Director of Registration), Emerson McQueen (Director of Volunteering), and Jai Sandhu (Director of Facilities).

In conjunction with other schools, UCC ran the Ontario Model Parliament (OMP), a simulation of a provincial parliament that started in 1986, when it was founded by UCC teacher Paul Bennett, and was composed of two events: an Elections Day at UCC, followed by a three-day simulation that took place in the legislative chamber at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. UCC students made up the entirety of the Executive Committee that organizes and runs the model parliament, however 200 students from high schools around the province participated. Past Elections Day speakers have included Art Eggleton, John Tory, John Aimers, Bob Rae, and Rex Murphy. As of 2015, OMP has been replaced by OMUN, a Model UN conference now led by UCC students sometimes in conjunction with the Bishop Strachan School and Branksome Hall. OMUN hosts around 400–500 delegates annually and has multiple international delegations present. UCC hosts 50–100 clubs (depending on the term), with Model UN and DECA being among the most popular.

The UCC Green School is an environmental organization composed of student, teachers, and faculty, through which UCC has planted and maintained an educational organic garden, reduced landfill waste and water consumption, and implemented a program of purchasing renewable resources for renovations. The Green School has won awards from the City of Toronto and the National Audubon Society.

===Media===
The College maintains and administers its own publishing company, the UCC Press, which produces all school publications. It also once printed professional texts, novels, and histories, such as those by Robert Lowell, but the UCC Press today prints the majority of school-related publications—newspaper, alumni magazines, financial reports, etc.—save for the &quot;College Times&quot;. UCC provides several publications, most of which are written, directed, and printed by students.

The &quot;College Times&quot; is UCC&#x27;s yearbook and is the oldest school publication in Canada, having been issued without fail since it was founded by John Ross Robertson, then a student at UCC, in September 1857. The first editions were written by Robertson and fellow pupils and printed on presses at &quot;The Globe&quot;, the predecessor newspaper of the present &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. Past editors include Robertson Davies, Michael Ignatieff, and Stephen Leacock. Issued more regularly, Upper Canada College also has an online publication, The Blue and White (TBAW, tbaw.ca) to which students submit articles about school life and current affairs. TBAW was founded in 2011 by William Hall. &quot;Old Times&quot; is the school&#x27;s alumni magazine, which reports on the lives of Old Boys, and highlights recent and upcoming events.

Serials for the student body include &quot;The Blazer&quot;, the college humour newspaper; &quot;Quiddity&quot;, the school&#x27;s annual arts and literature publication, which showcases students&#x27; creative work; &quot;The Blue Page&quot;, a one-page weekly publication of letters to the editor expressing opinions on any relevant issue; and &quot;Convergence&quot;, the school&#x27;s award-winning student newspaper. In addition, BluesTV was a student-led, school television network that started in 2007 and aired multimedia, slideshows of pictures from various school events, as well as promotional material created for the college. BluesTV became a subsidiary of the Media Association in 2009, fostering the operation of a live-announcement submission and display system.

===Community service===
Upper Canada College encourages students to engage in voluntary community service. In relation to this, the college runs the Horizons program, in which local underprivileged children are tutored in music, digital media, and academics twice a week by current UCC students. Further, each year, usually for two to four weeks during Spring Break, UCC also organises trips for 15 to 20 of its Upper School students to various developing countries where they take part in community building services such as constructing schools, wells and homes, or aiding in conservation work. Students have ventured to places like Venezuela, El Salvador, Kenya, and China.

===Events===
Every year the school plans and runs several on or off-site events, some of which are open only to students in certain years, while others to the entire student population, alumni, and their respective friends and family. These events are intended to serve a variety of purposes—promoting school spirit, for enjoyment, fund raising or philanthropic causes—and many are organized by the Upper Canada College Association, with the help of parent and student volunteers.

Association Day is analogous to UCC&#x27;s homecoming. Held since 1979, &quot;A-Day&quot;, as it is informally known, constitutes the school&#x27;s largest annual event, taking place over the last weekend of September and culminating on the Saturday with a large festival, including competitive matches for all fall sports teams and the Association Dinner for Old Boys celebrating their five-year incremental class reunions. Later in the academic year is the Founder&#x27;s Dinner, a formal event that has been held for more than a century. It typically takes place on the Thursday night before the third weekend in January, which is made a special long weekend for students as a commemoration of Sir John Colborne&#x27;s birthday. Another regular event is the UCC Gala, a black tie dinner and silent auction organized every three or four years in May.

Two secondary school student dances take place in the calendar year: The Battalion Ball originated out of the &quot;At Home&quot;, a UCC community-wide event similar to a modern homecoming and first held in 1887. The revival of the UCC Rifle Corps in 1891 resulted in students attending the At Home in their cadet uniforms and, by 1897, a dance was added to the festivities in the evening, known as the &quot;Rifle Corps Dance&quot;. By 1931, the dance became the &quot;Battalion Ball&quot;, after the Rifle Corps was renamed the UCC Cadet Battalion, and, in 1971, the colloquial nickname &quot;The Batt&quot; was devised, which later developed into &quot;Batt Ball&quot;. The event was held off-campus for the first time in 1975, at the Royal York Hotel, and, after 1976, when the Cadet Corps was disbanded, school uniforms replaced military attire, rock bands played, and Batt Ball became more of a spring prom. Today, Batt Ball is reserved for students in grades 11 and 12, held at venues such as the Royal York Hotel or Arcadian Court, with attire being tuxedo for boys and evening gown or cocktail dress for girls, and music is provided by DJs. The Stewards&#x27; Dance is UCC&#x27;s fall semi-formal and is typically fashioned around costume party themes such as &quot;Great Couples in History&quot;. The dance takes place in late October and is administered by the Board of Stewards for all students in grades 11 and above.

Various sporting events occur annually: Hockey Night has been held by the college since 1933 as an evening where the First Hockey team would play a feature game against one of UCC&#x27;s rival schools in competition for the Foster Hewitt Victory Trophy. The game was held at Maple Leaf Gardens, thanks to the generosity of the arena&#x27;s builder, Conn Smythe, and its (as well as the then Toronto Maple Leafs) owner, Harold Ballard, both themselves Old Boys. After the closing of The Gardens in 2000, the event was moved to the Air Canada Centre and then the Ricoh Coliseum. Over the decades other games were added to the roster, including a game involving the school&#x27;s Junior Varsity team, the final game of the house hockey tournament, and a game between Havergal College and Bishop Strachan School. By the early 1990s, pleasure skating and Prep School games had been added to the evening&#x27;s schedule. Further, the Terry Fox Run is one of Upper Canada College&#x27;s most successful events; the school is an official site for the run, acting as the start and end point, as well as part of the course, which ventures throughout Toronto&#x27;s Belt-Line. UCC&#x27;s Terry Fox Run is also the largest site and has raised the most money in the world since 2000. The Prep Games Day is an annual held event at the junior school.

Bishop Strachan School (BSS) is located only two blocks from UCC, it is UCC&#x27;s sister school. UCC students work on joint projects with students of other nearby girls&#x27; schools, including BSS, St. Clement&#x27;s School, Havergal College, and Branksome Hall.

The school had, between 2008 and 2009, a relationship with an Ontario Junior Hockey League team, the Upper Canada Hockey Club, though the team and the school were not directly affiliated. Upper Canada College is also a member of the Ontario Tennis Association.

==People==
===Alumni===
The college states that almost every UCC graduate, known as an &quot;Old Boy&quot;, goes on to post-secondary schooling The graduate community consists of over 6,000 Old Boys around the world and, though the career paths of the college&#x27;s alumni are varied, UCC has a reputation for educating many prominent and notable graduates.

The school has produced 26 Rhodes Scholars and five Loran Scholars. Six graduates became lieutenant governors, four were appointed as premiers, seven as chief justices, and four were elected as Mayor of Toronto. At least 18 Old Boys have been appointed to the Queen&#x27;s/King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and 18 were made Queen&#x27;s/King&#x27;s Counsel. Two were awarded the Victoria Cross, two were appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour and three to the Royal Victorian Order, no less than 50 have been inducted into the Order of Canada since the honour&#x27;s inception in 1967, 11 into the Order of Ontario, and at least 14 have been accepted as fellows of the Royal Society of Canada. Ten are Olympic medallists and eight have played in the National Hockey League.

===UCC Association===
The Upper Canada College Old Boys&#x27; Association is a non-profit organization established in 1891, on the day of the closure of the college&#x27;s Russell Square campus. The name was changed in 1969 to the Upper Canada College Association, when the association expanded its mandate to include parents, faculty, staff and friends of the college in matters relating to UCC, such as governance and advancement. Specific programs are also run by the association, including those that permit recent graduates to volunteer as mentors to students, and Old Boy reunions are set up around the world by the association&#x27;s fifteen branches outside of Toronto: Calgary, Halifax, Kingston, London, Montreal, Ottawa, and Vancouver in Canada; Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco in the United States; London in the United Kingdom; Hong Kong in China; and Budapest in Hungary.

A 29-person board of directors, referred to as the Association Council, meets three times a year to discuss matters facing the college and plan association events; 21 of those on the council are elected by members of the association at its annual meeting, while the remaining eight are ex officio. Four of the 17 members of the college&#x27;s board of governors come from the association board, including the President of the Association, and serve on the larger body for a three-year period.

==Arms, motto, and emblem==

Upper Canada College&#x27;s motto is , which was derived from a poem by John Jortin titled &quot;Ad Ventos—ante A.D. MDCCXXVII&quot; (Latin for &#x27;To the Winds—Before AD 1727&#x27;). The words, attached to the arms of Lord Nelson in 1797, were first used in relation to UCC in 1833, as part of an emblem stamped on the inside of books given as prizes, showing the phrase written on a ribbon tying together two laurel leaves around the school&#x27;s name. Around 1850, a crown replaced the school&#x27;s name; John Ross Robertson stated this was at the insistence of Henry Scadding, who argued in favour of its use because the school had both been founded by a lieutenant governor and was at first a royal grammar school. The crown originally used was that of King George IV.

In 1889, Scadding produced the design for an emblem which can still be seen over the doors to Laidlaw Hall at the college&#x27;s Upper School. L.C. Kerslake described this emblem in 1956:

The small wreath, crossed anchor and sword in the centre of the crest are found in Lord Nelson&#x27;s coat of arms.
The open book in the upper left corner is symbolic of education which is the primary function of any school. The quadrant-shaped figure in the upper right corner is a section of the standard of St. George and signifies the school&#x27;s connection with England and Great Britain, the native land of the founder, Lord Seaton.
Technically speaking, the crown should not be included in the crest, as the school was not instituted by royal charter. However, loyalty to the Crown is one of the fundamental traditions of UCC and is certain to endure as long as the school itself.
The cornua copiae just above the motto stands for the fullness of school life which is one of the distinctive marks of UCC.

This complex design, known as &quot;Scadding&#x27;s Device&quot;, which was just the Seal of Upper Canada as authorised in 1820 with the college&#x27;s motto and palm branches applied, was never widely used. Instead, the simple crown between laurel leaves tied with a ribbon bearing the school&#x27;s motto became the standard emblem, although its appearance changed over time in reflection of current tastes.

It was not until the mid-1970s, as the college approached its sesquicentennial, that consideration was given to having the emblem authorised by the College of Arms (Canada&#x27;s heraldic authority at that time). The Armorial Bearings Committee was established to oversee the project, and a petition was submitted to the Earl Marshal in 1981. The Board of Governors insisted that the school&#x27;s traditional emblem be incorporated into the forthcoming achievement; however, as the emblem includes a royal crown, it was necessary to obtain the Canadian monarch&#x27;s personal permission to use it officially. This was done via the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, then John Black Aird (himself a UCC Old Boy), and Queen Elizabeth II consented to the request, making UCC the only institution of its kind in the Commonwealth of Nations to have the royal crown in its arms.
The letters patent granting UCC its armorial devices, including a heraldic standard, were issued on 4 January 1985, the 155th anniversary of the college&#x27;s first day of classes. The traditional emblem became the school&#x27;s official badge. However, as text and numbers are normally not included in such badges, the motto was omitted, but the King of Arms made an exception to the rules by allowing the retention of the date &quot;1829&quot;. The emblem also became the crest of the school&#x27;s new arms, although without the number &quot;1829&quot;, since heraldic rules dictate that the royal crown must sit directly on the helmet.

The escutcheon of the arms shows two deer&#x27;s heads in the chief (one being the crest of the arms of the founder, Lord Seaton, and the other taken from the arms of Bishop John Strachan, the first chairman of the board of governors) while, below a line of division embattled as in Lord Seaton&#x27;s arms, is the aforementioned Scadding&#x27;s Device surmounted by another royal crown. The shield is supported by a master in academic gown (on the left) and a student in cricket uniform (on the right), both styled as figures from the mid-19th century. These armorial devices were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority in 2005.

==In media==
In the 2006 film &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot;, the main character of Martin Ward (Colm Feore) is a graduate of Upper Canada College. The school is also mentioned in Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot; as an institution into which the wealthy in Rosedale, Toronto, wished to enroll their eldest sons.

UCC was a filming location for the 1993 movie &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; and was the focus of episode eight of season nine of the Rogers Television show &quot;Structures&quot;.

<text>The Ouachita Mountains (), simply referred to as the Ouachitas, are a mountain range in western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma. They are formed by a thick succession of highly deformed Paleozoic strata constituting the Ouachita Fold and Thrust Belt, one of the important orogenic belts of North America. The Ouachitas continue in the subsurface to the northeast, where they make a poorly understood connection with the Appalachians and to the southwest, where they join with the Marathon uplift area of West Texas. Together with the Ozark Plateaus, the Ouachitas form the U.S. Interior Highlands. The highest natural point is Mount Magazine at .

The Ouachita Mountains is a Level III ecoregion designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The region has been subdivided into six Level IV ecoregions.

==Etymology==
Louis R. Harlan claimed that &quot;Ouachita&quot; is composed of the Choctaw words &quot;ouac&quot; for &quot;bison&quot; and &quot;chito&quot; for &quot;large&quot;, together meaning &quot;country of large bison&quot;. At one time, herds of bison inhabited the lowland areas of the Ouachitas. Historian Muriel H. Wright wrote that &quot;Ouachita&quot; is composed of the Choctaw words &quot;owa&quot; for &quot;hunt&quot; and &quot;chito&quot; for &quot;big&quot;, together meaning &quot;big hunt far from home&quot;. According to the article &quot;Ouachita&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture&quot;, &quot;Ouachita&quot; comes from the French spelling of the Caddo word &quot;washita&quot;, meaning &quot;good hunting grounds&quot;.

==Geography==

The Ouachitas are a major physiographic province of Arkansas and Oklahoma and are generally grouped with the Arkansas River Valley. Together with the Ozark Plateaus, the Ouachitas form the U.S. Interior Highlands, one of few mountainous regions between the Appalachians and Rockies.

===Flora===
The Ouachitas are dominated by pine, oak, and hickory. The shortleaf pine (&quot;Pinus echinata&quot;) and post oak (&quot;Quercus stellata&quot;) thrive in dry, nutrient-poor soil and are common in upland areas. The maple-leaf oak (&quot;Quercus acerifolia&quot;) is found at only four sites worldwide, all of which are in the Ouachitas. Some native tree species, such as the eastern red-cedar (&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;), are colonizers of human-disturbed sites.

The Ouachita National Forest covers approximately 1.8 million acres of the Ouachitas. It is one of the largest and oldest national forests in the Southern U.S., created through an executive order by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 18, 1907. There are six wilderness areas within the Ouachita National Forest, which are protected areas designed to minimize the impacts of human activities.

Several plants are endemic to the Ouachitas, including: &quot;Agalinis nuttallii&quot;, &quot;Cardamine angustata&quot; var. &quot;ouachitana&quot;, &quot;Carex latebracteata&quot;, &quot;Galium arkansanum&quot; var. &quot;pubifolium&quot;, &quot;Houstonia ouachitana&quot;, &quot;Hydrophyllum brownei&quot;, &quot;Liatris compacta&quot;, &quot;Quercus acerifolia&quot;, &quot;Polymnia cossatotensis&quot;, &quot;Solidago ouachitensis&quot;, &quot;Spiranthes niklasii&quot; (near endemic, also found on Crowley&#x27;s Ridge), &quot;Streptanthus maculatus&quot; subsp. &quot;obtusifolius&quot;, &quot;Streptanthus squamiformis&quot;, &quot;Valerianella palmerii&quot;, and &quot;Vernonia lettermanii&quot;.

===Fauna===
Bison and elk once found habitat in the Ouachita Mountains, but have since been extirpated. Today, there are large populations of white-tailed deer, coyote, and other common temperate forest animals. Though elusive, hundreds of black bear roam the Ouachitas. Several cryptic species of salamander are endemic to the Ouachitas and have traits that vary from one locale to another.

===Subranges===
====Athens Plateau====
The Athens Plateau or Athens Piedmont (EPA Level IV ecoregion 36a) consists of a series of low relief ridges, none exceeding . It is located south of the Ouachitas and extends to the Arkansas-Oklahoma border. The Athens Piedmont runs from Arkadelphia, Arkansas into Oklahoma through Clark, Howard, Pike, and Sevier counties in Arkansas and McCurtain County in Oklahoma. The ecoregion&#x27;s low ridges and hills are widely underlain by Mississippian Stanley Shale in contrast to other parts of the Ouachitas. Today, pine plantations are widespread; they are far more extensive than in the more rugged parts of the Arkansas Ouachitas. Pastureland and hayland also occur. Cattle and broiler chickens are important farm products. 
The Caddo, Cossatot, and Missouri mountains are a high, compact group of mountains composed of the weather-resistant Arkansas Novaculite. They are located primarily in Montgomery and Polk counties, Arkansas. The highest natural point is Raspberry Mountain at . The headwaters of multiple rivers are found in this area, including the Caddo, Cossatot, and Little Missouri rivers.

The Cross Mountains are located in Polk and Sevier counties, Arkansas and McCurtain County, Oklahoma. The highest natural point is Whiskey Peak at .

The Crystal Mountains are located primarily in Montgomery County, Arkansas. They are so named because of the occurrence of some of the world&#x27;s finest quartz. The Crystal Mountains are generally taller than the nearby Zig Zag Mountains, achieving elevations over .

====Fourche Mountains====
The Fourche Mountains (EPA Level IV ecoregion 36d) are a long, continuous chain of east-west mountains composed of the weather-resistant Jackfork Sandstone. They extend from Pulaski County, Arkansas to Atoka County, Oklahoma and are home to several popular sites of interest, including Pinnacle Mountain State Park near Little Rock, Arkansas. The highest natural point is Rich Mountain at , which intersects the Arkansas-Oklahoma border near Mena, Arkansas.
The Fourche Mountains are the archetypal Ouachita Mountains. Forested ridges are heavily forested with oak–hickory–pine forest; intervening valleys are cut into shale. Ridges are longer, habitat continuity is greater, the lithologic mosaic is different, and the topographic orientation is more consistent than in other parts of the Ouachitas. Differences in moisture and temperature between north- and south-facing slopes significantly influence native plant communities; they are products of the prevailing topographic trend. Forests on steep, north-facing slopes are more mesic than on southern aspects; the steepest, south-facing slopes contain shallow, moisture deficient soils supporting shrubs and rocky glades or grassy woodlands. Pastureland and hayland are restricted to a few broad valleys. Logging is not nearly as intensive as in the commercial pine plantations of the less rugged Athens Plateau. Nutrient, mineral, and biochemical water quality parameter concentrations are low in the surface waters of the Fourche range, but turbidity can be higher than in other mountainous parts of the Ouachitas. Although most streams stop flowing during the driest part of the summer, enduring deep pools, high quality habitat, and good water quality allow sensitive aquatic species to survive through the summer. They are the only home and namesake of the Fourche Mountain salamander.

The Fourche Mountains form a major watershed divide between the Arkansas River Basin to the north and the Red River Basin to the south.

The Frontal Ouachita Mountains are located in the Arkansas River Valley and feature a number of isolated landforms. The highest natural point is Mount Magazine at , which is also the highest natural point of the Ouachitas and U.S. Interior Highlands. The Frontal Ouachita Mountains are structurally quite different from the rest of the Ouachitas and are sometimes considered a separate range.

The Trap Mountains are located primarily in Garland and Hot Spring counties, Arkansas. The highest natural point is Trap Mountain at .

The Zig Zag Mountains are located in Garland County, Arkansas, and are home to the thermal springs of Hot Springs National Park. They are so named because of their unique chevron shape when viewed from above, the result of plunging anticlines and synclines. The Zig Zag Mountains are not exceptionally tall, but do reach heights over .

==Geology==

The Ouachitas are formed by a thick succession of highly deformed Paleozoic strata constituting the Ouachita Fold and Thrust Belt, which crops out for approximately in western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma. In a general sense, the Ouachitas are considered an anticlinorium because the oldest known rocks are located towards the center of the outcrop area. The Ouachitas continue in the subsurface to the Black Warrior Basin of Alabama and Mississippi where they plunge towards the Appalachian Mountains. To the southwest, the Ouachitas join with the Marathon area of west Texas where rocks of the Ouachita Fold and Thrust Belt are briefly exposed.

Unlike many ranges in the United States, the Ouachitas are mostly east-west trending. They are unique because metamorphism and volcanism, features that are common in orogenic belts, are notably absent (with the exception of some low-grade metamorphism). Due to the high degree of folding and faulting, the Ouachitas are clustered into distinct subranges, with ridges separated by relatively broad valleys.

The Ouachitas are known for some of the world&#x27;s finest quartz, especially around Mount Ida, Arkansas, the quartz capital of the world. The quartz formed after the Ouachita Orogeny when fractures in rocks filled with silica-saturated fluids and, over millions of years, precipitated crystals up to several feet in length. The Ouachitas are also known for novaculite, a variety of chert that has undergone low-grade metamorphism; particular grades found only in Arkansas are used for making whetstones.

===History===
Cambrian through Mississippian strata of the Ouachitas were deposited in a narrow, two-sided basin called the Ouachita Trough, which formed as part of a Cambrian failed rift system. Succeeding Pennsylvanian strata of the Ouachitas were deposited in a foreland basin during the early stages of the Ouachita Orogeny. Subduction of the South American Plate beneath the North American Plate resulted in this mountain-building event. Compressional forces caused the crust to buckle, producing complex folds at all scale levels and several overturned sequences. The area of greatest deformation occurred in the Benton-Broken Bow Uplift, which extends from Benton, Arkansas to Broken Bow, Oklahoma. The total height of the Ouachitas is not known, though they may have exceeded (based loosely on geologic cross-sections). The terrain has been deeply eroded since the late Paleozoic.

===Stratigraphy===
The Ouachitas are composed of Cambrian through Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks. The Collier Shale, located at the core of the Benton-Broken Bow Uplift, is the oldest exposed formation of the Ouachitas. The Atoka Formation, which was deposited much later during the Pennsylvanian, has the largest areal extent of any of the Paleozoic formations in Arkansas.
The geologic formations of the Ouachitas are as follows (in order of ascending age).
==History==
The mountains were home to the Ouachita tribe, for which they were named. Later French explorers translated the name to its present spelling. The first recorded exploration was in 1541 by Hernando de Soto. Later, in 1804, President Jefferson sent William Dunbar and Dr. George Hunter to the area after the Louisiana Purchase. Hot Springs National Park became one of the nation&#x27;s first parks in 1832. The Battle of Devil&#x27;s Backbone was fought here at the ridge of the same name in 1863. In August 1990, the U.S. Forest Service discontinued clearcutting as the primary tool for harvesting and regenerating short leaf, pine and hardwood forests in the Ouachita National Forest.

==Tourism==
The Ouachita Mountains contain the Ouachita National Forest, Hot Springs National Park and Lake Ouachita, as well as numerous state parks and scenic byways mostly throughout Arkansas. They also contain the Ouachita National Recreation Trail, a hiking trail through the heart of the mountains. The trail runs from Talimena State Park in Oklahoma to Pinnacle Mountain State Park near Little Rock. It is a well maintained, premier trail for hikers, backpackers, and mountain bikers (for only selected parts of the trail).

The Talimena Scenic Drive begins at Mena, and traverses of Winding Stair and Rich Mountains, long narrow east-west ridges which extend into Oklahoma. Rich Mountain reaches an elevation of in Arkansas near the Oklahoma border. The two lane winding road is similar in routing, construction, and scenery to the Blue Ridge Parkway of the Appalachian Mountains.

<doc id="325865" wikidata="Q973463" url="?curid=325865" title="Black-chinned hummingbird">
<text>The black-chinned hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri) is a hummingbird occupying a broad range of habitats. Its summer range is in the western United States and southwestern Canada. It is migratory, wintering as far south as Mexico. In sunlight, the gorget of iridescent purple feathers bordering its black chin is noticeable.

==Taxonomy==
The hybrid between the black-chinned hummingbird and Anna&#x27;s hummingbird is called &quot;&quot;Trochilus&quot; violajugulum&quot;. The black-chinned hummingbird is also known to hybridize with Anna&#x27;s, Lucifer, broad-tailed, and Costa&#x27;s hummingbirds.

As of 2011, it has the smallest known genome of all living amniotes, only 0.91 pg (910 million base pairs).

==Description==
The black-chinned hummingbird is long. Adults are metallic green above and white below with green flanks. Their bill is long, straight and slender. The adult male has a black face and chin, a glossy purple gorget, and a dark forked tail. The female has a dark rounded tail with white tips and no throat patch. Juvenile plumage is similar to that of adult females, but with buff margins on the dorsal feathers. Juvenile males may also possess purple feathers on their throats. Juveniles do not have a forked tail like adults.

Young are born almost featherless, but grow a complete set of feathers within three weeks of hatching. Juveniles begin replacing their feathers in November after migrating for the winter. They have a completely new set of feathers before their first year of age.

Similar species to the black-chinned hummingbird include broad-tailed hummingbird, rufous hummingbird, calliope hummingbird, Allen&#x27;s hummingbird, lucifer hummingbird, Anna&#x27;s hummingbird, and Costa&#x27;s hummingbird.

=== Status ===
This species has been labeled as a &quot;least-concern species&quot; because of its broad range (), considerable population size and growth (14.6% increase per decade). Trend maps for black-chinned hummingbirds showed a relatively stable population between 2009 and 2019, albeit with some decline in late years of that decade.
=== Vocalization ===
The vocalization of the black-chinned hummingbird is a rapid, high-pitched chirp.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Black-chinned hummingbirds are found in most of the western United States, reaching north into Canada in Alberta and British Columbia, east to Oklahoma, and as far south as Mexico. They can be found in mountains, woodlands, orchards, meadows, and chaparral habitats. Their breeding habitat is open, semiarid areas, usually near water in the western United States, northern Mexico, and southern British Columbia. They may inhabit moist environments like orchards, shaded canyons, and riparian woods. The males and females of this species use different habitats from one another for breeding territories.

==Behavior and ecology==
=== Breeding ===
This species uses diving displays ( dives) for territory defense and during courtship, producing an audible sound (a &quot;trill&quot;) as air passes through their feathers during the plunge. In courtship, males perform &quot;pendulum&quot; display, flying back and forth in wide U-shaped arcs, making whirring sounds on each dive. They also buzz back and forth in short flights in front of perched females. Black-chinned hummingbirds can exhibit territorial behavior around feeders as well as at other small feeding sites, becoming more defensive during breeding season. However, if there are numerous individuals in an area as well as multiple food sources, this species shows less territoriality.

=== Feeding ===
These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue or catch insects on the wing. While collecting nectar, they also assist in plant pollination.

=== Nesting ===
The female builds a well-camouflaged nest in a protected location in a shrub or tree using plant fibers, spider web silk, downy feathers and lichens. Black-chinned hummingbirds prefer to nest above the ground, often on exposed horizontal branches below the canopy. Research also suggests that they may purposefully nest near the active nests of larger, predatory birds, as a means of reducing nest predation; the larger predators do not prey on the hummingbird, but their presence will deter other birds that might be interested in the black-chinned hummingbird&#x27;s eggs or newly hatched chicks. The female lays two white eggs at a time, each about in diameter, and may breed 2–3 times per year, incubating the eggs for 13–16 days. She feeds the young by inserting her bill deep into their throats and regurgitating insects and nectar. The young fledge at about 20–21 days.

<doc id="325867" wikidata="Q639485" url="?curid=325867" title="Blanchard Springs Caverns">
<text>Blanchard Springs Caverns is a cave system located in the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest in Stone County in northern Arkansas, USA, off Highway 14 a short distance north of Mountain View. It is the only tourist cave owned by the United States Forest Service and the only one owned by the federal government outside the National Park System. Blanchard Springs Caverns is a three-level cave system, all of which can be viewed on guided tours.

The Dripstone Trail runs through the uppermost level of caverns for about a and opened in 1973. The Discovery Trail opened in 1977 and loops through a section of the cavern, descending to the lower level of the cave, underground, as well as to the Natural Entrance, about below ground at that point, following the stream bed of the springs that created the cavern. This trail includes the Rimstone Dams, which create pools along the stream bed, and the Ghost Room, a small but very well decorated room in the uppermost level, with its huge white flowstone. Also offered is a &quot;Wild Cave&quot; tour which allows access to undeveloped parts of the cave to more adventurous visitors. It follows the upstream section of the cave, allowing visitors to see all three levels as the original explorers did, continuing beyond where the Discovery Trail ends.

==History==
Residents knew about the cave by the 1930s and called it Half-Mile Cave. Systematic explorations began in the 1950s and continued sporadically in the 1960s. Explorers discovered a skeleton in the cave in 1955 which was incomplete; a cause of death could not be ascertained. The caverns were opened to the public in 1973 after 10 years of development on the Dripstone Trail.

==Geology==
With of surveyed passage, Blanchard is the second longest cave in Arkansas and the largest in volume. The limestone rock from which the caves and their formations developed was laid down in an ancient sea more than 350 million years ago. The cave is in middle Ordovician to lower Mississippian rocks and extends through six stratigraphic formations. The cave has shown over five levels of passage development, but the upper two levels have eroded away as deepening valleys on the surface cut into them. The cave&#x27;s formation was largely phreatic in nature (formed below the water table) and passages have elliptical cross-sections typical of these formations. During the cave&#x27;s development, active streams have been pirated from one level down to another without much vadose erosion occurring. The present stream currently rises from the cave at Blanchard Springs itself, at the same temperature as the cave, a constant, year-round .

Most of the lower-level Discovery Route is in the approximately thick Plattin limestone whereas the Dripstone tour route in the uppermost level of the cave spans three units, the Boone Chert, Cason Shale and the Fernvale Limestone.

Blanchard remains a &quot;living&quot; cave in part because of the care given by visitors and the United States Forest Service. Thus, the formations inside continue to grow as calcite is actively deposited by seeping and dripping water. One of the outstanding examples of formation growth is the Giant Flowstone, one of the largest in the U.S., at long, wide, and thick.

<doc id="325875" wikidata="Q1470558" url="?curid=325875" title="King Ghidorah">
<text>is a fictional monster, or alien, or &quot;kaiju&quot;, which first appeared in Ishirō Honda&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;. The creature was initially created by Tomoyuki Tanaka, Eiji Tsuburaya, and Shinichi Sekizawa as an homage to the eight-headed mythological Japanese dragon &quot;Yamata no Orochi&quot;. Although the name of the character is officially trademarked by Toho as &quot;King Ghidorah&quot;, the character was originally referred to as Ghidorah, Ghidrah, or Monster Zero in some English markets.

Although King Ghidorah&#x27;s design has remained largely consistent throughout its appearances (an armless, bipedal, golden and yellowish-scaled dragon with three heads, two fan-shaped wings, and two tails), its origin story has varied from being an extraterrestrial planet-destroying dragon, a genetically engineered monster from the future, a guardian monster of ancient Japan, or a god from another dimension. The character is usually portrayed as the archenemy of Godzilla and a foe of Mothra, though it has had one appearance as an ally of the latter.

Despite rumors that Ghidorah was meant to represent the threat posed by China, which had at the time of the character&#x27;s creation just developed nuclear weapons, director Ishirō Honda denied the connection and stated that Ghidorah was simply a modern take on the dragon Yamata no Orochi.

==Overview==
===Development===

According to special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya&#x27;s protégé Teruyoshi Nakano, the initial idea for &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster,&quot; came from Tomoyuki Tanaka, who also created Godzilla. Tanaka&#x27;s inspiration came from an illustration of the Lernaean Hydra in a book about Greek mythology and Orochi of Japanese folklore. Tanaka was enamored with the idea of Godzilla fighting a multi-headed serpent but considered seven or eight heads excessive; thus, the number of heads was reduced to three. The final version, designed by Akira Watanabe, was a three-headed dragon with large wings, two tails, and of extraterrestrial origin.

Toho also drew inspiration from the three-headed dragon Zmey Gorynych or King Dragon in the Japanese version of the 1956 Soviet film &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot;, which had been distributed theatrically in Japan by Shintoho in March 1959. King Ghidorah&#x27;s name is composed of and &quot;Ghidorah&quot;. The &quot;Ghidorah&quot; part of King Ghidorah&#x27;s name comes from the pronunciation of the word &quot;hydra&quot; (Гидра, ˈɡʲidrɐ) in Russian, written as in Japanese.

Other sources of inspiration included mythological creatures such as the hydra, cerberus, unicorn, pegasus, and qilin.

===Abilities===
King Ghidorah&#x27;s primarily attacks by blasting &quot;gravity beams&quot; from its three jaws. These lightning-like attacks are roughly equal in power to Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath, and can be combined to form a stronger blast. King Ghidorah is seen using this ability in all its appearances except for &quot;&quot;, where King Ghidorah&#x27;s form is instead composed of energy resembling gravity beams. King Ghidorah has sometimes shown control over gravity in general, allowing the monster to fly even after losing a wing, crush and destroy thousands of planets (as well as spacefaring craft) sacrificed to it, and cause nearby objects in the environment to float due to its mere presence.

One trait that is seen in all versions of King Ghidorah is its great wings, which it uses to fly at Mach 3 (or 550 knots in &quot;&quot;). In space, it can travel in a meteorite that produces magnetic fields, and fly at speeds exceeding Mach 400. Aside from this, it can use its wings to shield itself from enemy attacks (even Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath), project lightning strikes similar to its gravity beams, and generate supersonic shockwaves and strong winds. Ghidorah&#x27;s electrical properties and generation of powerful bursts of wind cause yellow lightning storms to manifest in its vicinity. The resulting unnatural hurricane can tear through the stratosphere, raise tornadoes and waterspouts, and reach sustained wind speeds of 349 kilometers (217 miles) per hour, strengthening overtime, breaking the Saffir–Simpson scale and exceeding the strength of any known storm on Earth. Although supplementary materials for &quot;&quot; state that this happens when Ghidorah takes flight due to its hyper-tensile tendons, traces of gold in its scales, and electro-receptor molecular biology, in the film proper, the process starts as soon as Ghidorah awakens on the ground. As hinted by several scenes in the film and stated in the novelization, Ghidorah&#x27;s hurricane furthermore disrupts and alters worldwide weather patterns to cause even more storm systems around the world. In the comic &quot;Kingdom Kong&quot;, which takes place in 2019, not even a year after Ghidorah&#x27;s defeat by the end of &quot;King of the Monsters&quot;, the agency of Monarch reports that the storm has reached wind speeds of 644 kilometers (400 miles) per hour, with air pressure so dense that it triggers new cyclones every five minutes and creates waterspouts that reach down to the sea floor. 

In physical combat, King Ghidorah rapidly attacks with kicks and stomps from the air, constriction with one or more necks, electrocuting bites, and even by grabbing enemies to drop them from the sky. In &quot;Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah&quot;, after the character got its central head decapitated by Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath, the humans turned it into a cyborg called Mecha-King Ghidorah, which has a Gravity Laser Cannon fired from its robotic head, electrified grapples and a mechanical arm in its chest for capturing Godzilla.

In &quot;Rebirth of Mothra III&quot;, King Ghidorah can construct a corrosive dome to drain the life force of captured victims for the monster to absorb. It also has the power of hypnosis on eye contact, barrier generation using the light of energy attacks used against it, and regeneration of its entire body from severed body parts. When Mothra traveled back in time to kill Ghidorah, the dragon&#x27;s younger self is shown, less refined and spitting fireballs rather than gravity beams.

In &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;, King Ghidorah can gain power by absorbing the energy of dead monsters and form an energy shield capable of deflecting Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath.

In &quot;&quot;, the third part of an animated trilogy, Ghidorah is depicted as an evolved entity from a universe with different physical laws that are worshiped by the Exif, who it influenced to become nihilists upon mastering advanced Gematron mathematics. While Ghidorah consumed the Exifs&#x27; homeworld, their first offering to it, through its gravitational powers, a few priests were spared and traveled to other worlds where they established cults to sacrifice the converted planets to Ghidorah in the same way. The Exifs summon Ghidorah by having worshippers call out to it in prayer during times of great despair, allowing Ghidorah to physically manifest as a shadow to consume the worshippers through their shadows before its heads finally emerge through black holes. Its necks extend to infinite lengths, nigh-invisible to machines save for the gravitational energy it emanates, strong enough to distort Godzilla&#x27;s heat ray by deflecting it or actually bending the concept of space. As long as someone native to the dimension it invades acts as its guiding anchor and witness, Ghidorah can defy that universe&#x27;s physics, able to render itself intangible to enemy attacks whilst still capable of assaulting foes normally. It can even distort space-time and erode reality, able to change people&#x27;s chronological perception of events and nearly succeeding in &quot;erasing&quot; Godzilla from existence. Though its avatar was rendered tangible to physics by the loss of connection to the priest serving as its key witness (thus allowing Godzilla to destroy its projection through reality), Ghidorah was simply banished back to its dimension, awaiting for another individual to serve as its link to open up its next chance to enter reality and feast. In order to prevent these circumstances from reoccurring, efforts had to be made to eliminate sources of anger, hate, despair, and revenge (achieved by the main character committing suicide with all of Earth&#x27;s remaining machinery).

In &quot;&quot;, Ghidorah has a divergent frontal lobe density in each of its heads, rendering each head capable of independent thoughts and divergent personality traits. Its scales are capable of running bioelectrical currents through its body, aided by traces of gold in its dermal layer, allowing it to raise unnaturally strong storms that gradually increase in power. After draining all of Boston&#x27;s electric power grid by chomping down on a power substation, King Ghidorah is able to unleash chain lightning from the tips of the bones in its wings (referencing its Rebirth of Mothra III incarnation) and later shows more of its vampiric, energy-draining capabilities when it chomps down on Godzilla in a nearly successful attempt to siphon away Godzilla&#x27;s remaining nuclear energy along with the power boost Mothra&#x27;s ashes provided him (referencing a similar attempt made by Keizer Ghidorah in &quot;&quot;). As an alpha, Ghidorah&#x27;s roar is able to awaken and influence other titans around the world into rampaging in the wake of Godzilla&#x27;s supposed death, having taken over as king. Halfway through the film, it displays two &quot;unnatural&quot; abilities that were attributed to - and served as evidence of - its alien nature. The first is the durability to withstand the Oxygen Destroyer, emerging unscathed from the same detonation which severely injured Godzilla and killed all Earth-based lifeforms within a two-mile radius. The second is the possession of highly accelerated regenerative properties, having regrown the left head minutes after Godzilla tore it off, retaining the memories and personality since Ghidorah&#x27;s neurons are spread throughout its body like in an octopus. However, according to the official novelization, a store of energy must be absorbed to do so, which Ghidorah acquired from the highly-radioactive lava of Rodan&#x27;s volcano. Later on, the same power substation Ghidorah consumed to boost itself also healed up the wounds on its wing membranes immediately after it fired lightning from the tips of its wings. Eventually, Godzilla succeeded in incinerating Ghidorah&#x27;s wings, side heads, body, and finally, the middle head, to prevent the alien dragon from coming back. However, Ghidorah was not entirely destroyed, for the head Godzilla bit off during the fight in Mexico remained intact and was salvaged.

In &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, it is revealed that Ghidorah&#x27;s heads communicated with each other via telepathy, as its necks were so long that communication via the nervous system was impractical. Apex Cybernetics, which has acquired Ghidorah&#x27;s skull and brain, is using these telepathic abilities as the basis of a psychic control system for Mechagodzilla. Once Mechagodzilla received an energy source sufficient to power it properly, Ghidorah&#x27;s mind suddenly transferred itself to this new body, frying the pilot to death as it seized total control of the robot.

==Film history==
===Shōwa era (1964–1973)===

In its debut film, &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, Ghidorah is portrayed as an ancient extraterrestrial entity responsible for the destruction of the Venusian civilization, five thousand years before the film&#x27;s events. Its attempt to destroy Earth is thwarted by the combined efforts of Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra.

Subsequent Shōwa era films portrayed Ghidorah as the pawn of various alien races seeking to subjugate Earth. King Ghidorah appears in the fifth and sixth episodes of the television series &quot;Zone Fighter&quot;, where it is revealed that it is supposedly a creation of the Garoga aliens, though it is left unclear as to whether this statement is true or not.

Screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa insisted that the Ghidorah suit be fabricated using light-weight silicone-based materials in order to grant the wearer greater mobility. The final Ghidorah design was constructed by special effects artist Teizo Toshimitsu, who had initially painted it green in order to further differentiate it from Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra, but changed it to gold on the insistence of Eiji Tsuburaya, after his assistant noted that being a creature from Venus, the &quot;gold planet&quot;, Ghidorah should be that color.

The monster suit itself was built by Akira Watanabe, and worn by Shoichi Hirose. Hirose walked hunched over inside the Ghidorah costume, holding a metal bar for balance, while puppeteers would control its heads, tails and wings off-camera like a marionette. The monster&#x27;s heads were each fitted with remotely controlled motors, which were connected to operators via a wire extending from the suit&#x27;s backside.

Performing as Ghidorah proved challenging to Hirose, as he had to time his movements in a way that would not conflict with the separately operated heads and wings, as doing so would have resulted in the overhead wires tangling. Because of the suit&#x27;s weight, it frequently snapped the overhead wires supporting it. Special effects were added as the creature is capable emitting destructive, lightning-like &quot;gravity beams&quot; from its mouths and generating hurricane-force winds from its wings.

Despite King Ghidorah&#x27;s central role in the film&#x27;s plot, the character was given little screen time, as Hirose had fallen out with special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya, who never forgave Hirose for accepting a Hollywood deal, and subsequently he hired Susumu Utsumi to play King Ghidorah after &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot;. In that film, King Ghidorah was given a darker shade of gold, and its movements both on land and in the air were more fluid than during &quot;Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, as the special effects crew had at that point learned from the shortcomings of the previous film&#x27;s depiction of the creature.

===Heisei era (1991–1998)===

In &quot;Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah&quot; (1991), the creature is re-envisioned as a trio of diminutive genetically engineered creatures called owned by a group of humans from the 23rd century known as the Equal Environment Earth Union, a group dedicated to equalizing the power of Earth&#x27;s nations. Seeking to stop Japan&#x27;s global economic dominance in their timeline by transforming the Dorats into King Ghidorah through nuclear exposure, the Earth Unionists plant the Dorats on Lagos Island during the 1954 H-bomb tests there. Prior to doing so, they remove the dinosaur that would ultimately become Godzilla from the island, so that King Ghidorah would be able to attack Japan without opposition. In 1992, the Earth Unionists unleash Ghidorah onto Japan, but it is defeated by a recreated Godzilla. King Ghidorah&#x27;s body stays under the Sea of Okhotsk for two centuries before being recovered by a defected Earth Unionist to make it a cyborg and sent back to 1992 as in order to stop Godzilla&#x27;s rampage.

The character&#x27;s manes were deleted and replaced with horns, as it proved difficult for the special effects team to superimpose the manes into footage of people escaping the monster. Special effects director Koichi Kawakita had originally planned on having each of Ghidorah&#x27;s heads fire differently colored beams, but this was ultimately scrapped in favor of the classic yellow color. This version of King Ghidorah was portrayed by Hurricane Ryu.

In &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; (1993), Mecha-King Ghidorah&#x27;s remains are salvaged by the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center (UNGCC) and used to build Mechagodzilla.

In &quot;Rebirth of Mothra&quot;, a monster named Desghidorah appears, who heavily resembles King Ghidorah but has graphite black skin and a quadrupedal stance.

In &quot;Rebirth of Mothra III&quot; (1998), King Ghidorah is depicted as an extraterrestrial that landed on earth during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era and wiped out the dinosaurs by draining them of their life energies. Ghidorah left Earth and returns in modern times to feed on human children. Mothra fails to defeat the monster and travels back to the Cretaceous in order to kill Ghidorah retroactively. Mothra defeats the younger Ghidorah, but the monster&#x27;s severed tail allows it to regenerate back into its adult form in modern times. After hibernating from the Cretaceous era to the present day, aided by the ancient Primitive Mothra species, Mothra finally kills the monster by transforming into a new form: &quot;Armor Mothra&quot;. This version of King Ghidorah was portrayed by Tsutomu Kitagawa, who would go onto play Godzilla in the Millennium era.

===Millennium era (2001)===

In &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;, Ghidorah is portrayed as having been one of the three Guardians of Yamato, originating 1,000 years before the events of the film. Initially an antagonist, Ghidorah was imprisoned in Mount Fuji, only to be reawakened in 2001 to halt Godzilla&#x27;s destruction of Tokyo. Ghidorah is defeated, but then revived and empowered by ally Mothra.

Director Shūsuke Kaneko had originally planned to use Varan as Godzilla&#x27;s principal antagonist, but was pressured by Toho chairman Isao Matsuoka to use the more recognizable and profitable King Ghidorah, as the previous film in the franchise, &quot;Godzilla vs. Megaguirus&quot;, which featured an original and unfamiliar antagonist, was a box office and critical failure. In order to emphasize Ghidorah&#x27;s heroic role in the movie, the creature&#x27;s size was greatly reduced, and was portrayed by Akira Ohashi, who moved the creature&#x27;s heads as hand puppets.

In &quot;&quot;, a kaiju called appears being based on Ghidorah as the true form of Monster X.

=== Reiwa era (2018–2021) ===

In the post-credits scene of &quot;&quot;, Metphies, a priest of the Exif alien race, reveals to the main character, Haruo Sakaki, the name of the god his people worship: Ghidorah. The entity appears as the main antagonist of &quot;&quot;.

The anime incarnation of Ghidorah is markedly different from its original portrayal, having evolved to the point of discarding its physical body in favor of a form of pure astral energy with two tails, two wings, and three necks that extend infinitely (at least 20 kilometers or 12 miles in length in the film), stretching out of three black hole-like portals to devour planets sacrificed to him by the Exif cult with its gravitational powers while its torso remains within an alternate dimension. In this state, King Ghidorah is completely invulnerable as long as its &#x27;anchor&#x27; remains alive, and is capable of completely ignoring the laws of physics of the dimensions it invades, with its powers including intangibility, the manipulation of thermodynamics, gravity and time through time dilation.

In the anime, Ghidorah is the deity worshipped by the Exif under the titles of &quot;Wings of Death&quot;, &quot;Golden Demise&quot;, and &quot;God of Destruction&quot;. It is summoned to Earth by the cult set up by Metphies in order to destroy Godzilla and devour Earth just as they fed him other planets they visited and converted to the Exif faith. Ghidorah overpowers Godzilla, who is left completely helpless while the interdimensional entity slowly erases it from reality. Metphies, who has linked himself to Ghidorah to serve as his witness to their reality, tries to convince Haruo to take his place as Ghidorah&#x27;s link, since his thirst for revenge against Godzilla makes him the ideal host. Haruo refuses and breaks the link Metphies has to Ghidorah, causing the entity to be affected by conventional physical laws, allowing Godzilla to disperse, defeat, and effectively banish it back to its realm of reality for the time being while Metphies dies in the process. Some time later, Haruo receives a vision from Metphies, telling him that his lingering anger and desire to defeat Godzilla will ensure that Ghidorah will eventually be summoned again. With this, Haruo allows Godzilla to destroy him and all of Earth&#x27;s remaining technology, sacrificing himself to prevent Ghidorah from returning to consume the Earth.

In 2019, King Ghidorah was used in &quot;Godzilla vs. Evangelion: The Real 4-D&quot;, Though this version of Ghidorah was nicknamed &quot;Shin Ghidorah&quot; or &quot;Shin King Ghidorah&quot;. King Ghidorah first shows up in the ride when an explosion condensed into a new shape, released by Shin Godzilla. As it descends on the city and confronts Shin Godzilla, Shin Godzilla fires its atomic breath once again, but Ghidorah uses its gravity powers to deflect the beam in separate directions. Ghidorah then uses its gravity beams to lift several surrounding buildings into the air and throw them at Shin Godzilla, incapacitating it. The Evangelion Units attempt to fight King Ghidorah themselves, but are unable to stop its rampage. As they counter the dragon, Shin Godzilla rises back to its feet to continue battling the enemy. Ghidorah attacks Shin Godzilla, but it uses its dorsal plate beams to counter Ghidorah&#x27;s assault and knock it back, before blasting Ghidorah with its atomic breath until it depletes itself and becomes immobilized. 

As Ghidorah rises again, the three Eva Units continue their effort to fight the monster; Unit-00 and 02 jump on King Ghidorah&#x27;s body but are blasted off by its gravity beams. Unit-01 pulls a sword off of a nearby building and thrusts it into Ghidorah&#x27;s chest, causing it to crash into the city below. For a brief moment, the creature seems defeated, only for Ghidorah to rise completely unharmed from the rubble and turns its attention to the frozen Shin Godzilla to shoot at it with gravity beams. Shin Godzilla&#x27;s body begins to glow again, seemingly using Ghidorah&#x27;s attack to regain it energy. It awakens and fires its atomic breath at Ghidorah, causing to two kaiju&#x27;s beams to lock. Godzilla&#x27;s beam gradually begins to overpower Ghidorah&#x27;s, moving closer until it strikes at Ghidorah, creating a blinding explosion. Once the smoke settles, the Evangelion Units are left completely intact and King Ghidorah is gone, seemingly destroyed by the blast. Having defeated its rival, Shin Godzilla retreats back into the ocean, leaving Osaka-III and the EVA Units peacefully.

In 2021, King Ghidorah was used again in &quot;Godzilla the Ride: Giant Monsters Ultimate Battle&quot;, this time it was redesigned by the ride&#x27;s director Takashi Yamazaki. This version of Ghidorah is first seen ravaging the city with his Gravity Beams, and is spotted by a Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF) soldier, Ghidorah&#x27;s enemy Godzilla arrives in the city approaching from the sea. The unnamed JSDF soldier delivers a safety briefing just before Ghidorah smashes in a wall of the theatre and roars at the guests, only to fly away. Ghidorah&#x27;s Gravity Beams strike a building near the lead vehicle, crushing it with rubble. Ghidorah lands in front of the vehicle, but it drives between his legs. It gives chase, trying and failing to bite it with all three of his heads. Finally it flies ahead of it, lands, and charges forward at full speed. The vehicle soon reverses and hides in the shell of a building, but Ghidorah soon finds the vehicle and snatches it up in the jaws of his middle head. As it flies off from Japan, Rodan shows up and attacks head-on. Ghidorah repulses the new attacker, but drops the vehicle.

The vehicle then deploys its parachutes as the monsters clash each other. Ghidorah prevails easily, throwing Rodan to ground before assailing the smaller winged kaiju with gravity beams. It then breaks the top of the Tokyo Tower off, which the vehicle narrowly avoids, as Godzilla arrives in the city and meets up with Ghidorah. They both roar a challenge and the vehicle lands on Godzilla&#x27;s side and climbs up his shoulder before driving down his tail, soaring into the air once more, and landing on a roof. Ghidorah throws Godzilla to the ground near the building, forcing the vehicle to drive off the roof and deploy parachutes again. Godzilla grabs Ghidorah by the heads and throws it towards the vehicle, which just slips through a gap between his wing and leg.

Ghidorah recovers and pounces, but Godzilla intercepts Ghidorah with a powerful blast of atomic breath, suspending it in mid-air and blasting a hole through its chest. Godzilla roars in victory as the vehicle lands, one of Ghidorah&#x27;s still-living heads then shows up out of nowhere and kept attempting to attack the vehicle. Godzilla squishes the final head of Ghidorah, splashing blue blood fluid and brains everywhere, ending Ghidorah and resulting in Godzilla roaring a victory.

===MonsterVerse (2019–2021)===

In 2014, Legendary Pictures announced their acquisition of the licenses to Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah from Toho to use in their MonsterVerse franchise. The trio were introduced in &quot;&quot; in a post-credits scene depicting cave paintings of all three monsters, including Godzilla.

In June 2017, a press release confirmed Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah would all be featured in &quot;&quot;. In April 2018, Jason Liles, Alan Maxson, and Richard Dorton were cast to provide the motion capture performances of the heads of King Ghidorah, with Liles performing the middle head, Maxson performing the right head, and Dorton performing the left head. Other actors would perform the rest of King Ghidorah&#x27;s body.

This version of Ghidorah stands 521 feet (158.8 meters) tall, weighing 141,056 tons with an unknown wingspan that allows it to fly at a maximum speed of 550 knots. Unlike previous incarnations of the character, Ghidorah&#x27;s three heads are portrayed with independent personalities from each other, although Ghidorah overall still exhibits the inherent sadism of most incarnations: the middle head is the leader and more prominently sadistic than the other two, the right head is angry and thirsty for battle, and the left head is curious, distractable and more submissive - the heads are officially named Ichi, Ni and San respectively (meaning &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Two&quot; and &quot;Three&quot; in Japanese). It is referred to as &quot;Monster Zero&quot; (a reference to &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot;) by the organization Monarch. According to Monarch&#x27;s database, ancient civilizations called the monster &quot;Ghidorah&quot;.

In this incarnation, King Ghidorah is portrayed as a rival apex predator to Godzilla that originated from another world, &quot;[falling] from the stars&quot; in ancient times, who actively seeks to usurp Godzilla&#x27;s domination of the other monsters, proving to be different from most of the known titans due to being actively murderous and genocidal towards humans while threatening to destroy Earth&#x27;s ecosphere. It&#x27;s briefly speculated by the characters that Ghidorah&#x27;s motives behind the destruction are terraforming the Earth into a more ideal environment for himself, though the novelization briefly suggests when discussing said theory that maybe Ghidorah has no higher end-goal than hatefully murdering every living thing that isn&#x27;t him.

Referenced in various myths and said to be the inspiration for the beasts in humanity&#x27;s various Chaoskampf stories, King Ghidorah is shown through ancient cave paintings to have fought against Godzilla and/or its species in the past before, but its nature scared ancient humans enough that the info contained in those myths was left incomplete. King Ghidorah ended up being frozen in Antarctica, discovered by Monarch who proceeded to study the monster until it was freed by eco-terrorists led by Alan Jonah. Godzilla is attracted to Ghidorah&#x27;s activity and they engage in a short battle, but Ghidorah retreats when Monarch&#x27;s military forces intervene; proceeding to Mexico once it senses Rodan being awoken from its own hibernation inside a volcano.

Ghidorah forces Rodan into submission but is then attacked by Godzilla again, who manages to gain the upper hand by dragging the flying monster into the ocean. Godzilla is nearly victorious after completely biting off Ghidorah&#x27;s left head, but in desperation, the human military attempts to kill both Ghidorah and Godzilla by detonating a new weapon called the Oxygen Destroyer. Caught in the blast&#x27;s center; the weapon almost kills Godzilla but is revealed to have no effect on Ghidorah, who flies back to land and within minutes, fully regenerates his severed head, which would eventually allow the humans to deduce that it is in fact an alien with a completely different biology than any known lifeform on Earth. With Godzilla seemingly defeated, Ghidorah becomes the new &quot;alpha&quot; or &quot;king of the monsters&quot;, and puts out a worldwide call that awakens all of the Earth&#x27;s Titans, and commands them to aid him in destroying human civilization and inflicting an extinction event that could wipe out all multicellular life on Earth, with Rodan as his right hand. Ghidorah even starts causing massive electrical storms in the eastern United States, radically altering climate conditions.

When Ghidorah comes to Boston to destroy the Orca device that is negating its hold over the Titans, it battles a revived Godzilla while Mothra fights Rodan. This time, Ghidorah defeats Godzilla after empowering himself by feeding on the city&#x27;s energy supply and throwing Godzilla from a high altitude, but is stopped from killing him thanks to distractions from Mothra (who is killed by Ghidorah in an act of self-sacrifice which enables Godzilla to absorb her life force) and the humans (who use the Orca to distract Ghidorah from sucking Godzilla dry before the latter could use Mothra&#x27;s power boost). Godzilla recovers and uses Mothra&#x27;s power to unleash a series of thermonuclear pulses that obliterate Ghidorah, piece by piece. In a post-credits scene, Jonah and his men are shown Ghidorah&#x27;s previously-severed head from a fisherman in Mexico. He tells the fisherman, &quot;We&#x27;ll take it.&quot;

The tie-in &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; graphic novel &quot;Kingdom Kong&quot; reveals that Ghidorah&#x27;s passage over Mexico during Rodan&#x27;s awakening left an isolated version of his hurricane anchored above the ocean, even after Ghidorah&#x27;s death has enabled the rest of Earth&#x27;s climate to re-stabilize. 2 years later, this storm is drawn towards Skull Island amid the Titan Camazotz&#x27; invasion of the island via the Hollow Earth, and it permanently merges with the perpetual storm barrier surrounding Skull Island, enveloping Skull Island in an endless superstorm which effectively destroys all unprotected life on the island after Camazotz is defeated.

In the 2021 sequel, &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;, set five years after the events of &quot;King of the Monsters&quot;, Ghidorah&#x27;s severed head is being used by Apex Cybernetics&#x27; Ren Serizawa (portrayed by Shun Oguri) to telepathically interface with Mechagodzilla&#x27;s body. Godzilla senses his fallen rival&#x27;s presence, which prompts him to attack the Apex facilities where Mechagodzilla is being built. Eventually, what&#x27;s left of Ghidorah&#x27;s consciousness takes control of the cybernetic Titan, killing Apex CEO Walter Simmons and electrocuting Ren Serizawa, before battling Godzilla in Hong Kong. Ghidorah&#x27;s influence on Mechagodzilla is evident from his desire for unabridged destruction and the senseless killing of humans. Mechagodzilla and Ghidorah&#x27;s consciousness were finally destroyed by the combined efforts of Godzilla and Kong. In the novelization, Ren&#x27;s death is changed so that instead of being electrocuted, his mind is trapped inside Mechagodzilla and overwritten by the Ghidorah-derived mind, and the novel drops hints that Ghidorah&#x27;s consciousness may have possessed Ren&#x27;s body and escaped afterwards.

==In other media==
The various incarnations of King Ghidorah appeared in other media associated with the series, such as video games, television shows, and comics.

===In video games===
King Ghidorah&#x27;s appearance in video games after 1991 usually utilize its Heisei design, combined with traits from other versions.

In the Pipeworks trilogy (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;) and the &quot;Godzilla&quot; game for PlayStation 4, both King Ghidorah and its mechanized counterpart appear as playable characters and enemies.

The eighth level of &quot;Kyoei Toshi&quot;, a 2017 PS4 game where players, as civilians, must escape and survive kaiju attacks, features the Heisei versions of Godzilla and King Ghidorah shooting and biting at each other next to a building the player must enter to retrieve an important package.

In 2024, King Ghidorah and Hedorah were added as downloadable guest fighters in the indie game &quot;GigaBash&quot;, coming two years after Gigan, Godzilla, Mechagodzilla (specifically &quot;Kiryu&quot;, the Millennium Era version), and Destoroyah were introduced as DLCs to the game. Although presented with its Heisei appearance, King Ghidorah also includes traits from its Showa and Monsterverse counterparts in attacks, taunts, and backstory (as it is stated to be an alien invader).

As of 2025, the mobile game &quot;Godzilla: Battle Line&quot; includes Desghidorah, Keizer Ghidorah, Mecha-King Ghidorah and all versions of the standard King Ghidorah (including the one from &quot;Godzilla the Ride: Giant Monsters Ultimate Battle&quot;) except the Showa and &quot;Rebirth of Mothra III&quot; versions.

King Ghidorah appears as a figurine in the limited-time Godzilla DLC for Dave the Diver, which ran from May 23 to November 22, 2024.

===Television===
Stock footage of King Ghidorah from &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; was used in four episodes of &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;: &quot;Courage in the Big Stinkin&#x27; City&quot;, &quot;The Tower of Dr. Zalost&quot;, Fishy Business and &quot;Nowhere TV&quot;. Mostly serving a small role in harmless jumpscares and background footage, the kaiju briefly shoots fire at Courage through a television.

==Appearances==
King Ghidorah appeared in a brief piece of stock footage in &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;. The mechanical head of Mecha-King Ghidorah appears briefly in the opening of &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot;. Spin-off characters based on King Ghidorah (although quadrupedal in appearance) were featured in other Toho films: Desghidorah in &quot;Rebirth of Mothra &quot; and Keizer Ghidorah in &quot;&quot;. A post-credits scene in &quot;&quot; depicts cave paintings of Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah. It was implied that King Ghidorah took over Mechagodzilla&#x27;s consciousness in &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot;. 

British-American hip hop artist Daniel Dumile (known primarily as MF DOOM) released the album &quot;Take Me To Your Leader&quot; (2003) using the artist name &quot;King Geedorah&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover art features an image resembling King Ghidorah and the album features samples from the English versions of various Godzilla films. In 2022, a species of branching worm was named after the monster, &quot;Ramisyllis kingghidorahi&quot;, discovered in the waters around Sado Island. According to scientist Maria Teresa Aguado, the name was selected as &quot;King Ghidorah is a branching fictitious animal that can regenerate its lost ends, so we thought this was an appropriate name for the new species of branching worm&quot;.

==Reception==
The character has been well-received and is considered to be the most famous enemy of Godzilla. IGN listed the creature as #2 on their &quot;Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters&quot; list. &quot;Complex&quot; listed the character as #4 on its &quot;The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time&quot; list, calling it &quot;iconic&quot; and saying that it &quot;... simply looks cooler than some of the more powerful bugs, crabs, and robots.&quot;

In his review of &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, Ethan Reed of &quot;Toho Kingdom&quot; praised King Ghidorah, calling it &quot;a fantastic addition to the franchise&quot; and &quot;no less than pure evil, a relentless force of destruction that wipes out the life of entire planets just for the sake of it&quot; and concluded that &quot;King Ghidorah is not only one [of] the best characters in the series, but one [of] the best movie villains as well.&quot; Similar views were expressed in &quot;Paste&quot;, which listed Ghidorah as #5 on its &quot;10 Best Movie Dragons&quot;, describing it as &quot;probably the deadliest beast in all of Godzilla lore&quot;.

Godzilla historian Steve Ryfle, however, has criticized Ghidorah&#x27;s design in &quot;Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah&quot;, citing its stiff movements and recycled Rodan roar, as well as noting that it did not deviate enough from Eiji Tsuburaya&#x27;s original design.

Following the release of &quot;King of the Monsters&quot;, Ghidorah&#x27;s left head has gained the nickname &quot;Kev/Kevin&quot;. This was following an announcement by Mike Dougherty who released a tweet with the names of Ghidorah&#x27;s head. Due to his seemingly unique personality, Kevin has become the subject of memes.

<doc id="325877" wikidata="Q1191062" url="?curid=325877" title="Phantom limb">
<text>A phantom limb is the sensation that an amputated or missing limb is still attached. It is a chronic condition that is often resistant to treatment. When the cut ends of sensory fibres are stimulated during thigh movements, the patient feels as if the sensation is arising from the non-existent limb. Sometimes, the patient might feel pain in the non-existent limb. Approximately 80–100% of individuals with an amputation experience sensations in their amputated limb. However, only a small percentage will experience painful phantom limb sensations (phantom pain). These sensations are relatively common in amputees and usually resolve within two to three years without treatment. Research continues to explore the underlying mechanisms of phantom limb pain (PLP) and effective treatment options.

==Signs and symptoms==

Most (80–100%) amputees experience a phantom limb, with some of them having non-painful sensations. The amputee may feel very strongly that the phantom limb is still part of the body.

People will sometimes feel as if they are gesturing, feel itches, twitch, or even try to pick things up. The missing limb often feels shorter and may feel as if it is in a distorted and painful position. Occasionally, the pain can be made worse by stress, anxiety and weather changes. Exposure to extreme weather conditions, especially below freezing temperatures, can cause increased sensitivity to the sensation. Phantom limb pain is usually intermittent, but can be continuous in some cases. The frequency and intensity of attacks usually declines with time.

Repressed memories in phantom limbs could potentially explain the reason for existing sensations after amputation. Specifically, there have been several reports from patients of painful clenching spasms in the phantom hand with the feeling of their nails digging into their palms. The motor output is amplified due to the missing limb; therefore, the patient may experience the overflow of information as pain. The patient contains repressed memories from previous motor commands of clenching the hand and sensory information from digging their nails into their palm. These memories remain due to previous neural connections in the brain.

==Phantom limb syndrome==

Despite the term &quot;phantom limb&quot; not being coined until 1871 by a physician named Silas Weir Mitchell, there have been earlier reports of the phenomenon. One of the first known medical descriptions of the phantom limb phenomenon was written by a French military surgeon, Ambroise Pare, in the sixteenth century. Pare noticed that some of his patients continued reporting pain in the removed limb after he performed the amputation. For many years, the dominant hypothesis for the cause of phantom limbs was irritation in the peripheral nervous system at the amputation site (neuroma). By the late 1980s, Ronald Melzack had recognized that the peripheral neuroma account could not be correct, because many people born without limbs also experienced phantom limbs. According to Melzack the experience of the body is created by a wide network of interconnecting neural structures, which he called the &quot;neuromatrix&quot;.

Pons and colleagues (1991) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) showed that the primary somatosensory cortex in macaque monkeys undergoes substantial reorganization after the loss of sensory input.

Hearing about these results, V. S. Ramachandran hypothesized that phantom limb sensations in humans could be due to reorganization in the human brain&#x27;s somatosensory cortex. Ramachandran and colleagues illustrated this hypothesis by showing that stroking different parts of the face led to perceptions of being touched on different parts of the missing limb. Later brain scans of amputees showed the same kind of cortical reorganization that Pons had observed in monkeys. Ramachandran have also performed the world&#x27;s first phantom limb amputation surgeries by asking patients to visualize the missing limb, which relieved pain, and in the long term completely removed the sensation of a phantom limb – the method is now known as the mirror therapy.

Maladaptive changes in the cortex may account for some but not all phantom limb pain. Pain researchers such as Tamar Makin (Oxford) and Marshall Devor (Hebrew University, Jerusalem) argue that phantom limb pain is primarily the result of &quot;junk&quot; inputs from the peripheral nervous system. Despite a great deal of research on the underlying neural mechanisms of phantom limb pain there is still no clear consensus as to its cause. Both the brain and the peripheral nervous system may be involved.

Research continues into more precise mechanisms and explanations.

=== Differentiation of limb sensations ===
Phantom limb syndrome (PLS) is a sensation that the amputated or missing limb is still attached to the body. This is different from residual limb pain (RLP) that is often experienced by people with amputations. While RLP occurs in the remaining or residual body part, the pain or sensation associated with PLS can be experienced in the entire limb or just one portion of the missing limb. Phantom limb can also present itself in two ways: phantom limb pain or phantom limb sensations. Phantom limb pain is a painful or unpleasant sensation experienced where the amputated limb was. Phantom sensations are any other, nonpainful sensations perceived in the amputated or missing limb area.

==== Types of phantom sensations ====
There are 3 differentiated types of phantom sensations: kinetic, kinesthetic, and exteroceptive. Kinetic phantom sensations are perceived movements of the amputated body part (i.e., feeling your toes flex). Kinesthetic phantom sensations are related to the size, shape, or position of the amputated body part (i.e., feeling as if your hand is in a twisted position). Exteroceptive phantom sensations are related to sensations perceived to be felt by the amputated body part (i.e., feelings of touch, pressure, tingling, temperature, itch, and vibrations).

An additional sensation that some people with amputations experience is known as telescoping. Telescoping is when you feel as if your amputated limb is becoming more proximal to your body through progressive shortening.

===Neural mechanisms===
Pain, temperature, touch, and pressure information are carried to the central nervous system via the anterolateral system (spinothalamic tracts, spinoreticular tract, spinomesencefalic tract), with pain and temperature information transferred via lateral spinothalamic tracts to the primary sensory cortex, located in the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe, where sensory information is represented somatotropically, forming the sensory homunculus. Somatotopic representation seems to be a factor in the experience of phantom limb, with larger regions in the sensory homunculus typically experiencing more phantom sensations or pain. These areas include the hands, feet, fingers and toes.

In phantom limb syndrome, there is sensory input indicating pain from a part of the body that is no longer existent. This phenomenon is still not fully understood, but it is hypothesized that it is caused by activation of the somatosensory cortex. One theory is it may be related to central sensitization, which is a common experience among amputees. Central sensitization is when there are changes in the responsiveness of the neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which deals with processing somatosensory information, due to increased activity from the peripheral nociceptors. Peripheral nociceptors are sensory neurons that alert us to potentially damaging stimuli.

There are theories that the phantom limb phenomenon may relate to reorganization of the somatosensory cortex after the limb is removed. When the body receives tactile input near the residual limb, the brain is convinced that the sensory input was received from the amputated limb because another brain region took over. Reorganization has been thought to be related to sensory-discriminative parts of pain as well as the affective-emotional parts of it (I.e., insula, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the frontal cortices).

Phantom sensations can also occur when there has been a peripheral nerve injury resulting in deafferentation. This causes changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which normally has an inhibitory effect on sensory transmission.

==Treatment==
Most approaches to treatment over the past two decades have not shown consistent symptom improvement. Treatment approaches have included medication such as antidepressants, spinal cord stimulation, vibration therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, and biofeedback. Reliable evidence is lacking on whether any treatment is more effective than the others.

Most treatments are not very effective. Ketamine or morphine may be useful around the time of surgery. Morphine may be helpful for longer periods of time. Evidence for gabapentin is mixed. Perineural catheters that provide local anesthetic agents have poor evidence of success when placed after surgery in an effort to prevent phantom limb pain.

One approach that has received public interest is the use of a mirror box. The mirror box provides a reflection of the intact hand or limb that allows the patient to &quot;move&quot; the phantom limb, and to unclench it from potentially painful positions.

Although mirror therapy was introduced by VS Ramachandran in the early 1990s, little research was done on it before 2009, and much of the subsequent research has been of poor quality, according to a 2016 review. A 2018 review, which also criticized the scientific quality of many reports on mirror therapy (MT), found 15 good-quality studies conducted between 2012 and 2017 (out of a pool of 115 publications), and concluded that &quot;MT seems to be effective in relieving PLP, reducing the intensity and duration of daily pain episodes. It is a valid, simple, and inexpensive treatment for PLP.&quot;

==Other phantom sensations==
Phantom sensations may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye (phantom eye syndrome).

Phantom sensations have been noted in the transgender population. Some people who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) have reported the sensation of phantom genitals. The reports were less common among post-operative transgender women, but did occur in transgender men. Phantom penises in pre-SRS transgender men have been documented to be similar to the rate of phantom sensations in cis men post-penectomy. Similarly, subjects who had undergone mastectomy reported experiencing phantom breasts; these reports were substantially less common among post-operative transgender men.

<doc id="325880" wikidata="Q214508" url="?curid=325880" title="Elephant bird">
<text>Elephant birds are extinct flightless birds belonging to the order Aepyornithiformes that were native to the island of Madagascar. They are thought to have gone extinct around AD 1000, likely as a result of human activity. Elephant birds comprised three species, one in the genus &quot;Mullerornis&quot;, and two in &quot;Aepyornis.&quot; &quot;Aepyornis maximus&quot; is possibly the largest bird to have ever lived, with their eggs being the largest known for any amniote. Elephant birds are palaeognaths (whose flightless representatives are often known as ratites), and their closest living relatives are kiwi (found only in New Zealand), suggesting that ratites did not diversify by vicariance during the breakup of Gondwana but instead convergently evolved flightlessness from ancestors that dispersed more recently by flying.

== Discovery ==
Elephant birds have been extinct since at least the 17th century. Étienne de Flacourt, a French governor of Madagascar during the 1640s and 1650s, mentioned an ostrich-like bird, said to inhabit unpopulated regions, although it is unclear whether he was repeating folk tales from generations earlier. In 1659, Flacourt wrote of the &quot;vouropatra – a large bird which haunts the Ampatres and lays eggs like the ostriches; so that the people of these places may not take it, it seeks the most lonely places.&quot; There has been speculation, especially popular in the latter half of the 19th century, that the legendary roc from the accounts of Marco Polo was ultimately based on elephant birds, but this is disputed.

Between 1830 and 1840, European travelers in Madagascar saw giant eggs and eggshells. British observers were more willing to believe the accounts of giant birds and eggs because they knew of the moa in New Zealand. In 1851 the genus &quot;Aepyornis&quot; and species &quot;A. maximus&quot; were scientifically described in a paper presented to the Paris Academy of Sciences by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, based on bones and eggs recently obtained from the island, which resulted in wide coverage in the popular presses of the time, particularly due to their very large eggs.

Two whole eggs have been found in dune deposits in southern Western Australia, one in the 1930s (the Scott River egg) and one in 1992 (the Cervantes egg); both have been identified as &quot;Aepyornis maximus&quot; rather than &quot;Genyornis newtoni,&quot; an extinct giant bird known from the Pleistocene of Australia. It is hypothesized that the eggs floated from Madagascar to Australia on the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Evidence supporting this is the finding of two fresh penguin eggs that washed ashore on Western Australia but may have originated in the Kerguelen Islands, and an ostrich egg found floating in the Timor Sea in the early 1990s.

== Taxonomy and biogeography ==
Like the ostrich, rhea, cassowary, emu, kiwi and extinct moa, elephant birds were ratites; they could not fly, and their breast bones had no keel. Because Madagascar and Africa separated before the ratite lineage arose, elephant birds are thought to have dispersed and become flightless and gigantic &quot;in situ&quot;.

More recently, it has been deduced from DNA sequence comparisons that the closest living relatives of elephant birds are New Zealand kiwi, though the split between the two groups is deep, with the two lineages being estimated to have diverged from each other around 54 million years ago.

Placement of Elephant birds within Palaeognathae, after: 

The ancestors of elephant birds are thought to have arrived in Madagascar well after Gondwana broke apart. The existence of possible flying palaeognathae in the Miocene such as &quot;Proapteryx&quot; further supports the view that ratites did not diversify in response to vicariance. Gondwana broke apart in the Cretaceous and their phylogenetic tree does not match the process of continental drift. Madagascar has a notoriously poor Cenozoic terrestrial fossil record, with essentially no fossils between the end of the Cretaceous (Maevarano Formation) and the Late Pleistocene. Complete mitochondrial genomes obtained from elephant birds eggshells suggest that &quot;Aepyornis&quot; and &quot;Mullerornis&quot; are significantly genetically divergent from each other, with a molecular clock analysis estimating the split around 27 million years ago. Molecular dating estimates that the divergence between Aepyornithidae and Mullerornithidae occurred approximately 30 Ma, close to the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, a period of marked global cooling and faunal turnover in the Northern Hemisphere.

=== Species ===
Up to 10 or 11 species in the genus &quot;Aepyornis&quot; have been described, but the validity of many have been disputed, with numerous authors treating them all in just one species, &quot;A. maximus&quot;. Up to three species have been described in &quot;Mullerornis&quot;. Recent work has restricted the number of elephant bird species to three, with two in &quot;Aepyornis&quot;, one in &quot;Mullerornis&quot;. 
* Order Aepyornithiformes [Aepyornithes ]
** Genus &quot;Aepyornis&quot; (Synonym: &quot;Vorombe&quot; )
*** &quot;Aepyornis hildebrandti&quot; (Possibly divided into two subspecies) 
*** &quot;Aepyornis maximus&quot; 
** Genus &quot;Mullerornis&quot; 4
*** &quot;Mullerornis modestus&quot; 
All elephant birds are usually placed in the single family Aepyornithidae, but some authors suggest &quot;Aepyornis&quot; and &quot;Mullerornis&quot; should be placed in separate families within the Aepyornithiformes, with the latter placed into Mullerornithidae.

== Description ==
Elephant birds were large sized birds (the largest reaching tall in normal standing posture) that had vestigial wings, long legs and necks, with small heads relative to body size, which bore straight, thick conical beaks that were not hooked. The tops of elephant bird skulls display punctuated marks, which may have been attachment sites for fleshy structures or head feathers. &quot;Mullerornis&quot; is the smallest of the elephant birds, with a body mass of around , with its skeleton much less robustly built than &quot;Aepyornis&quot;. &quot;A. hildebrandti&quot; is thought to have had a body mass of around . Estimates of the body mass of &quot;Aepyornis maximus&quot; span from around to making it one of the largest birds ever, alongside &quot;Dromornis stirtoni&quot; and &quot;Pachystruthio dmanisensis&quot;. Females of &quot;A. maximus&quot; are suggested to have been larger than the males, as is observed in other ratites.

== Biology ==

Examination of brain endocasts has shown that both &quot;A. maximus&quot; and &quot;A. hildebrandti&quot; had greatly reduced optic lobes, similar to those of their closest living relatives, the kiwis, and consistent with a similar nocturnal lifestyle. The optic lobes of &quot;Mullerornis&quot; were also reduced, but to a lesser degree, suggestive of a nocturnal or crepuscular lifestyle. &quot;A. maximus&quot; had relatively larger olfactory bulbs than &quot;A. hildebrandti&quot;, suggesting that the former occupied forested habitats where the sense of smell is more useful while the latter occupied open habitats.

=== Diet ===
A 2022 isotope analysis study suggested that some specimens of &quot;Aepyornis&quot; &quot;hildebrandti&quot; were mixed feeders that had a large (~48%) grazing component to their diets, similar to that of the living &quot;Rhea americana&quot;, while the other species (&quot;A. maximus&quot;, &quot;Mullerornis modestus&quot;) were probably browsers. It has been suggested that &quot;Aepyornis&quot; straightened its legs and brought its torso into an erect position in order to browse higher vegetation. Some rainforest fruits with thick, highly sculptured endocarps, such as that of the currently undispersed and highly threatened forest coconut palm (&quot;Voanioala gerardii&quot;), may have been adapted for passage through ratite guts and consumed by elephant birds, and the fruit of some palm species are indeed dark bluish-purple (e.g., &quot;Ravenea louvelii&quot; and &quot;Satranala decussilvae&quot;), just like many cassowary-dispersed fruits, suggesting that they too may have been eaten by elephant birds. 

=== Growth and reproduction ===
Elephant birds are suggested to have grown in periodic spurts rather than having continuous growth. An embryonic skeleton of &quot;Aepyornis&quot; is known from an intact egg, around 80–90% of the way through incubation before it died. This skeleton shows that even at this early ontogenetic stage that the skeleton was robust, much more so than comparable hatchling ostriches or rheas, which may suggest that hatchlings were precocial.

The eggs of &quot;Aepyornis&quot; are the largest known for any amniote, and have a volume of around , a length of approximately and a width of . The largest &quot;Aepyornis&quot; eggs are on average thick, with an estimated weight of approximately . Eggs of &quot;Mullerornis&quot; were much smaller, estimated to be only thick, with a weight of about . The large size of elephant bird eggs means that they would have required substantial amounts of calcium, which is usually taken from a reservoir in the medullary bone in the femurs of female birds. Possible remnants of this tissue have been described from the femurs of &quot;A. maximus.&quot;

== Extinction ==
It is widely believed that the extinction of elephant birds was a result of human activity. The birds were initially widespread, occurring from the northern to the southern tip of Madagascar. The late Holocene also witnessed the extinction of other Malagasy animals, including several species of Malagasy hippopotamus, two species of giant tortoise (&quot;Aldabrachelys abrupta&quot; and &quot;Aldabrachelys grandidieri&quot;), the giant fossa, over a dozen species of giant lemurs, the aardvark-like animal &quot;Plesiorycteropus,&quot; and the crocodile &quot;Voay&quot;.&quot;&quot; Several elephant bird bones with incisions have been dated to approximately 10,000 BC which some authors suggest are cut marks, which have been proposed as evidence of a long history of coexistence between elephant birds and humans; however, these conclusions conflict with more commonly accepted evidence of a much shorter history of human presence on the island and remain controversial. The oldest securely dated evidence for humans on Madagascar dates to the mid-first millennium AD.

A 2021 study suggested that elephant birds, along with the Malagasy hippopotamus species, became extinct in the interval 800–1050 AD (1150–900 years Before Present), based on the timing of the latest radiocarbon dates. The timing of the youngest radiocarbon dates co-incided with major environmental alteration across Madagascar by humans changing forest into grassland, probably for cattle pastoralism, with the environmental change likely being induced by the use of fire. This reduction of forested area may have had cascade effects, like making elephant birds more likely to be encountered by hunters, though there is little evidence of human hunting of elephant birds. Humans may have utilized elephant bird eggs. Introduced diseases (hyperdisease) have been proposed as a cause of extinction, but the plausibility for this is weakened due to the evidence of centuries of overlap between humans and elephant birds on Madagascar.

<text>Roberto Alagna (; born 7 June 1963) is a French operatic tenor. He obtained French citizenship in 1981, while also retaining his previous Italian citizenship.

==Early years==
Alagna was born in Clichy-sous-Bois, outside the city of Paris, in 1963 to a family of Sicilian immigrants. As a teenager, the young Alagna began busking and singing pop in Parisian cabarets, mostly for tips. Influenced primarily by the films of Mario Lanza and learning from recordings of many historic tenors, he then switched to opera, but remained largely self-taught. He was discovered by Gabriel Dussurget, the co-founder of the Aix-en-Provence Festival. He had performed frequently with Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu, whom he first met in 1992 and married in 1996, in concerts and opera productions until their eventual divorce in 2013.

==Career==
After winning the Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition, an initiative backed by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, that started in Modena in 1988, Alagna made his professional debut as Alfredo Germont in &quot;La traviata&quot; with the Glyndebourne touring company. This led to many engagements throughout the smaller cities in France and Italy, mainly again as Alfredo, a role he would eventually sing over 150 times. His reputation grew and he was soon invited to sing at major theatres such as La Scala in 1990, Covent Garden in 1992 and the Metropolitan Opera as Rodolfo in 1996. His performances of Roméo in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; by Charles Gounod at Covent Garden in 1994 (opposite Leontina Vaduva) catapulted him to international stardom.

Alagna opened the 2006/07 season at La Scala on 7 December 2006 in the new production of &quot;Aida&quot; by Franco Zeffirelli. During the second performance on 10 December, Alagna, whose opening performance was considered ill-at-ease, was booed and whistled from the &quot;loggione&quot; (the least expensive seats at the very back of La Scala), and he walked off the stage. The tenor&#x27;s reaction to his public criticism was denounced as immature and unprofessional by La Scala management and Zeffirelli, who said, &quot;A professional should never behave in this way. Alagna is too sensitive, it is too easy to hurt his feelings. He does not know how to act like a true star.&quot; The role of Radames was taken over successfully for the rest of the performance by his understudy Antonello Palombi, who entered on stage wearing jeans and a black shirt.

In 2007 while at the Metropolitan Opera singing the role of Pinkerton in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, Alagna replaced the indisposed tenor Rolando Villazón as Romeo in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; opposite soprano Anna Netrebko for two performances in September and two performances in December. Alagna was also engaged by the Metropolitan Opera at the last minute to cover for the indisposed Marco Berti in a 16 October 2007 performance of &quot;Aida&quot;. After the performance, the audience gave him a standing ovation. The 15 December performance of &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; starring Alagna and Netrebko was broadcast by the Met into 447 theatres worldwide in high definition and seen by about 97,000 people.

In recent years, Alagna has been an advocate of restoring to prominence neglected French operas – Alfano&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Le jongleur de Notre-Dame&quot;, Lalo&#x27;s &quot;Fiesque&quot;, and new works – Vladimir Cosma&#x27;s &quot;Marius et Fanny&quot; and his brother David Alagna&#x27;s &quot;Le dernier jour d&#x27;un condamné&quot;. He has also recorded light music with an homage album to Luis Mariano, &quot;Sicilien&quot;, and &quot;Pasión&quot;.

Alagna was scheduled to make his debut at the Bayreuth Festival on opening day, 25 July 2018, in the title role of a new production of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. Alagna withdrew from the festival on 29 June 2018 citing failure to learn the role in time.

==Personal life==
Alagna&#x27;s first wife, Florence Lancien, died of a brain tumour in 1994; they had one daughter, Ornella, who was born in 1992. In 1996, he married Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu, having met her in 1992 in the London &quot;Bohème&quot; production. The couple announced a divorce in 2009, but had reunited by 2011. However, in January 2013, the couple mutually agreed on a formal divorce. Alagna and Polish soprano Aleksandra Kurzak had begun a relationship, and their daughter, Malena, was born on 29 January 2014. Alagna and Kurzak married in 2015.

Alagna has worked together on several projects with his brothers Frédérico Alagna and the stage director and composer David Alagna. The three brothers recorded an album of light music, &quot;Serenades&quot;, and worked together on the younger brother David&#x27;s opera based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Day of a Condemned Man&quot;. Alagna has often sung Alfano&#x27;s Cyrano opposite his sister-in-law Nathalie Manfrino as Roxane.

The government of France named Alagna Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2008.

<text>Clear Lake City is a master-planned community located in southeast Harris County, Texas, within the Bay Area of Greater Houston. It is the second-largest master-planned community in Houston – behind Kingwood. The majority of the community lies in the corporate limits of Houston, and a small eastern portion within the city limits of Taylor Lake Village.

The community is adjacent to NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center, as well as other major aerospace companies—including Boeing and Lockheed-Martin. The community and its adjacent areas have a high concentration of engineers due to both NASA and the local petrochemical and biomedical industries.

==History==
The first substantial development on the land Clear Lake City now occupies was accomplished by James Marion West, who came to Texas from Mississippi as a boy in 1880. West became a wealthy businessman with interests in ranching, lumber, and oil. His main ranch property and the site of his home was around the shores of Clear Lake and Clear Creek.

Humble Oil (now ExxonMobil) purchased the property from West in 1938 after oil was discovered. Most of the property remained undeveloped until, following the decision to establish the Johnson Space Center in the area, Humble Oil&#x27;s venture, the Friendswood Development Company, made plans to establish a residential development. The company established the Clear Lake City Community Association, Inc. (CLCCA) in 1963.

Clear Lake City was the former location of the Clear Lake City STOLport, a private airport constructed and owned by Houston Metro Airlines which was located on State Highway 3 just south of Ellington Field. This commuter airline operated up to 22 roundtrip flights every weekday in the mid-1970s between Clear Lake City (CLC) and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) with de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL (short take off and landing) turboprop aircraft. Metro Airlines eventually ceased operations due to financial challenges. The Clear Lake City STOLport was subsequently abandoned and then demolished. There is no trace of this pioneering airfield to be found at the present time, and the land has been developed for commercial and residential use.

The portion of Clear Lake City that was Houston&#x27;s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) was annexed by the city of Houston in 1977 despite a grass-roots campaign by its residents to stop it. Their slogan was &quot;Free The Clear Lake 25,000!&quot; Lawsuits over the annexation resulted in the conversion of Houston city government from at-large city councilmen to the current-day nine district and five at-large council seats. The 1977 annexation added of land to the Houston city limits. At the time, under a Texas law established in 1963, a city of more than 100,000 people could unilaterally annex an unincorporated area. Proponents stated that the annexation allowed Houston to maintain a healthy tax base which would therefore keep taxes low and stimulate economic growth. This meant Texas cities would avoid the fates of Northern cities, locked in by other cities, which saw their tax bases relocate out of their respective city limits.

The eastern portion in Pasadena&#x27;s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) was eventually annexed by the city of Pasadena.

Since 1980, part of Clear Lake City within the Houston City Limits is located in Council District E. 

From the 1980 U.S. Census to the 1990 Census, many Asian-Americans settled in Clear Lake City. They were mostly Chinese American, Indian American, and Pakistani American with some Vietnamese Americans.

==Etymology==
The community was named Clear Lake City for Clear Lake, which lies south of the Johnson Space Center and, along with Clear Creek, separates Harris County from Galveston County. The lake is effectively the mouth of Clear Creek which empties into Galveston Bay.

==Government and infrastructure==

===Local government===

The Clear Lake City Water Authority serves the community. The authority was created on May 6, 1963, by House Bill 1003 during the regular session of the 58th Legislature of Texas. When it was created the authority had of land in its jurisdiction. Due to annexations, as of 2009 the authority now has of land in its jurisdiction.

Houston City Council District E serves portions of Clear Lake City within Houston.

Harris Health System (formerly Harris County Hospital District) designated Strawberry Health Center in Pasadena for ZIP code 77058. The nearest public hospital is Ben Taub General Hospital in the Texas Medical Center.

==== Fire service ====
The area was served from 1963 until sometime in the mid- to late-1990s by the Clear Lake City Volunteer Fire Department (CLCVFD). The CLCCA funded the CLCVFD and the CLCWA provided the fire station and surrounding land. When the CLCVFD ceased operations due to reduced funding as a result of Houston&#x27;s annexation of the majority of CLCVFD&#x27;s service area, the building did a brief stint as the headquarters of the Clear Lake Emergency Medical Corps (CLEMC). The building is currently a maintenance depot for the CLCWA, which has held title to the building and surrounding land since the CLCWA&#x27;s inception. The fire departments of Houston, Pasadena, and Taylor Lake Village currently serve sections of Clear Lake City. The Houston Fire Department serves areas of Clear Lake City within the City of Houston limits. In 1978, City of Houston officials contracted with the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center to open a fire station on the base. The city introduced plans to provide services for the Pipers Meadow area, which was annexed in 1994. A new Houston fire station #94 serving Piper&#x27;s Meadow, Sterling Knoll, and surrounding areas within the city was built in January 2005. This new fire station had a price of $2,644,438.

==== Police service ====
The police departments of Houston, Pasadena, and Taylor Lake Village serve sections of Clear Lake City. The Houston Police Department serves areas of Clear Lake City within the City of Houston limits. The Clear Lake Patrol Division serves the portion of Clear Lake City in Houston. Pasadena Police Department is the police department for Pasadena. The police department for Taylor Lake Village is the Lakeview Police Department, formed in January 1987 by a merger of the police departments of Taylor Lake Village and El Lago. Police protection is also provided by the Harris County Sheriff&#x27;s Office (HCSO) and the Harris County Precinct 8 Constable&#x27;s Office (HCCO Pct 8).

===County, state, and federal representation===
Harris County operates the County Courthouse Bay Area Annex, including a tax office, on Buccaneer Lane in Clear Lake City, Houston.

The United States Postal Service operates the Albert Thomas Post Office on El Camino Real Drive in Houston and the Nassau Bay Post Office on Upper Bay Road in Nassau Bay, near Clear Lake City.

The growth of the subdivisions in Clear Lake resulted from the employment of thousands of people by NASA&#x27;s then-new Manned Spacecraft Center (now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center). Land values rose nearly 300%.

In the neighborhood of Timber Cove, the local pool was designed in the shape of the Mercury capsule. It was completed in 1963.

Five high schools in the district, Clear Lake High School, Clear Creek High School,Clear Springs High School,Clear View High School and Clear Brook High School, serve the community.

Clear Lake Intermediate School and Space Center Intermediate School serve sections of Clear Lake City. Clear Lake Intermediate was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 1986–87.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston operates the St. Clare of Assisi school in the community. St. Bernadette Catholic Church also offers early childhood education. The Clear Lake Christian School is located in the Bay Knoll neighborhood in Clear Lake City.

=== Colleges and universities ===

The University of Houston–Clear Lake is adjacent to the community (the majority of the UHCL campus lies in the corporate limits of Pasadena, while the part of campus south of Horsepen Bayou lies in the city of Houston).

Residents of the Harris County part of Clear Creek ISD (and therefore Clear Lake City) are zoned to San Jacinto College.

==Properties==
From 1961 until 1992, the Lunar and Planetary Institute was housed in the mansion until it moved to a bigger, more modern building. In 2013 the property was sold to former basketball player Hakeem Olajuwon&#x27;s property management company, and for years it was a high-end men&#x27;s clothing store called DR34M (&quot;Dream&quot;, after Olajuwon&#x27;s nickname and with a stylized &quot;34&quot; representing his jersey number). The mansion was demolished in November 2019.

===Public libraries===

The Clear Lake City–County Freeman Branch is administered by Harris County Public Library, and is funded in part by the Houston Public Library. The Freeman Branch Library, named after Theodore C. Freeman, opened in 1964. It moved to the Harris County multipurpose annex in 1976. The current city-county facility opened in 2004. The Friends of the Freeman Library raises $80,000 annually to fund the library.

<text>Roméo et Juliette is a seven-movement &quot;symphonie dramatique&quot; for orchestra and three choruses, with vocal solos, by French composer Hector Berlioz. Émile Deschamps wrote its libretto with Shakespeare&#x27;s play as his base. The work was completed in 1839 and first performed on 24 November of that year, but it was modified before its first publication, in 1847, and modified again for the &quot;2ème Édition&quot; of 1857, today&#x27;s reference. It bears the catalogue numbers Op. 17 and H. 79. Regarded as one of Berlioz&#x27;s finest achievements, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; is also among his most original in form and his most comprehensive and detailed to follow a program. The vocal forces are used in the 1st, 5th and 7th movements. 

==Composition==

===Genesis===

Initial inspiration came from a performance he witnessed in 1827 of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (in David Garrick&#x27;s edited version) at the Odéon Theatre in Paris. The cast included Harriet Smithson, who also inspired Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Berlioz describes the electrifying effect of the drama:
... to steep myself in the fiery sun and balmy nights of Italy, to witness the drama of that passion swift as thought, burning as lava, radiantly pure as an angel&#x27;s glance, imperious, irresistible, the raging vendettas, the desperate kisses, the frantic strife of love and death, was more than I could bear. By the third act, scarcely able to breathe—it was as though an iron hand had gripped me by the heart—I knew that I was lost. I may add that at the time I did not know a word of English; I could only glimpse Shakespeare darkly through the mists of Letourneur&#x27;s translation; the splendour of the poetry which gives a whole new glowing dimension to his glorious works was lost on me. ... But the power of the acting, especially that of Juliet herself, the rapid flow of the scenes, the play of expression and voice and gesture, told me more and gave me a far richer awareness of the ideas and passions of the original than the words of my pale and garbled translation could do.
The range of feeling and mood as well as poetic and formal invention which Berlioz found in Shakespeare had a strong influence on his music, making a direct musical setting of Shakespeare&#x27;s work only natural. In fact, he had been planning a musical realisation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for a long time before 1838, but other projects intervened. Emile Deschamps (the librettist of the work) says that he and Berlioz worked out a plan for the symphony shortly after the Odéon&#x27;s 1827/28 season. Indeed, it may be the case that &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;″s genesis is intertwined with other works composed before the composer left for his Prix de Rome sojourn of 1830 to 1832. &quot;Sardanapale&quot;, the cantata with which Berlioz finally won the Prix de Rome in 1830, puts the melodic material of both the &quot;Roméo seul&quot; (&quot;Romeo alone&quot;) portion of the second movement and the &quot;Grande fête chez Capulet&quot; (&quot;Great banquet at the Capulets&quot;).

There is abundant evidence that Berlioz was gradually working out a scheme for &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; during his sojourn in Italy. He reviewed a February 1831 performance in Florence of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot;, outlining in passing how he would compose music for the &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; story: it would feature, he says, the sword fight, a concert of love, Mercutio&#x27;s piquant buffooning, the terrible catastrophe, and the solemn oath of the two rival families. One line of text from the review eventually shows up in the libretto of the symphony.

===Realization===

The eventual composition of &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; as we know it now was made possible by the generous gift of 20,000 francs by Niccolò Paganini; after hearing a performance of &quot;Harold en Italie&quot; at the Paris Conservatoire on 16 December 1838, the great virtuoso had publicly knelt before Berlioz and hailed him as the heir of Beethoven. Paganini died shortly after, and did not read or hear the piece. Berlioz used the money primarily to repay his debts, and afterwards was still left with &quot;a handsome sum of money&quot;, which he used to allow himself to put his full focus towards working on &quot;a really important work&quot;, unobstructed by his usual time-consuming obligations as a critic. Berlioz finished the score on 8 September 1839.

The work&#x27;s libretto is not sourced from the original plays, and as a result contains changes from Shakespeare&#x27;s play, both in the version Berlioz worked from, and subsequent cuts he and his librettist made. Berlioz&#x27;s composition was heavily influenced by the play he had seen acted by Charles Kemble and Harriet Smithson in 1827, which had been rewritten by the 18th century actor David Garrick to have Juliet awaken from her deathlike sleep before Romeo&#x27;s death from (a much slower acting) poison. Berlioz enlisted the services of author Emile Deschamps to write the libretto. Between them they also left out the character of the nurse and expanded Shakespeare&#x27;s brief mention of the two families&#x27; reconciliation into a substantial vocal finale.

Berlioz developed a special predilection for the symphony over his career, writing in his memoirs that one movement in particular became a favorite: &quot;If you now ask me which of my pieces I prefer, my answer will be that I share the view of most artists: I prefer the adagio (the Love Scene) in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.&quot;

==Performance==

From composition until the first performance, Berlioz&#x27;s time was occupied with physical arrangements for the premiere: parts were copied, chorus parts lithographed, and rehearsals got underway. The bass-baritone, Adolphe-Louis Alizard (Friar Lawrence), and the &quot;Prologue&quot; chorus, all of whom came from the Paris Opéra, were prepared during the intermissions of performances there. There was much anticipation in Paris prior to the first performance. In the rehearsals, Berlioz pioneered the practice of orchestral sectionals, rehearsing the different sections of the orchestra separately to better prepare them for the challenging piece. This was followed by two full orchestra rehearsals to polish up the details.

It was first performed in three concerts conducted by Berlioz at the Paris Conservatoire with an orchestra of 100 instruments and 101 voices on 24 November, 1 December and 15 December 1839, before capacity audiences that comprised much of the Parisian intelligentsia. One notable audience member was Richard Wagner, who would later note the influence of the symphony on his opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. Reactions to the piece were quite varied, as could be expected for a radical work. However, it was widely acknowledged that Berlioz had scored a major triumph in these first performances; a &quot;tour de force such as only my system of sectional rehearsals could have achieved&quot;. Berlioz comments: &quot;The work as it was then [in 1839] was performed three times at the Conservatoire under my direction and, each time, appeared to be a genuine success. But I felt at once that much would have to be changed, and I went over it carefully and critically from every point of view.&quot; He continued to revise the work, a few instances upon the suggestions of critics, but generally by his own judgement.

A premiere of a later revision (including cuts and changes to the &quot;Prologue&quot;, &quot;Queen Mab Scherzo&quot;, and the &quot;Finale&quot;) was held in Vienna on 2 January 1846, the first performance since 1839 and the first abroad. After hearing a complete performance in Vienna on 26 January 1846, Berlioz took the opportunity to make major revisions before a performance scheduled for the following April in Prague. He accepted advice from several confidants and advisers, rewriting the coda of the &quot;Queen Mab Scherzo&quot;, shortening Friar Laurence&#x27;s narrative at the end, deleting a lengthy second &quot;Prologue&quot; at the beginning of the second half, and introducing musical foreshadowing in the first prologue. The full score was not published until 1847.

Reflecting on the first performances, Berlioz commented in his memoirs:
The work is enormously difficult to perform. It poses problems of every kind, problems inherent in the form and in the style and only to be solved by long and patient rehearsal, impeccably directed. To be well done, it needs first-rate performers—players, singers, conductor—intent on preparing it with as much care as a new opera is prepared in a good opera house, in fact almost as if it were to be performed by heart.
==Instrumentation==
The score calls for:
*piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets, 4 bassoons
*4 horns, 2 cornets, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, bass tuba
*2 pairs of timpani, 2 Tambourines, 2 Triangles, bass drum, cymbals, crotales
*2 harps and strings
*contralto, tenor, bass

==Music==
Structurally and musically, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; is most indebted to Beethoven&#x27;s 9th symphony – not just due to the use of soloists and choir, but in factors such as the weight of the vocal contribution being in the finale, and also in aspects of the orchestration such as the theme of the trombone recitative at the &quot;Introduction&quot;. The roles of Roméo and Juliette are represented by the orchestra, and the narrative aspects by the voices. Berlioz&#x27;s reasoning follows:
If, in the famous garden and cemetery scenes, the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet&#x27;s asides, and Romeo&#x27;s passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons for this are numerous and easy to understand. First, and this reason alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been treated vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression.

The vocal forces are used sparingly throughout, until they are fully deployed in the finale. The exceptional virtuosity deployed in the orchestral writing seems particularly appropriate for the dedicatee of the work, Paganini himself, who was never able to hear it, much to Berlioz&#x27;s regret. Further examples of Berlioz&#x27;s inventiveness are shown in the use of thematic links throughout the piece, somewhat laying the ground for the Wagnerian leitmotif, for example the last solo notes of the oboe which follow Juliet&#x27;s suicide echo a phrase from the earlier funeral procession when she was thought to be dead. Berlioz signed and dated his autograph on 8 September 1839. The final score was dedicated to Paganini.

The stylistic links of the work with Beethoven before (and Wagner after) could not be stronger. From Beethoven, Berlioz learned the very notion of programmatic music. He saw in the Pastoral symphony how music might be depictive without being naïve, in the symphonic scherzi how the delicate &quot;Queen Mab&quot; might best be evoked, and in the 9th symphony how effective a choral finale could be. He sensed Beethoven&#x27;s flexibility with regard to number of movements and the performing force.

==Influence==

From &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; Wagner absorbed much about the ideals of dramatic music and the work can be considered a major influence on &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. When Wagner first heard the work in 1839 he said it made him feel like a schoolboy at Berlioz&#x27;s side. &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; was also the work of Berlioz&#x27;s that Wagner knew best. Indeed, their second and last meeting was on the occasion of a performance of the work in London in 1855. Wagner learned something of melodic flexibility and perhaps even a mastery of the orchestral force from Berlioz. Moreover, in 1860, he sent Berlioz the published full score of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; inscribed merely:

Beyond the influence on Wagner&#x27;s music drama, the piece pushed the limits of the contemporary orchestra&#x27;s capabilities, in terms of colour, programmatic scope and individual virtuosity. While this applies to much of Berlioz&#x27;s music, it is even more true for &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, written at the height of his powers and ambition. Its vivid scene-setting surpasses many operas, which constitutes an enormous success on Berlioz&#x27;s part. Franz Liszt also recognised the significance of Berlioz as a progressive composer, and championed his music.

<text>Sticholonche is a genus of radiolarians with a single species, Sticholonche zanclea, found in open oceans at depths of 99–510 metres. It is generally considered a heliozoan, placed in its own order, called the Taxopodida. However it has also been classified as an unusual radiolarian, and this has gained support from genetic studies, which place it near the Acantharea.

&quot;Sticholonche&quot; are usually around 200 μm, though this varies considerably, and have a bilaterally symmetric shape, somewhat flattened and widened at the front. The axopods are arranged into distinct rows, six of which lie in a dorsal groove and are rigid, and the rest of which are mobile. These are used primarily for buoyancy, rather than feeding. They also have fourteen groups of prominent spines, and many smaller s, although there is no central capsule as in true radiolarians.

<text>Murray House is a Victorian-era building in Stanley, Hong Kong. Built in the present-day business district of Central in 1846 as officers&#x27; quarters of the Murray Barracks, the building was moved to the south of Hong Kong Island during the 2000s. This building has become an iconic landmark in Hong Kong. After housing the Hong Kong Maritime Museum, now in Stanley, it is now home to restaurants and shops.
== Architecture ==
Murray House was one of the oldest surviving public buildings in Hong Kong. Similar to many of its contemporaries from the early colonial era, it was designed in Neoclassical style. The heavy stone walls (with flat arched opening) are on the ground floor to give a sense of stability, while the lighter Doric and Ionic columns are on the floors above to allow better ventilation. All floors have verandas on all sides in response to the local subtropical/monsoons climate.

==History==
===Early history===
Murray House was built in 1846 as officers&#x27; quarters of the Murray Barracks during the early years of British rule. It was named after Sir George Murray, the British Master-General of the Ordnance at the time. The designer and constructor were Major Edward Aldrich and Lieutenant Thomas Bernard Collinson of the Royal Engineers.

===Japanese occupation===
During the 44-month Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the building was used as the command centre by the Japanese military police. It was also the execution place for some Chinese citizens.

===Post-war period===
After World War II, several government departments used the building as offices, including the Rating and Valuation Department, starting in 1965. The building was believed to be haunted and was exorcised twice. One of the exorcism ceremonies was held in 1963, the other one was held in 1974 and was televised. Since it was a government building, the Government granted permission for the exorcism to be performed.

== Move to Stanley ==

In 1982, the historical landmark was dismantled to yield to the new Bank of China Tower. Over 3,000 building blocks were labelled and catalogued for future restoration. In 1990, the Housing Department proposed the resurrection of the building in Stanley. The building was restored in 2001 and reopened in 2002.

Originally classified as a Grade I building, the rebuilt House was not graded, as it was considered that the relocation project had failed to meet the international standard for heritage preservation.

==Hong Kong Maritime Museum==
The Hong Kong Maritime Museum was established on the ground floor of Murray House in 2005, then moved to Pier 8 in Central in February 2013.

<text>Enrique Bátiz Campbell (born May 4, 1942) is a Mexican conductor and concert pianist.

Bátiz began piano studies at age 8 with Francisco Agea. He continued studies 10 years later with György Sándor. After two years at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, he became a student of Adele Marcus at the Juilliard School, where he also studied conducting. In 1964, he made several national tours as a pianist, and in 1965 was a semifinalist in the Marguerite Long International Piano Competition in Paris. From 1967 to 1970, he continued his piano studies in Poland with Zbigniew Drzewiecki, where he also studied orchestral conducting with Stanislaw Wislocki. In 1970, he was a finalist in the Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition in Italy.

A 1967 concert tour featured performances with the Łodz and Szczecin Philharmonics. He returned to Mexico in 1969. His debut as a conductor was in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1969 with the Xalapa Symphony Orchestra. In 1970, he made a series of piano recordings for the Polish and Salzburg Broadcast Companies. In April 1971, he was named director, conductor, and founder of the State of Mexico Symphony Orchestra (OSEM). He continued in the post until 1983. He then was music director of the Mexico City Philharmonic Orchestra from 1983 to 1989. 

Outside of Mexico, in 1984, Bátiz was named guest conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1990, he resumed his directorship of the OSEM, remaining until 2017; Bátiz then stood down as music director, nominally for health reasons related to Parkinson&#x27;s Disease.

He has recorded for such labels as EMI International, ASV Records, Musical Heritage Society, Naxos, Pickwick, and RPO Records. He has made some 145 recordings: 58 with the State of Mexico Symphony, 41 with the Royal Philharmonic, 19 with the Mexico City Philharmonic, 12 with the London Philharmonic, nine with the London Symphony, three with the Philharmonia, two with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, and one with the Orchestra della Toscana. He has recorded the complete nine symphonies by Beethoven, the complete pieces for orchestra by Joaquin Rodrigo, Manuel M. Ponce, and Georges Bizet, and eight volumes of Mexican music. In 1997, Bátiz and the OSEM recorded the six symphonies and other works of Tchaikovsky, the four Brahms symphonies and the four symphonies of Robert Schumann.

Throughout his career, Bátiz has received numerous awards. These include &quot;La primera Presea Bienal&quot; in Art from the State of Mexico Confederation of Professionals, Rome&#x27;s International Gold Mercury award (the first given to a Latin American artist), and the Jose Marti and Tlatelolco&#x27;s Eagle medals. In 1986, Brazil awarded him the Rio Branco medal for making the first digital recording of the nine Bachianas Brasileiras by Heitor Villa-Lobos. The Mexican Union of Theatrical and Musical Broadcasters named him the most distinguished artist of the year four times (1971, 1981, 1983, and 1996). In 1991, he received the Mozart medal given by the Domecq Cultural Institute. In 1995, he won the “State of Mexico” Prize. In 1994, because of his contribution to the musical culture of the State of Mexico and the musical world, he received the Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz award for Arts and Letters. In recognition of his achievements, he has been declared &quot;Mexiquense Destacado&quot;, or “Outstanding Mexican.”

<doc id="325903" wikidata="Q159092" url="?curid=325903" title="Angela Gheorghiu">
<text>Angela Gheorghiu (; ; born 7 September 1965) is a Romanian soprano, especially known for her performances in the operas of Puccini and Verdi, widely recognised by critics and opera lovers as one of the greatest sopranos of all time. 

Embarking her career in 1990, she made her Royal Opera House and Vienna State Opera debuts in 1992, followed by New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera debut in 1993. She was catapulted to international stardom after starring as Violetta in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; at Covent Garden in 1994. Her signature roles include Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot;, Magda in &quot;La rondine&quot;, the title roles in &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;.
She had performed frequently with French tenor Roberto Alagna, whom she first met in 1992 and married in 1996, in concerts and opera productions until their eventual divorce in 2013.

Her voice is described as &quot;...the most instantly recognizable and interesting soprano voice of our time. A liquid instrument of great lyrical beauty with gleaming spun-gold high notes, but a dark, vibrant contralto range, reminiscent of Maria Callas.&quot;, and she is considered &quot;the world&#x27;s most glamorous opera star&quot;.

She has made substantial discography primarily with EMI Classics (absorbed into Warner Classics in 2013) and Decca, and holds several Gramophone Awards and honorary doctorates.

==Early life and family==
Angela Burlacu was born in Adjud, Romania, to a seamstress mother and train driver father. Along with her sister Elena, she sang opera music from an early age. At age 14, she began to study singing at the Ciprian Porumbescu Conservatory, primarily under Mia Barbu. Her graduation in 1990 followed the overthrow of Nicolae Ceaușescu the previous year, enabling her to seek an international career immediately. Her graduation exam took place at the Cluj-Napoca Romanian National Opera as Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot; in 1990, the same year she won third prize in the Belvedere International Singing Competition.

In 1996, Elena died in a car crash. Angela&#x27;s parents then separated and her father became a monk, living in a monastery in Mount Athos. Four years later, after Elena&#x27;s surgeon husband, Andrei Dan, died, Angela adopted their daughter, Ioana, who studied in the University of Kent and has lived in London since. She decided not to have a child of her own in fear of the probable voice change after pregnancy and that raising Ioana was already a satisfying experience for her.

== Career ==
===Early career (1991–2002)===
Gheorghiu made her international debut at the Theater Basel in 1991, performing Adina in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;. In 1992, she debuted at the Royal Opera, London in one performance as Zerlina in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; opposite Bryn Terfel as Masetto, and then her official debut as Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot;. In the same year, she debuted at the Vienna State Opera in the role of Adina, and was engaged as Nannetta in &quot;Falstaff&quot; in the same season. She became a regular guest singer at the Royal Opera, featuring in consecutive seasons in various opera productions such as Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; (Liù), &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (Zerlina), &quot;Carmen&quot; (Micaëla), &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (Adina), &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (Juliette), &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (Antonia). In 1994, she starred in the premiere of a new production of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Chérubin&quot;. In November 1994, she debuted as Violetta in Richard Eyre&#x27;s new production of &quot;La traviata&quot; conducted by Georg Solti at the Royal Opera House. The sensation prompted BBC Two to clear its regular schedule on 8 December to broadcast the live performance, which led her to international stardom.

In 1993, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut in &quot;La bohème&quot;. Since then, she has returned to the company for &quot;La bohème&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;. In 1999, she was featured in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot; as Suzel at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo. She was featured in Michael Jackson&#x27;s MJ &amp; Friends in Munich. Later in the year, she sang at the Richard Tucker Opera Gala, and performed at the reopening of the Covent Garden Royal Opera House. In 2001, she performed in La Fenice&#x27;s reopening concert, &quot;Concert in Honour of the President of the Republic&quot; at the Teatro Malibran.
She also made guest appearances at the Paris Opera (Micaëla, Violetta, Mimì) and Salzburg Festival (Violetta, Juliette).
Gheorghiu was additionally cast in two opera films: &quot;Tosca&quot; (2001; directed by Benoît Jacquot) as the title role, and &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (2002; directed by Barbara Willis Sweete) as Juliette.

She returned to the production in the London revival in 2004, at her San Francisco Opera debut in November 2007, and the Met premiere in the 2008/09 season, which was the company&#x27;s first performance of the opera since 1936.

In 2006, she sang the title role in &quot;Tosca&quot; on stage for the first time in Jonathan Kent&#x27;s new production at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Her performance was an overall success, although because the famous Zeffirelli 1964 production, which was designed for Maria Callas, was replaced, there was comparison between the Toscas of Gheorghiu and Callas.

She gave performances at the Teatro Regio di Torino, Los Angeles Opera, Deutsche Oper Berlin, Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma. In 2007, she made her La Scala opera debut in &quot;La traviata&quot; conducted by Lorin Maazel, and returned five years later for &quot;La bohème&quot;.

She took part in the &quot;Divas in Beijing&quot; concert series held during the 2008 Summer Olympics. In October 2008, she performed at the Memorial Concert for Luciano Pavarotti in Petra, where she also performed an unconventional duet of &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; with Sting.
She then premiered a new &quot;Faust&quot; at the Vienna State Opera. In 2009, she was invited to honor Grace Bumbry at the 32nd Annual Kennedy Center Honors, where she performed &quot;Vissi d&#x27;arte&quot; from Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; in the presence of Barack Obama.

In July 2012, she held her first master class at the Georg Solti Accademia in Castiglione della Pescaia, Italy. She returned for a second master class in 2016. In November 2012 she returned to San Francisco Opera to perform in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;.

In May 2013, she performed the Romanian national anthem &quot;Deșteaptă-te, române!&quot; on the day the flag of Romania entered the Guinness World Records for the &quot;World&#x27;s biggest flag&quot;.
Gheorghiu returned to the Met in December 2014 to perform Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot; to great critical acclaim, opposite Michael Fabiano.

In March 2015, she debuted as Charlotte in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot; at the Vienna State Opera to great critical acclaim, and then repeated the role in August at the Salzburg Festival in a concert performance.

In December, Gheorghiu sang together with Ramón Vargas and Ghiță Petean in a gala concert at Opéra de Monte-Carlo, from which all proceeds went to the &quot;Fondo Memorial Eduardo Vargas&quot;, established in memory of the tenor&#x27;s deceased son.

In 2016, Gheorghiu returned in the title role of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; at the Royal Opera House and received great critical acclaim.

In September 2016, Gheorghiu performed in &quot;Tosca&quot; at the Berlin State Opera with &quot;loud and prolonged ovation&quot;.

==Personal life==

Gheorghiu met tenor Roberto Alagna, her co-star in &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Royal Opera, in 1992. At the time, they were both married; she was married to plumbing engineer Andrei Gheorghiu. In 1994, Alagna&#x27;s wife died of cancer. She divorced in the same year, but retained his surname due to the musical background of the family, with whom she still maintained a good relationship. They were engaged by 1995, and then married during a run of &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in April 1996 in general manager Joseph Volpe&#x27;s office by New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. The couple have sung together often on stage and on studio recordings.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, she spoke of Alagna&#x27;s jealousy of other artists with whom she performed, especially Jonas Kaufmann. In October 2009, Alagna announced their separation in an interview with &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. However, Gheorghiu claimed in an interview with &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; that it was she that filed the divorce and that he wanted to get back together.
Following the separation, she declined to appear opposite Alagna in &quot;Carmen&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in December 2009. The divorce was called off in December 2009.

In a March 2011 interview with the &quot;Daily Express&quot; she stated that she and Alagna were back together, though she still planned to sing separately from him for a while. They were seen together in March 2011 backstage at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House where Alagna was performing in &quot;Aida&quot;. Later that year, they jointly opened the amphitheatre in the Katara Cultural Village, Qatar. In June 2012, they sang together in two performances of &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Royal Opera House to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their meeting in a production of the same. They also sang at a joint concert in Buenos Aires, and had planned to perform together in &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; and &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; in future seasons. However, in January 2013, they agreed to divorce.

She has been in a relationship with Romanian dentist Mihai Ciortea, who is 22 years her junior, since autumn 2013.

==Professional relationships==
On rare occasion, Gheorghiu has had difficult relationships with opera house managements and directors. Some, but not all, of them have stemmed from her opposition to directors who, as she put it in an interview with &quot;ABC&quot; &quot;want to express their own fantasies, forgetting about the characters. At times, she says, what they put on stage goes against both the story and the music.&quot; She has attributed her outspokenness to her upbringing in Romania under the totalitarian regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu:
Because I grew up in a country where there was no possibility of having an opinion, it makes me stronger now. Lots of singers are frightened about not getting invited back to an opera house if they speak out. But I have the courage to be, in a way, revolutionary. I want to fight for opera, for it to be taken seriously. Pop music is for the body, but opera is for the soul.

In 1996, Gheorghiu was cast as Micaëla in a new production of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, opposite Waltraud Meier and Plácido Domingo at the Metropolitan Opera. The production by Franco Zeffirelli called for the role to wear a blonde wig, which she disliked. When the Met toured the production in Japan in 1997, she refused to wear it on the first night to which then general manager Joseph Volpe said, &quot;The wig is going on, with you or without you&quot; and replaced her with an understudy. She then resumed the performances with the wig entirely covered by the hood of her cape.

Volpe had planned to engage Gheorghiu in the role of Violetta Valery for a new production of &quot;La traviata&quot;, to premiere in November 1998 and directed by Zeffirelli. Alagna was to sing the role of Violetta&#x27;s lover, Alfredo Germont. According to Volpe, Gheorghiu and Alagna argued with the staff and the director over production details and continually delayed signing the contract. They eventually signed their contracts, and faxed them to the Met one day past their deadline. Volpe refused to accept them. The production opened with Patricia Racette and Marcelo Álvarez as the lovers.

In September 2007, Gheorghiu was dismissed from Lyric Opera of Chicago&#x27;s production of &quot;La bohème&quot; by General Manager William Mason, for missing rehearsals and costume fittings, and generally &quot;unprofessional&quot; behavior. Gheorghiu said in a statement that she had missed some rehearsals to spend time with her husband, who was singing at the Met in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; and rehearsing for Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and added, &quot;I have sung &quot;Bohème&quot; hundreds of times, and thought missing a few rehearsals wouldn&#x27;t be a tragedy. It was impossible to do the costume fitting at the same time I was in New York.&quot;

Asked once if she was difficult, she replied: &quot;No, I seek perfection!&quot;

<text>The Nart sagas (Abkhaz: Нарҭаа ражәабжьқәа; &quot;Nartaa raƶuabƶkua&quot;; ; ) are a series of tales originating from the North Caucasus. They form much of the basic mythology of the ethnic groups in the area, including Abazin, Abkhaz, Circassian, Ossetian, Karachay-Balkar, and to some extent Chechen-Ingush folklore.
==Etymology==
The term &quot;nart&quot; comes from the Ossetian &quot;Nartæ&quot;, which is &quot;plurale tantum&quot; of &quot;nar&quot;. The derivation of the root &quot;nar&quot; is of Iranian origin, from Proto-Iranian &quot;*nar&quot; for &#x27;hero, man&#x27;, descended from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;. In Ingush and Chechen, the word &quot;nart&quot; means &#x27;giant&#x27;.

== Characters ==
Some of the characters who feature prominently in the sagas are:

* Sosruko or Soslan (Ubykh, Abkhaz and Adyghe: &quot;sawsərəqʷa&quot; (Саусырыкъо); Ossetian: &quot;Soslan&quot; (Сослан)) – a hero who sometimes also appears as a trickster
* Batraz (Ossetian: Батырадз) – the leader and greatest warrior of the Narts
* Satanaya (Ubykh: &quot;satanaja&quot;; Adyghe: &quot;Setenej&quot; (Сэтэнай); Ossetian: &quot;Satana&quot; (Сатана)) – the mother of the Narts, a fertility figure and matriarch
* Tlepsh (Adyghe and Abaza: &quot;&quot;; Ossetian: &quot;Kwyrdalægon&quot; (Куырдалæгон)) – a blacksmith deity
* Syrdon (Ossetian: Сырдон) – a trickster figure compared by Georges Dumezil to the Norse god Loki (see :ru:Сырдон)
* Pkharmat (Chechen: &quot;Pẋarmat&quot; (Пхьармат)) – in the Nakh peoples&#x27; Vainakh epos, a blacksmith figure who steals fire from the gods for the mortals
* Akhsar and Akhsartag (Ossetian: &quot;Æхсæр&quot;, &quot;Æхсæртæг&quot;) are twin brothers who are heroes in Ossetian mythology and sons of Warhag. Akhsartag is also the father of the narts Uryzmaeg and Haemyts.
* Dzerassae (Ossetian: Дзерассæ) – daughter of the sea-god Donbettyr, and mother of many Nart heroes.
* Uryzmaeg (Ossetian: &quot;Уырызмæг,&quot; &quot;Орæзмæг, Урузмæг,&quot; Adyghe: &quot;Орзэмэдж/Озырмэс,&quot; Kabardian: &quot;Уэзырмэс,&quot; Chechen: Орзми, Ingush: &quot;Урузман,&quot; Abkhazian/Abaza&quot;: Уазырмас,&quot; Karachay-Balkar: &quot;Ёрюзмек&quot;) is the hero of the Nart saga, son of Akhsartag and Dzerassae.
* Haemyts (Ossetian: &quot;Хæмыц,&quot; Adyghe: &quot;Хъымыщ,&quot; Kabardian: &quot;Хъымыщ,&quot; Chechen: &quot;Хамчи,&quot; Ingush: &quot;Хамча,&quot; Abkhazian: &quot;Хмышь,&quot; Abaza&quot;: Хъмыщ,&quot; Karachay-Balkar: &quot;Хымыч&quot;) is the hero of the, son of Akhsartag and Dzerassae, the father of the hero Batraz and the twin brother of Uruzmaeg, with whom they often went on conquest campaigns together.

== Study and significance ==
The first Westerner to take note of the Nart stories was the German scholar Julius von Klaproth, who traveled to the Caucasus during the first decade of the 19th century. The earliest written account of the material is attributed to the Kabardian author Shora Begmurzin Nogma, who wrote in Russian in 1835–1843, published posthumously in 1861. A German translation by Adolf Berge was published in 1866 . The stories exist in the form of prose tales as well as epic songs.

It is generally known that some of the Nart corpora have an ancient Iranian core, inherited from the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans (the latter being the ancestors of the Ossetians). However, they also contain abundant local North Caucasian accretions of great antiquity, which sometimes reflect an even more archaic past.

The Ossetes consider the Nart epic to be a central feature of their national identity. Based especially on the Ossetian versions, the Nart stories have been valued by scholars as a window towards the world of the Iranian-speaking cultures of antiquity, and as an important source for comparative Indo-European mythology. For example, the philologist Georges Dumézil used the Ossetian division of the Narts into three clans to support his &quot;Trifunctional Hypothesis&quot; that the Proto-Indo-Europeans were similarly divided into three castes—warriors, priests, and commoners.

The Northwest Caucasian (Circassian, Abkhaz-Abasin and Ubykh) versions are also highly valuable because they contain more archaic accretions and preserve &quot;all the odd details constituting the detritus of earlier traditions and beliefs&quot;, as opposed to the Ossetian ones, which have been &quot;reworked to form a smooth narrative&quot;.

==Connections to other mythology==
Some motifs in the Nart sagas are shared by Greek mythology. The story of Prometheus chained to Mount Kazbek or to Mount Elbrus in particular is similar to an element in the Nart sagas. These shared motifs are seen by some as indicative of an earlier proximity of the Caucasian peoples to the ancient Greeks, also shown in the myth of the Golden Fleece, in which Colchis is generally accepted to have been part of modern-day Georgia.

In the book &quot;From Scythia to Camelot&quot;, authors C. Scott Littleton and Linda A. Malcor speculate that many aspects of the Arthurian legends are derived from the Nart sagas. The proposed vector of transmission is the Alans, some of whom migrated into northern France at around the time the Arthurian legends were forming. As expected, these parallels are most evident in the Ossetian versions, according to researcher John Colarusso. For more details, see &quot;Historicity of King Arthur – Lucius Artorius Castus and the Sarmatian connection.&quot;

== Differences between Nart legends ==
There are some differences between the various versions of the Nart legends. For example, the Ossetian versions depict the Nartic tribe as composed of three distinct clans that sometimes rival one another: the brave Æxsærtægkatæ (to whom the most prominent Narts belong), the rich Borætæ, and the wise Alægatæ; the Circassian versions do not depict such a division. The Abkhaz versions are unique in describing the Narts as a single nuclear family composed of Satanaya&#x27;s one hundred sons. All of these versions describe the Narts as a single coherent group of (mostly) &quot;good&quot; heroes.

Some Nakh (Chechen-Ingush) legends include a group called the &quot;Nart-Orxustxoi&quot;, which includes the most prominent Narts known from the other versions (e.g. Seska-Solsa corresponding to Sosruko/Soslan, Khamtsha-Patarish corresponding to Batraz/Batradz, etc.) In contrast to the Ossetian and Abkhaz versions, the Nakh legends depict the Narts as warlike bandits who fight against local good heroes such as Koloi-Kant and Qinda-Shoa (with Qinda-Shoa corresponding to Sawway/Shawey). 

Shayan Javadi, the Persian translator of &quot;Nart&quot; by matching the Ossetian, Abkhaz, Abaza, Circassian, and Ubykh versions, has been able to identify the lineage of some characters who have only been named. For instance, by recreating a character named &quot;Qânzezâd (Abaza: Qanzhoquo),&quot; he believes that he is the son of Azaukhan in the Ossetian version.

<text>Mercury Records is an American record label owned by Universal Music Group. It had significant success as an independent operation in the 1940s and 1950s. Smash Records and Fontana Records were sub labels of Mercury. Mercury Records released rock, funk, R&amp;B, doo wop, soul music, blues, pop, rock and roll, and jazz records. In the United States, it is operated through Republic Records; in the United Kingdom and Japan (as Mercury Tokyo in the latter country), it is distributed by EMI Records.

Since the separation of Island Records, Motown, Mercury Records, and Def Jam Recordings combining the Island Def Jam Music Group, Mercury Records has been placed under Island Records, although its back catalogue is still owned by the Island Def Jam Music Group (now Island Records).

==Background==
Mercury Records was started in Chicago in 1945 and over several decades, saw great success. The success of Mercury has been attributed to the use of alternative marketing techniques to promote records. The conventional method of record promotion used by major labels such as RCA Victor, Decca Records, and Capitol Records was dependent on radio airplay, but Mercury Records co-founder Irving Green decided to promote new records using jukeboxes instead. By lowering promotion costs, Mercury was able to compete with the more established record labels, and thus became an established record label itself.

===Beginnings===
Mercury Record Corporation was formed in Chicago in 1945 by Irving Green, Berle Adams, Ray Greenberg, and Arthur Talmadge. The company was a major force in R&amp;B, doo wop, soul music, pop doo wop, pop soul, blues, pop, rock and roll, jazz and classical music. Early in the label&#x27;s history, Mercury opened two pressing plants, one in Chicago and the other in St. Louis, Missouri. By hiring two promoters, Tiny Hill and Jimmy Hilliard, they penetrated the pop market with names such as Frankie Laine, Vic Damone, Tony Fontane, and Patti Page.

In 1946, Mercury hired Eddie Gaedel, an American with dwarfism, most notable for participating in a Major League Baseball game, to portray the &quot;Mercury Man&quot;, complete with a winged hat similar to its logo, to promote Mercury recordings. Some early Mercury recordings featured a caricature of him as their logo.

In 1947, Jack Rael, a musician and publicist/manager, persuaded Mercury to let Patti Page (whom he managed) record a song that had been planned to be done by Vic Damone, &quot;Confess&quot;. The budget was too small for them to hire a second singer to provide the &quot;answer&quot; parts to Page, so at Rael&#x27;s suggestion, she did both voices. Though &quot;overdubbing&quot; had been used occasionally on 78-rpm discs in the 1930s, for Lawrence Tibbett recordings, among others, this became the first documented example of &quot;overdubbing&quot; using tape.

The company released an enormous number of recordings under the Mercury label, as well as its subsidiaries (Blue Rock Records, Cumberland Records, EmArcy Records, Smash Records, and Wing Records, later via Fontana Records and Limelight Records after being absorbed by Philips). In addition, they leased and purchased material by independent labels and redistributed them. Under their own label, Mercury released a variety of recording styles from classical music to psychedelic rock. Its subsidiaries, though, focused on their own specialized categories of music.

===Mercury&#x27;s jazz division===
From 1947 to 1952, John Hammond was a vice-president of Mercury Records. Mercury, under its EmArcy label, released LPs by many post-swing and bebop artists, including Clifford Brown and Max Roach, Kenny Drew, Dinah Washington, Nat Adderley, Cannonball Adderley, Ernestine Anderson, Sarah Vaughan, Maynard Ferguson, Walter Benton, Herb Geller.

In the late 1950s, Mercury released jazz recordings of multiple artists, including Max Roach, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Dizzy Gillespie, and Buddy Rich. During the 1960s albums were released by artists including Gene Ammons, Quincy Jones, Buddy Rich, Cannonball Adderley, Dinah Washington, Max Roach, Paul Bley and Jimmy Smith.
===Later history: 1950s–present===

During the 1950s, Mercury released hits of musicians such as the Platters, Brook Benton, the Diamonds, and Patti Page.
In 1961, Philips, a Dutch electronics company and owner of Philips Records, which had lost its distribution deal with Columbia Records outside North America, played a key role in Mercury&#x27;s future by signing an exchange agreement with the American record company. A year later, Mercury was sold to Consolidated Electronics Industries Corp. (Conelco), which was an affiliate of Philips under its U.S. Trust division; in 1963, Mercury switched British distribution from EMI to Philips. In 1962, Mercury began marketing a line of phonographs made by Philips bearing the Mercury brand name.

In July 1967, Mercury Records became the first U.S. record label to release cassette music tapes (Musicassettes). In 1969, Mercury changed its corporate name to Mercury Record Productions Inc., while its parent Conelco became North American Philips Corp. (NAPC) after Philips bought control of the company.

Philips and German electronics giant Siemens reorganized their joint-ventured record operations, Grammophon-Philips Group, home of Deutsche Grammophon, Philips Records, and Polydor to become PolyGram in 1972. That year, PolyGram bought Mercury from NAPC. Mercury&#x27;s corporate name was changed to Phonogram Inc. to match a related company in the UK that operated the Mercury label there. During the 1970s, Mercury released hits by musicians such as The Statler Brothers, Paper Lace, Rod Stewart, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Cledus Maggard and The Citizen&#x27;s Band, Jacky Ward, Glenn Sutton,William Bell, Rush, The Brains and Reba McEntire.

From late 1974 to early 1983, the company&#x27;s label design featured a painting of three famous buildings that are located in Chicago: Marina City, John Hancock Center, and One IBM Plaza, the latter which was Mercury&#x27;s headquarters during that period, having moved from its long-time address at 35 East Wacker Drive. Mercury released soul musicians such as the Dells and Marvin Sease. From the 1970s through the early 1980s, Mercury released albums of funk musicians such as Ohio Players, the Bar-Kays, Con Funk Shun, and Hamilton Bohannon. Mercury released albums by Kool &amp; the Gang (following the dissolution of De-Lite Records in 1985), the first three albums of the 1979-86 self titled series of the Gap Band (via Total Experience Productions) and Cameo (via distribution of leader Larry Blackmon&#x27;s label Atlanta Artists Records). And the label released early rapper Kurtis Blow&#x27;s hit &quot;The Breaks&quot; (1980) also. Mercury released blues musician Robert Cray.

In 1980, Phonogram moved its headquarters from Chicago to New York City. In 1981, Mercury, along with other U.S. PolyGram-owned labels, which included Polydor, RSO Records, and Casablanca, consolidated under the new name PolyGram Records, Inc. (now UMG Recordings). Under PolyGram, Mercury absorbed the artists and catalogue of Casablanca Records (also home to the 20th Century Records back catalogue), which consisted of hard rockers Kiss and disco stars Donna Summer and the Village People, and primarily became a rock/pop/new wave label with Van Morrison, Thin Lizzy, All About Eve, Julian Cope, Scorpions, Rush, John Cougar Mellencamp, Big Country, Tears for Fears, Bon Jovi, Cinderella, and Def Leppard as well as the Oklahoma-based three-piece Hanson.

Mercury, by having Thin Lizzy, Bon Jovi, Cinderella, Def Leppard, Kiss, the Scorpions, and various other rock acts on their roster, became a premiere label for hard rock music. Most of these bands were on Vertigo Records in Europe (that label specialized in progressive rock and hard rock including subgenres like glam metal).

In late 1998, PolyGram was bought by Seagram, which then absorbed the company into its Universal Music Group unit. Under the reorganization, Mercury Records was closed and folded into the newly formed The Island Def Jam Music Group (IDJMG). Mercury&#x27;s pop roster was predominantly taken over by Island Records, while its hip-hop acts found a new home at Def Jam Recordings, and some of Mercury&#x27;s R&amp;B acts were moved to the newly created Def Soul Records. Mercury&#x27;s former country unit became Mercury Nashville Records. However, Mercury Records was relaunched in 2007 as a label under The Island Def Jam Music Group, appointing record executive David Massey as the President and CEO of the new venture. The label was defunct in 2015.
On April 11, 2022, Republic Records announced that they had acquired Mercury Records, and it will continue as their imprint.

The Mercury name also survives on the Mercury Records division of UMG France, the Mercury Studios film division (which absorbed Eagle Rock Entertainment, acquired by UMG in 2014), the classical music label Mercury KX, and catalogue reissues in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Brazil, as well.

In 2024, Mercury Records became part of Universal Music Group-owned Republic Corps, joining sister labels Republic Records, Island Records, Casablanca Records and Def Jam Recordings.

==Mercury Living Presence series==
In 1951, under the direction of recording engineer C. Robert (Bob) Fine and recording director David Hall, Mercury Records initiated a recording technique using a single microphone to record symphony orchestras. Fine had for several years used a single microphone for Mercury small-ensemble classical recordings produced by John Hammond and later Mitch Miller (indeed, Miller, using his full name of Mitchell Miller, made several recordings as a featured oboe player in the late 1940s for Mercury). The first record in this new Mercury Olympian Series was &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; performed by Rafael Kubelík and the Chicago Symphony. The group that became the best known using this technique was the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, which, under the leadership of conductor Antal Doráti, made a series of classical albums that were well reviewed and sold briskly, including the first-ever complete recordings of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballets &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. Dorati&#x27;s 1954 one-microphone monaural recording (Mercury MG 50054) and 1958 three-microphone stereo rerecording (Mercury MG 50054) of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot; included dramatic overdub recordings of 1812-era artillery and the bells of the Yale University Carillon. A stereo release in 1960 featured new recordings of the cannon shots, and the bells of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon at the Riverside Church in Chicago. Besides Mercury&#x27;s mono and stereo versions of the &quot;1812&quot;, only one other classical album rang up gold-record sales in the 1950s in the U.S.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Howard Taubman described the Mercury sound on &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; as &quot;being in the living presence of the orchestra&quot; and Mercury eventually began releasing their classical recordings under the &#x27;Living Presence&#x27; series&#x27; name. The recordings were produced by Mercury vice president Wilma Cozart, who later married Bob Fine. Cozart took over recording director duties in 1953 and also produced the CD reissues of more than half of the Mercury Living Presence catalog in the 1990s. By the late 1950s, the Mercury Living Presence crew included session musical supervisors Harold Lawrence and Clair van Ausdall and associate engineer Robert Eberenz.

Besides the recordings with the Chicago and Minneapolis orchestras, Mercury also recorded Howard Hanson with the Eastman Rochester Orchestra, Frederick Fennell with the Eastman Wind Ensemble, and Paul Paray with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.

In late 1955, Mercury began using three omnidirectional microphones to make stereo recordings on three-track tape. The technique was an expansion on the mono process—center was still paramount. Once the center, single microphone was set, the sides were set to provide the depth and width heard in the stereo recordings. The center microphone still fed the mono LP releases, which accompanied stereo LPs well into the 1960s. From 1961, Mercury enhanced the three-microphone stereo technique by using 35-mm magnetic film instead of half-inch tape for recording. The greater emulsion thickness, track width, and speed (90 ft/min or 18 in/sec) of 35-mm magnetic film increased prevention of tape layer print-through and gained in addition extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury &#x27;Living Presence&#x27; stereo records were mastered directly from the three-track tapes or magnetic film, with a 3-2 mix occurring in the mastering room. The same technique—and restored vintage equipment of the same type—was used during the CD reissues. Specifically, three-track tapes were recorded on Ampex 300-3 (½-in, three-track) machines at 15 in/sec. The 35-mm magnetic film recordings were made on three-track Westrex film recorders. The 3-2 mixdown was done on a modified Westrex mixer. For the original LPs, the mixer directly fed the custom cutting chain. At Fine Recording in New York City, the Westrex cutter head on a Scully lathe was fed by modified McIntosh 200W tube amplifiers with very little feedback in the system. Older mono records were made with a Miller cutter head. 

The original LP releases of the classical recordings continued through 1968. The Mercury classical-music catalogue (including the Living Presence catalogue) is currently managed by Decca Label Group through Philips Records, which reissued the recordings on LP and then CD. In turn, Mercury now manages the pop/rock catalog of Philips Records.
In 2012, Decca Classics, the current owner of the Mercury Living Presence label, issued a value-priced 51-CD box that included 50 of the 1990s CD titles (remastered by Wilma Cozart Fine), a bonus CD containing an interview with Wilma Cozart Fine, and a deluxe booklet detailing the history of Mercury Living Presence. The CD set was issued worldwide and was sold by major retailers. A limited-edition six-LP box set was also issued. The CD set brings back into print dozens of titles that had not been available as manufactured CDs since the early 2000s.

In 2013, Decca Classics issued a second, 55-CD box set, along with a second six-LP box set. The CD box set included two bonus discs: a new reissue of the 1953 monophonic recording of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; by Dorati with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, and a first-time-on-CD reissue of the premiere recording of John Corigliano&#x27;s Piano Concerto, played by Hilde Somer with the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Victor Alessandro.

On January 4, 2015, Mercury co-founder Irwin Steinberg died at the age of 94.

==Major Mercury Records labels and operations worldwide==

This division of Mercury handled US distribution of most pre-1998 Polydor Records pop/rock releases currently under UMG control. Some exceptions remain, however. Some artists based outside the US did not have their releases on Polydor in North America, signing to various other labels, instead. Some of these bands, such as The Who, did sign to a label that also is now part of the UMG family (or later absorbed by such a label), hence those labels control US rights to these works (in the case of The Who, they had been on US Decca Records and MCA Records in the past, their prebreakup catalogue is now on Geffen Records in North America).

===Mercury KX (formerly )===

Mercury Classics was relaunched in 2012 as an international classical label by UMGI, appointing musicologist and record executive Dr. Alexander Buhr as managing director. The label aims to identify and work with strong creative individuals who bring a distinctive and fresh perspective to classical music.

In its first year, artist signings to the label included Icelandic neoclassical composer Olafur Arnalds, New York-based string quartet Brooklyn Rider, Chinese pianist Yundi, and Austrian clarinetist and Berlin Philharmonic soloist Andreas Ottensamer. The label also oversees the recording career of Montenegrin classical guitarist Milos Karadaglic, and has an ongoing partnership with Tori Amos, which dates back to her work with Buhr on her classically inspired &quot;Night of Hunters&quot; album for Deutsche Grammophon in 2011. Following Buhr&#x27;s longstanding relationship with the Deutsche Grammophon label, some of Mercury Classics&#x27; early core classical recordings were rereleased under the aegis of sister company Deutsche Grammophon.

In 2013, Mercury Classics released Olafur Arnalds&#x27; label debut &quot;For Now I Am Winter&quot;, which entered the US Classical Chart at number one. It was followed by an EP of Arnalds&#x27; soundtrack of the ITV crime series &quot;Broadchurch&quot;, which received a BAFTA Award for best original soundtrack the following year. Yundi&#x27;s recording of three Beethoven sonatas went platinum in his native China. The label also released Andreas Ottensamer&#x27;s debut &quot;Portraits&quot;, and the label debut of Brooklyn Rider &quot;A Walking Fire&quot;. Milos Karadaglic&#x27;s &quot;Latino Gold&quot; topped the UK classical charts and entered the pop charts. Banjo soloist and 15-time Grammy Award winner Bela Fleck&#x27;s concerto for banjo and orchestra &quot;The Impostor&quot; was released in the fall.

In 2014, Mercury Classics released &quot;Aranjuez&quot;, Milos Karadaglic&#x27;s recording of iconic guitar concertos by Joaquin Rodrigo, featuring Yannick Nézet-Séguin and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The album topped the iTunes Classical charts in more than 10 countries and the classical charts in the US, UK, France, New Zealand, and Denmark, where it peaked in the pop charts at number 17. With the release of Yundi&#x27;s new album &quot;Emperor/Fantasy&quot;, including Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Piano Concerto with Berlin Philharmonic and Daniel Harding, Mercury Classics held the top two spots on the UK classical chart. In May 2014, the label released Tori Amos&#x27; 14th studio album &quot;Unrepentant Geraldines&quot;. The album entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; top 200 at number seven, charted in UK (number 13), Netherlands (number 10), and Germany (number 15), and hit the iTunes top 10 in more than 20 countries.

Influential classical music website Alto Riot named Mercury Classics its Label of the Year 2013.

In 2016, Mercury Classics became Mercury KX and changed its focus to post-classical music

===Mercury Nashville===
Mercury&#x27;s Nashville unit dates back to 1957, when Mercury formed a joint venture with Starday Records specifically for releasing artists performing country music. Mercury bought out Starday&#x27;s half in 1958.

In 1997, PolyGram, looking to cut costs in anticipation of a merger with a competitor, consolidated all of its Nashville operations under the Mercury name. Mercury Nashville took over management of all of PolyGram&#x27;s country back catalog from sister labels such as Polydor (including releases once issued by MGM Records), A&amp;M, and the small country back catalog of Motown Records (Motown released these albums under subsidiary labels). All country artists under contract to other PolyGram labels either moved to Mercury or were dropped altogether.

Today, Mercury Nashville continues to be an active imprint under Universal Music Group Nashville, where it continues to manage the country back catalog that once belonged to PolyGram (MCA Nashville manages what Universal had already owned at the time of the PolyGram merger).

===Mercury Records (UK)===
In 1958, Mercury switched its distribution in the UK from Pye to EMI, and in 1964 to Philips.

Mercury operated as an imprint in the UK under Phonogram, a division of Dutch electronics company Philips from the mid-1960s until 1998, when Phonogram was bought by Universal Music. In March 2013, its artist roster was moved to Virgin EMI in a restructuring of Universal&#x27;s UK labels.

In 2005, Jason Iley was appointed the new managing director of Mercury. He joined the company from Island Records, where he was general manager. In July 2005, Iley appointed Paul Adam to senior artist and repertoire (A&amp;R) director of the label; the two had previously worked together at Island Records.

In October 2006, U2 decided to leave Island Records and moved to Mercury Records, reportedly to rejoin Iley, with whom they had worked previously at Island Records.

In March 2011, the label announced it was stopping the production of CD and vinyl singles, and would only release them physically as &quot;rare exceptions&quot;.

In 2012, signings on Mercury included Pixie Lott, Arcade Fire, Amy Macdonald, Noah and the Whale, Chase &amp; Status, Jake Bugg, and Bo Bruce.

In July, Mercury announced that Mike Smith was joining as president of its music division.

In March 2013, Mercury UK was absorbed into Virgin EMI by Universal Music. Virgin EMI was rebranded as EMI Records in June 2020.

===Mercury Records (Australia)===
Launched in 1955 exclusively as a full-service local (Australian) A&amp;R operation. Mercury Records first known Australian artist was Keith Potger in 1968, but the label was put into hibernation in 1999 in favour of the Universal label until 2007–2013. Some successful Australian artists on Mercury included: INXS, Kamahl, Bullamakanka, Darren Hayes, Carl Riseley, The Preatures, Tiddas, Dragon, Teen Queens, Melissa Tkautz and Karise Eden.

===Mercury Records (France)===
In France, Mercury Records operates as a part of the Mercury Music Group, a division of Universal Music Group, which Group controls the French operations of UMG labels Mercury, Fontana Records, Verve Records, Decca Records, Blue Note Records, Island Records, and Virgin Records, among others.

Various other national Universal Music Group companies are known to actively use the Mercury Records trademark as an imprint for their local A&amp;R operations, but no other Universal Music Group companies use the label as a key marketing differentiator, nor do they operate frontline divisions based on the Mercury label.

===Mercury Tokyo (formerly Mercury Music Entertainment, Nippon Phonogram and Kitty MME)===
The Mercury label was first launched in Japan in 1952, by Taihei Onkyo. The company&#x27;s name was later changed to Nippon Mercury in 1953, however, the Mercury label started to be handled by King Records in 1957, and later by Nippon Victor.

It was relaunched in 1970 by Nippon Victor and Matsushita Corporation, as Nippon Phonogram. It operated several Phonogram labels in Japan. In 1993, it became a division of PolyGram K.K. (now Universal Music Japan). In 1995, it was relaunched as Mercury Music Entertainment. It later merged with Kitty Records in 2000 and became Kitty MME. Half of it was merged into the Universal J label in 2002, the other half became known as Universal Sigma in 2004. Its artist roster included Seiko Matsuda, Yūji Oda, Delta, ZIGGY, Kinniku Shōjo Tai, and Takashi Sorimachi.

After 13 years, the label was revitalized under its new name, Mercury Tokyo, under the Universal Music Group and Brands (UMG and Brands) division of Universal Music Japan. K-pop group Monsta X is the first artist or group signed under the newly relaunched label. As of 2022, the label, currently operating under UMJ&#x27;s EMI Records division, has added K-pop groups Drippin, Golden Child, Loona, and STAYC on its roster.

<doc id="325917" wikidata="Q742971" url="?curid=325917" title="John Bull">
<text>John Bull is a national personification of the United Kingdom, especially in political cartoons and similar graphic works. He is usually depicted as a stout, middle-aged, country-dwelling, jolly and matter-of-fact man. He originated in satirical works of the early 18th century and would come to stand for English liberty in opposition to revolutionaries. He was popular through the 18th and 19th centuries until the time of the First World War, when he generally stopped being seen as representative of the &quot;common man&quot;.

==Origin==

John Bull originated as a satirical character created by John Arbuthnot, a friend of Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. Bull first appeared in 1712 in Arbuthnot&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Law is a Bottomless Pit&quot;. The same year Arbuthnot published a four-part political narrative &quot;The History of John Bull&quot;. In this satirical treatment of the War of the Spanish Succession, John Bull brings a lawsuit against various figures intended to represent the kings of France (Louis Baboon) and Spain (Lord Strutt), as well as institutions both foreign and domestic. The allegory was intended primarily as attack against the Whigs, their foreign policy and their financiers who were profiting from the war. In Arbuthnot&#x27;s work John Bull personifies England while his sister Peg symbolises his native Scotland.

William Hogarth and other British writers made Bull, originally derided, &quot;a heroic archetype of the freeborn Englishman.&quot; Later, the figure of Bull was disseminated overseas by illustrators and writers such as American cartoonist Thomas Nast and Irish writer George Bernard Shaw, author of &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot;.

Starting in the 1760s, Bull was portrayed as an Anglo-Saxon country dweller. He was almost always depicted in a buff-coloured waistcoat and a simple frock coat (in the past Navy blue, but more recently with the Union Jack colours). Britannia, or a lion, is sometimes used as an alternative in some editorial cartoons.

As a literary figure, John Bull is well-intentioned, frustrated, full of common sense, and entirely of native country stock. Unlike Uncle Sam later, he is not a figure of authority but rather a yeoman who prefers his small beer and domestic peace, possessed of neither patriarchal power nor heroic defiance. John Arbuthnot provided him with a sister named Peg (Scotland), and a traditional adversary in Louis Baboon (the House of Bourbon in France). Peg continued in pictorial art beyond the 18th century, but the other figures associated with the original tableau dropped away. John Bull himself continued to frequently appear as a national symbol in posters and cartoons as late as World War I.

==Depiction==
Bull is usually depicted as a stout man in a tailcoat with light-coloured breeches and a top hat which, by its shallow crown, indicates its middle-class identity. During the Georgian period his waistcoat is red and/or his tailcoat is royal blue which, together with his buff or white breeches, can thus refer to a greater or lesser extent to the &quot;blue and buff&quot; scheme; this was used by supporters of Whig politics, which was part of what John Arbuthnot wished to deride when he created and designed the character. By the twentieth century, however, his waistcoat nearly always depicts a Union Flag, and his coat is generally dark blue. (Otherwise, however, his clothing still echoes the fashions of the Regency period.) He wears a low topper (sometimes called a John Bull topper) and is often accompanied by a bulldog. John Bull has been used in a variety of different ad campaigns over the years, and is a common sight in British editorial cartoons of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Singer David Bowie wore a coat in the style of Bull.

Washington Irving described him in his chapter entitled &quot;John Bull&quot; from &quot;The Sketch Book:&quot;
The cartoon image of stolid, stocky, conservative and well-meaning John Bull, dressed like an English country squire, sometimes explicitly contrasted with the conventionalised scrawny, French revolutionary &quot;sans-culottes&quot; Jacobin, was developed from about 1790 by British satirical artists James Gillray, Thomas Rowlandson and Isaac Cruikshank. (An earlier national personification was Sir Roger de Coverley, from a 1711 edition of &quot;The Spectator.&quot;)

A more negative portrayal of John Bull occurred in the cartoons drawn by the Egyptian nationalist journalist Yaqub Sanu in his popular underground newspaper &quot;Abu-Naddara Zarqa&quot; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Sanu&#x27;s cartoons depicted John Bull as a coarse, ignorant drunken bully who pushed around ordinary Egyptians while stealing all the wealth of Egypt. Much of Sanu&#x27;s humor revolved around John Bull&#x27;s alcoholism, his crass rudeness, his ignorance about practically everything except alcohol, and his inability to properly speak French (the language of the Egyptian elite), which he hilariously mangled unlike the Egyptian characters who spoke proper French.  
Likewise, the musician, playwright and Irish Republican Dominic Behan criticized the British government via the proxy of John Bull in his popular ballad, The Patriot Game:This Ireland of mine has for long been half free,

Six counties are under John Bull&#x27;s tyranny.

And still de Valera is greatly to blame

For shirking his part in the patriot game.Increasingly through the early twentieth century, John Bull became seen as not particularly representative of &quot;the common man,&quot; and during the First World War this function was largely taken over by the figure of Tommy Atkins. According to Alison Light, during the interwar years the nation abandoned &quot;formerly heroic...public rhetorics of national destiny&quot; in favour of &quot;an Englishness at once less imperial and more inward-looking, more domestic and more private&quot;. Consequently, John Bull was replaced by Sidney Strube&#x27;s suburban Little Man as the personification of the nation. Some saw John Bull&#x27;s replacement by the Little Man as symbolic of Britain&#x27;s post-First World War decline; W. H. Auden&#x27;s 1937 poem &quot;Letter to Lord Byron&quot; favourably contrasted John Bull to the Little Man. Auden wrote:

John Bull&#x27;s surname is also reminiscent of the alleged fondness of the English for beef, reflected in the French nickname for English people, &quot;les rosbifs,&quot; which translates as &quot;the &#x27;Roast Beefs.&#x27;&quot; It is also reminiscent of the animal, and for that reason Bull is portrayed as &quot;virile, strong, and stubborn,&quot; like a bull.

A typical John Bull Englishman is referenced in Margaret Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Summer on the Lakes, in 1843&quot; in Chapter 2: &quot;Murray&#x27;s travels I read, and was charmed by their accuracy and clear broad tone. He is the only Englishman that seems to have traversed these regions, as man, simply, not as John Bull.&quot;

<doc id="325918" wikidata="Q182260" url="?curid=325918" title="Jeanne Calment">
<text>Jeanne Louise Calment (; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French supercentenarian and, with a documented lifespan of 122 years and 164 days, the oldest person ever whose age has been verified. Her longevity attracted media attention and medical studies of her health and lifestyle. She is the only person in history who has been verified to have reached the age of 120.

According to census records, Calment outlived both her daughter and her grandson. In January 1988, she was widely reported to be the oldest living person, and in 1995, at age 120, was declared the oldest verified person to have ever lived.

== Early life ==

Calment was born on 21 February 1875 in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhône, Provence. Some of her close family members also had an above-average lifespan as her older brother, François (1865–1962), lived to the age of 97, her father, Nicolas (1837–1931), who was a shipbuilder, 93, and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (1838–1924), who was from a family of millers, 86.

From the age of seven until her First Communion, she attended Mrs. Benet&#x27;s church primary school in Arles, and then the local &quot;collège&quot; (secondary school), finishing at 16 with the &quot;brevet classique&quot; diploma. Asked about her daily routine while at primary school, she replied that &quot;when you are young, you get up at eight o&#x27;clock&quot;. In lieu of a solid breakfast, she would have either coffee with milk, or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon. In the following years, she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills.

== Adult life ==
On 8 April 1896, at the age of 21, Jeanne married her double second cousin, Fernand Nicolas Calment (1868–1942). Their paternal grandfathers were brothers, and their paternal grandmothers were sisters. He had reportedly started courting her when she was 15, but Jeanne was &quot;too young to be interested in boys&quot;. Fernand was heir to a drapery business located in a classic Provençal-style building in the centre of Arles, and the couple moved into a spacious apartment above the family store. Jeanne employed servants and never had to work; she led a leisurely lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling, tennis, swimming, rollerskating, playing the piano, and making music with friends. In the summer, the couple would stay at Uriage for mountaineering on the glacier. They also went hunting for rabbits and wild boars in the hills of Provence, using an &quot;18mm rifle&quot;. Calment said she disliked shooting birds. She gave birth to her only child, a daughter named Yvonne Marie Nicolle Calment, on 19 January 1898. Yvonne married army officer Joseph Billot on 3 February 1926, and their only son, Frédéric, was born on 23 December of the same year. At the outbreak of World War I, Jeanne&#x27;s husband Fernand, who was 46, was deemed too old to serve in the military.

Yvonne died of pleurisy on 19 January 1934, her 36th birthday, after which Calment raised Frédéric, although he lived with his father in the neighbouring apartment. World War II had little effect on Jeanne&#x27;s life. She said that German soldiers slept in her rooms but &quot;did not take anything away&quot;, so that she bore no grudge against them. In 1942, her husband Fernand died, aged 73, reportedly of cherry poisoning. By the 1954 census, she was still registered in the same apartment, together with her son-in-law, retired Colonel Billot, Yvonne&#x27;s widower; the census documents list Jeanne as &quot;mother&quot; in 1954 and &quot;widow&quot; in 1962. Her grandson Frédéric Billot lived next door with his wife Renée. Her brother François died in 1962, aged 97. Her son-in-law Joseph died in January 1963, and her grandson Frédéric died in an automobile accident in August of the same year.

In 1965, aged 90 and with no heirs left, Calment signed a life estate contract on her apartment with civil law notary André-François Raffray, selling the property in exchange for a right of occupancy and a monthly revenue of 2,500 francs (€380) until her death. Raffray died on 25 December 1995, by which time Calment had received more than double the apartment&#x27;s value from him, and his family had to continue making payments. She commented on the situation by saying, &quot;in life, one sometimes makes bad deals&quot;. In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110. A documentary film about her life, entitled &quot;Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment&quot;, was released in 1995. In 1996, &quot;Time&#x27;s Mistress&quot;, a four-track CD of Jeanne speaking over musical backing tracks in various styles, including rap, was released.

=== Longevity records ===
In 1986, Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111. Her profile increased during the centennial of Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s move to Arles, which occurred from February 1888 to April 1889 when she was 13 and 14 years old. Calment claimed to reporters that she had met van Gogh at that time, introduced to him by her future husband in her uncle&#x27;s fabric shop. She remembered that van Gogh gave her a condescending look, as if unimpressed by her. She described his personality as ugly, ungracious, and &quot;very disagreeable&quot;, adding that he &quot;reeked of alcohol&quot;. Calment said that she forgave van Gogh for his bad manners.

She was recognised by &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s oldest living person in 1988, when she was 112. However, the Gerontology Research Group has since then validated the age of Easter Wiggins (1 June 1874 – 7 July 1990), meaning that in reality Calment became the world&#x27;s oldest living person in 1990. At the age of 114, she briefly appeared in the 1990 fantasy film &quot;Vincent and Me&quot;, walking outside and answering questions.

Her status further increased when &quot;Guinness&quot; named her the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995. This was based on her surpassing the now-debunked age claim of Japanese man Shigechiyo Izumi. As a result of Izumi&#x27;s validation being withdrawn, Calment had already been the oldest person ever since surpassing the age of Easter Wiggins on 30 March 1991. Far exceeding any other verified human lifespan, Calment is widely reckoned as the best-documented supercentenarian recorded. For example, she was listed in fourteen census records, beginning in 1876 as a one-year-old infant. After Calment&#x27;s death, at 122 years and 164 days, then almost 117-year-old Canadian woman Marie-Louise Meilleur became the oldest validated living person. Several claims to have surpassed Calment&#x27;s age were made, but none have ever been proven. For about three decades, Calment has held the status of the oldest human being whose age has been validated by modern standards.

=== Age verification ===
In 1994, the city of Arles inquired about Calment&#x27;s personal documents, in order to contribute to the city archives. However, reportedly on Calment&#x27;s instructions, her documents and family photographs were selectively burned by a distant family member, Josette Bigonnet, a cousin of her grandson. The verification of her age began in 1995 when she turned 120, and was conducted over a full year. She was asked questions about documented details concerning relatives, and about people and places from her early life, for instance teachers or maids. A great deal of emphasis was put on a series of documents from population censuses, in which Calment was named from 1876 to 1975. The family&#x27;s membership in the local Catholic &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; helped researchers find corroborating chains of documentary evidence. Calment&#x27;s father had been a member of the city council, and her husband owned a large drapery and clothing business. The family lived in two apartments located in the same building as the store, one for Calment, her husband and his mother, one for their daughter Yvonne, her husband and their child. Several house servants were registered in the premises as well.

=== Popular media reports ===
Apocryphal media articles reported varying details, some of them unlikely. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling coloured pencils to Vincent van Gogh, reportedly remembering him later as &quot;dirty, badly dressed and disagreeable&quot;, and seeing the Eiffel Tower being built. Another wrote that she started fencing in 1960, aged 85. Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in olive oil.

=== Controversy regarding age ===
Demographers have highlighted that Calment&#x27;s age is an outlier, her lifespan being several years longer than the next oldest people ever documented, where the differences are usually by months or weeks. There have been various speculations about the authenticity of her age. In 2018, Russian gerontologist Valery Novoselov and mathematician Nikolay Zak revived the hypothesis that Jeanne died in 1934 and her daughter Yvonne, born in 1898, assumed her mother&#x27;s official identity and was therefore 99 years old when she died in 1997. Around the same time, a series of related posts by gerontology blogger Yuri Deigin, titled &quot;J&#x27;Accuse!&quot;, had gone viral on &quot;Medium.&quot; This hypothesis is considered weak by mainstream longevity experts, such as French gerontologist Jean-Marie Robine,
who pointed out that during his research, Calment had correctly answered questions about things that her daughter could not have known first-hand. Robine also dismissed the idea that the residents of Arles could have been duped by the switch. Another doctor who had helped verify Calment&#x27;s records said that the team had considered the identity-switch hypothesis while Calment was still alive because she looked younger than her daughter in photographs, but similar discrepancies in the rates of aging are commonly found in families with centenarian members.

After consulting several experts, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;statistically improbable is not the same thing as statistically impossible&quot;, that Novoselov and Zak&#x27;s claims are generally dismissed by the overwhelming majority of experts, and found them &quot;lacking, if not outright deficient&quot;. In September 2019, several French scientists released a paper in &quot;The Journals of Gerontology&quot; pointing out inaccuracies in the Zak et al. paper.

The team presented evidence to support Calment&#x27;s age – including multiple official documents, census data, and photographic evidence – and also argued that it was indeed statistically possible to reach Calment&#x27;s age. The authors criticised the advocates of the identity switch hypothesis, and called for a retraction of Zak&#x27;s article. In February 2020, Zak and Philip Gibbs published an assessment applying Bayes&#x27; theorem to the question of her authenticity, noting that, while being subjective, it gave &quot;a 99.99% chance of an identity switch in the case of Mme Calment&quot;. François Robin-Champigneul and Robert Young commented on Zak&#x27;s and Gibbs&#x27; findings, with Robin-Champigneul saying that it &quot;appears to be in fact a subjective and nonrigorous analysis&quot;, and Young saying that &quot;[i]gnoring the actual facts of the case and stringing together opinions in a &#x27;Bayesian&#x27; analysis are to merely misuse a mathematical tool&quot;. Young is said to have found that &quot;a very solid case that Jeanne was 122 years has already been made&quot; but that biosampling was still needed to test &quot;for biomarkers of extraordinary longevity&quot;. Robin-Champigneul stated that &quot;the hypothesis of an identity swap with her daughter appears not even realistic given the context and the facts, and not supported by evidence&quot;.

Since Jeanne Calment had 16 distinct great-great-grandparents while her daughter Yvonne had only 12, geneticists have noted that the question of identity could easily be settled by a test for autozygous DNA if a blood or tissue sample were to be made available.

== Health and lifestyle ==
Calment&#x27;s health presaged her later record. On television she stated &quot;&quot; (). At age 20, incipient cataracts were discovered when she suffered a major episode of conjunctivitis. She married at 21, and her husband&#x27;s wealth allowed her to live without working. All her life she took care of her skin with olive oil and a puff of powder. At an unspecified time in her youth, she had suffered from migraines. Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after meals, but she did not smoke outside these post-meal occasions. Calment continued smoking in her elderly years until she was 117. At &quot;retirement age&quot;, she broke her ankle, but before that had never suffered any major injuries. She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday. Around age 100, she fractured her leg, but she recovered quickly and was able to walk again.

After her brother, her son-in-law and her grandson died in 1962–63, Calment had no remaining family members. She lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite to her hands.

=== Daily routine ===
After her admission to the Maison du Lac nursing home in January 1985, aged almost 110, Calment initially followed a highly ritualised daily routine. She requested to be awoken at 6:45a.m., and started the day with a long prayer at her window, thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting. She sometimes loudly asked the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one to be still alive in her family. Seated on her armchair, she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and stretching the hands, then the legs. Nurses noted that she moved faster than other residents who were 30 years younger. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk and rusks.

She washed herself unassisted with a flannel cloth rather than taking a shower, applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed &quot;daube&quot; (braised beef), but was not keen on boiled fish. She had dessert with every meal, and said that given a choice she would eat fried and spicy foods instead of the bland foods on the menu. She made herself daily fruit salads with bananas and oranges. She enjoyed chocolate, sometimes indulging in a kilogram (2.2 lb) per week. After the meal, she smoked a cigarette and drank a small amount of port wine. In the afternoon, she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall, she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her poor eyesight preventing her from enjoying her crosswords pastime), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10:00p.m. On Sundays, she went to Mass, and on Fridays she went to Vespers and regularly prayed to and sought help from God and wondered about the afterlife.

=== Medical follow-up ===
Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine, and the second presents her medical history. She stated that she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember which vaccine(s). Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract German measles, chickenpox, or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to a hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. Later she suffered from arthropathy in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was , and her weight , showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.

Analyses of her blood samples were in normal ranges between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the DR1 allele, common among centenarians. A cardiological assessment revealed a moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis, as well as incipient osteoarthritis in the right hip. An ultrasound exam showed no anomalies of internal organs. At this stage, Calment was still in good health, and continued to walk without a cane. She fell in January 1990 (aged almost 115) and fractured her femur, which required surgery. Subsequently, Calment used a wheelchair, and she abandoned her daily routine.

At the age of 115, Calment attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Michel Allard, who collaborated with her attending doctor, Victor Lèbre, to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. According to their year-long analysis, Calment&#x27;s vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to undergo a routine operation to restore her eyesight; she had a moderately weak heart, a chronic cough, and bouts of rheumatism. On the other hand, her digestion was always good, she slept well, and did not have incontinence. During the last years, she was tall, and weighed ; she confirmed that she had always been small, and had lost weight in recent years. Her eyes were light grey, and her white hair had once been chestnut brown.

At the age of 118, she was submitted to repeated neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency were comparable to those of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration, and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was observed to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained &quot;mentally sharp&quot; until the end of her life.

== Death ==
Calment died of unspecified causes on 4 August 1997 around 10:00a.m. in her nursing home in Arles, France. She was 122 years and 164 days old. &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Robine as stating that she had been in good health, though almost blind and deaf, as little as a month before her death.

<text>A picayune was a Spanish coin, worth half a real or one sixteenth of a dollar. Its name derives from the French &quot;picaillon&quot;, which is itself from the Provençal &quot;picaioun&quot;, the name of an unrelated small copper coin from Savoy. By extension, can mean &quot;trivial&quot; or &quot;of little value&quot;.

Aside from being used in Spanish territories, the picayune and other Spanish currency was used throughout the colonial United States. Spanish dollars were made legal tender in the U.S. by an act on February 9, 1793. They remained so until demonetization on February 21, 1857. The coin&#x27;s name first appeared in Florida and Louisiana, where its value was nominally one sixteenth of a dollar, i.e. cents, and whose name was sometimes used in place of the U.S. nickel.

A newspaper published in New Orleans since the 1830s, the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; (originally &quot;The Picayune&quot;), was named after the coin.

A city in southern Mississippi has the name Picayune.

<doc id="325938" wikidata="Q4154199" url="?curid=325938" title="Furthur (bus)">
<text>Furthur is a 1939 International Harvester school bus purchased by author Ken Kesey in 1964 to carry his &quot;Merry Band of Pranksters&quot; cross-country, filming their counterculture adventures as they went. The bus featured prominently in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1968 book &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; but, due to the chaos of the trip and editing difficulties, footage of the journey was not released as a film until the 2011 documentary &quot;Magic Trip&quot;.

==History==
Kesey traveled to New York City in November 1963 with his wife Faye and Prankster George Walker to attend the Broadway opening of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, which was based on his 1962 novel. Kesey also saw the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair site under construction. He needed to return to New York City in 1964 for the publication party for his novel &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;, and hoped to use the occasion to visit the Fair. This plan grew into an ambitious scheme to bring along a group of friends, turning their adventures into a road movie, taking inspiration from Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1957 novel &quot;On the Road&quot;.

As more Pranksters volunteered for the trip, they soon realized they outgrew Kesey&#x27;s station wagon, so Kesey bought a retired yellow school bus for $1,250 from Andre Hobson of Atherton, California. The license plates read &quot;MAZ 804&quot;. Hobson had added bunks, a bathroom, and a kitchen with refrigerator, and stove for taking his eleven children on vacation.

The Pranksters added customizations, including a generator, a sound system (with an interior and external intercom), a railing and seating platform on top of the bus, and an observation turret coming out the top made from a washing machine drum fitted into a hole in the roof. Another platform was welded to the rear to hold the generator and a motorcycle. The bus was painted by the various Pranksters in a variety of psychedelic colors and designs. The paint was not day-glo (which was not yet common in 1964) but primary colors, and the peace symbol was not yet evident. The word &#x27;Sunshine&#x27; was written in blue, but it was too early to have references to orange sunshine LSD or Kesey&#x27;s not-yet-conceived daughter Sunshine.

The bus was named by artist Roy Sebern, painting the word &quot;Furthur&quot; (with two U&#x27;s, quickly corrected) on the destination placard as a kind of one-word poem and inspiration to keep going whenever the bus broke down. The misspelled name is still often used, as in Wolfe&#x27;s book.

The original bus&#x27;s last journey was a trip to the Woodstock Festival in 1969. After its historic trips, the bus was gutted and used around the Keseys&#x27; farm in Oregon until at least 1983. It was mentioned and pictured in an article in the May–June &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. It was eventually parked in the swamp on Kesey&#x27;s Farm and gradually returned to the elements, until it was dragged out of the swamp with a tractor and stored in a farm warehouse.

==Participants==

The list of participants is undocumented. They took the general name &quot;Merry Band of Pranksters&quot; shortened to Merry Pranksters, but many Pranksters chose not to go, and others became Pranksters only because they chose to go.

Chloe Scott (founder of the Dymaxion Dance Group in 1962, age about 39) only lasted a day, because the chaos was too much for her. Cathy Casamo, friend of Mike Hagen, joined at the last minute, hoping to star in the movie they were supposedly making, but she was left behind in Houston. Neal Cassady showed up at the last minute and displaced Roy Sebern as driver, as far as New York state. Ken Babbs probably did not plan to venture past his San Juan Capistrano home. Merry Prankster and author Lee Quarnstrom documents events on the bus in his memoir, &quot;When I Was a Dynamiter!&quot;

Jane Burton, George Walker, Steve Lambrecht, Paula Sundsten (Gretchen Fetchin), Sandy Lehmann-Haupt (sound engineer, younger brother of Christopher, and important source for Tom Wolfe&#x27;s account ), Page Browning, Ron Bevirt (photographer and bookstore owner), and siblings Chuck Kesey, Dale Kesey, and John Babbs are also named as participants.

The group decided to dress in red, white, and blue stripes (so they could claim to be loyal patriots), maybe with distinctive patterns so they&#x27;d be easier for future film-goers to tell apart. They brought a Confederate flag, too. Their haircuts were conservative; long hair came into fashion with the Beatles.

Tom Wolfe&#x27;s book gives the misleading impression he was a participant (he met Kesey the following year). Carolyn &quot;Mountain Girl&quot; Adams Garcia (not present) is often confused with Cathy Casamo. Kesey&#x27;s wife Faye is sometimes included, and Furthur-painter Roy Sebern. Robert Stone met them briefly in New York city.

== Drugs ==
Kesey had a generous supply of the then-legal psychedelic drug LSD, and they reportedly also took 500 Benzedrine pills (speed), and a shoebox full of rolled marijuana cigarettes.

They were stopped several times by the government, but explained they were filmmakers. Until 1965, drug use received too little media attention for officials to be suspicious.

== The first trip ==
Beat writer Neal Cassady was at the wheel on their maiden voyage from La Honda, California to New York (Sebern says he was their designated-driver before Cassady). They left on June 17, 1964, but because of various vehicle problems, it took them 24 hours to go the first . George Walker recalls, &quot;We left La Honda on June 14, 1964, about 3pm First stop, on Kesey&#x27;s bridge, out of gas! Made it about 100 feet.&quot;

Their route took them first to San Jose, California, then Los Angeles. Chloe Scott bailed in San Jose, and Cathy Casamo joined them. They spent two days at Ken Babbs&#x27; home in San Juan Capistrano, painting his swimming pool (one version claims he joined at that point.)

Outside Wikieup, Arizona they got stuck in the sand by a pond, and had an intense LSD party while waiting for a tractor to pull them out. In Phoenix, they confounded the Barry Goldwater presidential headquarters by painting &quot;A VOTE FOR BARRY IS A VOTE FOR FUN!&quot; above the bus windows on the left side, and driving backward through the downtown. Casamo apparently took too much LSD in Wikieup, and spent much of the drive from Phoenix to Houston standing naked on the rear platform, to the amusement of the truckers following Furthur down the highway.

In Houston, they visited the Houston Zoo, then author Larry McMurtry&#x27;s suburban home. Casamo&#x27;s antics led to her being briefly institutionalized, so the Pranksters left her behind, and another friend drove her back home (Kesey&#x27;s &quot;Further Inquiry&quot; wrestles with his enduring guilt about these events.)

In New Orleans, Cassady showed them the nightlife, then the Pranksters accidentally went swimming in a &#x27;blacks only&#x27; area on Lake Pontchartrain.

Their next destination was Pensacola, Florida to visit a friend of Babbs, then up the east coast to New York City, arriving around June 29.

=== New York ===
In New York, they picked up novelist Robert Stone (who recounted his viewpoint in his 2007 book &quot;Prime Green&quot;). They reunited with Chloe Scott, and staged a party at her apartment, attended by Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. They also visited the World&#x27;s Fair. Ginsberg arranged a visit with LSD enthusiasts Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert in Millbrook, New York, but the West Coast style of partying was too wild for the Millbrook academics.

Their route home, without Cassady to drive, took them through Canada. They arrived back in La Honda in August.

=== Aftermath ===
Kesey and Babbs took on the frustrating challenge of editing over 100 hours of silent film footage and separate (unsynchronized) audio tapes. They previewed their progress at regular open parties every weekend at Kesey&#x27;s place, evolving into the &#x27;Acid Tests&#x27; with live music from the Grateful Dead (known first as the Warlocks).

Tom Wolfe used the film and tapes as the basis of his book, but Kesey&#x27;s edit was never finished or released, in part because Kesey was arrested in 1965 for marijuana possession (LSD would not become illegal until October 1966). Director Alex Gibney finally publicly released a major new edit in 2011 as the documentary &quot;Magic Trip&quot;.

==Other trips==
Other &quot;Furthur&quot; trips included an anti-Vietnam war rally in 1966 and Woodstock and Texas International Pop Festivals, both in 1969 (without Kesey). A race between &quot;Furthur&quot; and three buses from Wavy Gravy&#x27;s Hog Farm is recounted in the July 1969 &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;. More can be read about the adventures of the Merry Pranksters on &quot;Furthur&quot; in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1968 book &quot;The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test&quot;, for which a movie directed by Gus Van Sant is in development.

==Second bus==
In 1990 Kesey created a second Further/Furthur, this one from a 1947 International Harvester bus. The second bus is labeled &quot;Further&quot; on the front and &quot;Furthur&quot; on the back. It is not called Furthur 2, and is not meant as a replica, although confusion between the two buses is intentional. The bus was created to coincide with the publication of Kesey&#x27;s memoirs about the 1964 trip, entitled &quot;The Further Inquiry&quot; ().

The original 1964 &quot;Furthur&quot; was eventually dragged out of the swamp with a tractor and now resides in a warehouse at Kesey&#x27;s farm in Oregon, alongside the 1990 &quot;Further&quot;.

===Smithsonian Caper===
The &quot;Great Smithsonian Caper&quot; was a prank perpetrated on the media. Reporters and journalists came to the farm while Kesey and friends were painting the new bus, and later, broadcast &quot;Ken Kesey restored the original Furthur and is taking it to the Smithsonian.&quot; The next morning, a variety of national media were asking to &quot;come along on the trip to the Smithsonian.&quot; The media rode along on Furthur for about a week, believing it was the original bus and it was donated to the museum.

===Apple party===
In 1993, Kesey drove the second bus to California to speak at a private party hosted by Apple Computer. Apparently, the party producers claimed no knowledge of his history or politics, and after his drug references, they removed him from the stage. Then, they blocked the bus from leaving the parking lot, so Kesey schmoozed around the event until it ended.

===Restoration===

The second &quot;Furthur&quot; bus was refurbished and toured the country as part of a &quot;Furthur 50th Anniversary Trip&quot; in the summer of 2014. This trip was documented for the 2016 documentary film &quot;Going Furthur&quot;.

==Cultural significance==
The cross-country trip of &quot;Furthur&quot; and the activities of the Merry Pranksters, with the success of Wolfe&#x27;s book and other media accounts, led to a number of psychedelic buses appearing in popular media over the next few years, including in the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (1967 film), Medicine Ball Caravan (1971) and &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979 film). A similar bus was created for the 1990 film &quot;Flashback&quot;. The bus appears as inspiration for the cover and in the Amazon short story &quot;Existential Trips&quot; by William Bevill. Both Kesey and original Prankster Ken Babbs released books in 1990 recounting their famous adventure (Kesey&#x27;s was called &quot;The Further Inquiry&quot; () and Babbs&#x27; was &quot;On the Bus&quot; ()).

In the 2007 film, &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, a fictionalized version of the bus appears, this one a Chevrolet bearing the name &quot;Beyond&quot; in place of &quot;Furthur&quot;. The bus also figures obliquely as a &quot;technicolor motor home&quot; in the Steely Dan song &quot;Kid Charlemagne&quot; (1976), about another LSD proponent, Owsley Stanley. The G4 original television show &quot;Code Monkeys&quot; (2007) references the bus in the first episode of the second season: a character voiced by Tommy Chong tells the legend of Chester Hopperpot, a psychedelic pioneer touring the country in a magical hippie bus called &quot;Farther&quot;. Ken Kesey&#x27;s quote &quot;You&#x27;re either on the bus or off the bus,&quot; as quoted by Tom Wolfe, is often repeated as a counter-culture slogan. In the Grateful Dead song &quot;The Other One&quot;, Bob Weir sings the lyric &quot;the bus came by and I got on, that&#x27;s when it all began, there was cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land&quot;, an apparent reference to the original &quot;Furthur&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, extendible cardinals are large cardinals introduced by , who was partly motivated by reflection principles. Intuitively, such a cardinal represents a point beyond which initial pieces of the universe of sets start to look similar, in the sense that each is elementarily embeddable into a later one.

==Definition==
For every ordinal &quot;η&quot;, a cardinal κ is called η-extendible if for some ordinal &quot;λ&quot; there is a nontrivial elementary embedding &quot;j&quot; of &quot;V&quot;κ+η into &quot;V&quot;λ, where &quot;κ&quot; is the critical point of &quot;j&quot;, and as usual &quot;Vα&quot; denotes the &quot;α&quot;th level of the von Neumann hierarchy. A cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is called an extendible cardinal if it is &quot;η&quot;-extendible for every nonzero ordinal &quot;η&quot; (Kanamori 2003).

==Properties==
For a cardinal formula_1, say that a logic formula_2 is formula_1-compact if for every set formula_4 of formula_2-sentences, if every subset of formula_4 or cardinality formula_7 has a model, then formula_4 has a model. (The usual compactness theorem shows formula_9-compactness of first-order logic.) Let formula_10 be the infinitary logic for second-order set theory, permitting infinitary conjunctions and disjunctions of length formula_7. formula_1 is extendible iff formula_10 is formula_1-compact.

==Variants and relation to other cardinals==
A cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is called &quot;η-C(n)&quot;-extendible if there is an elementary embedding &quot;j&quot; witnessing that &quot;κ&quot; is &quot;η&quot;-extendible (that is, &quot;j&quot; is elementary from &quot;Vκ+η&quot; to some &quot;Vλ&quot; with critical point &quot;κ&quot;) such that furthermore, &quot;Vj(κ)&quot; is &quot;Σn&quot;-correct in &quot;V&quot;. That is, for every &quot;Σn&quot; formula &quot;φ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot; holds in &quot;Vj(κ)&quot; if and only if &quot;φ&quot; holds in &quot;V&quot;. A cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is said to be C(n)-extendible if it is &quot;η-C(n)&quot;-extendible for every ordinal &quot;η&quot;. Every extendible cardinal is &quot;C(1)&quot;-extendible, but for &quot;n≥1&quot;, the least &quot;C(n)&quot;-extendible cardinal is never &quot;C(n+1)&quot;-extendible (Bagaria 2011).

Vopěnka&#x27;s principle implies the existence of extendible cardinals; in fact, Vopěnka&#x27;s principle (for definable classes) is equivalent to the existence of &quot;C(n)&quot;-extendible cardinals for all &quot;n&quot; (Bagaria 2011). All extendible cardinals are supercompact cardinals (Kanamori 2003).

<text>The Beauvoir estate, built in Biloxi, Mississippi, along the Gulf of Mexico, was the post-war home (1876–1889) of the former President of the Confederate States of America Jefferson Davis. The National Park Service designated the house and plantation as a National Historic Landmark in 1974.

Samuel Dorsey, a planter, purchased the estate in 1873. After Dorsey died in 1875, his widow, Sarah Dorsey, learned that Davis was facing difficulties. Dorsey invited Davis to visit the plantation, offering him a cottage near the main house where he could live and work on his memoirs. Davis ended up living there the rest of his life with his wife, Varina Davis, and his youngest daughter, Varina Anne Davis (known as &quot;Winnie&quot;).

Ill with cancer in 1878, Dorsey remade her will, bequeathing Beauvoir to Jefferson Davis and making Winnie the residuary legatee, inheriting after her father died. The three Davises lived at Beauvoir until Jefferson Davis died in 1889. Varina and Winnie moved to New York City in 1891.

After Winnie died in 1898, Varina Davis inherited the plantation. Davis sold it in 1902 to the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans with the stipulation that it be used as a Confederate States Army veterans home and later as a memorial to her husband. Barracks were built nearby, and the property was used as such a home until 1957, with the death of the last Confederate veteran in Mississippi. At that time, the main house was adapted as a house museum. In 1998, a library was completed and opened on-site.

Beauvoir survived Hurricane Camille in 1969. The main house and library were badly damaged, and other outbuildings were destroyed during Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. The house was restored and reopened while work continued on the library.

== Description ==
The name &quot;Beauvoir&quot; means &quot;beautiful to view&quot;. When Davis lived there, Beauvoir consisted of approximately . Cedars, oaks, and magnolia trees surrounded the house, which once had an orange grove behind it. The home faces the Gulf of Mexico, and Spanish moss hangs from many of the large old trees on the property. Oyster Bayou, a freshwater impediment and bay-head swamp once connected directly to the Mississippi Sound, runs across the property behind the main house from West to East. This body of water is fed by natural artesian springs on the grounds. The northeast portion of the estate is the site of a primitive, pre-urban hardwood forest with an environment similar to what existed in the area during the 1800s.

Today, the site is approximately in size). It is located across US Highway 90 from Biloxi Beach. The compound now consists of a Louisiana-raised summer cottage-style residence, a botanical garden, a former Confederate veterans home, a modern gift shop, a Confederate Soldier Museum, the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library and Museum, various outbuildings, and a historic Confederate cemetery, which includes the Tomb of the Unknown Confederate Soldier. Five of seven of these buildings were destroyed in Hurricane Katrina, and replicas are being planned. Current proposals envision restoring Oyster Bayou to its original environmental state, although this area suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina.

== History ==

Beauvoir was built by James Brown, a planter and entrepreneur, in 1848 and was completed in 1852. In 1873 the property was sold to Frank Johnston and soon thereafter to Samuel and Sarah Anne Ellis Dorsey. They operated the plantation to cultivate cotton. Sarah Dorsey was a novelist and historian who wrote a biography of the Louisiana wartime governor, Henry Watkins Allen. It has been considered a prominent example of Lost Cause literature. Born and reared in Natchez, Mississippi, she was part of the prominent Percy family in the South. After her husband, who was older, died in 1875, the widow Dorsey lived in the main house with her half-brother Mortimer Dahlgren.

In 1876, having heard of Jefferson Davis&#x27; financial and personal difficulties, Dorsey invited Davis to stay at Beauvoir. She made a cottage available to him and assisted him in writing his memoir, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government&quot; (1881), by organizing, taking dictation, and encouraging him.

Davis accepted Dorsey&#x27;s invitation and moved into the cottage now known as the &quot;Library Pavilion&quot; on the plantation grounds in 1877. Later, his wife Varina joined him.

Davis arranged to purchase the property in 1879 for $5500 (~$ in ) to be paid in three installments. In 1878, Dorsey had rewritten her will as she knew she was dying; she bequeathed the plantation to Davis and his daughter. Dorsey died in 1879.

Davis and Varina moved into the main house with their youngest daughter, Winnie. She was single as they had refused to let her marry into the family of a Yankee abolitionist. Davis lived in the home until his death in December 1889. Varina Davis remained on the property while writing her book &quot;Jefferson Davis: A Memoir&quot; (1890). She and her daughter Winnie moved to New York City in 1892.

Dorsey had provided that, after Davis&#x27; death, Beauvoir would go to his daughter. At her death in 1898, the property was inherited by Varina Howell Davis. In 1902, she sold much of the property to the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) to be used as a home for Confederate veterans and widows and later as a memorial to her husband. The SCV built a dozen barracks buildings, a hospital, and a chapel behind the main house. From 1903 to 1957, approximately 2,500 veterans and their families lived at the home. Many veterans were buried in a cemetery on the property.

In 1941 the main house opened for public tours. Eventually, a Confederate Museum was opened on the site. Over the next few decades, a Jefferson Davis Gallery, gift shop, the Tomb of the Unknown Confederate Soldier, and the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library and Museum were established on the grounds.

In 1969 the home survived Hurricane Camille. It needed some repairs and restoration after flooding.

In 1998 the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans opened the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library. It contains the personal library and papers of Jefferson Davis, a biographical exhibit, and a theater and lecture hall.

===Hurricane Katrina===

====Damage assessment====
On August 29, 2005, the main building was severely damaged, losing its newly refurbished galleries (porches) and a section of its roof, but not destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, which hit the Biloxi-Gulfport area head-on. &quot;The Clarion-Ledger&quot; reported on August 31 that Beauvoir was &quot;virtually demolished,&quot; overstating the damage. The storm destroyed the Hayes Cottage, the Library Pavilion, a barracks replica, the Confederate Museum, and the director&#x27;s home. The storm gutted the first floor of the Davis Presidential Library. Approximately 40% of the collection was lost.

Although the extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina required a massive restoration project for &quot;Beauvoir&quot;, the publicity caused detailed U.S. Government photos of the building to become widely available, revealing some architectural details and part of the internal structure of the original construction.

At the &quot;Beauvoir&quot; entranceway, above the door and left-side window, dentil molding appears along the lintel of the door and window. The internal construction of the building is also revealed, seen in exposed areas of the structure, such as the basement red-brick pillars or the wooden wall frames, with wooden latticework backing the external plaster covering. The exterior shell of &quot;Beauvoir&quot; was protected by six fireplaces surrounding the house&#x27;s core. Of those six brick fireplaces reinforcing the outside walls, only one of six rooftop chimneys collapsed during the hurricane. Five of the six fireplaces retained sufficient structural integrity to keep the walls of the building from falling away while underwater.

On the back, west wing of &quot;Beauvoir&quot;, behind a front-yard tree, the green storm shutters survived the floating debris that battered the entrance. The shutters protected the glass panes despite the 24-foot (8-m) storm surge that submerged the area. Whole sections of the &quot;Beauvoir&quot; home have remained intact to preserve many of the original construction details and windows (as seen in the photograph excerpts, at right).

====Restoration – buildings====
Since thousands of homes in Mississippi were damaged or destroyed during Hurricane Katrina, construction work was diverted to all state disaster areas. Restoration of &quot;Beauvoir&quot; proceeded slowly. However, as it is a U.S. National Historic Landmark, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials approved Federal support for the repair and rebuilding of the Beauvoir complex.

With various federal, state, and private organizations&#x27; financial assistance and individual contributions, restoring Beauvoir Mansion started in early 2006. On June 3, 2008, Jefferson Davis&#x27; 200th Birthday, Beauvoir Mansion was fully restored and reopened for public tours. The mansion was restored to its original condition when Jefferson and Varina Davis lived there.

In the winter of 2009, Davis&#x27;s library and Hayes&#x27;s cottage were rebuilt and open for public tours.

The Jefferson Davis Presidential Library and Museum opened in June 2013. Many artifacts were recovered and were restored or repaired from the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina.

In addition to the Presidential Library, the historic kitchen behind the Beauvoir mansion was reconstructed.

Funding for the renovation included $17.2 million from state and federal sources.

====Restoration – collections====
About 60% of the collections are estimated to be salvageable. Before Katrina, the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library maintained a collection of 12,000 books on United States history, southern history, and history of the American Civil War. The library also maintained collections of photographs, personal letters, manuscripts, envelopes, postcards, newspaper clippings, records of Confederate heritage organizations such as the United Confederate Veterans and the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and records from the veterans home that once was present on the grounds. Most of these records survived except those on display in the two museums.

Civilian volunteers and the Mississippi Army National Guard assisted with salvage. Unfortunately, the room storing much of the authentic china and artifacts was adjacent to the gift shop, with replicas of the originals. Both rooms were destroyed, so sifting through the debris and identifying the genuine relics was very difficult.

==Today==
Beauvoir is owned and operated by the Mississippi Division of Sons of Confederate Veterans. &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine reported in 2018 that the museum communicates the Lost Cause perspective, including characterizing slavery as a positive institution and minor factor in the Civil War. It also reports that the State of Mississippi gives an annual grant of $100,000 (~$ in ) for maintenance.

===Activities===

Before the destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina, annual events included the Spring Pilgrimage in March, Confederate Memorial Day in April, the Fall Muster in October, and Candlelight Christmas in December. As of 2018, the Fall Muster is described as the &quot;highlight&quot; of the calendar.

Visitors to the site were presented with a biographical film on the life of Jefferson Davis narrated by an actor portraying Davis&#x27;s long-time friend, Iowa Senator George Wallace Jones.

== Designations ==
The home and grounds are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Beauvoir was also designated as a National Historic Landmark and a Mississippi Historical Landmark.

<doc id="325953" wikidata="Q201463" url="?curid=325953" title="Pearl River">
<text>The Pearl River (, or ) is an extensive river system in southern China. &quot;Pearl River&quot; is often also used as a catch-all for the watersheds of the Pearl tributaries within Guangdong, specifically the Xi (&#x27;west&#x27;), Bei (&#x27;north&#x27;), and Dong (&#x27;east&#x27;). These rivers all ultimately flow into the South China Sea through the Pearl River Delta. Measured from the farthest reaches of the Xi River, the Pearl–Xi–Xun–Qian–Hongshui–Nanpan Pearl River system constitutes China&#x27;s third-longest, after the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, and its second largest by volume, after the Yangtze. The Pearl River Basin drains the majority of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces (collectively known as Liangguang), as well as parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan and Jiangxi; it also drains the northernmost parts of Vietnam&#x27;s Northeast Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn provinces. The Pearl River is famed as the river that flows through Guangzhou.

As well as referring to the system as a whole, the Pearl River name is applied to a specific branch within it. This Pearl River is the widest distributary within the delta, although notably short; the waters that converge east of the Bei are first referred to as the Pearl River just north of Guangzhou. The Pearl River&#x27;s estuary, Bocca Tigris, is regularly dredged so as to keep it open for ocean vessels. The mouth of the Pearl River forms a large bay in the southeast of the delta, the Pearl River Estuary, the Bocca Tigris separates Shiziyang in the north, Lingdingyang in the south, and Jiuzhouyang at the southern tip of the estuary surrounded by the Wanshan Archipelago. This bay separates Macau and Zhuhai from Hong Kong and Shenzhen.

The name &quot;Pearl River&quot; comes from the pearl-colored shells that lie within the Pearl&#x27;s riverbed as it flows through the city of Guangzhou. A 500 kV power line, suspended from three of the tallest pylons in the world, crosses the river near the Nansha Bridge.

<text>Synbranchiformes, often called swamp eels, though that name can also refer specifically to Synbranchidae, is an order of ray-finned fishes that are eel-like but have spiny rays, indicating that they belong to the superorder Acanthopterygii.

==Taxonomy==
No synbrachiform fossil is known. The Mastacembeloidei were removed from the Perciformes and added to the Synbranchiformes after a phylogenetic analysis by Johnson and Patterson. These authors consider the Synbranchiformes to be part of a monophyletic group called Smegmamorpha, also containing Mugilimorpha, Atherinomorpha, Gasterosteiformes, and Elassomatidae. Later authors have proposed that the Synbranchiformes along with the Anabantiformes, Carangiformes, Istiophoriformes and Pleuronectiformes form a sister clade to the Ovalentaria which has been called the &quot;Carangimorpharia&quot; but in the 5th Edition of Fishes of the World this clade remained unnamed and unranked.

There are a total of about 99 species divided over 15 genera in three families. There are two suborders: Synbranchoidei and Mastacembeloidei, or Opisthomi. The Synbranchoidei has one family, the Synbranchidae; four genera; and 17 species. The Mastacembeloidei has two families: Chaudhuriidae, with four genera and five species, and Mastacembelidae, with three genera and about 26 species.

Modern studies have placed &quot;Indostomus&quot;, the sole genus within the family Indostomidae, within the Synbranchiformes.

==Description==
These eel-like fishes range in size from 8–48 inches (20–150 cm). Although they are eel-like, they are not related to true eels (Anguilliformes). The premaxillae are present as distinct bones and are nonprotrusible. The gills are poorly developed, and their openings are usually single, small, confluent across the breast, and restricted to the lower half of the body. Oxygen is absorbed through the membranes of the throat or intestine. The dorsal and anal fins are low and continuous around the tail tip. Pelvic fins are absent. Scales are either absent or very small. They lack a swim bladder.

==Distribution==
These fishes are distributed in tropical America, tropical Africa, southeastern and eastern Asia, East Indies, and Australia. The three families each have a somewhat different distribution: The Synbranchidae are found in Mexico, Central and South America, West Africa (Liberia), Asia, Hawaii, and the Indo-Australian Archipelago. The Mastacembelidae are found in Africa and through Syria to Maritime Southeast Asia, China, and Korea. The Chaudhuriidae are found in northeastern India through Thailand to Korea (including parts of Malaysia and Borneo).

==Habitat==
All except three species occur in fresh water. They usually are found in swamps, caves, and sluggish fresh and brackish waters. When found in pools, they typically are associated with leaf litter and mats of fine tree roots along the banks. Swamp eels are capable of overland excursions, and some can live out of water for extended periods of time. Some species are burrowers. Four species are found exclusively in caves: &quot;Rakthamichthys eapeni&quot; and &quot;R. roseni&quot; from India, &quot;Ophisternon candidum&quot; from Australia, and &quot;O. infernale&quot; from Mexico. One species, &quot;O. bengalense&quot;, commonly occurs in coastal areas of southeastern Asia.

==Ecology==
Some species are considered air-breathing fishes because of their ability to breathe by highly vascularized buccopharyngeal pouches (pharynx modified for breathing air). They usually are active only at night.

They feed on benthic invertebrates, especially larvae, and fishes.

At least some of the species of the family Synbranchidae, that is, &quot;O. infernale&quot;, are sexually dimorphic. Adult males grow a head hump, and males are larger than females. These fishes lay about 40 spherical eggs per clutch. The eggs measure between 0.05 and 0.06 in (1.2–1.5 mm) in diameter and have a pair of long filaments for adhesion to the substrate. Reproduction takes place during the wet season, which lasts for several months, during which females probably spawn more than once. Data acquired from studying juvenile growth and the length of representative individuals within a population suggests that they are a short-lived species that matures during the first year, with few individuals surviving to the second breeding season.

==Importance to humans==
In some parts of Asia, swamp eels and one species of spiny eel, &quot;Mastacembelus erythrotaenia&quot;, are valued as food and sometimes are kept in ponds or rice fields. Except for a few mastacembelids, they are rarely seen in home aquaria. The fish have numerous sharp dorsal spines and belly thorns which, together with its sliminess make them extremely difficult to handle. The spines must be cut off with scissors before consumption.

<text>The Pearl River is a river in the U.S. states of Mississippi and Louisiana. It forms in Neshoba County, Mississippi from the confluence of Nanih Waiya and Tallahaga creeks, and has a meander length of . The lower part of the river forms part of the boundary between Mississippi and Louisiana.

The river watershed contains large areas of bottomland hardwood swamp and cypress swamp, providing habitat for many species of wildlife, including sturgeon and black bears. As recently as 2008, endangered ivory-billed woodpeckers were reportedly sighted here. The mouth of the river creates important marsh habitat along salinity gradients, which has been the subject of many scientific studies. It is considered to be one of the most critical areas of natural habitat remaining in Louisiana.

Mississippi&#x27;s capital and largest city, Jackson, is located along the upper reaches of the river. Most of the towns along the river, starting with Philadelphia, Mississippi in the north, are within the boundaries of that state.

==Tributaries and hydrology==


The Yockanookany and Strong rivers are tributaries on the upper section of the river north of Jackson: the Lobutcha, Tuscolameta, and Pelahatchie creeks also feed in as tributaries in this region. In 1924 the Tuscolameta Creek received 24-mile channelization and Yockanookany River received a 36-mile canal, which was completed in 1928.

Northeast of Jackson, the Ross Barnett Reservoir was formed by a 1962 dam. Average annual rainfall is about 52 inches in the upper third of the basin, and below Jackson the basin rainfall increases to 64 inches or more, contributing to the greater discharge of the Bogue Chitto as noted below.

The Bogue Chitto River is a major tributary on the lower section. The Bogue Chitto&#x27;s mean low-water discharge to the lower river is nearly six times that of the mean low-water discharge of the Pearl River at Jackson, Mississippi, according to a 1936 government report of the Mississippi Planning Commission. 
West of Picayune, about above the mouth, the river forks.

The East Pearl River empties into Lake Borgne, where the dredged Pearl River Channel meets the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The discharge flows eastward past Grand Island through St. Joe Pass and into the Mississippi Sound. The West Pearl River flows into The Rigolets, thence into Lake Borgne. Both discharges eventually reach the Gulf of Mexico. The Pearl River serves as the boundary between Mississippi and Louisiana in its lower reach near the Gulf of Mexico.

Pearl River provides the receiving waters for the Savanna Street Sewage Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi. which lies about from the mouth of the river.

==Towns on the river==
The following towns (in order, north to south) developed on or near the Pearl River:
* Philadelphia, Mississippi
* Pearl River, Mississippi - named after the river.
* Carthage, Mississippi
* Jackson, Mississippi
* Flowood, Mississippi
* Pearl, Mississippi - named after the river.
* Georgetown, Mississippi
* Rockport, Mississippi
* Monticello, Mississippi
* Columbia, Mississippi
* Bogalusa, Louisiana
* Picayune, Mississippi
* Pearlington, Mississippi - named after the river.
* Pearl River, Louisiana - named after the river.

==Navigation== 
The lower river was navigable from Brashear&#x27;s Stand on the Natchez Trace to the mouth. For the year 1827 the enrolled and licensed tonnage for Pearl River shipping was 750 tons. The customhouse at Pearl River which was ten miles inland at the small town of Pearlington, Mississippi was later changed, but in 1904 the district reported a total of 358 vessels and 19,869 tons. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has undertaken three significant navigation projects in the Pearl River Basin. In 1880, Congress authorized a navigation channel on the West Pearl River from Jackson to the Rigolets. That project was discontinued in 1922. Beginning in 1910, a channel was dredged from the mouth of the East Pearl River into Lake Borgne, a project which is maintained on an irregular basis. In 1935, the West Pearl River Navigation Project was authorized. It provided for a navigation channel from Bogalusa to the mouth of the West Pearl River. The project includes a canal with three locks. The Corps of Engineers placed the project in &quot;caretaker&quot; status in the 1970s because of a decline in commercial traffic. Maintenance dredging resumed in December 1988. In the 1950s, underwater concrete sills were constructed to help maintain water levels in the navigation channel. This has prevented Gulf sturgeon and other migratory species from accessing upstream areas. A rock ramp was designed in 2003 to help fish navigate over one of the sills, but was never constructed. Environmental groups propose further work to mitigate the effects of the navigation project.

Building dams, canals, levees and water control structures is known to have highly negative effects on wetlands and the ecological services they provide. Increasingly, these artificial structures are being removed to allow natural river activities to resume. The Pascagoula River is one of the few remaining southern rivers with natural water regimes, and is a potential model for restoring the Pearl River floodplain. At the Bogalusa, Louisiana gauge the river was recorded in 1983 and 1987 as delivering nearly 3.5 million metric tons and 2.5 million metric tons of sediment respectively.

==Hurricane effects==
Hurricanes are a natural form of disturbance that shapes rivers and watersheds on the Gulf Coast, and has done so for thousands of years. As one recent example, Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, caused further natural changes in the Pearl River. Bottom sediments and marsh vegetation—including uprooted cypress and oak trees—blocked the mouth of the West Pearl and other parts of the channel. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife &amp; Fisheries and other agencies removed 27,000 cubic meters (35,000 yd³) of debris. However, the accumulation of this woody debris is a natural part of floodplain ecosystems in general, and wetlands in particular, and provides vital habitat for species including fish and turtles. Hence, this use of state funds to remove debris was an expenditure on an activity that is known to have negative impacts upon watersheds and wild species.

<text>The Baptist Missionary Association of America (BMAA) is a fellowship of Independent Baptist churches. Historically, churches within the BMAA have generally been associated with theological conservatism and the Landmarkism movement.

The association was formed as the North American Baptist Association in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1950, when it broke with the American Baptist Association over church representation matters. The Baptist Missionary Association of America adopted its current name in 1969. The majority of BMAA churches are concentrated in the Southern United States, but the association has churches across the United States and supports missions throughout the world. Most churches participate in local and state associations as well as the national/general body. However, each state and local association is autonomous. there were 1,129 congregations in the United States.

The BMAA owns the Baptist Missionary Association Theological Seminary, with campuses in Jacksonville, Texas, Conway, Arkansas, and online. The association also operates Lifeword Media Ministries and DiscipleGuide Church Resources, located in Conway, Arkansas. The missions department offices are also located in Conway, Arkansas.

The 2022 BMAA national meeting passed resolutions defining the organization as pro-Christian Zionist, anti-Gay Rights, anti-euthanasia, and called for the election of more born-again Christians to public office.

<doc id="325961" wikidata="Q1430956" url="?curid=325961" title="Charlatan">
<text>A charlatan (also called a swindler or mountebank) is a person practicing quackery or a similar confidence trick in order to obtain money, power, fame, or other advantages through pretense or deception. One example of a charlatan appears in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; story &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale,&quot; with the Pardoner who tricks sinners into buying fake religious relics. Synonyms for &quot;charlatan&quot; include &quot;shyster&quot;, &quot;quack&quot;, or &quot;faker&quot;. &quot;Quack&quot; is a reference to &quot;quackery&quot; or the practice of dubious medicine, including the sale of snake oil, or a person who does not have medical training who purports to provide medical services.

==Etymology==
The English word comes from French &quot;,&quot; a seller of medicines who might advertise his presence with music and an outdoor stage show. The best known of the Parisian charlatans was Tabarin, whose skits and farces – which were influenced by &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; – inspired the 17th century playwright Molière. The word is also similar to Spanish &#x27;, an indiscreetly talkative person, a &quot;chatterbox&quot;. Etymologists trace &quot;charlatan&quot; ultimately from Italian, either from &#x27;, to chatter or prattle; or &quot;Cerretano&quot;, a resident of Cerreto, a village in Umbria, known for its quacks in the 16th century, or a mixture of both.

==Usage ==

A distinction is drawn between the charlatan and other kinds of confidence tricksters. The charlatan is usually a salesperson of a certain service or product, who has no personal relationship with his &quot;marks&quot; (customers or clients), and avoids elaborate hoaxes or roleplaying con-games. Rather, the person called a charlatan is being accused of resorting to quackery, pseudoscience, or other knowingly employed bogus means of impressing people in order to swindle victims by selling them worthless nostrums and similar goods or services that will not deliver on the promises made for them. One example of a charlatan is a 19th-century medicine show operator, who has long since left town by the time the people who bought his &quot;snake oil&quot; or similarly named &quot;cure-all&quot; tonic realize that it was a scam. A misdirection by a charlatan is a confuddle, a dropper is a leader of a group of conmen, and hangmen are conmen that present false checks. A gaff means to trick or con and a mugu is a victim of a rigged game.

In reported spiritual communications, a charlatan is a person who fakes evidence that a spirit is &quot;making contact&quot; with the medium and seekers. Notable people who have successfully debunked the claims of purported supernatural mediums include magician/scientific skeptic James Randi, Brazilian writer Monteiro Lobato and magician Harry Houdini.

<doc id="325963" wikidata="Q1429464" url="?curid=325963" title="Pollen tube">
<text>A pollen tube is a tubular structure produced by the male gametophyte of seed plants when it germinates. Pollen tube elongation is an integral stage in the plant life cycle. The pollen tube acts as a conduit to transport the male gamete cells from the pollen grain—either from the stigma (in flowering plants) to the ovules at the base of the pistil or directly through ovule tissue in some gymnosperms. In maize, this single cell can grow longer than to traverse the length of the pistil.

Pollen tubes were first discovered by Giovanni Battista Amici in the 19th century.

They are used as a model for understanding plant cell behavior. Research is ongoing to comprehend how the pollen tube responds to extracellular guidance signals to achieve fertilization.
Pollen tubes are unique to seed plants and their structures have evolved over their history since the Carboniferous period. Pollen tube formation is complex and the mechanism is not fully understood.

==Angiosperms==


The male reproductive organ of the flower, the stamen, produces pollen. The opening of anthers makes pollen available for subsequent pollination (transfer of pollen grains to the pistil, the female reproductive organ). Each pollen grain contains a vegetative cell, and a generative cell that divides to form two sperm cells. Abiotic vectors such as wind, water, or biotic vectors such as animals carry out the pollen distribution.

Once a pollen grain settles on a compatible pistil, it may germinate in response to a sugary fluid secreted by the mature stigma. Lipids at the surface of the stigma may also stimulate pollen tube growth for compatible pollen. Plants that are self-sterile often inhibit the pollen grains from their own flowers from growing pollen tubes. The presence of multiple grains of pollen has been observed to stimulate quicker pollen tube growth in some plants. The vegetative cell then produces the pollen tube, a tubular protrusion from the pollen grain, which carries the sperm cells within its cytoplasm. The sperm cells are the male gametes that will join with the egg cell and the central cell in double fertilization. The first fertilization event produces a diploid zygote and the second fertilization event produces a triploid endosperm.

The germinated pollen tube must drill its way through the nutrient-rich style and curl to the bottom of the ovary to reach an ovule. Once the pollen tube reaches an ovule, it bursts to deliver the two sperm cells. One of the sperm cells fertilizes the egg cell which develops into an embryo, which will become the future plant. The other one fuses with both polar nuclei of the central cell to form the endosperm, which serves as the embryo&#x27;s food supply. Finally, the ovary will develop into a fruit and the ovules will develop into seeds.

== Gymnosperms ==

Gymnosperm pollen is produced in microsporangia borne on the scales of the male cone or microstrobilus. In most species, the plants are wind-pollinated, and the pollen grains of conifers have air bladders that provide buoyancy in air currents. The grains are deposited in the micropyle of the ovule of a female cone or megastrobilus, where they mature for up to a year. In conifers and gnetophytes, the pollen germinate to produce a pollen tube that penetrates the megasporangium or nucellus carrying with it sperm nuclei that are transferred to the egg cell in the developing archegonia of the female plant.

== Mechanism of pollen tube growth ==

=== Recognition ===

The female sporophyte must recognize the pollen stuck to the stigma. Often, only pollen of the same species can successfully grow. Outcrossed pollen grows more successfully. With self-incompatibility systems, outcrossed pollen grows and outcompetes self pollen. The interaction between the style and the pollen detects compatibility and influences growth rate of the pollen tube. This selection process relies on gene level regulation in which gene loci of the gynoecium allow either self-pollen to grow slowly, stop growing or burst while faster growth of outcrossed pollen occurs. Self-incompatibility systems maintain genetic diversity. As for gymnosperms, they do not contain a pistil with a stigma. Therefore, pollen must submerge into the pollination droplet, bringing the male gametophyte to the egg of the exposed ovule. However, pollen of different species will not submerge into the droplet; the pollen is left floating on top, while the droplet retracts back into the micropyle.

=== Initiation ===

Once the pollen grain is recognized and hydrated, the pollen grain germinates to grow a pollen tube. There is competition in this step as many pollen grains may compete to reach the egg. The stigma plays a role in guiding the sperm to a receptive ovule, in the case of many ovules. Only compatible pollen grains are allowed to grow as determined by signaling with the stigma.

In the pollen grain, the generative cell gives rise to the sperm, whereas the vegetative cells have a tube cell that grows the pollen tube. Some plants have mechanisms in place to prevent self pollination, such as having stigma and anther mature at different times or being of different lengths, which significantly contributes to increasing genetic diversity of the next generation.

There is great variation in the rate of growth of pollen tubes and many studies have focused on signaling. The gene expression in the pollen grain has been identified as that of the gametophyte and not of the parental sporophyte, as it expresses its own unique mRNA and enzymes. In the peach tree, the style environment which the pollen tube grows through provides nutrition for the tube&#x27;s growth to the ovule. Pollen tubes are tolerant and even pollen damaged by X-rays and gamma rays can still grow pollen tubes.

=== Growth and signaling ===

Pollen tube growth is influenced by the interaction between the stigma-style and the pollen grain. The elongation of the tube is achieved with elongation of the cytoskeleton and it extends from the tip, which is regulated by high levels of calcium in the cytosol. The calcium levels help the synaptic vesicles in the membranes grow and extend at the tip. Polypeptides found in the style also regulate growth of tube and specific peptides that play a role in signaling for growth have been identified.

The LURE peptides that are secreted from the synergids, which occupy the space adjacent to the egg cell, can use attractants. In mutant Arabidopsis plant embryos, specifically in those without the synergids, the pollen tubes were unable to grow. Pollen tube growth is toward eggs of the same species as the pollen. Intraspecific signaling helps fertilize egg and sperm of the same species. The signaling in the style is important as pollen tubes can grow without the presence of an embryo sac with just interaction with the style. Other parts in the ovary include cytoplasmic factors like miRNA and chemical gradients that attract the pollen tube to grow toward the synergids.

Calcium and ethylene in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; were involved in termination of the pollen tube when it grows near the ovary. The increase in calcium allowed release of the two sperm cells from the tube as well as degeneration of a synergid cell. The chemical gradient of calcium can also contribute to termination early on in tube growth or at the appropriate time.

The length of the pollen tube varies by species. It grows in an oscillating fashion until it is ready to release the sperm near the egg for fertilization to take place. Some fast-growing pollen tubes have been observed in lily, tobacco, and &quot;Impatiens sultanii.&quot; The rate of growth confers advantage to the organism but it is not clear whether the variation in growth rate exists in the population or has been selected for over generations due to increased fitness.

=== Evolution ===
Many transitional features have been identified that show correlation between the evolution of the pollen tube with that of a non-motile sperm. Early seed plants like ferns have spores and motile sperm that swim in a water medium, called zooidogamy. The angiosperm pollen tube is simple, unbranched, and fast growing, however this is not the case for ancestral plants.

In gymnosperms like &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; and cycadophyta, a haustorial pollen tube forms. The tube simply soaks up nutrients from the female nucellus and grows in two stages. The pollen tube is highly branched and grows on the female sporophyte tissues. First, it grows the main tube followed by a more spherical tip at the end to allow the sperm to burst near the archegonia. The binucleated, multiflagellated sperm can then swim to the egg. Cycads have a less branched structured and the tip end swells the same way as in the ginkgo. In cycads, however, various enzymes have been identified in the pollen tube that direct growth and the nucellus tissues are more damaged with the tube growth.

In other phyla of gymnosperms, the Coniferophyta and Gnetophyta, the sperm is non motile, and the pollen tube delivers the sperm to the egg directly, in a process called siphonogamy. Conifers can be branched or unbranched and they cause degeneration of the female tissue as it grows through more tissue. Pines, for instance discharge cytoplasm of the sperm and union of the one sperm occurs as the other sperm degenerates. Yet, in Gnetophyta, there are features more similar to angiosperm pollen tubes where the tube reaches the egg with an early form of double fertilization. However, the endosperm does not form and the second fertilization is aborted.

In angiosperms, the mechanism has been studied more extensively as pollen tubes in flowering plants grow very fast through long styles to reach the well-protected egg. There is great variation in pollen tubes in angiosperms and many model plants like petunia, Arabidopsis, lily and tobacco plants have been studied for intraspecific variation and signaling mechanisms. In flowering plants, a phenomenon called polyamory can occur where many ovules are fertilized and overall fitness of the organism is yet to be studied with respect to rate of pollen tube growth.

==Behavior==

Pollen tubes are an excellent model for the understanding of plant cell behavior. They are easily cultivated in vitro and have a very dynamic cytoskeleton that polymerizes at very high rates, providing the pollen tube with interesting mechanical properties. The pollen tube has an unusual kind of growth; it extends exclusively at its apex. Extending the cell wall only at the tip minimizes friction between the tube and the invaded tissue. This tip growth is performed in a pulsating manner rather than in a steady fashion. The pollen tube&#x27;s journey through the style often results in depth-to-diameter ratios above 100:1 and up to 1000:1 in certain species. In maize, this single cell can grow longer than to traverse the length of the pistil. The internal machinery and the external interactions that govern the dynamics of pollen tube growth are far from being fully understood.

=== Role of actin cytoskeleton ===

The actin cytoskeleton has proven to be critical in assisting pollen tube growth. In terms of spatial distribution, actin filaments are arranged into three different structures within the pollen tube. Each unique arrangement, or pattern, contributes to the maintenance of polarized cell growth characteristic of the pollen tube. In the apical region - the site of tip-directed growth- actin filaments are less abundant, however they are highly dynamic. Furthermore, small vesicles accumulate in the apex, indicating that this region is the site of critical vesicle targeting and fusing events. Such events are essential for regulating the velocity and direction of pollen tube growth. In the subapical region, actin filaments are arranged into a collar-like structure. Reverse-fountain cytoplasmic streaming occurs at the subapex; the direction of cytoplasmic streaming is reversed and continues along the axial actin cables comprising the shank. The shank region comprises the central part of the pollen tube. In this region, actin filaments are arranged into axial bundles of uniform polarity, thereby enabling the transport of various organelles and vesicles from the base of the pollen tube to the tip, propelling overall tube growth.

=== Actin filament dynamics ===
Both the spatial distribution and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are regulated by actin-binding proteins (ABPs). In order to experimentally observe distributional changes that take place in the actin cytoskeleton during pollen tube growth, green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) have been put to use. GFPs were mainly selected for the purposes of dynamic visualization due to the fact that they provided an efficient means for the non-invasive imaging of actin filaments in plants. Amongst the various GFPs employed during experimentation were GFP-mTalin, LIM-GFP and GFP-fimbrin/ABD2-GFP. However, each of these markers either disrupted the natural structure of the actin filaments or unfavorably labeled such filaments. For example, GFP-mTalin resulted in excessive filament bundling and GFP-fimbrin/ABD2-GFP did not label actin filaments located in the apical or subapical regions of the pollen tube. In light of these drawbacks, Lifeact-mEGFP has been designated as the prominent marker of choice for actin filaments in the pollen tube; Lifeact-mEGFP is able to detect all three arrangements of actin filaments, and it has minimal effects on the natural structure of actin filaments. Lifeact-mEGFP has been used as a marker to study the dynamics of actin filaments in the growing pollen tubes of tobacco, lilies and Arabidopsis.

Through studies conducted with GFP, it has been confirmed that the dynamic state of actin filaments located in the apical region are essential for pollen tube growth. Experimentation of actin filaments stained with GFP-mTalin have yielded results confirming that tip-localized actin filaments are highly dynamic. Such experimentation has made a connection between the dynamics of tip-localized actin filaments and their role in the formation of actin structures in the subapical region. Furthermore, experimentation of actin filaments located in the apical dome of Arabidopsis indicates that actin filaments are continuously produced from the apical membrane of the pollen tube; the production of these actin filaments are mediated by formins. These findings have provided evidence supporting the theory that actin filaments located in the apical region are highly dynamic and are the site of vesicle targeting and fusing events. Experimentation of etiolated hypocotyl cells as well as BY-2 suspension cells show that highly dynamic actin filaments produced from the apical membrane can either be turned over by filament severing and depolarizing events, or they can move from the apex to the apical flank, resulting in decreased accumulation of actin filaments in the apical region of the pollen tube.

Experimentation of actin filament dynamics in the shank region were also conducted with the use of GFP. Findings indicated that maximum filament length in this region significantly increased, and the severing frequency significantly decreased. Such findings indicate that actin filaments located in the shank region are relatively stable compared to actin filaments located in the apical and subapical regions.

=== Regulation ===
ABPs regulate the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. As stated previously, actin filaments are continuously synthesized from the apical membrane. This indicates the presence of membrane-anchored actin nucleation factors. Through experimentation, it has been theorized that formins are representative of such actin nucleation factors. For example, formin AtFH5 has been identified as a major regulator of actin filament nucleation, specifically for actin filaments synthesized from the apical membrane of the pollen tube. Genetic knockouts of AtFH5 resulted in a decreased abundance of actin filaments in both apical and subapical regions of the pollen tube, thereby providing more evidence to support the theory that AtFH5 nucleates actin filament assembly in apical and subapical regions of the pollen tube.

Class I formin AtFH3 is another actin nucleation factor. AtFH3 nucleates actin filament assembly of the longitudinal actin cables located in the shank region of the pollen tube. More specifically, AtFH3 uses the actin/profilin complex in order to interact with the end of actin filaments, thereby initiating actin filament nucleation.

===Guidance===

Extensive work has been dedicated to comprehend how the pollen tube responds to extracellular guidance signals to achieve fertilization. Pollen tubes react to a combination of chemical, electrical, and mechanical cues during their journey through the pistil. However, it is not clear how these external cues work or how they are processed internally. Moreover, sensory receptors for any external cue have not been identified yet. Nevertheless, several aspects have already been identified as central in the process of pollen tube growth. The actin filaments in the cytoskeleton, the peculiar cell wall, secretory vesicle dynamics, and the flux of ions, to name a few, are some of the fundamental features readily identified as crucial, but whose role has not yet been completely elucidated.

===DNA repair===

During pollen tube growth, DNA damages that arise need to be repaired in order for the male genomic information to be transmitted intact to the next generation. In the plant &quot;Cyrtanthus mackenii&quot;, bicellular mature pollen contains a generative cell and a vegetative cell. Sperm cells are derived by mitosis of the generative cell during pollen tube elongation. The vegetative cell is responsible for pollen tube development. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise appear to be efficiently repaired in the generative cell, but not in the vegetative cell, during the transport process to the female gametophyte.

== RMD Actin filament organization is a contributor to pollen tube growth ==

=== Overview ===
In order for fertilization to occur, there is rapid tip growth in pollen tubes which delivers the male gametes into the ovules. A pollen tube consists of three different regions: the apex which is the growth region, the subapex which is the transition region, and the shank which acts like normal plant cells with the specific organelles. The apex region is where tip growth occurs and requires the fusion of secretory vesicles. There is mostly pectin and homogalacturonans (part of the cell wall at the pollen tube tip) inside these vesicles. The pectin in the apex region contains methylesters which allow for flexibility, before the enzyme pectin methylesterase removes the methylester groups allowing calcium to bind between pectins and give structural support. The homogalacturonans accumulate in the apex region via exocytosis in order to loosen the cell wall. A thicker and softer tip wall with a lower stress yield will form and this allows cell expansion to occur, which leads to an increase in tip growth. Reverse-fountain cytoplasmic streaming occurs during the tip growth which is essential for the cellular expansion, because it is transporting organelles and vesicles between the shank region and subapex region.

The actin cytoskeleton is an important factor in pollen tube growth, because there are different patterns of actin cytoskeleton within the different regions of the pollen tube for the maintenance of polarized cell growth. For instance, there are longitudinal actin cables in the shank region in order to regulate reverse-fountain cytoplasmic streaming. The F-actin controls the accumulation of the homogalacturonans full vesicles- essentially mediating tip growth- in the subapex region. The actin filaments controls the apical membrane and cytoplasm interactions while the pollen tube is growing in the apex region. The F-actin from the apical membrane makes an actin binding protein called formin which is essential for pollen tube tip growth. Formins are expressed in the tip growth cells and are divided into two subgroups: type I and type II. The type I formins make the actin structures and partake in cytokinesis. The type II formins on the other hand contribute to the growth of polarized cells which is necessary for tip growth. Tip growth is a form of extreme polarized growth and this polarized process requires actin-binding protein-mediated organization of actin cytoskeleton. An essential protein required for this tip growth is the actin-organizing protein and type II formin protein called Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD). RMD is localized in the tip of the pollen tube and controls pollen tube growth by regulating the polarity and organization of F-actin array.

=== RMD promotes pollen tube growth ===
RMD promotes pollen germination and pollen tube growth, and this is proven through numerous experiments. The first experiment compares the features of the pistil and the stigma of rmd-1 mutant (rice plant without a functional RMD) and the wild-type rice plant (with a functional RMD). The anther and pistil were shorter in the rmd-1 mutants than the wild-type. This experiment showed that RMD is critical for pollen development. Wild-type rice plants have increased germination rates while rmd-1 mutants have decreased germination rates. This was seen when both were germinated in a liquid germination medium. After the germination rates were tested, there was a comparison of the lengths and widths of the pollen tubes between the two plants. The pollen tubes of the wild-type plants had a greater pollen tube length than the mutants, but the mutants had a greater tube width. This greater pollen tube width within the mutants indicates the decrease in the growth of polarized cells and thus decrease in tip growth. Next, pollen grains from the wild type and mutants were collected to compare the pollination activities between the wild types and mutants. There was decreased activity and minimal penetration within the mutants whereas an increased activity and penetration through the style and to the bottom of the pistils within the wild types. These observations indicated the delayed pollen tube growth in the rmd-1 mutants. Additionally, there was no effect on fertilization rates between the wild type and the mutant and this was tested by measuring the seed-setting rates between the wild type and mutant. It was found that both had similar seed-setting rates. Therefore, RMD does not affect fertilization and has an effect only on tip growth.

=== RMD expression in the pollen tube ===
Total RNA extractions from the whole flower, lemma, palea, lodicule, pistil, anther, and mature pollen grains of the wild type plants took place in order to discover where RMD is specifically expressed in the plant as a whole. Using RT-qPCR (reverse transcription quantitative PCR), it was evident that there were different amounts of RMD transcripts within each part of the plant. And then it was evident where RMD was present in each part of the plant using RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR) and using UBIQUITIN as a control. These two methods demonstrated that there was an abundant presence of the RMD transcripts in the lemma, pistil, anther, and mature pollen grains. In order to confirm these results, another method was performed. This method used transgenic plants that had an RMD promoter region fused with a reporter gene encoding GUS. Histochemical staining of the tissues of these transgenic plants then showed high GUS activity within the pistil, anther wall, and mature pollen grains. Therefore, these combined results demonstrated that RMD is expressed in these specific organs of the plant.

Detection of GUS signals were employed once again in order to study where RMD is specifically expressed within the pollen tube. First, pollen grains were collected from proRMD::GUS trangenic plants, and it was noted that there was a strong GUS signal within these mature pollen grains. These pollen grains were then germinated in vitro and GUS signals were observed within the tip growth of the pollen tubes. However, the strength of these GUS signals varied at different germination stages. The GUS signals were weak within the pollen tube tip at the early germination stage, but stronger at the later germination stages. Therefore, these results support that RMD is involved in pollen germination and pollen tube growth.

=== RMD localization in the pollen tube ===
RMD, which are type II formins, consist of a phosphatase, (PTEN)-like domain (responsible for protein localization), and FH1 and FH2 domains (promotes actin polymerization). In order to discover the localization of RMD in the pollen tube, transient assays of growing pollen tubes of tobacco was performed and the fluorescent protein-GFP was used. Many confocal images of various pollen tubes under specific conditions were observed: pLat52::eGFP (single eGFP driven by the pollen specific Lat52 promoter and this acts as a control); pLat52::RMD-eGFP (RMD protein fused with eGFP); pLat52::PTEN-eGFP (the PTEN domain fused with eGFP); and pLat52::FH1FH2-eGFP (the FH1 and FH2 domains fused with eGFP). By comparing the images of the control with pLat52::RMD-eGFP, it is observed that the single GFP was spread throughout the entire tube whereas RMD-eGFP accumulated in the tip region of the tube. Therefore, this shows that RMD is localized within the tip of the pollen tube.

In order to discover whether the PTEN-like domain is responsible for the localization of RMD, there was a comparison between the confocal images of GFP fused with PTEN domain and shortened RMD without the PTEN domain (pLat52::FH1FH2-eGFP). The PTEN-eGFP signals were localized in the tip of the pollen tubes like the RMD-eGFP signals, whereas the FH1FH2-eGFP signals were present throughout the pollen tube and not localized in a polar manner. Therefore, these combined results demonstrate that the PTEN-like domain is responsible for the tip localization of RMD in the pollen tubes.

=== RMD controls F-Actin distribution and polarity in the pollen tube ===
In order to determine if RMD controls F-actin organization within the pollen tube, F-actin arrays in wild type and rmd-1 mature pollen grains were observed using Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin staining. Strongly bundled actin filaments were present around the apertures of the wild type pollen grains although there was no accumulation of actin filaments around the apertures in the rmd-1 pollen grains. Additionally, there were weak signals and random organization of the actin filaments within the rmd-1 pollen grain. Therefore, these results support that RMD is essential for controlling pollen germination.

Fluorescent intensity was measured using statistical analysis in order to observe the actin filament densities within the pollen tubes. There was greater fluorescence intensity in the shank region of the rmd-mutant tubes which means there was a higher density of F-actin within this region. But, there was a lower density of F-actin observed in the tip region of the rmd-mutant tubes compared to the wild type tubes. This demonstrates that the F-actin distribution pattern of pollen tubes is altered without a functional RMD.

In order to determine the polarity of the actin cables, the angles between the actin cables and elongation axis of the pollen tube were measured. The angles in the shank region of the wild type pollen tubes were predominantly less than 20° whereas the angles for the rmd-mutant pollen tubes were greater than 60°. These results support the fact that RMD is essential for polarized tip growth, because the rmd-mutant pollen tubes (without a functional RMD) exhibited an increased width, and thus a decrease in tip growth. The maximum length of the single cables of F-actin filaments from the apical to the shank region of elongating pollen tubes were also measured to test the polarity within the pollen tube. The maximum length of the F-actin cables were shorter in the rmd-mutant pollen tubes compared to those in the wild type tubes. Therefore, these combined results support that the proper organization of actin cables as well as normal F-actin densities within the tip of the tube can only be achieved if RMD is present.

<text>Wah Yan College Kowloon (WYK; ; demonym: &quot;Wahyanite&quot;, pl.: &quot;Wahyanites&quot;) is a Catholic secondary school for boys run by the Chinese Province of the Society of Jesus. It is located in Kowloon, Hong Kong, and is a grant-in-aid secondary school using English as the primary medium of instruction. The total land area of its campus is among the largest for Hong Kong secondary schools, and it&#x27;s one of the most prestigious schools in Hong Kong.

==History==
===Formative years===
Established on 1 December 1924 as a branch of Wah Yan College, Hong Kong, by Mr. Peter Tsui Yan Sau (徐仁壽, formerly a teacher at St. Joseph&#x27;s College), Wah Yan College Kowloon is one of the oldest and most prestigious secondary schools in Hong Kong, and was the first English-speaking college to be administered by local Chinese. During the 1930s, Mr. Tsui, himself a devout Catholic, saw the need of the pupils for greater spiritual guidance, and decided to gradually hand over the administration to the incoming Jesuits who were looking to serve in some local educational establishments. Besides the two Wah Yan Colleges, the Jesuits also sought to form a Catholic University in Hong Kong. But with the University of Hong Kong already established in 1911, the Jesuit fathers turned to organizing a Catholic hostel for its male students, which became Ricci Hall of the university. Mr. Tsui left Hong Kong and became a successful rubber planter and hotelier in Kota Kinabalu, British North Borneo (now Sabah, Malaysia). He died in Hong Kong on 19 February 1981, at the age of ninety three.

===Pre-war developments===
Before the Second World War, the school was located on Portland Street and then moved to Nelson Street in 1928. Under the auspices of A. E. Wood, Secretary for Education, the school was added to the Grant List and hence under Government subsidies. A satellite campus was opened at 103 Austin Road to cater to students in senior year. The premises became Tak Sun Primary School after the war. A South China Morning Post article in 1928 reported WYK to be the largest school in Hong Kong with a student population of 500. Despite new facilities, however, seniors had to cross Victoria Harbour for laboratory lessons at the Wah Yan College, Hong Kong.

In 1941 when Hong Kong was attacked by the Japanese forces, the Jesuits of the college helped organise the evacuation of the Kowloon civilians to the Island as they closed down the school. During the occupation, the Japanese prohibited its resumption on political grounds. The Nelson Street campus was so thoroughly looted that Mr. Chow Ching-nam (周淸霖), then Principal, could only salvage a small portion of school registers and documents, and the students had to bring in their own chairs when the college reopened after the war.

===Expansion and maturity===
Around 1947, the school authorities began the search for a new campus as its enrolment further increased. A proposed acquisition of a site on Ho Man Tin Hill Road was turned down. After negotiations with the Government of Hong Kong, a piece of former paddy field was granted and it moved to the current premises on Waterloo Road in 1952. This portion of land was large by Hong Kong standards, making WYK one of the largest campus in the urban Hong Kong area. This precedent was soon followed in the case of land provision for the Hong Kong campus, where the plot granted by the Government was also of significant size. The present campus was opened by the then Governor Sir Alexander Grantham in 1953. In 2005 a new annex of WYK was opened providing new science labs, a music room, a computer-assisted learning (CAL) room, and a student activity room.

Also in the campus is the St. Ignatius Chapel, under the parish of St. Teresa&#x27;s Church. Fr Stephen Law is the rector.

Mr. Laurence Tam (譚志成), an arts teacher during the late 1960s, pioneered a new Chinese ink painting movement which he integrated in his curriculum experimentally. He left the school to work as a curator at the Hong Kong Museum of Art in 1971.

The school hymn of Wah Yan College Kowloon is &quot;Our Captain and Our King&quot;. The origin of the hymn is unclear, but it is believed to have originated from Northern England back in the 18th century.

<text>The swamp eels (also written &quot;swamp-eels&quot;) are a family (Synbranchidae) of freshwater eel-like fishes of the tropics and subtropics. Most species are able to breathe air and typically live in marshes, ponds and damp places, sometimes burying themselves in the mud if the water source dries up. They have various adaptations to suit this lifestyle; they are long and slender, they lack pectoral and pelvic fins, and their dorsal and anal fins are vestigial, making them limbless vertebrates. They lack scales and a swimbladder, and their gills open on the throat in a slit or pore. Oxygen can be absorbed through the lining of the mouth and pharynx, which is rich in blood vessels and acts as a &quot;lung&quot;.

Although adult swamp eels have virtually no fins, the larvae have large pectoral fins which they use to fan water over their bodies, thus ensuring gas exchange before their adult breathing apparatus develops. When about a fortnight old they shed these fins and assume the adult form. Most species of swamp eel are hermaphrodite, starting life as females and later changing to males, though some individuals start life as males and do not change sex.

In the Jiangnan region of China, swamp eels are eaten as a delicacy, usually cooked as part of a stir-fry or casserole.

It is known as Kusia (কুচিয়া) in Assam and Bangladesh. It is considered a delicacy and cooked with curry as part of Assamese cuisine.

==Description==

The marbled swamp eel, &quot;Synbranchus marmoratus&quot;, has been recorded at up to in length, while the Bombay swamp eel, &quot;Monopterus indicus&quot;, reaches no more than .

Swamp eels are almost entirely finless; the pectoral and pelvic fins are absent, the dorsal and anal fins are vestigial, reduced to rayless ridges, and the caudal fin ranges from small to absent, depending on species. Almost all of the species lack scales. The eyes are small, and in some cave-dwelling species, they are beneath the skin, so the fish is blind. The gill membranes are fused, and the gill opening is either a slit or pore underneath the throat. The swim bladder and ribs are also absent. These are all believed to be adaptations for burrowing into soft mud during periods of drought, and swamp eels are often found in the mud underneath a dried-up pond.

Most of the species can breathe air, allowing them to survive in low-oxygenated water, and to migrate overland between ponds on wet nights. The linings of the mouth and pharynx are highly vascularised, acting as primitive but efficient lungs. Although swamp eels are not themselves related to amphibians, this lifestyle may well resemble those of the fish from which the land animals evolved during the Devonian period.

Although the adults are virtually finless, the larvae are born with greatly enlarged pectoral fins. The fins are used to propel streams of oxygenated water from the surface along the larva&#x27;s body. The skin of the larva is thin and vascularised, allowing it to extract oxygen from this stream of water. As the fish grows, the adult air-breathing organ begins to develop, and it no longer requires the fins. At the age of about two weeks, the larva suddenly sheds the pectoral fins, and takes on the adult form.

Most species are protogynous hermaphrodites, that is, most individuals begin life as females, but later change into males. This typically occurs around four years of age, although a small number of individuals are born male and remain so throughout their lives.

==Taxonomy==
The family Synbranchidae is divided into six genera as follows:

* genus &quot;Macrotrema&quot; 
* genus &quot;Ophisternon&quot; 
* genus &quot;Synbranchus&quot; 
* genus &quot;Monopterus&quot; 
* genus &quot;Rakthamichthys&quot; 
* genus &quot;Typhlosynbranchus&quot; 

==In cooking==

In Indonesia swamp eel is called &quot;belut&quot;, and are commonly harvested from water ponds of rice paddies and become the protein source for rural population in Indonesia. Swamp eel is usually stir fried served with sambal hot chili sauce as &quot;belut penyet&quot;, curried, or deep fried to achieve crispy texture as &quot;kripik belut&quot;.

In the Jiangnan region of China, swamp eels are a delicacy, usually cooked in stirfries or casseroles. The recipe usually calls for garlic, scallions, bamboo shoots, rice wine, sugar, starch, and soy sauce with prodigious amounts of vegetable oil. It is popular in the region from Shanghai to Nanjing. The Chinese name in pinyin of this dish is . The name of the swamp eel is &#x27; or &#x27;.

In Assam swamp eels are considered a delicacy and prepared as curry or dry fry. It is believed there that these are good source of iron and good for blood deficiency.

== Conservation status ==
As of 2021, eleven species were listed by the IUCN as species of special concern: &quot;Typhlosynbranchus boueti&quot; (Liberian swamp eel), &quot;Rakthamichthys indicus&quot; (Malabar swamp eel), &quot;Rakthamichthys roseni&quot;, &quot;Rakthamichthys digressus&quot;, and &quot;Ophichthys hodgarti&quot; have been classified as data deficient, meaning that they require more study to determine their conservation status. &quot;Ophichthys indicus&quot; (Bombay swamp eel) is classified as vulnerable. &quot;Ophichthys fossorius&quot; (Malabar swampeel), &quot;Ophisternon infernale&quot; (blind swamp eel), &quot;Ophisternon candidum&quot; (the blind cave eel), and &quot;Ophisternon afrum&quot; (Guinea swamp eel) are classified as endangered. &quot;Ophichthys desilvai&quot; (Desilvai&#x27;s blind eel) is classified as critically endangered.

On the other side of the endangerment issue, invasive swamp eels in Florida are a major threat to populations of crayfish and some other small species.
