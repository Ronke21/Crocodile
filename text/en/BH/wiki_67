<text>John Maxwell Coetzee FRSL OMG (born 9 February 1940) is a South African and Australian novelist, essayist, linguist, translator and recipient of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. He is one of the most critically acclaimed and decorated authors in the English language. He has won the Booker Prize (twice), the CNA Literary Award (thrice), the Jerusalem Prize, the Prix Femina étranger, and &quot;The Irish Times&quot; International Fiction Prize, and holds a number of other awards and honorary doctorates.

Coetzee moved to Australia in 2002 and became an Australian citizen in 2006. He lives in Adelaide, South Australia. He is patron of the J. M. Coetzee Centre for Creative Practice at the University of Adelaide. His most recently published book is &quot;The Pole and Other Stories&quot; (2023).

==Early life and education==

Coetzee was born in Cape Town, Cape Province, Union of South Africa, on 9 February 1940 to Afrikaner parents. His father, Zacharias Coetzee (1912–1988), was an occasional attorney and government employee, and his mother, Vera Coetzee (née Wehmeyer; 1904–1986), a schoolteacher. His father was often absent, and enlisted in the army and fought in World War II to avoid being prosecuted on a criminal charge. Vera and her children therefore relied on financial and other support from relatives. The family mainly spoke English at home, but Coetzee spoke Afrikaans with other relatives.

He is descended from 17th-century Dutch immigrants to South Africa, on his father&#x27;s side, and from Dutch, German, and Polish immigrants through his mother. His mother&#x27;s grandfather was a Pole, referred to by the Germanised form, Balthazar du Biel, but actually born Balcer Dubiel in 1844 in the village of Czarnylas (Schwarzwald), in a part of Poland annexed by Prussia. His ancestry caused a lifelong preoccupation with Polish literature and culture, culminating in his 2022 novel &quot;The Pole&quot;.

Coetzee spent most of his early life in Cape Town and in Worcester, a town in the Cape Province (modern-day Western Cape), as recounted in his fictionalised memoir, &quot;&quot; (1997). His family moved to Worcester when he was eight, after his father lost his government job. Coetzee attended St. Joseph&#x27;s College, a Catholic school in the Cape Town suburb Rondebosch. He studied mathematics and English at the University of Cape Town (UCT), receiving a Bachelor of Arts with honours in English in 1960 and a Bachelor of Arts with honours in mathematics in 1961.

Coetzee moved to the United Kingdom in 1962 and worked as a computer programmer for IBM in London and ICT (International Computers and Tabulators) in Bracknell, staying until 1965. His experiences in England are recounted in &quot;&quot; (2002), his second volume of fictionalised memoirs.

In 1963, the University of Cape Town awarded Coetzee a Master of Arts degree for his thesis &quot;The Works of Ford Madox Ford with Particular Reference to the Novels&quot; (1963).

==Academia==

=== United States ===

In 1965, Coetzee went to the University of Texas at Austin in the United States and enrolled in bibliography and Old English courses. While there, he taught students at the university, and also wrote a paper on the morphology of the Nama, Malay, and Dutch languages for linguist Archibald A. Hill, who taught at the university. His PhD dissertation was a computer-aided stylistic analysis of the English prose of Samuel Beckett. After leaving Texas in 1968, he was awarded his doctorate in 1969.

In 1968, Coetzee began teaching English literature at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he stayed until 1971. At Buffalo, he began his first novel, &quot;Dusklands&quot;.

From as early as 1968, Coetzee sought permanent residence in the U.S., a process that was finally unsuccessful, in part due to his involvement in protests against the war in Vietnam. In March 1970, he was one of 45 faculty members who occupied the university&#x27;s Hayes Hall and were arrested for criminal trespass. The charges against them were dropped in 1971.

=== University of Cape Town ===

In 1972, Coetzee returned to South Africa and was appointed lecturer in the Department of English Language and Literature at the University of Cape Town. He was promoted to senior lecturer and associate professor before becoming Professor of General Literature in 1984. In 1994 Coetzee became Arderne Professor in English, and in 1999 he was appointed Distinguished Professor in the Faculty of Humanities. Upon retirement in 2002, he was awarded emeritus status.

He served on the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago until 2003.

=== Adelaide ===

After relocating to Adelaide, Australia, Coetzee was made an honorary research fellow at the English Department of the University of Adelaide, where his partner, Dorothy Driver, is a fellow academic. , Coetzee is listed as University Professorial Research Fellow within the School of Humanities

==Writing career==

Coetzee&#x27;s first novel was &quot;Dusklands&quot; (1974), and he has published a novel about every three years since. He has also written autobiographical novels, short fiction, translations from Dutch and Afrikaans, and numerous essays and works of criticism. His latest work is &quot;The Pole and Other Stories&quot; (2023). He has not written a novel set in South Africa since 2009.

According to James Meek, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2009: &quot;Since &quot;Disgrace&quot;, the nature of Coetzee&#x27;s project has changed. He has moved away from naturalistic, storytelling fiction towards other forms—essays, polemic and memoir, or a composite of all three in a fictional framework... [he] seems to be taking less interest in the storytelling keel of his books and is inviting us instead to listen in to an intimate conversation he is having with himself, in the form of multiple alter egos&quot;. These alter egos include a character type represented by the magistrate in &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; and David Lurie in &quot;Disgrace&quot;; another is a female proxy for himself, the &quot;elderly, scholarly, world-weary novelist&quot; Elizabeth Costello, a recurring character in his works; and the last is Coetzee himself, writing autobiographically. Meek also remarks that Coetzee is harsh on himself, in the characters who represent him in some ways.

Relating to his developing interest in Argentine literature in the 2010s, Coetzee&#x27;s trilogy of novels &quot;The Childhood of Jesus&quot;, &quot;The Schooldays of Jesus&quot;, and &quot;The Death of Jesus&quot; reflect his preoccupation with and evolution of his ideas and views on language (&quot;I do not like the way in which English is taking over the world... I don&#x27;t like the arrogance that this situation breeds in its native speakers. Therefore, I do what little I can to resist the hegemony of the English language&quot;). All three were translated into Spanish, with the last published in Spanish translation first. He also became involved with the Literatures of the South project during this period (2015).

&quot;The Pole&quot; was first published in Spanish as &quot;El polaco&quot;, in Argentina, in 2022, and in English the next year.

==Awards, recognition, appearances==

Coetzee is one of the most critically acclaimed and decorated authors in the English language. He has received numerous awards throughout his career, although he has a reputation for avoiding award ceremonies.

===1983 and 1999 Booker Prizes===

Coetzee was the first writer to be awarded the Booker Prize twice: for &quot;Life &amp; Times of Michael K&quot; in 1983, and for &quot;Disgrace&quot; in 1999. , three other authors have achieved this, Peter Carey, Hilary Mantel, and Margaret Atwood.

&quot;Summertime&quot;, named on the 2009 longlist, was an early favourite to win Coetzee an unprecedented third Booker Prize. It made the shortlist, but lost to bookmakers&#x27; favourite &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, by Mantel. Coetzee was also longlisted in 2003 for &quot;Elizabeth Costello&quot; and in 2005 for &quot;Slow Man&quot;.

&quot;The Schooldays of Jesus&quot;, a follow-up to his 2013 novel &quot;The Childhood of Jesus&quot;, was longlisted for the 2016 Booker Prize.

===2003 Nobel Prize in Literature===

On 2 October 2003, the Swedish Academy announced that Coetzee had been chosen as that year&#x27;s recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the fourth African writer to be so honoured and the second South African, after Nadine Gordimer. When awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy stated that Coetzee &quot;in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider&quot;. The press release for the award also cited his &quot;well-crafted composition, pregnant dialogue and analytical brilliance&quot;, while focusing on the moral nature of his work. The prize ceremony was held in Stockholm on 10 December 2003.

===Other awards and recognition===

Coetzee is a three-time winner of South Africa&#x27;s CNA Literary Award (in 1977, 1980 and 1983). His &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; received both the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, &quot;Age of Iron&quot; was awarded the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; Book of the Year award, and &quot;The Master of Petersburg&quot; was awarded &quot;The Irish Times&quot; International Fiction Prize in 1995. He has also won the French Prix Femina étranger and two Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prizes for the African region, for &quot;Master of St Petersburg&quot; in 1995 and for &quot;Disgrace&quot; in 2000 (the latter personally presented by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace), and the 1987 Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society. In 1998, he received the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction.

In 1984, Coetzee received an Honorary Fellow Award at the University of Cape Town. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL) in 1988. In 2001 he won the Outstanding Alumnus award at the University of Texas. In 2004, he was made Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.

On 27 September 2005, the South African government awarded Coetzee the Order of Mapungubwe (gold class) for his &quot;exceptional contribution in the field of literature and for putting South Africa on the world stage&quot;. In 2006, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He holds honorary doctorates from The American University of Paris (2010), the University of Adelaide (2005), La Trobe University, the University of Natal (1996), the University of Oxford, Rhodes University, the State University of New York at Buffalo, the University of Strathclyde, the University of Technology, Sydney, the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, and the Universidad Iberoamericana.

In 2013, Richard Poplak of the &quot;Daily Maverick&quot; called Coetzee &quot;inarguably the most celebrated and decorated living English-language author&quot;.

====Adelaide====

Coetzee first visited Adelaide in 1996, when he was invited to appear at Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week. He made subsequent appearances at the festival in 2004, 2010 (when he introduced Geoff Dyer), and 2019 (when he introduced Marlene van Niekerk).

In 2004, the Lord Mayor of Adelaide handed Coetzee the keys to the city.

In 2010, Coetzee was made an international ambassador for Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week, along with American novelist Susanna Moore and English poet Michael Hulse.

Coetzee is patron of the J. M. Coetzee Centre for Creative Practice (JMCCCP), a research centre and cultural hub founded at the University of Adelaide in 2015. The centre runs workshops with the aim of providing &quot;a stimulating environment for emerging and established writers, scholars and musicians&quot;. Coetzee&#x27;s work provides particular inspiration to encourage engagement with social and political issues, as well as music. The centre was established in 2015.

In November 2014, Coetzee was honoured with a three-day academic conference, &quot;JM Coetzee in the World&quot;, in Adelaide. It was called &quot;the culmination of an enormous collaborative effort and the first event of its kind in Australia&quot; and &quot;a reflection of the deep esteem in which John Coetzee is held by Australian academia&quot;.

From 9 to 10 November 2023, a celebration of Nobel Prize in Literature anniversaries, commemorating the winning of the prize by Coetzee in 2003 and Patrick White in 1973, was organised by the head of JMCCCP, Anne Pender, and held by the University of Adelaide. The program included several events over two days, including readings in the reading room of the Barr Smith Library by Coetzee, Christos Tsiolkas, Patrick Flanery, Helen Garner, Brian Castro, and others; music by Anna Goldsworthy and Paul Grabowsky; and screenings of &quot;Disgrace&quot; and &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot;, which included talks by the filmmakers, at the Palace Nova Eastend Cinema.

==Views==

===South Africa===

According to Fred Pfeil, Coetzee, André Brink and Breyten Breytenbach were at &quot;the forefront of the anti-apartheid movement within Afrikaner literature and letters&quot;. On accepting the Jerusalem Prize in 1987, Coetzee spoke of the limitations of art in South African society, whose structures had resulted in &quot;deformed and stunted relations between human beings&quot; and &quot;a deformed and stunted inner life&quot;. He added, &quot;South African literature is a literature in bondage. It is a less than fully human literature. It is exactly the kind of literature you would expect people to write from prison&quot;, and called on the South African government to abandon its apartheid policy. The scholar Isidore Diala wrote that Coetzee, Nadine Gordimer, and Brink are &quot;three of South Africa&#x27;s most distinguished white writers, all with definite anti-apartheid commitment&quot;.

It has been argued that Coetzee&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Disgrace&quot; allegorises South Africa&#x27;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Asked about his views on the TRC, Coetzee said, &quot;In a state with no official religion, the TRC was somewhat anomalous: a court of a certain kind based to a large degree on Christian teaching and on a strand of Christian teaching accepted in their hearts by only a tiny proportion of the citizenry. Only the future will tell what the TRC managed to achieve&quot;.

After his Australian citizenship ceremony, Coetzee said: &quot;I did not so much leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because from the time of my first visit in 1991, I was attracted by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and—when I first saw Adelaide—by the grace of the city that I now have the honour of calling my home.&quot; When he moved to Australia, Coetzee cited the South African government&#x27;s lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who said, &quot;South Africa is not only a place of rape&quot;, referencing Coetzee&#x27;s &quot;Disgrace&quot;. In 1999, the African National Congress&#x27;s submission to a South African Human Rights Commission investigation into racism in the media said that &quot;Disgrace&quot; depicted racist stereotypes. When Coetzee won the Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him &quot;on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa&quot;.

===Politics===

Coetzee has never specified any political orientation nor overtly criticised apartheid, though he has alluded to politics in his work, especially the part that language plays in supporting the political and social structures of colonialism and nationalism. South African author Nadine Gordimer suggested that Coetzee had &quot;a revulsion against all political and revolutionary solutions&quot;, and he has been both praised for his condemnation of racism in his writing and criticised for not explicitly denouncing apartheid.

Writing about his past in the third person, Coetzee wrote in &quot;Doubling the Point&quot;:
Asked about the latter part of this quote in an interview, Coetzee answered: &quot;There is no longer a left worth speaking of, and a language of the left. The language of politics, with its new economistic bent, is even more repellent than it was 15 years ago&quot;.

In February 2016, Coetzee was one of 61 signatories to a letter to Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and immigration minister Peter Dutton condemning their government&#x27;s policy of offshore detention of asylum seekers.

===Law===

In 2005, Coetzee criticised contemporary anti-terrorism laws as resembling those of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime: &quot;I used to think that the people who created [South Africa&#x27;s] laws that effectively suspended the rule of law were moral barbarians. Now I know they were just pioneers ahead of their time.&quot; The main character in Coetzee&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Diary of a Bad Year&quot;, which has been described as blending &quot;memoir with fiction, academic criticism with novelistic narration&quot; and refusing &quot;to recognize the border that has traditionally separated political theory from fictional narrative&quot;, shares similar concerns about the policies of John Howard and George W. Bush.

===Animals===

In recent years, Coetzee has become a vocal critic of cruelty to animals and an advocate of animal rights. In a speech given on his behalf by Hugo Weaving in Sydney on 22 February 2007, Coetzee railed against the modern animal husbandry industry. The speech was for Voiceless, an Australian nonprofit animal protection organization of which Coetzee became a patron in 2004. Coetzee&#x27;s fiction has similarly engaged with animal cruelty and animal welfare, especially &quot;The Lives of Animals&quot;, &quot;Disgrace&quot;, &quot;Elizabeth Costello&quot;, and &quot;The Old Woman and the Cats&quot;. He is a vegetarian.

In 2008, at the behest of John Banville, who alerted him to the matter, Coetzee wrote to &quot;The Irish Times&quot; of his opposition to Trinity College Dublin&#x27;s use of vivisection on animals for scientific research. He wrote: &quot;I support the sentiments expressed by John Banville. There is no good reason—in fact, there has never been any good reason, scientific or pedagogical—to require students to cut up living animals. Trinity College brings shame on itself by continuing with the practice.&quot; Nearly nine years later, when TCD&#x27;s continued (and, indeed, increasing) practice of vivisection featured in the news, a listener to the RTÉ Radio 1 weekday afternoon show &quot;Liveline&quot; pointed out that Banville had previously raised the matter but been ignored. Banville then telephoned &quot;Liveline&quot; to call the practice &quot;absolutely disgraceful&quot; and recalled how his and Coetzee&#x27;s efforts to intervene had been to no avail: &quot;I was passing by the front gates of Trinity one day and there was a group of mostly young women protesting and I was interested. I went over and I spoke to them and they said that vivisection experiments were being carried out in the college. This was a great surprise to me and a great shock, so I wrote a letter of protest to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. Some lady professor from Trinity wrote back essentially saying Mr. Banville should stick to his books and leave us scientists to our valuable work.&quot; Asked if he received any other support for his stance in the letter he sent to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Banville replied, &quot;No. I became entirely dispirited and I thought, &#x27;Just shut up, John. Stay out of it because I&#x27;m not going to do any good&#x27;. If I had done any good I would have kept it on. I mean, I got John Coetzee—you know, the famous novelist J. M. Coetzee—I got him to write a letter to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. I asked a lot of people.&quot;

Coetzee wanted to be a candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election for the Dutch Party for the Animals, but the Dutch election board rejected his candidacy, arguing that candidates had to prove legal residence in the European Union.

===Literatures of the South===

In the early 1960s, while in London, Coetzee studied Spanish, and from 2015 to 2018, Coetzee was a director of a biannual seminar series on the Literatures of the South at the Universidad Nacional de San Martín in Argentina. This involved writers and literary figures from Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. The aim of the seminars, one observer remarked, was &quot;to develop comparative perspectives on the literature&quot; and journalism of the three areas, &quot;to establish new intellectual networks, and to build a corpus of translated works from across the South through collaborative publishing ventures&quot;. He developed an interest in Argentine literature, and curated a series for the publishing house El Hilo de Ariadna, which includes Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot;, Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Watt&quot;, and Patrick White&#x27;s &quot;The Solid Mandala&quot;. His trilogy of novels &quot;The Childhood of Jesus&quot;, &quot;The Schooldays of Jesus&quot;, and &quot;The Death of Jesus&quot; reflect his preoccupation and evolution of ideas and views on language.

At the same time, he was involved in a research project in Australia, Other Worlds: Forms of World Literature, for which he led a theme on &quot;Everyday Pleasures&quot; that is also focused on the literatures of the South. Coetzee chose to publish &quot;The Schooldays of Jesus&quot; and &quot;The Death of Jesus&quot; in Australia, and &quot;The Pole&quot; in Argentina, before they were published in the U.K. or the U.S. In an interview with &quot;El Pais&quot;, he said, &quot;the symbolism of publishing in the South before the North is important to me&quot;.

===Copyright/piracy===

When asked in 2015 to address unofficial Iranian translations of foreign works — Iran does not recognize international copyright agreements — Coetzee stated his disapproval of the practice on moral grounds and wished to have it sent to journalistic organisations in that country.

==Personal life==

===Non-literary activities===

Coetzee was a key figure in the establishment of Oak Tree Press&#x27;s &quot;First Chapter Series&quot; in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Oak Tree Fine Press raises funds for childrens HIV/AIDS charities 2022 j539&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The series produces limited-edition signed works by literary greats to raise money for the child victims and orphans of the African HIV/AIDS crisis.

===Personal identity and public image ===

Coetzee has mentioned a number of literary figures who, like him, have tried &quot;to transcend their national and historical contexts&quot;: Rainer Maria Rilke, Jorge Luis Borges, Samuel Beckett, James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Zbigniew Herbert—outsiders to Western culture who moved countries and/or wrote in different languages. He has said, &quot;as a child, as a young man, as a student, I had absolutely no doubt that access to the English language was liberating me from the narrow world view of the Afrikaner&quot;, and &quot;I have a good command of English, spoken and written, but more and more it feels to me like the kind of command that a foreigner might have&quot;. He has written about his feeling of being an &quot;outsider&quot;, such as his experience of being a colonial when living in London, which he writes about in &quot;Youth&quot;, and characters in his novels have sometimes been outsiders.

On 6 March 2006, Coetzee became an Australian citizen, and it has been argued that his &quot;acquired &#x27;Australianness&#x27; is deliberately adopted and stressed&quot; by Australians.

Coetzee is generally reluctant to speak about himself and his work, but has written about himself in several autobiographical novels (&quot;Boyhood&quot;, &quot;Youth&quot;, and &quot;Summertime&quot;). He has been described as reclusive, avoiding publicity to such an extent that he did not collect either of his two Booker Prizes in person. The South African writer Rian Malan, in oft-quoted words from an article published in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1999, called Coetzee &quot;a man of almost monkish self-discipline and dedication&quot;, and reported—based on hearsay—that he rarely laughed or even spoke. Asked about these comments in an email interview, Coetzee replied: &quot;I have met Rian Malan only once in my life. He does not know me and is not qualified to talk about my character&quot;.

===Family ===

Coetzee married Philippa Jubber in 1963. They divorced in 1980. They had a son, Nicolas (born 1966), and a daughter, Gisela (born 1968). Nicolas died in 1989 at the age of 23 after accidentally falling from the balcony of his Johannesburg apartment.

Coetzee&#x27;s younger brother, the journalist David Coetzee, died in 2010.

His partner, Dorothy Driver, is an academic at the University of Adelaide.

<text>The boondocks is an American expression from the Tagalog (Filipino) word &quot;bundók&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;). It originally referred to a remote rural area, but now, is often applied to an out-of-the-way area considered backward and unsophisticated by city-folk. It can also occasionally refer to a mountain in both Filipino and American context.

==Origins==
The expression was introduced to American English by U.S. military personnel fighting in the Philippine–American War (1899–1902). It derives from the Tagalog word &quot;bundók&quot;, which means &quot;mountain&quot;. According to military historian Paul A. Kramer, the term originally had &quot;connotations of bewilderment and confusion&quot;, due to the guerrilla warfare in which the soldiers were engaged.

In the Philippines, the word &quot;bundók&quot; is also a colloquialism referring to rural inland areas, which are usually mountainous and difficult to access, as most major cities and settlements in the Philippines are located in lowlands or near the coastline. Equivalent terms include the Spanish-derived &quot;probinsiya&quot; (&quot;province&quot;) and the Cebuano term &quot;bukid&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;). When used generally, the term refers to a mountainous area with a connotation of being rustic or uncivilized. When referring to people ( or in Tagalog; in Cebuano; English: &quot;someone who comes from the mountains/provinces&quot;), it is sometimes used to connote a stereotype of naive or boorish countryside dwellers.

==Expanded meanings==
The term evolved into American slang to refer to &quot;the countryside&quot; or isolated rural/wilderness area, regardless of topography or vegetation. Similar slang or colloquial words are &quot;the sticks&quot;, &quot;the wops&quot;, &quot;the backblocks&quot;, or &quot;Woop Woop&quot; in Australia, &quot;the wop-wops&quot; in New Zealand, &quot;&quot; in South Africa (unrelated to &quot;boondocks&quot; or &quot;bundok&quot;), &quot;out in the weeds&quot; in New Brunswick and &quot;out in the tules&quot; in California. The diminutive &quot;boonies&quot; can be heard in films about the Vietnam War such as Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Casualties of War&quot; (1989) used by American soldiers to designate rural areas of Vietnam.

Boondocking refers to camping with a recreational vehicle (RV) in a remote location without the electricity, water, or sewer infrastructure that is available at campgrounds or RV parks.

<doc id="333264" wikidata="Q892984" url="?curid=333264" title="Book of Durrow">
<text>The Book of Durrow is an illuminated manuscript gospel book dated to that contains the Vulgate Latin text of the four Gospels, with some Irish variations, and other matter, written in Insular script, and richly illustrated in the style of Insular art with four full-page Evangelist symbols, six carpet pages, and many decorated initials.

Its origin and dating has been subject to much debate. The book was probably made in Ireland, in or near Durrow Abbey, County Offaly, founded by Colum Cille (or Columba) in the 6th century, rather than the sometimes proposed origin of Northumbria, a region that had close political and artistic ties with Ireland, and like Scotland, also venerated Colum Cille.

Historical records indicate that the book was probably at Durrow Abbey by 916, making it one of the earliest extant Insular manuscripts. The abbey did not survive the Norman invasion of Ireland. The book is badly damaged, and has been repaired and rebound many times over the centuries. Today it is in the Library of Trinity College Dublin (TCD MS 57).

==Description==
It is the oldest surviving complete illuminated Insular gospel book, for example predating the Book of Kells by over a century. The text includes the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, plus several pieces of prefatory matter (the Letter of Jerome, prefaces, summaries, glossary of proper names and canon tables). Its pages measure 245 by 145 mm and there are 248 vellum folios. It contains a large illumination programme including six extant carpet pages, a full page miniature of the four evangelists&#x27; symbols, four full page miniatures, each containing a single evangelist symbol, and six pages with significant decorated initials and text. It is written in majuscule insular script (in effect the block capitals of the day), with some lacunae.

The page size has been reduced by subsequent rebindings, and most leaves are now single when unbound, where many or most would originally have been in &quot;bifolia&quot; or folded pairs. It is clear that some pages have been inserted in the wrong places. The main significance of this is that it is unclear if there was originally a seventh carpet page. Now Matthew does not have one, but there is, most unusually, one as the last page in the book. Perhaps there were only ever six: one at the start of the book with a cross, one opposite the next page with the four symbols (as now), and one opposite each individual symbol at the start of each gospel. Otherwise the original programme of illumination seems to be complete, which is rare in manuscripts of this age.

In the standard account of the development of the Insular gospel book, the Book of Durrow follows the fragmentary Northumbrian Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.) and precedes the Book of Lindisfarne, which was begun around 700.

==Illumination==

The illumination of the book shows especially well the varied origins of the Insular style, and has been a focus for the intense art-historical discussion of the issue. One thing that is clear is that the artist was unused to representing the human figure; his main attempt, the Man symbol for Matthew, has been described as a &quot;walking buckle&quot;. Apart from Anglo-Saxon metalwork, and Coptic and Syriac manuscript illustrations, the figure has been compared to a bronze figure with a panel of geometric enamel on his trunk, from a bucket found in Norway. Christopher de Hamel writes that, &quot;Like the Book of Kells, [the Book of Durrow] carries the legend that it was copied by Saint Columba... It too has a set of Canon tables, six elaborate carpet pages, five full-page images of the symbols of the Evangelists (one on folio 2r showing all four, the others at the start of each Gospel), five very large initials up to full page in size, and very numerous smaller initials. The Book of Durrow is not as elaborate as the Book of Kells or as large, but it shows all those incipient features of swirling Celtic interlace and infill.&quot;

The animal iconography derives from Germanic zoomorphic designs; the depictions of the Jesus and the Evangelists from Pictish stones. The geometric borders and the carpet pages cause more disagreement. The interlace, like that of the Durham fragment, is mostly large compared to the Book of Lindisfarne, but the extreme level of detail found in later Insular books begins here in the Celtic spirals and other curvilinear decoration used in initials and in sections of carpet pages. The page illustrated at left has animal interlace around the sides that is drawn from Germanic Migration Period Animal Style II, as found for example in the Anglo-Saxon jewellery at Sutton Hoo, and on the Benty Grange hanging bowl. But the circular panel in the centre seems, although not as precisely as other parts of the book, to draw on Celtic sources, although the three white circles at the edge recall Germanic metalwork studs in enamel or other techniques.

The Book of Durrow is unusual in that it does not use the traditional scheme, usual since Saint Jerome, for assigning the symbols to the Evangelists. Each Gospel begins with an Evangelist&#x27;s symbol – a man for Matthew, an eagle for Mark (not the lion traditionally used), a calf for Luke and a lion for John (not the eagle traditionally used). This is also known as the pre-Vulgate arrangement. Each evangelist symbol, except the Man of Matthew is followed by a carpet page, followed by the initial page. This missing carpet page is assumed to have existed. A first possibility is that it was lost, and a second that it is in fact folio 3, which features swirling abstract decoration. Where the four symbols appear together on folio 2r they appear in the normal order if read clockwise, and in the pre-Vulgate order if read anti-clockwise, which may be deliberate.

The first letter of the text is enlarged and decorated, with the following letters surrounded by dots. Parallels with metalwork can be noted in the rectangular body of St Matthew, which looks like a millefiori decoration, and in details of the carpet pages.

There is a sense of space in the design of all the pages of the Book of Durrow. Open vellum balances intensely decorated areas. Animal interlace of very high quality appears on folio 192v. Other motifs include spirals, triskeles, ribbon plaits and circular knots in the carpet pages and borders around the Four Evangelists.

==Evangelists&#x27; symbols==
==History==

The book is named after a monastery in Durrow, County Offaly, founded by Colum Cille late in his life, while he was abbot of Iona. Although Colum Cille founded monasteries in Ireland, Scotland and the early medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom Northumbria in today&#x27;s Northern England, the rough recent consensus amongst scholars is that the book was produced at Durrow, or at least in Ireland, around 700, although the range of proposed dates around that year is fairly large, and largely dependent on the dating given to other related manuscripts.

The colophon of the book (f. 247r) contains an erased and overwritten note which, according to one interpretation, is by &quot;Colum&quot; who scribed the book, which he said he did in twelve days. This probably relates to the belief that Colum Cille (Saint Columba) had created the book, but its date and authenticity is unclear. Twelve days is a plausible time to scribe one gospel, but not four, still less with all the decoration. 

What is known for certain is that Flann Sinna (877-916), High King of Ireland, commissioned a silver cumdach, a &quot;book-shrine&quot; or metalwork reliquary for the book. The shrine is the earliest known cumdach, and was recorded by the antiquary Roderick O&#x27;Flaherty in 1677, after the MS reached Trinity College, but then disappeared in the disturbances of 1689, when Trinity College was taken over by the military. By 1699 it had only &quot;a plain brown rough leathern cover&quot;. In the description of 1677, which is now bound into the manuscript as Folio IIv, the cover had a silver cross, an arm of which was inscribed in Irish with the name of the craftsman (not recorded by O&#x27;Flaherty) and on the main shaft an inscription &quot;invoking the blessing of St Colum Cille on King Flann, who caused the shrine to be made&quot;. Typically, cumdachs were not easily openable, and once in the shrine it was probably rarely if ever removed for use as a book. 

The manuscript was still at Durrow Abbey at some point around 1100, as a note on folio 248v by the Durrow scribe Flannchad Ua hEolais, records the transfer to Durrow Abbey of land by another monastery. The monastery seems physically to have been destroyed after the Norman Invasion of Ireland, its lands passing to Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, who used the stones in his new castle at the site. But the monastery may have maintained some sort of existence until the Protestant Reformation, when all monasteries were dissolved in 1547.

Like other books thought to have been owned or scribed by saints, it was regarded as a relic, in this case of Colum Cille. It was recorded that by 1627 the un-named custodian of the book (&quot;the Ignorant man that had same in his Custody&quot;) used it to cure disease in cattle by immersion in water, which was then given to the cows. The present folios 208 to 221 show particular damage from immersion, and have a hole in the top right corner. Probably this section was detached from the rest, tied with a string through the hole, and used for this purpose.
At the latest by 1547, when Durrow Abbey was dissolved, the book went into private ownership; whose is unknown. It was borrowed and studied by James Ussher, probably when he was Bishop of Meath from 1621 to 1623. In the period 1661 to 1682 it was given to the library at Trinity College, together with the Book of Kells, by Henry Jones while he was Bishop of Meath.

<text>The Sapphic stanza, named after the Ancient Greek poet Sappho, is an Aeolic verse form of four lines. Originally composed in quantitative verse and unrhymed, since the Middle Ages imitations of the form typically feature rhyme and accentual prosody. It is &quot;the longest lived of the Classical lyric strophes in the West&quot;.

==Definitions==

In poetry, &quot;Sapphic&quot; may refer to three distinct but related Aeolic verse forms:

# The &quot;greater Sapphic&quot;, a 15-syllable line, with the structure: – u – – – | u u – | – u u – u – – –=long syllable; u=short syllable; |=caesura
# The &quot;lesser Sapphic&quot;, an 11-syllable line, with the structure: – u – x – u u – u – – x=anceps (either long or short)
# The &quot;Sapphic stanza&quot;, typically conceptualized as comprising 3 &quot;lesser Sapphic&quot; lines followed by an adonic, with the structure: – u u – –

Classical Latin poets duplicated the Sapphic stanza with subtle modification.

Since the Middle Ages the terms &quot;Sapphic stanzas&quot; or frequently simply &quot;Sapphics&quot; have come to denote various stanzaic forms approaching more or less closely to Classical Sapphics, but often featuring accentual meter or rhyme (neither occurring in the original form), and with line structures mirroring the original with varying levels of fidelity.

==Aeolic Greek==

Alcaeus of Mytilene composed in, and may have invented, the Sapphic stanza, but it is his contemporary and compatriot Sappho whose example exerted the greatest influence, and for whom the verseform is now named. Both lived around 600 BCE on the island of Lesbos and wrote in the Aeolic dialect of Greek.

The original Aeolic verse takes the form of a 3-line stanza:
However, these stanzas are frequently analyzed as 4 lines, thus:
While Sappho used several metrical forms for her poetry, she is most famous for the Sapphic stanza. Her poems in this meter (collected in Book I of the ancient edition) ran to 330 stanzas, a significant part of her complete works, and of her surviving poetry: fragments 1-42.

Sappho&#x27;s most famous poem in this metre is Sappho 31, which begins as follows:
(In this stanza, all anceps positions are filled with long syllables.) Transliteration and formal equivalent paraphrase (substituting English stress for Greek length):

==Latin==
===Classical===

A few centuries later, the Roman poet Catullus admired Sappho&#x27;s work and used the Sapphic stanza in two poems: Catullus 11 (commemorating the end of his affair with Clodia) and Catullus 51 (marking its beginning). The latter is a free translation of Sappho 31.

Horace wrote 25 of his &quot;Odes&quot; as well as the in Sapphics. Two tendencies of Catullus became normative practice with Horace: the occurrence of a caesura after the fifth syllable; and the fourth syllable (formerly anceps) becoming habitually long. Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; became the chief models for subsequent Sapphics, whether in Latin or the later vernaculars — hence the term &quot;Horatian Sapphic&quot; for this modified model. But due to linguistic change, Horace&#x27;s imitators split on whether they imitated his quantitative structure (the long and short syllables, Horace&#x27;s metrical foundation), or his accentual patterns (the stressed or unstressed syllables which were somewhat ordered, but not determinative of Horace&#x27;s actual formal structure). Gasparov provides this double scansion of &quot;Ode&quot; 1.22 (lines 1-4), which also displays Horace&#x27;s typical long fourth syllables and caesura after the fifth:
 – u – – – u u – u – ∩
 
 – u – – – u u – u – –
 
 – u – – – u u – u – –
 
 – u u – –
 
 /=stressed syllable; ×=unstressed syllable; ∩=&quot;brevis in longo&quot;

This can be translated as:
:&#x27;A man of integrity, untainted by sin,
:has no need of Mauritanian javelins or bow,
:nor, Fuscus, of a quiver pregnant
:with poisoned arrows&#x27;

Other ancient poets who used the Sapphic stanza are Statius (in &quot;Silvae&quot; 4.7), Prudentius, Ausonius, Paulinus of Nola and Venantius Fortunatus (once in &quot;Carmina&quot; 10.7).

Usually, the lesser Sapphic line is found only within the Sapphic stanza; however, both Seneca the Younger (in his &quot;Hercules Oetaeus&quot;) and Boethius used the line in extended passages (thus resembling the stichic quality of blank verse more than a stanzaic lyric).

===Greater Sapphic===
In one poem (Odes 1.8) Horace uses stanzas of the following form, consisting of an aristophaneus and a greater Sapphic line:

:   – ᴗ ᴗ – ᴗ – x
:– ᴗ – – – ᴗ ᴗ – | – ᴗ ᴗ – ᴗ – x
:
:

:   &#x27;Lydia, tell me this, by all
:the gods truly, why do you hasten
:   to destroy Sybaris by loving him, why does he shun
:the sunny Campus, though he can tolerate the dust and the sun...&#x27;

Nisbet and Hubbard cite no other examples of this metrical form in Horace or in other poets. The metre is not found in the fragments of Sappho and Alcaeus.

===Medieval===

The Sapphic stanza was one of the few classical quantitative meters to survive into the Middle Ages, when accentual rather than quantitative prosody became the norm. Many Latin hymns were written in Sapphic stanzas, including the famous hymn for John the Baptist which gave the original names of the sol-fa scale:

Accentual Sapphic stanzas that ignore Classical Latin vowel quantities are also attested, as in the 11th-century &quot;Carmen Campidoctoris&quot;, which stresses the 1st, 4th and 10th syllables of the lines while keeping the Horatian caesura after the fifth (here with a formal equivalent paraphrase):

==English==

Though some English poets attempted quantitative effects in their verse, quantity is not phonemic in English. So, imitations of the Sapphic stanza are typically structured by replacing &quot;long&quot; with &quot;stressed&quot; syllables, and &quot;short&quot; with &quot;unstressed&quot; syllables (and often additional alterations, as exemplified below).

The Sapphic stanza was imitated in English, using a line articulated into three sections (stressed on syllables 1, 5, and 10) as the Greek and Latin would have been, by Algernon Charles Swinburne in a poem he simply called &quot;Sapphics&quot;:
Thomas Hardy chose to open his first verse collection &quot;Wessex Poems and Other Verses&quot; (1898) with &quot;The Temporary the All&quot;, a poem in Sapphics, perhaps as a declaration of his skill and as an encapsulation of his personal experience.
Rudyard Kipling wrote a tribute to William Shakespeare in Sapphics called &quot;The Craftsman&quot;. He hears the line articulated into four, with stresses on syllables 1, 4, 6, and 10 (despite being called a &quot;schoolboy error&quot; by classical scholar L. P. Wilkinson due to Horace&#x27;s regularisation of the 4th syllable as a long, stressing the 4th-syllable was a common approach in several Romance languages). His poem begins:
Allen Ginsberg also experimented with the form:
The Oxford classicist Armand D&#x27;Angour has created mnemonics to illustrate the difference between Sapphics heard as a &quot;four-beat line&quot; (as in Kipling) versus the &quot;three-beat measure&quot;, as follows:
Notable contemporary Sapphic poems include &quot;Sapphics for Patience&quot; by Annie Finch, &quot;Dusk: July&quot; by Marilyn Hacker, &quot;Buzzing Affy&quot; (a translation of &quot;An Ode to Aphrodite&quot;) by Adam Lowe, and &quot;Sapphics Against Anger&quot; by Timothy Steele.

==Other languages==
Written in Latin, the Sapphic stanza was already one of the most popular verseforms of the Middle Ages, but Renaissance poets began composing Sapphics in several vernacular languages, preferring Horace as their model above their immediate Medieval Latin predecessors.

Leonardo Dati composed the first Italian Sapphics in 1441, followed by Galeotto del Carretto, Claudio Tolomei, and others.

The Sapphic stanza has been very popular in Polish literature since the 16th century. It was used by many poets. Sebastian Klonowic wrote a long poem, , using the form. The formula of 11/11/11/5 syllables was so attractive that it can be found in other forms, among others the Słowacki stanza: 11a/11b/11a/5b/11c/11c.

In 1653, Paul Gerhardt used the Sapphic strophe format in the text of his sacred morning song &quot;Lobet den Herren alle, die ihn ehren&quot;. Sapphic stanza was often used in poetry of German Humanism and Baroque. It is also used in hymns such as &quot;Herzliebster Jesu&quot; by Johann Heermann. In the 18th century, amidst a resurgence of interest in Classical versification, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock wrote unrhymed Sapphics, regularly moving the position of the dactyl.

Esteban Manuel de Villegas wrote Sapphics in Spanish in the 17th century.

Miquel Costa i Llobera wrote Catalan Sapphics in the late 19th century, in his book of poems in the manner of Horace, called &quot;Horacianes&quot;.

<doc id="333269" wikidata="Q847327" url="?curid=333269" title="First Bible of Charles the Bald">
<text>The First Bible of Charles the Bald (BNF Lat. 1), also known as the Vivian Bible, is a Carolingian-era Bible commissioned by Count Vivian of Tours in 845, the lay abbot of Saint-Martin de Tours, and presented to Charles the Bald in 846 on a visit to the church, as shown in the presentation miniature at the end of the book. It is 495 mm by 345 mm and has 423 vellum folia. It is now in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.

It is also thought to be the third illuminated Bible to have been made at Tours following the Bamberg Bible (Staatsbibliothek Bamberg Msc. Bibl. 1) and Moutier-Grandval Bible (British Library Add MS 10546).

The Vivian Bible contains many illuminations, including the Psalms frontispiece, depicting David Composing Psalms, and the presentation miniature, in which Charles the Bald receives the book. The psalms frontispiece is said to have connections with the prophet Audradas because of the writing above David&#x27;s head. This connection can also be seen with the four virtues which are in the corners of the painting. These virtues are depicted as women on clouds with their arms outstretched. We can see David&#x27;s guards, who also have a symbolic meaning. They are meant to represent two Old Testament families that guarded David. Along with the guards we see David at the center who is playing the lyre, and his four musicians. All these figures are held within a large mandorla, illustrating the heavenly realm. David appears naked with just a bit of drapery covering his upper half. This is representative of David&#x27;s modesty and humility.

The presentation miniature is an illumination of Charles the Bald receiving the Vivian Bible when he was just 22 years old. The illumination includes both the Pope and Charles the Bald, showing how the Pope and rulers were becoming reliant on each other during the Carolingian period. This illumination replaced the apocalypse miniature as the tailpiece of the Vivian Bible. The illumination has the figures arranged in a circle. This makes it look like a procession is occurring in the image. Additionally, Charles seems like a mediator between God and man, evident with the hand of God and the curtains that frame the enthroned Charles at the center. There is some uncertainty as to who exactly each person in this image is. The men to Charles&#x27; left and right are not described in the text of the bible, but it is thought that they might be palace officials. In the center right it is thought that the figure is Vivian. It was originally thought the man with his back turned to the viewer was Vivian, but this is the Pater (the father). There are also guards in this image which are like the guards in David composing the psalms. These guards are representative of Charles&#x27; military force.

<doc id="333271" wikidata="Q561341" url="?curid=333271" title="Codex Aureus of Saint Emmeram">
<text>The Codex Aureus of Saint Emmeram (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 14000) is a 9th-century illuminated Gospel Book. It takes its name from Saint Emmeram&#x27;s Abbey, where it was for most of its history (named after Emmeram of Regensburg) and is lavishly illuminated. The cover of the codex is decorated with gems and relief figures in gold, and can be precisely dated to 870, and is an important example of Carolingian art, as well as one of very few surviving treasure bindings of this date. 

The upper cover of the Lindau Gospels is probably a product of the same workshop, though there are differences of style. This workshop is associated with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles II (the Bald), and often called his &quot;Palace School&quot;. Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but Saint-Denis Abbey outside Paris is one leading possibility. The Arnulf Ciborium (a miniature architectural ciborium rather than the vessel for hosts), now in the Munich Residenz, is the third major work in the group, along with the frame of an antique serpentine dish in the Louvre. Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf Ciborium in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either.

==History==
It was produced for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles II (the Bald) in 870 at his Carolingian Palace School. It is not known for certain where the Palace School was then based (after its previous base at St Martin&#x27;s Abbey in Tours was destroyed in 853), but it had probably moved to the Basilica of St Denis outside Paris by the time of the Codex Aureus&#x27;s production. Charles gave it to Arnulf of Carinthia. 11th century sources state it was produced in 893 and given to emperor Arnulf of Carinthia, who in turn donated it to Saint Emmeram&#x27;s Abbey, then under abbot Tuto. On secularisation in 1811 it was given to the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich (catalogue reference Clm 14000).

==Content==
It was written out by the monks Liuthard and Beringer. Seven full-page miniatures show the four evangelists, Charles the Bald enthroned, the Adoration of the Lamb and a Christ in Majesty. It also includes twelve canon tables, ten illuminated initials and incipits. The text is written in golden uncial letters, with each page framed. It measures 420 mm by 330 mm and has 126 vellum folios.

The cover is handmade of gold, and decorated with precious gemstones, sapphires, emeralds, and pearls. At the centre of the cover appears Christ in Majesty, in repoussé relief, seated on the globe of the world and holding on his knee a book inscribed with the words: &quot;I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.&quot; The inclusion of this inscription again identifies the Gospel Book with Christ. The verse makes equal sense if we read the speaker as Christ or as the Gospel Book. Surrounding Christ outside a frame are four seated evangelist portraits, above or below each of which is a scene from their Gospel. Reading from top left, clockwise, these are: Christ and the Adulterous Woman, the Expulsion of the Money-lenders from the Temple, Healing of the Blind Man, Healing of the Leper.

During the Carolingian era, King Charlemagne believed in the spiritual powers of gemstones and minerals, and their magical connection to heaven. He believed sapphires symbolized an image of heaven, heavenly virtues, and eternal life. Charlemagne passed down his interest in the spiritual qualities of gemstones to his grandson, Charles the Bald, who ordered the Codex Aureus and Lindau Gospels to be written in 870. The artisans created the covers with emeralds, sapphires, rubies, garnets, agate, and pearls. The standard of the work is extremely refined, with each of the gems in a setting that rises up from the plane of the cover and is decorated with fine detail. The &quot;claws&quot; holding the gems in place are minutely formed as acanthus leaves; earlier jewelled metalwork usually used plain &quot;claw&quot;-type settings.

According to the Book of Exodus in the Bible, God was in heaven standing on a street paved with sapphires, “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.” (Exodus 24: 9-10) The elaborate and costly decoration of the cover is meant to glorify the Word of God.

<doc id="333274" wikidata="Q1571955" url="?curid=333274" title="Concert pitch">
<text>Concert pitch is the pitch reference to which a group of musical instruments are tuned for a performance. Concert pitch may vary from ensemble to ensemble, and has varied widely over time. The ISO defines international standard pitch as A440, setting 440 Hz as the frequency of the A above middle C. Frequencies of other notes are defined relative to this pitch.

The written pitches for transposing instruments do not match those of non-transposing instruments. For example, a written C on a B clarinet or trumpet sounds as a non-transposing instrument&#x27;s B. The term &quot;concert pitch&quot; is used to refer to the pitch on a non-transposing instrument, to distinguish it from the transposing instrument&#x27;s written note. The clarinet or trumpet&#x27;s written C is thus referred to as &quot;concert B&quot;.

==Modern standard concert pitch==
The A above middle C is often set at the international standard of 440 Hz. Historically, this A has been tuned to a variety of different pitches.

==History of pitch standards in Western music==
Historically, various standards have been used to fix the pitch of notes at certain frequencies. Various systems of musical tuning have also been used to determine the relative frequency of notes in a scale.

===Pre-19th century===
Until the 19th century there was no coordinated effort to standardize musical pitch, and the levels across Europe varied widely. Pitches varied over time, from place to place, and even within the same city. The pitch used for an English cathedral organ in the 17th century, for example, could be as much as five semitones lower than that used for a domestic keyboard instrument in the same city.

Because of the way organs were tuned, the pitch of a single organ could even vary over time. Generally, the end of an organ pipe would be tapped with a cone tuning tool to curve it inwards to raise the pitch, or outwards to lower it.

The tuning fork was invented in 1711, enabling the calibration of pitch, although there was still variation. For example, a 1740 tuning fork associated with Handel is pitched at A =  while a specimen from 1780 is pitched at A =  about a quarter-tone lower. A tuning fork that belonged to Ludwig van Beethoven around 1800, now in the British Library, is pitched at A = , well over a half-tone higher.

Towards the end of the 18th century there was an overall tendency for the A above middle C to be in the range of to 

The frequencies referred to here are based on modern measurements and would not have been precisely known to musicians of the day. Although Mersenne had made a rough determination of sound frequencies as early as the 17th century, such measurements did not become scientifically accurate until the 19th century, beginning with the work of German physicist Johann Scheibler in the 1830s. Frequency is measured in cycles per second (CPS). During the 20th century this term was gradually replaced by &quot;hertz&quot; (Hz) in honor of Heinrich Hertz.

===Pitch inflation===
When instrumental music has risen in prominence (relative to vocal music), there has been a consistent tendency for pitch standards to rise. This led to reform efforts on at least two occasions. At the beginning of the 17th century, Michael Praetorius reported in his encyclopedic &quot;Syntagma musicum&quot; that pitch levels had become so high that singers were experiencing severe throat strain and lutenists and viol players were complaining of snapped strings. The standard voice ranges he cites show that the pitch level of his time, at least in the part of Germany where he lived, was at least a minor third higher than today&#x27;s. Solutions to this problem were sporadic and local, but generally involved the establishment of separate standards for voice and organ () and for chamber ensembles (). Where the two were combined, as for example in a cantata, the singers and instrumentalists might use music written in different keys. This kept pitch inflation at bay for some two centuries.

Concert pitch rose further in the 19th century, evidenced by tuning forks of that era in France. The pipe organ tuning fork in Versailles Chapel from 1795 is 390 Hz, an 1810 Paris Opera tuning fork sounds at A = 423 Hz, an 1822 fork gives A = 432 Hz, and an 1855 fork gives A = 449 Hz. At La Scala in Milan the A above middle C rose as high as .

===19th- and 20th-century standards===


Rising pitch put a strain on singers&#x27; voices and, largely due to their protests, the French government passed a law on February 16, 1859 setting the A above middle C at 435 Hz, . This was the first attempt to standardize pitch on such a scale, and was known as the &quot;diapason normal&quot;. It became a popular pitch standard outside France as well, and has been known at various times as &quot;French pitch&quot;, &quot;continental pitch&quot; or &quot;international pitch&quot; (this international pitch is not the 1939 &quot;international standard pitch&quot; described below). An 1885 conference in Vienna established this standard in Italy, Austria, Hungary, Russia, Prussia, Saxony, Sweden and Württemberg. This was included as &quot;Convention of 16 and 19 November 1885 regarding the establishment of a concert pitch&quot; in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 which formally ended World War I. The &quot;diapason normal&quot; resulted in middle C being tuned at about .

An alternative pitch standard known as &quot;philosophical&quot; or &quot;scientific pitch&quot; fixes middle C at (that is, 28 Hz), which places the A above it at approximately in equal temperament tuning. The appeal of this system is its mathematical idealism (the frequencies of all the Cs being powers of two). This never received the same official recognition as the French A = 435 Hz and has not been widely used. This tuning has been promoted unsuccessfully by the LaRouche movement&#x27;s Schiller Institute under the name &quot;Verdi tuning&quot; since Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi had proposed a slight lowering of the French tuning system. However, the Schiller Institute&#x27;s recommended tuning for A of 432 Hz uses the Pythagorean ratio of 27:16, rather than the logarithmic ratio of equal temperament tuning.

British attempts at standardization in the 19th century gave rise to the &quot;old philharmonic pitch&quot; standard of about A = 452 Hz (different sources quote slightly different values), replaced in 1896 by the considerably lower &quot;new philharmonic pitch&quot; of A = 439 Hz. The high pitch was maintained by Sir Michael Costa for the Crystal Palace Handel Festivals, causing the withdrawal of the principal tenor Sims Reeves in 1877, though at singers&#x27; insistence the Birmingham Festival pitch was lowered and the organ retuned at that time. At the Queen&#x27;s Hall in London, the establishment of the &quot;diapason normal&quot; for the Promenade Concerts in 1895 (and retuning of the organ to A = 435.5 at , to be in tune with A = 439 in a heated hall) caused the Royal Philharmonic Society and others (including the Bach Choir, and the Felix Mottl and Arthur Nikisch concerts) to adopt the continental pitch.

In England the term &quot;low pitch&quot; was used from 1896 onward to refer to the new Philharmonic Society tuning standard of A = 439 Hz at , while &quot;high pitch&quot; was used for the older tuning of A = 452.4 Hz at . Although the larger London orchestras were quick to conform to the new low pitch, provincial orchestras continued using the high pitch until at least the 1920s, and most brass bands were still using the high pitch in the mid-1960s. Highland pipe bands continue to use an even sharper tuning, around A = 470–480 Hz, over a semitone higher than A440. As a result, bagpipes are often perceived as playing in B despite being notated in A (as if they were transposing instruments in D-flat), and are often tuned to match B brass instruments when the two are required to play together.

In 1834 the Stuttgart Conference of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians recommended C264 (A440) as the standard pitch based on Scheibler&#x27;s studies with his Tonometer. For this reason A440 has been referred to as Stuttgart pitch or Scheibler pitch.

In 1939 an international conference recommended that the A above middle C be tuned to 440 Hz, now known as &quot;concert pitch&quot;. This was adopted as a technical standard by the International Organization for Standardization in 1955 and reaffirmed by them in 1975 as ISO 16. The difference between this and the &quot;diapason normal&quot; is due to confusion over the temperature at which the French standard should be measured. The initial standard was A = , but this was superseded by A = 440 Hz, possibly because 439 Hz was difficult to reproduce in a laboratory since 439 is a prime number.

In 1964, of 31 top professional U.S. orchestras, 19 were tuning at 440, the others at 441 or 442. In 1987, the New York Times surveyed international practice, noting that “the A of most symphony and opera orchestras today ranges between 440 and 444.”

==Current concert pitches==
The most common standard around the world is currently A = 440 Hz.

In practice most orchestras tune to a note given out by the oboe, and most oboists use an electronic tuning device when playing the tuning note. Some orchestras tune using an electronic tone generator. When playing with fixed-pitch instruments such as the piano, the orchestra will generally tune to them—a piano will normally have been tuned to the orchestra&#x27;s normal pitch. Overall, it is thought that the general trend since the middle of the 20th century has been for standard pitch to rise, though it has been rising far more slowly than it has in the past. Some orchestras like the Berlin Philharmonic now use a slightly lower pitch (443 Hz) than their highest previous standard (445 Hz).

Many modern ensembles who specialize in the performance of Baroque music have agreed on a standard of A = 415 Hz. An exact equal-tempered semitone lower than 440 Hz would be 415.305 Hz, though this is rounded to the nearest integer for simplicity and convenience. In principle this allows for playing along with modern fixed-pitch instruments if their parts are transposed down a semitone. It is, however, common performance practice, especially in the German Baroque idiom, to tune certain works to , approximately a semitone higher than 440 Hz (460–470 Hz) (e.g., Pre-Leipzig period cantatas of Bach).

Orchestras in Cuba typically use A436 as the pitch so that strings, which are difficult to obtain, last longer. In 2015 American pianist Simone Dinnerstein brought attention to this issue and later traveled to Cuba with strings donated by friends.

=== Controversial claims for 432 Hz ===
Particularly in the beginning of the 21st century, many websites and online videos have been published arguing for the adoption of the 432 Hz tuning – often referred to as &quot;Verdi pitch&quot; – instead of the predominant 440 Hz. These claims also include conspiracy theories, related to specious claims of healing properties from 432 Hz pitch, or involving Nazis having favored the 440 Hz tuning.

<doc id="333281" wikidata="Q672573" url="?curid=333281" title="West–Eastern Divan Orchestra">
<text>The West–Eastern Divan Orchestra is based in Seville, Spain, and consists of musicians from countries across the Spanish world and the Middle East—of Egyptian, Iranian, Israeli, Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, and Hispanic background.

It was jointly founded in 1999 by Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim and Palestinian-American academic Edward Said, who named the Orchestra and workshop after &quot;West-östlicher Divan&quot;, an anthology of poems written by the German polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe - a central work for the development of the concept of world culture.

In 2015, Argentine pianist Martha Argerich, as Barenboim&#x27;s long term performing musical partner, was designated as an honorary member of the Divan Orchestra.

In 2016, the Barenboim–Said Akademie was established in Berlin, Germany, as a state-accredited music conservatory offering Bachelors of Music and Artist Diplomas. The Akademie, for which Barenboim serves as president, is based on the founding aims of the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra.

==History==

=== Establishment ===
In 1999, Barenboim and Said, who had become friends in the early 1990s, founded the West—Eastern Divan Orchestra in order to foment a feeling of sympathy and co-existence, chiefly between Arabs and Israelis, through Middle Eastern musical ensembles. Shortly after it was founded, the first workshop was opened in Weimar, Germany, after the organization had received over 200 applications from Arab music students. Barenboim has also expressed interest in musicians from Iran, allocating three chairs for Iranian musicians to play in the orchestra each year; though Iran is not an Arab country and therefore has not been a belligerent in the Arab–Israeli conflict, that particular environment exists in light of the Iran–Israel proxy conflict, which began a few years after Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolution in 1979.

In 2016, Ban Ki-moon, the erstwhile United Nations Secretary-General, designated the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra as a United Nations Global Advocate for Cultural Understanding, praising the organization&#x27;s push for peace and unity, particularly between Israelis and Palestinians.

===Performances===
Since 2011, the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra has participated in an annual concert at the Waldbühne in Berlin, Germany.

On 11 July 2012, in the presence of Italian president Giorgio Napolitano and his wife Clio Maria Bittoni, Barenboim led the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra&#x27;s performance for Pope Benedict XVI in the courtyard of the Apostolic Palace of Castel Gandolfo. The event commemorated the Christian feast day of the 6th-century Italian monk Benedict of Nursia (the abbot who founded the Benedictines), and thus the Pope&#x27;s name day.

A few days after the performance for Benedict XVI, Barenboim conducted the Orchestra&#x27;s performance of the complete symphonic cycle of Ludwig van Beethoven at the BBC Proms in London, England, marking the first time that all nine symphonies were performed under a single conductor in a single Prom season since English conductor Henry Wood did so in 1942.

In September–November 2012, the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra participated in the 9th Gwangju Biennale (ROUNDTABLE), held in Gwangju, South Korea.

In May 2022, the orchestra opened the prestigious Prague Spring Festival with two concerts of Bedřich Smetana&#x27;s tone poem Má vlast (My Country). The originally scheduled conductor, Mo Daniel Barenboim, was replaced by conductor Thomas Guggeis due to illness.

==Purpose==
The West–Eastern Divan Orchestra was founded to effectively promote understanding between Israelis and Palestinians and pave the way for a peaceful and fair resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Barenboim himself has spoken of the ensemble as follows:

&quot;The Divan is not a love story, and it is not a peace story. It has very flatteringly been described as a project for peace. It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not going to bring peace, whether you play well or not so well. The Divan was conceived as a project against ignorance. A project against the fact that it is absolutely essential for people to get to know the other, to understand what the other thinks and feels, without necessarily agreeing with it. I&#x27;m not trying to convert the Arab members of the Divan to the Israeli point of view, and [I&#x27;m] not trying to convince the Israelis to the Arab point of view. But I want to—and unfortunately I am alone in this now that Edward died a few years ago—create a platform where the two sides can disagree and not resort to knives.&quot;

One of the organization&#x27;s young Israeli musicians reinforced this point:

&quot;Barenboim is always saying his project is not political. But one of the really great things is that this is a political statement by both sides. It is more important not for people like myself, but for people to see that it is possible to sit down with Arab people and play. The orchestra is a human laboratory that can express to the whole world how to cope with the other.&quot;
==Andalucía==
The orchestra has performed around the world. It has an annual summer school in Seville. Since 2002, the Junta de Andalucía (Regional Government of Andalusia) and a private foundation have provided a base for the ensemble in Seville, Spain. Young musicians from Spain now also take part in the orchestra.

The West–Eastern Divan Workshop takes place during several weeks each summer in Andalucía. Once the working period is over, the concert tour of the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra starts. The orchestra has been awarded several prizes since its creation, among them the Príncipe de Asturias concord award in 2002 for Said and Barenboim, and the Premium Imperiale awarded by the Japan Arts Association.

In 2004, the Barenboim–Said Foundation, based in Seville and financed by the Junta de Andalucía was established with the purpose of developing several education through music projects based on the principles of coexistence and dialogue promoted by Said and Barenboim. In addition to managing the orchestra, the Barenboim–Said Foundation assists with other projects such as the Academy of Orchestral Studies, the Musical Education in Palestine project and the Early Childhood Musical Education Project in Seville.

==In popular culture==
A film by Paul Smaczny about the orchestra, &quot;Knowledge is the Beginning&quot;, won the Emmy Award for best documentary related to arts of 2006. In 2007, the orchestra received the Praemium Imperiale Grant for Young Artists. It has recorded for the Teldec label. The current concertmaster is , the son of Daniel Barenboim.

<text>Sosumi is an alert sound introduced by Apple sound designer Jim Reekes in Apple Inc.&#x27;s Macintosh System 7 operating system in 1991. The name is derived from the phrase &quot;so, sue me!&quot; because of a long running court battle with Apple Corps, the similarly named music company, regarding the use of music in Apple Inc.&#x27;s computer products.

==History==

Sosumi is a short xylophone sample, which gained notoriety in computer folklore as a defiant pun name, in response to a long-running &quot;Apple Corps v Apple Computer&quot; trademark conflict. The sound was long included in subsequent versions of its computer OS releases. However, in 2020 it was replaced in macOS Big Sur.

During the development of System 7, the two companies concluded a settlement agreement from an earlier dispute when Apple added a sound synthesis chip to its Apple IIGS machine. As a result, Apple Computer was prohibited from using its trademark on &quot;creative works whose principal content is music&quot;.

When new sounds for System 7 were created, the sounds were reviewed by Apple&#x27;s Legal Department who objected that the new sound alert &quot;chime&quot; had a name that was &quot;too musical&quot;, under a 1991 settlement. Jim Reekes, the creator of the new sound alerts for System 7, had grown frustrated with the legal scrutiny and first quipped it should be named &quot;Let It Beep&quot;, a pun on &quot;Let It Be&quot;. When someone remarked that that would not pass the Legal Department&#x27;s approval, he remarked, &quot;so sue me&quot;. After a brief reflection, he resubmitted the sound&#x27;s name as &quot;sosumi&quot; (a homophone of &quot;so sue me&quot;). Careful to submit it in written form rather than spoken form to avoid pronunciation, he told the Legal Department that the name was Japanese and had nothing to do with music.

In macOS Big Sur, the original chime was replaced with a different sample, named Sonumi. The original name was retained in the first public version of the OS, and was later changed to &quot;Sonumi&quot; as it appears in the System Preferences. The sound file itself in /System/Library/Sounds/ is still named Sosumi.aiff, and other alert sounds (such as &quot;Breeze&quot; or &quot;Crystal&quot;) still have the same file names from the previous macOS series (Blow.aiff and Glass.aiff).

==In popular culture==
The term is in the poem &quot;A Short Address to the Academy of Silence&quot; by Jay Parini.

Apple used the CSS class name &quot;sosumi&quot; for formatting legal fine print on Apple product web pages.

The 2002 Disney animated action-adventure film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, Jim Hawkins sees the skeleton of Captain Flint, holding B.E.N.&#x27;s missing memory chip in its hand, then he re-inserts the part into B.E.N.&#x27;s memory chip, making the Macintosh&#x27;s Sosumi sound effect, and the planet begins collapsing.

In 2006, Geek Squad used this sound in their commercial &quot;Jet Pack&quot;, in which a woman was frustrated over her computer.

<doc id="333285" wikidata="Q3586387" url="?curid=333285" title="2003 Ontario general election">
<text>The 2003 Ontario general election was held on October 2, 2003, to elect the 103 members of the 38th Legislative Assembly (Members of Provincial Parliament, or &quot;MPPs&quot;) of the province of Ontario, Canada.

The election was called on September 2 by Premier Ernie Eves in the wake of supporting polls for the governing Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in the days following the 2003 North American blackout. The election resulted in a majority government won by the Ontario Liberal Party, led by Dalton McGuinty.

==Leadup to the campaign==

In 1995, the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party under Mike Harris came from third place to upset the front-running Ontario Liberal Party under Lyn McLeod and the governing Ontario New Democratic Party under Bob Rae to form a majority government. Over the following two terms, the Harris government moved to cut personal income tax rates by 30%, closed almost 40 hospitals to increase efficiency, cut the Ministry of the Environment staff in half, and undertook massive reforms of the education system, including mandatory teacher testing, student testing in public education, and public tax credits for parents who sent their children to private schools.

In the 1999 provincial election, the Tories were able to ride a strong economy and a campaign aimed at depicting rookie Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty as &quot;not up to the job&quot; to another majority government. The Walkerton Tragedy, however, where a contaminated water supply led to the deaths of 7 people and illness of at least 2,300 were linked in part to government environment and regulatory cutbacks, and as a result the government&#x27;s popularity was badly damaged. A movement to provide tax credits to parents with children in private schools also proved to be unpopular.

In October 2001, Harris announced his intention to resign, and the PC party called a leadership convention for 2002 to replace him. Five candidates emerged: former Finance Minister Ernie Eves who had retired earlier that year, current Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer, Health Minister Tony Clement and Labour Minister Chris Stockwell. The resulting leadership election was divisive in the PC Party, with Flaherty adopting a hard-right platform and attacking the front-running Eves as &quot;a pale, pink imitation of Dalton McGuinty&quot; and a &quot;serial waffler&quot;. At one point, anti-abortion activists apparently supporting Flaherty distributed pamphlets attacking Tony Clement because his wife worked for hospitals that performed abortions. At the convention, Eves won on the second ballot after Elizabeth Witmer and Tony Clement both endorsed him.

Eves took office on April 15, 2002, and promptly re-aligned his government to the political centre. The party would negotiate a deal with striking government workers, dramatically cancel an IPO of Hydro One, the government&#x27;s electricity transmission company, and defer planned tax breaks for corporations and private schools for a year. With polls showing the Conservatives moving from a 15-point deficit to a tie in public opinion with the Liberals, the media praising Eves&#x27; political reorientation of the government, and the opposition Liberals reeling from the seizure of some of their political turf, the time seemed ripe for a snap election call. Many political observers felt that Eves had the momentum to win an election at that time.

However, several factors likely convinced Eves to wait to call an election. First, in 1990, the Liberals had lost the election in part due to perceptions that they called the election early for purely partisan reasons. Since then, the shortest distance between elections had been four years less five days (Ontario has since moved to fixed date election dates). Second, the PC Party was exhausted and divided from a six-month leadership contest. Third, the move to the centre had created opposition in traditional Conservative support. Financial conservatives and businesses were angered over Eves&#x27; cancellation of the hydro IPO. Others felt betrayed that promised tax cuts had not been delivered, seemingly breaking the PCs&#x27; own Taxpayer Protection Act, while private school supporters were upset their promised tax credit had been delayed for a year.

In the fall of 2002, the opposition Liberals began a round of attacks on perceived PC mismanagement. First, Jim Flaherty was embroiled in scandal when it was revealed that his leadership campaign&#x27;s largest donor had received a highly lucrative contract for slot machines from the government. Then, Tourism Minister Cam Jackson was forced to resign when the Liberals revealed he had charged taxpayers more than $100,000 for hotel rooms, steak dinners and alcoholic beverages. The Liberals showed the Tories had secretly given a large tax break to the Toronto Blue Jays, a team owned by prominent Tory Ted Rogers.

At the same time, both the New Democrats and Liberals criticized the government over skyrocketing electricity prices. In May 2002, the government had followed California and Alberta in deregulating the electricity market. With contracting supply due to construction delays at the Pickering nuclear power plant and rising demand for electricity in an unusually warm autumn, the spot price for electricity rose, resulting in consumer outrage. In November, Eves fixed the price of electricity and ended the open market, appeasing consumers but angering conservative free-marketers.

That winter, Eves promised a provincial budget before the beginning of the fiscal year, to help hospitals and schools budget effectively. However, as multiple scandals in the fall had already made the party unwilling to return to Question Period, they wished to dismiss the Legislative Assembly of Ontario until as late as possible in the spring. The budget was instead to be announced at the Magna International headquarters in Newmarket, Ontario, rather than in the Legislature. The move was met with outrage from the PC Speaker Gary Carr, who called the move unconstitutional and would rule that it was a &quot;prima facie&quot; case of contempt of the legislature. The controversy over the location of the budget far outstripped any support earned by the content of the budget.

The government faced a major crisis when SARS killed several people in Toronto and threatened the stability of the health care system. On April 23, when the World Health Organization advised against all but essential travel to Toronto to prevent the spread of the virus, Toronto tourism greatly suffered.

When the spring session was finally convened in late spring, the Eves government was forced through three days of debate on the contempt motion over the Magna budget followed by weeks of calls for the resignation of Energy Minister Chris Stockwell. Stockwell was accused of accepting thousands of dollars in undeclared gifts from Ontario Power Generation, an arms-length crown corporation he regulated, when he travelled to Europe in the summer of 2002. Stockwell finally stepped aside after dominating the provincial news for almost a month, and did not seek reelection.

By the summer of 2003, the Progressive Conservatives received an unexpected opportunity to re-gain popularity in the form of the 2003 North American blackout. When the blackout hit, Eves initially received criticism for his late response; however, as he led a series of daily briefings to the press in the days after the blackout, Eves was able to demonstrate leadership and stayed cool under pressure. The crisis also allowed Eves to highlight his principal campaign themes of experience, proven competence and ability to handle the government. When polls began to register a moderate increase for the Conservatives, the table was set for an election call.

==Progressive Conservative campaign==
In 1995 and 1999, the Progressive Conservatives ran highly focused, disciplined campaigns based on lessons learned principally in US states by the Republican Party. In 1995, the core PC strategy was to polarize the electorate around a handful of controversial ideas that would split opposition between the other two parties. The PCs stressed radical tax cuts, opposition to job quotas, slashing welfare rates and a few hot button issues such as opposing photo radar and establishing &quot;boot camps&quot; for young offenders. They positioned leader Mike Harris as an average-guy populist who would restore common sense to government after ten lost years of NDP and Liberal mismanagement. The campaign manifesto, released in 1994, was titled the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; and advocated a supply-side economics solution to a perceived economic malaise.

In 1999, the PCs were able to point to increased economic activity as evidence that their supply side plan worked. Their basic strategy was to polarize the electorate again around a handful of controversial ideas and their record while preventing opposition from rallying exclusively around the Liberals by undermining confidence in Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty. They ran a series of negative television ads against McGuinty in an attempt to brand him as &quot;not up to the job&quot;. At the same time, they emphasized their economic record, while downplaying disruptions in health care and education as part of a needed reorganization of public services that promoted efficiency and would lead to eventual improvements.

Both campaigns proved highly successful and the principal architects of those campaigns had been dubbed the &quot;whiz kids&quot; by the press. David Lindsay, Mike Harris&#x27;s chief of staff, was responsible for the overall integration of policy, communications, campaign planning and transition to government while Mitch Patten served as campaign secretary. Tom Long and Leslie Noble jointly ran the campaigns, with Long serving as campaign chair and Noble as campaign manager. Paul Rhodes, a former reporter, was responsible for media relations. Deb Hutton was Mike Harris&#x27;s right arm as executive assistant. Jaime Watt and Perry Miele worked on the advertising. Guy Giorno worked on policy and speechwriting in 1995 and in 1999 was in charge of overall messaging. Scott Munnoch was tour director and Glen Wright rode the leader&#x27;s bus. Future leader John Tory worked on fundraising and debate prep, and was actually one of two people (the other was John Matheson) to play Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty during preparation for the 1999 leaders&#x27; debate. (Andy Brandt and Giorno played NDP leader Howard Hampton.)

Heading into 2003, Tom Long refused to work for Ernie Eves. Most speculated that Long saw Eves as too wishy-washy and not enough of a traditional hard-right conservative. Jaime Watt took Long&#x27;s position as campaign co-chair and more or less all the same players settled into the same places. A few new faces included Jeff Bangs as campaign manager. Bangs was a long-time Eves loyalist who had grown up in his riding of Parry Sound.

The Progressive Conservatives once again planned on polarizing the electorate around a handful of hot button campaign pledges. However, with their party and government listing in public opinion polls, they found their only strong contrasts were around the experience and stature of Premier Eves. Their campaign slogan &quot;Experience You Can Trust&quot; was designed to highlight Eves&#x27; years in office.

The party platform, dubbed &quot;The Road Ahead&quot;, was longer and broader than in earlier years. Five main planks would emerge for the campaign:

# Tax deductions for mortgage payments.
# Rebate seniors the education portion of their property taxes.
# Tax credits for parents sending their children to private schools.
# Banning teachers&#x27; strikes by sending negotiations to binding arbitration.
# A &quot;Made-in-Ontario&quot; immigration system.

Each plank was targeted at a key Tory voting bloc: homeowners, seniors, religious conservatives, parents and law-and-order types.

Eves&#x27; campaigning followed a straightforward pattern. Eves would highlight one of the five elements of the platform and then attack Dalton McGuinty for opposing it. For instance, he would visit the middle-class home of a visible minority couple with two kids and talk about how much money they would get under his mortgage deductibility plan. That would be followed by an attack on McGuinty for having a secret plan to raise their taxes. Or he would campaign in a small town assembly plant and talk about how under a &quot;Made-in-Ontario&quot; immigration plan fewer new Canadians would settle in Toronto and more outside the city, helping the plant manager with his labour shortage. Then he would link McGuinty to Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien and say McGuinty supported the federal immigration system that allows terrorists and criminals into the country.

The Tory television advertising also attempted to polarize the election around these issues.

In one of the ads, a voice-over accompanying an unflattering photo of the Liberal leader asks &quot;Ever wonder why Dalton McGuinty wants to raise your taxes?&quot; The ad then points out that McGuinty has opposed Tory plans to allow homeowners a tax deduction on mortgage interest and to give senior citizens a break on their property taxes.

In another ad, the voice-over asks &quot;Doesn&#x27;t he (McGuinty) know that a child&#x27;s education is too important to be disrupted by lockouts and strikes?&quot; It says that McGuinty has sided with the unions and rejected the Tory proposal to ban teacher strikes.

Both ads end with the attack &quot;He&#x27;s still not up to the job.&quot;

Armed with a majority, the Tories were hoping to hold the seats they already had, while targeting a handful of rural Liberal seats in hopes of increasing their majority. They campaigned relatively little in Northern Ontario, with the exception of North Bay and Parry Sound, both of which they held.

==Liberal campaign==
The first half of Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s 1999 campaign was widely criticized as disorganized and uninspired, and most journalists believe he gave a poor performance in the leaders&#x27; debate. McGuinty, however, was able to rally his party in the last ten days. On election day, the Liberals won 40% of the vote, their second best showing in almost fifty years. Perhaps more importantly, nine new MPPs were elected, boosting the caucus from 30 to 35, including dynamic politicians like George Smitherman and Michael Bryant.

In 1999, the Liberal strategy had been to polarize the electorate between Mike Harris and Dalton McGuinty. They purposely put out a platform that was devoid of ideas, to ensure the election was about the Tory record, and not the Liberal agenda. To an extent, they succeeded. Support for the NDP collapsed from 21% to just 13%, while the Liberals climbed by 9%. While they almost cornered the market of those angry at the Tories, however, they could not convince enough people to be angry at the Tories to win.

The night he conceded defeat, McGuinty was already planning how to win the next election. He set out the themes that the Liberals would build into their next platform. Liberals, he said, would offer &quot;some of those things that Ontarians simply have to be able to count on - good schools, good hospitals, good health care, good education and something else... We want to bring an end to fighting so we can finally start working together.&quot;

McGuinty replaced many of his young staff with experienced political professionals he recruited. The three he kept in key positions were Don Guy, his campaign manager and a pollster with Pollara, Matt Maychak, his director of communications, and Bob Lopinski, his director of issues management. To develop his platform, he added to this a new chief of staff, Phil Dewan, a former policy director for Premier David Peterson and Ottawa veteran Gerald M. Butts. He also sought out Peterson-era Ontario Minister of Labour Greg Sorbara to run for president of the Ontario Liberal Party.

Early on, McGuinty set down three strategic imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against the conventional wisdom of politics that it was necessary to offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public health care and education services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking the opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.

The emphasis on building the team was highly successful as jobs that in 1999 were done by one person were now assigned to groups of four or six or eight. Dewan brought on board veterans of the Peterson regime such as Sheila James, Vince Borg and David MacNaughton. From Ottawa, campaign veterans such as Warren Kinsella, Derek Kent and Gordon Ashworth signed on to help oust the Ontario Tories from power.

The Liberal strategy was the same as in 1999: polarize the election between the Conservatives and Liberals to marginalize the NDP and then convince enough voters that the Conservatives had to go. With polls showing more than 60% of voters reporting it was &quot;time for a change&quot;, the Liberals campaign theme was &quot;choose change&quot;. The theme summarized the two-step strategy perfectly: first, boil the election down to a two-party choice and then cast the Liberals as a capable and trustworthy agent of change at a time when voters were fed up with the government.

After the sparse platform of 1999, the 2003 Liberal platform was a sprawling omnibus of public policy crossing five main policy booklets, three supplements aimed at specific geographic or industrial groups and a detailed costing exercise. The principle planks that were highlighted in the election were:

# Freezing taxes and balancing the books.
# Improving test scores and lowering class sizes in public schools.
# Reducing wait times for key health services.
# Improving environmental protection and quality of life.
# Repairing the divisions of the Harris-Eves era.

McGuinty backed up his comprehensive platform with a meticulous costing by a forensic accountant and two bank economists. While the Conservatives had adopted a third-party verification in 1995, they did not in 2003, allowing the Liberals to gain credibility that they could pay for their promises.

In contrast to the Eves campaign, where the leader was both positive and negative message carrier, the Liberals used a number of caucus members to criticize the Harris-Eves government while McGuinty was free to promote his positive plan for change.

The Liberal advertising strategy was highly risky. While conventional wisdom says the only way to successfully respond to a negative campaign is with even more negative ads against the opponent, McGuinty ran only positive ads for the duration of the campaign.

In the pre-writ period, the Liberal advertising featured Dalton McGuinty speaking to the camera, leaning against a tree while snow falls, saying &quot;People hear me say that I&#x27;ll fix our hospitals and fix our schools and yet keep taxes down. Am I an optimist? Maybe. What I&#x27;m not is cynical, or jaded, or tired. I don&#x27;t owe favours to special interests or old friends or political cronies. Together, we can make Ontario the envy of the world, once again. And, I promise you this, no one will work harder than I will to create that Ontario.&quot;

During the first stage of the campaign, the principal Liberal ad featured a tight close-up of Dalton McGuinty as he spoke about his plans for Ontario. In the key line of the first ad, McGuinty looks into the camera and says &quot;I won&#x27;t cut your taxes, but I&#x27;m not going to raise them either.&quot;

Geographically, the Liberal campaign was able to rest on a solid core of seats in Toronto and Northern Ontario that were at little risk at the beginning of the election period. They had to defend a handful of rural seats that had been recently won and were targeted by the PCs. The principle battlefield of the election, however, was in PC-held territory in the &quot;905&quot; region of suburbs around Toronto, particularly Peel and York districts, suburban seats around larger cities like Ottawa and Hamilton and in Southwestern Ontario in communities like London, Kitchener-Waterloo and Guelph.

==NDP campaign==
The 1999 NDP campaign received its lowest level of popular support since the Second World War, earning just 12.6% of the vote and losing party status with just nine seats. Several factors led to this poor showing, including a lacklustre campaign, Hampton&#x27;s low profile, and a movement called strategic voting that endorsed voting for the Liberals in most ridings in order to remove the governing Tories. After the election, there was a short-lived attempt to remove leader Howard Hampton publicly led by leaders of the party&#x27;s youth wing, however the majority of party members blamed the defeat on NDP supporters voting Liberal in hopes of removing Harris and the Tories from power. As a result, Hampton was not widely blamed for this severe defeat and stayed on as leader.

Under the rules of the Legislative Assembly, a party would receive &quot;official party status&quot;, and the resources and privileges accorded to officially recognized parties, if it had 12 or more seats; thus the NDP would lose caucus funding and the ability to ask questions in the House, however the governing Conservatives changed the rules after the election to lower the threshold for party status from 12 seats to 8. The Tories argued that since Ontario&#x27;s provincial ridings now had the same boundaries as the federal ones, the threshold should be lowered to accommodate the resultant smaller legislature. Others argued that the Tories were only helping the NDP so they could continue to split the vote with the Liberals.

During the period before the election, Hampton identified the Conservative plan for deregulating and privatizing electricity generation and transmission as the looming issue of the next election. With the Conservatives holding a firm market-oriented line and the Liberal position muddled, Hampton boldly focused the party&#x27;s Question Period and research agendas almost exclusively on energy issues. Hampton quickly distinguished himself as a passionate advocate of maintaining public ownership of electricity generation, and published a book on the subject, Public Power, in 2003.

With the selection of Eves as the PC leader, the NDP hoped that the government&#x27;s move to the centre in the spring of 2002 would reduce the polarization of the Ontario electorate between the PCs and Liberals and improve the NDP&#x27;s standing. It was also hoped that the long-standing split between labour and the NDP would be healed as the bitter legacy of the Rae government faded.

The co-chairs of the NDP campaign were Diane O&#x27;Reggio, newly installed as the party&#x27;s provincial secretary after a stint in Ottawa working for the federal party, and Andre Foucault, secretary-treasurer of the Communications Energy and Paperworkers union. The manager was Rob Milling, principal secretary to Hampton. Communications were handled by Sheila White and Gil Hardy. Jeff Ferrier was the media coordinator.

The NDP strategy was to present itself as distinct from the Liberals on the issue of public ownership of public services, primarily in electricity and health care, while downplaying any significant differences between the Liberals and PCs. There was a conscious effort to discourage &quot;strategic voting&quot; where NDP supporters vote Liberal to defeat the Conservatives. The NDP slogan was &quot;publicpower&quot;, designed to highlight both the energy issue Hampton had championed and public health care, while promoting a populist image of empowerment for average people.

The NDP campaign was designed to be highly visual and memorable. Each event was built around a specific visual thematic. For instance, in the first week of the campaign, Hampton attacked the Liberal energy platform saying it was &quot;full of holes&quot; and holding up a copy of the platform with oversized holes punched in it. He also illustrated it &quot;had more holes than Swiss cheese&quot; by also displaying a large block of cheese. At another event, Hampton and his campaign team argued that the Liberal positions were like &quot;trying to nail Jello to the wall&quot; by literally attempting to nail Jello to a wall. Hampton also made an appearance in front of the Toronto home of millionaire Peter Munk to denounce Eves&#x27; tax breaks, claiming that they would save Munk $18,000 a year.

The first round of NDP ads avoided personal attacks, and cast leader Howard Hampton as a champion of public utilities. In one 30-second spot, Mr. Hampton talks about the effects of privatization of the power industry and the blackout. &quot;For most of us, selling off our hydro was the last straw,&quot; he says. The clip is mixed with images of Toronto streets during power failure.

Geographically, the NDP campaign focused on targeting seats in Scarborough and Etobicoke in Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa and Northern Ontario.

==Campaign events==

===Early weeks===
The first week of the campaign was dominated by the Conservatives, who launched a series of highly negative attacks at Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty while highlighting popular elements of their platform. On the first week of the campaign, two polls showed a tight race: a poll done by EKOS for the Toronto Star showed a 1.5% Liberal lead, while a smaller poll done by COMPAS showed a 5% Liberal lead. A poll done by Environics in late June and early July showed a 13-point lead for the Liberals.

As the campaign entered week 2, it was anticipated that the Liberals would push a series of highly negative ads to combat advertising by the Conservatives that attacked Dalton McGuinty. Instead, they went positive and stayed positive throughout the campaign. It was Eves who went on the defensive as the Liberals worked the media to put the Premier on his heels. Stung by years of arrogance by the PC Party toward reporters, the media were quick to pile on.

After the Liberals Gerry Phillips and Gerald M. Butts accused Eves of having no plan to pay for his $10.4 billion in promises, Eves stumbled when he could not provide his own cost for his promises. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t tell you off the top of my head&quot;, he admitted. Then came a story on the front of the Globe and Mail saying that Ontarians would have to pay &quot;millions&quot; in extra premiums because the election call had delayed implementation of new auto insurance regulations promised by Eves on the eve of the campaign. On Wednesday the government was broadsided when – days after a raid at a meat packing plant exposed the sorry state of public health at some abattoirs – leaked documents showed the PC government had been sitting on recommendations to improve meat safety, leading to calls for a public inquiry by the opposition parties. The issue was made worse when Agriculture Minister Helen Johns refused all media calls and had to be literally tracked down in her riding by reporters.

On Thursday, according to the Green party candidate in Nipissing (Mike Harris&#x27; old riding), a donor with Tory connections offered him money to bolster his campaign and draw votes away from the Liberals. The allegations were denied by the Tories. The same day, Eves attacked Dalton McGuinty for voting against a bill to protect taxpayers from increased taxes, when it turns out McGuinty in fact voted for that bill.

===The &quot;Kitten-eater&quot; controversy===
On September 12, the Eves campaign issued a news release that called Dalton McGuinty an &quot;evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet&quot;. The words appeared at the end of the news release. Eves said the epithet was meant as a joke, and acknowledged the words were &quot;over the top&quot;, but refused to apologize.

There is speculation the epithet was an obscure reference to an episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, which McGuinty stated, in a blog post that week, he enjoys watching.

In response, McGuinty said his campaign will not be &quot;sidetracked&quot; by the incident. Despite efforts by two Conservative spies at a Liberal campaign event to shoo away a white kitten, members of the media managed to take photographs of McGuinty holding the kitten, a moment some described as a defining moment of the campaign.

Liberal Party officials made T-shirts that were emblazoned with the words &quot;Call Me An Evil Reptilian Kitten Eater ... But I Want Change&quot;. The T-shirts were handed out to party supporters at a rally held that same night.

===Later weeks===
The Conservatives spent the third week on the defensive and dropping in the polls, unable to recover from the disasters of the second week and fresh new attacks. The Liberals produced documents from the Walkerton Inquiry showing that individual Conservative MPPs were warned about risks to human health and safety resulting from cuts to the Environment Ministry budget. An attack on Dalton McGuinty saying he needed &quot;professional help&quot; forced an apology from the Conservatives to people with mental illness. Tory MPP John O&#x27;Toole said the Tory negative campaign was a mistake, putting Eves on the defensive once again. A leaked memo was used by the opposition to accuse the government of threatening public sector workers into not telling the truth at a public inquiry into the government&#x27;s handling of the SARS crisis. Eves ended the week with another event that backfired, brandishing barbed wire and a get out of jail free card to attack the Liberals as soft on crime. Reporters spent more time focused on Eves&#x27; first use of props in the election than on his message.

By the fourth week of the campaign, polls showed the Liberals pulling away from the Conservatives with a margin of at least 10 points. It was widely believed that only a disastrous performance in the leader&#x27;s debate stood between Dalton McGuinty and the Premier&#x27;s Office. McGuinty - who had stumbled badly in the 1999 debate - was able to play off low expectations and a surprisingly low-key Eves to earn the draw he wanted. The debate itself was also subject to criticism from the Green Party of Ontario, which denounced a Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission decision not to allow leader Frank de Jong to participate.

The final week of the campaign was marred by more negative attacks from Eves and the Conservatives. At one point, Premier Eves referred to Mr. McGuinty as having a &quot;pointy head&quot;, a remark he later conceded was inappropriate. McGuinty was able to extend the bad press from the incident another day when he joked to radio hosts that they needed to be careful &quot;so I won&#x27;t spear you with my sharp pointy head.&quot;

McGuinty spent the last days of the campaign travelling through previously rock solid PC territory in ridings like Durham, Simcoe and Leeds-Grenville to large crowds.

===Issues===
The campaign was contentious on the issues as well, with both the Liberals and Howard Hampton&#x27;s New Democrats attacking the Tories&#x27; record in office. Various scandals and other unpopular moves reduced public opinion of the Tories going into the race, including the Walkerton water tragedy, the deaths of Dudley George and Kimberly Rogers, the possible sale of publicly owned electric utility Hydro One, the SARS outbreak, the decision to release the 2003 budget at an auto parts factory instead of the Legislature, the widespread blackout in August, and the Aylmer packing plant tainted meat investigation. As one Tory insider put it: &quot;So many chickens came to roost, it&#x27;s like a remake of &quot;The Birds&quot;&quot;.

One of the most contentious issues was education. All three parties pledged to increase spending by $2 billion, but Premier Eves also pledged to ban teacher strikes, lock-outs, and work-to-rule campaigns during the school year, a move the other parties rejected. Teacher strikes had plagued the previous Progressive Conservative mandate of Mike Harris, whose government had deeply cut education spending.

Tax cuts were also an issue. The Progressive Conservatives proposed a wide range of tax cuts, including a 20-percent cut to personal income taxes, and the elimination of education tax paid by seniors, two moves that would have cost $1.3 billion together. The Liberals and New Democrats rejected these cuts as profligate. The Liberals also promised to cancel some pending Tory tax cuts and to eliminate some tax cuts already introduced.

==Assessment==

CBC Newsworld declared a Liberal victory minutes after ballot-counting began. Ernie Eves conceded defeat only ninety minutes into the count.

The Liberals won a huge majority with 72 seats, almost 70% of the 106-seat legislature. The Liberals not only won almost every seat in the city of Toronto, but every seat bordering on Toronto as well. All seven seats in Peel region went Liberal, as well as previously safe PC 905 seats such as Markham, Oakville and Pickering—Ajax. The Liberals also made a major breakthrough in Southwestern Ontario, grabbing all three seats in London as well as rural seats such as Perth–Middlesex, Huron–Bruce and Lambton–Kent. If the story of the PC majorities in 1995 and 1999 were the marriage of rural and small-town conservative bedrock with voters in the suburbs, the 2003 election was a divorce of those suburban voters from rural Ontario and a new marriage to the mid-town professionals and New Canadians who make up the Liberal base.

The NDP had a disappointingly confusing election: on one hand, they won seven seats, one fewer than the eight required to keep &quot;official party status&quot;, which would give it a share of official Queen&#x27;s Park staff, money for research, and guaranteed time during Question Period. On the other hand, they increased their share of the popular vote for the first time since 1990. Despite the mixed results, Hampton stayed on as party leader, saying that the party did not blame him for the poor performance. The party was returned to official party status seven months into the session, when Andrea Horwath won a by-election in Hamilton East on May 13, 2004.

The Tories were completely shut out of Toronto, where 19 out of 22 ridings were won by the Liberals, and the remaining three were carried by the New Democrats. Perhaps more ominously for the PCs, they were also shut out of any seats bordering Toronto; only in the outermost suburbs like Aurora and Whitby were high-profile PC cabinet ministers able to retain their seats. With the arguable exception of Elizabeth Witmer, no PC member represented an urban riding.

The 38th Parliament of Ontario opened on November 19, 2003, at 3 p.m. Eastern Time with a Throne Speech in which the McGuinty government laid out their agenda.

===Student vote===
High school students in every riding in Ontario were allowed to cast ballots in their classrooms as part of a student vote, although their numbers did not count in the official election. 93 ridings favoured the Liberals in the student vote, nine favoured the New Democrats, and one favoured the Greens, while the Conservatives were shut out. There was also a vote for elementary students.

The following were among the Independent candidates:

* Ten ran as &quot;Independent Renewal&quot; candidates. This was the Marxist-Leninist Party under another name.
* Candidates from the Independent Reform Party and Communist League also ran as independents.
* Costas Manios ran as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; candidate after being denied the opportunity to run for the Liberal Party nomination in Scarborough Centre. Outgoing MPP Claudette Boyer had sat in the house as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; from 2001 to 2003.

===Synopsis of results===
: = open seat
: = turnout is above provincial average
: = incumbent re-elected
: = incumbency arose from byelection gain

<text>Breaking the Ice is a peace project founded by Heskel Nathaniel.

==Breaking the Ice==
Breaking the Ice is an international non-profit foundation that brings together people from different cultures, viewpoints or sides of a conflict in the hope of overcoming the barriers of mistrust, misunderstanding and fear that are the root causes of conflict and violence in our world.
Breaking the Ice was founded by Nathaniel and other European international business professionals, who are deeply convinced that people can overcome their differences by facing challenges together. In 2004, the foundation brought eight people from Israel and the Palestinian territories together in a month-long sailing and mountain climbing expedition to Antarctica. Their journey to break the ice received the support and public endorsements of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates the Dalai Lama, Shimon Peres, Mikhail Gorbachev, Kofi Annan, and many more. Furthermore, their journey also received worldwide media coverage on channels like CNN, BBC, etc. as well as international newspapers. More than 553 million people in 59 countries and 25 languages followed the story of Breaking the Ice.

Breaking the Ice is currently planning its next &quot;peace mission&quot; for March 2006

===The team===
Men and women - Jews, Christians and Muslims - from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and the United States will join in mind, body and spirit to cross the Sahara Desert and the territories of five countries and cultures. The identities of the team will be disclosed shortly before the journey begins.

===The route===
Setting off on March 1, 2006, the team will embark on a three-week journey from Jerusalem to Tripoli, crossing one of the harshest terrains on the planet.

===The challenge===
The diverse team members will confront physical and spiritual terrain that has witnessed conflict throughout the centuries. Testing themselves against the challenges of their surroundings and their own conflicting relationships, they can only succeed if they rely on and trust one another.

===News coverage===
A news broadcasting team will accompany the journey and transmit daily coverage to international TV, print media, radio and the Internet.

===Documentary===
A film production crew will film the journey. Oscar-winning editor Pietro Scalia, whose feature film credits include &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot; and &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, will serve as editorial supervisor for the production of the documentary.

<doc id="333292" wikidata="Q469971" url="?curid=333292" title="Gjon Buzuku">
<text>Gjon Buzuku ( – ) was an Albanian Catholic priest and a prominent Old Albanian author, who wrote the first known printed book in Albanian. Commonly referred to as the &quot;Missal&quot;, this book is considered an important monument of Albanian studies, being the oldest source for studying the Albanian language.

== Life ==
Very little that is known about Gjon Buzuku comes from the last page of his book, where he mentions being the son of a certain Bdek (Benedict) Buzuku. In the same text he also informs about his service as a priest in a church not far away from where the printers workshop was located. Most scholars agree that this was in Venice.

From March 20, 1554, to January 5, 1555, he wrote a translation of the Catholic missal into the Gheg dialect of Albanian. He published it as a book of 220 pages. The Apostolic Library in the Vatican holds the only known copy of the book. It is missing the frontispiece and the first 16 sheets, which explains why the title and year of publication of the work are not known. Buzuku gives a few clues on his motives in the short text at the end,

I, John, son of Benedict Buzuku, having often considered that our language had in it nothing intelligible from the Holy Scriptures, wished for the sake of our people to attempt, as far as I was able, to enlighten the minds of those who understand, so that they may comprehend how great and powerful and forgiving our Lord is to those who love him with all their hearts. I beg of you from today on to go to church more often to hear the word of God.

Based from the Albanian dialect used, it is obvious that Buzuku came from a Gheg area of Albanian milieu. Sometimes this is defined further to be in the village of Brisk Posht in Shestan near Krajë region, close to Northern Albania (Krajë is located on the shores of Shkodra Lake), then Ottoman Empire. Not much else is known about Buzuku. His presence is not recorded in any of the archival documents of the time. It remains to be seen if a recent discovery from the archives of Padova might add a few more details. A certain Gjon Buzuku is recorded there at the University of Padova finishing his doctoral studies in 1567.

== The first Albanian book ==

Considered to be the oldest published book in Albanian, &quot;Meshari&quot; was discovered in 1740 by Gjon Nikollë Kazazi, the archbishop of Skopje. In other libraries there are three photocopies from the original, one of them in Tirana. In 1996, the librarians were not able to locate the book, which had been used in 1984 for the last time. Eqrem Çabej wrote a monograph on the book in 1968. The dialect used in &quot;Meshari&quot; was one of the main subjects of Selman Riza&#x27;s works.

The place the book was printed is thought to be either Venice or Shkodër. Though recent studies by Lucia Nadin give convincing evidence that make Venice as the place where Meshari was printed. According to Nadin, it was at the workshop of Bernardino Bindoni that this might have happened. Another hypothesis is that it was printed at the workshop of the Scotto family in Venice.

The book contains the liturgies of the main holidays. There are also texts of prayers and rituals and catechetical texts. Every page contains two columns. The initials are decorated. The grammar and the vocabulary are more archaic than in the Gheg text from the 17th century. The text is very valuable from the viewpoint of the history of language. The vocabulary is quite rich. The archaic text is easily read due to the circumstance that it is mainly a translation of known texts, in particular the Bible. Most of the Gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were translated in the book. It also contains passages from the Psalms, the Book of Isaiah, the Book of Jeremiah, the Letters to the Corinthians, and many illustrations.

The orthography is peculiar. The Latin alphabet with some additional letters is used. The consequent character of orthography and grammar seems to indicate an earlier tradition of writing.

In Albanian, the book is known as &quot;Meshari&quot; (&quot;The Missal&quot;). All we know about the author is from the book&#x27;s colophon written by Buzuku himself in Albanian. The language used is a pre-runner to the official Gheg dialect of Albanian. However, it is clear that the Gheg dialect was used. Even today one can hear words and expressions from older Malësians that sound as if jumping from the pages of the missal.

<doc id="333293" wikidata="Q1892828" url="?curid=333293" title="Red Leicester">
<text>Red Leicester (also known simply as Leicester or Leicestershire cheese) (, ) is an English cheese similar to Cheddar cheese, but crumbly in texture. It is typically aged 6 to 12 months. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. Since the 18th century, it has been coloured orange by the addition of annatto extract during manufacture. It is a cow&#x27;s milk cheese, and is named after the city of Leicester, or the ceremonial county it is located in, Leicestershire. 

Traditionally made wheels are fairly firm and dry, with a friable texture and a slightly sweet, mellow flavour that becomes stronger as the cheese matures. Block-made cheeses are moister, and they have a slightly sweet aftertaste and a creamy texture. The cheese has a slightly nutty taste. Versions sold in supermarkets are typically coloured with annatto, although it is possible to obtain Red Leicester without it.

Red Leicester is aged anywhere from four to nine months. &quot;Young&quot; Leicesters, at the beginning of that range, will be very mild; it is usually after six months that a Leicester begins to develop enough of a tang to be classified as &quot;old&quot;.
The modern industrial method for ageing is with vacuum packing. Smaller &quot;farmhouse&quot; makers usually still use the traditional way of maturing it in cloth, for a better flavour development.

== History ==
The cheese was originally made on farms in Leicestershire, England, with surplus milk, once all the Stilton desired was made. It was originally coloured with carrot or beetroot juice.

It used to be called Leicestershire Cheese but came to be called Red Leicester. This was to distinguish it from &quot;White Leicester,&quot; which was made to a national wartime recipe in the 1940s due to rationing.

When fresh, the fat content of Red Leicester cheese is generally 33 to 34%. Regulations require that minimum fat levels to be stated in terms of the &quot;fat in dry matter&quot; or FDM. This is because moisture levels decrease as cheese ages. FDM measures the amount of fat present in the solids, which includes protein, minerals, vitamins and salt. The minimum FDM listed for Red Leicester is generally 48%.

<doc id="333296" wikidata="Q7492733" url="?curid=333296" title="Sheffield Rally">
<text>The Sheffield Rally was a political event held by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Labour Party on Wednesday 1 April 1992, a week ahead of the 1992 general election on 9 April.

==The event==
An event in preparation for eighteen months, the rally was held at the Sheffield Arena, an indoor sports venue in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It was attended by 10,000 Labour Party members, including the entire shadow cabinet, and is reported to have cost some £100,000 to stage. It was the idea of strategist Philip Gould, who was involved in the subsequent successful election campaign of Bill Clinton, who was elected as President of the United States later that year. Neil Kinnock, the leader of the Labour Party, was flown into the city by helicopter.

The rally was modelled partly on American presidential campaign conventions, with sound and light performances on the stage and celebrity endorsements played on a large video screen. At one point in the proceedings, Kinnock and the shadow cabinet paraded to the stage from the back of the venue, passing through an increasingly enthusiastic audience, with the shadow cabinet being introduced with titles such as &quot;The next Home Secretary&quot; (in reference to Roy Hattersley) and &quot;The next Prime Minister&quot; (in reference to Kinnock); Labour had been in opposition for 13 years and had lost the previous three consecutive general elections, in 1979, 1983 and 1987, to the Conservatives.

This culminated in an emotional and animated Kinnock taking the podium and shouting a phrase four times which was generally reported as &quot;We&#x27;re all right!&quot;, although Kinnock would later claim the phrase was &quot;Well all right!&quot; shouted &quot;in the manner of a rock and roll singer.&quot; The footage has often been re-broadcast since as an example of overconfident campaigning. Kinnock followed this by proclaiming &quot;We&#x27;d better get some talking done here, serious talking.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Although Labour&#x27;s internal polls at the time suggested the event had little effect on the level of support for the party, media commentators, and some prominent Labour politicians, thought the rally came over as &quot;triumphalist&quot; to television viewers of subsequent news programmes.

The Conservatives won the election eight days later, finishing eight percentage points ahead of Labour in voting, but with a much smaller parliamentary majority than in 1987. It is widely regarded as one of the most surprising election results of the 20th century, as pollsters had predicted a small Labour majority or a hung parliament.

Mirroring Labour&#x27;s poll results, several analysts and major participants in the campaign believe it actually had little effect. Jim Parish, senior campaigns officer for the Labour Party from 1985 to 1993 and an organiser of the rally, wrote: &quot;The catastrophic 6–7 per cent drop in Labour support occurred before the rally and was – I am reliably informed – known in Sheffield that night.&quot; Polls conducted in the final week of the campaign continued to show either the two main parties neck-and-neck or Labour slightly ahead, as they had done prior to the rally. 

Some accounts suggest the event only received widespread attention after the election, an opinion Kinnock shared in an April 2010 &quot;New Statesman&quot; interview: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until about ten days after the election that people started writing about the &#x27;hubristic Sheffield rally&#x27; and all the rest of it.&quot; 

In fact, the rally was discussed several times during the BBC&#x27;s election-night coverage; David Dimbleby questioned Labour&#x27;s then Shadow Chancellor, John Smith, about the hubristic nature of the rally; BBC commentator David Davies suggested it may have hurt Labour in the Midlands, being seen as &quot;too self-congratulatory, too soon&quot;; and both Conservative David Mellor and Shirley Williams of the SDP discussed it in a roundtable conversation.

In a 1995 interview for the BBC Two documentary series &quot;The Wilderness Years&quot;, Kinnock said: &quot;...all of the years in which I&#x27;d attempted to build a fairly reserved, starchy persona – in a few seconds, they slipped away.&quot; In the 2010 &quot;New Statesman&quot; interview, Kinnock expressed a different opinion on the effect of his performance at the rally. He said: &quot;Given my time again, I wouldn&#x27;t repeat it – but the great legend is complete, bloody rubbish.&quot;

In 2021, writing on Kinnock&#x27;s failure to become Prime Minister, Steve Richards argued that the rally had &quot;acquired a mythological status as fatal event&quot;, but noted that prior to Labour&#x27;s defeat &quot;there was no suggestion that Kinnock had made a terrible blunder&quot;. He noted that the BBC&#x27;s political editor John Cole had indicated he had been impressed in his live reporting of the rally and it was only retrospectively that it started to be portrayed as showing Kinnock as &quot;overconfident and cocky&quot;. Richards concluded that blaming the event for Labour&#x27;s defeat was &quot;a red herring&quot; and the party would have lost the election even if there had been no Sheffield Rally.

The event is often mentioned in relation to other purported political miscalculations or gaffes, such as the Paul Wellstone memorial during the 2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota. or the Howard Dean &quot;Dean Scream&quot; incident.

<text>A regular polyhedron is a polyhedron whose symmetry group acts transitively on its flags. A regular polyhedron is highly symmetrical, being all of edge-transitive, vertex-transitive and face-transitive. In classical contexts, many different equivalent definitions are used; a common one is that the faces are congruent regular polygons which are assembled in the same way around each vertex.

A regular polyhedron is identified by its Schläfli symbol of the form {&quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;}, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of sides of each face and &quot;m&quot; the number of faces meeting at each vertex. There are 5 finite convex regular polyhedra (the Platonic solids), and four regular star polyhedra (the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra), making nine regular polyhedra in all. In addition, there are five regular compounds of the regular polyhedra.

== The regular polyhedra ==

There are five convex regular polyhedra, known as the Platonic solids; four regular star polyhedra, the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra; and five regular compounds of regular polyhedra:

=== Platonic solids ===


=== Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra ===

=== Regular compounds ===


== Characteristics ==
===Equivalent properties===

The property of having a similar arrangement of faces around each vertex can be replaced by any of the following equivalent conditions in the definition:

*The vertices of a convex regular polyhedron all lie on a sphere.
*All the dihedral angles of the polyhedron are equal
*All the vertex figures of the polyhedron are regular polygons.
*All the solid angles of the polyhedron are congruent.

===Concentric spheres===

A convex regular polyhedron has all of three related spheres (other polyhedra lack at least one kind) which share its centre:
* An insphere, tangent to all faces.
* An intersphere or midsphere, tangent to all edges.
* A circumsphere, tangent to all vertices.

===Symmetry===

The regular polyhedra are the most symmetrical of all the polyhedra. They lie in just three symmetry groups, which are named after the Platonic solids:
*Tetrahedral
*Octahedral (or cubic)
*Icosahedral (or dodecahedral)

Any shapes with icosahedral or octahedral symmetry will also contain tetrahedral symmetry.

===Euler characteristic===

The five Platonic solids have an Euler characteristic of 2. This simply reflects that the surface is a topological 2-sphere, and so is also true, for example, of
any polyhedron which is star-shaped with respect to some interior point.

===Interior points===

The sum of the distances from any point in the interior of a regular polyhedron to the sides is independent of the location of the point (this is an extension of Viviani&#x27;s theorem.) However, the converse does not hold, not even for tetrahedra.

== Duality of the regular polyhedra ==
In a dual pair of polyhedra, the vertices of one polyhedron correspond to the faces of the other, and vice versa.

The regular polyhedra show this duality as follows:
* The tetrahedron is self-dual, i.e. it pairs with itself.
* The cube and octahedron are dual to each other.
* The icosahedron and dodecahedron are dual to each other.
* The small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are dual to each other.
* The great stellated dodecahedron and great icosahedron are dual to each other.

The Schläfli symbol of the dual is just the original written backwards, for example the dual of {5, 3} is {3, 5}.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===

Stones carved in shapes resembling clusters of spheres or knobs have been found in Scotland and may be as much as 4,000 years old. Some of these stones show not only the symmetries of the five Platonic solids, but also some of the relations of duality amongst them (that is, that the centres of the faces of the cube gives the vertices of an octahedron). Examples of these stones are on display in the John Evans room of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. Why these objects were made, or how their creators gained the inspiration for them, is a mystery. There is doubt regarding the mathematical interpretation of these objects, as many have non-platonic forms, and perhaps only one has been found to be a true icosahedron, as opposed to a reinterpretation of the icosahedron dual, the dodecahedron.

It is also possible that the Etruscans preceded the Greeks in their awareness of at least some of the regular polyhedra, as evidenced by the discovery near Padua (in Northern Italy) in the late 19th century of a dodecahedron made of soapstone, and dating back more than 2,500 years (Lindemann, 1987).

=== Greeks ===

The earliest known &quot;written&quot; records of the regular convex solids originated from Classical Greece. When these solids were all discovered and by whom is not known, but Theaetetus (an Athenian) was the first to give a mathematical description of all five (Van der Waerden, 1954), (Euclid, book XIII). H.S.M. Coxeter (Coxeter, 1948, Section 1.9) credits Plato (400 BC) with having made models of them, and mentions that one of the earlier Pythagoreans, Timaeus of Locri, used all five in a correspondence between the polyhedra and the nature of the universe as it was then perceived – this correspondence is recorded in Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot;. Euclid&#x27;s reference to Plato led to their common description as the &quot;Platonic solids&quot;.

One might characterise the Greek definition as follows:
*A regular polygon is a (convex) planar figure with all edges equal and all corners equal.
*A regular polyhedron is a solid (convex) figure with all faces being congruent regular polygons, the same number arranged all alike around each vertex.

This definition rules out, for example, the square pyramid (since although all the faces are regular, the square base is not congruent to the triangular sides), or the shape formed by joining two tetrahedra together (since although all faces of that triangular bipyramid would be equilateral triangles, that is, congruent and regular, some vertices have 3 triangles and others have 4).

This concept of a regular polyhedron would remain unchallenged for almost 2000 years.

=== Regular star polyhedra ===

Regular star polygons such as the pentagram (star pentagon) were also known to the ancient Greeks – the pentagram was used by the Pythagoreans as their secret sign, but they did not use them to construct polyhedra. It was not until the early 17th century that Johannes Kepler realised that pentagrams could be used as the faces of regular star polyhedra. Some of these star polyhedra may have been discovered by others before Kepler&#x27;s time, but Kepler was the first to recognise that they could be considered &quot;regular&quot; if one removed the restriction that regular polyhedra be convex. Two hundred years later Louis Poinsot also allowed star vertex figures (circuits around each corner), enabling him to discover two new regular star polyhedra along with rediscovering Kepler&#x27;s. These four are the only regular star polyhedra, and have come to be known as the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra. It was not until the mid-19th century, several decades after Poinsot published, that Cayley gave them their modern English names: (Kepler&#x27;s) small stellated dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron, and (Poinsot&#x27;s) great icosahedron and great dodecahedron.

The Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra may be constructed from the Platonic solids by a process called stellation. The reciprocal process to stellation is called facetting (or faceting). Every stellation of one polyhedron is dual, or reciprocal, to some facetting of the dual polyhedron. The regular star polyhedra can also be obtained by facetting the Platonic solids. This was first done by Bertrand around the same time that Cayley named them.

By the end of the 19th century there were therefore nine regular polyhedra – five convex and four star.

== Regular polyhedra in nature ==
Each of the Platonic solids occurs naturally in one form or another.

The tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron all occur as crystals. These by no means exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals (Smith, 1982, p212), of which there are 48. Neither the regular icosahedron nor the regular dodecahedron are amongst them, but crystals can have the shape of a pyritohedron, which is visually almost indistinguishable from a regular dodecahedron. Truly icosahedral crystals may be formed by quasicrystalline materials which are very rare in nature but can be produced in a laboratory.

A more recent discovery is of a series of new types of carbon molecule, known as the fullerenes (see Curl, 1991). Although C60, the most easily produced fullerene, looks more or less spherical, some of the larger varieties (such as C240, C480 and C960) are hypothesised to take on the form of slightly rounded icosahedra, a few nanometres across.

Regular polyhedra appear in biology as well. The coccolithophore &quot;Braarudosphaera bigelowii&quot; has a regular dodecahedral structure, about 10 micrometres across. In the early 20th century, Ernst Haeckel described a number of species of radiolarians, some of whose shells are shaped like various regular polyhedra. Examples include &quot;Circoporus octahedrus&quot;, &quot;Circogonia icosahedra&quot;, &quot;Lithocubus geometricus&quot; and &quot;Circorrhegma dodecahedra&quot;; the shapes of these creatures are indicated by their names. The outer protein shells of many viruses form regular polyhedra. For example, HIV is enclosed in a regular icosahedron, as is the head of a typical myovirus.


In ancient times the Pythagoreans believed that there was a harmony between the regular polyhedra and the orbits of the planets. In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler studied data on planetary motion compiled by Tycho Brahe and for a decade tried to establish the Pythagorean ideal by finding a match between the sizes of the polyhedra and the sizes of the planets&#x27; orbits. His search failed in its original objective, but out of this research came Kepler&#x27;s discoveries of the Kepler solids as regular polytopes, the realisation that the orbits of planets are not circles, and the laws of planetary motion for which he is now famous. In Kepler&#x27;s time only five planets (excluding the earth) were known, nicely matching the number of Platonic solids. Kepler&#x27;s work, and the discovery since that time of Uranus and Neptune, have invalidated the Pythagorean idea.

Around the same time as the Pythagoreans, Plato described a theory of matter in which the five elements (earth, air, fire, water and spirit) each comprised tiny copies of one of the five regular solids. Matter was built up from a mixture of these polyhedra, with each substance having different proportions in the mix. Two thousand years later Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory would show this idea to be along the right lines, though not related directly to the regular solids.

== Further generalisations ==
The 20th century saw a succession of generalisations of the idea of a regular polyhedron, leading to several new classes.

=== Regular skew apeirohedra ===

In the first decades, Coxeter and Petrie allowed &quot;saddle&quot; vertices with alternating ridges and valleys, enabling them to construct three infinite folded surfaces which they called regular skew polyhedra. Coxeter offered a modified Schläfli symbol {l,m|n} for these figures, with {l,m} implying the vertex figure, with &quot;m&quot; regular &quot;l&quot;-gons around a vertex. The &quot;n&quot; defines &quot;n&quot;-gonal &quot;holes&quot;. Their vertex figures are regular skew polygons, vertices zig-zagging between two planes.

=== Regular skew polyhedra ===
Finite regular skew polyhedra exist in 4-space. These finite regular skew polyhedra in 4-space can be seen as a subset of the faces of uniform 4-polytopes. They have planar regular polygon faces, but regular skew polygon vertex figures.

Two dual solutions are related to the 5-cell, two dual solutions are related to the 24-cell, and an infinite set of self-dual duoprisms generate regular skew polyhedra as {4, 4 n}. In the infinite limit these approach a duocylinder and look like a torus in their stereographic projections into 3-space.

=== Regular polyhedra in non-Euclidean and other spaces ===
Studies of non-Euclidean (hyperbolic and elliptic) and other spaces such as complex spaces, discovered over the preceding century, led to the discovery of more new polyhedra such as complex polyhedra which could only take regular geometric form in those spaces.

==== Regular polyhedra in hyperbolic space ====
In H3 hyperbolic space, paracompact regular honeycombs have Euclidean tiling facets and vertex figures that act like finite polyhedra. Such tilings have an angle defect that can be closed by bending one way or the other. If the tiling is properly scaled, it will &quot;close&quot; as an asymptotic limit at a single ideal point. These Euclidean tilings are inscribed in a horosphere just as polyhedra are inscribed in a sphere (which contains zero ideal points). The sequence extends when hyperbolic tilings are themselves used as facets of noncompact hyperbolic tessellations, as in the heptagonal tiling honeycomb {7,3,3}; they are inscribed in an equidistant surface (a 2-hypercycle), which has two ideal points.

==== Regular tilings of the real projective plane ====
Another group of regular polyhedra comprise tilings of the real projective plane. These include the hemi-cube, hemi-octahedron, hemi-dodecahedron, and hemi-icosahedron. They are (globally) projective polyhedra, and are the projective counterparts of the Platonic solids. The tetrahedron does not have a projective counterpart as it does not have pairs of parallel faces which can be identified, as the other four Platonic solids do.

These occur as dual pairs in the same way as the original Platonic solids do. Their Euler characteristics are all 1.

=== Abstract regular polyhedra ===
By now, polyhedra were firmly understood as three-dimensional examples of more general &quot;polytopes&quot; in any number of dimensions. The second half of the century saw the development of abstract algebraic ideas such as Polyhedral combinatorics, culminating in the idea of an abstract polytope as a partially ordered set (poset) of elements. The elements of an abstract polyhedron are its body (the maximal element), its faces, edges, vertices and the &quot;null polytope&quot; or empty set. These abstract elements can be mapped into ordinary space or &quot;realised&quot; as geometrical figures. Some abstract polyhedra have well-formed or &quot;faithful&quot; realisations, others do not. A &quot;flag&quot; is a connected set of elements of each dimension – for a polyhedron that is the body, a face, an edge of the face, a vertex of the edge, and the null polytope. An abstract polytope is said to be &quot;regular&quot; if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags – that is to say, that any flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. Abstract regular polytopes remain an active area of research.

Five such regular abstract polyhedra, which can not be realised faithfully, were identified by H. S. M. Coxeter in his book &quot;Regular Polytopes&quot; (1977) and again by J. M. Wills in his paper &quot;The combinatorially regular polyhedra of index 2&quot; (1987). All five have C2×S5 symmetry but can only be realised with half the symmetry, that is C2×A5 or icosahedral symmetry. They are all topologically equivalent to toroids. Their construction, by arranging &quot;n&quot; faces around each vertex, can be repeated indefinitely as tilings of the hyperbolic plane. In the diagrams below, the hyperbolic tiling images have colors corresponding to those of the polyhedra images.

==== Petrie dual====

The Petrie dual of a regular polyhedron is a regular map whose vertices and edges correspond to the vertices and edges of the original polyhedron, and whose faces are the set of skew Petrie polygons.

=== Spherical polyhedra ===
The usual five regular polyhedra can also be represented as spherical tilings (tilings of the sphere):


==== Regular polyhedra that can only exist as spherical polyhedra ====

For a regular polyhedron whose Schläfli symbol is {&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;}, the number of polygonal faces may be found by:

:formula_1

The Platonic solids known to antiquity are the only integer solutions for &quot;m&quot; ≥ 3 and &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3. The restriction &quot;m&quot; ≥ 3 enforces that the polygonal faces must have at least three sides.

When considering polyhedra as a spherical tiling, this restriction may be relaxed, since digons (2-gons) can be represented as spherical lunes, having non-zero area. Allowing &quot;m&quot; = 2 admits a new infinite class of regular polyhedra, which are the hosohedra. On a spherical surface, the regular polyhedron {2, &quot;n&quot;} is represented as &quot;n&quot; abutting lunes, with interior angles of 2/&quot;n&quot;. All these lunes share two common vertices.

A regular dihedron, {&quot;n&quot;, 2} (2-hedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered a degenerate prism consisting of two (planar) &quot;n&quot;-sided polygons connected &quot;back-to-back&quot;, so that the resulting object has no depth, analogously to how a digon can be constructed with two line segments. However, as a spherical tiling, a dihedron can exist as nondegenerate form, with two &quot;n&quot;-sided faces covering the sphere, each face being a hemisphere, and vertices around a great circle. It is &quot;regular&quot; if the vertices are equally spaced.

The hosohedron {2,&quot;n&quot;} is dual to the dihedron {&quot;n&quot;,2}. Note that when &quot;n&quot; = 2, we obtain the polyhedron {2,2}, which is both a hosohedron and a dihedron. All of these have Euler characteristic 2.

<text>Operation Storm () was the last major battle of the Croatian War of Independence and a major factor in the outcome of the Bosnian War. It was a decisive victory for the Croatian Army (HV), which attacked across a front against the self-declared proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and a strategic victory for the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). The HV was supported by the Croatian special police advancing from the Velebit Mountain, and the ARBiH located in the Bihać pocket, in the Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina&#x27;s (ARSK) rear. The battle, launched to restore Croatian control of of territory, representing 18.4% of the territory it claimed, and Bosniak control of Western Bosnia, was the largest European land battle since World War II. Operation Storm commenced at dawn on 4 August 1995 and was declared complete on the evening of 7 August, despite significant mopping-up operations against pockets of resistance lasting until 14 August.

Operation Storm was a strategic victory in the Bosnian War, effectively ending the siege of Bihać and placing the HV, Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the ARBiH in a position to change the military balance of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the subsequent Operation Mistral 2. The operation built on HV and HVO advances made during Operation Summer &#x27;95, when strategic positions allowing the rapid capture of the RSK capital Knin were gained, and on the continued arming and training of the HV since the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, when the RSK was created during the Serb Log Revolution and Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army intervention. The operation itself followed an unsuccessful United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission and diplomatic efforts to settle the conflict.

The HV&#x27;s and ARBiH&#x27;s strategic success was a result of a series of improvements to the armies themselves, and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the HV and the ARBiH. The attack was not immediately successful at all points, but seizing key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability. The HV capture of Bosansko Grahovo, just before the operation, and the special police&#x27;s advance to Gračac, made it nearly impossible to defend Knin. In Lika, two guard brigades quickly cut the ARSK-held area which lacked tactical depth and mobile reserve forces, and they isolated pockets of resistance, positioned a mobile force for a decisive northward thrust into the Karlovac Corps area of responsibility (AOR), and pushed ARSK towards Banovina. The defeat of the ARSK at Glina and Petrinja, after a tough defensive, defeated the ARSK Banija Corps as well since its reserve was pinned down by the ARBiH. The RSK relied on the Republika Srpska and Yugoslav militaries as its strategic reserve, but they did not intervene in the battle. The United States also played a role in the operation by directing Croatia to a military consultancy firm, Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI), that signed a Pentagon licensed contract to advise, train and provide intelligence to the Croatian army.

The HV and the special police suffered 174–211 killed or missing, while the ARSK had 560 soldiers killed. Four UN peacekeepers were also killed. The HV captured 4,000 prisoners of war. The number of Serb civilian deaths is disputed—Croatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing. The Croatian population had been years prior subjected to ethnic cleansing in the areas held by ARSK by rebel Serb forces, with an estimated 170,000–250,000 expelled and hundreds killed. During and after the offensive, around 150,000–200,000 Serbs of the area formerly held by the ARSK had fled and a variety of crimes were committed against some of the remaining civilians there by Croatian forces. The Croatian Serb population who fled were the largest refugee population in Europe prior to the 2022 Ukraine war.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later tried three Croatian generals charged with war crimes and partaking in a joint criminal enterprise designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia, although all three were ultimately acquitted and the tribunal refuted charges of a criminal enterprise. The ICTY concluded that Operation Storm was not aimed at ethnic persecution, as civilians had not been deliberately targeted. The ICTY stated that Croatian Army and Special Police committed a large number of crimes against the Serb population after the artillery assault, but that the state and military leadership was not responsible for their creation and organizing and that Croatia did not have the specific intent of displacing the country&#x27;s Serb minority. However, Croatia adopted discriminatory measures to make it increasingly difficult for Serbs to return. Human Rights Watch reported that the vast majority of the abuses during the operation were committed by Croatian forces and that the abuses continued on a large scale for months afterwards, which included summary executions of Serb civilians and destruction of Serb property. In 2010, Serbia sued Croatia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that the offensive constituted a genocide. In 2015, the court ruled that the offensive was not genocidal and affirmed the ICTY&#x27;s previous findings.

==Background==
In August 1990, an insurgency known as the Log Revolution took place in Croatia centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, as well as in parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. The areas were subsequently formed into an internationally unrecognised proto-state, the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and after it declared its intention to secede from Croatia and join the Republic of Serbia, the Government of the Republic of Croatia declared the RSK a rebellion.

The conflict escalated by March 1991, resulting in the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium on Croatia&#x27;s and the RSK&#x27;s declarations followed, after which the decision came into effect on 8 October. During this period, the RSK initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Croat civilians. In 1991, 84,000 Croats fled Serbian-held territory. Most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993. Hundreds of Croats were murdered and the total number of Croats and other non-Serbs who were expelled range from 170,000 according to the ICTY and up to a quarter of a million people according to Human Rights Watch. By November 1993, fewer than 400 ethnic Croats remained in the United Nations-protected area known as Sector South, while a further 1,500 – 2,000 remained in Sector North.

Croatian forces also engaged in ethnic cleansing against Serbs in eastern and western Slavonia and parts of the Krajina region, though on a more restricted scale and Serb victims numbered less than Croat victims of Serb forces. In 1991, 70,000 Serbs were displaced from Croatian territory. By October 1993, the UNHCR estimated that there was a total of 247,000 Croatian and other non-Serbian displaced persons coming from areas under the control of RSK and 254,000 Serbian displaced persons and refugees from the rest of Croatia, an estimated 87,000 of whom were inhabitants of the United Nations Protected Areas (UNPA&#x27;s).

During this time, Serbs living in Croatian towns, especially those near the front lines, were subjected to various forms of discrimination from being fired from jobs to having bombs planted under their cars or houses. The UNHCR reported that in the Serb-controlled portions of the UNPA&#x27;s, human rights abuses against Croats and non-Serbs were persistent. Some of the Krajina Serb &quot;authorities&quot; continued to be among the most egregious perpetrators of human rights abuses against the residual non-Serb population, as well as Serbs not in agreement with nationalistic policy. Human rights violations included killings, disappearances, beatings, harassment, forced resettlement, or exile, designed to ensure Serbian dominance of the areas. In 1993, the UNHCR also reported a continued series of abuse against Serbs in Croatian government-held areas which included killings, disappearances, physical abuse, illegal detention, harassment and destruction of property.

As the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) increasingly supported the RSK and the Croatian Police proved unable to cope with the situation, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (HV) in November.

The establishment of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September. The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the Battle of the Barracks, the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar.

In January 1992, an agreement to implement the Vance plan designed to stop the fighting was made by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN.

Ending the series of unsuccessful ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. A stalemate developed as the conflict evolved into static trench warfare, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. Serbia continued to support the RSK, but a series of HV advances restored small areas to Croatian control as the siege of Dubrovnik ended, and Operation Maslenica resulted in minor tactical gains.

In response to the HV successes, the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) intermittently attacked a number of Croat towns and villages with artillery and missiles.

As the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, as Bosnian Serbs declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of a 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The referendum was later cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital, Sarajevo, and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In the final days of March, the Bosnian Serb army started shelling Bosanski Brod, and on 4 April, Sarajevo was attacked. By the end of the year, the Bosnian Serb army—renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) after the Republika Srpska state was proclaimed—controlled about 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That proportion would not change significantly over the next two years. Although the war originally pitted Bosnian Serbs against non-Serbs in the country, it evolved into a three-sided conflict by the end of the year, as the Croat–Bosniak War started. The RSK was supported to a limited extent by the Republika Srpska, which launched occasional air raids from Banja Luka and bombarded several cities in Croatia.

==Prelude==
In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać, a theatre of operations in the Bosnian War, entered a critical stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town of Bihać from the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). It was a strategic area and, since June 1993, Bihać had been one of six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Clinton administration felt that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war and lead to a humanitarian disaster greater than any other in the conflict to that point. Amongst the United States, France and the United Kingdom, division existed regarding how to protect the area. The US called for airstrikes against the VRS, but the French and the British opposed them citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops deployed as a part of the UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In turn, the US was unwilling to commit ground troops.

On the other hand, the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move, since French President François Mitterrand discouraged any military intervention, greatly aiding the Serb war effort. The French stance reversed after Jacques Chirac was elected president of France in May 1995, pressuring the British to adopt a more aggressive approach as well.

Denying Bihać to the Serbs was strategically important to Croatia, and General Janko Bobetko, the Chief of the Croatian General Staff, considered the potential fall of Bihać to represent an end to Croatia&#x27;s war effort.

In March 1994, the Washington Agreement was signed, ending the Croat–Bosniak War, and providing Croatia with US military advisors from Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI). The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton in February 1993.

As the UN arms embargo was still in place, MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV for participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace programme. MPRI trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources, including an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Leslie Wayne and in various Serbian media reports, that MPRI may also have provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia, although MPRI, American and Croatian officials denied such claims. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.
The Washington Agreement also resulted in a series of meetings between Croatian and US government and military officials in Zagreb and Washington, D.C. On 29 November 1994, the Croatian representatives proposed to attack Serb-held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to draw away part of the force besieging Bihać and to prevent the town&#x27;s capture by the Serbs. As the US officials gave no response to the proposal, the Croatian General Staff ordered Operation Winter &#x27;94 the same day, to be carried out by the HV and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO)—the main military force of Herzeg-Bosnia. In addition to contributing to the defence of Bihać, the attack shifted the HV&#x27;s and HVO&#x27;s line of contact closer to the RSK&#x27;s supply routes.

In 1994, the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the UN sought to replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR. They formulated the Z-4 Plan giving Serb-majority areas in Croatia substantial autonomy.

After numerous and frequently uncoordinated changes to the proposed plan, including leaking of its draft elements to the press in October, the Z-4 Plan was presented on 30 January 1995. Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might accept it, but Tuđman realised that Milošević, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK, would not accept the plan for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in Kosovo—allowing Croatia to accept the plan with little possibility for it to be implemented. The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, the plan.

In December 1994, Croatia and the RSK made an economic agreement to restore road and rail links, water and gas supplies, and use of a part of the Adria oil pipeline. Even though some of the agreement was never implemented, a section of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway passing through RSK territory near Okučani and the pipeline were both opened. Following a deadly incident that occurred in late April 1995 on the recently opened motorway, Croatia reclaimed all of the RSK&#x27;s territory in western Slavonia during Operation Flash, taking full control of the territory by 4 May, three days after the battle began. In response, the ARSK attacked Zagreb using M-87 Orkan missiles with cluster munitions. Subsequently, Milošević sent a senior Yugoslav Army officer to command the ARSK, along with arms, field officers and thousands of Serbs born in the RSK area who had been forcibly conscripted by the ARSK.

On 17 July, the ARSK and the VRS started a fresh effort to capture Bihać by expanding on gains made during Operation Spider. The move provided the HV with a chance to extend their territorial gains from Operation Winter &#x27;94 by advancing from the Livno valley. On 22 July, Tuđman and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegović signed the Split Agreement for mutual defence, permitting the large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The HV and HVO responded quickly through Operation Summer &#x27;95 (), capturing Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč on 28–29 July. The attack drew some ARSK units away from Bihać, but not as many as expected. However, it put the HV in an excellent position, as it isolated Knin from the Republika Srpska, as well as Yugoslavia.

In late July and early August, there were two more attempts at resurrecting the Z-4 Plan and the 1994 economic agreement. Talks proposed on 28 July were ignored by the RSK, and last-ditch talks were held in Geneva on 3 August. These quickly broke down as Croatia and the RSK rejected a compromise proposed by Thorvald Stoltenberg, a Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, essentially calling for further negotiations at a later date. In addition, the RSK dismissed a set of Croatian demands, including to disarm, and failed to endorse the Z-4 Plan once again. The talks were used by Croatia to prepare diplomatic ground for the imminent Operation Storm, whose planning was completed during the Brijuni Islands meeting between Tuđman and military commanders on 31 July.

The HV initiated large-scale mobilization in late July, soon after General Zvonimir Červenko became its new Chief of General Staff on 15 July. In 2005, the Croatian weekly magazine &quot;Nacional&quot; reported that the U.S. had been actively involved in the preparation, monitoring and initiation of Operation Storm, that the green light from President Clinton was passed on by the US military attache in Zagreb, and the operations were transmitted in real time to Pentagon.

==Order of battle==

The HV operational plan was set out in four separate parts, designated Storm-1 through 4, which were allocated to various corps based upon their individual areas of responsibility (AORs). Each plan was scheduled to take between four and five days. The forces that the HV allocated to attack the RSK were organised into five army corps: Split, Gospić, Karlovac, Zagreb and Bjelovar Corps. A sixth zone was assigned to the Croatian special police inside the Split Corps AOR, near the boundary with the Gospić Corps. The HV Split Corps, located in the far south of the theatre of operations and commanded by Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina, was assigned the Storm-4 plan, which was the primary component of Operation Storm. The Split Corps issued orders for the battle using the name Kozjak-95 instead, which was not an unusual practice. The 30,000-strong Split Corps was opposed by the 10,000-strong ARSK 7th North Dalmatia Corps, headquartered in Knin and commanded by Major General Slobodan Kovačević. The 3,100-strong special police, deployed to the Velebit Mountain on the left flank of the Split Corps, were directly subordinated to the HV General Staff commanded by the Lieutenant General Mladen Markač.

The 25,000-strong HV Gospić Corps was assigned the Storm-3 component of the operation, to the left of the special police zone. It was commanded by Brigadier Mirko Norac, and opposed by the ARSK 15th Lika Corps, headquartered in Korenica and commanded by Major General Stevan Ševo. The Lika Corps, consisting of about 6,000 troops, was sandwiched between the HV Gospić Corps and the ARBiH in the Bihać pocket in ARSK rear, forming a wide but a very shallow area. The ARBiH 5th Corps deployed about 2,000 troops in the zone. The Gospić Corps, assigned a section of the front, was tasked with cutting the RSK in half and linking up with the ARBiH, while the ARBiH was tasked with pinning down ARSK forces that were in contact with the Bihać pocket.

The HV Karlovac Corps, commanded by Major General Miljenko Crnjac, on the left flank of the Gospić Corps, covered the area extending from Ogulin to Karlovac, including Kordun, and executed the Storm-2 plan. The corps was composed of 15,000 troops and was tasked with pinning down the ARSK forces in the area to protect the flanks of the Zagreb and Gospić Corps. It had a forward command post in Ogulin and was opposed by the ARSK 21st Kordun Corps headquartered at Petrova Gora, consisting of 4,000 troops in the AOR (one of its brigades was facing the Zagreb Corps). Initially, the 21st Kordun Corps was commanded by Colonel Veljko Bosanac, but he was replaced by Colonel Čedo Bulat during the evening of 5 August. In addition, the bulk of the ARSK Special Units Corps was present in the area, commanded by Major General Milorad Stupar. ARSK Special Units Corps was 5,000-strong, largely facing the Bihać pocket at the onset of Operation Storm. The ARSK armour and artillery in the AOR outnumbered that of the HV.

The HV Zagreb Corps, assigned the Storm-1 plan, initially commanded by Major General Ivan Basarac, on the left flank of the Karlovac Corps, was deployed on three main axes of attack—towards Glina, Petrinja and Hrvatska Kostajnica. It was opposed by the ARSK 39th Banija Corps, headquartered in Glina and commanded by Major General Slobodan Tarbuk. The Zagreb Corps was tasked with bypassing Petrinja to neutralize ARSK artillery and missiles potentially targeting Croatian cities, making a secondary thrust from Sunja towards Hrvatska Kostajnica. Their secondary mission was compromised when a battalion of the special police and the 81st Guards Battalion planned to spearhead the advance were deployed elsewhere forcing modifications to the plan. The Zagreb Corps was composed of 30,000 troops, while the ARSK had 9,000 facing them and about 1,000 ARBiH troops in the Bihać pocket to their rear. At the start of Operation Storm, about 3,500 ARSK troops were in contact with the ARBiH. HV Bjelovar Corps, on the left flank of the Zagreb Corps, covering the area along the Una River, had a forward command post in Novska. The corps was commanded by Major General Luka Džanko. Opposite the Bjelovar Corps was a part of the ARSK Banija Corps. The Bjelovar Corps was included in the attack on 2 August and were therefore not issued a separate operations plan.

The ARSK divided its forces in the area in two, subordinating the North Dalmatia and Lika Corps to the ARSK General Staff, and grouping the rest into the Kordun Operational Group commanded by Lieutenant Colonel General Mile Novaković. Territorially, the division corresponded to the North and South sectors of the UN protected areas.

Estimates of the total number of troops deployed by the belligerents vary considerably. Croatian forces have been estimated from under 100,000 to 150,000, but most sources put the figure at about 130,000 troops. ARSK troop strength in the Sectors North and South was estimated by the HV prior to Operation Storm at approximately 43,000. More detailed HV estimates of the manpower by individual ARSK corps indicated 34,000 soldiers, while Serb sources quote 27,000 troops. The discrepancy is usually reflected in literature as an estimate of about 30,000 ARSK troops. The ARBiH deployed approximately 3,000 troops against the ARSK positions near Bihać. In late 1994, the Fikret Abdić-led Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB)—a sliver of land northwest of Bihać between its ally RSK and the pocket—commanded 4,000–5,000 soldiers who were deployed south of Velika Kladuša against the ARBiH force.



==Operation timeline==

===4 August 1995===
Operation Storm started at 5 a.m. on 4 August 1995 when coordinated attacks were executed by reconnaissance and sabotage detachments in concert with Croatian Air Force (CAF) air strikes aimed at disrupting ARSK command, control, and communications. UN peacekeepers, known as United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation (UNCRO), were notified three hours in advance of the attack when Tuđman&#x27;s chief of staff, Hrvoje Šarinić, telephoned UNCRO commander, French Army General Bernard Janvier. In addition, each HV corps notified the UNCRO sector in its path of the attack, requesting written confirmations of receipt of the information. The UNCRO relayed the information to the RSK, confirming the warnings RSK received from the Yugoslav Army General Staff the previous day.

====Sector South====

In the Split Corps AOR, at 5 a.m. the 7th Guards Brigade advanced south from Bosansko Grahovo towards the high ground ahead of Knin after a period of artillery preparation. Moving against the ARSK 3rd Battlegroup, consisting of elements of the North Dalmatian Corps and RSK police, the 7th Guards achieved its objectives for the day and allowed the 4th Guards Brigade to attack. The HV Sinj Operational Group (OG), on the left flank of the two brigades, joined the attack and the 126th Home Guard Regiment captured Uništa, gaining control of the area overlooking the Sinj–Knin road. The 144th Brigade and the 6th Home Guard Regiment also pushed ARSK forces back. The Šibenik OG units faced the ARSK 75th Motorized Brigade and a part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the ARSK North Dalmatian Corps. There, the 142nd and the 15th Home Guard Regiments made minor progress in the area between Krka and Drniš, while the 113th Infantry Brigade made a slightly greater advance on their left flank, to Čista Velika. In the Zadar OG area, the 134th Home Guard Regiment (without its 2nd Battalion) failed to advance, while the 7th Home Guard Regiment and the 112th HV Brigade gained little ground against the ARSK 92nd Motorized and 3rd Infantry Brigades at Benkovac. On the Velebit, the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade, reinforced with a company from the 7th Home Guard Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 134th Home Guard Regiment met stiff resistance but advanced sufficiently to secure use of the Obrovac–Sveti Rok road. At 4:45 p.m., a decision to evacuate the population in the Northern Dalmatia and Lika areas was made by RSK President Milan Martić. According to RSK Major General Milisav Sekulić, Martić ordered the evacuation hoping to coax Milošević and the international community to help the RSK. Nonetheless, the evacuation was extended the whole sectors North and South, except Kordun region. In the evening the ARSK Main Staff moved from Knin to Srb, about to the northwest.

At 5 a.m., Croatian special police advanced to the Mali Alan pass on the Velebit, encountering strong resistance from the ARSK Lika Corps&#x27; 4th Light Brigade and elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade. The pass was captured at 1 p.m., and Sveti Rok village was captured at about 5 p.m. The special police advanced further beyond Mali Alan, meeting more resistance at 9 p.m. and then bivouacking until 5 a.m. The ARSK 9th Motorized Brigade withdrew to Udbina after being forced out of its positions on the Velebit. In the morning, the special police captured Lovinac, Gračac and Medak.

In the Gospić Corps AOR, the 138th Home Guard Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade began an eastward attack in the Mala Kapela area in the morning, meeting heavy resistance from the ARSK 70th Infantry Brigade. The rest of the 1st Guards joined in around midnight. The 133rd Home Guard Regiment attacked east of Otočac, towards Vrhovine, attempting to encircle the ARSK 50th Infantry Brigade and elements of the ARSK 103rd Infantry Brigade in a pincer movement. Even though the regiment advanced, it failed to achieve its objective for the day. On the regiment&#x27;s right flank, the HV 128th Brigade advanced together with the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Home Guard Regiment and cut through the Vrhovine–Korenica road. The rest of the 9th Guards Brigade, the bulk of the HV 118th Home Guard Regiment and the 111th Infantry Brigade advanced east from Gospić and Lički Osik, coming up against very strong resistance from the ARSK 18th Infantry Brigade. As a result of these setbacks, the Gospić Corps ended the day short of the objectives it had been given.

====Sector North====
In the Ogulin area of the HV Karlovac Corps AOR, the 99th Brigade, reinforced by the 143rd Home Guard Regiment&#x27;s Saborsko Company, moved towards Plaški at 5 a.m., but the force was stopped and turned back in disarray by 6 p.m. The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced from Josipdol towards Plaški, encountering minefields and strong ARSK resistance. Its elements connected with the 14th Home Guard Regiment, advancing through Barilović towards Slunj. Near the city of Karlovac, the 137th Home Guard Regiment deployed four reconnaissance groups around midnight of 3–4 August, followed by artillery preparation and crossing of the Korana River at 5 a.m. The advance was fiercely resisted by the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade, but the bridgehead was stable by the end of the day. The 110th Home Guard Regiment, reinforced by a company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment, advanced east to the road leading south from Karlovac to Vojnić and Slunj, where it met heavy resistance and suffered more casualties to landmines, demoralizing the unit and preventing its further advance. In addition, the attached company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade failed to secure the regiment&#x27;s flanks. The 104th Brigade tried to cross the Kupa River at 5 a.m., but failed and fell back to its starting position by 8 a.m., at which time it was shifted to the bridgehead established by the 110th Home Guard Regiment. A company of the 99th Brigade was attached to the 143rd Home Guard Regiment for operations the next day, and a 250-strong battlegroup was removed from the brigade and subordinated to the Karlovac Corps directly.

In the Zagreb Corps area, the HV moved across the Kupa River at two points towards Glina—in and near Pokupsko, using the 20th Home Guard Regiment and the 153rd Brigade. Both crossings established bridgeheads, although the bulk of the units were forced to retreat as the ARSK counter-attacked—only a battalion of the 153rd Brigade and elements of the 20th Home Guard Regiment held their ground. The crossings prompted the ARSK General Staff to order the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the Special Units Corps to move from Slunj to the bridgeheads, as the HV advance threatened a vital road in Glina. The HV 2nd Guards Brigade and the 12th Home Guard Regiment were tasked with the quick capture of Petrinja from the ARSK 31st Motorized Brigade in a pincer movement. The original plan, involving thrusts south of Petrinja, was amended by Basarac to a direct assault on the city. On the right flank, the regiment was soon stopped by minefields and forced to retreat, while the bulk of the 2nd Guards Brigade advanced until it wavered following the loss of a company commander and five soldiers. The rest of the 2nd Guards Brigade—reinforced by the 2nd Battalion, elements of the 12th Home Guard Regiment, the 5th Antitank Artillery Battalion and the 31st Engineers Battalion—formed Tactical Group 2 (TG2) operating on the left flank of the attack. TG2 advanced from Mošćenica, a short distance from Petrinja, but was stopped after the 2nd Battalion&#x27;s commander and six soldiers were killed. The ARSK 31st Motorized Brigade also panicked but managed to stabilize its defences as it received reinforcements. The HV 57th Brigade advanced south of Petrinja, intent on reaching the Petrinja–Hrvatska Kostajnica road, but ran into a minefield where the brigade commander was killed, while the 101st Brigade to its rear suffered heavy artillery fire and casualties. In the Sunja area, the 17th Home Guard Regiment and a company of the 151st Brigade unsuccessfully attacked the ARSK 26th Infantry Brigade. Later that day, a separate attack by the rest of the 151st Brigade also failed. The HV 103rd Brigade advanced to the Sunja–Sisak railroad, but had to retreat under heavy fire. The Zagreb Corps failed to meet any objective of the first day. This was attributed to inadequate manpower and as a result the corps requested the mobilization of the 102nd Brigade and the 1st and 21st Home Guard Regiments. The 2nd Guards Brigade was reinforced by the 1st Battalion of the 149th Brigade previously held in reserve in Ivanić Grad.

In the Bjelovar Corps AOR, two battalions of the 125th Home Guard Regiment crossed the Sava River near Jasenovac, secured a bridgehead for trailing HV units and advanced towards Hrvatska Dubica. The two battalions were followed by an additional company of the same regiment, a battalion of the 52nd Home Guard Regiment, the 265th Reconnaissance Company and finally the 24th Home Guard Regiment battlegroup. A reconnaissance platoon of the 52nd Home Guard Regiment crossed the Sava River into the Republika Srpska, established a bridgehead for two infantry companies and subsequently demolished the Bosanska Dubica–Gradiška road before returning to Croatian soil. The Bjelovar Corps units reached the outskirts of Hrvatska Dubica before nightfall. That night, the town of Hrvatska Dubica was abandoned by the ARSK troops and the civilian population. They fled south across the Sava River into Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===5 August 1995===

====Sector South====

The HV did not advance towards Knin during the night of 4/5 August when the ARSK General Staff ordered a battalion of the 75th Motorized Brigade to stage themselves north of Knin. The ARSK North Dalmatian Corps became increasingly uncoordinated as the HV 4th Guards Brigade advanced south towards Knin, protecting the right flank of the 7th Guards Brigade. The latter met little resistance and entered the town at about 11 a.m. Lieutenant General Ivan Čermak was appointed commander of the newly established HV Knin Corps. Sinj OG completed its objectives, capturing Kozjak and Vrlika, and meeting little resistance as the ARSK 1st Light Brigade disintegrated, retreating to Knin and later to Lika. By 8 p.m., Šibenik OG units advanced to Poličnik (113th Brigade), Đevrske (15th Home Guard Regiment), and captured Drniš (142nd Home Guard Regiment), while the ARSK 75th Motorized Brigade retreated towards Srb and Bosanski Petrovac together with the 3rd Infantry and the 92nd Motorized Brigades, leaving the Zadar OG units with little opposition. The 7th Home Guard Regiment captured Benkovac, while the 112th Brigade entered Smilčić and elements of the 9th Guards Brigade reached Obrovac.

The 138th Home Guard Regiment and the 1st Guards Brigade advanced to Lička Jasenica, the latter pressing their attack further towards Saborsko, with the 2nd Battalion of the HV 119th Brigade reaching the area in the evening. The HV reinforced the 133rd Home Guard Regiment with a battalion of the 150th Brigade enabling the regiment to achieve its objectives of the previous day, partially encircling the ARSK force in Vrhovine. The 154th Home Guard Regiment was mobilized and deployed to the Ličko Lešće area. The 9th Guards Brigade (without its 2nd Battalion) advanced towards Udbina Air Base, where ARSK forces started to evacuate. The 111th Brigade and the 118th Home Guard Regiment also made small advances, linking up behind ARSK lines.

====Sector North====
The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced towards Plaški, capturing it that evening, while the 14th Home Guard Regiment captured Primišlje, northwest of Slunj. At 0:30 a.m., the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade and a company of the 19th Infantry Brigade counter-attacked at the Korana bridgehead, causing the bulk of the 137th Home Guard Regiment to panic and flee across the river. A single platoon of the regiment remained but the ARSK troops did not exploit the opportunity to destroy the bridgehead. In the morning, the regiment reoccupied the bridgehead, reinforced by a 350-strong battlegroup drawn from the 104th Brigade (including a tank platoon and multiple rocket launchers), and a company of the 148th Brigade from the Karlovac Corps operational reserve. The regiment and the battlegroup managed to extend the bridgehead towards the Karlovac–Slunj road. The 110th Home Guard Regiment attacked again south of Karlovac, but was repelled by prepared ARSK defences. That night, the Karlovac Corps decided to move elements of the 110th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade to the Korana bridgehead, while the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade retreated to the right bank of Korana in an area extending about north from Slunj.

The Zagreb Corps made little or no progress on day two of the battle. Part of the 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to drive towards Glina with the 20th Home Guards Regiment making a modest advance, while the 153rd Brigade abandoned its bridgehead. In the area of Petrinja, the HV advanced gradually only to be pushed back in some areas by an ARSK counter-attack. The results were reversed at significant cost by a renewed push by the 2nd Guards Brigade. The Zagreb Corps commander was replaced by Lieutenant General Petar Stipetić on orders from President Tuđman. The HV reassigned the 102nd Brigade to drive to Glina, and the 57th Brigade was reinforced with the 2nd Battalion of the 149th Brigade. The 145th Brigade was moved from Popovača to the Sunja area, where the 17th Home Guard Regiment and the 151st Brigade made minor advances into the ARSK-held area.

In the Bjelovar Corps AOR, Hrvatska Dubica was captured by the 52nd and the 24th Home Guard Regiments advancing from the east and the 125th Home Guard Regiment approaching from the north. The 125th Home Guard Regiment garrisoned the town, while the 52nd Home Guard Regiment moved northwest towards expected Zagreb Corps positions, but the Zagreb Corps&#x27; delays prevented any link-up. The 24th Home Guard Regiment advanced about towards Hrvatska Kostajnica when it was stopped by ARSK troops. In response, the Corps called in a battalion and a reconnaissance platoon of the 121st Home Guard Regiment from Nova Gradiška to aid the push to the town. The ARBiH 505th and 511th Mountain Brigades advanced north to Dvor and engaged the ARSK 33rd Infantry Brigade—the only reserve unit of the Banija Corps.

===6 August 1995===

On 6 August, the HV conducted mopping-up operations in the areas around Obrovac, Benkovac, Drniš and Vrlika, as President Tuđman visited Knin. After securing their objectives on or near Velebit, the special police was deployed on foot behind ARSK lines to hinder movement of ARSK troops there, capturing strategic intersections in the villages of Bruvno at 7 a.m. and Otrić at 11 a.m.

At midnight, elements of the ARBiH 501st and 502nd Mountain Brigades advanced west from Bihać against a skeleton force of the ARSK Lika Corps that had been left behind since the beginning of the battle. The 501st moved about into Croatian territory, to Ličko Petrovo Selo and Plitvice Lakes by 8 a.m. The 502nd captured an ARSK radar and communications facility on Plješivica Mountain, and proceeded towards Korenica where it was stopped by the ARSK units. The HV 1st Guards Brigade reached Rakovica and linked up with the Bosnia-Herzegovina 5th Corps in the area of Drežnik Grad by 11 a.m. It was supported by the 119th Brigade and a battalion of the 154th Home Guard Regiment deployed in the Tržačka Raštela and Ličko Petrovo Selo areas. In the afternoon, a link-up ceremony was held for the media in Tržačka Raštela. The 138th Home Guard Regiment completely encircled Vrhovine, which was captured by the end of the day by the 8th and the 133rd Home Guard Regiments, reinforced with a battalion of the 150th Brigade. The HV 128th Brigade entered Korenica while the 9th Guards Brigade continued towards Udbina.

The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced to Broćanac where it connected with the 1st Guards Brigade. From there the regiment continued towards Slunj, accompanied by elements of the 1st Guards Brigade and the 14th Home Guard Regiment, capturing the town at 3 p.m. The advance of the 14th Home Guard Regiment was supported by the 148th Brigade guarding its flanks. The ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade retreated from Slunj, together with the civilian population, moving north towards Topusko. An attack by the 137th Home Guard Regiment, and the elements of various units reinforcing it, extended the bridgehead and connected it with the 14th Home Guard Regiment in Veljun, north of Slunj. The rest of the 149th Brigade (without the 1st Battalion) was reassigned from the Zagreb Corps to the Karlovac Corps to reinforce the 137th Home Guard Regiment. At 11 a.m., an agreement was reached between the ARSK and civilian authorities in Glina and Vrginmost, securing the evacuation of civilians from the area. The ARBiH 502nd Mountain Brigade also moved north, flanking the APWB capital of Velika Kladuša from the west, and capturing the town by the end of the day.

The TG2 advanced to Petrinja at about 7 a.m. after a heavy artillery preparation. The 12th Home Guard Regiment entered the city from the west and was subsequently assigned to garrison Petrinja and its surrounding area. After the loss of Petrinja to the HV, the bulk of the ARSK Banija Corps started to retreat towards Dvor. The HV 57th Brigade advanced against light resistance and took control of the Petrinja–Hrvatska Kostajnica road. During the night of 6/7 August, the 20th Home Guard Regiment, supported by Croatian police and elements of the 153rd Brigade, captured Glina despite strong resistance. The 153rd Brigade then took positions that allowed the advance to continue towards the village of Maja in coordination with the 2nd Guards Brigade, which drove south from Petrinja towards Zrinska gora conducting mop-up operations. The 140th Home Guard Regiment flanked the 2nd Guards Brigade on the northern slope of Zrinska Gora, while the 57th Brigade captured Umetić. The 103rd and the 151st Brigades, and the 17th Home Guard Regiment, advanced towards Hrvatska Kostajnica, with the addition of a battalion of the HV 145th Brigade which would arrive that afternoon. Around noon, the 151st Brigade connected with the Bjelovar Corps units on the Sunja–Hrvatska Dubica road. They were assigned to secure roads in the area afterwards.

By capturing Glina, the HV trapped the bulk of the ARSK Kordun Corps and about 35,000 evacuating civilians in the area of Topusko, prompting its commander to request UNCRO protection. The 1st Guards Brigade, approaching Topusko from Vojnić, received orders to engage the ARSK Kordun Corps, but the orders were cancelled at midnight by the chief of the HV General Staff. Instead, the Zagreb Corps was instructed to prepare a brigade-strength unit to escort unarmed persons and ARSK officers and non-commissioned officers with side arms to Dvor and allow them to cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina. Based on information obtained from UN troops, it was believed that the ARSK forces in Banovina were about to surrender.

A battalion of the 121st Home Guard Regiment entered Hrvatska Kostajnica, while the 24th Home Guard Regiment battlegroup secured the national border behind them. The 52nd Home Guard Regiment connected with the Zagreb Corps and then turned south to the town, reaching it that evening. The capture of Hrvatska Kostajnica marked the fulfilment of all of the Bjelovar Corps&#x27; objectives.

===7 August 1995===
The 1st Croatian Guards Brigade (&quot;1. hrvatski gardijski zdrug&quot; - HGZ) arrived in the Knin area to connect with elements of the 4th, 7th and 9th Guards Brigades, tasked with a northward advance the next day. The Split Corps command moved to Knin as well. The Croatian special police proceeded to Gornji Lapac and Donji Lapac arriving by 2 p.m. and completing the boundary between the Gospić and Split Corps AORs. The Croatian special police also made contact with the 4th Guards Brigade in Otrić and the Gospić Corps units in Udbina by 3 p.m. By 7 p.m., a battalion of the special police reached the border near Kulen Vakuf, securing the area.

In the morning, the 9th Guards Brigade (without its 2nd Battalion) captured Udbina, where it connected with the 154th Home Guard Regiment, approaching from the opposite side of the Krbava Polje ( or karst field). By the end of the day, Operation Storm objectives assigned to the Gospić Corps were completed.

A forward command post of the HV General Staff was moved from Ogulin to Slunj, and it assumed direct command of the 1st Guards Brigade, the 14th Home Guard Regiment and the 99th Brigade. The 14th Home Guard Regiment secured the Slunj area and deployed to the left bank of Korana to connect with the advancing Karlovac special police. Elements of the regiment and the 99th Brigade secured the national border in the area. The 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards Kordun, as the Karlovac Corps reoriented its main axis of attack. The 110th Home Guard Regiment and elements of the 104th Brigade reached a largely deserted Vojnić in early afternoon, followed by the 1st Guards Brigade, the 143rd Home Guard Brigade and the 137th Home Guard Regiment. Other HV units joined them by evening.

The 2nd Guards Brigade advanced from Maja towards Dvor, but was stopped approximately short by ARSK units protecting the withdrawal of the ARSK and civilians towards the town. Elements of the brigade performed mopping-up operations in the area. The ARSK 33rd Infantry Brigade held the road bridge in Dvor that connected the ARSK and the Republika Srpska across the Una River. The brigade was overwhelmed by the ARBiH 5th Corps, and it retreated south of Una, as the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade and the civilians from Kordun were reaching Dvor. Elements of the 17th Home Guard Regiment and the HV 145th and 151st Brigades reached Dvor via Hrvatska Kostajnica and came into contact with the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade and elements of the ARSK 24th Infantry and 2nd Armoured Brigades, who had retreated from Glina. As the expected surrender of the ARSK Kordun Corps did not materialize, the HV was ordered to reengage. Despite major pockets of resistance, Croatia&#x27;s defence minister, Gojko Šušak, declared major operations over at 6 p.m., 84 hours after the battle had started.

===8–14 August 1995===
On 8 August, the 4th and the 7th Guards Brigades, the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade and the 1st HGZ advanced north to Lička Kaldrma and the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina, eliminating the last major pocket of ARSK resistance in Donji Lapac and the Srb area by 8 p.m. and achieving all of Split Corps&#x27; objectives for Operation Storm. After the capture of Vojnić, the bulk of the Karlovac Corps units were tasked with mopping up operations in their AOR. Elements of the 2nd Guards Brigade reached the Croatian border southwest of Dvor, where fighting for full control of the town was in progress, and connected with the ARBiH 5th Corps.

As Tuđman ordered the cessation of military operations that afternoon, the ARSK Kordun Corps accepted surrender. Negotiations of the terms of surrender were held the same day at 1:20 p.m. at the Ukrainian UNCRO troops command post in Glina, and the surrender document was signed at 2 p.m. in Topusko. Croatia was represented by Lieutenant General Stipetić, while the RSK was represented by Bulat, commander of the ARSK Kordun Corps, and Interior Minister Tošo Pajić. The terms of surrender specified the handover of weapons, except officers&#x27; side arms, on the following day, and the evacuation of persons from Topusko via Glina, Sisak, and the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway to Serbia, protected by the Croatian military and civilian police.

On 9 August, the special police surrendered their positions to the HV, after covering more than on foot in four days. The 1st Guards Brigade, followed by other HV units, entered Vrginmost. The 110th and the 143rd Home Guard Regiments conducted mopping up operations around Vrginmost and Lasinja. The 137th Home Guard Regiment conducted mopping up operations in the Vojnić area and the 14th Home Guard Regiment did the same in the Slunj, Cetingrad, and Rakovica areas. The HV secured Dvor late in the evening, shortly after the civilians finished evacuating. Numerous HV Home Guard units were later tasked with further mopping up operations.

On 10 August, the HV 57th Brigade reached the Croatian border south of Gvozdansko, while elements of the 2nd Guards Brigade reached Dvor and the 12th Home Guard Regiment captured Matijevići, just to the south of Dvor, on the Croatian border. The Zagreb Corps reported that the entire national border in its AOR was secured and all its Operation Storm objectives had been achieved. Mopping up operations in Banovina lasted until 14 August, and special police units joined the operations on the Zrinska Gora and Petrova Gora mountains.

==Air force operations==

On 4 August 1995, the CAF had at its disposal 17 MiG-21s, five attack and nine transport helicopters, three transport airplanes and two reconnaissance aircraft. On that first day of the operation, thirteen MiG-21s were used to destroy or disable six targets in the Gospić and Zagreb Corps AORs, at the cost of one severely and three slightly damaged jets. The same day, three Mi-8s were used for medical evacuation. US Navy EA-6Bs and F/A-18s on patrol as part of Operation Deny Flight fired on ARSK surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites at Udbina and Knin as SAM radars locked onto the jets. A few sources claim that they were deployed as a deterrent as the UN troops came under HV fire, and a subsequent UN Security Council report only notes that the deployment was a result of the deterioration of the military situation and resulting low security of the peacekeepers in the area. Also on 4 August, the RSK 105th Aviation Brigade based at Udbina, deployed helicopters against the Croatian special police on Velebit Mountain and against targets in the Gospić area virtually to no effect.

On 5 August, the RSK air force began evacuating to Zalužani Airfield near Banja Luka, completing the move that day. At the same time the CAF deployed 11 MiG-21s to strike a communications facility and a storage site, as well as five other military positions throughout the RSK. That day, the CAF also deployed a Mi-24 to attack ARSK armour units near Sisak and five Mi-8s to transport casualties, and move troops and cargo. Five CAF MiG-21s sustained light damage in the process. The next day, jets struck an ARSK command post, a bridge and at least four other targets near Karlovac and Glina. A Mi-24 was deployed to the Slunj area to attack ARSK tanks, while three Mi-8s transported wounded personnel and supplies. An additional pair of MiG-21s was deployed to patrol the airspace over Ivanić Grad and intercept two Bosnian Serb fighter jets, but they failed to do so due to fog in the area and their low level of flight. The VRS aircraft subsequently managed to strike the Petrokemija chemical plant in Kutina.

On 7 August, two VRS air force jets attacked a village in the Nova Gradiška area, just north of the Sava River—the international border in the area. The CAF bombed an ARSK command post, a storage facility and several tanks near Bosanski Petrovac. CAF jets also struck a column of Serb refugees near Bosanski Petrovac, killing nine people, including four children, while the following day, another refugee convoy near the village of Svodna was hit, bringing the civilian casualties to twelve. Croatia has denied that it targeted civilians. On 8 August, the CAF performed its last combat sorties in the operation, striking tanks and armoured vehicles between Bosanski Novi and Prijedor, and two of its MiG-21s were damaged. The same day, UN military observers deployed at Croatian airfields claimed that the CAF attacked military targets and civilians in the Dvor area, where refugee columns were mixed with ARSK transporting heavy weapons and large quantities of ammunition. Overall, the CAF performed 67 close air support, three attack helicopter, seven reconnaissance, four combat air patrol and 111 transport helicopter sorties during Operation Storm.

==Other coordinated operations==
In order to protect areas of Croatia away from Sectors North and South, the HV conducted defensive operations while the HVO started a limited offensive north of Glamoč and Kupres to pin down part of the VRS forces, exploit the situation and gain positions for further advance. On 5 August, the HVO 2nd and 3rd Guards Brigades attacked VRS positions north of Tomislavgrad, achieving small advances to secure more favourable positions for future attacks towards Šipovo and Jajce, while tying down part of the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps. As a consequence of the overall battlefield situation, the VRS was limited to a few counter-attacks around Bihać and Grahovo as it was short of reserves. The most significant counter-attack was launched by the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps on the night of 11/12 August. It broke through the 141st Brigade, consisting of the HV&#x27;s reserve infantry, reaching the outskirts of Bosansko Grahovo, only to be beaten back by the HV, using one battalion drawn from the 4th Guards and the 7th Guards Brigade each, supported by the 6th and the 126th Home Guard Regiments.

===Operation Phoenix===
In eastern Slavonia, the HV Osijek Corps was tasked with preventing ARSK or Yugoslav Army forces from advancing west in the region, and counter-attacking into the ARSK-held area around Vukovar. The Osijek Corps mission was codenamed Operation Phoenix (). The Corps commanded the 3rd Guards and 5th Guards Brigades, as well as six other HV brigades and seven Home Guard regiments. Additional reinforcements were provided in a form of specialized corps-level units otherwise directly subordinated to the HV General Staff, including a part of the Mi-24 gunship squadron. Even though artillery rounds and small arms fire were traded between the HV and the ARSK 11th Slavonia-Baranja Corps in the region, no major attack occurred. The most significant coordinated ARSK effort occurred on 5 August, when the exchange was compounded by three RSK air raids and an infantry and tank assault targeting Nuštar, northeast of Vinkovci. Operation Storm led the Yugoslav Army to mobilize and deploy considerable artillery, tanks and infantry to the border area near eastern Slavonia, but it took no part in the battle.

===Operation Maestral===

In the south of Croatia, the HV deployed to protect the Dubrovnik area against the VRS Herzegovina Corps and the Yugoslav Army situated in and around Trebinje and the Bay of Kotor. The plan, codenamed Operation Maestral, entailed deployment of the 114th, 115th and 163rd Brigades, the 116th and 156th Home Guard Regiments, the 1st Home Guard Battalion (Dubrovnik), the 16th Artillery Battalion, the 39th Engineers Battalion and a mobile coastal artillery battery. The area was reinforced on 8 August with the 144th Brigade as the unit completed its objectives in Operation Storm and moved to Dubrovnik. The CAF committed two MiG-21s and two Mi-24s based in Split to Operation Maestral. The Croatian Navy supported the operation deploying the Korčula, Brač and Hvar Marine Detachments, as well as missile boats, minesweepers, anti-submarine warfare ships and coastal artillery. In the period, the VRS attacked the Dubrovnik area intermittently using artillery only.

==Assessment of the battle==

Operation Storm became the largest European land battle since the Second World War, encompassing a frontline. It was a decisive victory for Croatia, restoring its control over of territory, representing 18.4% of the country. Losses sustained by the HV and the special police are most often cited as 174 killed and 1,430 wounded, but a government report prepared weeks after the battle specified 211 killed or missing, 1,100 wounded and three captured soldiers. By 21 August, Croatian authorities recovered and buried 560 ARSK servicemen killed in the battle. The HV captured 4,000 prisoners of war, 54 armoured and 497 other vehicles, six aircraft, hundreds of artillery pieces and over 4,000 infantry weapons. Four UN peacekeepers were killed—three as a result of HV actions and one as a result of ARSK activities—and 16 injured. The HV destroyed 98 UN observation posts.

The HV&#x27;s success was a result of a series of improvements to the HV itself and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the HV and the ARBiH. The attack was not immediately successful everywhere, but the seizing of key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability. The HV&#x27;s capture of Bosansko Grahovo just before Operation Storm and the special police&#x27;s advance to Gračac made Knin nearly impossible to defend. In Lika, two Guards brigades rapidly cut the ARSK-held area lacking tactical depth or mobile reserve forces, isolating pockets of resistance and placing the 1st Guards Brigade in a position that allowed it to move north into the Karlovac Corps AOR, pushing ARSK forces towards Banovina. The defeat of the ARSK at Glina and Petrinja, after heavy fighting, also defeated the ARSK Banija Corps, as its reserve became immobilized by the ARBiH. The ARSK force was capable of containing or substantially holding assaults by regular HV brigades and the Home Guard, but attacks by the Guards brigades and the special police proved to be decisive. Colonel Andrew Leslie, commanding the UNCRO in the Knin area, assessed Operation Storm as a textbook operation that would have &quot;scored an A-plus&quot; by NATO standards.

Even if the ARBiH had not provided aid, the HV would almost certainly have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK&#x27;s key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK&#x27;s static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military was unable to check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, holding back the HV&#x27;s 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj for less than a single day. The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did not intervene militarily as Milošević did not order it to do so. Even if he had wished to intervene, the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.

==Refugee crisis==

The evacuation and following mass-exodus of the Serbs from the RSK led to a significant humanitarian crisis. In August 1995, the UN estimated that only 3,500 Serbs remained in Kordun and Banovina (former Sector North) and 2,000 remained in Lika and Northern Dalmatia (former Sector South), while more than 150,000 had fled to Yugoslavia, and between 10,000 and 15,000 had arrived in the Banja Luka area. The number of Serb refugees was reported to be as many as 200,000 by the international media and international organizations. Also, 21,000 Bosniak refugees from the former APWB fled to Croatia.

While approximately 35,000 Serb refugees, trapped with the surrendered ARSK Kordun Corps, were evacuated to Yugoslavia via Sisak and the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, the bulk of the refugees followed a route through the Republika Srpska, arriving there via Dvor in Banovina or via Srb in Lika—two corridors to Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina left as the HV advanced. The two points of retreat were created as a consequence of the delay of a northward advance of the HV Split Corps after the capture of Knin, and the decision not to use the entire HV 2nd Guards Brigade to spearhead the southward advance from Petrinja. The retreating ARSK, transporting large quantities of weaponry, ammunition, artillery and tanks, often intermingled with evacuating or fleeing civilians, had few roads to use. The escaping columns were reportedly intermittently attacked by CAF jets, and the HV, trading fire with the ARSK located close to the civilian columns. The refugees were also targeted by ARBiH troops, as well as by VRS jets, and sometimes were run over by the ARSK Special Units Corps&#x27; retreating tanks. On 9 August, a refugee convoy evacuating from the former Sector North under the terms of the ARSK Kordun Corps&#x27; surrender agreement was attacked by Croatian civilians in Sisak. The attack caused one civilian death, many injuries and damage to a large number of vehicles. Croatian police intervened in the incident after UN civilian police monitors pressured them to do so. The next day, US ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith joined the column to protect them, and the Croatian police presence along the planned route increased. The refugees moving through the Republika Srpska were extorted at checkpoints and forced to pay extra for fuel and other services by local strongmen.
Aiming to reduce evidence of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees in various parts of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of Vojvodina were evicted from their homes by the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out of their homes.

===Return of the refugees===
At the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, in 1991–1992, a non-Serb population of more than 220,000 was forcibly removed from Serb-held territories in Croatia, as the RSK was established. In the wake of Operation Storm, a part of those refugees, as well as Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, settled in a substantial number of housing units in the area formerly held by the ARSK, presenting an obstacle to the return of Serb refugees. In September 2010, out of 300,000–350,000 Serbs who fled from Croatia during the entire war, 132,707 were registered as having returned, but only 60–65% of those were believed to reside permanently in the country. However, only 20,000–25,000 more were interested in returning to Croatia. In 2010, approximately 60,000 Serb refugees from Croatia remained in Serbia.

The ICTY stated that Croatia adopting discriminatory measures after the departures of Serb civilians from the Krajina does not demonstrate that these departures were forced. Human Rights Watch reported in 1999 that Serbs did not enjoy their civil rights as Croatian citizens, as a result of discriminatory laws and practices, and that they were frequently unable to return to and live freely in Croatia. The return of refugees has been hampered by several obstacles. These include property ownership and accommodation, as Croat refugees settled in vacated homes, and Croatian war-time legislation that stripped the refugees once living in government-owned housing of their tenancy rights. The legislation was abolished following the war, and alternative accommodation is offered to returnees. 6,538 housing units were allocated by November 2010. Another obstacle is the difficulty for refugees to obtain residency status or Croatian citizenship. Applicable legislation has been relaxed since, and by November 2010, Croatia allowed the validation of identity documents issued by the RSK. Even though Croatia declared a general amnesty, refugees fear legal prosecution, as the amnesty does not pertain to war crimes.

In 2015 and 2017 report, Amnesty International expressed concern about persisting obstacles for Serbs to regain their property. They reported that Croatian Serbs continued to face discrimination in public sector employment and the restitution of tenancy rights to social housing vacated during the war. They also pointed to hate speech, &quot;evoking fascist ideology&quot; and the right to use minority languages and script continued to be politicized and unimplemented in some towns.

==War crimes==
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), set up in 1993 based on the UN Security Council Resolution 827, indicted Gotovina, Čermak and Markač for war crimes, specifically for their roles in Operation Storm, citing their participation in a joint criminal enterprise aimed at the permanent removal of Serbs from the ARSK-held part of Croatia. The ICTY charges specified that other participants in the joint criminal enterprise were Tuđman, Šušak, and Bobetko and Červenko, however all except Bobetko were dead before the first relevant ICTY indictment was issued in 2001. Bobetko was indicted by the ICTY, but died a year later, before he could be extradited for trial at the ICTY. The trial of Gotovina &quot;et al&quot; began in 2008, leading to the convictions of Gotovina and Markač and the acquittal of Čermak three years later. Gotovina and Markač were acquitted on appeal in November 2012. The ICTY concluded that Operation Storm was not aimed at ethnic persecution, as civilians had not been deliberately targeted. The Appeals Chamber stated that Croatian Army and Special Police committed crimes after the artillery assault, but the state and military leadership had no role in planning and creation of crimes. The ICTY concluded that Croatia did not have the specific intent of displacing the country&#x27;s Serb minority. Furthermore, they did not find that Gotovina and Markač played a role in adopting discriminatory efforts that prevent the return of Serb civilians. Two judges in the panel of five dissented from this verdict. The case raised significant issues for law of war and it has been described as a precedent.

Views on whether Operation Storm itself as a whole was a war crime remain mixed. EU envoy Bildt, one of the few critics of the operation, accused Croatia of the most efficient ethnic cleansing carried out in the Yugoslav Wars. Croatia denied this claiming it had &quot;urged Serbs to stay&quot;, however soldiers also engaged in shelling of Serb inhabited areas, killing of civilians and allowed Croats to engage in the burning and plundering of Serb homes, according to a UN report. His view is supported by a number of Western analysts, such as Professor Marie-Janine Calic, Miloševic biographer Adam LeBor, and Professor Paul Mojzes, while historians Gerard Toal and Carl T. Dahlman distinguish the Operation from &quot;the practices of ethnic cleansing&quot; that occurred during the offensive. Historian Marko Attila Hoare disagrees that the operation was an act of ethnic cleansing, and points out that the Krajina Serb leadership evacuated the civilian population as a response to the Croatian offensive; whatever their intentions, the Croatians never had the chance to organise their removal. The claims of ethnic cleansing were rejected by Galbraith. Red Cross officials, UN observers and Western diplomats condemned Galbraith&#x27;s denial of the ethnic cleansing, with one ambassador calling his remarks &quot;breathtaking.&quot; In the Gotovina Defence Final Trial Brief, Gotovina&#x27;s lawyers Luka Misetic, Greg Kehoe and Payam Akhavan rejected the accusation of mass expulsion of Serbian population. They referred to the ICTY testimony of RSK Commander Mile Mrkšić, who stated that on 4 August 1995, sometime after 16:00 hrs, it was Milan Martić and his staff who in fact made a decision to evacuate the Serb population from Krajina to Srb, a village near the Bosnian border. Mojzes also notes that Serbs were ordered by their command to leave, at which a mass exodus took place from the entire Krajina region on &quot;short notice&quot;. ICTY findings also stated evidence indicating that General Gotovina &quot;adopted numerous measures&quot; to prevent and curb crimes and general disorder following the artillery attacks, including crimes against Serb civilians. 

In February 2015, at the conclusion of the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed a Serbian lawsuit which alleged that Operation Storm constituted genocide, ruling that Croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country&#x27;s Serb minority, though it reaffirmed that serious crimes against Serb civilians had taken place. The court also found that the HV left accessible escape routes for civilians. They also found that, at most, the leaders of Croatia envisaged that the military offensive would have the effect of causing the flight of the great majority of the Serb population, that they were satisfied with that consequence and they wished to encourage the departure of the Serb civilians, but do not establish the existence of the specific intent which characterizes genocide. According to the judgement, Serb civilians fleeing their homes, as well as those remaining in UN protected areas, were subject to various forms of harassment by both the HV and Croatian civilians. On 8 August, a refugee column was shelled.
The number of civilian casualties in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney&#x27;s Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed—156 in 24 instances of war crimes and another 47 as victims of murder—during the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The Croatian Helsinki Committee disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed after Operation Storm, mainly old people who remained, while an additional 837 Serb civilians are listed as missing. When submitted as evidence, their report was rejected by the ICTY due to unsourced statements and double entries contained within. Other sources indicate 181 more victims were killed by Croatian forces and buried in a mass grave in Mrkonjić Grad, following a continuation of the Operation Storm offensive into Bosnia. Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing. ICTY prosecutors set the number of civilian deaths at 324. Croatian government officials estimate that 42 Croatian civilians were killed during the operation.

It is difficult to determine the exact number of properties destroyed during and after Operation Storm, since a large number of houses had already sustained damage since the beginning of the war. Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimates that more than 5,000 homes were destroyed during and after the battle. Out of the 122 Serbian Orthodox churches in the area, one was destroyed and 17 were damaged, but most of the damage to the churches occurred prior to the Serb retreat. HRW also reported that the vast majority of the abuses during Operation Storm were committed by Croatian forces. These abuses, which continued on a large scale for months afterward, included summary executions of elderly and infirm Serbs who remained behind and the wholesale burning and destruction of Serb villages and property. In the months following Operation Storm, at least 150 Serb civilians were summarily executed and another 110 persons forcibly disappeared. One such example is the Varivode massacre, in which nine Serb civilians were killed. Other recorded crimes against Serb civilians either during or in the aftermath of Operation Storm occurred in Komić, Kijani, Golubić, Uzdolje, Grubori, and Gošić.

, the Croatian authorities have received 6,390 reports of crimes committed in the area during or after Operation Storm, and have convicted 2,380 persons of committing looting, arson, murders, war crimes and other illegal acts. As of the same date, 24 more trials of war crimes related to Operation Storm were in progress. In 2012, Serbian authorities were investigating five cases of war crimes committed during Operation Storm. On the 25th anniversary of the Operation, the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network analyzed documents from the ICTY trial and found that very few of the perpetrators of killings of Serb civilians have been brought to justice while none of the commanders of the units responsible have been prosecuted.

In February 2025, The Higher Court in Belgrade scheduled the trial of four Croatian Air Force officers, charging them with war crimes over the Bosanski Petrovac and Svodna refugee column bombing case. As they are unavailable to Serbian authorities, the trial will proceed in absentia. A preparatory hearing was held in November 2022, but the court sought Croatia’s stance on the matter. Croatian authorities declined to cooperate, refusing to deliver the trial summons. The Croatian government stated that they would use all mechanisms to protect their pilots, and claimed that the trial is politically motivated. Croatia disputes the Serbian judiciary&#x27;s jurisdiction for alleged acts committed on the territory outside of Serbia by people who are not Serbian citizens and argues that the ICTY has already investigated the events.

==Aftermath==

The defeat of the RSK led the Bosnian Serbs to realise that a settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be negotiated as soon as possible, and reversed the tide of the war against the Serbs, giving US diplomacy a strong boost. The success of Operation Storm also represented a strategic victory in the Bosnian War as it lifted the siege of Bihać, and allowed the Croatian and Bosnian leadership to plan a full-scale military intervention in the VRS-held Banja Luka area—one aimed at creating a new balance of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a buffer zone along the Croatian border, and contributing to the resolution of the war. The intervention materialized as Operation Mistral 2 in September 1995. Combined with a NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it led to the start of peace talks that would result in the Dayton Agreement a few months later. The development also led to the restoration of the remaining Serb-held areas in eastern Slavonia and Baranja to Croatian control through the Erdut Agreement, ending the Croatian War of Independence in November.

The ease with which the HV achieved victory surprised many observers as Western intelligence services predicted a Croatian defeat. International reactions to Operation Storm quickly evolved from emotive arguments, supportive of either side in the battle, to those calmly assessing the situation on the ground. UN officials and most international media criticised Croatia. Carl Bildt, an EU negotiator working for the former Yugoslavia, publicly condemned Croatia, while UN Special Representative Stoltenberg urged the UN Secretary General Personal Representative Yasushi Akashi to request NATO strikes against the HV. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel expressed regret but added that &quot;... the years of Serb aggression ... have sorely tried Croatia&#x27;s patience&quot;. The US response was mixed. While Secretary of Defense William Perry reflected favourably on the military development, while Galbraith declared his disapproval. On 10 August, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1009 demanding that Croatia halt military operations, condemning the targeting of UN peacekeepers, and calling for the resumption of talks—but not calling for a HV withdrawal. By 18 August, US diplomats on Robert Frasure&#x27;s team tasked to mediate in the Bosnian War believed Operation Storm lent their diplomatic mission a chance to succeed, reflecting the opinion of US President Bill Clinton that the Serbs would not negotiate seriously unless they sustained major military defeats.
In Serbia, Milošević condemned the Croatian attack, but the Milošević-influenced press also denounced the leadership of the RSK as being incompetent, while the most extreme politicians, including Vojislav Šešelj, demanded retaliation against Croatia. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić begged for the Yugoslav Army to help while accusing Milošević of treason.

In Croatia, HV units returning to their bases were given heroes&#x27; welcomes in numerous cities, and a commemorative medal was created to be issued to HV troops who took part in the operation. On 26 August, Croatia organised the Freedom Train—a railroad tour taking Tuđman and the bulk of Croatia&#x27;s government officials, public personalities, journalists and the diplomatic corps in Croatia from Zagreb to Karlovac, Gospić, Knin and Split. Tuđman gave a speech at each of the stops. In Knin, he declared: &quot;[The Serbs] didn&#x27;t even have time to collect their dirty [money] and their dirty underwear. On this day, we can say that Croatia stopped bearing its historical cross. This is not just the liberation of land, but the creation of a foundation for a free and independent Croatia for centuries to come.&quot; During the final rally in Split, which drew a crowd of 300,000, Tuđman vowed to liberate Vukovar as well.

==Commemoration==
Croats and Serbs hold opposing views of the operation. In Croatia, 5 August—the day that the HV captured Knin—was chosen as Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day and the Day of Croatian Defenders, the Croatian public holiday when Operation Storm is officially celebrated. In Serbia and the Republika Srpska, the day is marked by mourning for the Serbs killed and those who fled during or after the operation.

In 2015, on the 20th anniversary of the operation, Croatia national TV (HRT) produced &quot;Godina Oluje,&quot; a four episode documentary about the preparation and execution of Operation Storm. The series was directed by Croatian American filmmaker Jack Baric.

On the 23rd anniversary of the operation, the celebration in Knin was attended by brigadier Ivan Mašulović, military attaché of Montenegro. It was the first time that Montenegro sent an envoy to Knin. The move was heavily criticized by Montenegrin pro-Serbian politicians and Serbian media. Montenegrin right-wing party New Serb Democracy (NSD) called Mašulović a traitor, as well as those &quot;who sent him to a celebration of a crime against the Serbian people.&quot; Some went so far as to compare him to Montenegrin fascist collaborator Sekula Drljević. Montenegrin Ministry of Defence defended their decision to send an envoy stating that &quot;Montenegro would not fight anyone else&#x27;s battles. Montenegro has the stance of building good neighbourly relations with all countries in the region,&quot; including &quot;close and friendly&quot; Serbia and &quot;close and friendly&quot; NATO ally Croatia.

On the 25th anniversary of the operation, the celebration in Knin was attended for the first time ever by an ethnic Serb political representative, Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Boris Milošević. His move was applauded across Croatia, with Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković stating that it will &quot;send a new message for Croatian society, relations between Croatians and Serb minority ... between Croatia and Serbia.&quot; Other notable politicians who praised it include member of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) Peđa Grbin, president of the Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS) Milorad Pupovac, leader of the Democratic Alliance of Croats in Vojvodina (DSHV) Tomislav Žigmanov, Mayor of Knin Marko Jelić and retired general Pavao Miljavac. Milošević&#x27;s move was met with criticism from the far-right party Homeland Movement (DP) and members of Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) paramilitary. Leader of the Homeland Movement Miroslav Škoro refused to participate in the official ceremony, despite being a Deputy Speaker of the Parliament, and stated that &quot;there is no reason for reconciliation of any kind.&quot; The move was also received negatively by the Governments of Serbia and Republika Srpska. At the celebration, Prime Minister Plenković, President Zoran Milanović and General Gotovina sent messages of peace and reconciliation and sympathy for Serbian civilian victims as well. Serbia held a commemoration on the Rača Bridge over the Sava River, while a tableau was staged on the bridge with actors dressed as refugees sitting in Yugoslav-era cars and tractors.

<text>In Euclidean geometry, a regular polygon is a polygon that is direct equiangular (all angles are equal in measure) and equilateral (all sides have the same length). Regular polygons may be either &quot;convex&quot; or &quot;star&quot;. In the limit, a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides approximates a circle, if the perimeter or area is fixed, or a regular apeirogon (effectively a straight line), if the edge length is fixed.

==General properties==

These properties apply to all regular polygons, whether convex or star:

*A regular &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon has rotational symmetry of order &quot;n&quot;.

*All vertices of a regular polygon lie on a common circle (the circumscribed circle); i.e., they are concyclic points. That is, a regular polygon is a cyclic polygon.

*Together with the property of equal-length sides, this implies that every regular polygon also has an inscribed circle or incircle that is tangent to every side at the midpoint. Thus a regular polygon is a tangential polygon.

*A regular &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if the odd prime factors of &quot;n&quot; are distinct Fermat primes. 

*A regular &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon can be constructed with origami if and only if formula_1 for some formula_2, where each distinct formula_3 is a Pierpont prime.

===Symmetry===
The symmetry group of an &quot;n&quot;-sided regular polygon is the dihedral group D&quot;n&quot; (of order 2&quot;n&quot;): D2, D3, D4, ... It consists of the rotations in C&quot;n&quot;, together with reflection symmetry in &quot;n&quot; axes that pass through the center. If &quot;n&quot; is even then half of these axes pass through two opposite vertices, and the other half through the midpoint of opposite sides. If &quot;n&quot; is odd then all axes pass through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.

==Regular convex polygons==
All regular simple polygons (a simple polygon is one that does not intersect itself anywhere) are convex. Those having the same number of sides are also similar.

An &quot;n&quot;-sided convex regular polygon is denoted by its Schläfli symbol formula_4. For formula_5, we have two degenerate cases:
; Monogon {1}: Degenerate in ordinary space. (Most authorities do not regard the monogon as a true polygon, partly because of this, and also because the formulae below do not work, and its structure is not that of any abstract polygon.)
; Digon {2}; a &quot;double line segment&quot;: Degenerate in ordinary space. (Some authorities do not regard the digon as a true polygon because of this.)

In certain contexts all the polygons considered will be regular. In such circumstances it is customary to drop the prefix regular. For instance, all the faces of uniform polyhedra must be regular and the faces will be described simply as triangle, square, pentagon, etc.
===Angles===
For a regular convex &quot;n&quot;-gon, each interior angle has a measure of:
: formula_6 degrees;
: formula_7 radians; or
: formula_8 full turns,

and each exterior angle (i.e., supplementary to the interior angle) has a measure of formula_9 degrees, with the sum of the exterior angles equal to 360 degrees or 2π radians or one full turn.

As &quot;n&quot; approaches infinity, the internal angle approaches 180 degrees. For a regular polygon with 10,000 sides (a myriagon) the internal angle is 179.964°. As the number of sides increases, the internal angle can come very close to 180°, and the shape of the polygon approaches that of a circle. However the polygon can never become a circle. The value of the internal angle can never become exactly equal to 180°, as the circumference would effectively become a straight line (see apeirogon). For this reason, a circle is not a polygon with an infinite number of sides.

===Diagonals===
For formula_10, the number of diagonals is formula_11; i.e., 0, 2, 5, 9, ..., for a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, ... . The diagonals divide the polygon into 1, 4, 11, 24, ... pieces.

For a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon inscribed in a circle of radius formula_12, the product of the distances from a given vertex to all other vertices (including adjacent vertices and vertices connected by a diagonal) equals &quot;n&quot;.

===Points in the plane===

For a regular simple &quot;n&quot;-gon with circumradius &quot;R&quot; and distances &quot;di&quot; from an arbitrary point in the plane to the vertices, we have

:formula_13

For higher powers of distances formula_14 from an arbitrary point in the plane to the vertices of a regular formula_15-gon, if

:formula_16,

then

:formula_17,

and

:formula_18,

where formula_19 is a positive integer less than formula_15.

If formula_21 is the distance from an arbitrary point in the plane to the centroid of a regular formula_15-gon with circumradius formula_23, then

:formula_24,
where formula_19 = 1, 2, …, formula_26.

====Interior points====
For a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the &quot;n&quot; sides is &quot;n&quot; times the apothem (the apothem being the distance from the center to any side). This is a generalization of Viviani&#x27;s theorem for the &quot;n&quot; = 3 case.

===Circumradius===
The circumradius &quot;R&quot; from the center of a regular polygon to one of the vertices is related to the side length &quot;s&quot; or to the apothem &quot;a&quot; by
:formula_27

For constructible polygons, algebraic expressions for these relationships exist .

The sum of the perpendiculars from a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon&#x27;s vertices to any line tangent to the circumcircle equals &quot;n&quot; times the circumradius.

The sum of the squared distances from the vertices of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon to any point on its circumcircle equals 2&quot;nR&quot;2 where &quot;R&quot; is the circumradius.

The sum of the squared distances from the midpoints of the sides of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon to any point on the circumcircle is 2&quot;nR&quot;2 − &quot;ns&quot;2, where &quot;s&quot; is the side length and &quot;R&quot; is the circumradius.
If formula_14 are the distances from the vertices of a regular formula_15-gon to any point on its circumcircle, then 

:formula_30.

=== Dissections===
Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2&quot;m&quot;-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into formula_31 or parallelograms.
These tilings are contained as subsets of vertices, edges and faces in orthogonal projections &quot;m&quot;-cubes.
In particular, this is true for any regular polygon with an even number of sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi.
The list gives the number of solutions for smaller polygons.
===Area===
The area &quot;A&quot; of a convex regular &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon having side &quot;s&quot;, circumradius &quot;R&quot;, apothem &quot;a&quot;, and perimeter &quot;p&quot; is given by
formula_32

For regular polygons with side &quot;s&quot; = 1, circumradius &quot;R&quot; = 1, or apothem &quot;a&quot; = 1, this produces the following table: (Since formula_33 as formula_34, the area when formula_35 tends to formula_36 as formula_15 grows large.)


Of all &quot;n&quot;-gons with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is regular.

== Constructible polygon==
Some regular polygons are easy to construct with compass and straightedge; other regular polygons are not constructible at all.
The ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to construct a regular polygon with 3, 4, or 5 sides, and they knew how to construct a regular polygon with double the number of sides of a given regular polygon. This led to the question being posed: is it possible to construct &quot;all&quot; regular &quot;n&quot;-gons with compass and straightedge? If not, which &quot;n&quot;-gons are constructible and which are not?

Carl Friedrich Gauss proved the constructibility of the regular 17-gon in 1796. Five years later, he developed the theory of Gaussian periods in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;. This theory allowed him to formulate a sufficient condition for the constructibility of regular polygons:

: A regular &quot;n&quot;-gon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if &quot;n&quot; is the product of a power of 2 and any number of distinct Fermat primes (including none).

(A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form formula_38) Gauss stated without proof that this condition was also necessary, but never published his proof. A full proof of necessity was given by Pierre Wantzel in 1837. The result is known as the Gauss–Wantzel theorem.

Equivalently, a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is constructible if and only if the cosine of its common angle is a constructible number—that is, can be written in terms of the four basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of square roots.

==Regular skew polygons==
A &quot;regular skew polygon&quot; in 3-space can be seen as nonplanar paths zig-zagging between two parallel planes, defined as the side-edges of a uniform antiprism. All edges and internal angles are equal.
More generally &quot;regular skew polygons&quot; can be defined in &quot;n&quot;-space. Examples include the Petrie polygons, polygonal paths of edges that divide a regular polytope into two halves, and seen as a regular polygon in orthogonal projection.

In the infinite limit &quot;regular skew polygons&quot; become skew apeirogons.
==Regular star polygons==
A non-convex regular polygon is a regular star polygon. The most common example is the pentagram, which has the same vertices as a pentagon, but connects alternating vertices.

For an &quot;n&quot;-sided star polygon, the Schläfli symbol is modified to indicate the &quot;density&quot; or &quot;starriness&quot; &quot;m&quot; of the polygon, as {&quot;n&quot;/&quot;m&quot;}. If &quot;m&quot; is 2, for example, then every second point is joined. If &quot;m&quot; is 3, then every third point is joined. The boundary of the polygon winds around the center &quot;m&quot; times.

The (non-degenerate) regular stars of up to 12 sides are:
*Pentagram – {5/2}
*Heptagram – {7/2} and {7/3}
*Octagram – {8/3}
*Enneagram – {9/2} and {9/4}
*Decagram – {10/3}
*Hendecagram – {11/2}, {11/3}, {11/4} and {11/5}
*Dodecagram – {12/5}

&quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; must be coprime, or the figure will degenerate.

The degenerate regular stars of up to 12 sides are:
*Tetragon – {4/2}
*Hexagons – {6/2}, {6/3}
*Octagons – {8/2}, {8/4}
*Enneagon – {9/3}
*Decagons – {10/2}, {10/4}, and {10/5}
*Dodecagons – {12/2}, {12/3}, {12/4}, and {12/6}
Depending on the precise derivation of the Schläfli symbol, opinions differ as to the nature of the degenerate figure. For example, {6/2} may be treated in either of two ways:
* For much of the 20th century (see for example ), we have commonly taken the /2 to indicate joining each vertex of a convex {6} to its near neighbors two steps away, to obtain the regular compound of two triangles, or hexagram. Coxeter clarifies this regular compound with a notation {kp}[k{p}]{kp} for the compound {p/k}, so the hexagram is represented as {6}[2{3}]{6}. More compactly Coxeter also writes &quot;2&quot;{n/2}, like &quot;2&quot;{3} for a hexagram as compound as alternations of regular even-sided polygons, with italics on the leading factor to differentiate it from the coinciding interpretation.
* Many modern geometers, such as Grünbaum (2003), regard this as incorrect. They take the /2 to indicate moving two places around the {6} at each step, obtaining a &quot;double-wound&quot; triangle that has two vertices superimposed at each corner point and two edges along each line segment. Not only does this fit in better with modern theories of abstract polytopes, but it also more closely copies the way in which Poinsot (1809) created his star polygons – by taking a single length of wire and bending it at successive points through the same angle until the figure closed.

==Duality of regular polygons ==
All regular polygons are self-dual to congruency, and for odd &quot;n&quot; they are self-dual to identity.

In addition, the regular star figures (compounds), being composed of regular polygons, are also self-dual.

==Regular polygons as faces of polyhedra==
A uniform polyhedron has regular polygons as faces, such that for every two vertices there is an isometry mapping one into the other (just as there is for a regular polygon).

A quasiregular polyhedron is a uniform polyhedron which has just two kinds of face alternating around each vertex.

A regular polyhedron is a uniform polyhedron which has just one kind of face.

The remaining (non-uniform) convex polyhedra with regular faces are known as the Johnson solids.

A polyhedron having regular triangles as faces is called a deltahedron.

<text>Martin Pierre Brodeur (; born May 6, 1972) is a Canadian–American former professional ice hockey goaltender and current team executive. He played 22 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), 21 of them for the New Jersey Devils, with whom he won three Stanley Cup championships and five Eastern Conference championships in 17 postseason campaigns. He also won two Olympic gold medals with Team Canada in the 2002 and 2010 Winter Olympic Games, as well as several other medals with Team Canada in other international competitions. Brodeur is widely regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders of all time. In 2017, he was named by the league as one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot;, and the following year, he was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Brodeur holds numerous NHL and franchise records among goaltenders; he ranks as the league&#x27;s all-time regular season leader in wins (691), losses (397), shutouts (125), and games played (1,266). He won at least 30 games in twelve straight seasons between 1995–96 and 2007–08 and is the only goaltender in NHL history with eight 40-win seasons. He is a four-time Vezina Trophy winner, a five-time William M. Jennings Trophy winner, a ten-time NHL All-Star, and a Calder Memorial Trophy winner. He is one of 14 NHL goaltenders to score a goal in the regular season and the second to do so in the playoffs; his three goals are the most of any NHL goaltender.

Brodeur used a hybrid style of goaltending by standing up more than typical butterfly style goaltenders, though he adapted to more modern techniques at the latter stage of his career. He was known for his puck handling, his positional play, and his reflexes, especially with his glove hand. Brodeur&#x27;s prowess at puck handling was so well known that it led in part to the NHL changing its rules to restrict where goaltenders were allowed to handle the puck outside of the goal crease, adding what is known as &quot;the Brodeur rule&quot;. He announced his retirement in the middle of the 2014–15 season after a brief stint with the St. Louis Blues, having played in seven games with the team. He is the current executive vice president of business development for the Devils.

==Early life==
Brodeur was born on May 6, 1972, in Montreal. He is one of five children of Denis and Mireille Brodeur. Denis played in the 1956 Olympics for Team Canada and won a bronze medal. After his playing career, Denis was a longtime photographer for the Montreal Canadiens. For more than 20 years, he attended all Montreal games and practices, and when Martin was old enough, he came along. Brodeur idolized Canadiens goaltender Patrick Roy.

Brodeur started playing hockey as a forward. His goaltending career began when his coach asked him if he wanted to play as a backup at the position in a youth tournament. Brodeur explained:

When he was 12 years old, Brodeur briefly intended to stop playing hockey, after he had been removed from his team&#x27;s lineup for not showing up at a game. Following a conversation with his brother Claude, though, he decided to continue playing. When receiving goaltending instructions in his teens, Brodeur was taught a variety of different styles, ranging from butterfly to stand-up, and paid attention to the technique of others playing the position. He attended a camp run by retired Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak, who encouraged the use of multiple methods; Brodeur believes that the concept made him &quot;a student of the game.&quot; In the 1989–90 season, he made it to the Quebec Major Junior League. While playing with the Saint-Hyacinthe Laser, Brodeur made the QMJHL All-Rookie team in 1989–90 and the QMJHL Second All-Star Team in 1991–92. Brodeur was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the first round (20th overall) in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft.

==NHL career==

===New Jersey Devils===

====1991–1995====
In the 1991–92 NHL season, Brodeur spent most of his time with Saint-Hyacinthe in the QMJHL, but was called up to the NHL on an emergency basis for four games when New Jersey goaltenders Chris Terreri and Craig Billington became injured. Brodeur won his NHL debut against the Boston Bruins, 4–2, and played in one playoff game that season. Brodeur spent the following season with the Utica Devils of the American Hockey League (AHL). However, in the 1993–94 season, Brodeur returned to the NHL permanently and gained recognition when he won the Calder Trophy, an annual award for the best rookie in the NHL. He led the Devils to the second-best record in the league and the Eastern Conference Finals in the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Rangers in seven games. He finished second in goals against average (GAA) (2.40) and fourth in save percentage (.915) in 47 games played during the regular season, helping him eventually land the starting job over Terreri.
In the 1994–95 NHL season, which was shortened to 48 games due to an extended lockout, the Devils finished tied for ninth overall, fifth in their conference. With the leadership of Brodeur, they defeated the Boston Bruins in the first round, shutting them out in three of their four wins. In the second round against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Brodeur gave up nine goals and helped the Devils defeat the Penguins in five games. In the third round, the Devils defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in six games, giving them their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in franchise history, against the heavily favoured Detroit Red Wings. The strong play of Brodeur and the Devils&#x27; &quot;trap&quot; method of defence made the series lopsided in favour of New Jersey, who swept the Red Wings 4 games to 0 while holding them to just seven goals in four games. Brodeur won a Stanley Cup in his second full season in the NHL. After the victory, he was quoted as saying:

====1995–1999====
After a year of success, the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the 1995–96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team&#x27;s 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goaltender, while having the second-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league&#x27;s top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals.

In the 1996–97 season, the Devils finished third in the NHL. Brodeur was runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, was named to the All-Star team, and had the lowest goals against average by a goaltender in almost 30 years, earning him the Jennings Trophy. He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save percentage. On April 17, 1997, in the first game of a first-round playoff matchup against the Montreal Canadiens, Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens&#x27; empty net to ensure a 5–2 victory. It was the second time in NHL history that a goaltender had scored in the playoffs, and the fifth time overall. The Devils went on to win that series, but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers.

The following year, Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular season. The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. Once again, Brodeur made the All-Star Team, finished as a runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, and won the Jennings Trophy.

In the 1998–99 season, the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year, with Brodeur winning 39 games. He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the All-Star game, making his fourth appearance. However, the Devils lost in the first round to the Penguins. It was Brodeur&#x27;s worst playoff performance statistically, as he allowed 20 goals in seven games with an .856 save percentage.

====1999–2004====
During the 1999–2000 season, on February 15, 2000, Brodeur was credited with his second career goal, as Brodeur was the last Devils player on the ice to touch the puck before Daymond Langkow of the Flyers accidentally put the puck into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils. Brodeur had previously stopped an attempted Flyers shot.

That season, Brodeur won 43 games for the second time in his career, and the Devils finished with the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference after losing the division to the Flyers by two points. Brodeur helped the Devils sweep the Florida Panthers in the first round, giving up six goals in four games. In the next round against the Toronto Maple Leafs he recorded two shutouts, including one in Game 6 of the series as the Devils won 4–2, setting up a showdown with rival Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Flyers took a 3–1 series lead and could close out the series at First Union Center in Philadelphia, but Brodeur gave up only one goal in each of the remaining three games of the series, propelling the Devils to a comeback series victory in seven games. They went on to play the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals, who had a higher seed but one fewer regular season points, giving the Devils home-ice advantage in the series. After taking game one with a seven-goal rally against Dallas, Brodeur led the Devils the rest of the way as he gave up six goals in the next five games, giving the team their second Stanley Cup Championship in six years.

The next year, Brodeur topped the 40-win mark for the third time in his career, despite having an average GAA and save-percentage throughout the season. He played in the All-Star Game for the sixth consecutive season, and helped the Devils earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round Brodeur recorded two shutouts against the Carolina Hurricanes and the Devils took the series in six games. After struggling to beat seventh-seeded Toronto in seven games, the Devils defeated the sixth-seeded Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals, where Brodeur added two more shutouts, both on the road. In their second straight Stanley Cup Finals appearance, the Devils played a back-and-forth series against the top seeded Colorado Avalanche, and lost in seven games.
In the 2001–02 season, Brodeur finished among the league leaders in wins and GAA. Brodeur continued to lead the league in victories and remained a Vezina and MVP candidate. However, the Devils lost in the first round to the Hurricanes. The next season, in 2002–03, Brodeur won the Vezina Trophy for the first time. He also won the Jennings Trophy again, was a Hart Memorial Trophy finalist for the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, and was named a First Team All-Star and started in the All-Star Game. With one of the most impressive playoff performances of his career, Brodeur guided the Devils to their third Stanley Cup victory after seven-game series wins against the top-seeded Ottawa Senators and the seventh-seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He posted 3 shutouts against Anaheim and had a playoff total of 7 overall, breaking the NHL record of 6 that had been set by Dominik Hašek the previous year. Despite this, the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP was awarded to Anaheim goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère, who became the first player not on the championship team to be named playoff MVP since Ron Hextall of Philadelphia in 1987. Some hockey writers speculated a New Jersey player did not win because there were multiple candidates, resulting in a split vote among the sportswriters who selected the winner.

In the 2003–04 season, Brodeur won his second consecutive Vezina Trophy and Jennings Trophy. He was a first Team All-Star, a starter in the NHL All-Star Game, and a finalist for the Hart Trophy again. The Devils lost the Atlantic Division title by 1 point to the Philadelphia Flyers, who thus obtained the third seed and home ice advantage against the sixth-seeded Devils in the first round of the playoffs. This would be too much for Brodeur and the Devils to overcome, as the Flyers went on to defeat them in five games.

====The Brodeur Rule====

After the 2004–05 lockout and before the start of the 2005–06 season, the league instituted a new rule preventing goaltenders from playing the puck behind the goal line, except within a trapezoid-shaped zone located behind the net. The trapezoid began at the goal line with angled lines six feet from each goal post and widened to 28 feet at the end boards. This meant that if Brodeur or any other goaltenders played the puck behind the goal line and not in the trapezoid, a two-minute minor penalty for delay of game would be assessed. Former Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke was one of the leaders in getting the trapezoid implemented. This was viewed by many as singling out Brodeur, who was one of the best at getting behind the net to handle the puck, and has come to be known as the &quot;Brodeur Rule&quot;.

At the 2009 NHL General Managers&#x27; Meeting, it was discussed whether the rule should be eliminated as a solution to the increasing number of injuries on defenceman who were being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, &quot;If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they&#x27;ll mess up more than they&#x27;re successful.&quot; He also expressed his concern for defencemen, &quot;It&#x27;s a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen ... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I&#x27;ve got to sit and watch all the time ... You&#x27;ve got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt.&quot; At the time of his statement, Devils defencemen Paul Martin, Johnny Oduya and Bryce Salvador were all out with injuries.

Ultimately the suggestion was rejected and the rule stayed in place. Former Maple Leafs&#x27; general manager Brian Burke said, &quot;We had originally approved a rule where the goaltenders couldn&#x27;t handle the puck behind the net at all. The game was turning into a tennis match. You&#x27;d dump it in and the goalie would throw it out and now with the soft chip into the corner it turns into a puck battle and a forecheck opportunity, which is what we wanted.&quot;

The rule was later adopted into the KHL rulebook for the 2019–20 KHL season, and the IIHF rulebook in 2021.

====2005–2009====
After the 2004–05 NHL lockout canceled the 2004–05 season, Brodeur signed a contract extension with the Devils on January 27, 2006, that would pay him $31.2 million over six years. In the 2005–06 season he posted 43 wins, adding onto his NHL records of what were now five 40-win seasons and ten consecutive 30-win seasons. After struggling early in the season, his improved play later on made him a finalist for the Vezina Trophy for the third straight year, and helped lead the Devils to a surprising comeback in the last two months of the season that resulted in them winning the Atlantic Division in the final game of the year. In the first round of the playoffs, he won a postseason series against the Rangers for the first time in his career, leading the Devils to a four-game sweep. But a 4–1 series loss to the Carolina Hurricanes eliminated the Devils in the next round.
In the 2006–07 season, Brodeur made his ninth NHL All-Star Game appearance in Dallas, Texas, won his third Vezina Trophy and rose on several NHL records lists. On December 8, 2006, he posted a 2–0 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers for his 462nd career win, moving him into second place on the all-time list ahead of Ed Belfour. Just a few weeks later, on December 26, Brodeur beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3–0 to record his 85th career shutout, moving him past Glenn Hall for third place on that all-time list and first place among all active goaltenders. On February 1, 2007, Brodeur beat the Philadelphia Flyers 6–5 in overtime to take the all-time lead in overtime (non-shootout) wins with 45, passing Roy. The Devils&#x27; first 38 wins of the season were all with Brodeur in net, leading him to set an NHL record for most consecutive wins for a team.

On April 3, 2007, Brodeur tied the NHL record for most wins in a single season with 47, set by Bernie Parent in 1973–74, in a 2–1 shootout victory against the Ottawa Senators. Two days later, he broke the record with his 48th win in a 3–2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers, which helped the Devils clinch the Atlantic Division title.

In the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the Tampa Bay Lightning, Brodeur started out shaky and the Devils fell behind two games to one. He rebounded, however, to finish the series, and helped the team advance in six games, while passing Grant Fuhr for second place in all-time playoff victories. In the second round against the Ottawa Senators, the Devils were defeated in five games as the Senators scored 15 goals during the series.

In the 2007–08 season, Brodeur became the second goaltender in NHL history to reach 500 wins with a victory against the Flyers on November 17, 2007. The only other goaltenders to achieve the feat are Roy and Marc-André Fleury. Brodeur was also named the starting goaltender for the Eastern Conference in the 2007–08 NHL All Star Game in Atlanta. However, he was unable to participate because of a family obligation.
After losing a bitter series against the rival Rangers in the opening round of the 2008 NHL playoffs, Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery&#x27;s hand. During game three of the series, in an unusual move, Avery turned to face Brodeur during a 5-on-3 power play, and began waving his hands and stick in front of Brodeur&#x27;s face in an effort to distract him. The day after this game the NHL announced that it had revised its unsportsmanlike conduct rule, now known as The Sean Avery Rule, effectively outlawing such antics.

Brodeur started wearing a new painted mask design for the 2008–09 NHL season with a stylized &quot;MB30&quot; on the front, replacing the &quot;J&quot; that had been on his mask for nearly his entire NHL career. During a game on November 1, 2008, Brodeur suffered a &quot;bruised elbow&quot; which would later be diagnosed as a torn distal biceps tendon, the first major injury in his career. Following surgery on November 6, he would miss 16 weeks of the season before playing his next game on February 26, 2009. Upon returning from the injury, Brodeur registered a 4–0 shutout against the Colorado Avalanche for his 99th career shutout. Three days later, he recorded his 100th career shutout against the Philadelphia Flyers, three short of Terry Sawchuk&#x27;s NHL record.

====2009–2014====
Beginning in 2009, Brodeur broke a number of career records for goaltenders. He missed 50 games in the 2008–09 season, but a winning streak upon his return pushed him near the NHL&#x27;s all-time win record. On March 14, 2009, the Devils defeated the Canadiens 3–1 to give him the 551st win of his career, tying him with Roy for the NHL record. Three days later, Brodeur surpassed Roy with a 3–2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks in New Jersey.

Brodeur topped another of Roy&#x27;s previous marks on November 27, as he set the record for the most minutes played in the NHL, which had been 60,235. His 1,030th career appearance, which happened on December 18, broke Roy&#x27;s record of 1,029. He also set the mark for the most regular-season shutouts with a 4–0 win against the Penguins on December 21, breaking Sawchuk&#x27;s record of 103. On December 30, 2009, Brodeur and the Devils shut out the Penguins, 2–0. It was his 105th career shutout, giving him the all-time professional record, surpassing George Hainsworth&#x27;s total of 104 combined in the NHL (94) and Western Canada Hockey League (10). On April 6, 2010, Brodeur reached his 600th career win by defeating the Thrashers 3–0. This was also his 110th career shutout.
In the 2009–10 NHL season, Brodeur led the NHL in wins (45), shutouts (9), games played (77) and minutes played (4,499). He also won his fifth Jennings Trophy and had the third-best GAA in the league, leading his team to back-to-back division wins that included a 6–0 regular-season sweep of the defending Stanley Cup champion Penguins. However, the Devils lost in the first round of the playoffs, losing to the seventh-seeded Flyers in five games.

Brodeur had a 5–18–1 stretch to begin the 2010–11 season, as New Jersey slumped to the bottom of the NHL. Although the Devils improved in the second half of the season, they did not reach the playoffs; Brodeur recorded 23 wins and a 2.45 GAA, but had his lowest save percentage (.903) in 16 seasons.

The Devils returned to the playoffs in the 2011–12 NHL season, as Brodeur recorded his 14th 30-win season. In Game 1 of the conference quarterfinals against the Panthers, Brodeur became the second goaltender to record 100 playoff wins in a 3–2 Devils victory. In Game 4 with a 4–0 victory, Brodeur broke the NHL career playoff shutout record with his 24th, surpassing Roy, who had 23. The Devils advanced by winning Game 7 in double overtime, after Brodeur had made 43 saves to keep his team in the contest.

Following a second round series win over the Flyers, Brodeur and the Devils defeated the Rangers four games to two in the Eastern Conference finals. New Jersey won the sixth game 3–2 on an overtime goal by Adam Henrique, leading to Brodeur&#x27;s fifth Stanley Cup Finals appearance. The Devils lost in the Finals to the Los Angeles Kings in six games. Brodeur was 14–10 in the postseason with a save percentage of .917, after winning 16 playoff games in the previous eight years.
During the off-season of 2012, Brodeur hired agent Pat Brisson, leading many analysts to believe he would test free-agency or retire. However, on July 2, 2012, Brodeur agreed to a two-year, $9 million deal to remain with the Devils, alongside backup goaltender Johan Hedberg. On March 21, 2013, in his first game back from a month-long absence due to a pinched nerve injury in his upper back, Brodeur was credited with a power play goal against the Carolina Hurricanes, making him the only NHL goaltender to record three career goals, and the first goaltender to score on the power play since Evgeni Nabokov in 2002. Brodeur had a 13–9–7 record in his 29 appearances in 2012–13, with a 2.22 GAA.

The following season, he shared the Devils&#x27; starting goaltender position with Cory Schneider, whose 45 games played were six more than Brodeur&#x27;s total. Brodeur&#x27;s statistical performance declined, as his GAA increased to 2.51, more than half a goal higher than Schneider. In 39 games played, Brodeur had a .901 save percentage, lower than the league average. Among his 19 wins in 2013–14 was a victory in the season finale against Boston, his 688th for New Jersey. On June 6, 2014, Brodeur told ESPN he would test the free agency market for the 2014–15 season, and his 21-year tenure with the Devils ended.

===St. Louis Blues===
On November 26, 2014, Brodeur signed a tryout contract with the St. Louis Blues after their starting netminder, Brian Elliott, was injured. A week later, on December 2, Brodeur signed a one-year, $700,000 deal with the Blues.

On January 27, 2015, it was reported that Brodeur had decided to retire from the NHL. The decision followed Elliott&#x27;s return to the Blues, as Brodeur had been demoted to the team&#x27;s number-three goaltender behind Elliott and Jake Allen. Brodeur announced the news at a press conference two days later. He retired having started just five games with the Blues, going 3–3–0 in seven appearances. His final NHL win was a 3–0 shutout against the Avalanche on December 29, 2014.

==Post-playing career==
Upon announcing his retirement, Brodeur was hired by the Blues as a special assistant to general manager Doug Armstrong. On May 22, 2015, Armstrong announced that Brodeur and the Blues had agreed to a three-year contract naming Brodeur as an assistant general manager of the team. On February 8, 2016, the New Jersey Devils unveiled a bronze statue of Brodeur which is displayed outside the Prudential Center. The statue was formally dedicated on October 22, 2016, in a ceremony before the game against the Minnesota Wild. On February 9, 2016, Brodeur&#x27;s number 30 jersey was retired by the Devils.

On July 25, 2017, Brodeur was appointed a management team member for Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s team for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Korea. On August 29, 2018, Brodeur joined the Devils as executive vice president of business development. On January 12, 2020, Brodeur became an advisor on hockey operations after general manager Ray Shero was fired.

==International play==




Brodeur was selected as Team Canada&#x27;s back-up goaltender to Roy for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, but did not get to play. Canada failed to win a medal after losing the bronze-medal match to Finland, a game in which many people thought Brodeur should have played.

In the 2002 Olympics at Salt Lake City, Utah, Brodeur was initially named the backup behind Curtis Joseph. But following Joseph&#x27;s losing the tournament opener against Sweden, Brodeur was named the starting goaltender the rest of the way, and won gold for Canada. He went undefeated in the tournament, stopping 31 of 33 shots in the gold-medal victory over Team USA.

Brodeur then led Team Canada to a World Cup of Hockey championship in 2004, allowing five goals in five games. He led all goaltenders in GAA and save percentage while going undefeated. He had another impressive performance for the team at the world hockey championships in the following year. After this, &quot;The Sports Forecaster 2005–06&quot; said the following:

Brodeur was selected as Team Canada&#x27;s starter in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. He started in 4 games, but Canada failed to win a medal after losing to Russia in the quarterfinals.

He was one of the three goaltenders on Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He registered a shootout win against Switzerland and a loss to the United States. After the loss to the US, he was benched for the remainder of the 2010 Games in favour of Roberto Luongo.
==Personal life==
Brodeur married Melanie Dubois (a native of Saint-Liboire, Quebec) in August 1995 with whom he has four children: Anthony, born in 1995; twin sons, William and Jeremy, born in 1996; and Anabelle Antoinette, 2002. Melanie filed for divorce during the 2003 playoffs amid reports that Brodeur was having an affair with Genevieve Nault, the wife of Melanie&#x27;s brother. The incident was referred to by opposing fans during the playoffs. The reports proved to be true, as he and Genevieve married in June 2008. Their first child together, Maxime Philippe Brodeur, was born in November 2009.

Brodeur is regarded as an engaging raconteur in his spare time. He has hosted a street hockey tournament in his hometown of Saint-Leonard, Quebec, for each of the Devils&#x27; Stanley Cup championships, where he played as a forward. His oldest brother, Denis Jr., is a photographer like their late father, Denis Brodeur, and his other older brother, Claude, was a minor league baseball pitcher in the Montreal Expos&#x27; organization. He has two sisters, Line and Sylvie.

In 2005, Brodeur began co-authoring his autobiography, &quot;Brodeur: Beyond the Crease&quot;, with long-time &quot;Toronto Star&quot; columnist and ESPN contributor Damien Cox, which was released in October 2006. Some of the things Brodeur talks about in the book are player salaries and contracts, NHL marketing, Lou Lamoriello, and the Devils&#x27; new arena in Newark, the Prudential Center. Brodeur also includes his views on the &quot;new NHL&quot; after the lockout, and how it affected his career.

Brodeur co-owns a business called La Pizzeria Etc. with former teammate Sheldon Souray. The idea came about after Souray was traded to play in Montreal, the city in which the business now operates.

Brodeur resides in New Jersey, and became a naturalized United States citizen on December 1, 2009, but per IIHF rules would only be able to compete for Canada.

On June 30, 2013, the Devils traded for the 208th pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft and Brodeur was asked to make the announcement to select his son, Anthony. In August 2015, Anthony signed with the Penticton Vees of the British Columbia Hockey League.

Fans picked Brodeur to appear on the cover of the video game &quot;NHL 14&quot;, choosing him in a series of votes that included 60 players. He was the first goaltender to have his image on the cover since John Vanbiesbrouck on &quot;NHL 97&quot;.

==Legacy==

During his NHL career, Brodeur set numerous league records. He ended his career with 691 wins, 140 more than Roy, who is second on the NHL&#x27;s all-time list. Brodeur extended his record shutout total to 125, 22 more than second-place Sawchuk. After his final season, he had played in 1,266 regular season games, a total more than 200 above that of any other goaltender. In nine seasons, Brodeur was the NHL wins leader, and in five other seasons he was among the top five goaltenders in the category. Brodeur&#x27;s honors include four Vezina Trophy wins as the top goaltender in the NHL, and the 1993–94 Calder Trophy as rookie of the year. His total of five Jennings Trophies is tied for the most in NHL history, matching Roy&#x27;s record. In postseason play, he had the most shutouts of any NHL goaltender (24), and his 113 playoff wins ranks second all-time.

Sportswriters and players have called Brodeur one of the greatest goaltenders in NHL history. &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s Kevin Allen placed Brodeur in a group including Roy and Sawchuk as the leading NHL goaltender, noting that Brodeur had the advantage in wins. Writer Steve Politi noted Brodeur&#x27;s longevity as an advantage on other top all-time goaltenders such as Roy; Brodeur played 70 or more games in 12 seasons, compared to 0 for Roy. Sportsnet&#x27;s Chris Boyle, after running a statistical analysis, placed Brodeur eighth in his all-time goaltending list; he offered the rationale that Brodeur&#x27;s teammates helped him achieve his major records, while goaltenders such as Roy and Hašek had superior stats in their best seasons.
Brodeur is remembered for his playing style: writer Katie Strang called him &quot;one of the most innovative [goalies] ever to play the game&quot;, due to his &quot;superior puck-handling skills&quot;. Scott Gomez, a former teammate of Brodeur in New Jersey, considered his goaltender to be the equivalent of an extra defenceman. A rule disallowing goaltenders from handling the puck outside a trapezoid shaped area behind the net is called &quot;The Brodeur Rule&quot; by some who believe his tendency to play the puck in the corners inspired the rule. His playing style proved uncommon among goaltenders of his era, as most of his competitors used a butterfly style exclusively.

&quot;The Salute&quot;, a bronze statue of Martin Brodeur by Jon Krawczyk, was installed outside Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey in 2016. On June 26, 2018, it was announced that Brodeur would be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2019, Brodeur was awarded the Order of Sport and inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="333314" wikidata="Q553302" url="?curid=333314" title="Viacheslav Fetisov">
<text>Viacheslav Alexandrovich &quot;Slava&quot; Fetisov (; born 20 April 1958) is a Russian former professional ice hockey defenceman, coach, politician and sports official. He played for HC CSKA Moscow for 13 seasons before joining the National Hockey League (NHL), where he played with the New Jersey Devils and Detroit Red Wings. With the Wings, he won back-to-back Stanley Cups and was part of the team&#x27;s Russian Five unit. After retiring from his playing career, he became the assistant coach for the New Jersey Devils. Having a very successful four years, he helped get the team to two Stanley Cup finals and one Stanley Cup victory. In addition to that, he won two Olympic gold medals and seven world championships. His Stanley Cup wins, Olympic gold medals, and World Championship wins make him a member of the sport&#x27;s prestigious Triple Gold Club.

Fetisov was instrumental in breaking the barrier that had prevented Soviet players from leaving the Soviet Union to join the NHL. His actions not only resulted in a number of top Soviet players joining the NHL, but encouraged many of the best players from all over Europe to go to North America. Internationally, he was a long-time captain for the Soviet Union national team and is a two-time Olympic champion. In 2002, Fetisov led the Russian Ice Hockey Olympic team as GM and head coach, attaining a bronze medal. Considered one of the best defencemen of all time, he was voted as one of six players to the International Ice Hockey Federation&#x27;s (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2005.

After retiring as a coach, Fetisov embarked on a political and executive career. After the 2002 Winter Olympics, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered him the position as Minister of Sport, a post he held until 2008. He has the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation. He is a member of the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, the Federation Council representing Primorsky Krai, the founder and chairman of the KHL&#x27;s board of directors and chair of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Athletes Committee. Fetisov was president of Russian ice hockey club HC CSKA Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He was also the key member of the bidding committee that presented the Sochi 2014 proposal to the IOC in Guatemala in 2007, when a city was being chosen to host the 2014 Winter Olympics.

Fetisov was Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the VII convocation, First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports, Tourism and Youth Affairs since 5 October 2016. Fetisov is a member of the Supreme Council of the United Russia party.

==Playing career==

===CSKA Moscow (1976–89)===
Fetisov debuted for CSKA Moscow&#x27;s junior team at sixteen years old. He joined the senior team in the Soviet Championship League in 1978–79 and recorded 29 points in 29 games as a rookie. In his fourth season, Fetisov reeled off 41 points in 46 games to be named the 1982 USSR Player of the Year. Four seasons later, he won his second Player of the Year recognition after a 34-point season in 1985–86.

===NHL career (1989–98)===
Fetisov soon expressed a desire to play in the NHL and submitted a request to Soviet officials. However, Soviet players defecting to North America was strictly discouraged at the time and his request was met with great resistance. Fetisov has recalled the Soviet Minister of Defence, Marshal Dmitry Yazov, giving him an ultimatum at the time to either apologize or be sent to Siberia. Nevertheless, at the age of 31, helped by the Soviets&#x27; newfound glasnost policy, Fetisov led a group of eight Soviet players, including Helmut Balderis, Vladimir Krutov, Igor Larionov, Sergei Makarov, Sergei Mylnikov, Sergei Priakin and Sergei Starikov, into the NHL. Soviet hockey officials agreed to allow Soviet players to play in the NHL as long as they continued to compete internationally for the Soviet Union. Still, 99% of their NHL salaries would go to the Soviet government, something Fetisov later lambasted akin to using players as slaves for profit.

Fetisov had been drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft eleven years prior. However, unable to play in North America at the time, he was re-entered into the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, where he was selected by the New Jersey Devils. Fetisov debuted with the Devils in 1989–90 and recorded eight goals and 42 points, both NHL career-highs for Fetisov.

He played in New Jersey until 1994–95, when he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in April 1995. Fetisov began producing immediately with the Red Wings, scoring 14 points in 14 games to finish the season after the trade. He helped the Red Wings to the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated by his former team, the Devils. The following season, Fetisov matched his career high in points with 42-points in 1995–96. He was named to his first NHL All-Star Game in 1997, then won back-to-back Stanley Cups with Detroit in 1997 and 1998, before announcing his retirement. He took the Stanley Cup to Moscow after the 1997 championship, where the trophy appeared for the first time in Russia.

===One-game return (2009)===
Nearly eleven years after his retirement, Fetisov came out of retirement at the age of 51 to play for CSKA Moscow in a one-game return on 11 December 2009. Head coach Sergei Nemchinov turned to Fetisov, president of the club, in need of a replacement for injured defenceman Denis Kulyash. CSKA Moscow lost the game 3–2 to SKA St. Petersburg.

==International play==

On the international stage, Fetisov is one of the most decorated players ever. As a junior, Fetisov competed for the Soviet Union at the European Junior Championships, where he won Top Defenceman honors during the 1975–76 season, en route to two consecutive gold medals at the tournament. He then helped the Soviets to three consecutive gold medals at the World Junior Championships from 1976 to 1978, taking back-to-back Top Defenceman honors in 1977 and 1978.

With the Soviet national team, Fetisov won two gold medals (1984, 1988) and one silver medal (1980) at the Olympics. At the World Championships, Fetisov won seven golds (1978, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1990), one silver (1987), and three bronzes (1977, 1985, 1991). Fetisov also won one Canada Cup in 1981. At the 2002 Olympics, he was head coach of the Russian national team, winning the bronze. Fetisov and teammate Igor Larionov, along with Scott Niedermayer, Corey Perry, Joe Sakic, Patrice Bergeron, Sidney Crosby, and Jonathan Toews are the only players to win the &quot;Grand Slam of Ice Hockey&quot;, winning the Stanley Cup, World Ice Hockey Championships, Ice Hockey Gold Medal at the Winter Olympics, World Ice Hockey Junior Championship, and Canada/World Cup Championship.

==Coaching career==
Fetisov became an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils following his playing career and won the Stanley Cup with the club in 2000 during his three-year tenure (1998–2001).

==Executive career==
Following his tenure as assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils, Fetisov was named general manager of the Russian national team for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where Russia won bronze. He was succeeded as general manager by Pavel Bure for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

On 29 March 2005 Fetisov joined the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s Athlete Committee as its inaugural chairman.

In 2009, he became president of HC CSKA Moscow. Following the injuries of CSKA&#x27;s several key defenders, Fetisov, aged 51 at the time, came out of retirement to play against SKA St Petersburg in a one-off return.

Fetisov attended the World Hockey Summit in 2010, and discussed wanting to improve KHL&#x27;s relationship with the National Hockey League (NHL) with respect to transfer agreements and player contracts. The Russian league sought greater financial compensation when its players departed for the NHL, instead of negotiating a flat rate for an unlimited number of transfers.

==Honors==
In his home country, Fetisov has been awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1984, the Order of Lenin in 1988, the Order Of Service To The Fatherland 4th class in 2000 and 3rd class 2005, the Order Of Honour in 1998, the Order of Friendship in 2007, and two Orders of the Badge of Honor. On October 22, 1981, Russian astronomer Nikolai Chernykh discovered a main-belt asteroid from the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. The asteroid was named the 8806 Fetisov after Fetisov.

In North America, Fetisov was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame on 12 November 2001 along with Mike Gartner, Dale Hawerchuk and Jari Kurri. Internationally, he has been recognized by the IIHF in the International Centennial All-Star Team. He received the most votes out of all players in a poll conducted by a group of 56 experts from 16 countries (54 of which voted for Fetisov) to assemble the historic squad.

==Personal life==
He has a daughter, Anastasia, who appeared with him in the &quot;30 for 30&quot; film &quot;Of Miracles and Men.&quot;

In June 1985, Fetisov was involved in a car accident that killed his younger brother Anatoly, who was 18 years old at the time and a prospect within the HC CSKA Moscow system.

Twelve years later, following a private party on 13 June 1997, Fetisov, along with teammate Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, hired a limousine to drive them home after celebrating the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Stanley Cup triumph. The driver, Richard Gnida, whose license was suspended at the time for drunk driving, lost control of the limousine and hit a tree on the median of Woodward Avenue, in Birmingham, Michigan, a suburb north of Detroit. Konstantinov spent several weeks in a coma before finally pulling through. He also suffered from serious head injuries and paralysis, while Fetisov escaped with relatively minor injuries and was able to play the following season. Mnatsakanov sustained heavy head injuries and also spent some time in a coma. The driver was charged and convicted.

In 2023, he expressed outrage at continued suspension of Russian athletes due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine:

In September 2008, Vedomosti reported that the Presidium of the General Council of United Russia recommended Fetisov&#x27;s candidacy for election as a representative of the legislative assembly of Primorsky Krai in the Federation Council (this seat became vacant after Igor Pushkaryov, who represented the regional legislature, was elected mayor of Vladivostok in May of the same year). On the same day, Fetisov consented to become a seaside senator. On 17 October 2008, he was elected a member of the Federation Council from Primorsky Krai.

<text>The Combined Counties Football League is a regional men&#x27;s football league in south-eastern England with members in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Jersey, Kent, Middlesex, Oxfordshire, Surrey, and the western half of Greater London, featuring a number of semi-professional clubs. It is sponsored by Cherry Red Records and is officially known as the Cherry Red Records Combined Counties Football League.

It was founded in 1922 as the Surrey Senior League and was renamed in 1978 to the Combined Counties League. Initially, the league was a single division, but it consists now of 63 teams in three divisions: Premier Division North, Premier Division South and Division One. The league also has a new Division Two of nine teams, many being reserve and development teams, six teams competing in an Under-23 Development Division, known as the John Bennett Development Division, and 20 Under-18 teams split across North and South divisions, known as the Tony Ford Under-18 Youth Divisions. These four divisions are outside the National League System.

The Premier Divisions North and South are two of sixteen recognised leagues to form the ninth level of the English football league system (known as Step 5 of the National League System), and Division One is one of seventeen recognised leagues at level 10 (known as Step 6 of the National League System). The Combined Counties Football League is a feeder to the Isthmian League and the Southern League.

==History==
The league was renamed on 18 June 1978 when the Surrey Senior League underwent a metamorphosis to try to attract clubs from outside the county. The expanded league was initially called the Home Counties League but there was an objection to the title from the Home Counties Conference, which forced the league to change its name.

The league had a verbal agreement with the Surrey County Football Association to revert to a similar title to the former league – the Surrey Senior Football League. However, this name was later rejected as the Surrey County Football Association intended to reform the Surrey Senior League at a later date. It was first suggested by the FA that the league should be called the Corinthian Football League, but this was frowned upon by the Athenian Football League within which the old Corinthian Football League had been incorporated. The alternative suggestion, the Combined Counties Football League, was approved for the 1979–80 season.

With increasing numbers for the 1981–82 season, the clubs were split into two equal divisions: the Eastern Division and the Western Division. The winners then met in a two-legged play-off final, with Ash United winning 3–0 in aggregate against Malden Town. The league reverted to a single division for the 1982–83 season.

The league began with nine founder-member clubs and continued to steadily grow, resulting in the league becoming a feeder to the Isthmian League in 1984 with 16–18 teams usually competing in the Combined Counties Football League. Southwick became the first team promoted to the Isthmian League from a feeder club in 1985, and Chertsey Town followed a year later.

In 1987, the league announced a four-year sponsorship agreement with Dan-Air worth a five figure sum. As part of the agreement, the league became known as the Dan-Air Football League and a representative team was introduced. The Dan-Air Class Elite Cup was also launched in 1989.

The Dan-Air Youth League was formed for the 1991–92 season and opened to youth teams from all member clubs. However, the league attracted just seven clubs for the inaugural season and reluctantly abandoned the competition after one year. With the Dan-Air sponsorship coming to an end at the end of the season, the league agreed a sponsorship deal with Parasol Professional Portrait Photography and became known as the Parasol Combined Counties Football League. The League Challenge Cup became known as the Parasol Challenge Cup, and the Dan-Air Class Elite Cup was replaced by the Frazer Freight Vase with sponsorship from Frazer Freight International.

Ahead of the 1997–98 season, the league received further sponsorship and subsequently became known as the Courage Combined Counties Football League. In 2002, the league reached a membership of 24 clubs – most notably with the addition of AFC Wimbledon. The introduction of AFC Wimbledon proved invaluable for the league&#x27;s other clubs. With crowds of up to 4,000 spectators for their home clubs, many clubs would break their attendance records when AFC Wimbledon visited their ground which could generate substantial matchday revenue. The club&#x27;s first matches in the league also required large numbers of police to control crowds, including mounted police and patrolling helicopters.

In 2002, the league began a three-year sponsorship agreement to become the Seagrave Haulage Combined Counties Football League, although Seagrave pulled out of the deal after one season.

Following the National League System Conference in July 2002, the Combined Counties Football League and the Surrey County Senior League entered into discussions. This resulted in the two leagues merging for the 2003–04 season, forming a league with 40 clubs that would operate across the fourth and fifth steps of non-league football with a Premier Division and Division One.

Another new sponsorship for the 2005–06 season, this time with Cherry Red Records, saw the league become known as the Cherry Red Records Combined Counties Football League.

In 2011, the league accepted the membership of newly-founded club Guernsey. The arrival of the team meant that clubs would fly or take a ferry over to the Channel Islands in order to fulfil their fixtures, with Guernsey covering the expenses as a requirement of their membership. Backed by former England international Matt Le Tissier, who made a one-off appearance in the Combined Counties Football League in 2013, they won the Combined Counties Football League Division One and Combined Counties Premier Challenge Cup in their first season.

In May 2018, Westfield and premier division runners up, Bedfont Sports, were promoted to the Bostik (Isthmian) Football League due to The FA&#x27;s decision to restructure steps 3 and 4 of the National League System. It was the first time that two teams had been promoted in one season.

The 2019–20 season was abandoned as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. The pandemic led to further disruptions in the 2020-21 season, with it starting in September, before being suspended in December and eventually curtailed in February 2021 by restrictions from COVID-19 lockdowns. The FA later announced on 12 April that the Combined Counties League would administer a new Step 5 division from 2021–22 after another scheduled NLS restructuring had a one-season postponement due to the pandemic.

At the end of April 2023, the Combined Counties League announced the formation of the new Division Two, mostly for reserve teams and under-23 development sides of the league&#x27;s member clubs, to which the FA granted sanction. It has currently not been granted a step on the football pyramid.

==Promotion rules and cups==
Its rules allow up to three teams to be promoted and relegated between either Premier division and Division One; promotion is dependent on the clubs finishing in the top three of Division One each having the correct ground-grading. 
Division One is &quot;fed&quot; by the county leagues at level 11, the former Step 7 of the National League System, such as the Surrey Premier County Football League, the Middlesex County League and the Thames Valley Premier Football League.

The League organises three cups. 
#The Premier Challenge Cup is competed for by the teams in all three divisions. 
#The Division One Cup is competed for by teams exclusively in Division One.
#The Grant McLellan Youth Cup is competed for by current and ex-member clubs who have teams playing in the under-18 age group in other leagues.

The Southern Combination Challenge Cup has been labelled &quot;a supplementary Combined Counties League Cup&quot; and includes some clubs in the Isthmian League and other leagues.

<text>The Isthmian League () is a regional football league covering Greater London, East and South East England, featuring mostly semi-professional clubs.

Founded in 1905 by amateur clubs in the London area, the league now consists of 88 teams in four divisions: the Premier Division above its three feeder divisions, the North, South Central and South East divisions.

Together with the Southern League and the Northern Premier League, it forms the seventh and eighth levels of the English football league system. It has various regional feeder leagues and the league as a whole is a feeder league mainly to the National League South.

==History==
Before the Isthmian League was formed, there were no leagues in which amateur football clubs could compete, only knock-out cup competitions. Therefore, a meeting took place between representatives of Casuals, Civil Service, Clapton, Ealing Association, Ilford and London Caledonians to discuss the creation of a strong amateur league. All the clubs supported the idea and the Isthmian League was born on 7 March 1905. Membership of the league was through invitation only. The league was very strongly dedicated to the cause of amateurism in sport; consequently, the champions of the league did not even receive a trophy or medals; the league&#x27;s Latin motto was &quot;honor sufficit&quot; (&#x27;honour is sufficient&#x27;).

Thus, those clubs less able to compete financially gravitated to it rather than to the Southern League, which attracted clubs with ambition and money. Although the Isthmian League established itself as one of the strongest amateur leagues in the country, routinely providing the winners of the FA Amateur Cup, it was still regarded as being at a lower level than the Southern League, which had developed into the top regional semi-professional league. By 1922 the Isthmian League had fourteen clubs and over the next five decades, only a few new members were admitted, mainly to fill vacancies left by clubs leaving the league. Most new Isthmian League members joined from the Athenian League, which was similarly dedicated to amateurism.

The Isthmian League was most likely named after the ancient Isthmian Games, with the later Athenian League, Corinthian League, Delphian League, Spartan League, Parthenon League and Aetolian League all adding a Classical Greek flavour to amateur football competition. In 1962 an &#x27;all-star&#x27; team from the Isthmian League entered the 1962 Ugandan Independence Tournament, drawing both their games versus Kenya and Ghana.

The league finally began to permit professionalism in the mid-1970s when the Football Association abolished the long-standing distinction between amateur and professional status with effect from the 1974–75 season. A second division of sixteen clubs was formed in 1973 and a third division followed in 1977. However, the league still remained officious and refused to participate in the formation of the Alliance Premier League in 1979 and whilst two Isthmian clubs, Enfield and Dagenham, defected to the APL in 1981, it was not until 1985 that the Isthmian League champions were given a promotion place to the newly renamed Football Conference. The reward of promotion into the Conference means that, since 1985, no team has won the league champions title two seasons in succession (as had happened on 22 occasions previously). The Athenian League disbanded in 1984 when the Isthmian League Second Division split into North and South Divisions. These were restructured yet again to Second and Third Divisions in 1991.

In 2002, the league was restructured once more, with the First and Second Divisions merging to become Division One North and Division One South (later renamed simply the North and South divisions), and the Third Division being renamed as Division Two. In addition, the league&#x27;s three feeder leagues—the Combined Counties League, Essex Senior League and Spartan South Midlands League—ran in parallel with Division Two, and were able to feed directly into the regional Division Ones.

In 2004, The Football Association pushed through a major restructuring of the entire national non-league National League System, creating new regional divisions of the Football Conference feeding into the top, national, level. As a consequence of this restructuring, the Isthmian League was reduced back down to three divisions, and its boundaries were changed to remove the overlap with the Southern League.

In 2006, further reorganisation saw a reversion to two regional Division Ones and the disbandment of Division Two. This current plan calls for clubs based on the edges of the Isthmian League&#x27;s territory to transfer to and from the Southern League as necessary to maintain numerical balance between the leagues. One team, Clapton, who were ever present in the Isthmian League since its foundation, were moved to the Essex Senior League for the 2006–07 season. Dulwich Hamlet, who had joined the league in 1907, became its longest serving member until their promotion to the National League South for the 2018–19 season.

In May 2017, The Football Association chose the Isthmian League to add a third regional division at Step 4 as part of further restructuring in the National League System, reducing all divisions at Step 4 to 20 teams. The new division started play in the 2018–19 season.

===Sponsorship===
The Isthmian League was the first league to have sponsorship, having been selected by Rothmans, who sponsored the league from 1973 to 1977. The company offered prize money for position in the league but money was deducted for bookings. Thus the money encouraged both more goals and fair play. The sponsors after Rothmans to the present day have been: Michael Lawrie (1977–78), Berger (1978–82), Servowarm (1982–85), Vauxhall-Opel (1985–90), Vauxhall (1990–91), Diadora (1991–95), ICIS (1995–97), Ryman (1997–2017), Bostik (2017–19) and BetVictor (2019–20). Entain&#x27;s Pitching In was announced as the next sponsor for 2020–21. At the time of announcement, Entain went by its former name GVC Holdings. Under this partnership, Isthmian is marketed as one of the three Trident Leagues, alongside the Northern Premier and Southern leagues.

Ryman also sponsored the Isthmian Youth League and Isthmian Development League upon their creations in 2007 and 2013 respectively. Ryman chairman Theo Paphitis added to his league sponsorship through his flagship companies. Robert Dyas became sponsors of the Isthmian League Cup, Isthmian Veterans Cup, Isthmian Disability Cup and Isthmian Youth Play-off Cup in 2014, and Boux Avenue sponsored the Isthmian Women&#x27;s Cup from 2014 to 2017.

Becoming the longest running sports sponsorship in UK football, Ryman stepped down as sponsors at the end of the 2016–17 season after 20 years.

==League Cup==
The Alan Turvey Trophy, formerly the Isthmian League Cup, has run since 1975 and involves all Isthmian League teams.

== Former members ==
Several previous members of the Isthmian League have reached the English Football League. In its earlier years, the Football League didn&#x27;t directly promote teams from the Non-League system on merit; instead, holding regular elections, for which any Non-League side could apply to enter. In practice, only the most ambitious non-League sides put themselves forward for election, and success was uncommon (outside of divisional expansions, from 1945 to its abolition in 1987, only seven clubs were successful in vying for admission to the League). No Isthmian League member ever put themselves forward for election to the Football League, but Wimbledon were elected as a Southern League member, having left the Isthmian League in 1964.

The first ex-Isthmian League team to reach the Football League was Wimbledon in 1977, followed subsequently by Maidstone United (1989), Wycombe Wanderers (1993), Yeovil Town (2003), Dagenham &amp; Redbridge (2007), Aldershot Town (2008), Stevenage (2010), and AFC Wimbledon (2011). Sutton United, who had been in the Isthmian League as recently as 2011, became the most recent former member to be promoted to the Football League, winning promotion in 2021.

<text>A Canadian postal code () is a six-character string that forms part of a postal address in Canada. Like British, Irish, Dutch, and Argentinian postcodes, Canada&#x27;s postal codes are alphanumeric. They are in the format &quot;A1A 1A1&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; is a letter and &quot;1&quot; is a digit, with a space separating the third and fourth characters. As of October 2019, there were 876,445 postal codes, using &quot;forward sortation areas&quot; (FSAs), from A0A in Newfoundland to Y1A in Yukon.

Canada Post provides a postal code look-up tool on its website and via its mobile application, and sells hard-copy directories and CD-ROMs. Many vendors also sell validation tools, which allow customers to properly match addresses and postal codes. Hard-copy directories can also be consulted in all post offices, and some libraries.

In writing out the postal address for a location within Canada, the postal code follows the abbreviation for the province or territory.

==History==
===City postal zones===
Numbered postal zones were first used in Toronto in 1925. Mail to a Toronto address in zone 5 would be addressed in this format:

 37 Bloor Street West
 Toronto 5, Ontario

As of 1943, Toronto was divided into 14 zones, numbered from 1 to 15, except that 7 and 11 were unused, and there was a 2B zone.

Postal zones were implemented in Montreal in 1944.

By the early 1960s, other cities in Canada had been divided into postal zones, including Quebec, Ottawa, Winnipeg, and Vancouver as well as Toronto and Montreal. For example, an address in Vancouver would be addressed as:

 804 Robson Street
 Vancouver 1, B.C.

In the late 1960s, however, the Post Office began implementing a three-digit zone number scheme in major cities to replace existing one- and two-digit zone numbers, starting in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. For example, an address in Metropolitan Toronto would be addressed as:

 1253 Bay Street
 Toronto 185, Ontario

Toronto&#x27;s renumbering took effect 1 May 1969, accompanied by an advertising campaign under the slogan &quot;Your number is up&quot;. However, with impending plans for a national postal code system, then‍–‍Postmaster General Eric Kierans announced that the Post Office would begin cancelling the new three-digit city zone system. Companies had changed their mail addressing at their own expense, only to find that the new zoning would prove to be short-lived.
===Planning===
As the largest Canadian cities grew in the 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country&#x27;s postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and tens of billions of items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became progressively more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to sort the mail properly.

A report tabled in the House of Commons in 1969 dealt with the expected impact of &quot;environmental change&quot; on the Post Office operations over the following 25 years. A key recommendation was the &quot;establishment of a task force to determine the nature of the automation and mechanization the Post Office should adopt, which might include design of a postal code&quot;.

In December 1969, Communications Minister Eric Kierans announced that a six-character postal code would be introduced, superseding the three-digit zone system.
He later tabled a report in February 1970, entitled &quot;A Canadian Public Address Postal Coding System&quot;, submitted by the firm of Samson, Belair, Simpson, Riddell Inc.

===Implementation===
Canada was one of the last Western countries to implement a nationwide postal code system. The introduction of the postal code began with a test in Ottawa on 1 April 1971.
Coding of Ottawa was followed by a provincial-level rollout of the system in Manitoba, and the system was gradually implemented in the rest of the country from 1972 to 1974, although the nationwide use of the code by the end of 1974 was only 38.2 per cent.

The introduction of such a code system allowed Canada Post to easily speed up and simplify the flow of mail in the country, with sorting machines being able to handle 26,640 objects an hour.

The Canadian Union of Postal Workers objected to the automated sorting system, mainly because the wages for those who ran the new automated machines were much lower than for those who had hand-sorted mail.
The unions ended up staging job action and public information campaigns, with the message that they did not want people or businesses to use postal codes on their mail.
The union declared 20 March 1975 to be National &quot;Boycott the Postal Code&quot; Day, also demanding a reduction in the work week from 40 to 30 hours.
The boycott was called off in February 1976 after a new collective agreement was signed with the CUPW. 

One 1975 advertisement in the Toronto magazine &quot;Byliner&quot; generated controversy by showing a man writing a postal code on the bottom of a thonged woman with the following ditty: 
&quot;We&#x27;re not &#x27;stringing&#x27; you along,&lt;br&gt; Use postal codes – you&#x27;ll &#x27;thing&#x27; our &#x27;thong&#x27;,&lt;br&gt; Don&#x27;t be cheeky – you&#x27;ve all got &#x27;em&lt;br&gt; Please include them on the bottom.&quot; 
The advertisement was denounced as &quot;sexist garbage&quot; in the House of Commons by NDP MP John Rodriguez, prompting an apology from Postmaster General Bryce Mackasey.

==Components of a postal code==
===Forward sortation areas===
A &quot;forward sortation area&quot; (FSA) is a geographical region in which all postal codes start with the same three characters. The first letter of an FSA code denotes a particular &quot;postal district&quot;, which, outside Quebec and Ontario, corresponds to an entire province or territory.

The large populations of both Quebec and Ontario cause both provinces to be subdivided, into three and five postal districts respectively, and each has at least one urban area so populous that it has a dedicated postal district (&quot;H&quot; for the Montreal region, and &quot;M&quot; for Toronto). On the other hand, the low populations in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories (NWT) mean that even though Nunavut separated from the Northwest Territories and became its own territory in 1999, the two continue to share a postal district.

The digit identifies the FSA as urban or rural. A zero indicates a wide-area rural region (or, in rare instances, a special-purpose code); all other digits indicate urban areas. The second letter represents a specific rural region, an entire medium-sized city, or a section of a major metropolitan area. In the extreme case, some FSAs in downtown Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver are assigned to individual buildings. Rural FSAs also vary widely in population, with the Northwest Territories&#x27; &quot;X0G&quot; covering only the hamlet of Fort Liard, but adjoining &quot;X0E&quot; covering every other community in the territory except Yellowknife.

===Table of all postal codes===
A directory of FSAs is provided below, divided into separate articles by postal district. Individual FSA lists are in a tabular format, with the numbers (known as &quot;zones&quot;) going across the table and the second letter going down the table.

The FSA lists specify all communities covered by each rural FSA. Medium-sized cities may have one dedicated FSA; larger cities have more than one FSA within their limits.

For FSAs spanning more than one city, the city which is allocated the most codes in each such FSA is listed. For cities with a small number of FSAs (but more than one), the lists specify the relative location of each FSA in those cities. For cities with a large number of FSAs, applicable neighbourhoods and boroughs are specified.

All Canadian postal codes are listed in the following links, organized by first letter.







===Local delivery units===
The last three characters denote a &quot;local delivery unit&quot; (LDU). An LDU denotes a specific single address or range of addresses, which can correspond to an entire small town, a significant part of a medium-sized town, a single side of a city block in larger cities, a single large building or a portion of a very large one, a single (large) institution such as a university or a hospital, or a business that regularly receives large volumes of mail.

LDUs ending in zero correspond to postal facilities, from post offices and small franchised retail postal outlets all the way up to sortation plants. In urban areas, LDUs may be specific postal carriers&#x27; routes. In rural areas where direct door-to-door delivery is not available, an LDU can describe a set of post office boxes or a rural route. LDU &quot;9Z9&quot; is used exclusively for Business Reply Mail. In rural FSAs, the first two characters are usually assigned in alphanumerical order by the name of each community.

LDU &quot;9Z0&quot; refers to large regional distribution facilities, and is also used as a placeholder, appearing in some regional postmarks such as the &quot;K0H 9Z0&quot; which formerly appeared on purely local mail within the Kingston, Ontario, area.

==Number of possible postal codes==
Postal codes use twenty uppercase letters of the English alphabet; they do not include the letters D, F, I, O, Q, or U. The first position also does not make use of the letters W or Z. This means the maximum number of FSAs available is 18×10×20 = 3,600. With 10×20×10 = 2,000 possible LDUs in each FSA, there is a theoretical limit of 7.2million postal codes. The practical limit is a bit lower, as Canada Post reserves some FSAs for special functions, such as for test or promotional purposes (e.g., the H0H 0H0 for Santa Claus; see below), as well as for sorting mail bound for destinations outside Canada. The current Statistics Canada estimate of over 830,000 active postal codes represents about 12% of the entire postal code &quot;space&quot;, leaving ample room for expansion. There is less room with regard to FSAs, however; for example, as of 2024, only three FSAs remain unused in British Columbia: V3P, V4H, and V4J.

==Urbanization==
&quot;Urbanization&quot; is the name Canada Post uses to refer to the process where it replaces a rural postal code (a code with a zero as its second character) with urban postal codes. The vacated rural postal code can then be assigned to another community or retired. Canada Post decides when to urbanize a certain community after its population reaches a certain level, though different factors may also be involved.

For example, in early 2008, the postal code G0N 3M0 (covering Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier, Fossambault-sur-le-Lac, and Lac-Saint-Joseph, Quebec) was urbanized to postal codes beginning with G3N to remove ambiguities and confusions caused by similar street names. Unique among province-wide districts, New Brunswick (postal district E) is completely urbanized, its rural codes having been phased out.

==Santa Claus==
In 1974, staff at a Canada Post office in Montreal were noticing a considerable number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were being treated as undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters did not want the writers (mostly young children) to be disappointed at the lack of response, they started answering the letters themselves.

The amount of mail sent to Santa Claus increased every Christmas, to the point that Canada Post established an official Santa Claus letter-response program in 1983. By 2011, Santa&#x27;s mail was being handled with the assistance of 11,000 volunteers, mostly current or former postal workers, at multiple locations across Canada, devoting an average of 21 hours each to this seasonal task.

Approximately 1,000,000 letters are addressed to Santa Claus each Christmas, including some originating outside Canada, and all of them are answered in the same language in which they are written. Canada Post introduced a special address for mail to Santa Claus, complete with its own postal code:

 SANTA CLAUS
 NORTH POLE H0H 0H0
 CANADA

In French, Santa&#x27;s name translates as &quot;Father Christmas&quot;, and mail is addressed to:

 PÈRE NOËL
 PÔLE NORD H0H 0H0
 CANADA

The postal code H0H 0H0 was chosen for this special seasonal use, as it reads &quot;Ho ho ho&quot; if each zero is interpreted as the similar-looking letter O.

The H0- prefix is an anomaly: the 0 indicates a rural delivery zone, but H is used to designate Montreal, the second-largest city in Canada. As such, the H0- prefix is almost completely empty. H0M, assigned to the international Akwesasne tribal reserve on the Canada–US border, is the only other H0- postal code in active use.

In 2013, Santa was dragged into the ongoing Arctic sovereignty debate to support Canadian territorial claims extending to the North Pole. During a parliamentary debate, Conservative MP Paul Calandra accused the opposition Liberal Party of &quot;not think[ing] that the North Pole or Santa Claus [is] in Canada&quot;. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau responded by saying, &quot;Everyone knows that Santa Claus is Canadian. His postal code is H0H 0H0.&quot; The Official Opposition New Democratic Party disagreed, insisting that Santa is a &quot;citizen of the world&quot;.

==Transition points to the Canadian Forces Postal Service==
For transition of mail from the civilian to the Canadian Forces Postal Service, the postal codes of the three military post offices on Canadian soil are used, depending on the final destination.
* V9A 7N2 (BC): the Fleet Mail Offices (FMO) in Victoria
* B3K 5X5 (NS): FMO in Halifax
* K8N 5W6 (ON): the Canadian Forces Post Office (CFPO) in Belleville

These postal codes each represent a number of military post offices abroad, which are specified not by postal code but by CFPO or FMO number. The LDUs in this case correspond not so much to physical as to virtual delivery units, since mail is not delivered locally but is forwarded to the actual delivery points at Canadian military bases and ships abroad.

For example:

 Name
 Slot #
 PO Box 5053 Stn Forces
 Belleville ON K8N 5W6
 CANADA

In this example, Canada Post will deliver to the CFPO at Belleville, and the Canadian Forces Postal System will continue transport to the addressee at CFPO 5053 (in Geilenkirchen, Germany) by whatever means and timing the military will deem appropriate.

==Alternative uses==
Postal codes can be correlated with databased information from censuses or health registries to create a geographic profile of an area&#x27;s population. For instance, postal codes have been used to compare children&#x27;s risk of developing cancer.

As Canadian electoral districts frequently follow postal code areas, citizens can identify their local elected representative using their postal code. Provincial and federal government websites offer an online &quot;look-up&quot; feature based on postal codes. Although A1A 1A1 is sometimes displayed as a generic code for this purpose, it is actually a genuine postal code in use in the Lower Battery, St. John&#x27;s Harbour, Newfoundland. Another common &quot;example&quot; code in Canada Post materials, K1A 0B1, is the valid code for the Canada Post headquarters building in Ottawa.

<doc id="333328" wikidata="Q848781" url="?curid=333328" title="The Velvet Underground (album)">
<text>The Velvet Underground is the third studio album by the American rock band the Velvet Underground. Released in March 1969 by MGM Records, it was their first record with multi-instrumentalist Doug Yule, who replaced previous member John Cale. Recorded in 1968 at TTG Studios in Los Angeles, California, the album&#x27;s sound—consisting largely of ballads and straightforward rock songs—marked a notable shift in style from the band&#x27;s previous recordings. Lead vocalist Lou Reed intentionally did this as a result of their abrasive previous studio album &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; (1968). Reed wanted other band members to sing on the album; Yule contributed lead vocals to the opening track &quot;Candy Says&quot; and the closing track &quot;After Hours&quot; is sung by drummer Maureen Tucker.

Thematically, &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; discusses love, contrasting previous releases from the band. Reed devised its track order and based his songwriting upon relationships and religion. &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; has been hailed as one of his best love songs, although &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot; is noted for its experimentation in a call-back to &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;. Billy Name took the album&#x27;s photograph of the band sitting on a couch at Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory. The recording process started at short notice and while the band had a high morale, they were ultimately disappointed that Reed had created his own mix of the final product.

Contemporary reviews praised the album, which was a turning point for the band. Nevertheless, &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; failed to chart, again suffering from a lack of promotion by the band&#x27;s record label. Reed played a dominant role in the mixing process and his own mix of the album, dubbed the &quot;closet mix&quot;, was first released in the United States. MGM Director of Engineering Val Valentin was credited for a different mix which has been more widely distributed since then. Retrospective reviews have labeled it one of the greatest albums of the 1960s and of all time, with many critics noting its subdued production and personal lyrics. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 143 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background==
Cale was fired from the group in September 1968, and Yule was brought in as a bassist. Yule was discovered by Morrison through the band&#x27;s road manager Hans Onsager. Weeks after Yule joined the Velvet Underground, they began recording their third studio album. Lou Reed, the band&#x27;s principal songwriter, believed that the band should not &quot;make another &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;. I thought it would be a terrible mistake, and I really believed that. I thought we had to demonstrate the other side of us. Otherwise, we would become this one-dimensional thing, and that had to be avoided at all costs.&quot;

According to Morrison, earlier in 1968 a majority of the band&#x27;s equipment got stolen at JFK International Airport which influenced the album&#x27;s sound. However, Yule rejects this claim, explaining that he has no recollection of such an event, clarifying that the band was simply playing more melodically—Tucker also says this. Reed during this time had a growing taste for soothing music; in an interview with Lester Bangs he singled out tracks &quot;Jesus&quot; and &quot;Candy Says&quot;, declaring the latter &quot;probably the best song I&#x27;ve written...&quot; Reed considered &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; to be as far as the band could go with such production and additionally called each album the band made a chapter. They started recording after touring in the West Coast and band manager Steve Sesnick obtained studio time at a short notice, so the band had provided little time to prepare. At the time, Reed was managing relationships between his girlfriend Shelley Albin and Name, which influenced his songwriting.

==Recording==
&quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; was recorded during November and through December 1968 at TTG Studios in Los Angeles. The band stayed at the hotel Chateau Marmont and toured frequently while recording. They wrote and rehearsed at the hotel in the afternoon, recording songs at night. Reed and Morrison played 12-string guitars from Fender. Morale in the studio was generally high—Yule said that recording the album &quot;was a lot of fun. The sessions were constructive and happy and creative, everybody was working together&quot;. According to Yule, it took &quot;a couple of weeks for the basic tracks&quot;, additionally describing it as a &quot;studio live album&quot;. Reed intentionally tried to get Yule in the spotlight of it, and the band members suspected that this might have inflated his ego. Generally, the sessions had a happy atmosphere; Tucker said that she &quot;was pleased with the direction we were going and with the new calmness in the group, and thinking about a good future, hoping people would smarten up and some record company would take us on and do us justice.&quot;

&quot;The Murder Mystery&quot; includes all four members&#x27; voices. Yule states that the song was recorded in an MGM studio on Sixth Avenue in New York, though this contradicts the record&#x27;s liner notes. The album&#x27;s closing song, &quot;After Hours&quot;, has a rare solo lead vocal by Tucker, requested by Reed as he felt the sweet, innocent quality of her voice fitted the song&#x27;s mood better than his own. Tucker was nervous while recording the track, and after eight takes made everyone leave except herself, Reed, and the engineer. After she finished her take, she said that she wouldn&#x27;t sing it live unless someone requested it. Reed recorded multiple guitar solos for &quot;What Goes On&quot;; when the engineer commented on how they were running out of track space, the band ultimately decided to keep all of them, as Reed could not decide which one sounded better. When Reed did his own mix for the album—which drowned out other backing parts except his vocals—Morrison and Tucker were annoyed. Morrison described the final product as &quot;anti-production&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
The restraint and subtlety of the album was a significant departure from the direct abrasiveness of &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;. It reduced their previous effort&#x27;s explicit sexual references, horror, and references to drugs, replacing those with discussions of religion, love, and loneliness. Music critic Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; characterized it as folk rock, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Troy Carpenter said that it focused on mellow, melodic rock. According to music journalist Steve Taylor, &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; is a pop album because of its more accessible songs and &quot;has been called Lou Reed with a backing band due to the emphasis placed on songs rather than experimental sound work.&quot; Biographer Richie Unterberger commented on its dramatic shift in sound: &quot;Having made perhaps the loudest album of all time, it&#x27;s almost as if they&#x27;ve now decided to make the world&#x27;s quietest LP.&quot; Reed said that all of the songs on the album were in order and complement each other, elaborating in an interview with Howard Smith:
There were certain questions stated in the opening song... and then it was delineated, you know, through various phases... it ended with &#x27;Jesus,&#x27; saying now help me do this, man... And then after you went through all... from here to here, which is like what an average person goes through, you&#x27;re faced with like &#x27;The Murder Mystery,&#x27; which is a total reversal of everything. Because you shouldn&#x27;t be faced with that, but you were.

Just like on the other albums... people didn&#x27;t catch [the track order]. And on this one, I felt it was obvious. But maybe it wasn&#x27;t... And finally he sums up, he says, &#x27;That&#x27;s the Story of My Life.&#x27; But then he was faced with something else, which is once you get past you, you got you solved, so that you don&#x27;t exist... But what really is going on outside you is &#x27;The Murder Mystery... then after that, it was just kind of, well, &#x27;After Hours.&#x27; What could you say after &#x27;The Murder Mystery&#x27;? Except that &#x27;you close the door, the night could last forever.&#x27; Which is true.
Reed considered each song to be impersonal &quot;little plays&quot;. Apart from the forceful rockers &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;Beginning to See the Light&quot;, the album contains reflective, melodic songs that are about various forms of love, such as &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Some Kinda Love&quot;, &quot;Jesus&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Set Free&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s the Story of My Life&quot;. Reed and Morrison&#x27;s twin-guitar playing became the band&#x27;s most prominent sound, and the album had spare arrangements that lacked distortion. The only song that exhibited the band&#x27;s avant-garde roots is &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot;. The song took two sessions to record, and its poem was later included in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;.

===Side one===
Opening track &quot;Candy Says&quot; is based on transgender actress Candy Darling who was a member of Warhol&#x27;s Factory. Yule sings a tale of Darling, who hates her body and is in emotional pain. It references Darling&#x27;s thoughts by ambiguously stating &quot;I&#x27;ve come to hate my body/And all that it requires in this world&quot;. Darling reappears in Reed&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. Morrison says that the choice for Yule singing the song was because Reed was worn down by touring. Yule is backed by doo-wop-style harmonies and backing vocals. This was Yule&#x27;s first time singing in a studio, and the song was sung by Yule at Reed&#x27;s insistence.

&quot;What Goes On&quot; is upbeat and combines multiple lead guitar parts against an organ; this organ, played by Yule, is present in more songs on the record. Kory Grow of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Reed&#x27;s guitar solo on the song as &quot;bagpipe-y&quot;. Described as the &quot;anomaly&quot; of side one by Rob Jovanovic, it is complete with a &quot;twitchy beat&quot;, its sound as a result of Reed increasing the volume of his guitar during recording. R.C. Baker of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; labeled this song &quot;one of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&#x27;s greatest existential anthems&quot;.

&quot;Some Kinda Love&quot; contains salacious lyrics, contrasting the record, but it still has subdued elements—Tucker only uses a cowbell and bass drum. It ambiguously describes love, specifically religious love. Reed references &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; by T.S. Eliot. He writes about two characters, Tom and Marguerita, detailing a seductive conversation between them. Victor Bockris cites this as another example &quot;where [Reed] makes rock lyrics function as literature&quot;. Grow said that the song explains how love is uniform, while &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; simply discussed &quot;another kind of love&quot;, specifically adultery, according to Reed.

&quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; has been called one of Reed&#x27;s greatest love songs—Morrison singled it out from the album in a 1981 interview. The composition of it dates back to 1966; it had been performed live since mid-1966. It describes adultery and sinning as an extension of the album&#x27;s religious references. It was inspired by Reed&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Shelley Albin. According to Reed, he wrote it for someone he missed who had hazel eyes; it references &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot; and &quot;Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up To Me&quot; by Richard Fariña. Additionally, Sesnick speculates that some lines are about Cale&#x27;s firing. Tucker plays a tambourine. Reed praised Morrison&#x27;s guitar solo in the song:
It had that beautiful stutter in it. I could never do that. I always wondered how the hell he did that. But it was just the way he played – intuitive, but intuitive matched with brain.
According to Reed, &quot;Jesus&quot; has nothing to do with religion, though he described it as a search song. However, in the folk ballad, Reed asks Jesus for redemption in the form of a joyous sermon. Reed had little interest in religion; the message of the song is generally secular. During the course of the song Yule&#x27;s bass takes on a lead role in the instrumental backing.

===Side two===
&quot;Beginning to See the Light&quot; uses a phrase associated with religious redemption. In the song, Reed discusses his imagined revelation, and affirms his distinction of being loved, this time being described in relation to religion. He addresses the free love movement with the lines &quot;Here we go again/I thought you were my friend&quot;, later commenting &quot;How does it feel to be loved?&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m Set Free&quot; is ambiguous, though it salutes Phil Spector; the goodbyes at the end of the song imitate those in &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; by Spector&#x27;s band the Righteous Brothers. Unterberger praises the guitar solo of it as &quot;one of the group&#x27;s most tastefully underrated&quot;. In the song, Reed claims that he is free from a relationship, though he eventually discovers that this is untrue.

&quot;That&#x27;s the Story of My Life&quot; is minimal in instrumentation. Originally, Cale played viola for the song in live versions, though no viola was included for this studio version. During the song four lines of lyrics are repeated, and refer to Billy Name. The title and lyrics were inspired by a remark from Name, who introduced Reed to one of his largest influences, Alice Bailey. Bockris summarizes the theme of this song: &quot;The difference between right and wrong is the story of [Reed]&#x27;s life.&quot;

&quot;The Murder Mystery&quot; is a spoken word track. It incorporates a raga rhythm, murmuring organ, overlapping spoken-word passages, and lilting counterpoint vocals. During the verses, Lou Reed and guitarist Sterling Morrison recite different verses of poetry simultaneously, with the voices positioned strictly to the left and right. For the choruses, Tucker and Yule sing different lyrics and melodies at the same time, also separated left and right. Unterberger noted that it has &quot;little melody&quot;, and its narrative is repetitive, comparing it to &quot;78rpm and 16rpm records played simultaneously&quot;, the track closing with &quot;progressively crazed&quot; piano. Of the song, Reed referenced &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, elaborating that the song “is part of the novel that&#x27;s a murder mystery”. It was never performed live in its entirety—Morrison elaborated that it would be too hard to play. Jovanovic described it as an &quot;incomprehensible mix&quot; and homage to &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;; Reed labeled it as a failure, as he wanted &quot;one vocal to be saying the [lyrical] opposite of the other&quot;.

&quot;After Hours&quot; was the band&#x27;s only release at the time with Tucker singing lead vocals. She does not play percussion and is only backed by a guitar and bass. Tucker counts off by saying &quot;one, two, three&quot;; an older recording disk labeled the track &quot;If You Close the Door (Moe&#x27;s Song)&quot;. Generally, the song discusses intentional isolation.

==Cover artwork==
The cover was taken by Billy Name, photographer and archivist of Warhol&#x27;s Factory, featuring the band sitting sedately on a couch at The Factory. Name was paid 300 dollars for the photograph, which was the most he had been paid at the time for a picture. Yule and Tucker are looking at Reed, and Morrison is looking away—according to Tucker, this is because Reed was talking about the magazine cover. The back cover is a picture of Reed smoking, divided in two halves with one of them upside down, both only showing the left side of his face. Each side includes the track listing and credits for the record, which are also upside down in that part of the picture. Reed held an issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; which was airbrushed out. The cover artwork led to the record being dubbed &quot;The Grey Album&quot;.

==Release==
The release date of the band&#x27;s &quot;third album&quot; was given in a November 1968 article in &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; as January 1969; the full album was previewed by Danish magazine &quot;&quot; in January 1969. Phil Morris of MGM told &quot;Record World&quot; on February 22, 1969, that the album was ready for release. When the album was released in March 1969, the songwriting credits listed the entire band as its composer, even though Reed wrote all of its songs. Later releases would instead label Reed as the sole composer. The band switched from Verve Records to parent label MGM for unknown reasons—Sesnick says that the rock division of Verve was close to closing, while Morrison says that this simply was &quot;an administrative change&quot;. Ultimately, the decision to move to MGM was Sesnick&#x27;s.

Two mixes of the album were released. The initial mix is Reed&#x27;s which boosts his vocals and lowers its instruments, which was the first mix sold in the United States. Morrison noted that it sounds like it was recorded in a closet, which led to its label as the &quot;closet mix&quot;. Valentin produced a more conventional mix, which Yule would later say he was unaware of. The more widely distributed mix is the one credited to Valentin, which was distributed throughout Europe. The two versions use entirely different performances of &quot;Some Kinda Love&quot;, both taken from the same recording sessions. The closet mix was chosen for inclusion in the box set &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot;.

While Onsager didn&#x27;t plan on touring until after two commercially successful singles were released, their touring schedule remained nearly uninterrupted, and only one unsuccessful single was released. &quot;What Goes On&quot; was released in March 1969, with &quot;Jesus&quot; as its B side. MGM promoted it in a full-page advertisement in &quot;Cashbox&quot; but its distribution was heavily limited. The album suffered from lack of promotion, though a radio ad was used for WNEW-FM in New York, and MGM also listed advertisements in publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Creem&quot;, and the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. Ultimately it failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, the band&#x27;s first record to do so. Tucker attributed it to lack of promotion, while Yule noted how the album was ultimately not mainstream. Due to its failure to chart, MGM was not planning on releasing another album from the band.

==Critical reception==

Unterberger noted how &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; sounded far more commercial than any of the band&#x27;s previous albums and labeled it as the point where critical reception of the band became more positive. Despite this, however, the album failed to chart, and was less successful than the group&#x27;s previous two. Reviewing the album for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1969, Robert Christgau viewed it as the band&#x27;s best work and found it tuneful, well written, and exceptionally sung, despite &quot;another bummer experiment&quot; in &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot; and some &quot;mystery&quot; regarding the mix. In his ballot for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual critics poll, Christgau ranked it as the sixth best album of the year. He later included it in his &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

Lester Bangs, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, felt that it is not on-par with &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; and has missteps with &quot;The Murder Mystery&quot; and &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot;, but ultimately said that its combination of powerfully expressive music and profoundly sentimental lyrics will persuade the band&#x27;s detractors into believing they can &quot;write and play any kind of music they want to with equal brilliance.&quot; Paul Williams of &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; declared that &quot;everybody loves&quot; the band&#x27;s new release and labeled it his personal favorite since &quot;Forever Changes&quot; by Love. Bob Stark for &quot;Creem&quot; observed how it was &quot;as &#x27;far out&#x27; as either of the two [previous albums]&quot;. Lenny Kaye reviewed the record for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot;, labeling it &quot;almost lyrical in its beauty.&quot; Other newspapers such as &quot;Chicago Seed&quot;, &quot;Record World&quot;, &quot;Cashbox&quot;, and the more mainstream &quot;Variety&quot; praised the album, with the latter stating that it is &quot;an important contribution to the lyrical advancement of rock&quot;. Adrian Ribolla of &quot;Oz&quot;, however, lamented that the &quot;Velvet Underground don&#x27;t really sound together on this album&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Broadside&quot; from Massachusetts longed for the older sound of the band. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, while praising the album, simultaneously dismissed it by commenting it is &quot;not sensational, but interesting&quot;. Retrospectively in October 1969, Richard Williams of the same magazine elaborated that &quot;the old cruelty was still there&quot;, labeling the old &quot;Melody Maker&quot; review as erroneous and hailing the band&#x27;s first three albums as &quot;a body of work which is easily as impressive as any in rock&quot;.

==Reappraisal==

&quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; did not impact the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 until its 1985 reissue, when it reached No. 197. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2013, &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; has sold 201,000 copies since 1991, when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking record sales.

In a review of the album&#x27;s 1985 reissue, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Fricke remarked that both &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; and its predecessor lack the diverse range of the band&#x27;s 1967 debut album and the precise accessibility of &quot;Loaded&quot; (1970). However, he felt that the album is still edifying as a tender, subtly broad song cycle whose stark production surprisingly reveals the essence of Reed&#x27;s more expressive songwriting. Fricke cited the &quot;ironic pairing&quot; of &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; and &quot;Jesus&quot; as the best summary of &quot;the hopeful warmth at the center of the Velvets&#x27; rage.&quot;

Professional reviewers hailed the album&#x27;s subdued production. Colin Larkin, writing in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (1998), said that the album showcased a new subtlety because of Reed&#x27;s larger role in the band and that it &quot;unveiled a pastoral approach, gentler and more subdued, retaining the chilling, disquieting aura of previous releases.&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Rob Sheffield wrote that after Cale&#x27;s departure, the band became &quot;acoustic folkie balladeers&quot; and that Reed was unexpectedly charming on the album, whose &quot;every song is a classic&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine called the album &quot;a flickering, unforgettable band performance&quot;. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; highlighted Reed&#x27;s subdued contribution to the record, summarizing it as &quot;for the first time without John Cale, [Reed] creates quiet, impossibly beautiful folk-rock.&quot; Mark Deming for AllMusic wrote that the songs on the record are the most personal and moving that the band had recorded. Brian Eno declared it his favorite album from the band.

=== Rankings ===
&quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; was voted number 262 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2003, it was ranked number 314 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The 2012 edition saw it dropped to 316, and the 2020 edition moved it up to 143. &quot;NME&quot; magazine named it the 21st best album of all time in a list of the 100 Best Albums of All Time. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s 2017 list of the 200 best albums of the 1960s ranked it at number 12, above &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Ultimate Classic Rock listed it in its unranked Top 100 Albums of the 1960s. &quot;Uncut&quot; listed it at number 52 on its 200 Greatest Albums of All Time, above &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; by Big Star but behind &quot;Tapestry &quot;by Carole King.

Robert Dimery included the album in the 2018 edition of his book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==
Along with the group&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; received a reissue in 1985. These reissues were unexpectedly successful, which led to further releases under PolyGram such as &quot;Another View&quot;. The album was included in the box set &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot;, and would later be reissued as a Super Deluxe edition for its 45th anniversary, including mono versions of tracks, demos, and live performances.

<doc id="333333" wikidata="Q7997522" url="?curid=333333" title="Whole Earth Review">
<text>Whole Earth Review (Whole Earth after 1997) was a magazine which was founded in January 1985 after the merger of the &quot;Whole Earth Software Review&quot; (a supplement to the &quot;Whole Earth Software Catalog&quot;) and the &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot;. All of these periodicals are descendants of Stewart Brand&#x27;s &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;.

The last published hard copy issue of the magazine was the Winter 2002 issue. The next issue (Spring 2003) was planned but never published in hard copy format. Bruce Sterling attempted to solicit funds for this issue by writing that &quot;friends at &quot;Whole Earth Magazine&quot; have experienced a funding crunch so severe that the Spring 2003 special issue (#111) on Technological Singularity, edited by Alex Steffen of the Viridian curia, hasn&#x27;t been printed and distributed. &quot;Whole Earth&quot; is soliciting donations to get the issue printed, and has put some of the content online&quot;. Eventually, elements of the 2003 issue appeared only in digital format on the &quot;Whole Earth&quot; website.

==Overview==
Fred Turner discusses the creation of the &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot; in &quot;From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism&quot;. Turner notes that in 1983, &quot;The Whole Earth Software Catalog&quot; was proposed by John Brockman as a magazine which &quot;would do for computing what the original [&quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;] had done for the counterculture: identify and recommend the best &quot;tools&quot; as they emerged&quot;. The first issue was released in the Fall of 1984. &quot;The Whole Earth Software Catalog&quot; was a business failure, and was only published twice, with only three of &quot;The Whole Earth Software Review&quot; supplements published . At the same time, another Brand publication, &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; evolved out of the original &quot;Whole Earth Supplement&quot; in 1974. In 1985, Brand merged &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; with &quot;The Whole Earth Software Review&quot; to create the &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;.

This is also indicated in the issues themselves. Fall 1984, issue #43 is titled &quot;The Last CoEvolution Quarterly&quot;. The cover also states, &quot;Next issue is &#x27;Whole Earth Review&#x27;: livelier snake, new skin&quot;. In January 1985, issue #44 was titled &quot;Whole Earth Review: Tools and Ideas for the Computer Age&quot;. The cover also reads &quot;The continuation of &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Whole Earth Software Review&quot;&quot;. In an article titled &quot;Whole Earth Software Catalog Version 1.1&quot;, Stewart Brand states that there are three intended audiences for the new &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;: a) The audience of &quot;The Whole Earth Software Catalog&quot;, b) The audience of &quot;The Whole Earth Software Review&quot; and c) The audience of &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot;. The office of &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot; was next door to &quot;The WELL&quot;, another project that Stewart Brand and associates co-founded.

&quot;Whole Earth&quot; had a special role in promoting alternative technology or appropriate technology. In deciding to publish full-length articles on specific topics in natural sciences, invention, arts, etc., &quot;Whole Earth&quot; (like its predecessor, &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot;) was a journal aimed primarily at the educated layperson. The industrial designer and educator J. Baldwin served as the technology editor. Tool and book reviews were in abundance, and ecological and technology topics were interspersed with articles treating social and community subjects. One of the journal&#x27;s recurring themes was &quot;the commons&quot; (a thing, institution or geographic space of, or having to do with, the community as a whole), and the related &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;.

Stewart Brand and the later editors invited reviews of books and tools from experts in specific fields, to be approached as though they were writing a letter to a friend.

&quot;Whole Earth&quot; editors Kevin Kelly and Howard Rheingold both went on to edit other magazines.

<doc id="333335" wikidata="Q202857" url="?curid=333335" title="Jack Sparrow">
<text>Captain Jack Sparrow is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series and franchise. An early iteration of Sparrow was created by screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, but the final version of the character was created by actor Johnny Depp, who also portrayed him.

The Sparrow character is based on a combination of the Rolling Stones&#x27; guitarist Keith Richards and Looney Tunes cartoons, specifically the characters Bugs Bunny and Pepé Le Pew. He first appears in the 2003 film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. He appears in the later sequels &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006), &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007), &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; (2011), and &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017).

In the films, Sparrow is the pirate captain of the Black Pearl, and is later revealed to be one of the nine pirate lords in the Brethren Court, serving as the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean. The character is primarily defined as a trickster who can be treacherous and survives mostly by using wit, guile, and negotiation rather than force, opting to flee most dangerous situations and fight only when necessary.

Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain the Black Pearl from his mutinous first mate Hector Barbossa. After succeeding, he attempts to escape his blood debt to the legendary Davy Jones by finding the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest, as well as becoming embroiled in a war between the Brethren Court and the East India Trading Company. Later, when searching for the Fountain of Youth, he is abducted and taken aboard Blackbeard&#x27;s Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge. Sparrow is subsequently forced to lead Blackbeard to the Fountain while the shrunken Black Pearl is trapped in a bottle. In a later adventure, when the ghost Spanish Captain Armando Salazar pursues him, he searches for the Trident of Poseidon while also seeking to restore the Pearl to its original form.

When the Pirates of the Caribbean Disneyland ride was revamped in 2006, the Captain Jack Sparrow character was added. The character headlined the Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow attraction at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, and is the subject of spin-off novels, including a children&#x27;s book series, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow&quot;, which chronicles his childhood years. Depp&#x27;s performance in &quot;Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; earned him an Oscar nomination, and the character has gone on to become one of the most iconic in film history.

==Concept and creation==
===Character===
When writing the screenplay for &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio envisioned Captain Jack Sparrow as a supporting character in the vein of Bugs Bunny and Groucho Marx. The producers saw him as a young Burt Lancaster. Director Gore Verbinski admitted, &quot;The first film was a movie, and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn&#x27;t have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, and he kind of affects everybody else.&quot; Sparrow represents an ethical pirate, with Captain Barbossa as his corrupt foil, though both characters viewed as both light and dark tricksters. His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable or evil depends on the audience&#x27;s perspective. This acts as part of Will Turner&#x27;s arc, in which Sparrow tells him a pirate can be a good man, like his father.

Following the success of &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, the challenge to creating a sequel was, according to Verbinski, &quot;You don&#x27;t want just the Jack Sparrow movie. It&#x27;s like having a garlic milkshake. He&#x27;s the spice and you need a lot of straight men ... Let&#x27;s not give them too much Jack. It&#x27;s like too much dessert or too much of a good thing.&quot; Although &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; was written to propel the trilogy&#x27;s plot, Sparrow&#x27;s state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.

&quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; was meant to return it tonally to a character piece. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker, and now desires immortality. Sparrow struggles with what it takes to be a moral person, after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack&#x27;s hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of &quot;Jack Sparrows&quot; appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two &quot;Jacks&quot; constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won. By the end of &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expressed interest in a spin-off. Gore Verbinski concurred that &quot;all of the stories set in motion by the first film have been resolved. If there ever were another &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film, I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow.&quot;

&quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; was first announced on September 28, 2008, during a Disney event at the Kodak Theatre. Verbinski did not return to direct the fourth installment and was replaced by Rob Marshall. The movie uses elements from Tim Powers&#x27; novel of the same name, particularly Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth, but the film is not a straight adaptation of the novel.

The fifth film, &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, was co-directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg.

===Johnny Depp===

Looking to do a family film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 when he heard of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the possibility of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney&#x27;s reputation for soft children&#x27;s fare.

According to various reports and interviews, Johnny Depp prepared for the role while rehearsing in the steam room of a sauna. At times, he claimed to turn the heat up to its max temperature of 1,000 degrees. The actor was quoted as saying, &quot;Captain Jack was actually born in a sauna—my sauna. I figured this is a guy who has been on the high seas for probably all of his life, the majority of his life at least, and therefore probably dealt with a lot of inescapable heat to the brain.&quot; Depp also said, due to his daughter Lily-Rose Depp being three years old at the time, he watched various cartoons, using Tex Avery and Wile E. Coyote as examples.

At the first read-through, Depp surprised the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. He researched 18th-century pirates and, seeing parallels with modern rock stars, modeled his performance on Keith Richards. Richards later appeared in two cameos as Jack&#x27;s father, Captain Teague, in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; and &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;. Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because Orlando Bloom would play the traditional Errol Flynn-type character. Depp improvised the film&#x27;s final line, &quot;Now, bring me that horizon&quot;, which the writer called his favorite line. Disney executives were initially confused by Depp&#x27;s performance, questioning whether the character was drunk or gay. While watching the rushes, Disney CEO Michael Eisner proclaimed Depp was ruining the film. Depp&#x27;s response to Disney executives was they could trust him with his choices or let him go. Many industry insiders questioned Depp&#x27;s casting, as he was an unconventional actor not known for working within the traditional studio system.

Depp&#x27;s performance won acclaim from film critics. Alan Morrison found it &quot;Gloriously over-the-top ... In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it&#x27;s a master-class in comedy acting.&quot; Roger Ebert praised Depp for drawing away from the character as written and found Depp&#x27;s performance &quot;original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie ... his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal&quot;. Depp won a Screen Actor&#x27;s Guild award for his performance, and was nominated for a Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Actor, the first in his career. &quot;Film School Rejects&quot; argued the film made Depp as much a movie star as he was a character actor.

Depp&#x27;s return in &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; was the first time he had ever made a sequel. Drew McWeeny wrote, &quot;Remember how cool Han Solo was in &quot;Star Wars&quot; the first time you saw it? And then remember how much cooler he seemed when &quot;Empire&quot; came out? This is that big a jump.&quot; Depp received an MTV Movie Award and a Teen Choice Award for &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;, and was nominated for an Empire Award and another Golden Globe. For his performance in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, Depp won an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance, as well as a People&#x27;s Choice Award, a Kids&#x27; Choice Award, and another Teen Choice Award. He has signed on to reprise the role for future sequels.

===Make-up and costumes===

Depp wears a dreadlock wig in a rock-and-roll approach to a pirate aesthetic. He wears a red bandanna and numerous objects in his hair, influenced by Keith Richards&#x27; habit of collecting souvenirs from his travels; Sparrow&#x27;s decorations include his &quot;piece of eight&quot;. Sparrow wears kohl around his eyes, which was inspired by Depp&#x27;s study of nomads, whom he compared to pirates, and he wore contacts that acted as sunglasses. Sparrow has several gold teeth, two of which belong to Depp, although they were applied during filming. Depp initially forgot to have them removed after shooting &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, and wore them throughout the shooting of the sequels. Like all aspects of Depp&#x27;s performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp&#x27;s teeth. Sparrow wears his goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but the wires were abandoned because they made the braids stick up when Depp lay down. Sparrow has numerous tattoos, and has been branded a pirate on his right arm by Cutler Beckett, underneath a tattoo of a sparrow.

Depp collaborated with costume designer Penny Rose on his character&#x27;s appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow&#x27;s signature leather hat; to make Sparrow&#x27;s unique, the other characters did not wear leather hats. A rubber version was used for the scene in &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow&#x27;s sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.

Sparrow&#x27;s weapons are genuine 18th-century pieces: his sword dates to the 1740s and his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London. Depp used two pistols on set, one of rubber. Both survived production of the first film. Sparrow&#x27;s magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow added to the dial as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act like a normal compass, a magnet was used to make it spin. Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989 and the gold ring is a replica of a 2400-year-old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props to which Depp gave backstories: the gold-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced and the green dragon ring recalls his adventures in the Far East. Among Depp&#x27;s additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the Pelegosto prepare to eat him, and the sceptre was based on one a friend of Depp&#x27;s owned.

During the course of the films, Sparrow undergoes physical transformations. In &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones&#x27;s crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow&#x27;s distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old. In Dead Men Tell No Tales, a young Jack Sparrow appears during a flashback sequence.

==Fictional character biography==
===Before the films===
&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide&quot; gives a backstory to Jack Sparrow in which he was born on a pirate ship during a typhoon in the Indian Ocean and was trained to fence by an Italian.

Books following Jack Sparrow&#x27;s adventures before the events of the film include a twelve-book series focusing on his teenage years entitled &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow&quot;, and a five-books &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Legends of the Brethren Court&quot; series.
The 2017 film, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, features a flashback with how &quot;Jack the Sparrow&quot; meets the Spanish Navy Captain Armando Salazar. Sparrow was the helmsman aboard the &quot;Wicked Wench&quot;, a pirate ship which may or may not be the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, under the command of Captain Morgan, who was killed in battle. In the flashback, as reminisced upon by Salazar, the &quot;Silent Mary&quot; attacked pirate ships in battle until Captain Morgan died aboard the &quot;Wicked Wench&quot;, giving captaincy to young Sparrow. Sparrow outmaneuvers Salazar while being chased into the Devil&#x27;s Triangle, in which the crew of the &quot;Wicked Wench&quot; throw ropes around nearby reefs off the port side and use the rigging to slingshot the ship in the opposite direction. Jack steers the ship through the reef, saving the crew and the ship by changing the ship&#x27;s course at the last second. Afterward, on the deck of the &quot;Wicked Wench&quot;, the crew rewards Sparrow with &quot;tribute&quot; and bestows Jack with his famous hat and other personal effects.

Ann C. Crispin wrote the Disney Publishing novel titled &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom&quot;, published in 2011, which focuses more on the films&#x27; continuity rather than the other prequel books, and follows Jack&#x27;s adventures as a merchant captain for the East India Trading Company, which was hinted in &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, due to Crispin reading the screenplay, though the scenes were deleted from the final cut of the film. Jack Sparrow captained the merchant ship &quot;Wicked Wench&quot; for Cutler Beckett for about a year, hauling various cargoes, but he refused to haul slaves. Hoping to recruit Sparrow as one of his many &quot;operatives&quot;, Beckett indulged what he regarded as an odd peccadillo of Sparrow&#x27;s until he and the captain came to part ways. Beckett had dispatched Sparrow on a mission to find the lost island of Kerma, and the treasure at the heart of its underground labyrinth, but Sparrow double-crossed the EITC official and claimed he couldn&#x27;t locate the island. Suspicious that Sparrow had indeed found the island and the treasure, but had not given him its accurate location, Beckett determined to browbeat the captain into obedience and demanded that the young captain transport a cargo of slaves to the New World. Initially, Sparrow agreed, but when he realized that he was betraying the &quot;Wicked Wench&quot;, as well as himself, he rebelled and freed the slaves by taking them to Kerma for safe asylum. Furious that Sparrow had flouted his orders and stolen the &quot;cargo&quot; of &quot;black gold&quot;, Beckett had Sparrow thrown into jail. After allowing him to languish for a couple of months, Beckett had Sparrow transported to the &quot;Wicked Wench&quot;&#x27;s anchorage, about a mile from the coast of West Africa, near Calabar on the Bight of Benin. After personally branding Sparrow with the &quot;P&quot; brand (so he&#x27;d be forever identifiable as a pirate), Cutler Beckett gave the order to fire incendiary carcass charges at the &quot;Wicked Wench&quot;, to demoralize her captain. Sparrow fought his way free from his guards, dove overboard, and attempted to rescue his burning, foundering ship, but he was too late. The &quot;Wicked Wench&quot; turned into an inferno, then sank, taking Jack with her. But, while dying, Sparrow called upon Davy Jones, and struck a bargain with him: his soul and one hundred years of service aboard the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, in return for continued human existence of thirteen years as captain, plus saving the &quot;Wicked Wench&quot; and transforming her into the fastest, most dangerous pirate ship on the seven seas. Jones agreed and raised the ship from the sea floor, now a charred vessel with an angel figurehead. In keeping with her scorched appearance, Jack painted his ship black and added black sails, rechristening her &quot;the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;&quot;.

At some point, Hector Barbossa joins Jack Sparrow as his first mate. The original backstory was that Jack recruited Barbossa and his cronies prior to the voyage to Isla de Muerta. However, in the &quot;Legends of the Brethren Court&quot; book series, Hector Barbossa was Sparrow&#x27;s first mate in the quest for the Shadow Gold, where Tia Dalma tasks them with securing seven vials of shadow gold to stop the evil Shadow Lord from gaining total control over the seas by destroying the Brethren Court with his Shadow Army. Over the course of the novels, they are able to collect all vials shattered across the world by allying with or fighting against the other Pirate Lords. They are able to defeat the Shadow Lord with the combined efforts of all Pirate Lords, after which Jack wants to sail for Tortuga to recruit a new crew. Barbossa offers him to handle that in his stead, implying that he recruited men with the intent to mutiny against his captain.

Two years after his deal with Davy Jones, Jack Sparrow sailed the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and used his magical compass in search of the mysterious Isla de Muerta with a new crew, where the legendary Treasure of Cortés was hidden. Bootstrap Bill Turner was already a member of Jack&#x27;s crew, while the other crewmen, like Pintel and Ragetti, were recruited in Tortuga. Jack was also the one who told his first mate Hector Barbossa and the rest of the crew about the curse that was upon the treasure, though nobody believed this ghost story. Captain and crew agreed to equal shares of the treasure, but devious first mate Barbossa persuaded Jack that equal shares included knowing the treasure&#x27;s location. Jack complied, and soon after Barbossa led a mutiny and marooned Jack on an island with nothing but a pistol containing one shot. Although Jack was okay with Bootstrap Bill staying on board with Captain Barbossa, Jack hated Barbossa for having violated the Pirate&#x27;s Code. Jack was able to escape after three days on the island and began his pursuit of the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;. Within the next ten years, Jack learned of how Barbossa&#x27;s crew found the Aztec gold and became cursed, despite not believing in the curse placed on it, as well as how they are trying to get all the gold back and add their blood to the chest.

===Films===
====&quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;====

Captain Jack Sparrow first appears in &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003).

In his debut scene, Sparrow arrives in Port Royal, Jamaica on a sinking boat, seeking to commandeer a new ship. Despite rescuing Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann, from drowning, he is jailed for piracy. That night, a cursed pirate ship called the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; attacks Port Royal and Elizabeth is kidnapped. The &quot;Black Pearl&quot;″s captain, Hector Barbossa, desperately seeks one last gold coin to break an ancient Aztec curse that he and his crew are under. A blacksmith named Will Turner frees Sparrow to aid him in rescuing Elizabeth. They commandeer HMS &quot;Interceptor&quot; and recruit a motley crew in Tortuga, Haiti before heading to Isla de Muerta, where Elizabeth is held. Along the way, Will learns that Sparrow was the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;″s original captain until Barbossa led a mutiny ten years earlier and took over the ship, marooning Sparrow on an island to die. Sparrow tells Turner that his father was a pirate known as &quot;Bootstrap&quot; Bill Turner.

The rescue goes awry after Will betrays Sparrow, thinking Sparrow was going to betray him, and Barbossa later maroons Jack and Elizabeth on the same island upon which he had stranded Sparrow before. Elizabeth creates a signal fire from rum barrels and they are rescued by the Royal Navy. Sparrow cuts a deal with Commodore James Norrington to lead Norrington to the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;. Norrington refuses until Elizabeth, desperate to save Will, spontaneously accepts Norrington&#x27;s earlier marriage proposal. Right before the film&#x27;s climactic battle with the pirates at Isla de Muerta, Sparrow swipes a cursed coin from the treasure chest, making himself immortal and capable of dueling Barbossa. He shoots his nemesis with the pistol he has carried for ten years just as Will breaks the curse, killing Barbossa. Despite having assisted the Navy, Sparrow is sentenced to hang.

At Sparrow&#x27;s execution in Port Royal, Will saves Sparrow, but they are quickly captured. Elizabeth intervenes, declaring her love for Will who is pardoned, while Sparrow escapes by tumbling off a sea wall. The &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and her new crew arrive in time to retrieve him, and he becomes captain once more. Impressed by the wily pirate, Norrington allows him one day&#x27;s head start before giving chase.

====&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;====
A year following the events of the first film, Sparrow searches for the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest, which contains the heart of Davy Jones. Thirteen years prior to the events of the film, Sparrow made a bargain with Jones to raise the sunken &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and make Sparrow captain for thirteen years. Now the debt is due, and Bootstrap Bill Turner warns that Sparrow must either serve one hundred years aboard the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, or be dragged to Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker by the Kraken. Jack believes if he can find the Dead Man&#x27;s Chest, he can free his soul as well as control Jones and the seas.

Adding to Sparrow&#x27;s woes, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company has a personal score to settle and wants the chest himself. Beckett arrests Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, forcing Turner to search for Sparrow and his magic compass. Turner locates Sparrow&#x27;s crew on Pelegosto, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat Sparrow. They escape, and voyage to Tia Dalma (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with a jar of dirt – Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.

Sparrow strikes a new deal with Jones to deliver one hundred souls in exchange for his own. Jones agrees but keeps Turner as a &quot;good faith payment&quot;. Sparrow is recruiting sailors in Tortuga when he encounters Elizabeth Swann and James Norrington, the latter having succumbed to alcohol. Sparrow convinces Elizabeth that Turner can be freed by using the magic compass to find the chest. The duo head for Isla Cruces and find Will, who escaped Jones&#x27;s ship and has stolen the key to the Chest. Turner wants to stab Jones&#x27;s heart and free his father from Jones&#x27;s servitude, while Norrington plots to restore his career by delivering the heart to Beckett. Sparrow wants it to convince Jones to call off the Kraken.

Norrington escapes with the heart amid a battle with Jones&#x27;s crew, and Jones summons the Kraken. Realizing Sparrow is the target, Elizabeth traps him aboard the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; as the crew abandons the ship, and kisses him while she handcuffs him to the mast. Then, the monster devours Sparrow and drags the ship and his soul to Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker. The surviving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma who produces a captain she says can rescue Sparrow: a resurrected Hector Barbossa.

====&quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;====

Two months following the events of the second film, with Davy Jones&#x27;s heart in his possession and the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; under his command, Cutler Beckett begins exterminating all pirates. To combat Beckett, the nine pirate lords of the Brethren Court convene at Shipwreck Cove. Only Jack Sparrow is missing, killed and sent to Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker at the end of the previous film. Sparrow, as Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, must attend, as he did not bequeath to a designated heir his &quot;piece of eight&quot;, a pirate lord&#x27;s marker. The collective &quot;nine pieces of eight&quot; are needed to free sea goddess Calypso to defeat Beckett. With Elizabeth and Will, Barbossa leads Sparrow&#x27;s crew to Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker using stolen navigational charts from the pirate lord Sao Feng. After the crew locate him, Sparrow deciphers a clue on the charts allowing them to escape the Locker.

At the Brethren Court, Elizabeth has succeeded Captain Sao Feng as a Pirate Lord and is elected &quot;Pirate King&quot; after Sparrow breaks a stalemate vote. Sparrow is briefly reunited with his father, Captain Teague. During a parley with Beckett and Jones, Sparrow is traded for Turner, whom Jones and Beckett had captured. The &quot;Black Pearl&quot; battles the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; during a maelstrom created by Calypso, during which Sparrow fights Jones for the chest so that he may acquire Jones&#x27; heart to become immortal. When Jones mortally wounds Turner, Sparrow instead chooses to save Turner by helping him stab the heart, which kills Jones and makes Turner the &quot;Dutchman&quot;″s captain. Together, the &quot;Pearl&quot; and the &quot;Dutchman&quot; destroy Beckett&#x27;s ship. At the end, Barbossa again commandeers the &quot;Pearl&quot; and Sao Feng&#x27;s charts, stranding Sparrow and Gibbs in Tortuga. However, Sparrow had managed to cut out the navigational section of the charts and with them begins to search for the legendary Fountain of Youth.

====&quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;====
Prior to the events of the film, Jack Sparrow gained some renown as the pirate who knew and memorized the Fountain of Youth&#x27;s location. In the film, Joshamee Gibbs was put on trial in London until Sparrow himself arrived to rescue him as a disguised judge at the Old Bailey courthouse. However, they are captured at St James&#x27;s Palace. Jack is dragged into a forced audience with King George II, who wants Sparrow to guide an expedition to the Fountain. Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in the service to the British with a peg leg, reveals to Jack that he lost his leg and the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, which he believes to be sunk. Jack Sparrow escapes and crosses paths with a &quot;Jack Sparrow&quot; impostor, Angelica, a woman from Sparrow&#x27;s past and ruthless con artist. Angelica shanghais Jack aboard the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, the ship captained by Blackbeard.
Angelica tells Jack she is conning about being Blackbeard&#x27;s daughter, though later revealed she was telling the truth, and that Blackbeard wanting to find the Fountain to avoid a prophesied death. Although Jack incites a mutiny, saving the missionary named Philip Swift and fighting zombie officers, Blackbeard himself subdues the mutineers, using a sword that controls ships, a power that Jack&#x27;s crew of mutineers are unaware of. Blackbeard also practices voodoo magic and fashions a voodoo doll to bend Jack Sparrow to his will. Jack learns from Angelica that the ritual for the Fountain requires a mermaid&#x27;s tear and two silver chalices located on Ponce de León&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Santiago&quot;, and the person who drinks the water with the tear gets all the years of life from the other. Angelica also shows Jack Blackbeard&#x27;s collection of ships in bottles, including the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;. After capturing the mermaid Syrena at Whitecap Bay, Blackbeard sends Jack to get the chalices, taking his compass and threatening his own daughter at gunpoint. Aboard the &quot;Santiago&quot;, Jack meets Barbossa, but both find that the chalices have been taken by the Spanish. Before retrieving the chalices, Barbossa reveals his true agenda: revenge against Blackbeard for the attack on the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, which Barbossa truly believes to be sunk, which led to cutting off his leg via self-dismemberment. Jack returns to give Blackbeard the chalices in exchange for Angelica&#x27;s safety and Jack&#x27;s compass, which Jack sends Gibbs off with.

After locating the Fountain of Youth, a battle ensues until Angelica cuts her hand trying to remove Barbossa&#x27;s poisoned sword from Blackbeard&#x27;s chest. Jack receives the chalices from Syrena, who tells him to not waste her tear. Filling the chalices with the remaining drops of water from the Fountain, Jack tricks Blackbeard into drinking the chalice lacking the mermaid&#x27;s tear. Despite Blackbeard choosing to murder her so he can live, Angelica is mad at Jack about her father&#x27;s death. Acknowledging their feelings for one another, Jack maroons Angelica with on a small island named Sola Fide Beach, unsure if he can trust her. Angered, Angelica then uses the one shot from her pistol to kill Jack as he rows away, but misses. Jack reunites with Gibbs, who used Sparrow&#x27;s compass to locate and retrieved the shrunken &quot;Black Pearl&quot;. Though he has forfeited his opportunity for immortality, Sparrow tells Gibbs he&#x27;s settling for being famous as the one who found the Fountain of Youth and determined to continue living the pirate&#x27;s life. Following the film&#x27;s end credits, the Jack Sparrow voodoo doll drifted to the island that Angelica is marooned on.

====&quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;====
Prior to the events of the film, Jack Sparrow&#x27;s rival Hector Barbossa has become the richest and most powerful pirate of the seven seas, commanding a fleet of ten ships. Meanwhile, Jack has the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; still trapped in a bottle. Sparrow&#x27;s new ship the &quot;Dying Gull&quot; has never left berth, and his latest plans have met with failure.

Sparrow and his crew attempt to rob the new bank of St. Martin. The robbery is a success, but all the gold in it had fallen while they were dragging the locker, and Sparrow&#x27;s crew abandons him. Despondent, Jack trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass releases an old enemy, who holds a serious grudge against Sparrow; the ruthless ghostly pirate hunter Captain Armando Salazar. Years previously, Jack had defeated Salazar by tricking him into sailing his ship into the Devil&#x27;s Triangle, where Salazar and his crew were cursed to live as the undead. Salazar states that Jack perched in the ship&#x27;s rigging like a &quot;little bird&quot;, earning him the name &quot;Jack the Sparrow&quot;.

While in prison, Jack is contacted by Henry Turner, the son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who asks for aid in finding the Trident of Poseidon, as both are in need of its power to break curses related to the sea. The Trident could help save Sparrow from Salazar&#x27;s revenge and free Will from the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. Remembering Will and Elizabeth, expressing some hesitation, Jack agrees. The next day, Sparrow is sentenced to be executed by guillotine (by Jack&#x27;s accidental choosing), but is rescued by his crew. Aided by aspiring astronomer Carina, Jack and Henry attempt to locate the Trident of Poseidon. Barbossa releases the &quot;Pearl&quot; from its bottle, giving them a chance to outrun Salazar. Jack and Barbossa discuss the fact that Carina is Hector&#x27;s long-lost daughter, whom he had left at an orphanage in order to give her a chance for a better life. Jack attempts to use the secret to blackmail Barbossa, but fails.

They are able to track the Trident to its resting place. Though Salazar nearly kills Jack, they are able to destroy the Trident. With the destruction of the Trident, Salazar and his crew become mortal again. Jack, Henry and Carina escape as Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar. Despite their differences, Jack mourns Barbossa&#x27;s death. Later, Jack watches Will and Elizabeth&#x27;s reunion before he departs, sailing with the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and his compass once again in his possession.

According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster who uses wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end disputes verbally instead of by force. He walks with a slightly drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship &quot;Interceptor&quot;, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: &quot;That&#x27;s got to be the best pirate I have ever seen&quot;. Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: &quot;So it would seem&quot;, in sharp contrast to his earlier assertion: &quot;You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of&quot;. In the third film, while Sparrow leaves Beckett&#x27;s ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks: &quot;Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?&quot; Jack also tricks Blackbeard into saving his daughter by switching places the two chalices required to use the fountain of youth.

Though a skilled swordsman, Sparrow prefers to use his superior intelligence during combat, exploiting his environment to turn the tables on his foes, reasoning &quot;Why fight when you can negotiate?&quot; and using non-violent negotiation to turn his enemies against each other. He invokes parleys and tempts his enemies away from their murderous intentions, encouraging them to see the bigger picture, as when he persuades Barbossa to delay returning to mortal form so he can battle the Royal Navy. He often uses complex wordplay and vocabulary to confound his enemies, and it is suggested that his pacifism may be one reason Barbossa and the crew of the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; mutinied.
The character is portrayed as having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made of hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow&quot; bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as &quot;Captain&quot; and often gives the farewell, &quot;This is the day you will always remember as the day that you &quot;almost&quot; caught Captain Jack Sparrow!&quot; which proclamation is sometimes humorously cut short. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, &quot;But you &quot;have&quot; heard of me.&quot; In a deleted scene from &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; Sparrow ponders being &quot;the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow&quot;, and during &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot; he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns it can be a terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being &quot;Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate,&quot; as the East India Trading Company purges piracy. The topic of immortality is brought up again during &quot;On Stranger Tides,&quot; when Jack says &quot;But better to not know which moment may be your last, every morsel of your entire being alive to the infinite mystery of it all&quot;.

Despite his many heroics, Sparrow is a pirate and a morally ambiguous character. When agreeing to trade 100 souls, including Will, to Davy Jones in exchange for his freedom, Jones asks Sparrow whether he can &quot;condemn an innocent man—a &quot;friend&quot;—to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?&quot; After a hesitation Sparrow merrily replies, &quot;Yep! I&#x27;m good with it!&quot; He carelessly runs up debts with Anamaria, Davy Jones, and the other pirate lords. Sao Feng, pirate lord of Singapore, is particularly hateful towards him. In a cowardly moment, Sparrow abandons his crew during the Kraken&#x27;s attack, but underlying loyalty and morality compel him to return and save them. Sparrow claims to be a man of his word, and expresses surprise that people doubt his truthfulness. There is no murder on his criminal record. He is shown to genuinely care about his allies and even people he doesn&#x27;t know. He genuinely cared for Angelica, and even admits to her at the end of the film that he does love her, and even saves Phillip Swift, a missionary trapped on Blackbeard&#x27;s ship whom he had never met before.

Depp partly based the character on Pepé Le Pew, a womanizing skunk from &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;. Sparrow claims to have a &quot;tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature,&quot; although his conquests are often left with a sour memory of him. Former flames, Scarlett and Giselle, usually slap him or anyone looking for him. Likewise, Angelica claims that Jack &quot;seduced her and used her&quot;. His witty charm easily attracts women, and even has Elizabeth questioning her feelings. Verbinski noted phallic connotations in Sparrow&#x27;s relationship with his vessel, as he grips the ship&#x27;s wheel. The &quot;Black Pearl&quot; is described as &quot;the only ship which can outrun the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;&quot;. The Freudian overtones continue in the third film when Sparrow and Barbossa battle for captaincy of the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, showing off the length of their telescopes, and in a deleted scene, they fight over the steering wheel. Sparrow claims his &quot;first and only love is the sea,&quot; and describes his ship as representing freedom. Davy Jones&#x27;s Locker is represented as a desert, symbolizing his personal hell.

According to writer Giles Milton, Jack Sparrow was inspired by the seventeenth-century English pirate Jack Ward. He was also based on Long John Silver as portrayed in the 1950 Disney Treasure Island adaptation.

==Reception and impact on pop culture==
When &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; grossed over worldwide, Ian Nathan attributed this to Sparrow&#x27;s popularity: &quot;&quot;Pirates&quot;, the franchise, only had to turn up. There was a powerful holdover from the cheeky delights of its debut, something we hadn&#x27;t felt since the Clone Wars called it a day.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; in 2006 declared Depp&#x27;s performance the seventy-fourth &quot;thing that rocked our world&quot; and later named him the eighth greatest movie character of all time. In 2015, a new poll of the 100 greatest film characters of all time placed him as the fourteenth greatest. A survey of more than 3,000 people showed Jack Sparrow was the most popular Halloween costume of 2006, and a 2007 poll held by the Internet Movie Database showed Sparrow to be the second most popular live action hero after Indiana Jones. In a 2007 Pearl &amp; Dean poll, Jack Sparrow was listed as Depp&#x27;s most popular performance.

Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is the only element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character&#x27;s popularity can be attributed to his being a &quot;scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in&quot;. Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow&#x27;s popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow&#x27;s personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by &quot;IGN&quot; as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he &quot;lives for himself and the freedom to do whatever it is that he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp&#x27;s swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade.&quot; In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years&quot;. In the May 2012 Greek elections, a voter gained media coverage when he &quot;voted&quot; for Jack Sparrow by writing his name on the Pirate Party of Greece ballot.

An internet hoax about a reality program on the now-defunct Quibi platform called &quot;Jack Sparrow House&quot; gained traction in the early 2020s. The program supposedly featured fourteen Jack Sparrow impersonators living in a house together, with them being eliminated if they broke character. The hoax included a detailed Wikipedia article, which was eventually deleted. Snopes said that comedian Rory Strahan-Mauk was behind it, and that a photo claiming to be of the contestants were actually fans attending the Tokyo premiere of &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;.

==In other media==
Jack Sparrow appears in video games and books spun off the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; media franchise. Some notable &quot;Pirates&quot; video games in which Jack Sparrow appears as a playable character in include &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow&quot;, voiced by Johnny Depp, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, voiced by Jared Butler, and &quot;Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game&quot;, with archive audio of Johnny Depp&#x27;s vocal effects. Jack was one of the first playable characters in the &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; series, where he is reprised by Jared Butler. He also appears in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, first in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, where he is voiced by James Arnold Taylor, and again in 2019&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, reprised again by Butler. In the &quot;A Pirate&#x27;s Life&quot; expansion for the video game &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot; he is voiced again by Butler. Jack Sparrow also appears as playable character in &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;,&quot; Disney Heroes: Battle Mode&quot;, and &quot;Disney Speedstorm&quot;. A purchasable cosmetic outfit of Jack Sparrow was added to &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; on July 19, 2024, as part of the Cursed Sails Event Pass. Jack also appears in &quot;Disney Speedstorm&quot;.

In 2011, comedy group the Lonely Island, in collaboration with Michael Bolton, released a song named for Jack.

In July 2022, Depp portrayed a parody of Sparrow, Phillip Artoosh, in &quot;Adventurer&#x27;s Game&quot;, a promotional short film for the mobile game &quot;Sea of Dawn&quot;.

<doc id="333341" wikidata="Q971994" url="?curid=333341" title="Stewart Brand">
<text>Stewart Brand (born December 14, 1938) is an American project developer and writer, best known as the co-founder and editor of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;. He has founded a number of organizations, including the WELL, the Global Business Network, and the Long Now Foundation. He is the author of several books, most recently &quot;Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto&quot;.

==Life==
Brand was born in Rockford, Illinois, and attended Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. He studied biology at Stanford University, graduating in 1960. As a soldier in the U.S. Army, he was a parachutist and taught infantry skills; he later expressed the view that his experience in the military had fostered his competence in organizing. A civilian again in 1962, he studied design at San Francisco Art Institute, photography at San Francisco State College, and participated in a legitimate scientific study of then-legal LSD with Myron Stolaroff&#x27;s International Foundation for Advanced Study, in Menlo Park, California. In 1966, he married mathematician Lois Jennings, an Ottawa Native American.

Brand has lived in California since the 1960s. He and his second wife live on &quot;Mirene&quot;, a -long working tugboat. Built in 1912, the boat is moored in a former shipyard in Sausalito, California. He works in &quot;Mary Heartline&quot;, a grounded fishing boat about 100 yards (90 metres) away. One of his favorite items is a table on which Otis Redding is said to have written &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; (Brand acquired it from an antiques dealer in Sausalito).

==USCO and Merry Pranksters==
By the mid-1960s, Brand became associated with New York multimedia group USCO and Bay Area author Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters. Brand co-produced the 1966 Trips Festival, an early effort blending rock music and light shows, with Kesey and Ramón Sender Barayón. The Trips Festival was among the first Grateful Dead performances in San Francisco. An estimated 10,000 hippies attended, and Haight-Ashbury soon emerged as the epicenter of an emerging counterculture, with the Summer of Love in 1967. Tom Wolfe includes Brand in his 1968 book &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;.

==NASA images of Earth==


In 1966, while on an LSD trip on the roof of his house in North Beach, San Francisco, Brand became convinced that seeing an image of the whole Earth would change how we think about the planet and ourselves. He then campaigned to have NASA release the then-rumored satellite image of the entire Earth as seen from space. He sold and distributed buttons for 25 cents each, asking, &quot;Why haven&#x27;t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?&quot; During this campaign, Brand met Richard Buckminster Fuller, who offered to help Brand with his projects. In 1967, a satellite, ATS-3, took the photo. Brand thought the image of our planet would be a powerful symbol; it adorned the first (Fall 1968) edition of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;. Later in 1968, NASA astronaut Bill Anders took an Earth photo, &quot;Earthrise&quot;, from Moon orbit, which became the front image of the spring 1969 edition of the &quot;Catalog&quot;. 1970 saw the first celebration of Earth Day. During a 2003 interview, Brand explained that the image &quot;gave the sense that Earth&#x27;s an island, surrounded by a lot of inhospitable space. And it&#x27;s so graphic, this little blue, white, green and brown jewel-like icon amongst a quite featureless black vacuum.&quot;

==Douglas Engelbart==
In late 1968, Brand assisted electrical engineer Douglas Engelbart with the Mother of All Demos, a presentation of many revolutionary computer technologies (including hypertext, email, and the mouse) to the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco.

Brand surmised that given the necessary consciousness, information, and tools, human beings could reshape the world they had made (and were making) for themselves into something environmentally and socially sustainable.

==&quot;Whole Earth Catalog &quot;==
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, about 10 million Americans were involved in living communally. In 1968, using the most basic approaches to typesetting and page layout, Brand and his colleagues created issue number one of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, employing the subtitle &quot;access to tools&quot;. Brand had benefited from the mentorship of alternative-education enthusiast Dick Raymond, whose personal project, the Portola Institute, provided financial support for Brand&#x27;s brainchild. Until 1980, editions of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; were published by the Portola Institute. Brand and his wife, Lois, traveled to communes in a 1963 Dodge truck known as the &quot;Whole Earth Truck Store&quot;, which moved to a storefront in Menlo Park, California. That first oversized &quot;Catalog&quot;, and its successors in the 1970s and later, reckoned a wide assortment of things could serve as useful &quot;tools&quot;: books, maps, garden implements, specialized clothing, carpenters&#x27; and masons&#x27; tools, forestry gear, tents, welding equipment, professional journals, early synthesizers, and personal computers. Brand invited &quot;reviews&quot; (written in the form of a letter to a friend) of the best of these items from experts in specific fields. The information also described where these things could be located or purchased. The &quot;Catalog&quot;″s publication coincided with the great wave of social and cultural experimentation, convention-breaking, and &quot;do it yourself&quot; attitude associated with the &quot;counterculture&quot;.

The &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; had widespread influence within the rural back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s, and the communities movement within many cities throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia. The 1972 edition sold 1.5 million copies, winning the first U.S. National Book Award in the Contemporary Affairs category.

Steve Jobs ended his 2005 commencement address at Stanford University by acknowledging both Stewart Brand and the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, quoting its farewell message: &quot;Stay hungry. Stay foolish&quot;.

==&quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot;==
To continue this work and also to publish full-length articles on specific topics in the natural sciences and invention, in numerous areas of the arts and the social sciences, and on the contemporary scene in general, Brand founded &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; in 1974, aimed primarily at educated laypeople. Brand never better revealed his opinions and reason for hope than when he ran, in &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; #4, a transcription of technology historian Lewis Mumford&#x27;s talk &quot;The Next Transformation of Man&quot;, in which he stated that &quot;man has still within him sufficient resources to alter the direction of modern civilization, for we then need no longer regard man as the passive victim of his own irreversible technological development&quot;.

The content of &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; often included futurism or risqué topics. Besides giving space to unknown writers with something to say, Brand presented articles by many respected authors and thinkers, including Mumford, Howard T. Odum, Witold Rybczynski, Karl Hess, Orville Schell, Ivan Illich, Wendell Berry, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gregory Bateson, Amory Lovins, Hazel Henderson, Gary Snyder, Lynn Margulis, Eric Drexler, Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill, Peter Calthorpe, Sim Van der Ryn, Paul Hawken, John Todd, Kevin Kelly, and Donella Meadows. In the ensuing years, Brand authored and edited a number of books on topics as diverse as computer-based media, the life history of buildings, and ideas about space colonies.

He founded the &quot;Whole Earth Software Review&quot;, a supplement to the &quot;Whole Earth Software Catalog,&quot; in 1984. It merged with &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; to form the &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot; in 1985.

==California government==
From 1977 to 1979, Brand served as &quot;special advisor&quot; to the administration of California Governor Jerry Brown.

==The WELL==
In 1985, Brand and Larry Brilliant founded the WELL (&quot;Whole Earth &#x27;Lectronic Link&quot;), a prototypical, wide-ranging online community for informed participants the world over. The WELL won the 1990 Best Online Publication Award from the Computer Press Association.

==All Species Foundation==
In 2000, Brand helped launch the All Species Foundation, which aimed to catalog all species of life on Earth. The project ceased functioning in 2007, transferring its mission to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Life&quot;.

==Global Business Network==

During 1986, Brand was a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab. Soon after, he became a private-conference organizer for such corporations as Royal Dutch Shell, Volvo, and AT&amp;T. In 1988, he became a co‑founder of the Global Business Network, which became involved with the evolution and application of scenario thinking, planning, and complementary strategic tools. For fourteen years, Brand was on the board of the Santa Fe Institute (founded in 1984), an organization devoted to &quot;fostering a multidisciplinary scientific research community pursuing frontier science&quot;. He has also continued to promote the preservation of tracts of wilderness.

==&quot;Whole Earth Discipline&quot;==
The &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; implied an ideal of human progress that depended on decentralized, personal, and liberating technological development—so‑called &quot;soft technology&quot;. However, in 2005, Brand criticized aspects of the international environmental ideology he had helped to develop. He wrote an article called &quot;Environmental Heresies&quot; in the May 2005 issue of the MIT &quot;Technology Review&quot;, in which he described what he considered necessary changes to environmentalism. He suggested, among other things, that environmentalists embrace nuclear power and genetically modified organisms as technologies with more promise than risk.

Brand later developed these ideas into a book and published &quot;Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto&quot; in 2009. The book examines how urbanization, nuclear power, genetic engineering, geoengineering, and wildlife restoration can be used as powerful tools in humanity&#x27;s ongoing fight against global warming.

In a 2019 interview, Brand described his perspective as &quot;post-libertarian&quot;, indicating that at the time when the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; was being written, he did not fully understand the significance of the role of government in the development of technology and engineering. In his environmental position, he self-describes as an &quot;eco-pragmatist&quot;.

==Long Now Foundation==
Brand is co‑chair and president of the board of directors of the Long Now Foundation and chairs the foundation&#x27;s Seminars About Long-term Thinking. This series on long-term thinking has presented a range of speakers, including Brian Eno, Neal Stephenson, Vernor Vinge, Philip Rosedale, Jimmy Wales, Kevin Kelly, Clay Shirky, Ray Kurzweil, Bruce Sterling, and Cory Doctorow. The Long Now Foundation has worked with Jeff Bezos to build the 10,000 Year Clock. 

Brand is the subject of the 2021 documentary film &quot;We Are As Gods&quot;.

<doc id="333353" wikidata="Q4659398" url="?curid=333353" title="A Selection of Hymns for Public Worship">
<text>A Selection of Hymns for Public Worship is a hymn book compiled by William Gadsby, a minister of the Gospel Standard Strict Baptists in England. First published in the 19th century, it is still in current use.

==History==

William Gadsby, a Strict and Particular Baptist minister, first published his selection of hymns in 1814 in Manchester, printed at the printing works owned by his son John Gadsby. William Gadsby published a later edition in 1838. After his death a further enlarged edition was published including a second supplement selected by J C Philpot, another Strict Baptist Minister. It was written to counteract what Gadsby believed to be Arminian and legalistic tendencies in some of Isaac Watts&#x27; &quot;Psalms and Hymns&quot;. Nevertheless, Gadsby&#x27;s Selection of Hymns does include many hymns by Isaac Watts.

==Contents==

This hymnal contains 1156 hymns (words only) by various authors. These are primarily, but not exclusively, from the Calvinistic stream of Protestant thought.

===Authors===

The edition currently available includes the following authors, here listed by number of hymns used.
Joseph Hart (219); William Gadsby (173); Isaac Watts (145) John Berridge (72); John Newton (63) John Kent (51); Charles Wesley (41); Thomas Kelly (34); Samuel Medley (31); Anne Steele (27); Augustus M. Toplady (24); Richard Burnham (22); Henry Fowler (20); William Cowper (18); Joseph Swain (18); Daniel Herbert (12); Benjamin Beddome (10); John Fawcett (10); William Hammond (10); John Stevens (9); John Adams (9); Phillip Doddridge (8); John Cennick (6).

There are other authors with fewer hymns in this book, as well as eight anonymous contributions.

===Examples of Gadsby&#x27;s own writing===

Gadsby&#x27;s own hymns are of a high standard. For example, number 667 is worthy of Watts and Charles Wesley, both highly regarded for their hymn writing abilities.

&quot;He saves from death, destruction, and despair.&quot;

&quot;2 He is my Refuge in each deep distress;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The Lord my strength &amp; glorious righteousness;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Through floods and flames he leads me safely on,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;And daily makes his sovereign goodness known.&quot;

&quot;3 My every need he richly will supply;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Nor will his mercy ever let me die;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;In him there dwells a treasure all divine,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;And matchless grace has made that treasure mine.&quot;

&quot;4 O that my soul could love and praise him more,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;His beauties trace, his majesty adore;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Live near his heart, upon his bosom lean;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Obey his voice, and all his will esteem.&quot;

The third line of the last verse certainly echoes the thought of Charles Wesley&#x27;s hymn &quot;Thou Shepherd of Israel, and mine&quot;, with the line &quot;Eternally held in Thy heart&quot;.

Another example from William Gadsby illustrates the Calvinistic flavour of this book. Hymn number 530 describes election in Calvinistic language.

&quot;1 ELECTION is a truth divine,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;As absolute as free;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Works ne&#x27;er can make the blessing mine;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; &#x27;Tis God&#x27;s own wise decree.&quot;

&quot;5 Nor law, nor death, nor hell, nor sin,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Can alter his decree;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The elect eternal life shall win,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;And all God&#x27;s glory see.&quot;

==Availability==

The hymnal is currently available in these editions : &quot;Buckram&quot; (standard pew edition), 936p., ; Large print version, 636p., ; Large print (leather), 936p., ,; leather binding and India paper, 895 pp.; hardback, 895 pp.; and a Kivar edition, 473 pp.

The hymn book is used by the Gospel Standard Strict Baptists in England and the United States and a few Old School or Primitive Baptist churches in the United States. Many of the Strict Baptists use the Companion Tune Book, a musical score of 1011 hymn tunes designed as a companion to Gadsby&#x27;s hymn book. The hymn book was never widely used in churches outside the United Kingdom, but there is some renewed interest in it among Reformed Baptists as devotional poetry.

Gadsby also published &quot;Nazarene&#x27;s Songs&quot;, containing about 250 of his own hymns.

<doc id="333354" wikidata="Q18502" url="?curid=333354" title="Northern Premier League">
<text>The Northern Premier League is an English football league that was founded in 1968. Together with the Isthmian League and the Southern League it forms levels seven and eight of the English football league system.

Geographically, the league covers all of Northern England and the northern, central areas of the Midlands, and western parts of East Anglia. Originally a single-division competition, a second division was added in 1987: Division One, and in 2007 a third was added when Division One split into two geographic sections - Division One North and Division One South. In 2018 Division One was re-aligned as East and West Divisions, then North West and South East in 2019. In 2021, the FA restructured the non-League football pyramid and created Division One East, West, and Midlands.

Successful teams at the top of the NPL Premier Division are promoted to level 6 of the pyramid (either National League North or National League South), and at the bottom end of the competition, teams are relegated down to level 9, where several regional feeder leagues promote clubs into the league.

==History==
The Northern Premier League (NPL) was founded in 1968, as the northern equivalent of the Southern League, decades after the other two leagues at what is now the seventh tier of the English football league system, the Isthmian League and the Southern League. At that time they were the highest level non-League division below the English Football League, the same level as the other league in Northern England, the Northern League.

Over the next two decades, the NPL successfully displaced its older rival to become the pre-eminent regional competition in Northern England, with the Northern League eventually forced to accept status as feeder league to the NPL. In 1979, upon the creation of the Alliance Premier League (which later became the Conference and is now the National League), the NPL became a feeder league and fell down one level in the English football league system, and with the then-Conference&#x27;s addition of regional divisions in 2004 the NPL was demoted by a further tier and there are now two levels between it and the English Football League.

From 1992–93 to 1994–95 the league&#x27;s Division One included two non-English clubs, Caernarfon Town from Wales and Gretna from Scotland, who later joined their countries&#x27; league systems. Colwyn Bay, Bangor City, Newtown, and Rhyl have also played in the league.

In 2018, the NPL&#x27;s member clubs voted 37–27, with one abstention and three clubs&#x27; absence, to split Step 4 (level 8) divisions from east to west starting from the 2018–19 season, and one year later, the league published its successful bid to add another division at Step 4 initially in 2020, further altering Division One into northwest and southeast for travel reasons. After the Football Association (FA) deferred its implementation of changes to the NLS, the NPL&#x27;s additional division was created in 2021 instead.

*1968–69 to 1986–87: Premier Division

===Sponsorship===
Owing to title sponsorship deals, the league has been billed under various names, including a sixteen-year spell as the Unibond League, the longest such deal in world football. 
When this deal ended in 2010, a new deal was announced which saw the competition billed as the Evo-Stik League until the 2017–18 season.
The League announced on 8 July 2019 that a two-year deal for seasons 2019-20 and 2020-21 had been agreed with new sponsor BetVictor. This sponsorship agreement with BetVictor was subsequently terminated early in April 2020 with a replacement, Entain&#x27;s Pitching In, announced as the next sponsor for 2020–21. At the time of announcement, Entain went by its former name GVC Holdings. Under this partnership, the NPL is marketed as one of the three Trident Leagues, alongside its Isthmian and Southern counterparts.

==Structure==
Since 2021, the NPL has had four divisions: the Premier Division, Division One Midlands, Division One West and Division One East. Prior to 2007 there was just a single Division One, and from 2018 to 2021 Division One was arranged on a north-south, then east-west basis. 

The Premier Division has 22 clubs, with the champions promoted to the National League along with the winners of a playoff between the second to fifth place clubs. Theoretically, clubs from the NPL could be promoted into either of the National League&#x27;s two regional divisions, but the geographical footprint of the NPL has never overlapped with that of the National League South, so (as of 2015) all promoted NPL clubs have been placed in the National League North. The bottom three teams are usually relegated to Division One North West or South East, but NPL Premier Division clubs in the most southerly locales could be relegated to the Southern League Division One Central.

From the 2019–20 season, Division One North West and South East have 20 clubs each. In each division, the champions are promoted to the Premier Division, along with the winners of a divisional playoff. The bottom two clubs in each division are relegated to one of the feeder leagues below provided there are enough suitable promotion candidates from those leagues. The champions of the three feeder leagues covering the NPL area are promoted each season. These are the Northern League, the Northern Counties East League, and the North West Counties League. Clubs in the northern extremities of the Midland League and the United Counties League may also be promoted to the Northern Premier League.

Should there be an unusually large or small number of clubs relegated to and/or promoted to the level of the NPL from Northern England, the National League System (NLS) Committee can order one or more of the NPL&#x27;s southernmost clubs to transfer to the Southern League (or vice versa) to maintain numerical balance between the leagues.

Division One North West and South East teams receive a bye to the preliminary round of FA Cup Qualification. Premier Division teams receive a bye to the first round of Qualification.

The league currently runs one cup competition, with all member clubs competing in the League Challenge Cup. In the past, the league has run other competitions, such as the Chairman&#x27;s Cup, the President&#x27;s Cup and the Peter Swales Shield.

<doc id="333355" wikidata="Q12200" url="?curid=333355" title="Crêpe">
<text>A crêpe or crepe ( , , ) is a dish made from unleavened batter or dough that is cooked on a frying pan or a griddle. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: &quot;sweet crêpes&quot; () or &quot;savoury galettes&quot; (). They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit, vegetables, meats, and a variety of spreads. Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette.

==Etymology==
The French term &quot;&quot; derives from , the feminine version of the Latin word , which means &quot;curled, wrinkled, having curly hair.&quot;

==Traditions==
In France, crêpes are traditionally served on the Christian holiday Candlemas (), on February 2. On that day in 472, Pope Gelasius I offered crepes as sacramental bread to French pilgrims that were visiting Rome for the Chandeleur. The sacramental bread was replaced by crêpes in France, and the day became known as &quot;Le Jour des Crêpes&quot; (&quot;The Day of the Crêpes&quot;). The day is also celebrated by many as the day that marks the transition from winter to spring (similar to the North American tradition of Groundhog Day), with the golden color and circular shape of crêpes representing the sun and the circle of life.

There are a few superstitions around the preparation of crêpes for Le Jour des Crêpes.

One example involves holding a gold coin (such as a Louis d&#x27;or) or ring in the left hand while successfully flipping a crêpe in a pan with the right hand. It&#x27;s said to bring a person wealth in the upcoming year (other variations describe a year of good weather).

Another version of the tradition involves cooking a crêpe with a gold coin on top. Some hide the first crêpe in a drawer instead of eating it for good luck in the coming year. Eating and sharing crêpes with others on Candlemas is another tradition based on popes giving food to the poor every year on February 2.

A traditional rhyming French proverb describes the tradition of eating crêpes on Candlemas: “manger des crêpes à la chandeleur apporte un an de bonheur” (eating crêpes on Candlemas brings a year of happiness).

== Types ==
Sweet crêpes are generally made with wheat flour (). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of breakfast or as a dessert. Common fillings include hazelnut cocoa spread, preserves, sugar (granulated or powdered), maple syrup, golden syrup, lemon juice, whipped cream, fruit spreads, custard, and sliced soft fruits or confiture.

Savory crêpes can be made with non-wheat flours such as buckwheat. A normal savory crêpe recipe includes using wheat flour but omitting the sugar. Batter made from buckwheat flour is gluten-free, which makes it possible for people who have a wheat allergy or gluten intolerance to eat this type of crêpe. Common savory fillings for crêpes are cheese, ham, and eggs, ratatouille, mushrooms, artichoke (in certain regions), and various meat products.

Batters can also consist of other ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar. Fillings are commonly added to the center of the crêpe and served with the edges partially folded over the center. An Indian variety of the crêpe uses a multi-grain flour called &quot;bhajanee,&quot; eggs, curd, and an assortment of spices as its ingredients. It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called Thalipeeth.

Crêpes can also be made into crepe cakes by stacking plain crepes on top of each other, adding a layer of filling between the layers. Fruits, chocolate, cookies, marshmallow, etc., can be added. Most crêpe cakes are sweet and considered dessert. It can also replace the traditional birthday cake. Crêpe cakes are usually 15–30 layers, and the crêpes used are very thin and soft.

A cake made with layers of crêpes with a filling in between is called “gâteau de crêpes” or “ミルクレープ(mille-crêpes)” (a Japanese-made French word combining crêpes and mille-feuille). This French pâtisserie, was popularized by Emy Wada, a pâtissière who studied in France and operated Paper Moon Cake Boutiques in Japan, in the 1980s. In 2001, she expanded to New York City, where she supplied crêpe cakes to popular chains Dean &amp; DeLuca and Takashimaya through the company Lady M.

==Recipe==
The standard recipe for French crêpe calls for flour, eggs, milk, salt, and butter. Sugar is optional. In the industrial production of crêpes, the dry ingredients are combined with eggs to form a dough. The rest of the wet ingredients are then added to thin the batter to a loose enough consistency to spread easily. The batter is added, one ladle at a time, to a hot, greased pan, cooked until golden, then flipped. Crêpe batter is characterized by its liquidity, making it easy to spread in a thin layer. Crêpes are also characterized by their quick cooking time, usually 20–30 seconds per side.

In older versions of crêpe recipes, beer or wine was used instead of milk. Buckwheat flour is often used as well, specifically in making a Breton Galette.

==Crêperies==
A crêperie () may be a takeaway restaurant or stall, serving crêpes as a form of fast food or street food, or it may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or café. Crêperies can be found throughout France, especially in Brittany, and in many other countries. Many also serve apple cider, a popular drink to accompany crêpes.

==Special crêpes==

&quot;Mille crêpes&quot; are a French cake made of many crêpe layers. The word &quot;mille&quot; means &quot;a thousand,&quot; implying the many layers of crêpe. Another standard French and Belgian crêpe is the &quot;crêpe Suzette&quot;, a crêpe with lightly grated orange peel and liqueur (usually Grand Marnier), which is lit during presentation.
The &quot;49er flapjack&quot; is a sourdough crêpe which is popular in the United States, getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the California Gold Rush. Because it is similar to a Swedish pancake, the 49er is sometimes served with lingonberry sauce, although most often, it is rolled up with butter and powdered sugar or served open-faced and topped with maple syrup.

&quot;Crêpe dentelle&quot; is a crispy biscuit made with a very thin layer of crêpe folded in a cigar shape and then baked. It is usually enjoyed with a hot drink during the &quot;goûter&quot;, in France.

==Crêpes in European culture==
In Norwegian, crêpes are called &quot;pannekake&quot;, and in most German regions &quot;Crêpes&quot; (referring to a wide and flat crêpe, as opposed to the smaller and thicker native &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; pancakes). In Swedish, a crêpe is called &quot;pannkaka&quot; in southern regions while being called &quot;plättar&quot; in the north. In Danish it is called &quot;pandekager&quot; (&quot;pancakes&quot;). In Icelandic it is called &quot;pönnukaka.&quot; In Finnish a crêpe is called either &quot;ohukainen&quot; or &quot;lettu&quot; or &quot; lätty&quot; or &quot;räiskäle.&quot; In Greek it is called krepa (Κρέπα). In Dutch it is a &quot;pannenkoek&quot; or &quot;flensje.&quot; In Afrikaans crêpes are called &quot;pannekoek&quot;, and are usually served with cinnamon and sugar. In the Spanish regions of Galicia and Asturias, they are traditionally served at carnivals. In Galicia, they&#x27;re called &quot;filloas&quot; and may also be made with pork blood instead of milk. In Asturias, they are called &quot;fayueles&quot; or &quot;frixuelos&quot;, and in Turkey, &quot;akıtma&quot;.

In areas of central Europe, formerly belonging to the Austro-Hungarian empire, there is a thin pancake comparable to a crêpe that in Austro-Bavarian is called &quot;Palatschinken&quot;; in ; and in Bosnian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Czech, Croatian, Serbian and ; in . In the Balkan countries, &quot;palačinka&quot; or &quot;pallaçinka&quot; may be eaten with fruit jam, quark cheese, sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream Nutella, while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants specializing in palačinci are called &quot;Palačinkara&quot; in the region. In Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the blintz. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians &quot;palacsinta&quot;, which it derives from the Romanian &quot;plăcintă&quot;, which comes in turn from classical Latin &quot;placenta&quot; (&quot;small flat cake&quot;), even though the Romanian &quot;plăcintă&quot; is more similar to a pie, and the crêpes are called &quot;clătită&quot;.

During the East Slavic celebration of Maslenitsa (Cheesefare Week), one of the most popular foods are blini, or crêpes. Since they are made from butter, eggs, and milk, crêpes can be consumed during the celebration by the Orthodox church. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour, milk can be switched for kefir, and oils can be added or substituted. Blini are served with butter and topped with caviar, cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam, or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun since the holiday is about the beginning of spring.
==Crêpes outside of Europe==
Crêpes have also long been popular in Japan and Malaysia, with sweet and savory varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called crêperies. In Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, they are called &quot;panqueques&quot; and are often eaten with dulce de leche. Various other French foods such as crêpes, soufflés, and quiche have slowly made their way into American cooking establishments. Typically, these franchises stick to the traditional French method of making crêpes, but they have also put their own spin on the crêpe with new types, such as the hamburger and pizza crêpe. In Canada, particularly in French-speaking regions, crêpes and galettes have long been traditional food items.
The Japanese crêpes developed into something different from the French crêpes due to their various fillings and toppings, and the style later spread outside of Japan. It is often called &#x27;Harajuku Crêpes&#x27;. In Japan, French crêpes were introduced in the 1970s, and they were only spread with jam and were not very popular. In 1977, Mizuki Ono opened a crêpe shop in Harajuku and, taking inspiration from ice cream monaka, began to sell crêpes with ice cream, whipped cream, and sliced fruit, which became very popular. They were rarely made at home and spread as sweets purchased from street stalls and eaten on the street.

In Mexico, crêpes are known as &quot;crepas&quot; and were introduced during the 19th century by the French and are typically served either as a sweet dessert when filled with &quot;cajeta&quot; (similar to dulce de leche), or as a savoury dish when filled with &quot;Huitlacoche&quot; (corn smut), which is considered a delicacy.

==Similar dishes in other cuisines==

In Southern India, a similar dish made of fermented rice batter is called a dosa, which often has savory fillings. In Western India, a dish made of gram flour is called &quot;Pudlaa&quot; or &quot;Poodla,&quot; with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called &quot;patibola&quot; and is sweet in taste due to milk, jaggery, or sugar. The injera of Ethiopian/Eritrean/Somali/Yemeni cuisine is often described as a thick crêpe. In Somalia, malawah is very similar to a crêpe. It is mostly eaten at breakfast.

In the Philippines, a native crêpe recipe is the &quot;daral&quot; which is made from ground glutinous rice and coconut milk batter (&quot;galapong&quot;). It is rolled into a cylinder and filled with sweetened coconut meat strips (&quot;hinti&quot;).

In Indonesia, Kue leker is a type of Indonesian crêpe. Also, &quot;ledre&quot;, a rolled banana crêpe from Bojonegoro.

In China, Jianbing is a traditional Chinese street food similar to crêpes. It is generally eaten for breakfast and hailed as &quot;one of China&#x27;s most popular street breakfasts.&quot; It consists of wheat and grain-based crepe, an egg, deep-fried crackers (known as Bao Cui/薄脆 in Chinese), 2–3 savory/spicy sauces, and chopped scallions &amp; coriander.

<text>Sir Joseph William Bazalgette (; 28 March 1819 – 15 March 1891) was an English civil engineer. As Chief Engineer of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Board of Works, his major achievement was the creation of a sewerage system for central London, in response to the Great Stink of 1858, which was instrumental in relieving the city of cholera epidemics, while beginning to clean the River Thames. He later designed Hammersmith Bridge.

==Early life==
Bazalgette was born at Hill Lodge, Clay Hill, Enfield, the son of Joseph William Bazalgette (1783–1849), a retired Royal Navy captain, and Theresa Philo &quot;née&quot; Pilton (1796–1850). His grandfather, Louis Bazalgette, a tailor and financier, was a Huguenot immigrant who developed ties to the future George IV and subsequently became wealthy.

In 1827, when Joseph was eight years old, the family moved into a newly built house in Hamilton Terrace, St John&#x27;s Wood, London. He spent his early career articled to the noted engineer Sir John Macneill, working on railway projects, and amassed sufficient experience (partly in China and Ireland) in land drainage and reclamation to enable him to set up his own London consulting practice in 1842.

In 1845 the house in Hamilton Terrace was sold and Joseph married Maria Keogh, from County Kilkenny in Ireland. At the time he was working so hard on expanding the railway network that two years later, in 1847, he suffered a nervous breakdown.

In 1847, while he was recovering, London&#x27;s Metropolitan Commission of Sewers ordered that all cesspits should be closed and that house drains should connect to sewers and empty into the Thames. A cholera epidemic ensued, killing 14,137 Londoners in 1849.

Bazalgette was appointed Assistant Surveyor to the Metropolitan Commission in 1849, taking over as Engineer in 1852 after his predecessor died of &quot;harassing fatigues and anxieties.&quot; Soon after, another cholera epidemic struck in 1853, killing 10,738. Medical opinion at the time held that cholera was caused by foul air: a so-called &quot;miasma&quot;. Physician John Snow had earlier advanced a different explanation, which is now known to be correct: cholera was spread by contaminated water, but his view was not then generally accepted.

Championed by fellow engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Bazalgette was promoted Chief Engineer of the Commission&#x27;s successor, the Metropolitan Board of Works, in 1856 (a post which he retained until the MBW was abolished and replaced by London County Council in 1889). In 1858, the year of the Great Stink, Parliament passed an Enabling Act, despite the colossal expense of the project, and Bazalgette&#x27;s proposals to revolutionise London&#x27;s sewerage system began to be implemented. The expectation was that enclosed sewers would eliminate the stink (&#x27;miasma&#x27;) that was thought to be the cause of cholera and, as a result, eliminate cholera epidemics.

==Sewer works==


At that time, the River Thames was little more than an open sewer, empty of any fish or other wildlife, and an apparent public health hazard to Londoners.

Bazalgette&#x27;s solution (similar to a proposal made by painter John Martin 25 years earlier) was to construct a network of of enclosed underground brick main sewers to intercept sewage outflows, and of street sewers, to divert the raw sewage which flowed freely through the streets and thoroughfares of London to the river.

The plan included major pumping stations at Deptford (1864) and at Crossness (1865) on the Erith marshes, both on the south side of the Thames and at Abbey Mills (in the River Lea valley, 1868) and on the Chelsea Embankment (close to Grosvenor Bridge; 1875), north of the river. The outflows were diverted downstream, where they were collected in two large sewage outfall systems on the north and south sides of the Thames, called the Northern and Southern Outfall Sewers. The sewage from the Outfall Sewers was originally collected in balancing tanks in Beckton and Crossness, then dumped, untreated, into the Thames at high tide.

The system was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales in 1865, although the whole project was not completed for another ten years.

Partly as a result of the Princess Alice disaster, extensive sewage treatment facilities were built to replace the balancing tanks in Beckton and Crossness in 1900.

The basic premise of this expensive project, that miasma spread cholera infection, was wrong. However, the new sewer system&#x27;s unintended consequence was removing the causal bacterium from the water supply, thereby eliminating cholera in areas served by the sewers. Instead of the incorrect premise causing the project to fail, the new sewers mostly eliminated cholera, and also decreased the incidence of typhus and typhoid epidemics.

Bazalgette&#x27;s capacity for hard work was remarkable; every connection to the sewerage system by the various Vestry Councils had to be checked, and Bazalgette did this himself, and the records contain thousands of linen plans with handwritten comments in Indian ink on them &quot;Approved JWB&quot;, &quot;I do not like 6&quot; used here and 9&quot; should be used. JWB&quot;, and so on. Unsurprisingly, his health suffered as a result. Thames Water holds the records in large blue binders gold-blocked reading &quot;Metropolitan Board of Works&quot; and then dated, usually two per year.

==Family==

Scion of a Huguenot family, Bazalgette was brought up at 17 Hamilton Terrace, St John&#x27;s Wood in North West London. In 1845, he moved to Morden, then in 1873 to Arthur Road, Wimbledon, where he died in 1891. He was buried at nearby St Mary&#x27;s Church, London SW18.

Married in 1845, at Westminster, to Maria Keogh (1819–1902), daughter of Edward Keogh, JP (Ireland), Sir Joseph and Lady Bazalgette had eleven children including:
#Joseph William, born 20 February 1846
#Charles Norman, born 3 March 1847
#Edward, born 28 June 1848
#Theresa Philo, born 11 August 1850
#Caroline, born 17 July 1852; married George Chatterton
#Maria, born 1854; married Robert Wickham
#Henry, born 14 September 1855
#Willoughby, born 18 March 1857
#Maria Louise, born 1859; died unmarried
#Anna Constance, born 3 December 1859, married Major Frederick Blacker
#Evelyn, born 1 April 1861

==Awards and memorials==
Knighted in 1875, Bazalgette was elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1883.

A Greater London Council blue plaque commemorates him at 17 Hamilton Terrace in St John&#x27;s Wood in North London, as well as a formal monument on the Victoria Embankment by the River Thames in central London. In July 2020, the City of London Corporation announced that a new public space west of Blackfriars Bridge, formed following construction of the Thames Tideway Scheme, would be named the Bazalgette Embankment.

Dulwich College has a scholarship in his name either for design and technology or for mathematics and science.

<text>Modal logic is a kind of logic used to represent statements about necessity and possibility. It plays a major role in philosophy and related fields as a tool for understanding concepts such as knowledge, obligation, and causation. For instance, in epistemic modal logic, the formula formula_1 can be used to represent the statement that formula_2 is known. In deontic modal logic, that same formula can represent that formula_2 is a moral obligation. Modal logic considers the inferences that modal statements give rise to. For instance, most epistemic modal logics treat the formula formula_4 as a tautology, representing the principle that only true statements can count as knowledge. However, this formula is not a tautology in deontic modal logic, since what ought to be true can be false.

Modal logics are formal systems that include unary operators such as formula_5 and formula_6, representing possibility and necessity respectively. For instance the modal formula formula_7 can be read as &quot;possibly formula_2&quot; while formula_1 can be read as &quot;necessarily formula_2&quot;. In the standard relational semantics for modal logic, formulas are assigned truth values relative to a &quot;possible world&quot;. A formula&#x27;s truth value at one possible world can depend on the truth values of other formulas at other &quot;accessible&quot; possible worlds. In particular, formula_7 is true at a world if formula_2 is true at &quot;some&quot; accessible possible world, while formula_1 is true at a world if formula_2 is true at &quot;every&quot; accessible possible world. A variety of proof systems exist which are sound and complete with respect to the semantics one gets by restricting the accessibility relation. For instance, the deontic modal logic D is sound and complete if one requires the accessibility relation to be serial.

While the intuition behind modal logic dates back to antiquity, the first modal axiomatic systems were developed by C. I. Lewis in 1912. The now-standard relational semantics emerged in the mid twentieth century from work by Arthur Prior, Jaakko Hintikka, and Saul Kripke. Recent developments include alternative topological semantics such as neighborhood semantics as well as applications of the relational semantics beyond its original philosophical motivation. Such applications include game theory, moral and legal theory, web design, multiverse-based set theory, and social epistemology.

== Syntax of modal operators ==

Modal logic differs from other kinds of logic in that it uses modal operators such as formula_6 and formula_5. The former is conventionally read aloud as &quot;necessarily&quot;, and can be used to represent notions such as moral or legal obligation, knowledge, historical inevitability, among others. The latter is typically read as &quot;possibly&quot; and can be used to represent notions including permission, ability, compatibility with evidence. While well-formed formulas of modal logic include non-modal formulas such as formula_17, it also contains modal ones such as formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, and so on. 

Thus, the language formula_21 of basic propositional logic can be defined recursively as follows.

#If formula_22 is an atomic formula, then formula_22 is a formula of formula_21.
#If formula_22 is a formula of formula_21, then formula_27 is too.
#If formula_22 and formula_29 are formulas of formula_21, then formula_31 is too.
#If formula_22 is a formula of formula_21, then formula_34 is too.
#If formula_22 is a formula of formula_21, then formula_37 is too.

Modal operators can be added to other kinds of logic by introducing rules analogous to #4 and #5 above. Modal predicate logic is one widely used variant which includes formulas such as formula_38. In systems of modal logic where formula_6 and formula_5 are duals, formula_37 can be taken as an abbreviation for formula_42, thus eliminating the need for a separate syntactic rule to introduce it. However, separate syntactic rules are necessary in systems where the two operators are not interdefinable.

Common notational variants include symbols such as formula_43 and formula_44 in systems of modal logic used to represent knowledge and formula_45 and formula_46 in those used to represent belief. These notations are particularly common in systems which use multiple modal operators simultaneously. For instance, a combined epistemic-deontic logic could use the formula formula_47 read as &quot;I know P is permitted&quot;. Systems of modal logic can include infinitely many modal operators distinguished by indices, i.e. formula_48, formula_49, formula_50, and so on.

==Semantics==

===Relational semantics===

==== Basic notions ====

The standard semantics for modal logic is called the &quot;relational semantics&quot;. In this approach, the truth of a formula is determined relative to a point which is often called a &quot;possible world&quot;. For a formula that contains a modal operator, its truth value can depend on what is true at other accessible worlds. Thus, the relational semantics interprets formulas of modal logic using models defined as follows.

* A &quot;relational model&quot; is a tuple formula_51 where:
# formula_52 is a set of possible worlds
# formula_53 is a binary relation on formula_54
# formula_55 is a valuation function which assigns a truth value to each pair of an atomic formula and a world, (i.e. formula_56 where formula_57 is the set of atomic formulae)

The set formula_52 is often called the &quot;universe&quot;. The binary relation formula_59 is called an accessibility relation, and it controls which worlds can &quot;see&quot; each other for the sake of determining what is true. For example, formula_60 means that the world formula_61 is accessible from world formula_62. That is to say, the state of affairs known as formula_61 is a live possibility for formula_62. Finally, the function formula_65 is known as a valuation function. It determines which atomic formulas are true at which worlds.

Then we recursively define the truth of a formula at a world formula_62 in a model formula_67:

* formula_68 iff formula_69
* formula_70 iff formula_71
* formula_72 iff formula_73 and formula_74
* formula_75 iff for every element formula_61 of formula_77, if formula_78 then formula_79
* formula_80 iff for some element formula_61 of formula_77, it holds that formula_60 and formula_79

According to this semantics, a formula is &quot;necessary&quot; with respect to a world formula_62 if it holds at every world that is accessible from formula_62. It is &quot;possible&quot; if it holds at some world that is accessible from formula_62. Possibility thereby depends upon the accessibility relation formula_59, which allows us to express the relative nature of possibility. For example, we might say that given our laws of physics it is not possible for humans to travel faster than the speed of light, but that given other circumstances it could have been possible to do so. Using the accessibility relation we can translate this scenario as follows: At all of the worlds accessible to our own world, it is not the case that humans can travel faster than the speed of light, but at one of these accessible worlds there is &quot;another&quot; world accessible from &quot;those&quot; worlds but not accessible from our own at which humans can travel faster than the speed of light.

==== Frames and completeness====

The choice of accessibility relation alone can sometimes be sufficient to guarantee the truth or falsity of a formula. For instance, consider a model formula_67 whose accessibility relation is reflexive. Because the relation is reflexive, we will have that formula_90 for any formula_91 regardless of which valuation function is used. For this reason, modal logicians sometimes talk about &quot;frames&quot;, which are the portion of a relational model excluding the valuation function.

* A &quot;relational frame&quot; is a pair formula_92 where formula_93 is a set of possible worlds, formula_53 is a binary relation on formula_95.

The different systems of modal logic are defined using &quot;frame conditions&quot;. A frame is called:

* reflexive if &quot;w R w&quot;, for every &quot;w&quot; in &quot;G&quot;
* symmetric if &quot;w R u&quot; implies &quot;u R w&quot;, for all &quot;w&quot; and &quot;u&quot; in &quot;G&quot;
* transitive if &quot;w R u&quot; and &quot;u R q&quot; together imply &quot;w R q&quot;, for all &quot;w&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;q&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.
* serial if, for every &quot;w&quot; in &quot;G&quot; there is some &quot;u&quot; in &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;w R u&quot;.
* Euclidean if, for every &quot;u&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;w&quot;, &quot;w R u&quot; and &quot;w R t&quot; implies &quot;u R t&quot; (by symmetry, it also implies &quot;t R u&quot;, as well as &quot;t R t&quot; and &quot;u R u&quot;)

The logics that stem from these frame conditions are:
*&quot;K&quot; := no conditions
*&quot;D&quot; := serial
*&quot;T&quot; := reflexive
*&quot;B&quot; := reflexive and symmetric
*&quot;S4&quot; := reflexive and transitive
*&quot;S5&quot; := reflexive and Euclidean

The Euclidean property along with reflexivity yields symmetry and transitivity. (The Euclidean property can be obtained, as well, from symmetry and transitivity.) Hence if the accessibility relation &quot;R&quot; is reflexive and Euclidean, &quot;R&quot; is provably symmetric and transitive as well. Hence for models of S5, &quot;R&quot; is an equivalence relation, because &quot;R&quot; is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

We can prove that these frames produce the same set of valid sentences as do the frames where all worlds can see all other worlds of &quot;W&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, where &quot;R&quot; is a &quot;total&quot; relation). This gives the corresponding &quot;modal graph&quot; which is total complete (&quot;i.e.&quot;, no more edges (relations) can be added). For example, in any modal logic based on frame conditions:
: formula_96 if and only if for some element &quot;u&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, it holds that formula_79 and &quot;w R u&quot;.

If we consider frames based on the total relation we can just say that
: formula_96 if and only if for some element &quot;u&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, it holds that formula_79.
We can drop the accessibility clause from the latter stipulation because in such total frames it is trivially true of all &quot;w&quot; and &quot;u&quot; that &quot;w R u&quot;. But this does not have to be the case in all S5 frames, which can still consist of multiple parts that are fully connected among themselves but still disconnected from each other.

All of these logical systems can also be defined axiomatically, as is shown in the next section. For example, in S5, the axioms formula_100, formula_101 and formula_102 (corresponding to &quot;symmetry&quot;, &quot;transitivity&quot; and &quot;reflexivity&quot;, respectively) hold, whereas at least one of these axioms does not hold in each of the other, weaker logics.

=== Topological semantics ===

Modal logic has also been interpreted using topological structures. For instance, the &quot;Interior Semantics&quot; interprets formulas of modal logic as follows.

A &quot;topological model&quot; is a tuple formula_103 where formula_104 is a topological space and formula_65 is a valuation function which maps each atomic formula to some subset of formula_106. The basic interior semantics interprets formulas of modal logic as follows:

* formula_107 iff formula_108
* formula_109 iff formula_110
* formula_111 iff formula_112 and formula_113
* formula_114 iff for some formula_115 we have both that formula_116 and also that formula_117 for all formula_118

Topological approaches subsume relational ones, allowing non-normal modal logics. The extra structure they provide also allows a transparent way of modeling certain concepts such as the evidence or justification one has for one&#x27;s beliefs. Topological semantics is widely used in recent work in formal epistemology and has antecedents in earlier work such as David Lewis and Angelika Kratzer&#x27;s logics for counterfactuals.

==Axiomatic systems==

The first formalizations of modal logic were axiomatic. Numerous variations with very different properties have been proposed since C. I. Lewis began working in the area in 1912. Hughes and Cresswell (1996), for example, describe 42 normal and 25 non-normal modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes some systems Hughes and Cresswell omit.

Modern treatments of modal logic begin by augmenting the propositional calculus with two unary operations, one denoting &quot;necessity&quot; and the other &quot;possibility&quot;. The notation of C. I. Lewis, much employed since, denotes &quot;necessarily &quot;p&quot;&quot; by a prefixed &quot;box&quot; (□&quot;p&quot;) whose scope is established by parentheses. Likewise, a prefixed &quot;diamond&quot; (◇&quot;p&quot;) denotes &quot;possibly &quot;p&quot;&quot;. Similar to the quantifiers in first-order logic, &quot;necessarily &quot;p&quot;&quot; (□&quot;p&quot;) does not assume the range of quantification (the set of accessible possible worlds in Kripke semantics) to be non-empty, whereas &quot;possibly &quot;p&quot;&quot; (◇&quot;p&quot;) often implicitly assumes formula_119 (viz. the set of accessible possible worlds is non-empty). Regardless of notation, each of these operators is definable in terms of the other in classical modal logic:
* □&quot;p&quot; (necessarily &quot;p&quot;) is equivalent to (&quot;not possible that not-&quot;p&quot;&quot;)
* ◇&quot;p&quot; (possibly &quot;p&quot;) is equivalent to (&quot;not necessarily not-&quot;p&quot;&quot;)
Hence □ and ◇ form a dual pair of operators.

In many modal logics, the necessity and possibility operators satisfy the following analogues of de Morgan&#x27;s laws from Boolean algebra:

:&quot;It is not necessary that &quot;X&quot;&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;It is possible that not &quot;X&quot;&quot;.
:&quot;It is not possible that &quot;X&quot;&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;It is necessary that not &quot;X&quot;.

Precisely what axioms and rules must be added to the propositional calculus to create a usable system of modal logic is a matter of philosophical opinion, often driven by the theorems one wishes to prove; or, in computer science, it is a matter of what sort of computational or deductive system one wishes to model. Many modal logics, known collectively as normal modal logics, include the following rule and axiom:
* N, Necessitation Rule: If &quot;p&quot; is a theorem/tautology (of any system/model invoking N), then □&quot;p&quot; is likewise a theorem (i.e. formula_120).
* K, Distribution Axiom: 

The weakest normal modal logic, named &quot;K&quot;&quot; in honor of Saul Kripke, is simply the propositional calculus augmented by □, the rule N, and the axiom K. &quot;K&quot; is weak in that it fails to determine whether a proposition can be necessary but only contingently necessary. That is, it is not a theorem of &quot;K&quot; that if □&quot;p&quot; is true then □□&quot;p&quot; is true, i.e., that necessary truths are &quot;necessarily necessary&quot;. If such perplexities are deemed forced and artificial, this defect of &quot;K&quot; is not a great one. In any case, different answers to such questions yield different systems of modal logic.

Adding axioms to &quot;K&quot; gives rise to other well-known modal systems. One cannot prove in &quot;K&quot; that if &quot;&quot;p&quot; is necessary&quot; then &quot;p&quot; is true. The axiom T remedies this defect:
*T, Reflexivity Axiom: (If &quot;p&quot; is necessary, then &quot;p&quot; is the case.) 
T holds in most but not all modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes a few exceptions, such as &quot;S10&quot;.

Other well-known elementary axioms are:
*4: formula_121
*B: formula_122
*D: formula_123
*5: formula_124

These yield the systems (axioms in bold, systems in italics):
*&quot;K&quot; := K + N
*&quot;T&quot; := &quot;K&quot; + T
*&quot;S4&quot; := &quot;T&quot; + 4
*&quot;S5&quot; := &quot;T&quot; + 5
*&quot;D&quot; := &quot;K&quot; + D.
&quot;K&quot; through &quot;S5&quot; form a nested hierarchy of systems, making up the core of normal modal logic. But specific rules or sets of rules may be appropriate for specific systems. For example, in deontic logic, formula_123 (If it ought to be that &quot;p&quot;, then it is permitted that &quot;p&quot;) seems appropriate, but we should probably not include that formula_122. In fact, to do so is to commit the naturalistic fallacy (i.e. to state that what is natural is also good, by saying that if &quot;p&quot; is the case, &quot;p&quot; ought to be permitted).

The commonly employed system &quot;S5&quot; simply makes all modal truths necessary. For example, if &quot;p&quot; is possible, then it is &quot;necessary&quot; that &quot;p&quot; is possible. Also, if &quot;p&quot; is necessary, then it is necessary that &quot;p&quot; is necessary. Other systems of modal logic have been formulated, in part because &quot;S5&quot; does not describe every kind of modality of interest.

===Structural proof theory===
Sequent calculi and systems of natural deduction have been developed for several modal logics, but it has proven hard to combine generality with other features expected of good structural proof theories, such as purity (the proof theory does not introduce extra-logical notions such as labels) and analyticity (the logical rules support a clean notion of analytic proof). More complex calculi have been applied to modal logic to achieve generality.

===Decision methods===
Analytic tableaux provide the most popular decision method for modal logics.

==Modal logics in philosophy==

===Alethic logic===

Modalities of necessity and possibility are called &quot;alethic&quot; modalities. They are also sometimes called &quot;special&quot; modalities, from the Latin &quot;species&quot;. Modal logic was first developed to deal with these concepts, and only afterward was extended to others. For this reason, or perhaps for their familiarity and simplicity, necessity and possibility are often casually treated as &quot;the&quot; subject matter of modal logic. Moreover, it is easier to make sense of relativizing necessity, e.g. to legal, physical, nomological, epistemic, and so on, than it is to make sense of relativizing other notions.

In classical modal logic, a proposition is said to be
*possible if it is &quot;not necessarily false&quot; (regardless of whether it is actually true or actually false);
*necessary if it is &quot;not possibly false&quot; (i.e. true and necessarily true);
*contingent if it is &quot;not necessarily false&quot; and &quot;not necessarily true&quot; (i.e. possible but not necessarily true);
*impossible if it is &quot;not possibly true&quot; (i.e. false and necessarily false).

In classical modal logic, therefore, the notion of either possibility or necessity may be taken to be basic, where these other notions are defined in terms of it in the manner of De Morgan duality. Intuitionistic modal logic treats possibility and necessity as not perfectly symmetric.

For example, suppose that while walking to the convenience store we pass Friedrich&#x27;s house, and observe that the lights are off. On the way back, we observe that they have been turned on.
* &quot;Somebody or something turned the lights on&quot; is &quot;necessary&quot;.
* &quot;Friedrich turned the lights on&quot;, &quot;Friedrich&#x27;s roommate Max turned the lights on&quot; and &quot;A burglar named Adolf broke into Friedrich&#x27;s house and turned the lights on&quot; are &quot;contingent&quot;.
* All of the above statements are &quot;possible&quot;.
* It is &quot;impossible&quot; that Socrates (who has been dead for over two thousand years) turned the lights on.
(Of course, this analogy does not apply alethic modality in a &quot;truly&quot; rigorous fashion; for it to do so, it would have to axiomatically make such statements as &quot;human beings cannot rise from the dead&quot;, &quot;Socrates was a human being and not an immortal vampire&quot;, and &quot;we did not take hallucinogenic drugs which caused us to falsely believe the lights were on&quot;, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. Absolute certainty of truth or falsehood exists only in the sense of logically constructed abstract concepts such as &quot;it is impossible to draw a triangle with four sides&quot; and &quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot;.)

For those having difficulty with the concept of something being possible but not true, the meaning of these terms may be made more comprehensible by thinking of multiple &quot;possible worlds&quot; (in the sense of Leibniz) or &quot;alternate universes&quot;; something &quot;necessary&quot; is true in all possible worlds, something &quot;possible&quot; is true in at least one possible world. 

====Physical possibility====
Something is physically, or nomically, possible if it is permitted by the laws of physics. For example, current theory is thought to allow for there to be an atom with an atomic number of 126, even if there are no such atoms in existence. In contrast, while it is logically possible to accelerate beyond the speed of light, modern science stipulates that it is not physically possible for material particles or information.

====Metaphysical possibility====

Philosophers debate if objects have properties independent of those dictated by scientific laws. For example, it might be metaphysically necessary, as some who advocate physicalism have thought, that all thinking beings have bodies and can experience the passage of time. Saul Kripke has argued that every person necessarily has the parents they do have: anyone with different parents would not be the same person.

Metaphysical possibility has been thought to be more restricting than bare logical possibility (i.e., fewer things are metaphysically possible than are logically possible). However, its exact relation (if any) to logical possibility or to physical possibility is a matter of dispute. Philosophers also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely &quot;by definition&quot;, or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world, or something else entirely.

===Epistemic logic===
Epistemic modalities (from the Greek &quot;episteme&quot;, knowledge), deal with the &quot;certainty&quot; of sentences. The □ operator is translated as &quot;x is certain that…&quot;, and the ◇ operator is translated as &quot;For all x knows, it may be true that…&quot; In ordinary speech both metaphysical and epistemic modalities are often expressed in similar words; the following contrasts may help:

A person, Jones, might reasonably say &quot;both&quot;: (1) &quot;No, it is &quot;not&quot; possible that Bigfoot exists; I am quite certain of that&quot;; &quot;and&quot;, (2) &quot;Sure, it&#x27;s &quot;possible&quot; that Bigfoots could exist&quot;. What Jones means by (1) is that, given all the available information, there is no question remaining as to whether Bigfoot exists. This is an epistemic claim. By (2) he makes the &quot;metaphysical&quot; claim that it is &quot;possible for&quot; Bigfoot to exist, &quot;even though he does not&quot;: there is no physical or biological reason that large, featherless, bipedal creatures with thick hair could not exist in the forests of North America (regardless of whether or not they do). Similarly, &quot;it is possible for the person reading this sentence to be fourteen feet tall and named Chad&quot; is &quot;metaphysically&quot; true (such a person would not somehow be prevented from doing so on account of their height and name), but not &quot;alethically&quot; true unless you match that description, and not &quot;epistemically&quot; true if it is known that fourteen-foot-tall human beings have never existed.

From the other direction, Jones might say, (3) &quot;It is &quot;possible&quot; that Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is true; but also &quot;possible&quot; that it is false&quot;, and &quot;also&quot; (4) &quot;if it &quot;is&quot; true, then it is necessarily true, and not possibly false&quot;. Here Jones means that it is &quot;epistemically possible&quot; that it is true or false, for all he knows (Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture has not been proven either true or false), but if there &quot;is&quot; a proof (heretofore undiscovered), then it would show that it is not &quot;logically&quot; possible for Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture to be false—there could be no set of numbers that violated it. Logical possibility is a form of &quot;alethic&quot; possibility; (4) makes a claim about whether it is possible (i.e., logically speaking) that a mathematical truth to have been false, but (3) only makes a claim about whether it is possible, for all Jones knows, (i.e., speaking of certitude) that the mathematical claim is specifically either true or false, and so again Jones does not contradict himself. It is worthwhile to observe that Jones is not necessarily correct: It is possible (epistemically) that Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is both true and unprovable.

Epistemic possibilities also bear on the actual world in a way that metaphysical possibilities do not. Metaphysical possibilities bear on ways the world &quot;might have been,&quot; but epistemic possibilities bear on the way the world &quot;may be&quot; (for all we know). Suppose, for example, that I want to know whether or not to take an umbrella before I leave. If you tell me &quot;it is &quot;possible that&quot; it is raining outside&quot; – in the sense of epistemic possibility – then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if you just tell me that &quot;it is &quot;possible for&quot; it to rain outside&quot; – in the sense of &quot;metaphysical possibility&quot; – then I am no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment.

Some features of epistemic modal logic are in debate. For example, if &quot;x&quot; knows that &quot;p&quot;, does &quot;x&quot; know that it knows that &quot;p&quot;? That is to say, should □&quot;P&quot; → □□&quot;P&quot; be an axiom in these systems? While the answer to this question is unclear, there is at least one axiom that is generally included in epistemic modal logic, because it is minimally true of all normal modal logics (see the section on axiomatic systems):
* K, &quot;Distribution Axiom&quot;: formula_127.

It has been questioned whether the epistemic and alethic modalities should be considered distinct from each other. The criticism states that there is no real difference between &quot;the truth in the world&quot; (alethic) and &quot;the truth in an individual&#x27;s mind&quot; (epistemic). An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished, as by the means of a grammatical mood.

===Temporal logic===
Temporal logic is an approach to the semantics of expressions with tense, that is, expressions with qualifications of when. Some expressions, such as &#x27;2 + 2 = 4&#x27;, are true at all times, while tensed expressions such as &#x27;John is happy&#x27; are only true sometimes.

In temporal logic, tense constructions are treated in terms of modalities, where a standard method for formalizing talk of time is to use &quot;two&quot; pairs of operators, one for the past and one for the future (P will just mean &#x27;it is presently the case that P&#x27;). For example:

:F&quot;P&quot; : It will sometimes be the case that &quot;P&quot;
:G&quot;P&quot; : It will always be the case that &quot;P&quot;
:P&quot;P&quot; : It was sometime the case that &quot;P&quot;
:H&quot;P&quot; : It has always been the case that &quot;P&quot;

There are then at least three modal logics that we can develop. For example, we can stipulate that,

:formula_128 = &quot;P&quot; is the case at some time &quot;t&quot;
:formula_129 = &quot;P&quot; is the case at every time &quot;t&quot;

Or we can trade these operators to deal only with the future (or past). For example,

:formula_130 = F&quot;P&quot;
:formula_131 = G&quot;P&quot;

or,

:formula_132 = &quot;P&quot; and/or F&quot;P&quot;
:formula_133 = &quot;P&quot; and G&quot;P&quot;

The operators F and G may seem initially foreign, but they create normal modal systems. FP&quot; is the same as ¬G¬&quot;P&quot;. We can combine the above operators to form complex statements. For example, PP&quot; → □P&quot;P&quot; says (effectively), &quot;Everything that is past and true is necessary&quot;.

It seems reasonable to say that possibly it will rain tomorrow, and possibly it will not; on the other hand, since we cannot change the past, if it is true that it rained yesterday, it cannot be true that it may not have rained yesterday. It seems the past is &quot;fixed&quot;, or necessary, in a way the future is not. This is sometimes referred to as accidental necessity. But if the past is &quot;fixed&quot;, and everything that is in the future will eventually be in the past, then it seems plausible to say that future events are necessary too.

Similarly, the problem of future contingents considers the semantics of assertions about the future: is either of the propositions &#x27;There will be a sea battle tomorrow&#x27;, or &#x27;There will not be a sea battle tomorrow&#x27; now true? Considering this thesis led Aristotle to reject the principle of bivalence for assertions concerning the future.

Additional binary operators are also relevant to temporal logics (see Linear temporal logic).

Versions of temporal logic can be used in computer science to model computer operations and prove theorems about them. In one version, ◇&quot;P&quot; means &quot;at a future time in the computation it is possible that the computer state will be such that P is true&quot;; □&quot;P&quot; means &quot;at all future times in the computation P will be true&quot;. In another version, ◇&quot;P&quot; means &quot;at the immediate next state of the computation, &quot;P&quot; might be true&quot;; □&quot;P&quot; means &quot;at the immediate next state of the computation, P will be true&quot;. These differ in the choice of Accessibility relation. (P always means &quot;P is true at the current computer state&quot;.) These two examples involve nondeterministic or not-fully-understood computations; there are many other modal logics specialized to different types of program analysis. Each one naturally leads to slightly different axioms.

===Deontic logic===
Likewise talk of morality, or of obligation and norms generally, seems to have a modal structure. The difference between &quot;You must do this&quot; and &quot;You may do this&quot; looks a lot like the difference between &quot;This is necessary&quot; and &quot;This is possible&quot;. Such logics are called &quot;deontic&quot;, from the Greek for &quot;duty&quot;.

Deontic logics commonly lack the axiom T semantically corresponding to the reflexivity of the accessibility relation in Kripke semantics: in symbols, formula_134. Interpreting □ as &quot;it is obligatory that&quot;, T informally says that every obligation is true. For example, if it is obligatory not to kill others (i.e. killing is morally forbidden), then T implies that people actually do not kill others. The consequent is obviously false.

Instead, using Kripke semantics, we say that though our own world does not realize all obligations, the worlds accessible to it do (i.e., T holds at these worlds). These worlds are called &quot;idealized&quot; worlds. &quot;P&quot; is obligatory with respect to our own world if at all idealized worlds accessible to our world, &quot;P&quot; holds. Though this was one of the first interpretations of the formal semantics, it has recently come under criticism.

One other principle that is often (at least traditionally) accepted as a deontic principle is &quot;D&quot;, formula_135, which corresponds to the seriality (or extendability or unboundedness) of the accessibility relation. It is an embodiment of the Kantian idea that &quot;ought implies can&quot;. (Clearly the &quot;can&quot; can be interpreted in various senses, e.g. in a moral or alethic sense.)

====Intuitive problems with deontic logic====
When we try to formalize ethics with standard modal logic, we run into some problems. Suppose that we have a proposition &quot;K&quot;: you have stolen some money, and another, &quot;Q&quot;: you have stolen a small amount of money. Now suppose we want to express the thought that &quot;if you have stolen some money, it ought to be a small amount of money&quot;. There are two likely candidates,
: (1) formula_136
: (2) formula_137

But (1) and &quot;K&quot; together entail □&quot;Q&quot;, which says that it ought to be the case that you have stolen a small amount of money. This surely is not right, because you ought not to have stolen anything at all. And (2) does not work either: If the right representation of &quot;if you have stolen some money it ought to be a small amount&quot; is (2), then the right representation of (3) &quot;if you have stolen some money then it ought to be a large amount&quot; is formula_138. Now suppose (as seems reasonable) that you ought not to steal anything, or formula_139. But then we can deduce formula_138 via formula_141 and formula_142 (the contrapositive of formula_143); so sentence (3) follows from our hypothesis (of course the same logic shows sentence (2)). But that cannot be right, and is not right when we use natural language. Telling someone they should not steal certainly does not imply that they should steal large amounts of money if they do engage in theft.

=== Doxastic logic ===
&quot;Doxastic logic&quot; concerns the logic of belief (of some set of agents). The term doxastic is derived from the ancient Greek &quot;doxa&quot; which means &quot;belief&quot;. Typically, a doxastic logic uses □, often written &quot;B&quot;, to mean &quot;It is believed that&quot;, or when relativized to a particular agent s, &quot;It is believed by s that&quot;.

== Metaphysical questions ==

In the most common interpretation of modal logic, one considers &quot;logically possible worlds&quot;. If a statement is true in all possible worlds, then it is a necessary truth. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is not true in all possible worlds, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some possible world (not necessarily our own) is called a possible truth.

Under this &quot;possible worlds idiom&quot;, to maintain that Bigfoot&#x27;s existence is possible but not actual, one says, &quot;There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists; but in the actual world, Bigfoot does not exist&quot;. However, it is unclear what this claim commits us to. Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds, every bit as real as our actual world, just not actual? Saul Kripke believes that &#x27;possible world&#x27; is something of a misnomer – that the term &#x27;possible world&#x27; is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility. For him, the sentences &quot;you could have rolled a 4 instead of a 6&quot; and &quot;there is a possible world where you rolled a 4, but you rolled a 6 in the actual world&quot; are not significantly different statements, and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world. David Lewis, on the other hand, made himself notorious by biting the bullet, asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own, and that what distinguishes our world as &quot;actual&quot; is simply that it is indeed our world – &quot;this&quot; world. That position is a major tenet of &quot;modal realism&quot;. Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism, considering it ontologically extravagant, and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments. Robert Adams holds that &#x27;possible worlds&#x27; are better thought of as &#x27;world-stories&#x27;, or consistent sets of propositions. Thus, it is possible that you rolled a 4 if such a state of affairs can be described coherently.

Computer scientists will generally pick a highly specific interpretation of the modal operators specialized to the particular sort of computation being analysed. In place of &quot;all worlds&quot;, you may have &quot;all possible next states of the computer&quot;, or &quot;all possible future states of the computer&quot;.

==Further applications==
Modal logics have begun to be used in areas of the humanities such as literature, poetry, art and history. In the philosophy of religion, modal logics are commonly used in arguments for the existence of God.

==History==
The basic ideas of modal logic date back to antiquity. Aristotle developed a modal syllogistic in Book I of his &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; (ch. 8–22), which Theophrastus attempted to improve. There are also passages in Aristotle&#x27;s work, such as the famous sea-battle argument in &quot;De Interpretatione&quot; §9, that are now seen as anticipations of the connection of modal logic with potentiality and time. In the Hellenistic period, the logicians Diodorus Cronus, Philo the Dialectician and the Stoic Chrysippus each developed a modal system that accounted for the interdefinability of possibility and necessity, accepted axiom T (see below), and combined elements of modal logic and temporal logic in attempts to solve the notorious Master Argument. The earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by Avicenna, who ultimately developed a theory of &quot;temporally modal&quot; syllogistic. Modal logic as a self-aware subject owes much to the writings of the Scholastics, in particular William of Ockham and John Duns Scotus, who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about essence and accident.

In the 19th century, Hugh MacColl made innovative contributions to modal logic, but did not find much acknowledgment. C. I. Lewis founded modern modal logic in a series of scholarly articles beginning in 1912 with &quot;Implication and the Algebra of Logic&quot;. Lewis was led to invent modal logic, and specifically strict implication, on the grounds that classical logic grants paradoxes of material implication such as the principle that a falsehood implies any proposition. This work culminated in his 1932 book &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; (with C. H. Langford), which introduced the five systems &quot;S1&quot; through &quot;S5&quot;.

After Lewis, modal logic received little attention for several decades. Nicholas Rescher has argued that this was because Bertrand Russell rejected it. However, Jan Dejnozka has argued against this view, stating that a modal system which Dejnozka calls &quot;MDL&quot; is described in Russell&#x27;s works, although Russell did believe the concept of modality to &quot;come from confusing propositions with propositional functions&quot;, as he wrote in &quot;The Analysis of Matter&quot;.

Ruth C. Barcan (later Ruth Barcan Marcus) developed the first axiomatic systems of quantified modal logic — first and second order extensions of Lewis&#x27; &quot;S2&quot;, &quot;S4&quot;, and &quot;S5&quot;. Arthur Norman Prior warned her to prepare well in the debates concerning quantified modal logic with Willard Van Orman Quine, because of bias against modal logic.

The contemporary era in modal semantics began in 1959, when Saul Kripke (then only a 18-year-old Harvard University undergraduate) introduced the now-standard Kripke semantics for modal logics. These are commonly referred to as &quot;possible worlds&quot; semantics. Kripke and A. N. Prior had previously corresponded at some length. Kripke semantics is basically simple, but proofs are eased using semantic-tableaux or analytic tableaux, as explained by E. W. Beth.

A. N. Prior created modern temporal logic, closely related to modal logic, in 1957 by adding modal operators [F] and [P] meaning &quot;eventually&quot; and &quot;previously&quot;. Vaughan Pratt introduced dynamic logic in 1976. In 1977, Amir Pnueli proposed using temporal logic to formalise the behaviour of continually operating concurrent programs. Flavors of temporal logic include propositional dynamic logic (PDL), (propositional) linear temporal logic (LTL), computation tree logic (CTL), Hennessy–Milner logic, and &quot;T&quot;.

The mathematical structure of modal logic, namely Boolean algebras augmented with unary operations (often called modal algebras), began to emerge with J. C. C. McKinsey&#x27;s 1941 proof that &quot;S2&quot; and &quot;S4&quot; are decidable, and reached full flower in the work of Alfred Tarski and his student Bjarni Jónsson (Jónsson and Tarski 1951–52). This work revealed that &quot;S4&quot; and &quot;S5&quot; are models of interior algebra, a proper extension of Boolean algebra originally designed to capture the properties of the interior and closure operators of topology. Texts on modal logic typically do little more than mention its connections with the study of Boolean algebras and topology. For a thorough survey of the history of formal modal logic and of the associated mathematics, see Robert Goldblatt (2006).

<text>Robert Delaunay (; 12 April 1885 – 25 October 1941) was a French artist of the School of Paris movement; who, with his wife Sonia Delaunay and others, co-founded the Orphism art movement, noted for its use of strong colours and geometric shapes. His later works were more abstract. His key influence related to bold use of colour and a clear love of experimentation with both depth and tone.

==Overview==
From 1912 to 1914, Delaunay&#x27;s nonfigurative paintings focused on color. His early paintings were deeply rooted in Neoimpressionism which he abandoned later. His writings on color, which were influenced by scientists and theoreticians, were largely intuitive and could sometimes be random statements based on the belief that color was a thing in itself, with its own powers of expression and form. He believed painting was a purely visual art that depended on intellectual elements, and perception was in the impact of colored light on the eye. 
His theories about color and light influenced many, among them artists and groups. such as Stanton Macdonald-Wright, Morgan Russell, Patrick Henry Bruce, Der Blaue Reiter, August Macke, Franz Marc, Paul Klee, and Lyonel Feininger. Art critic Guillaume Apollinaire was also influenced by Delaunay&#x27;s theories of color and quoted from them to explain Orphism, which he had named.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Robert Delaunay was born in Paris, the son of George Delaunay and Countess Berthe Félicie de Rose. While he was a child, Delaunay&#x27;s parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother&#x27;s sister Marie and her husband Charles Damour, in La Ronchère near Bourges. When he failed his final exam and said he wanted to become a painter, his uncle in 1902 sent him to Ronsin&#x27;s atelier to study Decorative Arts in the Belleville district of Paris.

===Career beginnings===
At age 19, Delaunay left Ronsin to focus entirely on painting and contributed six works to the Salon des Indépendants in 1904. He traveled to Brittany, where he was influenced by the group of Pont-Aven; and, in 1906, he contributed works he painted in Brittany to the 22nd Salon des Indépendants, where he met Henri Rousseau.

Delaunay formed a close friendship at this time with Jean Metzinger, with whom he shared an exhibition at a gallery run by Berthe Weill early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like &#x27;cubes&#x27; to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.
Robert Herbert writes: &quot;Metzinger&#x27;s Neo-Impressionist period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay... The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other (Art market, London, and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston) in prominent rectangles of pigment. (In the sky of &quot;Coucher de soleil no. 1&quot;, 1906–07, Collection Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, is the solar disk which Delaunay was later to make into a personal emblem).&quot; Herbert describes the vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger&#x27;s painting, and so too of Delaunay&#x27;s &quot;Paysage au disque&quot; (1906–07), as &quot;an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory...&quot;

Metzinger, followed closely by Delaunay—the two often painting together in 1906 and 1907—would develop a new sub-style of Neo-Impressionism that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Piet Mondrian developed a similar mosaic-like Divisionist technique circa 1909. The Futurists later (1909–1916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of Gino Severini&#x27;s Parisian works (from 1907 onward), into their dynamic paintings and sculpture.

In 1908, after a term in the military working as a regimental librarian, he met Sonia Terk; at the time she was married to a German art dealer whom she would soon divorce. In 1909, Delaunay began to paint a series of studies of the city of Paris and the Eiffel Tower, the &quot;Eiffel Tower&quot; series.

The following year, he married Terk, and the couple settled in a studio apartment in Paris, where their son Charles was born in January 1911. The same year, at the invitation of Wassily Kandinsky, Delaunay joined The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), a Munich-based group of artists. Delaunay was also successful in Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. He participated in the first Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and sold four works. Delaunay&#x27;s paintings encouraged an enthusiastic response with Blaue Reiter. The Blaue Reiter connections led to the article by Erwin von Busse titled &quot;Robert Delaunay&#x27;s Methods of Composition&quot;, which appeared in the 1912 &quot;Blaue Reiter Almanac&quot;. Delaunay would go to exhibit in February of that year, in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and Knave of Diamonds in Moscow.

&quot;This happened in 1912. Cubism was in full force. I made paintings that seemed like prisms compared to the Cubism my fellow artists were producing. I was the heretic of Cubism. I had great arguments with my comrades who banned color from their palette, depriving it of all elemental mobility. I was accused of returning to Impressionism, of making decorative paintings, etc.… I felt I had almost reached my goal.&quot;

1912 was a turning point for Delaunay. On 13 March his first major exhibition in Paris closed after two weeks at the Galerie Barbazanges. The exhibition, organized by the French mathematician and actuary Maurice Princet, showed forty-six works from his early 1906-07 Divisionist period to his Proto-Cubist and Cubist Eiffel Tower paintings from 1909 to 1912. Apollinaire praised those works of the exhibition and proclaimed Delaunay as &quot;an artist who has a monumental vision of the world.&quot;

In the 23 March 1912 issue of the satirical magazine &quot;L&#x27;Assiette au Beurre&quot;, the first published suggestion that Delaunay had broken with this group of Cubists appeared, in James Burkley&#x27;s review of the Salon des Indépendants. Burkley wrote, &quot;The &quot;Cubists&quot;, who occupied only a room, have multiplied. Their leaders, Picasso and Braque, have not participated in their grouping, and Delaunay, commonly labeled a Cubist, has wished to isolate himself and declares he has nothing in common with Metzinger or Le Fauconnier.&quot;

With Apollinaire, Delaunay traveled to Berlin in January 1913 for an exhibition of his work at Galerie Der Sturm. On their way back to Paris, the two stayed with August Macke in Bonn, where Macke introduced them to Max Ernst. When his painting &quot;La ville de Paris&quot; was rejected by the Armory Show as being too big he instructed Samuel Halpert to remove all his works from the show.

===Spanish and Portuguese years (1914–1920)===
At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Sonia and Robert were staying in Fontarabie in Spain. They decided not to return to France and settled in Madrid. In August 1915 they moved to Portugal where they shared a home with Samuel Halpert and Eduardo Viana. With Viana and their friends Amadeo de Souza Cardoso (whom the Delaunays had already met in Paris) and José de Almada Negreiros they discussed an artistic partnership. First declared a deserter, Robert was declared unfit for military duty at the French consulate in Vigo on 23 June 1916.

The Russian Revolution brought an end to the financial support Sonia received from her family in Russia, and a different source of income was needed. In 1917 the Delaunays met Sergei Diaghilev in Madrid. Robert designed the stage for his production of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (costume design by Sonia Delaunay). Robert Delaunay illustrates &quot;Tour Eiffel&quot; for Vicente Huidobro.

Paul Poiret refused a business partnership with Sonia in 1920, citing as one of the reasons her marriage to a deserter. The Der Sturm gallery in Berlin showed works by Sonia and Robert from their Portuguese period the same year.

===Return to Paris and later life (1921–1941)===

After the war, in 1921, they returned to Paris. Delaunay continued to work in both figurative and abstract themes, with a brief stint into Surrealism. Delaunay met André Breton and Tristan Tzara, who introduced him to both Dadaists and Surrealists. During the 1937 World Fair in Paris, Delaunay participated in the design of the railway and air travel pavilions.

When World War II erupted, the Delaunays moved to the Auvergne, in an effort to avoid the invading German forces. Suffering from cancer, Delaunay was unable to endure being moved around, and his health deteriorated. He died of cancer on 25 October 1941 in Montpellier at the age of 56. His body was reburied in 1952 in Gambais.

<doc id="333380" wikidata="Q7230229" url="?curid=333380" title="Pornography in the United States">
<text>Pornography has existed since the origins of the United States, and has become more readily accessible in the 21st century. Advanced by technological development, it has gone from a hard-to-find &quot;back alley&quot; item, beginning in 1969 with &quot;Blue Movie&quot; by Andy Warhol, the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984) and home video, to being more available in the country and later, starting in the 1990s, readily accessible to nearly anyone with a computer or other device connected to the Internet.

Attempts made to suppress it include: outright bans, prohibitions of its sale, censorship or rating schemes that restrict audience numbers, and claims that it is prostitution and thereby subject to regulations governing prostitution. Legal decisions affecting production and consumption of pornography include those relating to its definition, its relationship with prostitution, the definition of obscenity, rulings about personal possession of pornography, and its standing in relation to freedom of expression rights.

American advocates for pornography often cite the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech; however, under the Miller test established by &quot;Miller v. California&quot;, anything lacking &quot;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value&quot; is generally not protected. Several studies have found that the United States has been the largest producer of pornography.

==History==

Although pornography dates back thousands of years, its existence in the U.S. can be traced to its 18th-century origins and the influx of foreign trade and immigrants. By the end of the 18th century, France had become the leading country regarding the spread of porn pictures. Porn had become the subject of playing-cards, posters, post cards, and cabinet cards. Prior to this printers were previously limited to engravings, woodcuts, and line cuts for illustrations. As trade increased and more people immigrated from countries with less Puritanical and more relaxed attitudes toward human sexuality, the amount of available visual pornography increased.

In 1880, halftone printing was used to reproduce photographs inexpensively for the first time. The invention of halftone printing took pornography and erotica in new directions at the beginning of the 20th century. The new printing processes allowed photographic images to be reproduced easily in black and white.

The first porn daguerreotype appeared in 1850 and with the advent of &quot;moving pictures&quot; by the Lumière brothers the first porn film was made soon after the public exhibition of their creation. Pornographic film production commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture in 1895. Two of the earliest pioneers were Eugène Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner directed the earliest surviving pornographic film for Pirou under the trade name &quot;Léar&quot;. The 1896 film, &quot;Le Coucher de la Marie&quot; showed Louise Willy performing a striptease. Pirou&#x27;s film inspired a genre of risqué French films showing women disrobing and other filmmakers realized profits could be made from such films. In the United States, one of the Thomas Edison&#x27;s first efforts using his methods and equipment for making moving pictures was of a nude woman getting up from her bath tub and running away.

In the 20th century, the era of &quot;blue movies&quot; began with the silent films of the 1920s and continued throughout the post-war era as film technology improved and equipment costs were reduced to a consumer affordable level. Particularly with the introduction of the 8mm and super-8 film gauges, popular for the home movie market. Until the advent of electronic and digital video technology, the mass production of pornographic films was tied directly to the mainstream film industry. Beginning in 1969 with &quot;Blue Movie&quot; by Andy Warhol, the subsequent Golden Age of Porn and more permissive legislation, a rise of adult theaters in the United States, and many other countries, developed. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated &quot;movie booths&quot; in sex shops that displayed pornographic &quot;loops&quot; (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).

By 1982, pornographic film production had switched to the cheaper and more convenient medium of video tape. Many film directors were hesitant to switch because of the different image quality that video tape produced. Those who did make the change benefited from greater profits since consumers preferred the new format. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people&#x27;s private homes. This was the end of the age of big budget productions and the beginning of the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since video production was inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands of videos were including compilations of just the sex scenes from various titles.

In the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on DVD. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format and allowed innovations such as &quot;interactive&quot; videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.

The introduction and widespread availability of the Internet further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously videos would be rented or purchased through mail-order, but with the Internet people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).

As of the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. Of late, web-cams and webcams recordings are again expanding the market. Thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers&#x27; demand while often making money per view.

By the 2010s, the fortunes of the pornography industry had changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by streaming media delivery over the Internet, competition from pirate, amateur, and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size.

==Publication==

===Print===
American adult magazines which have the widest distribution do not violate the Miller test and can be legally distributed. Adult magazines have been largely put into mainstream by the pioneer &quot;Playboy&quot;. However, during the so-called Pubic Wars in the 1960s and 1970s &quot;Penthouse&quot; established itself as a more explicit magazine. &quot;Screw&quot; moved the bar toward hardcore when it first came out in 1968 and with &quot;Hustler&quot; appearing in 1974 the move to hardcore was complete. By the mid-1990s magazines like &quot;Playboy&quot; had become noncompetitive and even hardcore publications like &quot;Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Hustler&quot; struggled. According to Laura Kipnis, a cultural theorist and critic, &quot;the &quot;Hustler&quot; body is an unromanticized body—no vaselined lens or soft focus: this is neither the airbrushed top-heavy fantasy body of &quot;Playboy&quot;, nor the ersatz opulence, the lingeried and sensitive crotch shots of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, transforming female genitals into &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;. It&#x27;s a body, not a surface or a suntan: insistently material, defiantly vulgar, corporeal&quot;.

Many adult magazines in the United States are usually sold wrapped to avoid incidental viewing by minors and are now highlighted by special features or themes. For instance, a primarily softcore magazine, &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, focuses on models between 18 and 23 years of age. &quot;Hustler&#x27;s Leg World&quot; is focused on the female legs and feet. &quot;Perfect 10&quot; publishes images of women untouched by plastic surgery or airbrushing.

Pornographic bookstores have been subject to U.S. zoning laws.

===Movies and pay-per-view===

Much of the pornography produced in the United States is in the form of movies and the branch acutely competes with the Internet. The market is very diverse and ranges from the mainstream heterosexual content to the rarefied S/M, BDSM, interracial sex, ethnic, etc. through enduringly popular gay porn.

Early American stag films included &quot;Wonders of the Unseen World&quot; (1927), &quot;An Author&#x27;s True Story&quot; (1933), &quot;Goodyear&quot; (1950s), &quot;Smart Alec&quot; (1951), and &quot;Playmates&quot; (1956–58). Breakthrough films, such as 1969&#x27;s &quot;Blue Movie&quot; by Andy Warhol, 1972&#x27;s &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; and 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; by Radley Metzger, launched the so-called &quot;porno chic&quot; phenomenon in the United States and enabled the commercialization of the adult film industry. In this period America&#x27;s most notorious pornographer was Reuben Sturman. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, throughout the 1970s, Sturman controlled most of the pornography circulating in the country.

The country now houses over 40 adult movies studios featuring heterosexual scenes, more than any other country. The branch, according to founder and president of &quot;Adult Video News&quot; Paul Fishbein, involves the manufacturers of adult products, distributors, suppliers, retail store owners, wholesalers, distributors, cable TV buyers, and foreign buyers. The production is concentrated in San Fernando Valley (mainly in Chatsworth, Reseda and Van Nuys) and Las Vegas, where more than 200 adult entertainment companies gather to network and show off their latest wares. The world&#x27;s largest adult movies studio, Vivid Entertainment, generates an estimated $100 million a year in revenue, distributing 60 films annually and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems, and on the Internet. Vivid&#x27;s two largest regional competitors are Wicked Pictures and Digital Playground. Boulder Colorado-based New Frontier Media, a leading distributor of adult movies (at NASDAQ since November 2000), is one of the two adult video companies traded publicly, the other one being Spanish Private Media Group.

The industry&#x27;s decision to embrace VHS in the early 1980s, for example, helped to do away with Sony Betamax, despite the latter format&#x27;s superior quality. Video rentals soared from just under 80 million in 1985 to half-billion by 1993. Suffering at the hands of video warez tended not be publicly stressed by country&#x27;s film industry. In 1999 there were 711 million rentals of hardcore films. 11,300 hardcore films were released in 2002.
In the recent years, according to Fishbein, there are well over 800 million rentals of adult videotapes and DVDs in video stores across the country. Digital Playground said it is choosing the Blu-ray Disc for all of its &quot;interactive&quot; films because of its greater capacity.

The female demographic is considered to be the biggest catalyst for pornographic cultural crossover. According to Adella O&#x27;Neal, a Digital Playground publicist, in 2000 roughly 9% of the company&#x27;s consumers were women while four years later that figure has bloomed to 53%.

American adult pay-per-view television is presently unregulated since it is not technically &quot;broadcasting&quot; as defined in the Federal Communications Act. Cable and satellite television networks host about six main adult-related channels. Most of them (particularly Playboy TV, Penthouse TV, and Hustler TV (there is also a &quot;Hustler Video&quot;, a line of raunchy films created by Larry Flynt)) are maintained by three mainstream porn magazines. In 1999 Playboy Enterprises sold to Vivid Entertainment a small channel which was renamed to Hot Network. Since that Vivid launched two more channels—the Hot Zone and Vivid TV. The viewers paid close to $400 million a year to tune into Vivid&#x27;s hardcore content and the company soon overtook Playboy as operator of the world&#x27;s largest adult-TV network. However, after passing the 2000 &quot;United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group&quot; case Playboy bought all three networks from Vivid in 2001 and folded them into &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Spice&quot; brand. Operators then shunned &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Spice Platinum&quot;, a new group of channels with graphic hardcore fare.

Some subsidiaries of major corporations are the largest pornography sellers, like News Corporation&#x27;s DirecTV. Comcast, the nation&#x27;s largest cable company, once pulled in $50 million from adult programming. Revenues of companies such as Playboy and Hustler were small by comparison.

===Video games and comics===
Microsoft has long declined to license development software to game makers whose titles include sexual content. Wal-Mart, America&#x27;s largest distributor of video games, maintains the policy of selling no games with an AO rating. However, in recent years the pornographic content in video games has been promoted particularly by Playboy. &quot;&quot; became the first game built around the &quot;Playboy&quot; license.

A downloadable mod—&quot;Hot Coffee&quot; for the game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; brought attention to the need to discuss the challenges faced in creating games with pornographic content. Meanwhile, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; was pulled from shelves by Rockstar Games after it became public knowledge that, with the use of a Gameshark cheating device, the scene could be unlocked portraying the protagonist having sex with another character, although in the scene both characters have their clothes on. The game was later sold without the unlockable scene.

PlayStation 2 video game &quot;God of War&quot; (2005), based on Greek mythology, features an event in the first part of the game where protagonist Kratos can have sex with two topless prostitutes, who reside in a bedroom on his boat. Although no sexual acts are depicted (they occur off-screen and are indicated by sound effects), the women are shown topless. The player interacts by performing button and joystick commands that appear on screen which results in an experience reward for the player. This type of sex mini-game became a prominent feature for the &quot;God of War&quot; series, being included in its sequels &quot;God of War II&quot; (2007), &quot;God of War: Chains of Olympus&quot; (2008), &quot;God of War III&quot; (2010), and &quot;God of War: Ghost of Sparta&quot; (2010), with the latter being the final game to feature it.

The adult sections of American comic book stores frequently carry a large number of translations of Japanese hardcore comics, as well as an increasing number of home imitations.

One of the Japanese animation porn movies, which started the American adult video market, was &quot;Urotsukidoji&quot;. The adult animation market exists primarily through direct sales: mail-order to customers, and wholesale to specialty shops which cater to animation and to comic-book fans. The legal framework in both countries regarding the regulation of obscene and pornographic material is overall rather similar.

===Internet===

The Internet maintains a significant part of American adult entertainment, also because the 1997 &quot;Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union&quot; case specified that the term &quot;&quot; has no specific legal meaning in the context of the Internet. More recent federal efforts, such as the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 expressly addressed the Internet. On May 1, 2000, American Express announced it would no longer cover transactions from adult sites. According to the committee to Study Tools and Strategies for Protecting Kids from Pornography and Their Applicability to Other Inappropriate Internet Content, there are over 100,000 subscription sites with adult content in the United States, with each site having multiple web pages. On average, a paid subscription generates $20 to $40 per month in revenue, however, an in-depth analysis is complicated. If a visitor site connects to a pay site and signs up for content, it receives a conversion fee from the larger site. A successful large operation is often an umbrella company serving many markets with pay sites. Around this core and its affiliates is a system of ad-supported service sites. The so-called portable porn market is in its initial stage in the U.S.

In 2000 the owners and operators of Playgirl.com and scores of other adult sites were charged by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with illegally billing thousands of consumers for services that were advertised as free, and for billing other consumers who never visited the web sites at all. Nevadan Voice Media Incorporated, which ran several adult sites, was also charged by the commission. Sites often suffer from unauthorized, non-paying surfers who use stolen passwords, which can use months&#x27; worth of bandwidth in a day, costing the site operator hundreds or thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of additional bandwidth fees, all for traffic that returns no money at all. The 2002 &quot;Paragon Electric Co., Inc. v. Buy This Domain&quot; case ruled that linking domain names to pornographic sites is not per se conclusive of bad-faith registration and use, although it does raise that presumption.

A common occurrence was the use of domain names similar to known ones, such as whitehouse.com (unrelated to whitehouse.gov), which for some period featured explicit content. The use of expired domains is also common, along with typosquatting, which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser.

==Economics==
In 1975, the total retail value of all the hardcore pornography in the U.S. was estimated at $5–10 million. The 1979 Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that &quot;in Los Angeles alone, the pornography business does $100 million a year in gross retail volume&quot; while &quot;the average pornography magazine sells for between $6 and $10 each&quot;. According to the 1986 Attorney General&#x27;s Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine. The total income of modern country&#x27;s adult entertainment is often rated at $10–13 billion, of which $4–6 billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by Forrester Research and was lowered in 1998. In 2007 The Observer newspaper also gave a figure of $13 billion. Other sources, quoted by &quot;Forbes&quot; (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, and IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, web sites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys, and magazines) mention the $2.6–3.9 billion figure (without the cellphone component). &quot;USA Today&quot; claimed in 2003 that websites such as Danni&#x27;s Hard Drive and Cybererotica.com generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time. The adult movies income (from sale and rent) was once estimated by AVN Publications at $4.3 billion but how this figure was determined is unclear. According to the 2001 Forbes data the annual income distribution is like this:
&quot;The Online Journalism Review&quot;, published by the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California, weighed in with an analysis that favored &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; number. The financial extent of adult films, distributed in hotels, is hard to estimate—hotels keep statistics to themselves or do not keep them at all. A CBS News investigation in November 2003 claimed that 50% of guests at the Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, Sheraton, and Holiday Inn hotel chains purchased adult movies, contributing to 70% of in-room profits. The income of cellphone porn is low, when compared with other countries. The absence of V-chip-style parental controls on other equipment has obviated the need for American consumers to use cellphones to access explicit content.

==Legality==

The definition of pornography in the U.S. evolved through decades, from the 1960s. In this period, recognizing ambiguities, the term &quot;sexually explicit content&quot; gained use as one of the pornography&#x27;s euphemisms, but later it was determined that a distinction between pornographic and sexually explicit content is completely artificial. In &quot;Miller v. California&quot; the Supreme Court used the definition of pornography made by &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; of 1969 (&quot;a depiction (as in a writing or painting) of or : a portrayal of erotic behavior designed to cause sexual excitement&quot;). &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; followed the &quot;Miller&quot; test and defined pornography as material that taken as a whole the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find appealing to the interest. &quot;Heinle&#x27;s Newbury House Dictionary of American English&quot; (2003) defined pornography as &quot;obscene writings, pictures, or films intended to arouse sexual desire&quot;.

The Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance defined pornography as the &quot;graphic sexually explicit subordination of women, whether in pictures or in words&quot;. The ordinance was ruled unconstitutional by the Federal Appeals Court in &quot;American Booksellers v. Hudnut&quot; in Indianapolis (1985). Courts in California and New York have clearly rejected the argument that the making of pornography is prostitution. (See &quot;California v. Freeman&quot; (1988) and &quot;People v. Paulino&quot; (2005).) The Oregon Supreme Court went even further in &quot;State v. Henry&quot; (1987) by abolishing the legal definition of obscenity in that state, ruling it violated freedom of speech as defined in the state constitution.

Pornography as a legal term at the federal level, except the generic terms &quot;hardcore pornography&quot; and &quot;child pornography&quot;, has not existed since the 1973 &quot;Miller v. California&quot; case. The United States Supreme Court in &quot;Miller v. California&quot; held that one type of pornography, namely obscenity, does not enjoy First Amendment protection, but recognized that individual communities had different values and opinions on obscenity. The Court defines obscenity in accordance with the Miller test. Since then several states have enacted laws that apply that test. Relying on the 1930 Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act and under the terms &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection prohibits the importation of any pornographic material ( &quot;Immoral articles; importation prohibited&quot;).

===Pornography as prostitution===
Attempts were made in the United States in the 1970s to close down the pornography industry by prosecuting those in the industry on prostitution charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of &quot;People v. Freeman&quot;. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely &quot;portraying&quot; a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the United States Supreme Court making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.

===Origin of term===
The term &quot;pornography&quot; first appeared in an 1857 British medical dictionary, which defined it as &quot;a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene&quot;, therefore pornography by itself was not a widely used term in nineteenth-century America and the term did not appear in any version of &quot;American Dictionary of the English Language&quot; in its early editions. The dictionary introduced the entry in 1864, defining it primarily as a &quot;treatment of, or a treatise on, the subject of prostitutes or prostitution&quot;. Early charges used the term &quot;obscenity&quot; as well as after &quot;Miller v. California&quot;, though the term &quot;pornography&quot; remained as a reference entry:

The censorship of pornographic materials in the United States was enabled by the way courts interpreted the First, and partially Ninth and Fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The legal justification also includes the so-called harm principle, as in Canada and the United Kingdom. The absolutist interpretation of the First Amendment as applied to pornography has never been sustained by the Supreme Court. In the &quot;Investigation of Literature Allegedly Containing Objectionable Material&quot;, issued by the U.S. Congress Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1953, it was noted that &quot;perhaps the greatest impediments to the prompt and effective enforcement of existing laws intended to control pornographic materials are the difficulties of establishing a precise interpretation of the word&quot;. During the Warren Court (1953–1969), the first notable court to face the cases of such kind, justices Potter Stewart, Byron White, and Arthur Goldberg shared the opinion that only hardcore pornography was not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This position was contested notably by U.S. Solicitor General James Lee Rankin (in office 1956–1961), but in Jacobellis v. Ohio Stewart concluded that criminal obscenity laws are constitutionally limited under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to hardcore pornography. Concurring in the 1957 &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that &quot;even assuming that pornography cannot be deemed ever to cause, in an immediate sense, criminal sexual conduct, other interests within the proper cognizance of the States may be protected by the prohibition placed on such materials.&quot;

The 1967 Public Law 90-100 found the traffic in pornography to be &quot;a matter of national concern&quot;, as well as in obscenity. In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 &quot;Ginzburg v. United States&quot; case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice Hugo Black in the 1966 &quot;Mishkin v. New York&quot;: &quot;I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read.&quot; In the 1974 &quot;Hamling v. United States&quot; decision the Supreme Court said that just because pornographic materials are for sale and purchased around the country, &quot;Mere availability of similar materials by itself means nothing more than that other persons are engaged in similar activities.&quot; The 1976 &quot;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot; defined that pornography consists of &quot;written, graphic, or other forms of communication intended to excite lascivious feelings&quot;. Since determining what is pornography and what is &quot;soft core&quot; and &quot;hard core&quot; are subjective questions to judges, juries, and law enforcement officials, it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow. The Rehnquist Court further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography. Current Chief Justice John Roberts told at the confirmation hearing on his nomination: &quot;Well, Senator, it&#x27;s my understanding under the Supreme Court&#x27;s doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography and what is entitled to protection under the First Amendment and what is not&quot;.

The famous Indianapolis definition of pornography by Dworkin and MacKinnon paralleled their Minneapolis ordinance. The first was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for several reasons. The ordinance did not use any of the accepted terms that the Supreme Court had developed over time for determining when material is obscene, including &quot;prurient interest&quot;, &quot;offensiveness&quot;, or &quot;local community standards&quot;. Another concern was the way the women were depicted in the work. If women were referred to in the approved fashion stressing equality, the activity involved would be regardless of how sexually explicit it was. The Court also indicated that if women were referred to in a disapproving way depicting them as subversive or as enjoying humiliation, the activity would be unlawful regardless of the &quot;literary, artistic or political qualities of the work taken as a whole&quot;. Judge Frank Easterbrook said: &quot;We accept the premises of this legislation. Depictions of subordination tend to perpetuate subordination. The subordinate status of women in turn leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and injury at home, battery and rape on the streets... Yet this simply demonstrates the power of pornography as speech.&quot; &quot;Conceptions of Democracy in American Constitutional Argument: The Case of Pornography Regulation&quot; by Frank Michelman, issued by Tennessee Law Review (vol. 56, no. 291, 1989) partially consented that &quot;pornography is political expression in that it promulgates a certain view of women&#x27;s natures and thus of women&#x27;s appropriate relations and treatment in society&quot;, but also concluded that the Indianapolis ordinance was precisely designed to suppress that particular view by censoring pornography. Minneapolis ordinance was struck down on the grounds that it was ambiguous and vague, however, despite its failure the proposal influenced other communities across the United States.

In May 2005 U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales established an Obscenity Prosecution Task Force. The task force, according to a Department of Justice news release on May 5, was &quot;dedicated to the investigation and prosecution of the distributors of hard-core pornography that meets the test for obscenity, as defined by the United States Supreme Court.&quot; Under President Bush&#x27;s and Gonzales&#x27; rationales the FBI Adult Obscenity Squad was recruited in August 2005 to gather evidence against &quot;manufacturers and purveyors&quot; of adult pornography.

===Child pornography===

The 1970 Lockhart Commission recommended eliminating all criminal penalties for pornography except for pornographic depictions of minors, or sale of pornography to minors. However, prior to 1977, only two states had laws which prohibited the use of children in the production or distribution of pornographic materials or performances. In 1977, the Department of Justice strongly endorsed legislation which banned the production and dissemination of child pornography. These efforts have been unsuccessfully challenged in the 1982 &quot;New York v. Ferber&quot; case (&quot;The States are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children...&quot;). Although the states have a different age of consent, in accordance with the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 all models featured in pornographic content should be at least 18 years of age. This kind of material is often labeled as &quot;adult&quot; and the appropriate disclaimers are common. They are based on what &quot;depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs&quot;.

Acts and attempted acts pertaining to child pornography became generally unlawful at the federal level in 1984, with the passage of the Child Protection Act, and have largely remained such ever since. It is a federal crime to possess, distribute, or produce non-fictional child pornography and carries large fines and prison sentences of up to 30 years upon conviction and requirement to register as a sex offender. Digitally produced child pornography is also unlawful, provided that the material is practically indistinguishable from child pornography.
=== Animal crush fetish pornography ===
Animal crush fetish pornography was the second form of pornography, other than child pornography, to become unlawful at federal level. This prohibition was first enacted into law on December 3, 1999. However, over ten years later, that initial law was found unconstitutional in United States v. Stevens (2010). In response, Congress passed the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010. The Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010 merely made the distribution of animal crush fetish pornography illegal, but not the underlying acts of animal cruelty depicted. In 2019, the PACT Act amended the existing statute and made the underlying acts unlawful.

=== Video voyeurism pornography ===
Video voyeurism was the third form of pornography, other than child pornography and animal crush fetish pornography, to become categorically unlawful at the federal level. It became federally illegal in the United States with the passage of the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004.

=== Revenge pornography ===
Revenge porn, that is, pornography distributed for purposes of retaliation, has long been an issue in the United States. While not criminally unlawful at the federal law, in 2022, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, a private right of action was established to enable the victims of revenge pornography to seek redress for the damage sustained as a result.

==Anti-pornography movement==

An anti-pornography movement has existed in the United States since before the 1969 Supreme Court decision of &quot;Stanley v. Georgia&quot;, which held that people could view whatever they wished in the privacy of their own homes, by establishing an implied &quot;right to privacy&quot; in U.S. law. This led President Lyndon B. Johnson, with the backing of Congress, to appoint a commission to study pornography. The anti-pornography movement seeks to maintain or restore restrictions and to increase or create restrictions on the production, sale or dissemination of pornography.

Jesuit priest Father Morton A. Hill (1917–1985) was a leader of the campaign against pornography in the United States in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He was one of the founders of Morality in Media, which was created in 1962 to fight pornography. Morality in Media was launched by an interfaith group of clergy and Hill was president until his death in 1985. Morality in Media continues with Patrick A. Trueman, a registered federal lobbyist, as president.

So prominent was Hill on the issue, that in 1969 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to the President&#x27;s Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. Father Hill and another clergyman on the commission, Dr. Winfrey C. Link, believed that the commission was stacked with supporters of loosening laws on pornography, and issued the Hill-Link Minority Report rebutting the conclusions of the majority report, which held that pornography should be decriminalized as there were no links between it and criminal behavior. The majority report was widely criticized and rejected by Congress. The Senate rejected the commission&#x27;s findings and recommendations by a 60–5 vote, with 34 abstentions. President Nixon, who had succeeded Johnson in 1969, also emphatically rejected the majority report. The Hill-Link Minority Report, on the other hand, which recommended maintaining anti-obscenity statutes, was read into the record of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It was cited by the Burger Court in its 1973 obscenity decisions, including &quot;Miller v. California&quot;.

==Notes==
a In the 1969 &quot;Stanley v. Georgia&quot; case (later followed by the 1971 &quot;United States v. Reidel&quot;), the Supreme Court ruled that private possession of pornography (except child pornography as determined in 1990 by a 6 to 3 decision) in the home was not a crime, nor was it subject to government regulation. Technically why people have a constitutional right to watch hardcore pornography privately has never been explained, but in the 1973 &quot;Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton&quot; Chief Justice Burger wrote: &quot;We categorically disapprove the theory, apparently adopted by the trial judge, that obscene, pornographic films acquire constitutional immunity from state regulation simply because they are exhibited for consenting adults only. This holding was properly rejected by the Georgia Supreme Court.&quot; &quot;Miller v. California&quot; held 5–4 that the state may outlaw the showing of hardcore pornographic films, even if the &quot;adult theatre&quot; is clearly labeled and warns.

b. Sex tourism involving persons under 18 outside the U.S. is also illegal.

c. The term &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; was used at the federal level e.g. by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, but it was partially voided by federal courts over subsequent years. Another term usage includes the 1996 &quot;Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. Federal Communications Commission&quot; certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

d The transportation of pornography in interstate commerce was banned in the 1973 case of &quot;United States v. Orito&quot;. The Supreme Court upheld zoning restrictions that either quarantine or disperse pornography merchants, leaving it to local officials to determine whether local interests are best served by restricting all porn merchants to a single district. Though the Court has also upheld zoning that prohibits pornographic entertainment within a certain distance of a school, the legitimate primary purpose excludes the preventing of access by minors which can be achieved much more directly by simple restrictions. On May 13, 2002, writing for the majority in &quot;Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union&quot;, Justice Clarence Thomas stated that using community standards to identify material that could be harmful to minors does not make the law overly broad and therefore unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

e Utah uses the legal term &quot;pornography&quot; for the same illegal sexually explicit material.

<doc id="333381" wikidata="Q2723974" url="?curid=333381" title="Low whistle">
<text>The low whistle, or concert whistle, is a variation of the traditional tin whistle/pennywhistle, distinguished by its lower pitch and larger size. It is most closely associated with the performances of British and Irish artists such as Tommy Makem, Finbar Furey and his son Martin Furey, Old Blind Dogs, Michael McGoldrick, &quot;Riverdance&quot;, Lunasa, Donie Keyes, Chris Conway, and Davy Spillane, and is increasingly accepted as a feature of Celtic music.

The low whistle is often used for the playing of airs and slow melodies due to its haunting and delicate sound. However, it is also becoming used more often for the playing of jigs, reels and hornpipes from the Irish, Scottish, Manx, Welsh, and English traditions. A reason put forward for this being, it&#x27;s easier to produce some ornamentation on the whistle, due to the size of the finger holes.

The most common low whistle is the &quot;Low D&quot;, pitched one octave below the traditional D whistle. A whistle is generally classed as a &quot;low&quot; whistle if its lowest note is the G above middle C or lower. Whistles higher than this are termed &quot;soprano&quot; or &quot;high&quot; whistles when a distinction is necessary. Low whistles operate on the same principles, and are generally fingered in the same way as traditional pennywhistles although for many, a &quot;piper&#x27;s grip&quot; may be required due to the distance between the holes. They belong to the same woodwind instrument family of end-blown fipple flutes.

Though the tone of this instrument varies subtly among makers, low whistles are generally characterized by a more breathy, flute-like sound than traditional tin whistles.

==Early history==
While the precise history of the low whistle is often debated, it is known that various kinds of vertical fipple flutes have existed in antiquity. The fipple flutes developed during the 16th century were the ancestors of today&#x27;s low whistle, carrying through from early transverse flutes the six-holed design tradition and conical bore shape. They were originally of wooden construction, but the late 17th century saw more extensive use of metals such as brass and nickel. The metal was usually rolled and soldered, and further developments included the use of a tuning slide. These metal vertical flutes were found throughout Ireland, Britain, the Scandinavian peninsula, Canada, and Flanders.

==The modern low whistle==
English flute maker and jazz musician Bernard Overton (1930-2008) is credited with producing the first modern low whistle in late 1971, which he made with Finbar Furey after Furey&#x27;s prized Indian bamboo whistle was destroyed while on tour. Unable to repair it, Overton attempted to produce a metal replica and Finbar and himself spent many hours in the shed at the back of Bernard&#x27;s house in Rugby, designing, testing and ultimately perfecting the flute. The first few were named the Furey/Overton flute but when Bernard gave up his job to hand make them full-time, they decided to market them as The Overton Flute. The first resulting instrument was essentially an oversized tin whistle made of copper pipe with a wooden plug but was quickly replaced by the aluminium one. While Overton was unsatisfied with its performance, he subsequently refined the design with an all-aluminium construction, producing a whistle in A. Impressed, Finbar requested a G version for his trademark &quot;Lonesome Boatman&quot; performances. Later, according to Overton,

Hence, the expression &quot;Irish low whistle&quot; is not denoting an Irish origin, but just an intensive use of this instrument in Ireland and, because of cultural similarity, in the whole British archipelago. While before long several notable instrument makers were producing low whistles, it is usually the Riverdance tour of the 1990s that is credited with giving the low whistle commercial exposure and recognition outside traditional music circles. Of particular note is Davy Spillane, whose work in fusing the sound of traditional instruments such as the low whistle with modern jazz or RnB, for example, has done much for the instrument&#x27;s visibility. Some of the most famous low whistle players are: Michael McGoldrick, Kevin Crawford, Phil Hardy from England, Davy Spillane, Paddy Keenan, John McSherry (musician) from Ireland, Brian Finnegan from Northern Ireland, Fred Morrison, Rory Campbell (musician), Tony Hinnigan, and Ross Ainslie from Scotland. In rock music, the multi-instrumentalist Troy Donockley occasionally plays a low whistle with the symphonic metal band Nightwish.

===In British and Irish culture and traditional music===
Unlike the regular pennywhistle, the low whistle is a relative newcomer to folk music, and some criticise it for attempting to fill a musical role already well served by the tin whistle and Irish flute. To others it is viewed as a &quot;transition instrument&quot; for players seeking to eventually learn the seemingly more prestigious (and expensive) flute or uilleann pipes. While it is true that many skills learnt on the low whistle carry over to these instruments, &quot;some of the greatest players of traditional music have been associated with the low whistle&quot; and have helped foster its reputation as a highly versatile and respected instrument in its own right, with a unique and evocative sound. Much like the Irish flat-backed bouzouki, the low whistle can be seen as a product of a period when experiments in instrumentation were commonplace in traditional music, and musicians sought diverse and innovative means of expression.

<text>In agriculture, a pulper is a machine designed to remove pulp (i.e. the soft flesh) from agricultural produce. For example, in coffee growing, the ripe red cherries are picked from the coffee bushes and, before fermentation and later drying, the soft pulp needs to be removed (otherwise a potentially uncontrollable fermentation/rot will occur). In the case of coffee, the pulping is normally done in a pulper that is either hand-cranked or engine-driven; the beans come into contact with a rotating spiked drum that removes the pulp or flesh. The sticky beans that result from this process then have to be washed, fermented, washed again and dried, before further processing (milling to remove the parchment) and then roasting.

In paper making, a pulper is a machine that produces pulp from cellulose fibres; this pulp can directly be used by a paper machine.
In fufu powder making, a pulper is a machine that is used to pulp the fermented cassava to remove Fibre before sedimentation.

Post-consumer waste is re-pulped, in one of the processes involved in recycling it.

<text>Arthur Hiller, (November 22, 1923 – August 17, 2016) was a Canadian television and film director with over 33 films to his credit during a 50-year career. He began his career directing television in Canada and later in the U.S. By the late 1950s, he was directing films, most often comedies, but also dramas and romantic subjects, such as in &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), which was nominated for seven Oscars.

Hiller collaborated on films with screenwriters Paddy Chayefsky and Neil Simon. Among his other films were &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964), &quot;Tobruk&quot; (1967), &quot;The Hospital&quot; (1971), &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1970), &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; (1975), &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), &quot;The In-Laws&quot; (1979), &quot;Making Love&quot; (1982), and &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1987).

Hiller served as president of the Directors Guild of America from 1989 to 1993 and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1993 to 1997. He was the recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2002. An annual film festival in Hiller&#x27;s honor was held from 2006 until 2009 at his alma mater, Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts.

==Early life and military service==
Hiller was born in November 1923 in Edmonton, Alberta, the son of Rose (Garfin) and Harry Hiller. His family was Jewish, and had emigrated from Poland in 1912. He had two sisters, one 13 years older and one 11 years older. His father operated a second-hand musical instruments store in Edmonton. Hiller recalled that when he occasionally traveled home while he was in college, the black people he met with &quot;treated me like a king. Why? Because they loved my father. They told me that unlike other shopkeepers, he treated them like normal folks when they went to his store. He didn&#x27;t look down on them&quot;.

Although his parents were not professionals in theater or had much money, notes Hiller, they enjoyed putting on a Jewish play once or twice a year for the Jewish community of 450 people, mainly to keep in touch with their heritage. Hiller recalls they started up the Yiddish theater when he was seven or eight years old; he helped set carpenters build and decorate the sets. When he was eleven, he got a role acting as an old man, wearing a long beard and the payot. He says that &quot;the love of theater and music and literature my parents instilled in me&quot; contributed to his later choosing to direct TV and films.

After he graduated from high school, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1941 during World War II. He served with 427 Lion Squadron as a navigator on four-engine Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers flying from Leeming, Yorkshire on Operations over Nazi-controlled territory in Europe. 

After he returned from serving in the military, Hiller enrolled in and later graduated from University College, Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts in 1947. After Israel was declared a state in 1948, he and his wife unsuccessfully tried to join the Israeli army because the country came under attack. 

Hiller returned to college and earned a Master of Arts in psychology in 1950. One of his early jobs, after graduating, was with Canadian radio directing various public affairs programs.

==Directing career==
Hiller began his career as a television director with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. NBC, one of the main networks in the United States, seeing his work in Canada, offered him positions directing television dramas. Over the next few years, his work for the small screen included episodes of &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman, Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, Perry Mason, and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

===1950s–1960s===
Hiller directed his first film, &quot;The Careless Years&quot; (1957), the story of a young couple eloping developed by Bryna Productions. This was followed by &quot;This Rugged Land&quot; (1962), originally made for television but then released as a film, and then &quot;Miracle of the White Stallions&quot; (1963), a Walt Disney Productions film. With these first films, Hiller already showed competence in directing unrelated subjects successfully.

He next directed a satirical anti-war comedy by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964), starring James Garner and Julie Andrews. It was the first of two film collaborations with Chayefsky. The film, nominated for two Academy Awards, would establish Hiller as a notable Hollywood director and, according to critics, &quot;earned him a reputation for flair with sophisticated comedy.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther wrote that Hiller&#x27;s &quot;brisk direction&quot; of Chayefsky&#x27;s script included some &quot;remarkably good writing with some slashing irreverence.&quot;

In 1964 Hiller also directed the first episode of the television series &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. This was followed by the comedy &quot;Promise Her Anything&quot; (1965), with Warren Beatty and Leslie Caron and &quot;Penelope&quot; (1966), starring Natalie Wood. In a move away from comedy, he directed the desert warfare drama, &quot;Tobruk&quot; (1967), starring Rock Hudson and George Peppard, about a North African Campaign during World War II. The film was nominated for one Academy Award and showed Hiller capable of handling action films as well as comedy. Around the same time, he returned to comedy with &quot;The Tiger Makes Out&quot; (also 1967), starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, and featured Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s film debut. &quot;Popi&quot; (1969), recounts the tale of a Puerto Rican widower, starring Alan Arkin, struggling to raise his two young sons in the New York City neighborhood known as Spanish Harlem. Arkin was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.

===1970s===
Hiller directed &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), his best known work and most successful at the box-office. The film stars Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Ali MacGraw in a romantic tragedy, and it was nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Director. The American Film Institute ranks it No. 9 in their list of the greatest love stories. Critic Roger Ebert disagreed with some critics who felt the story was too contrived: &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t we get a little misty during a story about young lovers separated by death? Hiller earns our emotional response because of the way he&#x27;s directed the movie...The movie is mostly about life, however, not death. And because Hiller makes the lovers into individuals, of course we&#x27;re moved by the film&#x27;s conclusion. Why not?&quot;

The following year Hiller again collaborated with screenwriter Paddy Chayevsky in directing &quot;The Hospital&quot; (1971), a satire starring George C. Scott which has been described as being his best film. It is a black comedy about disillusionment and chaos within a hospital setting. Chayevsky received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In directing the film, Hiller tried to create a sense of action and movement by keeping the camera mobile and using handheld cameras as much as possible. His goal was to have the camera reflect the chaos and confusion taking place in the hospital. &quot;I&#x27;ve always liked that sort of realistic feel,&quot; he states. &quot;I wanted the feeling that the audience was peeking around the corner.&quot;

Hiller directed two comedy films in collaboration with playwright Neil Simon. The first film was &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1970), starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, who were both nominated for Golden Globe awards for their roles. Their next collaboration was &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), starring Walter Matthau, which was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture. Both films were driven by intense comedy dialogue and were considered &quot;crisply directed&quot; by reviewers.

Hiller returned to directing serious drama with &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; (1975), starring Maximilian Schell, in a screen adaptation of a stage play written by Robert Shaw. Schell played the role of a man trying to deal with questions of self-identity and guilt as a survivor of the Holocaust during World War II. For his highly emotional role, Schell was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award.

Returning to comedy, Hiller directed &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), starring Gene Wilder, Jill Clayburgh and
Richard Pryor. The film was well received by critics and is rated No. 95 on the AFI&#x27;s best comedy films. He directed another comedy, &quot;The In-Laws&quot; (1979), with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, which was also a critical and commercial success.

===1980s===
Hiller directed the film &quot;Making Love&quot;, which was released in February 1982, a story of a married man coming to terms with his homosexuality. &quot;Author! Author!&quot; (also 1982), starred Al Pacino. The following year Hiller directed &quot;Romantic Comedy&quot; (1983), starring Dudley Moore and Mary Steenburgen. His next comedy, &quot;The Lonely Guy&quot; (1984), starred Steve Martin as a greeting card writer and was followed by &quot;Teachers&quot; (1984), a comedy-drama film starring Nick Nolte.

&quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1987) stars Shelley Long and Bette Midler. The film was successful at the box office, with Midler being nominated or winning various awards. The film was followed by &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot; (1989), another comedy again starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. Pryor plays a blind man and Wilder a deaf man who work together to thwart a trio of murderous thieves.

===1990s===
The 1990s saw Hiller directing a number of films, most of which received negative or mixed reviews: &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot; (1990); &quot;The Babe&quot; (1992), a biographical film about Babe Ruth, portrayed by John Goodman; &quot;Married to It&quot; (1993) and &quot;Carpool&quot; (1996). In 1997, Hiller helmed the infamous flop &quot;An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn&quot;, which mirrored its title when Hiller requested his name be removed from the picture – thus truly making it an Alan Smithee film. Nine years later, when he was in his 80s, Hiller directed &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Pucked&quot; (2006), his last film, which starred rock star Jon Bon Jovi.

==Influences==
In an interview with journalist Robert K. Elder for &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot;, Hiller states that the film &quot;Rome, Open City&quot; (1945) had had a strong influence on his career because he saw it right after leaving the military where he was a bomber navigator in the Canadian Air Force. The film is set during the Nazi occupation of Italy and shows the priesthood and the Communists teaming up against the enemy forces. Hiller commented, &quot;You just get the strongest emotional feelings about what happened to people in Italy.&quot;

Hiller preferred his scripts to contain &quot;good moral values,&quot; a preference which he says came from his upbringing. He wanted high quality screenplays whenever possible, which partly explains why he collaborated on multiple films with both Paddy Chayefsky and Neil Simon. Hiller explains his rationale:

==Awards and honors==

Hiller served as president of the Directors Guild of America (DGA) from 1989 to 1993 DGA presented Hiller with the Robert B. Aldrich Award in 1999 and the DGA Honorary Life Member Award in 1993. In 1970 he received a DGA Award nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film for &quot;Love Story&quot;. He was also a member of the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress from 1989 to 2005 and President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1993 to 1997. He also served on the board of the National Student Film Institute.

He received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2002 Academy Awards ceremony in recognition of his humanitarian, charitable and philanthropic efforts. In 2002, he was honoured with a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. In 2006, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Writer and producer William Froug said that &quot;Hiller is that rare and hugely successful gentleman who has remained humble all his life.&quot;

He received an honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts from the University of Victoria in June 1995. He received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Toronto in November 1995.

==Personal life and death==
In 1948, he married Gwen Pechet, who was also Jewish; they had two children and two grandchildren. His wife died on June 24, 2016. They were married for 68 years. Hiller died almost two months later in Los Angeles on August 17, 2016, at the age of 92 from natural causes. Hiller was portrayed by actor Jake Regal in the 2022 miniseries &quot;The Offer&quot;.

<text>Wang Chien-shien (; born 7 August 1938) is a Taiwanese politician who is the founder of the New Party. He was finance minister of the Republic of China from 1990 to 1992 and is the chairman of the Chinese Management Association (CMA) (since 1990). Wang was the President of the Control Yuan from August 2008 to August 2014.

==Early life and education==
Wang was born in Hefei, Anhui, in China on 7 August 1938. He grew up in Taipei and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from National Cheng Kung University in 1961 and a master&#x27;s degree from the university in 1965.

==Political career==
Wang was popular in the 1990s for his clean reputation and, in 1993, split with the Kuomintang to help found the New Party. He and Jaw Shaw-kong won the most votes in the 1992 Taiwanese legislative election. In 1998, Wang joined the election for the Mayor of Taipei under New Party. However, he lost to Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang.

In 2001, the three parties of the pan-Blue coalition, the Kuomintang, the People First Party, and the New Party agreed to field only one candidate for Taipei County magistrate in 2001 based on which party could field the most popular candidate in polls. Despite the unified ticket and a poll predicting him winning, Wang lost to Su Tseng-chang. Wang is married to Su Fa-jau ().

In July 2008 Wang was nominated by President Ma and approved by the Legislative Yuan to become the President of the Control Yuan. Wang left office on July 31, 2014.

On March 8, 2023, Wang announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election as an independent, pledging cross-strait reunification by 2025.

<text>Michael David Spivak (May 25, 1940October 1, 2020) was an American mathematician specializing in differential geometry, an expositor of mathematics, and the founder of Publish-or-Perish Press. Spivak was the author of the five-volume &quot;A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry&quot;, which won the Leroy P. Steele Prize for expository writing in 1985.

== Biography ==
Spivak was born in Queens, New York. He received his Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) from Harvard University in 1960, and in 1964 he received his Ph.D. from Princeton University under the supervision of John Milnor, with his thesis, &quot;On Spaces Satisfying Poincaré Duality&quot;. Afterwards, Spivak taught as a full-time Math Lecturer at Brandeis University, whilst writing &quot;Calculus on Manifolds: A Modern Approach to Classical Theorems of Advanced Calculus&quot;, which was later translated into Polish, Spanish, Japanese and Russian. In 1967, he won a year-long National Science Foundation fellowship to Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, after which Spivak returned to Brandeis as Assistant Professor of Mathematics until 1970. In his last year as Assistant Professor, he published the first two volumes of &quot;what would become a five-volume masterpiece with the daunting title, &quot;Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry&quot;.&quot; In 1985, Spivak received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for this five-volume set.

In 2004, Spivak lectured on elementary physics. Spivak&#x27;s book, &quot;Physics for Mathematicians: Mechanics I&quot; (published December 6, 2010), contains the material that these lectures stemmed from and more. Spivak was also the designer of the MathTime Professional 2 fonts (which are widely used in academic publishing) and the creator of the TV series &quot;Science International&quot;.

Spivak was gay. He met his partner, Michael Kramer, in 1997.

Spivak died on October 1, 2020.

== Writing ==
His five-volume &quot;A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry&quot; is among his most influential and celebrated works. The distinctive pedagogical aim of the work, as stated in its preface, was to elucidate for graduate students the often obscure relationship between classical differential geometry—geometrically intuitive but imprecise—and its modern counterpart, replete with precise but unintuitive algebraic definitions. On several occasions, most prominently in &quot;Volume 2&quot;, Spivak &quot;translates&quot; the classical language that Gauss or Riemann would be familiar with to the abstract language that a modern differential geometer might use. The Leroy P. Steele Prize was awarded to Spivak in 1985 for his authorship of the work.

Spivak also authored several well-known undergraduate textbooks. Among them, his textbook &quot;Calculus&quot; takes a rigorous and theoretical approach to introductory calculus and includes proofs of many theorems taken on faith in most other introductory textbooks. Spivak acknowledged in the preface of the second edition that the work is arguably an introduction to mathematical analysis rather than a calculus textbook. Another of his well-known textbooks is &quot;Calculus on Manifolds,&quot; a concise (146 pages) but rigorous and modern treatment of multivariable calculus accessible to advanced undergraduates.

Spivak also wrote &quot;The Joy of TeX: A Gourmet Guide to Typesetting with the AMS-TeX Macro Package&quot; and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to Calculus&quot;. The book &quot;Morse Theory&quot; by Spivak&#x27;s PhD advisor John Milnor was based on lecture notes by Spivak and Robert Wells (as mentioned on the cover page of the booklet).

=== Spivak pronouns ===

Spivak used a set of English gender-neutral pronouns, &quot;e/em/eir&quot;, in his book &quot;The Joy of TeX&quot;, which are often referred to as Spivak pronouns. Spivak stated that he did not originate these pronouns.
