<doc id="322788" wikidata="Q1853312" url="?curid=322788" title="List of universities and colleges in France">
<text>This list of universities and colleges in France includes universities and other higher education institutes that provide both education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research activities. They are the backbone of the tertiary education institutions in France.
They are listed as different categories, depending on their administrative status, size and extents of research activity compared to educational activities.

Aside from the nationally funded public education system that provides recognised degrees to the vast majority of students in France and that keeps tuition fees low, there exist private institutes.

==Public universities in France==
French public universities (see List of public universities in France for a detailed list) are as of 2015 in the process of reorganization according to the Law on Higher Education and Research passed in July 2013. This includes some merging of institutions, and the previous high-level organization under (PRES) has been dissolved for Communities of Universities and Institutions (COMUE).

==Public technical universities, institutes of technologies and autonomous scientific higher education institutes==
The (EPCSP) that are not listed as universities in the list above operate as university-grade institutes.

<doc id="322789" wikidata="Q330041" url="?curid=322789" title="List of universities in Germany">
<text>This is a list of the universities in Germany, of which there are about seventy. The list also includes German &quot;Technische Universitäten&quot; (universities of technology), which have official and full university status, but usually focus on engineering and the natural sciences rather than covering the whole spectrum of academic disciplines. Some twenty German universities rank among top 200 universities in world. Highest ranked universities in Germany include some research oriented universities for MS, MBA, medical and engineering.

The list does not, however, cover the German &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot; (University of Applied Sciences) or institutions that cover only certain disciplines such as business studies, fine arts, or engineering. Those do not have all of the responsibilities and limitations of universities, and most cannot award doctorate degrees on their own.

A private university is included in the list if it awards its own doctorate degree. 

In general, public German universities do not charge tuition fees. At many universities this usually also applies to foreign students, though regulations for non-EU foreign citizens differ regionally. Universities may charge small fees for administrative costs.
== Universities by date of establishment ==
This is a list of the ten oldest universities that have been in continuous operation since their founding in present-day Germany. The oldest university in the modern German-speaking world is the University of Vienna founded in 1365.

Some universities were established in the 14th or 15th centuries, but shut down for longer periods and later re-opened (e.g. the universities of Cologne, Erfurt, Ingolstadt, Mainz and Würzburg). These are not included in this list.

<text>Under Hong Kong law, there are 22 accredited degree-awarding higher education institutions in Hong Kong. The following is a list.

Only the first three categories of higher education are eligible to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees or above in Hong Kong.

==Universities==

The following notation is used:
*UGC-funded universities: universities funded by public and under the University Grants Committee

<doc id="322795" wikidata="Q12480657" url="?curid=322795" title="List of Israeli universities and colleges">
<text>As of August 2021, there are ten universities and 53 colleges in Israel, which are recognized and academically supervised by the Council for Higher Education in Israel. In addition, Israel founded a university in Ariel in the West Bank, which used to be academically supervised by the Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria. As many course offerings are varied, Israeli universities are considered to be of top quality, and they are inexpensive to attend. Israel&#x27;s quality university education is largely responsible for spurring the country&#x27;s high tech boom and rapid economic development.

The primary difference between a &quot;university&quot; and a &quot;college&quot; in Israel is that only a university can confer doctorate degrees, and therefore tends to be more research-oriented than the more teaching-oriented colleges.

==Universities==
Israel&#x27;s universities are listed below, followed by their English acronym, establishment date, location, latest data about the number of students and the institute&#x27;s academic rank of the top world universities, according to WebOMetrics (top 3000), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) (top 500) and The Times Higher Education Supplement (THES) (top 200), &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; also known as the Shanghai Ranking (&quot;ARWU)&quot;:

Most universities offer the full range of graduate and undergraduate degrees: Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, Master&#x27;s degrees, and doctorates. However, the Weizmann Institute does not grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

==Colleges==

Other institutes of higher education that are accredited by CHEI to confer a bachelor&#x27;s (and in some cases a master&#x27;s) degree are known as &quot;colleges&quot; ( &quot;Mikhlala&quot;; pl. &quot;Mikhlalot&quot;). There are also over twenty teacher training colleges - most of which will award only the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.).

1Located in the Israeli occupied territories

===Non-degree post-secondary education schools===
The Ministry of Education has also certified certain institutions to award Professional Certificates instead of academic degrees. These include certificates in technology and in the performing arts.
*Beersheba Tehni School combines secondary military preparation with post-secondary practical engineer certification to qualify engineers for service in the Israel Air Force
*Beit Zvi School of the Performing Arts, Ramat Gan
*Sam Spiegel Film and Television School, Jerusalem

===Non-Israeli certified Colleges===
Several colleges – primarily religious institutions – operate in Israel that are &quot;not&quot; certified by the CHEI, but rather are accredited by international bodies outside of Israel.

*Bethlehem Bible College includes a campus within Israel at Nazareth, as well as two campuses in the Palestinian Authority at Bethlehem and Gaza, accredited by Asia Theological Association and Middle East Association of Theological Education
*Israel College of the Bible, Netanya
*Jerusalem University College
*Nazareth Evangelical College
*Reidman College, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Beersheba, Eilat, Kinneret, and Misgav, offers alternative medicine certificates not recognized by the Ministry of Education, and offers a BA degree in Chinese Medicine through Zhejiang Chinese Medical University
==Foreign university campuses==
The following foreign colleges and universities maintain international branch campuses in Israel:

*Brigham Young University – the BYU Jerusalem Center
*Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion
*Hillsong College, in conjunction with Hillsong Church Israel
*NYU, which enrolls the largest number of Jewish students of any public or private university in the United States, and is ranked in the top 34 globally in all major publications of university rankings, has a campus in Tel Aviv.
*Touro University offers courses in Jerusalem, but a degree must be completed in New York
*University of Indianapolis
*Yeshiva University

==Research universities==
Research universities in the Netherlands are institutions of tertiary education that in Dutch are called &quot;universiteit&quot;. Their focus is towards academic education and scientific research. They are accredited to confer bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and (with the exception of the Netherlands Defence Academy) doctoral degrees. Prior to the Bologna Process, the universities granted &quot;drs.&quot; (&quot;doctorandus&quot;), &quot;mr. (for law studies)&quot; and &quot;ir.&quot; (for engineering studies) degrees, which are equivalent to current MA, LLM or MSc degrees. The term &quot;universiteit&quot; is reserved to doctorate granting institutes in the Dutch context, and the additional qualifier &quot;research&quot; is hardly ever used in practice.

There are Semi-Public Universities and Private Universities in Netherlands. The semi-public status of most Dutch universities arises from the fact that they have both public and private characteristics. In this respect, their public funding is entirely output-based, determined by the number of undergraduate and graduate degrees delivered. Except for this output-based funding, Dutch universities are largely private entities that, since 1998, own and operate their real estate at their own risk; moreover, all employees of Dutch universities have labor contracts based on private sector terms (as of 2020). 


==Universities of Applied Sciences==
Universities of applied sciences (Dutch: &quot;hogeschool&quot;) in the Netherlands are focused on professional education rather than scientific research. While the literal translation of hogeschool is &quot;high school&quot;, these are second-tier institutes of higher education, and can be compared with colleges or polytechnics or similar in other countries.
They are accredited to confer bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. Prior to the Bologna Process, they also conferred professional engineer&#x27;s (abbreviated ing.) degrees. Dutch universities of applied sciences are not accredited to confer doctoral (PhD) degrees; PhD studies can sometimes be conducted in the context of a university of applied sciences, however, the title will be granted by one of the research universities, and a full professor of that university will be appointed as principal supervisor (promotor).
In international contexts, the phrase &quot;University of Applied Sciences&quot; is used for the majority of these schools, as suggested by the Dutch Minister of Education. Some specific exceptions have been made. For example, tertiary art schools and schools of education use an internationally recognisable name of choice.
The Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences include the following:
*Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten (Amsterdam University of the Arts), Amsterdam

<text>This is a list of the universities in New Zealand, of which there are eight. As of 2024, all universities are public. All of the universities, with the exception of AUT, are descended from the former University of New Zealand, a collegiate university that existed from 1870 to 1961. In 2021, universities provided tertiary education to over 182,900 students or 142,720 equivalent full-time students (EFTS).

<doc id="322800" wikidata="Q1708511" url="?curid=322800" title="List of universities in Norway">
<text>This list of universities in Norway presents the country&#x27;s universities, giving their locations, ownership, and years of establishment.

Denmark-Norway only had one university, the University of Copenhagen. In 1811, the Royal Frederick&#x27;s University (now the University of Oslo) was established, based on the traditions and curriculum of the University of Copenhagen and effectively as a Norwegian successor institution. It remains the country&#x27;s highest ranked university, and was Norway&#x27;s only university until 1946. In the postwar era the University of Bergen, the University of Trondheim (now NTNU), and the University of Tromsø (now UiT The Arctic University of Norway) were founded. These universities are known as the &quot;old universities&quot;.

Norway also has a number of university colleges, that are traditionally focused on vocational programs such as nursing or teacher education. Several of these colleges have received university status in recent years, and are referred to as &quot;new universities,&quot; in contrast to the &quot;old universities.&quot;

Most of the university colleges were created in 1994, following the university college reform. The Arctic University of Norway is the world&#x27;s northernmost. Schools with an asterisk (*) have been created as the result of a merger.

== Universities ==
Universities have the right to establish study programmes at all levels and all subjects.
== Specialized universities ==
In the Norwegian education system, a specialized university is an educational institution at university level within narrower subject areas, with the same type of responsibilities and powers for education, research and research training. Specialized Universities can accredit study programmes at bachelor’s degree level in all subject areas. They can also accredit study programmes at all levels in subjects in which they have been granted the right to award doctoral degrees. 
== University colleges / Universities of applied sciences ==
University colleges / Universities of applied sciences can accredit study programmes at bachelor’s degree level in all subject areas. They can also accredit study programmes at all levels in subjects in which they have been granted the right to award doctoral degrees.
== University colleges with accredited study programs ==
The following list includes colleges with accredited study programmes, i.e. institutions which are not designated as higher education institutions as such, but which have been accredited for one (or more) studies at higher education level. An institution can, for example, have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a specific study accredited by NOKUT without the institution itself being accredited at that level. Institutions with accredited study programs can use the designation &quot;university college&quot;, even if they do not have institutional college accreditation. They also fall under the Universities and Colleges Act, and can use the protected title of professor.

<doc id="322802" wikidata="Q994720" url="?curid=322802" title="List of universities in Poland">
<text>This is a list of universities in Poland. In total, there are approximately 457 universities and collegiate-level institutions of higher education in Poland, including 131 government-funded and 326 privately owned universities, with almost 2 million enrolled students . According to the March 18, 2011 Act of the Polish Parliament, the universities are divided into categories based on their legal status and level of authorization.

There are forty publicly funded and two private universities considered classical, granting doctoral degrees on top of bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in at least ten fields of knowledge. The remaining universities are divided according to their educational profile usually reflected in their differing names. &quot;Academy&quot; is used for institutions which focus on fine arts, music and drama. The &quot;technical universities&quot; specialize in engineering and the physical sciences. (The name refers to the subjects taught; they are not technical schools.)

In total, there are 24 cities in Poland, with between one and eight state-funded universities each. Among the top are Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Łódź and Wrocław. The Polish names of listed universities are given in brackets, followed by a standard abbreviation (if commonly used or if existent). Note that some of the institutions might choose to translate their own name as &quot;university&quot; in English, even if they do not officially have the Polish-language equivalent name of &quot;uniwersytet&quot;.

<text>This is a list of universities in Singapore.

The oldest university in Singapore is the National University of Singapore, which was established in its current form in 1980, but has a history in tertiary education dating back to 1905. The university along with the Nanyang Technological University are research intensive and rank the highest in global university ranking publications. Newer universities have been established by the Singaporean Government since 2000 that specialise in various sectors and in applied learning. Singapore also has partnered and directly-operated campuses from foreign universities and other private institutions offering external degree programs from overseas institutions.

The university rankings included below are for reference only. Different university ranking publications use varying methodologies to rank universities and cannot accurately calculate teaching performance, research quality and other abstract functions into a singular numerical composite. University ranking methodologies have been criticised for their subjectivity, bias and lack of consideration for institutional specialisations. Institutional competitiveness reinforced by ranking publication results also discourages inter-institutional academic co-operation, non-anglophone thought and have been described a modern form of colonialism. The pursuit for higher rankings has also caused many universities globally to prioritise staff for research output over teaching skills and cause stress to high school students.

<text>This is a list of universities in [[South Africa]]. In this list, colleges and universities are defined as accredited, degree-granting, tertiary institutions. As of September 2022, only South African public degree-granting institutions may call themselves a &quot;university&quot;, whereas other accredited private for-profit or not-for-profit degree-granting institutions tend to call themselves colleges, institutes or business schools.

Some of these private institutions are local campuses of foreign universities. Degree-granting institutions (both public and private) must be registered with, and have their specific degree programs accredited by, the Council on Higher Education.

In 2004 South Africa started reforming its public higher education system, merging and incorporating small public universities into larger institutions, and renaming all higher education institutions &quot;university&quot; (previously there had been several types of higher education institution). The country&#x27;s universities and &quot;technikons&quot;, which were incorporated with others and thus no longer exist, are listed at the end of the article.

Two new universities launched in 2013, Sol Plaatje University and the University of Mpumalanga. They are tentatively classified in the universities of technology category, pending clarification of their programs.

==Public universities==
Public universities in South Africa are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees; universities of technology (&quot;technikons&quot;), which offer vocational oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer a combination of both types of qualification.

===Traditional universities===


Note1: By merger of existing institutions

Note2: Exact and current numbers not available, these numbers are from the University of Pretoria&#x27;s wiki.

Note3: The university&#x27;s business school the Gordon Institute of Business Science has a campus in Illovo and an inner-city campus on Pritchard Street, in downtown Johannesburg.

Note4: Split out from the University of Limpopo into which Medical University of South Africa had previously merged.

===Comprehensive universities===

<doc id="322815" wikidata="Q338956" url="?curid=322815" title="Phoberomys pattersoni">
<text>Phoberomys pattersoni is an extinct rodent that lived in the ancient Orinoco River delta around 8 million years ago. It was the second-largest of the roughly seven species of its genus. Like many other rodents, &quot;Phoberomys&quot; was a herbivore with high-crowned premolars and molars. 

== Description ==
An almost complete skeleton was discovered in the Urumaco Formation at Urumaco, Venezuela, in 2000. The new species was later classified with the name &quot;Phoberomys pattersoni&quot; in honor of palaeontologist Brian Patterson. 

Originally, &quot;Phoberomys pattersoni&quot; was estimated as being approximately 741 kg based on dimensions of the femur, which at the time made it the largest known species of rodent, living or extinct. However, these estimates were criticized as being too large by later studies, which found that &quot;Phoberomys&quot; had an exceptionally thick femur relative to its body compared to other mammals. Body mass estimates based on skull length, occipital condyle width, tooth row length, and femur length suggest &quot;Phoberomys&quot; weighed between , making it about the same size as a large antelopes such as greater kudu and waterbuck. Although &quot;Phoberomys pattersoni&quot; was considered the largest known rodent at the time of its description, the discovery of a complete skull of &quot;Josephoartigasia monesi&quot; in 2008 showed this species to be even larger. &quot;Josephoartigasia&quot; was known at the time of &quot;P. pattersoni&quot;&#x27;s discovery (specifically, the species &quot;Artigasia magna&quot;, now &quot;Josephoartigasia magna&quot;), but the size of this rodent could not easily be determined because it was only known from jaw fragments and the teeth of &quot;Josephoartigasia&quot; are unusually small relative to its body size.

<text>The Italian overture is a piece of orchestral music which opened several operas, oratorios and other large-scale works in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

An Italian overture typically has a three-movement structure – the outer movements are quick, the middle movement is slow.

This type of overture was particularly popular among Italian composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti, and in the early 18th century would usually be called &quot;sinfonia&quot;. Later, to avoid confusion with other types of sinfonia/symphony, the term &quot;Italian overture&quot; was used more frequently.

The structure of the Italian overture/sinfonia was the base from which the classical multi-movement cycle - used in genres including the symphony, concerto, and sonata - developed around the middle of the 18th century. For more about the (18th century) relationship between &quot;Italian&quot; overtures, other types of overtures (e.g. the &quot;French overture&quot;) and early symphonies, see sinfonia.

<text>Marcel Dassault (; born Marcel Ferdinand Bloch; 23 January 1892 – 17 April 1986) was a French engineer and industrialist who spent his career in aircraft manufacturing. He was also involved in politics, serving intermittently more than three decades in both houses of the French Parliament from 1951 until his death in 1986.

==Early life and education==
Born on 23 January 1892 in Paris, as the youngest of the four children of Adolphe Bloch, a doctor, and his wife Noémie Allatini. His parents were Jewish.

He was educated at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris. After studies in electrical engineering, he graduated from the Breguet School and Supaéro. At the latter school, Bloch was classmates with a Russian student named Mikhail Gurevich, who would later become instrumental in the creation of the MiG aircraft series.

==Career==

Bloch worked at the French Aeronautics Research Laboratory at Chalais-Meudon during World War I and invented a type of aircraft propeller subsequently used by the French army during the conflict. In 1916, with Henry Potez and Louis Coroller, he formed a company, the &quot;Société d&#x27;Études Aéronautiques&quot;, to produce the SEA series of fighters.

In 1928, Bloch founded the aircraft company &quot;Société des Avions Marcel Bloch&quot;, which produced its first aircraft in 1930. In 1935, Bloch and Henry Potez entered into an agreement to buy &quot;Société Aérienne Bordelaise&quot; (SAB). In 1936, the company was nationalized as the &quot;Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Sud Ouest&quot; (SNCASO). Bloch agreed to become the delegated administrator of the Minister for Air.

During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany during World War II, France&#x27;s aviation industry was virtually disbanded, other than the compulsory manufacturing, assembly, and servicing of German designs. In October 1940, Bloch refused to collaborate with the German occupiers at Bordeaux-Aéronautique and was imprisoned by the Vichy government.

In 1944, the Nazis deported Bloch to the Buchenwald concentration camp, as punishment for refusing to co-operate with their regime. He was tortured, beaten, and held in solitary confinement. In the meantime, his wife was interned near Paris. Bloch was detained at Buchenwald until it was liberated on 11 April 1945. By the time of his return to Paris, he was disabled to such an extent that he could barely walk. He was advised by his doctors to settle his affairs, as they did not expect him to recover his health.

After the war, he changed his name from Bloch to Bloch-Dassault and in 1949 to Dassault. This name derived from &#x27;Chardasso&#x27;, the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; used by his brother, General Darius Paul Bloch, when he served in the French Resistance. The pseudonym was a play on &quot;char d&#x27;assaut&quot;, French for &quot;assault tank&quot;. In 1971, Dassault acquired Breguet, forming &quot;Avions Marcel Dassault–Breguet Aviation&quot; (AMD–BA).

== Personal life ==

In 1919, Bloch married Madeleine Minckès, the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family of furniture dealers. They had two sons, Claude and Serge. After changing his name to Dassault, he converted to the Roman Catholic Church in 1950.

In July 1952, Dassault acquired the Paris landmark buildings now known as Hôtel Marcel Dassault, dating from 1844,
at nos. 7 and 9 rond-point des Champs-Élysées (at the corner of the avenue des Champs-Élysées and avenue Montaigne), from the Sabatier d&#x27;Espeyran family. The building at no. 7 has been used since 2002 by the auction house Artcurial, which had further alterations made under the direction of architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte. While no. 7 has been sold, no. 9 is still used by the &quot;Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault&quot;.

In 1973, Dassault was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

==Death and legacy==

Dassault died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1986 and was buried at the Passy Cemetery in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.

Serge Dassault, Marcel&#x27;s younger son, became CEO of &quot;Avions Marcel Dassault&quot;, which was restructured as &quot;Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault&quot;, reflecting its broader interests. In 1990, the aviation division was renamed Dassault Aviation.

In 1991, the &quot;rond-point des Champs-Elysées&quot; in Paris was renamed the &quot;rond-point des Champs-Elysées-Marcel-Dassault&quot; in his honour.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; book &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, Dassault is parodied as the aircraft construction tycoon Laszlo Carreidas – &quot;the millionaire who never laughs&quot; – who offers Tintin, Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus his personal jet, the Carreidas 160, to travel to Sydney.

<text>Frederick William, Prince von Hessenstein (17 March 1735, Stockholm — 27 July 1808, Panker), was a Swedish statesman and a soldier of German ancestry. 

== Biography ==
He was the eldest extramarital son of King Frederick I of Sweden, member of the House of Hesse, and his royal mistress Hedvig Ulrika Taube.
King Gustav III treated him with great respect. He was appointed Field Marshal in 1773, Privy Councillor in 1776, and Governor-General of Pomerania between 1776 and 1791. Hessenstein was made a count of the Holy Roman Empire (in which his father&#x27;s German realm, the landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, was located) on 28 February 1741, and created a Swedish count on 29 March of the following year. He was elevated to Prince von Hessenstein in the Empire in November 1772, and hereditary Prince von Hessenstein also in Sweden on 28 April 1785. In 1773, he was also made one of the Lords of the Realm.

According to unverified rumors, he might have been the father of an extramarital daughter by Princess Sofia Albertina, Gustav III&#x27;s sister. Named Sophia, she was allegedly born in 1786, a year before the princess was sent to Germany as Abbess of Quedlinburg.

<doc id="322826" wikidata="Q2663137" url="?curid=322826" title="Hedvig Taube">
<text>Hedvig Ulrika Taube (31 October 1714 – 11 February 1744), also Countess von Hessenstein, was a Swedish courtier and countess, a countess of the Holy Roman Empire, and royal mistress to king Frederick I of Sweden from 1731 to 1744. She and Sophie Hagman are the only two official royal mistresses in Swedish history.

== Early life ==
Hedvig Taube was one of 9 children of Count Edvard Didrik Taube (1681-1751) and Christina Maria Falkenberg (1686-1753). Her sister, Catherine Charlotte, was to marry the brother of scientist Countess Eva Ekeblad, who was also the aunt of the renowned Axel von Fersen the Younger.
In 1716, the future king Frederick became one of the godparents to her sister Christina Beata. During the 1720s, her father was nearly ruined and placed in heavy debt because of gambling and bad business: in 1730, the family had been forced to change their city residence to a cheaper one.

Hedvig Taube was described as a beauty, and in 1730, the king noticed her, likely on a visit to baron Otto Reinhold Strömfelt, who was married to her paternal aunt. He started to court her with baskets of fruit and flowers sent to the home of her indebted father: reportedly, jewels and other valuable items were hidden beneath the fruit. He also inquired whether Arvid Horn would be willing to house her, so as to make it possible for the king to court her in person. Horn refused, and during the Riksdag of 1731, he warned the king that he was the topic of dislike in the Clergy estate for courting a young unmarried lady.

The king&#x27;s favorite and confidant, Erland Broman, convinced her father to agree to a sexual relationship between his daughter and the king. Hedvig Taube herself, however, was engaged to a young count Erik Sparre and refused, supported by her mother. Her mother suggested to take Hedvig Taube with her to their country estate Kungshatt to avoid the king&#x27;s attention, but her spouse: &quot;sold his daughter to the king for quite a sizable sum. His debts were paid and promotions made for his sons and his relations&quot;, and he sent his wife alone to the country and kept his daughter with him in the capital. Her betrothed, Erik Sparre, was also removed, as he was included to be a part of the entourage accompanied the king to his visit to Hesse, and several people were sent to Hedvig Taube to convince her to agree to the king&#x27;s advances upon his return, notably her father&#x27;s maiden aunt Beata Taube and Carl Tersmeden, calling her future fate more beautiful than she could imagine. She was convinced by being pressed by her duty to her family, and the custom of &quot;Maîtresse-en-titre&quot; in France, which was not seen as improper there and would be introduced in Sweden with her. Meanwhile, her mother was convinced to agree to the matter by Eleonora Lindhielm and Hedvig Catharina Lillie, married to Daniel Niklas von Höpken and Magnus Julius De la Gardie, who wished to benefit their political careers by supporting the king.

In the company of her mother and aunt, Hedvig Taube was brought to the king at Karlberg Palace upon his return from Hesse 12 November 1731. Shortly thereafter, she was appointed &quot;hovfröken&quot; (maid of honour), to queen Ulrika Eleonora to become accessible to the king at court and, though it was not spoken aloud, to become his mistress. When the carriage came to take her to court, Tersmeden reported her saying; &quot;My fate is harder than I could imagine. I am being forced to expose my virtue to save a family ruined by gambling&quot;.
Her father was appointed &quot;riksråd&quot;, and others who had participated in the affair in the king&#x27;s favor were rewarded.

==Maid of honor==
During her tenure as maid of honor at court, her position as mistress to the king was kept secret. Initially, the relationship was kept a secret from the queen by her favorite and confidant Emerentia von Düben. The queen did not consider it proper to expose the monarch to slander in public, and participated in protecting the king&#x27;s reputation. During the hunting trip to Dalarna, which the royal court undertook in 1732 to celebrate the visit of the king&#x27;s brother Prince William of Hesse, the queen demonstrated her disregard to the rumors by displaying affection to her maid of honor Hedvig Taube, when they were seen by the public during walks.

At this point, she was regarded at court as a temporary amusement. She was referred to as &quot;la belle Colombe&quot; by the king, who gave her gifts financed by his income from Hesse. In the winter of 1733–34, Taube was pregnant with her first child. The affair was kept a secret: Taube retired to her room simulating bedridden illness as soon as the pregnancy could not be hidden, and before the birth was due, in February 1734 the king convinced the queen to take the royal court to Ulriksdal Palace, and Taube was left alone to give birth in the royal palace in Stockholm. The child, a daughter known as &quot;Mamsell Erlich&quot;, was left to a foster mother, but died soon after. Hedvig Taube avoided official discovery, but the birth was subject of widespread gossip in the capital.

Hedvig Taube was supported by her family, as well as the politicians Daniel Niklas von Höpken, Karl Gyllenborg and Hans Reinhold von Fersen and their followers, and on their request, she made recommendations of candidates to political offices to the king, something which created rising discontent.
She did, however, not display any personal interest in state affairs. The French envoy in Sweden, Charles Louis de Biaudos de Casteja, was known to recognize the participation of women in the Swedish party strife of the Age of Liberty and confirmed to have recruited several female agents for French interests in Sweden, such as Charlotta von Liewen and Margareta Gyllenstierna, attempted to recruit the king&#x27;s mistress Hedvig Taube for 100.000 &quot;livres&quot;, but she refused and expressed no interest to be involved in state affairs.

== Royal mistress ==

In late 1734, Hedvig Taube conceived again, and this time, she left her position at court and was installed at a private residence the king had arranged for her close to the royal residence of Wrangel Palace awaiting her delivery, where he regularly visited her by litter. On 17 March 1735, she gave birth to a son by the king in her residence, which were given the king&#x27;s brother William of Hesse as his godfather and promised the title count of Hesse, while Hedvig Taube were given an allowance of 12.000 dlr from the state of Hesse, where the king was ruling Landgrave. All this made the relationship between the king and Hedvig Taube exposed in public and unable to conceal and herself the first acknowledged royal mistress in Sweden, which resulted in a public scandal. After her public acknowledgement and first appearance at court in 1735, the queen protested by claiming to be indisposed and refused to leave her rooms. After this snub, Taube never appeared at court again.

Public opinion favored the queen, who enjoyed great popularity for her personal piety and for being the only remaining member of the old Swedish dynasty. The queen herself, however, refused to display public displeasure, as this opposed her view on royal dignity. She did confess her displeasure in private to her confidante Emerentia von Düben, who, however, stated that it would be undignified for Ulrika Eleonora to notice this affair, and that her position as queen was untouchable: &quot;As the moon continue its course over the sky with no care for the barks of dogs, so should Her Majesty despise the gossip, which has been unleashed by this so unfortunate and blind commitment.&quot;

After the birth, the king referred to Hedvig Taube more respectfully as &quot;la Comtesse Taube&quot; rather than &quot;la belle Colombe&quot;. The scandal initially ostracized Hedvig Taube from society, but her isolation was broken when a group of female members of the nobility, Sarah Derith (spouse of Carl Gyllenborg), Eleonora Magdalena Wachtmeister and Eleonora Lindheim (spouse of Daniel Niklas von Höpken) paid her an official visit to ask the monarch through Taube to benefit the career of their spouses, which discontinued the ostracism and initiated her career as intermediary to the king. After this Hedvig Taube hosted her own receptions in her residence, sometimes alone, and sometimes in the company of the king, and were courted by artists and supplicants. She acted as the patron of artists, the most noted one being Olof von Dahlin, who has been referred to as her court poet. According to contemporaries, Hedvig Taube had &quot;power over the king&#x27;s mind&quot;, and &quot;the use she made of it eventually came to have rather significant consequences in both interior- and foreign policy&quot;. However, her influence was normally used not to promote an agenda of any kind, but to make recommendations of candidates to various positions to the king, something which was successfully used by her father. Her salon became a center for the Hats (party), who opposed the Caps (party) government under Arvid Horn and sought to influence the king through her after the Riksdag of 1734 until the Riksdag of 1738. She herself, however, was reportedly not in opposition to Horn.

===Riksdag of 1738–39===

The Riksdag of 1738–39 signified a crisis for Hedvig Taube. Frustrated at her refusal to be recruited as an agent and influence the monarch in favor of the French-supported Hats, the Hats party under Carl Gyllenborg withdrew their support to her appending the Riksdag of 1738. Already in the inauguration of the Swedish language theater at &quot;Bollhuset&quot; the previous year, Gylleborg&#x27;s play &quot;Svenska sprätthöken&quot; had criticized the king and government, and prior to the Riksdag of 1738, the leading Hat party sympathizer, the salon hostess Hedvig Catharina Lillie arranged a play in her private theater in honor to the birth day of the king, were the relationship of the king and Taube were caricatured, an incident that affected opinion in favor of the Hats party in the following election, as they had positioned themselves against the adultery of the monarch. Numerous pamphlets and propaganda circulated condemning the adultery of the king and the Caps government in the name of the Hat party, and Carl Gyllenborg himself wrote an anonymous letter of complaint to the archbishop Jöns Steuchius accusing him of neglecting his duty, signed &quot;Lisa Husbonde&quot; (Lisa the Master of the House). All this stirred public opinion, and Hedvig Taube reportedly used bribes in an attempt to prevent the matter from being raised in parliament.

During the Riksdag of 1738–39, the father of Hedvig Taube was deposed as riksråd after Sten Coyet had raised the question of the relationship between his daughter and the king. The question of the king&#x27;s adultery with Hedvig Taube was finally raised in the Riksdag by Fryxell, a member of the clergy estate. The archbishop had already had a private conversation with the queen about he matter, during which the queen had lamented herself over the king&#x27;s adultery and her disappointment of the Taube family.
The clergy estate pointed to the oath made by the king in 1720, when he succeeded the queen on the Swedish throne after she abdicated in his favor, in which he had made the promise to: &quot;love, honor and respect my most worthy consort, the all powerful Princess Ulrica Eleonora [...] and declare the Estates to be free of their oath of allegiance, should I ever break this oath and insurance&quot;, in fact declaring the king deposed if he disrespected the queen.
A delegation was made of bishop Erik Benzelius the Younger and superintendent Aurvillius. On 2 April 1739, the delegation interrogated the confessor of the royal court, Stiernman, who denied having performed any secret marriage ceremony between the king and Taube, denied being aware of any illegitimate children of hers and refused to reveal anything said under confession. On 3 April, the delegation visited the king. Frederick I stated that he could not undo what was done; that he was not the only man with illegitimate children; that Bishop Benzelius was not the right person to throw the first stone, referring to the scandals surrounding the bishop&#x27;s daughter Greta Benzelia; that he would defend Taube against anyone and that his sin with Taube was a matter between himself and God and that his oath as king did not concern his private life.
On 26 April, the king expressed a wish to leave for Hesse. He was rumored to plan to settle there permanently with Taube. A rumor circulated of a planned coup d&#x27;état by the queen&#x27;s followers. The plan was to have the king leave with Taube, leaving the queen as regent of Sweden in his absence. After his departure, the queen&#x27;s followers would present her with proof that the king had secretly married Taube, expecting the queen to respond by considering her marriage dissolved and agree to be reinstated as monarch. This planned coup never took place; the king never presented a request to leave for Hesse. In parallel, however, great estates was bought in Holstein through Erland Broman and with Hessian money: Panker, Todendorf, Clamp, Hohenfelde, Vogelsdorf and Schmoll, for the sons of Hedvig Taube.

The Riksdag of 1738–39 ended with a new government of the Hats party. The Hat government was allied with France against Russia. They reportedly also used the matter of Hedvig Taube as a tool to control the king. When the king&#x27;s brother William of Hesse married a British princess, the king accepted British money to Hesse, in his capacity as Landgrave of Hesse. This resulted in a crisis between the king and the Hats government, who saw the alliance between Sweden ad France undermined and discredited by the alliance between Great Britain and Hesse, as Hesse and Sweden was at the time united by a personal union. This crisis was used by the British-supported Caps party, who believed that they would be given the king&#x27;s support, if only Taube, the Hats pressure tool, was removed. The king&#x27;s brother William of Hesse, regent of Hesse in his absence and heir to the throne of Hesse, were also in strong opposition to Taube, due to her allowance was taken from the Hessian state and because of his fear that the king would marry her in the future and make her sons heirs to the Hessian throne, and through his envoy in Sweden, he pressured his brother to get rid of Taube. In the summer of 1740, the sons of Taube were sent to their estates in Holstein, and some time after, she left to join them, after having been threatened by the Hessian president Danckelmann with loss of her Hessian allowance, despite the Hat party&#x27;s attempts to make her stay. However, she stopped halfway and stayed at the estate Östermalma near Nyköping with her brother-in-law count Wolter Reinhold Stackelberg.

===Riksdag of 1740–41===

During the following Riksdag of 1740–41, an opportunity aroused for the Hat government to declare war against Russia, in which they sought the king&#x27;s support. Despite the queen&#x27;s opposition to the war, the king gave his consent, thereafter being given support from the Hats party to resume his relationship with Taube. He then left for Nyköping, officially on a hunting trip, where he resumed his relationship with Hedvig Taube and presented her with a document from the Holy Roman Emperor (during the interregnum represented by the Elector of Saxony), granting her sons the titles Imperial counts of Hessenstein.
Hedvig Taube returned to the capital, though to avoid provocations, she initially stayed in a rented cottage in the Söder area outside the city.

The Riksdag of 1740–41 resulted in a new crisis for Hedvig Taube. At this point, a change had occurred in the queen&#x27;s attitude, signs which was observed already during the Riksdag of 1738. Despite demonstrating her compassion with the other riksråd deposed during the riksdag, she smiled when the misfortune of the father of Hedvig Taube was mentioned. When hosting the wedding of her maid of honor Sigrid Bonde at court, she neglected to invite the Taube, Gylleborg and Sparre families (the last two known to support Hedvig Taube), despite court protocol which would have expected them to be included, and when the new riksråd Carl Sparre, a known support of Taube, was presented to her during the audience for the new members of government, she demonstratively retired, preventing him from kissing her skirt in accordance with protocol.
The Queen was jealous and felt her pride was hurt. Another reason to her change of conduct was reportedly that she, as an orthodox Lutheran, was concerned for the king&#x27;s soul because of his adultery. The return of Hedvig Taube after her temporary exile was apparently the last straw, and she reacted to it by retiring to bed and refused to show herself in public for some time.

The discontent of queen Ulrika Eleonora was not a small matter for the Riksdag: not only due to the queen&#x27;s popularity, but also because the queen had abdicated in favor of the king on the condition that she would succeed him if he (being twelve years older) should die before her, a condition which did in fact make the queen the king&#x27;s heir to the throne, and during the Riksdag of 1741, when the queen stayed with her court at her summer residence Karlberg Palace, the matter of the king&#x27;s adultery was, for the second time raised in parliament by the Clergy estate, this time by Bishop Erik Benzelius, who referred to the matter as that &quot;which the Queen had made it known&quot; that they should raise, in order to &quot;set the mourning heart of the Queen to rest&quot;.
An official statement of protest was made, stating a reminder of the king&#x27;s oath always to treat the queen with respect when she abdicated in his favor, and that the whole Kingdom was in mourning of the queen&#x27;s sorrow, and concerned for the welfare of the king&#x27;s soul. Two delegations from the Clergy estate were appointed: one to the king, and one to Hedvig Taube.

In July 1741, the statement was read to the king in his audience chamber. The king reacted with rage, refused to accept the statement and stated that the Riksdag of the Estates had promised him not to interfere in his private life. He was, on their second attempt, forced to receive the statement.
When Bishop Schröder reported the result of the audience with the king to the queen, Ulrika Eleonora insisted that the planned embassy to Hedvig Taube was also to be executed according to plan, and replied to the hesitation of the bishop with the words: &quot;When You priests follow your calling and your conscience, you do well to do so with no concern of other matters.&quot;

When the delegation arrived to Hedvig Taube early that morning, she excused herself claiming to be bedridden and ill, but the priests then entered her bedroom, and she was forced to receive them lying in bed. She told them that she could not see why the Riksdag of the Estates should have an interest for her, as she never involved in politics, but was met with the reply that their business was in the welfare of the soul of the king and herself.
She covered her face with a sheet and answered crying: &quot;It would have been well, if this had been prevented twelve years ago, when I was too young to protect myself&quot;. The delegation expressed sympathy with the fact that she had been led to sin, but that she should not continue with it now that she had been made aware of it, and leave the capital: &quot;Your Ladyship should consider, how greatly she displeases the most honorable Queen of us all, who laments herself because of it, to the point of shortening her life span out of grief, to great damage of our fatherland.&quot;
Upon this, she answered: &quot;I have never been led to see, that Her Majesty has been ungracious or displeased in this matter&quot; and was given the reply: &quot;We can assure Your ladyship that it is so, and how else could it be?&quot;
The delegation then read the statement, &quot;Her ladyship should consider, that she with her conduct for so long has broken her duty as her subject to her royal majesty, her gracious sovereign as well as that of us all&quot;, and left the document with her.
Hedvig Taube, however, returned to her former position and her residence in the capital as soon as the Riksdag of 1741 was dissolved.

== Later life ==

In accordance with the abdication document of 1720, were the queen abdicated in favor of the king on condition that she succeed him if he should die before her, the queen had in effect been the heir to the throne of Sweden. Upon her death in November 1741, the question of succession to the Swedish throne was raised. Hedvig Taube, who was well aware that her exile was due to the efforts of the British- and Hessian supported Capts party, was expected to support the French-supported Hats party. The French ambassador to Sweden, Marc Antoine Frond de Beaupoil marquis de Lanmary, courted her and presented her with a set of golden tableware and her sons appointed French colonels to secure her support of the French candidate in the election of an heir to the Swedish throne: Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken. It was during this period, that Taube reportedly had hopes to marry the king and have her own sons becoming heir to the throne. When she lost hopes of this, she accepted to support the French candidate. On 29 March 1742 her sons were made Swedish counts, and 2 February 1743 she was made Holy Roman Countess of Hessenstein.

During the Dalecarlian Rebellion (1743), when the rebellious peasants marched to the capital in support of the Danish candidate and protest toward the Hats government, she, as well as Fredrik Gyllenborg, Carl Gustaf Tessin, Anders von Höpken and many other figures of the Hats party left the city fearing for their safety. In 1743, the Russian candidate Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp was elected heir to the throne. In December, the crown prince was brought to her in secret during the night in company only with the king, a courtier and Erland Broman, and unofficially introduced to her while she lay confined to her bed in pregnancy. During the visit, she begged to crown prince for protection of her and her children. After the visit, the crown prince remarked, that he understood the king&#x27;s affection, and that he would never have thought Hedvig Taube to be so beautiful and charming.

Hedvig Taube died due to childbirth. Her last pregnancy was very difficult, and during it, she was overheard cursing her father and Erland Broman, throwing the king&#x27;s gifts around, and told her confessor that it would be the fault of the king if she should come to hell and that he would also be placed there if he did not better himself. According to reports, the king had plans to marry Hedvig Taube as a widower, but the plans were never realized due to her death.

In 1745, Taube was replaced as an official royal mistress by the Catharina Ebba Horn.

<doc id="322830" wikidata="Q3448005" url="?curid=322830" title="Radical centrism">
<text>Radical centrism, also called the radical center, the radical centre, and the radical middle, is a concept that arose in Western nations in the late 20th century. The &quot;radical&quot; in the term refers to a willingness on the part of most radical centrists to call for fundamental reform of institutions. The &quot;centrism&quot; refers to a belief that genuine solutions require realism and pragmatism, not just idealism and emotion.

One radical centrist text defines radical centrism as &quot;idealism without illusions&quot;, a phrase originally from John F. Kennedy. Radical centrists borrow ideas from the political left and the political right, often melding them. Most support market economy-based solutions to social problems, with strong governmental oversight in the public interest. There is support for increased global engagement and the growth of an empowered middle class in developing countries. In the United States, many radical centrists work within the major political parties; they also support independent or third-party initiatives and candidacies.

One common criticism of radical centrism is that its policies are only marginally different from conventional centrist policies. Some observers see radical centrism as primarily a process of catalyzing dialogue and fresh thinking among polarized people and groups.

== Influences and precursors ==
Some influences on radical centrist political philosophy are not directly political. Robert C. Solomon, a philosopher with radical-centrist interests, identifies a number of philosophical concepts supporting balance, reconciliation or synthesis, including Confucius&#x27; concept of &quot;ren&quot;, Aristotle&#x27;s concept of the mean, Desiderius Erasmus&#x27;s and Michel de Montaigne&#x27;s humanism, Giambattista Vico&#x27;s evolutionary vision of history, William James&#x27; and John Dewey&#x27;s pragmatism, and Aurobindo Ghose&#x27;s integration of opposites.
However, most commonly cited influences and precursors are from the political realm. For example, British radical-centrist politician Nick Clegg considers himself an heir to political theorist John Stuart Mill, former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George, economist John Maynard Keynes, social reformer William Beveridge and former Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond. The single tax movement and subsequent Georgist movement begun by 19th century journalist and political theorist Henry George with his landmark work &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; has long attracted thinkers and activists from all sides of the political spectrum. In his book &quot;Independent Nation&quot; (2004), John Avlon discusses precursors of 21st-century U.S. political centrism, including President Theodore Roosevelt, Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, and Senator Edward Brooke. Radical centrist writer Mark Satin points to political influences from outside the electoral arena, including communitarian thinker Amitai Etzioni, magazine publisher Charles Peters, management theorist Peter Drucker, city planning theorist Jane Jacobs and futurists Heidi and Alvin Toffler. Satin calls Benjamin Franklin the radical middle&#x27;s favorite Founding Father since he was &quot;extraordinarily practical&quot;, &quot;extraordinarily creative&quot; and managed to &quot;get the warring factions and wounded egos to transcend their differences&quot;.

== Late 20th-century groundwork ==
=== Initial definitions ===
According to journalist William Safire, the phrase &quot;radical middle&quot; was coined by Renata Adler, a staff writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In the introduction to her second collection of essays, &quot;Toward a Radical Middle&quot; (1969), she presented it as a healing radicalism. Adler said it rejected the violent posturing and rhetoric of the 1960s in favor of such &quot;corny&quot; values as &quot;reason, decency, prosperity, human dignity [and human] contact&quot;. She called for the &quot;reconciliation&quot; of the white working class and African-Americans.

In the 1970s, sociologist Donald I. Warren described the radical center as consisting of those &quot;middle American radicals&quot; who were suspicious of big government, the national media and academics, as well as rich people and predatory corporations. Although they might vote for Democrats or Republicans, or for populists like George Wallace, they felt politically homeless and were looking for leaders who would address their concerns.
In the 1980s and 1990s, several authors contributed their understandings to the concept of the radical center. For example, futurist Marilyn Ferguson added a holistic dimension to the concept when she said: &quot;[The] Radical Center ... is not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road&quot;. Sociologist Alan Wolfe located the creative part of the political spectrum at the center: &quot;The extremes of right and left know where they stand, while the center furnishes what is original and unexpected&quot;. African-American theorist Stanley Crouch upset many political thinkers when he pronounced himself a &quot;radical pragmatist&quot;. Crouch explained: &quot;I affirm whatever I think has the best chance of working, of being both inspirational and unsentimental, of reasoning across the categories of false division and beyond the decoy of race&quot;.

In his influential 1995 &quot;Newsweek&quot; cover story &quot;Stalking the Radical Middle&quot;, journalist Joe Klein described radical centrists as angrier and more frustrated than conventional Democrats and Republicans. Klein said they share four broad goals: getting money out of politics, balancing the budget, restoring civility and figuring out how to run government better. He also said their concerns were fueling &quot;what is becoming a significant intellectual movement, nothing less than an attempt to replace the traditional notions of liberalism and conservatism&quot;.

=== Relations to the Third Way ===
In 1998, British sociologist Anthony Giddens claimed that the radical center is synonymous with the Third Way. For Giddens, an advisor to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and for many other European political actors, the Third Way is a reconstituted form of social democracy.

Some radical centrist thinkers do not equate radical centrism with the Third Way. In Britain, many do not see themselves as social democrats. Most prominently, British radical-centrist politician Nick Clegg has made it clear he does not consider himself an heir to Tony Blair and Richard Reeves, Clegg&#x27;s longtime advisor, emphatically rejects social democracy.

In the United States, the situation is different because the term Third Way was adopted by the Democratic Leadership Council and other moderate Democrats. However, most U.S. radical centrists also avoid the term. Ted Halstead and Michael Lind&#x27;s introduction to radical centrist politics fails to mention it and Lind subsequently accused the organized moderate Democrats of siding with the &quot;center-right&quot; and Wall Street. Radical centrists have expressed dismay with what they see as &quot;split[ting] the difference&quot;, &quot;triangulation&quot; and other supposed practices of what some of them call the &quot;mushy middle&quot;.

== 21st-century overviews ==

The first years of the 21st century saw publication of four introductions to radical centrist politics: Ted Halstead and Michael Lind&#x27;s &quot;The Radical Center&quot; (2001), Matthew Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Two Percent Solution&quot; (2003), John Avlon&#x27;s &quot;Independent Nation&quot; (2004) and Mark Satin&#x27;s &quot;Radical Middle&quot; (2004). These books attempted to take the concept of radical centrism beyond the stage of &quot;cautious gestures&quot; and journalistic observation and define it as a political philosophy.

The authors came to their task from diverse political backgrounds: Avlon had been a speechwriter for New York Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; Miller had been a business consultant before serving in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s budget office; Lind had been an exponent of Harry Truman-style &quot;national liberalism&quot;; Halstead had run a think tank called Redefining Progress; and Satin had co-drafted the U.S. Green Party&#x27;s foundational political statement, &quot;Ten Key Values&quot;. However, there is a generational bond: all these authors were between 31 and 41 years of age when their books were published (except for Satin, who was nearing 60).

While the four books do not speak with one voice, among them they express assumptions, analyses, policies and strategies that helped set the parameters for radical centrism as a 21st-century political philosophy:

=== Assumptions ===

* Our problems cannot be solved by twiddling the dials; substantial reforms are needed in many areas.
* Solving our problems will not require massive infusions of new money.
* However, solving our problems will require drawing on the best ideas from left and right and wherever else they may be found.
* It will also require creative and original ideas – thinking outside the box.
* Such thinking cannot be divorced from the world as it is, or from tempered understandings of human nature. A mixture of idealism and realism is needed. &quot;Idealism without realism is impotent&quot;, says John Avlon. &quot;Realism without idealism is empty&quot;.

=== Analysis ===
* North America and Western Europe have entered an Information Age economy, with new possibilities that are barely being tapped.
* In this new age, a plurality of people is neither liberal nor conservative, but independent and looking to move in a more appropriate direction.
* Nevertheless, the major political parties are committed to ideas developed in, and for, a different era; and are unwilling or unable to realistically address the future.
* Most people in the Information Age want to maximize the amount of choice they have in their lives.
* In addition, people are insisting that they be given a fair opportunity to succeed in the new world they are entering.

=== General policies ===

* An overriding commitment to fiscal responsibility, even if it entails means-testing of social programs.
* An overriding commitment to reforming public education, whether by equalizing spending on school districts, offering school choice, hiring better teachers, or empowering the principals and teachers we have now.
* A commitment to market-based solutions in health care, energy, the environment, etc., so long as the solutions are carefully regulated by government to serve the public good. The policy goal, says Matthew Miller, is to &quot;harness market forces for public purposes&quot;.
* A commitment to provide jobs for everyone willing to work, whether by subsidizing jobs in the private sector or by creating jobs in the public sector.
* A commitment to need-based rather than race-based affirmative action; more generally, a commitment to race-neutral ideals.
* A commitment to participate in institutions and processes of global governance; and be of genuine assistance to people in the developing nations.

=== Strategy ===
* A new political majority can be built, whether it be seen to consist largely of Avlon&#x27;s political independents, Satin&#x27;s &quot;caring persons&quot;, Miller&#x27;s balanced and pragmatic individuals, or Halstead and Lind&#x27;s triad of disaffected voters, enlightened business leaders, and young people.
* National political leadership is important; local and nonprofit activism is not enough.
* Political process reform is also important – for example, implementing rank-order voting in elections and providing free media time to candidates.
* A radical centrist party should be created, assuming one of the major parties cannot simply be won over by radical centrist thinkers and activists.
* In the meantime, particular independent, major-party or third-party candidacies should be supported.

== Idea creation and dissemination ==
Along with publication of the four overviews of radical centrist politics, the first part of the 21st century saw a rise in the creation and dissemination of radical centrist policy ideas.

=== Think tanks and mass media ===

Several think tanks are developing radical centrist ideas. By the early 2000s, these included Demos in Britain; the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership in Australia; and New America (formerly the New America Foundation) in the United States. New America was started by authors Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, as well as two others, to bring radical centrist ideas to Washington, D.C. journalists and policy researchers.

In the 2010s, new think tanks began promoting radical centrist ideas. &quot;Radix: Think Tank for the Radical Centre&quot; was established in London in 2016; its initial board of trustees included former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Radix policy director David Boyle called for &quot;big, radical ideas&quot; that could break with both trickle-down conservatism and backward-looking socialism. In 2018, a policy document released by the then four-year-old Niskanen Center of Washington, D.C. was characterized as a &quot;manifesto for radical centrism&quot; by Big Think writer Paul Ratner. According to Ratner, the document – signed by some of Niskanen&#x27;s executives and policy analysts – is an attempt to &quot;incorporate rival ideological positions into a way forward&quot; for America.

A radical centrist perspective can also be found in major periodicals. In the United States, for example, &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot; was started by early radical centrist thinker Charles Peters and many large-circulation magazines publish articles by New America fellows. Columnists who have written from a radical centrist perspective include John Avlon, Thomas Friedman, Joe Klein, and Matthew Miller. Prominent journalists James Fallows and Fareed Zakaria have been identified as radical centrists.

In Britain, the news magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; positions itself as radical centrist. An editorial (&quot;leader&quot;) in 2012 declared in bolded type: &quot;A new form of radical centrist politics is needed to tackle inequality without hurting economic growth&quot;. An essay on &quot;The Economist&quot;″s website the following year, introduced by the editor, argues that the magazine had always &quot;com[e] ... from what we like to call the radical centre&quot;.

=== Books on specific topics ===

Many books offer radical centrist perspectives and policy proposals on topics including foreign policy, environmentalism, food and agriculture, underachievement among minorities, women and men, bureaucracy and overregulation, economics, international relations, political dialogue, political organization and what one person can do.
* In &quot;Ethical Realism&quot; (2006), British liberal Anatol Lieven and U.S. conservative John Hulsman advocate a foreign policy based on modesty, principle and seeing ourselves as others see us.
* In &quot;Break Through&quot; (2007), environmental strategists Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute call on activists to become more comfortable with pragmatism, high-technology and aspirations for human greatness.
* In &quot;Food from the Radical Center&quot; (2018), ecologist Gary Paul Nabhan proposes agricultural policies intended to unite left and right as well as improve the food supply.
* In &quot;Winning the Race&quot; (2005), linguist John McWhorter says that many African Americans are negatively affected by a cultural phenomenon he calls &quot;therapeutic alienation&quot;.
* In &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; (2016), Anne-Marie Slaughter of New America rethinks feminist assumptions and presents new visions of how women and men can flourish.
* In &quot;Try Common Sense&quot; (2019), attorney Philip K. Howard urges the national government to set broad goals and standards, and leave interpretation to those closest to the ground.
* In &quot;The Origin of Wealth&quot; (2006), Eric Beinhocker of the Institute for New Economic Thinking portrays the economy as a dynamic but imperfectly self-regulating evolutionary system and suggests policies that could support benign socio-economic evolution.
* In &quot;How to Run the World&quot; (2011), scholar Parag Khanna argues that the emerging world order should not be run from the top down, but by a galaxy of nonprofit, nation-state, corporate and individual actors cooperating for their mutual benefit.
* In &quot;The Righteous Mind&quot; (2012), social psychologist Jonathan Haidt says we can conduct useful political dialogue only after acknowledging the strengths in our opponents&#x27; ways of thinking.
* In &quot;Voice of the People&quot; (2008), conservative activist Lawrence Chickering and liberal attorney James Turner attempt to lay the groundwork for a grassroots &quot;transpartisan&quot; movement across the U.S.
* In his memoir &quot;Radical Middle: Confessions of an Accidental Revolutionary&quot; (2010), South African journalist Denis Beckett tries to show that one person can make a difference in a situation many might regard as hopeless.

== Political action ==

Radical centrists have been and continue to be engaged in a variety of political activities.

=== Armenia ===
Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan has been described as a radical centrist. His Civil Contract party won a supermajority of seats in the National Assembly following the 2021 Armenian parliamentary election.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, Aboriginal lawyer Noel Pearson is building an explicitly radical centrist movement among Aboriginal people. The movement is seeking more assistance from the Australian state, but is also seeking to convince individual Aboriginal people to take more responsibility for their lives. To political philosopher Katherine Curchin, writing in the &quot;Australian Journal of Political Science&quot;, Pearson is attempting something unusual and worthwhile: casting public debate on indigenous issues in terms of a search for a radical centre. She says Pearson&#x27;s methods have much in common with those of deliberative democracy. The Indigenous Voice to Parliament (which failed in a referendum in 2023) was developed as a radical centrist solution to the problem of Indigenous constitutional recognition. It attempted to synthesise progressive concerns that constitutional recognition must involve structural reform and not &quot;mere symbolism&quot; with conservative concerns that any change must not limit parliamentary sovereignty and &quot;minimise legal uncertainty&quot;.

While not using the term formally, the political party Science Party is founded on principles that are typical of the radical centre.

=== Brazil ===
In the late 2010s, Brazil&#x27;s Marina Silva was identified by &quot;The Economist&quot; as an emerging radical-centrist leader. Formerly a member of the left-wing Workers&#x27; Party, by 2017 she had organized a new party whose watchwords included environmentalism, liberalism, and &quot;clean politics&quot;. She had already served six years as Minister of the Environment, and in 2010 she was the Green Party candidate for President of Brazil, finishing third with 20% of the vote.

The Social Democratic Party, a breakaway of the Democrats founded in 2011, is a self-described radical centrist party.

=== Canada ===

In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau claimed that his Liberal Party adhered to the &quot;radical centre&quot;. One thing this means, Trudeau said, is that &quot;sometimes we have to fight against the state&quot;. Paul Hellyer, who served in Trudeau&#x27;s first cabinet and spent over half a century in Canadian political life, said in 2010, &quot;I have been branded as everything from far left to far right. I put myself in the radical centre – one who seeks solutions to problems based on first principles without regard to ideology. I believe that it is the kind of solution the world desperately needs at a time when niggling change or fine tuning is not good enough&quot;.

=== Chile ===
In 2017, &quot;The Economist&quot; described Chile&#x27;s Andrés Velasco as a rising radical-centrist politician. A former finance minister in Michelle Bachelet&#x27;s first government, he later unsuccessfully ran against her for the presidential nomination and then helped establish a new political party. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Velasco and his colleagues say they support a political philosophy that is both liberal and egalitarian. Like Amartya Sen, they see freedom not just as freedom-from, but as the absence of domination and the opportunity to fulfill one&#x27;s potential. Like John Rawls, they reject the far left&#x27;s emphasis on state redistribution in favor of an emphasis on equal treatment for all with special vigilance against class- and race-based discrimination.

=== Finland ===
Finland&#x27;s Centre Party has been generally viewed as a radical centrist party, with wide-ranging views from the left and right-wing political spectrums, such as supporting lower taxes for businesses and lowering the capital gains tax, while also encompassing strong welfare and environmental policies and legislation. The Centre Party&#x27;s former chairmen and Finland&#x27;s former Prime Ministers, Juha Sipilä and Matti Vanhanen as well as former President Urho Kekkonen have been viewed as radical centrists.

=== France ===

Several observers have identified Emmanuel Macron, elected President of France in 2017, as a radical centrist. Anne Applebaum of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; says Macron &quot;represents the brand-new radical center&quot;, as does his political movement, En Marche!, which Applebaum translates as &quot;forward&quot;. She notes a number of politically bridging ideas Macron holds – for example, &quot;He embraces markets, but says he believes in &#x27;collective solidarity. A professor of history, Robert Zaretsky, writing in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, argues that Macron&#x27;s radical centrism is &quot;the embodiment of a particularly French kind of center – the extreme center&quot;. He points to Macron&#x27;s declaration that he is &quot;neither left nor right&quot;, and to his support for policies, such as public-sector austerity and major environmental investments , that traditional political parties might find contradictory.

U.S. politician Dave Anderson, writing in &quot;The Hill&quot; newspaper, says that Macron&#x27;s election victory points the way for those &quot;who wish to transcend their polarized politics of [the present] in the name of a new center, not a moderate center associated with United States and United Kingdom &#x27;Third Way&#x27; politics but what has been described as Macron&#x27;s &#x27;radical center&#x27; point of view. … [It] transcends left and right but takes important elements of both sides&quot;.

=== Germany ===
Writing at The Dahrendorf Forum, a joint project of the Hertie School of Governance (Berlin) and the London School of Economics, Forum fellow Alexandru Filip put the German Green party of 2018 in the same camp as Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s French party (see above) and Albert Rivera&#x27;s Spanish one (see below). His article &quot;On New and Radical Centrism&quot; argued that the Greens did relatively well in the 2017 German federal election not only because of their stance against the &quot;system&quot; but also as a result of &quot;a more centrist, socio-liberal, pro-European constituency that felt alienated by the power-sharing cartel&quot; of the larger parties.

=== Israel ===

In an article for &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; in 2012, conservative Knesset member Tzipi Hotovely named Israeli politician Yair Lapid and his Yesh Atid (There Is a Future) party as examples of &quot;the radical center&quot; in Israel, which she warned her readers against. In 2013, Yossi Klein Halevi – author of books addressing Israelis and Palestinians alike – explained why he voted for Lapid, saying, in part:

He emerged as the voice of middle class disaffection, yet included in his [party] list two Ethiopians, representatives of one of the country&#x27;s poorest constituencies. ... Yair has sought dialogue. ... Some see Yair&#x27;s Israeli eclecticism as an expression of ideological immaturity, of indecisiveness. In fact it reflects his ability – alone among today&#x27;s leaders – to define the Israeli center. ... These voters agree with the left about the dangers of occupation and with the right about the dangers of a delusional peace.

In 2017, Lapid and his party were surging in the polls. In May 2020, following three elections, Lapid was named leader of the opposition in Israel. A month prior, Lapid had written an essay in which he described his version of centrism as &quot;the politics of the broad consensus that empowers us all. Together, we are creating something new&quot;.

=== Italy ===
According to journalist Angelo Persichilli, Italian Christian Democratic Party leader Aldo Moro&#x27;s call for a &quot;parallel convergence&quot; prefigured today&#x27;s calls for radical centrism. Until being killed by the Red Brigades in the late 1970s, Moro had been promoting a political alliance between Christian Democracy and the Italian Communist Party. Moro acknowledged that the two parties were so different that they ran on parallel tracks and he did not want them to lose their identities, but he emphasized that in the end their interests were convergent – hence the phrase &quot;parallel convergence&quot;, which he popularized.

In the 2010s, Spanish radical centrist Albert Rivera reportedly cited Italian politician Matteo Renzi as a soulmate.

=== Netherlands ===
According to the Dutch opinion magazine &quot;HP/De Tijd&quot;, the Dutch political party D66 can be seen as radical centrist. Radical centrism is a possibility in another Dutch party as well. In a report presented in 2012 to the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) party, CDA member and former minister of social affairs Aart Jan de Geus recommends that the CDA develop itself into a radical centrist &quot;(&quot;radicale midden&quot;)&quot; party. The D66 has been seen as the more progressive and individualistic of the two parties, and the CDA as the more conservative and personalistic / communitarian.

=== New Zealand ===
The Opportunities Party (TOP), founded by economist Gareth Morgan, identifies itself as radical centrist. TOP advocates for evidence-based policy on a universal basic income, legalised cannabis, and putting a stop to the New Zealand housing crisis.

=== South Korea ===
In South Korea, the term &quot;Jungdogaehyeok&quot; () bears resemblance to the term radical centrism. The Peace Democratic Party, founded in 1987, officially put forward a &quot;jungdogaehyeok&quot;. But from then until 2016, the term was rarely used in South Korean politics.

After 2016, the People&#x27;s Party, the Bareunmirae Party, the Party for Democracy and Peace, the New Alternatives party, the Minsaeng Party, and the People Party all called themselves &quot;jungdogaehyeok&quot;.

South Korean politician Ahn Cheol-soo has described himself explicitly as a &quot;radical centrist&quot; ().

=== Spain ===

In Spain, Albert Rivera and his Ciudadanos (Citizens) party have been described as radical centrist by &quot;Politico&quot;, as well as by Spanish-language commentators and news outlets. Rivera himself has described his movement as radical centrist, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re the radical center. We can&#x27;t beat them when it comes to populism. What Ciudadanos aspires to is radical, courageous changes backed by numbers, data, proposals, economists, technicians and capable people&quot;. Rivera has called for politics to transcend the old labels, saying, &quot;We have to move away from the old left-right axis&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; has likened Rivera and his party to Emmanuel Macron and his party En Marche! in France. Rivera&#x27;s party has taken on the established parties of the left and right and has had some success, most notably in the 2017 Catalan regional election. In the subsequent years, though, Ciudadanos became almost irrelevant in Spanish politics, leading to Rivera&#x27;s resignation as party leader.

=== United Kingdom ===
Following the 2010 election, Nick Clegg, then leader of the Liberal Democrats (Britain&#x27;s third-largest party at the time), had his party enter into a Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement to form a majority government. In a speech to party members in the spring of 2011, Clegg declared that he considers himself and his party to be radical centrist:

For the left, an obsession with the state. For the right, a worship of the market. But as liberals, we place our faith in people. People with power and opportunity in their hands. Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right. But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal. We are liberals and we own the freehold to the centre ground of British politics. Our politics is the politics of the radical centre.

In the autumn of 2012, Clegg&#x27;s longtime policy advisor elaborated on the differences between Clegg&#x27;s identity as a &quot;radical liberal&quot; and traditional social democracy. He stated that Clegg&#x27;s conception of liberalism rejected &quot;statism, paternalism, insularity and narrow egalitarianism&quot;.

=== United States ===
Some commentators identify Ross Perot&#x27;s 1992 U.S. presidential campaign as the first radical centrist national campaign. However, many radical centrist authors were not enthusiastic about Perot. Matthew Miller acknowledges that Perot had enough principle to support a gasoline tax hike, Halstead and Lind note that he popularized the idea of balancing the budget and John Avlon says he crystallized popular distrust of partisan extremes. However, none of those authors examines Perot&#x27;s ideas or campaigns in depth and Mark Satin does not mention Perot at all. Joe Klein mocked one of Perot&#x27;s campaign gaffes and said he was not a sufficiently substantial figure. Miller characterizes Perot as a rich, self-financed lone wolf. By contrast, what most radical centrists say they want in political action terms is the building of a grounded political movement.

The phrase &quot;militant moderates&quot; was used by national media during Perot&#x27;s 1992 groundbreaking presidential campaign. One of Perot&#x27;s most intriguing contributions to American politics is his challenge to the entire paradigm of &quot;left-center-right.&quot; He claimed at a meeting of the national Reform Party in 1995 that the paradigm was no longer operative and that left-center-right was being replaced. The replacement was a &quot;top versus the rest of us&quot; paradigm, and that the very wealthy like himself, could choose to be with the people at the &quot;bottom, like most of the American people.&quot; This brand of &quot;militant moderation&quot;—a form of populism—is what endeared Perot to his ardent followers and was not traditional &quot;centrism.&quot;

Also in the 1990s, political independents Jesse Ventura, Angus King and Lowell Weicker became governors of American states. According to John Avlon, they pioneered the combination of fiscal prudence and social tolerance that has served as a model for radical centrist governance ever since. They also developed a characteristic style, a combination of &quot;common sense and maverick appeal&quot;.

In the decade of the 2000s, a number of governors and mayors – most prominently, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg – were celebrated by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;action heroes&quot; who looked beyond partisanship to get things done. A similar article that decade in &quot;Politico&quot; placed &quot;self-styled &#x27;radical centrist governor Mark Warner of Virginia in that camp.

In the 2010s, the radical centrist movement in the U.S. played out in the national media. In 2010, for example, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Thomas Friedman called for &quot;a Tea Party of the radical center&quot;, an organized national pressure group. Friedman later co-wrote a book with scholar Michael Mandelbaum discussing key issues in American society and calling for an explicitly radical centrist politics and program to deal with them. At &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, columnist Matthew Miller was explaining &quot;Why we need a third party of (radical) centrists&quot;.

In 2011, Friedman championed Americans Elect, an insurgent group of radical centrist Democrats, Republicans and independents who were hoping to run an independent presidential candidate in 2012. Meanwhile, Miller offered &quot;[t]he third-party stump speech we need&quot;. In his book &quot;The Price of Civilization&quot; (2011), Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs called for the creation of a third U.S. party, an &quot;Alliance for the Radical Center&quot;.
While no independent radical-centrist presidential candidate emerged in 2012, John Avlon emphasized the fact that independent voters remain the fastest-growing portion of the electorate.

In late 2015, the No Labels organization, co-founded by Avlon, called a national &quot;Problem Solver&quot; convention to discuss how to best reduce political polarization and promote political solutions that could bridge the left-right divide. A lengthy article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; about the convention conveys the views of leaders of a new generation of beyond-left-and-right (or both-left-and-right) organizations, including Joan Blades of Living Room Conversations, David Blankenhorn of Better Angels, Carolyn Lukensmeyer of the National Institute for Civil Discourse and Steve McIntosh of the Institute for Cultural Evolution. Following the 2016 presidential election, prominent U.S. commentator David Brooks praised No Labels and other such groups and offered them advice, including this: &quot;[D]eepen a positive national vision that is not merely a positioning between left and right&quot;.

By the mid-2010s, several exponents of radical centrism had run, albeit unsuccessfully, for seats in the United States Congress, including Matthew Miller in California and Dave Anderson in Maryland.

According to a January 2018 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin greeted newly elected Alabama Senator Doug Jones with the phrase, &quot;Welcome to the radical middle&quot;. Both senators have been regarded as moderate and bipartisan. In March 2018, the political newspaper &quot;The Hill&quot; ran an article by attorney Michael D. Fricklas entitled &quot;The Time for Radical Centrism Has Come&quot;. It asserted that the omnibus spending bill for 2018 jettisoned spending proposals favored by both political &quot;extremes&quot; to obtain votes of &quot;principled moderates&quot;, and that its passage therefore represented a victory for what Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) calls &quot;radical centrism&quot;.

Toward the beginning of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Steven Teles of the Niskanen Center, writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, laid out a strategy by which a dark horse candidate appealing to the radical center could win the Democratic Party presidential nomination.

The Forward Party, a political action committee created by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang in October 2021, was critically described as a radical centrist movement by the American socialist magazine, Jacobin. Two days after the creation of the Forward Party, Yang tweeted, &quot;You&#x27;re giving radical centrists like me a home.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Even before the 21st century, some observers were criticizing what they saw as radical centrism. In the 1960s, liberal political cartoonist Jules Feiffer employed the term &quot;radical middle&quot; to mock what he saw as the timid and pretentious outlook of the American political class. During the Ross Perot presidential campaign of 1992, conservative journalist William Safire suggested that a more appropriate term for the radical center might be the &quot;snarling center&quot;. In a 1998 article entitled &quot;The Radical Centre: A Politics Without Adversary&quot;, Belgian political theorist Chantal Mouffe argued that passionate and often bitter conflict between left and right is a necessary feature of any democracy.

=== Objections to policies, assumptions and attitudes ===

Some 21st-century commentators argue that radical centrist policies are not substantially different from conventional centrist ideas. For example, US liberal journalist Robert Kuttner says there already is a radical centrist party –&quot;It&#x27;s called the Democrats&quot;. He faults Matthew Miller&#x27;s version of radical centrism for offering &quot;feeble&quot; policy solutions and indulging in wishful thinking about the motives of the political right. Progressive social theorist Richard Kahlenberg says that Ted Halstead and Michael Lind&#x27;s book &quot;The Radical Center&quot; is too skeptical about the virtues of labor unions and too ardent about the virtues of the market.

Others contend that radical centrist policies lack clarity. For example, in 2001 journalist Eric Alterman said that the New America Foundation think tank was neither liberal nor progressive and did not know what it was.

&quot;Politico&quot; reports that some think Spain&#x27;s radical centrist Ciudadanos (Citizens) party is &quot;encouraged by the Spanish establishment&quot; to undercut the radical left and preserve the status quo.
By contrast, some observers claim that radical centrist ideas are too different from mainstream policies to be viable. Sam Tanenhaus, the editor of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, called the proposals in Halstead and Lind&#x27;s book &quot;utopian&quot;. According to Ed Kilgore, the policy director of the Democratic Leadership Council, Mark Satin&#x27;s &quot;Radical Middle&quot; book &quot;ultimately places him in the sturdy tradition of &#x27;idealistic&#x27; American reformers who think smart and principled people unencumbered by political constraints can change everything&quot;.

Some have suggested that radical centrists may be making false assumptions about their effectiveness or appeal. In the United States, for example, political analyst James Joyner found that states adopting non-partisan redistricting commissions, a favorite radical-centrist proposal, have been no more fiscally responsible than states without such commissions. In 2017, &quot;The Economist&quot; wondered whether Latin Americans really wanted to hear the &quot;hard truths&quot; about their societies that some radical centrists were offering them.

Radical centrist attitudes have also been criticized. For example, many bloggers have characterized Thomas Friedman&#x27;s columns on radical centrism as elitist and glib. In Australia, some think that Australian attorney Noel Pearson – long an advocate of radical centrism – is in fact a &quot;polarizing partisan&quot;. In 2012, conservative Knesset member Tzipi Hotovely criticized Israel&#x27;s radical center for lacking such attributes as courage, decisiveness, and realistic thinking.

=== Objections to strategies ===

Some observers question the wisdom of seeking consensus, post-partisanship or reconciliation in political life. Political scientist Jonathan Bernstein argues that American democratic theory from the time of James Madison&#x27;s Federalist No. 10 (1787) has been based on the acknowledgement of faction and the airing of debate, and he sees no reason to change now.

Other observers feel radical centrists are misreading the political situation. For example, conservative journalist Ramesh Ponnuru says liberals and conservatives are not ideologically opposed to such radical centrist measures as limiting entitlements and raising taxes to cover national expenditures. Instead, voters are opposed to them and things will change when voters can be convinced otherwise.

The third-party strategy favored by many U.S. radical centrists has been criticized as impractical and diversionary. According to these critics, what is needed instead is (a) reform of the legislative process; and (b) candidates in existing political parties who will support radical centrist ideas. The specific third-party vehicle favored by many U.S. radical centrists in 2012 – Americans Elect – was criticized as an &quot;elite-driven party&quot; supported by a &quot;dubious group of Wall Street multi-millionaires&quot;.

After spending time with a variety of radical centrists, Alec MacGillis of &quot;The New Republic&quot; concluded that their perspectives are so disparate that they could never come together to build a viable political organization.

=== Internal concerns ===
Some radical centrists are less than sanguine about their future. One concern is co-optation. For example, Michael Lind worries that the enthusiasm for the term radical center, on the part of &quot;arbiters of the conventional wisdom&quot;, may signal a weakening of the radical vision implied by the term.

Another concern is passion. John Avlon fears that some centrists cannot resist the lure of passionate partisans, whom he calls &quot;wingnuts&quot;. By contrast, Mark Satin worries that radical centrism, while &quot;thoroughly sensible&quot;, lacks an &quot;animating passion&quot; – and claims there has never been a successful political movement without one.

== As dialogue and process ==

Some radical centrists, such as theorist Tom Atlee, mediator Mark Gerzon, and activist Joseph F. McCormick, see radical centrism as primarily a commitment to process. Their approach is to facilitate processes of structured dialogue among polarized people and groups, from the neighborhood level on up. A major goal is to enable dialogue participants to come up with new perspectives and solutions that can address every party&#x27;s core interests. &quot;Onward Christian Athletes&quot; author Tom Krattenmaker speaks of the radical center as that (metaphoric) space where such dialogue and innovation can occur. Similarly, &quot;The Lipstick Proviso: Women, Sex, and Power in the Real World&quot; author Karen Lehrman Bloch speaks of the radical middle as a &quot;common ground&quot; where left and right can &quot;nurture a saner society&quot;.

Organizations seeking to catalyze dialogue and innovation among diverse people and groups have included AmericaSpeaks, C1 World Dialogue, Everyday Democracy, Listening Project (North Carolina), Living Room Conversations, Public Conversations Project, Search for Common Ground, and Village Square. Organizations specifically for university students include BridgeUSA and Sustained Dialogue. The city of Portland, Oregon has been characterized as &quot;radical middle&quot; in &quot;USA Today&quot; newspaper because many formerly antagonistic groups there are said to be talking to, learning from and working with one another.

In 2005, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; portrayed Egyptian Islamic cleric Ali Gomaa as the voice of an emergent form of radical Islam – &quot;traditionalism without the extremism&quot;. In 2012, in an article entitled &quot;The Radical Middle: Building Bridges Between the Muslim and Western Worlds, Gomaa shared his approach to the dialogic process:
The purpose of dialogue should not be to convert others, but rather to share with them one&#x27;s principles. Sincere dialogue should strengthen one&#x27;s faith while breaking down barriers. ... Dialogue is a process of exploration and coming to know the other, as much as it is an example of clarifying one&#x27;s own positions. Therefore, when one dialogues with others, what is desired is to explore their ways of thinking, so as to correct misconceptions in our own minds and arrive at common ground.

In 2017, former American football player and Green Beret soldier Nate Boyer suggested that his &quot;radical middle&quot; stance could help address the issues and resolve the controversy surrounding U.S. national anthem protests at football games.

<text>Romanians (, ; dated exonym &quot;Vlachs&quot;) are a Romance-speaking ethnic group and nation native to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Sharing a common culture and ancestry, they speak the Romanian language and live primarily in Romania and Moldova. The 2021 Romanian census found that 89.3% of Romania&#x27;s citizens identified themselves as ethnic Romanians. 

In one interpretation of the 1989 census results in Moldova, the majority of Moldovans were counted as ethnic Romanians as well. Romanians also form an ethnic minority in several nearby countries situated in Central, Southeastern, and Eastern Europe, most notably in Hungary, Serbia (including Timok), and Ukraine.

Estimates of the number of Romanian people worldwide vary from 24 to 30 million, in part depending on whether the definition of the term &quot;Romanian&quot; includes natives of both Romania and Moldova, their respective diasporas, and native speakers of both Romanian and other Eastern Romance languages. Other speakers of the latter languages are the Aromanians, the Megleno-Romanians, and the Istro-Romanians (native to Istria), all of them unevenly distributed throughout the Balkan Peninsula, which may be considered either Romanian subgroups or separated but related ethnicities.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===

The territories of modern-day Romania and Moldova were inhabited by the ancient Getae and Dacian tribes. King Burebista who reigned from 82/61 BC to 45/44 BC, was the first king who successfully unified the tribes of the Dacian kingdom, which comprised the area located between the Danube, Tisza, and Dniester rivers. King Decebalus who reigned from 87 to 106 AD was the last king of the Dacian kingdom before it was conquered by the Roman Empire in 106, after two wars between Decebalus&#x27; army and Trajan&#x27;s army. Prior to the two wars, Decebalus defeated a Roman invasion during the reign of Domitian between 86 and 88 AD.

The Roman administration retreated from Dacia between 271 and 275 AD, during the reign of emperor Aurelian under the pressure of the Goths and the Dacian Carpi tribe. The later Roman province &quot;Dacia Aureliana&quot;, was organized inside former Moesia Superior. It was reorganized as Dacia Ripensis (as a military province, devastated by an Avars invasion in 586) and Dacia Mediterranea (as a civil province, devastated by an Avar invasion in 602).

The Diocese of Dacia (circa 337–602) was a diocese of the later Roman Empire, in the area of modern-day Balkans. The Diocese of Dacia was composed of five provinces, the northernmost provinces were Dacia Ripensis (the Danubian portion of Dacia Aureliana, one of the cities of Dacia Ripensis in today Romania is Sucidava) and Moesia Prima (today in Serbia, near the border between Romania and Serbia). The territory of the diocese was devastated by the Huns in the middle of 5th century and finally overrun by the Avars and Slavs in late 6th and early 7th century.

Scythia Minor (c. 290 – c. 680) was a Roman province corresponding to the lands between the Danube and the Black Sea, today&#x27;s Dobruja divided between Romania and Bulgaria. The capital of the province was Tomis (today Constanța). According to the &quot;Laterculus Veronensis&quot; of and the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; of , Scythia belonged to the Diocese of Thrace. The indigenous population of Scythia Minor was Dacian and their material culture is apparent archaeologically into the sixth century. Roman fortifications mostly date to the Tetrarchy or the Constantinian dynasty. The province ceased to exist around 679–681, when the region was overrun by the Bulgars, which the Emperor Constantine IV was forced to recognize in 681.

=== Early Middle Ages to Late Middle Ages ===

During the Middle Ages Romanians were mostly known as Vlachs, a blanket term ultimately of Germanic origin, from the word Walha, used by ancient Germanic peoples to refer to Romance-speaking and Celtic neighbours. Besides the separation of some groups (Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians) during the Age of Migration, many Vlachs could be found all over the Balkans, in Transylvania, across Carpathian Mountains as far north as Poland and as far west as the regions of Moravia (part of the modern Czech Republic), some went as far east as Volhynia of western Ukraine, and the present-day Croatia where the Morlachs gradually disappeared, while the Catholic and Orthodox Vlachs took Croat and Serb national identity.

The first written record about a Romance language spoken in the Middle Ages in the Balkans, near the Haemus Mons is from 587 AD. A Vlach muleteer accompanying the Byzantine army noticed that the load was falling from one of the animals and shouted to a companion &quot;Torna, torna, fratre!&quot; (meaning &quot;Return, return, brother!&quot;). Theophanes the Confessor recorded it as part of a 6th-century military expedition by Comentiolus and Priscus against the Avars. Historian Gheorghe I. Brătianu considers that these words &quot;represent an expression from the Romanian language, as it was formed at that time in the Balkan and Danube regions&quot;; &quot;they probably belong to one and the most significant of the substrates on which our (&quot;Romanian&quot;) language was built&quot;.

The first definite document mentioning Romanians (Vlachs) is from the 8th century from the Konstamonitou Monastery in Mount Athos, in Greece and talks about the Vlachs of the Rynchos river (present-day North Macedonia). According to the early 13th century medieval Hungarian book Gesta Hungarorum the invading Magyars of King Árpád
(c. 845 – c. 907) waged wars against three dukes—Glad, Menumorut and the Vlach Gelou—for Banat, Crișana and Transylvania. Gesta Hungarorum also mentions the Slavs, Bulgarians, Vlachs and the shepherds of the Romans inhabiting the Carpathian Basin: &quot;sclauij, Bulgarij et Blachij, ac pastores romanorum&quot;. Most researchers identify the &quot;Blachij&quot; with the Vlachs. However the document was written between 1200 and 1230, around 300 years after the described events and some modern historians have reservations about it and find it unreliable.

Another important document mentioning Romanians (Vlachs) from the South
of the Balkan Peninsula dates back to 980. That year, the governor of Servia, Nikulitsa received the position of leader (archon) of the Vlachs from Hellas from Emperor Basil II. The function received by Nikulitsa might have been as a commander of a Vlach army. Byzantine historians usually described foreign rulers as &quot;archontes&quot;. The document signed by Basil II to give the position of archon of the Vlachs to Nekulitsa is mentioned in Strategikon of Kekaumenos (written between 1075 and 1078 AD).
After the Avar Khaganate collapsed in the 790s, the First Bulgarian Empire became the dominant power of the region, occupying lands as far as the river Tisa. The First Bulgarian Empire had a mixed population consisting of the Bulgar conquerors, Slavs and Vlachs (Romanians) but the Slavicisation of the Bulgar elite had already begun in the 9th century. Following the conquest of Southern and Central Transylvania around 830, people from the Bulgar Empire mined salt from mines in Turda, Ocna Mureș, Sărățeni and Ocnița. They traded and transported salt throughout the Bulgar Empire.

A series of Arab historians from the 10th century are some of the first to mention Vlachs in Eastern/South Eastern Europe: Mutahhar al-Maqdisi (c.945-991) writes: &quot;They say that in the Turkic neighbourhood there are the Khazars, Russians, Slavs, &quot;Waladj&quot; (Vlachs), Alans, Greeks and many other peoples&quot;. Ibn al-Nadīm (early 932–998) published in 998 the work &quot;Kitāb al-Fihrist&quot; mentioning &quot;Turks, Bulgars and Vlahs&quot; (using &quot;Blagha&quot; for Vlachs).

A series of Byzantine historians, such as George Kedrenos (circa 1000), Kekaumenos (circa 1000), John Skylitzes (early 1040s – after 1101), Anna Komnene (1083-1153), John Kinnamos (1143-1185) and Niketas Choniates (1155-1217) were some of the first to write about the Vlachs. John Skylitzes mentions the Vlachs around 976 AD, as guides and guards of Byzantine caravans in the Balkans. Between Prespa and Kastoria, they met and fought with a Bulgarian rebel named David. The Vlachs killed David in their first documented battle.
Kekaumenos&#x27;s father-in-law was Nikulitzas Delphinas, a lord of Larissa who took part in the revolt of Bulgarians and Vlachs in Thessaly in 1066 AD. The 11th-century scholar Kekaumenos wrote of a Vlach homeland situated &quot;near the Danube and [...] the Sava, where the Serbians lived more recently&quot;. He associated the Vlachs with the Dacians and the Bessi. Accordingly, historians have located this homeland in several places, including Pannonia Inferior (Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu) and Dacia Aureliana (Mátyás Gyóni).

The princess and chronicler Anna Komnene reports that in April 1091, on the eve of the decisive Byzantine-Pecheneg Battle of Levounion, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (1057-1118) was assisted by &quot;a number of 5,000 brave mountaineers and ready to attack, passed by his side, to fight alongside him&quot;. Most of the specialists who have addressed these aspects have identified those &quot; &quot;bold mountaineers&quot; &quot;, with the &#x27;Vlachs. Anna Komnene reports that in 1094, on the occasion of the Cumans&#x27; campaign south of the Danube, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos was informed about the movements of the &quot;Turanians&quot;, who had crossed the Danube by &quot;a certain Pudilos, a Vlach noble&quot;.

The Byzantine chronicler Niketas Choniates writes that in 1164, Andronikos I Komnenos, the emperor Manuel I Komnenos&#x27;s cousin, tried without success, to usurp the throne. Failing in his attempt, the Byzantine prince sought refuge in Halych but Andronikos I Komnenos was &quot;captured by the &quot;Vlachs&quot;, to whom the rumor of his escape had reached, he was taken back to the emperor&quot;.

The Byzantine chronicler John Kinnamos, presenting the campaign of Manuel I Komnenos against Hungary in 1166, reports that General Leon Vatatzes had under his command &quot;a great multitude of Vlachs, who are said to be ancient colonies of those in Italy&quot;, an army that attacked the Hungarian possessions &quot;about the lands near the Pontus called the Euxine&quot;, respectively the southeastern regions of Transylvania, &quot;destroyed everything without sparing and trampled everything it encountered in its passage&quot;.

By the 9th and 10th centuries, the nomadic Pechenegs conquered much of the steppes of Southeast Europe and the Crimean Peninsula.The Pecheneg wars against the Kievan Rus&#x27; caused some of the Slavs and Vlachs from North of the Danube to gradually migrate north of the Dniestr in the 10th and 11th centuries.

The Second Bulgarian Empire founded by the Asen dynasty consisting of Bulgarians and Vlachs was founded in 1185 and lasted until 1396. Early rulers from the Asen dynasty (particularly Kaloyan) referred to themselves as &quot;Emperors of Bulgarians and Vlachs&quot;. Later rulers, especially Ivan Asen II, styled themselves &quot;Tsars (Emperors) of Bulgarians and Romans&quot;. An alternative name used in connection with the pre-mid Second Bulgarian Empire 13th century period is the &quot;Empire of Vlachs and Bulgarians&quot;; variant names include the &quot;Vlach–Bulgarian Empire&quot;, the &quot;Bulgarian–Wallachian Empire&quot;.

Royal charters wrote of the &quot;Vlachs&#x27; land&quot; in southern Transylvania in the early 13th century, indicating the existence of autonomous Romanian communities. Papal correspondence mentions the activities of Orthodox prelates among the Romanians in Muntenia in the 1230s. Béla IV of Hungary&#x27;s land grant to the Knights Hospitallers in Oltenia and Muntenia shows that the local Vlach rulers were subject to the king&#x27;s authority in 1247.

The late 13th-century Hungarian chronicler Simon of Kéza states that the Vlachs were &quot;shepherds and husbandmen&quot; who &quot;remained in Pannonia&quot;. An unknown author&#x27;s &quot;Description of Eastern Europe&quot; from 1308 likewise states that the Vlachs &quot;were once the shepherds of the Romans&quot; who &quot;had over them ten powerful kings in the entire Messia and Pannonia&quot;.

Additionally, in medieval times there were other lands known by the name &#x27;Vlach&#x27; such as Great Vlachia, situated between Thessaly and the western Pindus mountains, of the Despotate of Epirus between the 12th-15th century. Originally within the Byzantine Empire, but after the 13th century autonomous or semi-independent. In the 12th century, the Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela, who toured the area in 1166 called the region of Thessaly &quot;Vlachia&quot;.
 The contemporary Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates however distinguishes &quot;Great Vlachia&quot; as a district near Meteora. &quot;Vlachia&quot;, &quot;Great Vlachia&quot;, and the other variants began to fall out of use for Thessaly at the turn of the 14th century, and with the emergence of the Principality of Wallachia north of the Danube in the 14th century, from the 15th century the name was reserved for it. White Wallachia, a Byzantine denomination for the region between the Danube River and the Balkans; Moravian Wallachia, a region in south-eastern Czech Republic). The names derive from the Vlachs, who had lived across much of these regions.

In the 14th century the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia emerged to fight the Ottoman Empire. During the late Middle Ages, prominent medieval Romanian monarchs such as Bogdan of Moldavia, Stephen the Great, Mircea the Elder, Michael the Brave, or Vlad the Impaler took part actively in the history of Central Europe by waging tumultuous wars and leading noteworthy crusades against the then continuously expanding Ottoman Empire, at times allied with either the Kingdom of Poland or the Kingdom of Hungary in these causes.

=== Early Modern Age to Late Modern Age ===

Eventually the entire Balkan peninsula was annexed by the Ottoman Empire. However, Moldavia and Wallachia (extending to Dobruja and Bulgaria) were not entirely subdued by the Ottomans as both principalities became autonomous (which was not the case of other Ottoman territorial possessions in Europe). Transylvania, a third region inhabited by an important majority of Romanian speakers, was a vassal state of the Ottomans until 1687, when the principality became part of the Habsburg possessions. The three principalities were united for several months in 1600 under the authority of Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave.

Up until 1541, Transylvania was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, later (due to the conquest of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire) was a self-governed Principality governed by the Hungarian nobility. In 1699 it became a part of the Habsburg lands. By the end of the 18th century, the Austrian Empire was awarded by the Ottomans with the region of Bukovina and, in 1812, the Russians occupied the eastern half of Moldavia, known as Bessarabia through the Treaty of Bucharest of 1812.

In the context of the 1848 Romanticist and liberal revolutions across Europe, the events that took place in the Grand Principality of Transylvania were the first of their kind to unfold in the Romanian-speaking territories. On the one hand, the Transylvanian Saxons and the Transylvanian Romanians (with consistent support on behalf of the Austrian Empire) successfully managed to oppose the goals of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, with the two noteworthy historical figures leading the common Romanian-Saxon side at the time being Avram Iancu and Stephan Ludwig Roth.

On the other hand, the Wallachian revolutions of 1821 and 1848 as well as the Moldavian Revolution of 1848, which aimed for independence from Ottoman and Russian foreign rulership, represented important impacts in the process of spreading the liberal ideology in the eastern and southern Romanian lands, in spite of the fact that all three eventually failed. Nonetheless, in 1859, Moldavia and Wallachia elected the same ruler, namely Alexander John Cuza (who reigned as &quot;Domnitor&quot;) and were thus unified &quot;de facto&quot;, resulting in the United Romanian Principalities for the period between 1859 and 1881.

During the 1870s, the United Romanian Principalities (then led by Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Domnitor Carol I) fought a War of Independence against the Ottomans, with Romania&#x27;s independence being formally recognised in 1878 at the Treaty of Berlin.

Although the relatively newly founded Kingdom of Romania initially allied with Austria-Hungary, Romania refused to enter World War I on the side of the Central Powers, because it was obliged to wage war only if Austria-Hungary was attacked. In 1916, Romania joined the war on the side of the Triple Entente.

As a result, at the end of the war, Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Bukovina were awarded to Romania, through a series of international peace treaties, resulting in an enlarged and far more powerful kingdom under King Ferdinand I. As of 1920, the Romanian people was believed to number over 15 million solely in the region of the Romanian kingdom, a figure larger than the populations of Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands combined.

During the interwar period, two additional monarchs came to the Romanian throne, namely Carol II and Michael I. This short-lived period was marked, at times, by political instabilities and efforts of maintaining a constitutional monarchy in favour of other, totalitarian regimes such as an absolute monarchy or a military dictatorship.

=== Contemporary Era ===

During World War II, the Kingdom of Romania lost territory both to the east and west, as Northern Transylvania became part of the Kingdom of Hungary through the Second Vienna Award, while Bessarabia and northern Bukovina were taken by the Soviets and included in the Moldavian SSR, respectively Ukrainian SSR. The eastern territory losses were facilitated by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact.

After the end of the war, the Romanian Kingdom managed to regain territories lost westward but was nonetheless not given Bessarabia and northern Bukovina back, the aforementioned regions being forcefully incorporated into the Soviet Union (USSR). Subsequently, the Soviet Union imposed a communist government and King Michael was forced to abdicate and leave for exile, subsequently settling in Switzerland, while Petru Groza remained the head of the government of the Socialist Republic of Romania (RSR). Nicolae Ceaușescu became the head of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in 1965 and his severe rule of the 1980s was ended by the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

The chaos of the 1989 revolution brought to power the dissident communist Ion Iliescu as president (largely supported by the FSN). Iliescu remained in power as head of state until 1996, when he was defeated by CDR-supported Emil Constantinescu in the 1996 general elections, the first in post-communist Romania that saw a peaceful transition of power. Following Constantinescu&#x27;s single term as president from 1996 to 2000, Iliescu was re-elected in late 2000 for another term of four years. In 2004, Traian Băsescu, the PNL-PD candidate of the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), was elected president. Five years later, Băsescu (solely supported by the PDL this time) was narrowly re-elected for a second term in the 2009 presidential elections.

In 2014, the PNL-PDL candidate (as part of the larger Christian Liberal Alliance or ACL for short; also endorsed by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania, FDGR/DFDR for short respectively) Klaus Iohannis won a surprise victory over former Prime Minister and PSD-supported contender Victor Ponta in the second round of the 2014 presidential elections. Thus, Iohannis became the first Romanian president stemming from an ethnic minority of the country (as he belongs to the Romanian-German community, being a Transylvanian Saxon). In 2019, the PNL-supported Iohannis was re-elected for a second term as president after a second round landslide victory in the 2019 Romanian presidential election (being also supported in that round by PMP and USR as well as by the FDGR/DFDR in both rounds).

In the meantime, Romania&#x27;s major foreign policy achievements were the alignment with Western Europe and the United States by joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) back in 2004 and the European Union three years later, in 2007. Current national objectives of Romania include adhering to the Schengen Area, the Eurozone as well as the OECD (i.e. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).

== Language ==

During the Middle Ages, Romanian was isolated from the other Romance languages, and borrowed words from the nearby Slavic languages (see Slavic influence on Romanian). Later on, it borrowed a number of words from German, Hungarian, and Turkish. During the modern era, most neologisms were borrowed from French and Italian, though the language has increasingly begun to adopt English borrowings.

The origins of the Romanian language, a Romance language, can be traced back to the Roman colonisation of the region. The basic vocabulary is of Latin origin, although there are some substratum words that are assumed to be of Dacian origin. It is the most spoken Eastern Romance language and is closely related to Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian, all three part of the same sub-branch of Romance languages.

The Moldovan language, in its official form, is practically identical to Romanian, although there are some differences in colloquial speech. In the de facto independent (but internationally unrecognised) region of Transnistria, the official script used to write Moldovan is Cyrillic, although Moldovan has a very limited usage in Transnistria despite its official status.

Since 2013, the Romanian Language Day is officially celebrated on 31 August in Romania. In Moldova, it is officially celebrated on the same day since 2023.

As of 2017, an Ethnologue estimation puts the (worldwide) number of Romanian speakers at approximately 24.15 million. The 24.15 million, however, represent only speakers of Romanian, not all of whom are necessarily ethnic Romanians. Also, this number does not include ethnic-Romanians who no longer speak the Romanian language.

== Names for Romanians ==
In English, Romanians are usually called Romanians and very rarely Rumanians or Roumanians, except in some historical texts, where they are called Roumans or Vlachs.

=== Etymology of the name &quot;Romanian&quot; () ===

The name &quot;Romanian&quot; is derived from Latin , meaning &quot;Roman&quot;. Under regular phonetical changes that are typical to the Romanian language, the name over the centuries transformed into . An older form of was still in use in some regions. Socio-linguistic evolutions in the late 18th century led to a gradual preponderance of the spelling form, which was then generalised during the National awakening of Romania of early 19th century.
Several historical sources show the use of the term &quot;Romanian&quot; among the medieval or early modern Romanian population. One of the earliest examples comes from the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, a German epic poem from before 1200 in which a &quot;Duke Ramunc from the land of Vlachs (Wallachia)&quot; is mentioned. &quot;Vlach&quot; was an exonym used almost exclusively for the Romanians during the Middle Ages. It has been argued by some Romanian researchers that &quot;Ramunc&quot; was not the name of the duke, but a name that highlighted his ethnicity. Other old documents, especially Byzantine or Hungarian ones, make a correlation between the old Romanians as Romans or their descendants. Several other documents, notably from Italian travelers into Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania, speak of the self-identification, language and culture of the Romanians, showing that they designated themselves as &quot;Romans&quot; or related to them in up to 30 works. One example is Tranquillo Andronico&#x27;s 1534 writing that states that the Vlachs &quot;now call themselves Romans&quot;. Another one is Francesco della Valle&#x27;s 1532 manuscripts that state that the Romanians from Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania preserved the name &quot;Roman&quot; and cites the sentence &quot;Sti Rominest?&quot; (&quot;?&quot;, &quot;do you speak Romanian?&quot;). Authors that travelled to modern Romania who wrote about it in 1574, 1575 and 1666 also noted the use of the term &quot;Romanian&quot;. From the Middle Ages, Romanians bore two names, the exonym (one given to them by foreigners) &quot;Wallachians&quot; or &quot;Vlachs&quot;, under its various forms (&quot;vlah&quot;, &quot;valah&quot;, &quot;valach&quot;, &quot;voloh&quot;, &quot;blac&quot;, &quot;olăh&quot;, &quot;vlas&quot;, &quot;ilac&quot;, &quot;ulah&quot;, etc.), and the endonym (the name they used for themselves) &quot;Romanians&quot; (/). The first mentions by Romanians of the endonym are contemporary with the earliest writings in Romanian from the sixteenth century.

According to Tomasz Kamusella, at the time of the rise of Romanian nationalism during the early 19th century, the political leaders of Wallachia and Moldavia were aware that the name &quot;România&quot; was identical to &quot;Romania&quot;, a name that had been used for the former Byzantine Empire by its inhabitants. Kamusella continues by stating that they preferred this ethnonym in order to stress their presumed link with Ancient Rome and that it became more popular as a nationalistic form of referring to all Romanian-language speakers as a distinct and separate nation during the 1820s. Raymond Detrez asserts that , derived from the Latin , acquired at a certain point the same meaning of the Greek ; that of Orthodox Christian. Wolfgang Dahmen claims that the meaning of &quot;romanus&quot; (Roman) as &quot;Christian&quot;, as opposed to &quot;pagan&quot;, which used to mean &quot;non-Roman&quot;, may have contributed to the preservation of this word as an ethonym of the Romanian people, under the meaning of &quot;Christian&quot;.

==== Daco-Romanian ====

To distinguish Romanians from the other Romanic peoples of the Balkans (Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians), the term Daco-Romanian is sometimes used to refer to those who speak the standard Romanian language and live in the former territory of ancient Dacia (today comprising mostly Romania and Moldova) and its surroundings (such as Dobruja or the Timok Valley, the latter region part of the former Roman province of Dacia Ripensis).

=== Etymology of the term Vlach ===

The name of &quot;Vlachs&quot; is an exonym that was used by Slavs to refer to all Romanized natives of the Balkans. It holds its origin from ancient Germanic—being a cognate to &quot;Welsh&quot; and &quot;Walloon&quot;—and perhaps even further back in time, from the Roman name Volcae, which was originally a Celtic tribe. From the Slavs, it was passed on to other peoples, such as the Hungarians (&quot;Oláh&quot;) and Greeks (&quot;Vlachoi&quot;) (see the Etymology section of Vlachs). Wallachia, the Southern region of Romania, takes its name from the same source.

Nowadays, the term Vlach is more often used to refer to the Romanized populations of the Balkans who speak Daco-Romanian, Aromanian, Istro-Romanian, and Megleno-Romanian.

== Romanians outside Romania ==

Most Romanians live in Romania, where they constitute a majority; Romanians also constitute a minority in the countries that neighbour Romania. Romanians can also be found in many countries, notably in the other EU countries, particularly in Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and France; in North America in the United States and Canada; in Israel; as well as in Brazil, Australia, Argentina, and New Zealand among many other countries. Italy and Spain have been popular emigration destinations, due to a relatively low language barrier, and both are each now home to about a million Romanians. With respect to geopolitical identity, many individuals of Romanian ethnicity in Moldova prefer to identify themselves as Moldovans.

The contemporary total population of ethnic Romanians cannot be stated with any degree of certainty. A disparity can be observed between official sources (such as census counts) where they exist, and estimates which come from non-official sources and interested groups. Several inhibiting factors (not unique to this particular case) contribute towards this uncertainty, which may include:

* A degree of overlap may exist or be shared between Romanian and other ethnic identities in certain situations, and census or survey respondents may elect to identify with one particular ancestry but not another, or instead identify with multiple ancestries;
* Counts and estimates may inconsistently distinguish between Romanian nationality and Romanian ethnicity (i.e. not all Romanian nationals identify with Romanian ethnicity, and vice versa);
* The measurements and methodologies employed by governments to enumerate and describe the ethnicity and ancestry of their citizens vary from country to country. Thus the census definition of &quot;Romanian&quot; might variously mean Romanian-born, of Romanian parentage, or also include other ethnic identities as Romanian which otherwise are identified separately in other contexts.

For example, the decennial US Census of 2000 calculated (based on a statistical sampling of household data) that there were 367,310 respondents indicating Romanian ancestry (roughly 0.1% of the total population).

The actual total recorded number of foreign-born Romanians was only 136,000. However, some non-specialist organisations have produced estimates which are considerably higher: a 2002 study by the Romanian-American Network Inc. mentions an estimated figure of 1,200,000 for the number of Romanian Americans. Which makes the United States home to the largest Romanian community outside Romania.

This estimate notes however that &quot;...other immigrants of Romanian national minority groups have been included such as: Armenians, Germans, Gypsies, Hungarians, Jews, and Ukrainians&quot;. It also includes an unspecified allowance for second- and third-generation Romanians, and an indeterminate number living in Canada. An error range for the estimate is not provided. For the United States 2000 Census figures, almost 20% of the total population did not classify or report an ancestry, and the census is also subject to undercounting, an incomplete (67%) response rate, and sampling error in general.

In Republika Srpska, one of the two entities constituting Bosnia and Herzegovina together with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romanians are legally recognized as an ethnic minority.

== Culture ==
=== Contributions to contemporary culture ===
Romanians have played and contributed a major role in the advancement of the arts, culture, sciences, technology and engineering.

In the history of aviation, Traian Vuia and Aurel Vlaicu built and tested some of the earliest aircraft designs, while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics. Victor Babeș discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, babesiosis; biologist Nicolae Paulescu was among the first scientists to identify insulin. Another biologist, Emil Palade, received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. George Constantinescu created the theory of sonics, while mathematician Ștefan Odobleja has been claimed as &quot;the ideological father behind cybernetics&quot; – his work &quot;The Consonantist Psychology&quot; (Paris, 1938) was supposedly the main source of inspiration for N. Wiener&#x27;s &quot;Cybernetics&quot; (Paris, 1948). Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesize amphetamine and also invented the modern method of refining crude oil.

In the arts and culture, prominent figures were George Enescu (music composer, violinist, professor of Sir Yehudi Menuhin), Constantin Brâncuși (sculptor), Eugène Ionesco (playwright), Mircea Eliade (historian of religion and novelist), Emil Cioran (essayist, Prix de l&#x27;Institut Français for stylism) and Angela Gheorghiu (soprano). More recently, filmmakers such as Cristi Puiu and Cristian Mungiu have attracted international acclaim, as has fashion designer Ioana Ciolacu.

In sports, Romanians have excelled in a variety of fields, such as football (Gheorghe Hagi), gymnastics (Nadia Comăneci, Lavinia Miloșovici etc.), tennis (Ilie Năstase, Ion Țiriac, Simona Halep), rowing (Ivan Patzaichin) and handball (four times men&#x27;s World Cup winners).
Count Dracula is a worldwide icon of Romania. This character was created by the Irish fiction writer Bram Stoker, based on some stories spread in the late Middle Ages by the frustrated German tradesmen of Kronstadt (Brașov) and on some vampire folk tales about the historic Romanian figure of Prince Vlad Țepeș.

=== Religion ===

Almost 90% of all Romanians consider themselves religious. The vast majority are Eastern Orthodox Christians, belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church (a branch of Eastern Orthodoxy, or Eastern Orthodox Church, together with the Greek Orthodox, Orthodox Church of Georgia and Russian Orthodox Churches, among others). Romanians form the third largest ethno-linguistic group among Eastern Orthodox in the world.

According to the 2022 census, 91.5% of ethnic Romanians in Romania identified themselves as Romanian Orthodox (in comparison to 73.6% of Romania&#x27;s total population, including other ethnic groups), followed by 3.6% as Protestants and 2.5% as Catholics. However, the actual rate of church attendance is significantly lower and many Romanians are only nominally believers. For example, according to a 2006 Eurobarometer poll, only 23% of Romanians attend church once a week or more. A 2006 poll conducted by the Open Society Foundations found that only 33% of Romanians attended church once a &quot;month&quot; or more.

Romanian Catholics are present in Transylvania, Banat, Bukovina, Bucharest, and parts of Moldavia, belonging to both the Roman Catholic Church (297,246 members) and the Romanian Greek Catholic Church (124,563 members). According to the 2011 Romanian census, 2.5% of ethnic Romanians in Romania identified themselves as Catholic (in comparison to 5% of Romania&#x27;s total population, including other ethnic groups). Around 1.6% of ethnic Romanians in Romania identify themselves as Pentecostal, with the population numbering 276,678 members. Smaller percentages are Protestant, Jews, Muslims, agnostic, atheist, or practice a traditional religion.

There are no official dates for the adoption of religions by the Romanians. Based on linguistic and archaeological findings, historians suggest that the Romanians&#x27; ancestors acquired polytheistic religions in the Roman era, later adopting Christianity, most likely by the 4th century AD when decreed by Emperor Constantine the Great as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Like in all other Romance languages, the basic Romanian words related to Christianity are inherited from Latin, such as &quot;God&quot; (&quot;Dumnezeu&quot; &lt; ), &quot;church&quot; ( &lt; ), &quot;cross&quot; ( &lt; , -), &quot;angel&quot; ( &lt; ), &quot;saint&quot; (regional: &lt; ), &quot;Christmas&quot; ( &lt; , -), &quot;Christian&quot; ( &lt; ), &quot;Easter&quot; ( &lt; ), &quot;sin&quot; ( &lt; ), &quot;to baptise&quot; ( &lt; ), &quot;priest&quot; ( &lt; ), &quot;to pray&quot; ( &lt; ), &quot;faith&quot; ( &lt; ), and so on.

After the Roman Catholic-Eastern Orthodox Schism of 1054, there existed a Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania for a short period of time, from 1228 to 1241. However, this seems to be the exception, rather than the rule, as in both Wallachia and Moldavia the state religion was Eastern Orthodox. Until the 17th century, the official language of the liturgy was Old Church Slavonic (a.k.a. Middle Bulgarian). Then, it gradually changed to Romanian.

=== Symbols ===

In addition to the colours of the Romanian flag, each historical province of Romania has its own characteristic symbol:
* Banat: Trajan&#x27;s Bridge
* Dobruja: Dolphin
* Moldavia : Aurochs/Wisent
* Oltenia: Lion
* Transylvania : Black eagle or Turul
* Wallachia: Eagle
The coat of arms of Romania combines these together.

== Relationship to other ethnic groups ==
The closest ethnic groups to the Romanians are the other Romanic peoples of Southeastern Europe: the Aromanians (Macedo-Romanians), the Megleno-Romanians, and the Istro-Romanians. The Istro-Romanians are the closest ethnic group to the Romanians, and it is believed they left Maramureș, Transylvania about a thousand years ago and settled in Istria, Croatia. Numbering about 500 people still living in the original villages of Istria while the majority left for other countries after World War II (mainly to Italy, United States, Canada, Spain, Germany, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Romania, and Australia), they speak the Istro-Romanian language, the closest living relative of Romanian. On the other hand, the Aromanians and the Megleno-Romanians are Romance peoples who live south of the Danube, mainly in Greece, Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria although some of them migrated to Romania in the 20th century. It is believed that they diverged from the Romanians in the 7th to 9th century, and currently speak the Aromanian language and Megleno-Romanian language, both of which are Eastern Romance languages, like Romanian, and are sometimes considered by traditional Romanian linguists to be dialects of Romanian.

== Genetics ==

A Bulgarian study from 2013 shows genetic similarity between Thracians (8-6 century BC), medieval Bulgarians (8–10 century AD), and modern Bulgarians, highlighting highest resemblance between them and Romanians, Northern Italians and Northern Greeks. A genetic study published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; in 2019 examined the mtDNA of 25 Thracian remains in Bulgaria from the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. They were found to harbor a mixture of ancestry from Western Steppe Herders (WSHs) and Early European Farmers (EEFs), supporting the idea that Southeast Europe was the link between Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.

The prevailing Y-chromosome in Wallachia (Ploiești, Dolj), Moldavia (Piatra Neamț, Buhuși), Dobruja (Constanța), and northern Republic of Moldova is recorded to be Haplogroup I. Subclades I1 and I2 can be found in most present-day European populations, with peaks in some Northern European and Southeastern European countries. Haplogroup I occurs at 32% in Romanians. The frequency of I2a1 (I-P37) in the Balkans today is owed to indigenous European tribes, and was present before the Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe. A similar result was cited in a study investigating the genetic pool of people from Republic of Moldova, concluded about the representative samples taken for comparison from Romanians from the towns of Piatra-Neamț and Buhuși that &quot;the most common Y haplogroup in this population was I-M423 (40.7%). This is the highest frequency of the I-M423 haplogroup reported so far outside of the northwest Balkans. The next most frequent among Romanian males was haplogroup R-M17* (16.7%), followed by R-M405 (7.4%), E-v13 and R-M412* (both 5.6%).&quot; The I-M423 haplogroup is a subclade of I2a, a haplogroup prosperous in the Starcevo culture and its possible offshoot Cucuteni–Trypillia culture (4800-3000 BCE). The high concentration of I2a1b-L621, the main subclade, is attributed to Bronze Age and Early Iron Age migrations (Dacians, Thracians, Illyrians) and the medieval Slavic migrations.

According to a Y-chromosome analysis of 335 sampled Romanians, 15% of them belong to R1a. Haplogroup R1a, is a human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup which is distributed in a large region in Eurasia, extending from Scandinavia and Central Europe to southern Siberia and South Asia. Haplogroup R1a among Romanians is entirely from the Eastern European variety Z282 and may be a result of Baltic, Thracian or Slavic descent. 12% of the Romanians belong to Haplogroup R1b, the Alpino-Italic branch of R1b is at 2% a lower frequency recorded than other Balkan peoples. The eastern branches of R1b represent 7%, they prevail in parts of Eastern and Central Europe as a result of Ancient Greek colonisation – in parts of Sicily as well. Other studies analyzing the haplogroup frequency among Romanians came to similar results.

Delving into the regional differences of Mitochondrial DNA of Romanians, a 2014 study emphasised the different position of North and South Romanian populations (ie inside and outside of the Carpathian range) in terms of mitochondrial haplotype variability. The population within the Carpathian range was found to have haplogroup H at 59.7% frequency, U at 11.3%, K and HV at 3.23% each, and M, X and A at 1.61% each. The South Romanian population also showed the highest frequency in haplogroup H at 47% (lower than in the sample from the North of Romania), haplogroup U showed a noticeable frequency at 17% (higher than in the sample from North Romania), haplogroups HV and K at 10.61% and 7.58%, respectively, while haplogroups M, X and A were absent. Comparing the results to European and international samples, the study proposes a weak differentiated distribution of mitochondrial haplogroups between inner and outer Carpathian population (rather than North-South boundary) based on higher frequency for the haplogroup J and haplogroup K2a in the Southern Romanian sample - considered as markers of the Neolithic expansion in Europe from the Near East, the absence of K2a and the presence of haplogroup M in Northern Romanian sample - with higher frequency in Western and Southern Asia, and the inclusion of both Romanian populations within the range of the European mitochondrial variability, rather than being closer to the Near Eastern populations. The North Romanian sample was also found to be slightly separated from the other samples included in the study.

A 2017 paper concentrated on the Mitochondrial DNA of Romanians, showed how Romania has been &quot;a major crossroads between Asia and Europe&quot; and thus &quot;experienced continuous migration and invasion episodes&quot;; while stating that previous studies show Romanians &quot;exhibit genetic similarity with other Europeans&quot;. The paper also mentions how &quot;signals of Asian maternal lineages were observed in all Romanian historical provinces, indicating gene flow along the migration routes through East Asia and Europe, during different time periods, namely, the Upper Paleolithic period and/or, with a likely greater preponderance, the Middle Ages&quot;, at low frequency (2.24%). The study analysed 714 samples, representative to the 41 counties of Romania, and grouped them in 4 categories corresponding to historical Romanian provinces: Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, and Dobruja. The majority was classified within 9 Eurasian mitochondrial haplogroups (H, U, K, T, J, HV, V, W, and X), while also finding sequences that belonged to the most frequent Asian haplogroups (haplogroups A, C, D, I - at 2.24% overall frequency, and M and N) and African haplogroup L (two samples in Wallachia and one in Dobruja). The H, V, and X haplogroups were detected at higher frequencies in Transylvania, while the frequency of U and N was lower, with M being absent, interpreted as an indicator of genetic proximity of Transylvania to Central European populations, in contrast to the other three provinces, which showed resemblance to Balkan populations. The Dobrujan samples showed a larger contribution of genes from Southwestern Asia which the authors attributed to a larger Asian influence historically and/or its smaller sample size compared to that of the other populations included.

== Ethnogenesis ==
Three theories account for the ethnogenesis of the Romanian people. One, known as the Daco-Roman continuity theory, posits that they are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous peoples (Dacians) living in the Roman Province of Dacia, while the other posits that the Romanians are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous populations of the former Roman provinces of Illyricum, Moesia, Thracia, and Macedonia, and the ancestors of Romanians later migrated from these Roman provinces south of the Danube into the area which they inhabit today.
The third theory also known as the admigration theory, proposed by Dimitrie Onciul (1856–1923), posits that the formation of the Romanian people occurred in the former &quot;Dacia Traiana&quot; province, and in the central regions of the Balkan Peninsula. However, the Balkan Vlachs&#x27; northward migration ensured that these centers remained in close contact for centuries. This theory is a compromise between the immigrationist and the continuity theories.

==Demographics==
The largest ethnic group in Romania is ethnic Romanians, followed by Hungarians and Romani people.

<text>Alfonso Reyes Ochoa (17 May 1889 in Monterrey, Nuevo León – 27 December 1959 in Mexico City) was a Mexican writer, philosopher and diplomat. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times and has been acclaimed as one of the greatest authors in the Spanish language. He served as ambassador of Mexico to Argentina and Brazil.

== Biography ==

He was the ninth of the twelve children of General Bernardo Reyes Ogazón, Governor of the State of Nuevo León and the Secretary of War and Navy of President Porfirio Díaz (considered by some to be his natural successor), and his wife Aurelia Ochoa-Garibay y Sapién, member of a prominent family of Jalisco, direct descendants of Conquistador Diego de Ochoa-Garibay, as documented by Reyes in his &quot;Parentalia&quot;. 

Reyes was educated at various colleges in Monterrey, &quot;El Liceo Francés de México&quot;, &quot;El Colegio Civil de Monterrey&quot;, and later at the &quot;Escuela Nacional Preparatoria&quot; and graduated from the &quot;La Escuela Nacional de Jurisprudencia&quot;, which later became the law school at UNAM in 1913.

In 1909, he helped to found the Ateneo de la Juventud, along with other young intellectuals including Martín Luis Guzmán, José Vasconcelos, Julio Torri, and Pedro Enríquez Ureña, to promote new cultural and aesthetic ideals and educational reform in Mexico. In 1911, Reyes published his first book, &quot;Cuestiones estéticas&quot;. The following year, he wrote the short story &quot;La Cena&quot; (&quot;The Supper&quot;), which is considered a forerunner of surrealism and Latin American magical realism. In that year he was also named Secretary of the &quot;Escuela Nacional de Altos Estudios&quot; at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

Reyes obtained his law degree in 1913, the same year that his father died while he was participating in an coup d&#x27;état against the then President Francisco I. Madero.

Alfonso Reyes was posted to Mexico&#x27;s diplomatic service in France in 1913. After Germany invaded France in 1914, he moved to Madrid, Spain, and pursued a literary career as journalist, investigator, translator, critic, and writer. In 1915, he wrote what is probably his best-known essay, &quot;Visión de Anáhuac (1519)&quot; with its famous epigraph, &quot;Viajero: has llegado a la región más transparente del aire&quot;, the source of the title of Carlos Fuentes&#x27;s novel &quot;La región más transparente&quot;. &quot;Visión de Anáhuac&quot; is inspired by the “vitalist” philosophy of Henri Bergson and can be seen as a study on the metamorphosis in the process of creative evolution. 

Reyes was reinstated in the diplomatic service in 1920. He was the second secretary in Spain in 1920, was in Paris from 1924 to 1927, and then served as the ambassador to Argentina (1927–1930 and 1936–1937). He was the Mexican ambassador to Brazil from 1930 to 1935 and again in 1938. In 1939, he retired from the diplomatic corps and returned to Mexico, where he organized what is today El Colegio de México and dedicated himself to writing and teaching. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1950.

==Years in Spain==
His time in Spain, where he resided from 1914 to 1924, was considered his best creative period when he became a great writer and master of literature.

In Spain, where he experienced financial difficulties, he dedicated himself to literature and combined it with journalism. He worked at the Centro de Estudios Históricos (Historical Study Center) of Madrid under the direction of Ramón Menéndez Pidal. In 1919, he was named the Mexican 
Commission Secretary &quot;Francisco del Paso y Troncoso&quot;, the same year that &quot;Cantar de mio Cid&quot; was put into prose.

Many of his friends insisted that he was a natural in Spanish and should pursue a career in politics, but he declined to do so. One time he was presented with an offer to teach, but he rejected it. He was more interested in the aesthetics of Benedetto Croce. He published numerous essays about poetry of the Spanish Golden Age, such as Baroque y Góngora; on top of that he was one of the first writers to study poetry of Juana Inés de la Cruz. From 1917 he produced &quot;Cartones de Madrid&quot;, his small masterpiece, &quot;Visión de Anáhuac&quot;, &quot;El suicida&quot;, and in 1921, &quot;El cazador&quot;. He was a collaborator of &quot;Revista de Filología Española&quot;, &quot;Revista de Occidente&quot; and &quot;Revue Hispanique&quot;. His works about Spanish literature, older classical literature and aesthetics are notable, and among the more notable of that time, &quot;Cuestiones estéticas&quot; (1911). In Spain he organized a ceremony on 11 September 1923 at the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid (Real Botanical Garden of Madrid) to honor the memory of the symbolic poet Stéphane Mallarmé.

After 1924 he developed a diplomatic and social life in Paris, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro (he served as an ambassador of Mexico to Argentina and Brazil). He translated a Mallarmé and edited his own literary mail, &quot;Monterrey,&quot; publishing it in 1930. He wrote to friends abroad in every part of the world and gave talks, spoke at conferences and contributed to homages and cultural events.

He published among others, &quot;Cuestiones gongorinas&quot; (1927), &quot;Capítulos de literatura española&quot; (1939–195), &quot;Discurso por Virgilio&quot; (1931). His poetic works reveal a profound knowledge of the formal means, notably &quot;Ifigenia cruel&quot; (1924), &quot;Pausa&quot; (1926), &quot;5 casi sonetos&quot; (1931), &quot;Otra voz&quot; (1936) and &quot;Cantata en la tumba de Federico García Lorca&quot; (1937).

Reyes worked as a translator of works from Laurence Sterne, G. K. Chesterton, Anton Chekhov and as an editor of works by Juan Ruiz de Alarcón, Cantar del Mio Cid, Lope de Vega, Baltasar Gracián, Juan Ruiz, Francisco de Quevedo.

== Legacy ==
The Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges referred to Reyes as &quot;the greatest prose writer in the Spanish language of any age&quot;. At least five avenues in Monterrey&#x27;s metropolitan area, three in the municipality and one in Mexico City are named after Reyes.

There are many monuments built in honor of Alfonso Reyes in different Spanish speaking countries around the world.

On 17 May 2018, Google Doodle commemorated Alfonso Reyes&#x27; 129th birthday.

<text>Riddarholmen (, &quot;The Knights&#x27; Islet&quot;) is a small islet in central Stockholm, Sweden. The island forms part of Gamla Stan, the old town, and houses a number of private palaces dating back to the 17th century. The main landmark is the church Riddarholmskyrkan, used as Sweden&#x27;s royal burial church from the 17th century to 1950, and where a number of earlier Swedish monarchs also lie buried.

The western end of the island gives a magnificent panoramic and photogenic view of the bay Riddarfjärden, often used by TV journalists with Stockholm City Hall in the background. A statue of Birger Jarl, traditionally considered the founder of Stockholm, stands on a pillar in front of the Bonde Palace, north of Riddarholm Church.

Other notable buildings include the Old Parliament Building in the south-eastern corner, the Old National Archive on the eastern shore, and the Norstedt Building, the old printing house of the publisher Norstedts, the tower roof of which is a well-known silhouette on the city&#x27;s skyline.

== Palaces ==
While the Riddarholm Church dates back to the Middle Ages, and is one of Stockholm&#x27;s oldest buildings, most of the present structures on Riddarholmen were built during the 17th century when the island was an aristocratic setting that gave the islet its present name. Three of the palaces are gathered around the central public square, Birger Jarls Torg centred on the 19th-century statue of Birger Jarl: The Wrangel Palace on the west side, the most impressive, incorporates a medieval defensive tower and a portal designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder; the Stenbock and Hessenstein Palaces on the east side are less elaborate. North of the square, the two 19th-century wings of the Palace of Schering Rosenhane reach the rustic main building, which dates from the 17th century.

Wrangel Palace, and the palaces of Hessenstein, and Schering Rosenhane are today used by Svea Hovrätt, the appellate court for Svealand, while the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court reside in the palaces of Bonde and Stenbock respectively. Some of the older Swedish Government Agencies, like the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency and the Chancellor of Justice, are also located on the island.

According to a Swedish guide book, these anonymous institutions, together with the motorway Centralbron that isolates the island from the rest of the city, make the island as a whole a lifeless and dull environment, despite ambitious restorations during the 1990s.

== Origin of the name ==
The island is first mentioned as &quot;Kidaskär&quot;, literally &quot;Kid Skerry&quot;, indicating the islet was used to graze goats, in the Eric&#x27;s Chronicle (&quot;Erikskrönikan&quot;) from around 1325, which recounts how King Magnus Ladulås (1240–1290) had a Greyfriars monastery built on the island about 1270, asking in his will that he be buried in it in 1285. During the Middle Ages, the original name disappeared from historical records, replaced by &quot;Gråbrödraholm&quot; (&quot;Grey Brothers islet&quot;), &quot;Munckholmen&quot; (&quot;Monk Islet&quot;), and &quot;Gråmunkeholm&quot; (&quot;Grey Monks Islet&quot;), the latter most commonly used until the 17th century.

The monastery, however, closed following the Protestant Reformation and was subsequently converted into a church. Probably as consequence, the name changed in the 1630s, the island being referred to as &quot;Riddarholmen, för detta Gråmunkeholm kallad&quot; (&quot;Knight&#x27;s Islet, formerly called Grey Monk&#x27;s Islet&quot;) in 1638. The old name did persist however, so while Charles XI (1655–1697) preferred the new name, his youngest daughter Ulrika Eleonora (1688–1741) remained faithful to the old.

==Yacht/hotel==
*C. K. G. Billings&#x27;s yacht &quot;Vanadis&quot; is now anchored at Riddarholmen, and is used as a hotel known as Mälardrottningen with the ship rechristened as &quot;Lady Hutton&quot;.

<text>Melrose (, &quot;bald moor&quot;) is a town and civil parish in the Scottish Borders, historically in Roxburghshire. It lies within the Eildon committee area of Scottish Borders Council.
==History==
The original Melrose was &quot;Mailros&quot;, meaning &quot;the bare peninsula&quot; in Old Welsh or Brythonic. This referred to a neck of land by the River Tweed several miles east of the present town, where in the 6th century a monastery was founded associated with St Cuthbert. It was recorded by Bede, and also in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle with the name &quot;Magilros&quot;. This monastery and settlement, later known as &quot;Old Melrose&quot;, were long abandoned by the 12th century. Melrose is surrounded by the small villages of Darnick, Gattonside, Newstead, Lilliesleaf and Bowden.

King David I of Scotland took the throne in 1124, and sought to create a new Cistercian monastery on that site; however the monks preferred a site further west called &quot;Fordel&quot;. So the monastery now known as Melrose Abbey was founded there in 1136, and the town of Melrose grew up on its present site around it. In the late Middle Ages, its name was represented by a &quot;mell&quot; (a mason&#x27;s hammer) and a rose (for the Virgin Mary, to whom all Cistercian abbeys were dedicated). The Abbey fell into ruin after the Reformation but is still a striking structure. Several Scottish nobles are buried there, and a casket has been found which is believed to contain the heart of King Robert the Bruce. The casket has been re-buried in the Abbey. The Abbey ruins are cared for by Historic Scotland (open all year; entrance charge).

Nearby is the Roman fort of &quot;Trimontium&quot;, Abbotsford House the home of Sir Walter Scott, and Dryburgh Abbey where he was buried in 1832. The Corn Exchange, which was designed by David Cousin, was completed in 1863.

The war memorial, erected in 1920, was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.

==Sport==
Melrose is the birthplace of Rugby Sevens and also has a rugby union team, Melrose RFC. Every year on the second Saturday in April the famous Melrose Sevens are held at the Greenyards and is the biggest annual sporting event held in the town. Rugby union has always been the most popular sport in Melrose.

Melrose Golf Club is a nine-hole golf course situated on the edge of the town at the foot of the Eildon Hills.

Melrose Cricket Club is situated next to Borders General Hospital at Huntlyburn.

==Events==
Every June, the week-long Melrose Festival takes place. This involves appointing a Melrosian who has lived in the town for most of his life; and a queen and her court are appointed from the local primary school, Melrose Primary School (previously named Melrose Grammar School).

Melrose is now host to the annual Borders Book Festival which also takes place during June. The 2005 festival hosted guests including Michael Palin and Germaine Greer; Ian Rankin and Rory Bremner appeared in 2006.

Melrose hosts the annual Eildon Three Hill Race, attracting many runners, and the Melrose Pipe Band Championships, attracting pipers from all over the world.

Melrose is twinned with the town of Teba in southern Spain where Douglas Day is celebrated annually.

<doc id="322840" wikidata="Q3630526" url="?curid=322840" title="Automatic direction finder">
<text>An automatic direction finder (ADF) is a marine or aircraft radio-navigation instrument that automatically and continuously displays the relative bearing from the ship or aircraft to a suitable radio station. ADF receivers are normally tuned to aviation or marine NDBs (Non-Directional Beacon) operating in the LW band between 190 – 535 kHz. Like RDF (Radio Direction Finder) units, most ADF receivers can also receive medium wave (AM) broadcast stations, though these are less reliable for navigational purposes.

The operator tunes the ADF receiver to the correct frequency and verifies the identity of the beacon by listening to the Morse code signal transmitted by the NDB. On marine ADF receivers, the motorized ferrite-bar antenna atop the unit (or remotely mounted on the masthead) would rotate and lock when reaching the null of the desired station. A centerline on the antenna unit moving atop a compass rose indicated in degrees the bearing of the station. On aviation ADFs, the unit automatically moves a compass-like pointer (RMI) to show the direction of the beacon. The pilot may use this pointer to &quot;home&quot; directly towards the beacon, or may also use the magnetic compass and calculate the direction from the beacon (the &quot;radial&quot;) at which their aircraft is located.

Unlike the RDF, the ADF operates without direct intervention, and continuously displays the direction of the tuned beacon. Initially, all ADF receivers, both marine and aircraft versions, contained a rotating loop or ferrite loopstick aerial driven by a motor which was controlled by the receiver. Like the RDF, a sense antenna verified the correct direction from its 180-degree opposite.

More modern aviation ADFs contain a small array of fixed aerials and use electronic sensors to deduce the direction using the strength and phase of the signals from each aerial. The electronic sensors listen for the &quot;trough&quot; that occurs when the antenna is at right angles to the signal, and provide the heading to the station using a direction indicator. In flight, the ADF&#x27;s RMI or direction indicator will always point to the broadcast station regardless of aircraft heading. Dip error is introduced, however, when the aircraft is in a banked attitude, as the needle dips down in the direction of the turn. This is the result of the loop itself banking with the aircraft and therefore being at a different angle to the beacon. For ease of visualisation, it can be useful to consider a 90° banked turn, with the wings vertical. The bearing of the beacon as seen from the ADF aerial will now be unrelated to the direction of the aircraft to the beacon. 

Dip error is sometimes wrongly confused with quadrantal error, which is the result of radio waves being bounced and reradiated by the airframe. Quadrantal error does not affect signals from straight ahead or behind, nor on the wingtips. The further from these cardinal points and the closer to the quadrantal points (i.e. 45°, 135°, 225° and 315° from the nose) the greater the effect, but quadrantal error is normally much less than dip error, which is always present when the aircraft is banked.

ADF receivers can be used to determine current position, track inbound and outbound flight path, and intercept a desired bearing. These procedures are also used to execute holding patterns and non-precision instrument approaches.

==Typical service ranges of non-directional beacons (NDBs)==
Non-directional beacons in North America are classified by power output: &quot;low&quot; power rating is less than 50 watts; &quot;medium&quot; from 50 W to 2,000 W; and &quot;high&quot; at more than 2,000 W.

== ADF indicators ==
The ADF indicators are a kind of navigational display consisting of a dial and a needle that rotates around the dial and points to the beacon. This needle suggests the &quot;to&quot; bearing of the beacon, and to fly the &quot;from&quot; bearing, 180° needs to be added or subtracted from the reading.

There are two types of ADF indicators: the &quot;fixed azimuth dial&quot; type with 0° always represents the aircraft nose, and 180° always represents the aircraft tail; and the type with rotating dials that can be rotated to align the azimuth with the aircraft heading.

==Stages==
===Station passage===
As an aircraft nears an NDB station, the ADF becomes increasingly sensitive, small lateral deviations result in large deflections of the needle which sometimes shows erratic left/right oscillations. Ideally, as the aircraft overflies the beacon, the needle swings rapidly from directly ahead to directly behind. This indicates &quot;station passage&quot; and provides an accurate position fix for the navigator. Less accurate station passage, passing slightly to one side or another, is shown by slower (but still rapid) swinging of the needle. The time interval from the first indications of station proximity to positive station passage varies with altitude — a few moments at low levels to several minutes at high altitude.

===Homing===
The ADF may be used to &quot;home&quot; in on a station. Homing is flying the aircraft on the heading required to keep the needle pointing directly to the 0° (straight ahead) position. To home into a station, tune the station, identify the Morse code signal, then turn the aircraft to bring the ADF azimuth needle to the 0° position. Turn to keep the ADF heading indicator pointing directly ahead. Homing is regarded as poor piloting technique because the aircraft may be blown significantly or dangerously off-course by a cross-wind, and will have to fly further and for longer than the direct track.

===Tracking===
The ADF may also be used to &quot;track&quot; a desired course using an ADF and allowing for winds aloft, winds which may blow the aircraft off-course. Good pilotage technique has the pilot calculate a correction angle that exactly balances the expected crosswind. As the flight progresses, the pilot monitors the direction to or from the NDB using the ADF, adjusts the correction as required. A direct track will yield the shortest distance and time to the ADF location.

==Radio magnetic indicator (RMI)==
A radio magnetic indicator (RMI) is an alternate ADF display providing more information than a standard ADF. While the ADF shows relative angle of the transmitter with respect to the aircraft, an RMI display incorporates a compass card, actuated by the aircraft&#x27;s compass system, and permits the operator to read the magnetic bearing to or from the transmitting station, without resorting to arithmetic.

Most RMI&#x27;s incorporate two direction needles. Often one needle (the thicker, double-barred needle) is connected to an ADF and the other (generally thin or single-barred) is connected to a VOR. Some models allow the operator to select which needle is connected to each navigation radio. There is great variation between models, and the operator must take care that their selection displays information from the appropriate ADF and VOR.

This instrument display can replace a magnetic compass display in the instrument panel, but not necessarily the gyroscopic Heading Indicator. The Heading Indicator can be combined with information from navigation radios (primarily VOR/ILS) in a similar way, to create the Horizontal Situation Indicator. The HSI, along with the VOR system, has largely replaced use of the RMI, however the HSI&#x27;s much higher cost keeps the older combination of an RMI and an Omni Bearing Indicator attractive to cost-conscious pilots.

<text>Riddarholmen Church () is the church of the former medieval Greyfriars Monastery in Stockholm, Sweden. The church serves as the final resting place of most Swedish monarchs.

==Description==
Riddarholmen Church is located on the island of Riddarholmen, close to the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden. The congregation was dissolved in 1807 and today the church is used only for burial and commemorative purposes. Swedish monarchs from Gustavus Adolphus (d. 1632 AD) to Gustaf V (d. 1950) are entombed here (with only one exception: Queen Christina who is buried within St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome), as well as the earlier monarchs Magnus III (d. 1290) and Charles VIII (d. 1470). It has been discontinued as a royal burial site in favour of the Royal Cemetery and today is run by departments of the Swedish Government and Royal Court.
The Church&#x27;s age can be seen in its architecture, which is eclectic from various eras. Most of the church is a Northern European Gothic style, but parts of the church are also baroque.

It is one of the oldest buildings in Stockholm, parts of it dating to the late-13th century, when it was built as a greyfriars monastery. After the Protestant Reformation, the monastery was closed and the building became a Lutheran church. A spire designed by Flemish architect Willem Boy (1520–1592) was added during the reign of John III, but it was destroyed by a lightning strike on 28 July 1835, after which it was replaced with the present cast-iron spire.
Traditionally, the armorial plates depiciting the arms of deceased knights of the Royal Order of the Seraphim are affixed to the walls of the church. When a knight of the Order dies, his coat of arms is carried from the royal palace and rehung in the church, and when the funeral takes place the church&#x27;s bells are rung without pause from 12:00 to 13:00.

<text>James Gunn (March 13, 1753 – July 30, 1801) was a delegate to the Continental Congress and a United States Senator from Georgia.

==Early life==
Gunn was born in Virginia to John and Sarah Gunn and became a lawyer. Gunn served in the 1st Continental Dragoons during the Revolutionary War. He moved to Georgia after the war and became a significant political figure in his new home, establishing himself in short order as a planter, magistrate, state legislator, and militia officer, where he rose to brigadier general in the 1st Brigade of the Georgia militia in 1792. He owned slaves.

==Political life==

Between 1782 and 1789, Gunn unsuccessfully challenged retired Gen. Nathanael Greene to a duel, assailed Georgia Revolutionary War hero James Jackson in the press, and defeated Gen. Anthony Wayne for one of Georgia&#x27;s First U.S. Senate seats in January 1789. Gunn was selected as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1787 but never attended sessions.

In his first term as senator, between mid-May and late June 1789, Gunn moved from opposing the establishment of excise taxes to supporting them. He also opposed giving the president the power to remove heads of cabinet departments without the advice and consent of the Senate. The administration negotiated the Treaty of New York (1790) with the Creek Indians, which greatly angered many in Georgia. Gunn voted against the treaty. Like no other senator, Gunn impacted the internal processes in the Senate and the relationship between the executive and legislative branches of the newly formed government during his first term in office.

Gunn&#x27;s rivalry with James Jackson, which had originated in Georgia in the period between the end of the Revolution and the launching of the new federal government, heated up in the early 1790s. Gunn was a Federalist, and Jackson was a Jeffersonian. Gunn supported the formation of the Georgia Company and the sale of the Yazoo lands. In the aftermath of the Yazoo sale, Gunn acted quickly to complete the transaction and protect it in Washington, while Jackson tried to block the completion of the sale. On June 24, 1795, Gunn voted in favor of the Jay Treaty, one of only two southern senators to do so. James Jackson voted against it. Jackson resigned from the Senate and returned to Georgia to work against Gunn, who fell in public opinion due to the Yazoo land fraud.

Gunn was re-elected in 1795 and served out his second term until March 1801.

==Death and legacy==
Gunn died in Louisville, Georgia, and is buried in a Revolutionary War cemetery in Louisville. A World War II Liberty ship, the &quot;SS James Gunn, ATS-0044&quot; was built in 1942 and named for him.

<text>Eutrochium fistulosum (&quot;Eupatorium fistulosum&quot;), also called hollow [[Joe-Pye weed]], trumpetweed, or purple thoroughwort, is a perennial North American flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Canada and throughout the eastern and south central United States from Maine west to Ontario, Wisconsin, and Missouri and south as far as Florida and Texas. The specific name &quot;fistulosum&quot; refers to the tubular stem; see fistula.

&quot;Eutrochium fistulosum&quot; is a herbaceous perennial plant sometimes as much as tall. It is found in moist, rich soil alongside ditches and marshes, or in wet forests. It flowers from mid-summer to the first frosts, makes an attractive backdrop in garden plots, and is very attractive to butterflies, bees, and other nectar-feeding insects. In addition, it is a larval host to the Clymene moth, eupatorium borer moth, ruby tiger moth, and the three-lined flower moth.

The plant has one simple erect stem, which is green with purple dots or longitudinal dashes and can grow over six feet tall. The upper stems are reddish or purplish. Leaves and primary subdivisions of the flower head appear in whorls of 3–5 (rarely 2 or 6, the rotational symmetry of most plants is consistent). Leaves are large, long and sharply toothed. One plant can produce several flower heads in a branching array, each head with 4-7 pink or purple disc flowers but no ray flowers.

<doc id="322850" wikidata="Q1343885" url="?curid=322850" title="Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education">
<text>Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM; ), also known as Technological Institute of Monterrey () or just Tec, is a private research university based in Monterrey, Mexico, which has grown to include 35 campuses located across 25 cities in the country and 22 liaison offices in other 15 countries.

The university was founded in 1943 by Eugenio Garza Sada, an MIT-educated industrialist. As of 2019, it is the 15th university in the world with the highest number of billionaire alumni according to &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; and the only university in Latin America to appear in the ranking. ITESM is also known as being the first university to be connected to the Internet in Ibero-America and being one of the leaders in patent applications among Mexican universities.

==History==
===Early years===
The institute was founded on September 6, 1943, by a group of local businessmen led by Eugenio Garza Sada, a moneyed heir of a brewing conglomerate who was interested in creating an institution that could provide highly skilled personnel — both university graduates and technicians— to the booming Monterrey corporations of the 1940s. The group was structured into a non-profit organization called &quot;Enseñanza e Investigación Superior A.C. (EISAC)&quot; and recruited several academicians led by León Ávalos y Vez, an MIT alumnus and then director-general of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the National Polytechnic Institute, who designed its first academic programs and served as its first director-general.

In its early years the Institute operated at Abasolo 858 Oriente in a large, two-story house located a block and a half away from Zaragoza Square, behind the city&#x27;s Metropolitan Cathedral. As these facilities soon proved to be insufficient, it started renting out adjacent buildings and by 1945 it became apparent that a university campus was necessary. For that reason, a master plan was commissioned to Enrique de la Mora and on February 3, 1947, what would later be known as its Monterrey Campus was inaugurated by Mexican President Miguel Alemán Valdés.

Because the operations of the local companies were highly reliant on U.S. markets, investments, and technology; internationalization became one of its earliest priorities. In 1950 it became the first foreign university in history to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), one of the six regional accreditation agencies recognized by the United States Department of Education. Its foreign accreditation would end up being a decisive influence in its development, as it was forced to submit itself to external evaluation earlier than most Mexican universities (1967) and unlocked additional sources of revenue, such as tuition funds from foreign students interested in taking summer courses in Mexico for full-academic credit.

===Expansion===

Its growth outside the city of Monterrey began in the late-1960s, when both its rector and head of academics lobbied for expansion. A first attempt, funded a few years earlier by several businessmen from Mexicali, Baja California, was staffed and organized by the Institute but faced opposition from the Board of Trustees once the federal government refused any additional subsidy and members of the Board cast doubt on its ability to get funds as an out-of-state university. At the end the project was renamed &quot;Centro de Enseñanza Técnica y Superior (CETYS)&quot; and grew into a fully independent institution.

Aside from the CETYS experiment and the 150 hectares bought in 1951 for the agricultural program&#x27;s experimental facilities in nearby Apodaca, Nuevo León, no other expansion outside Monterrey was attempted until 1967, when a school of maritime studies was built in the port of Guaymas, Sonora. Shortly thereafter, premises were built in Obregón and courses began to be offered in Mexico City. Those premises and the ones that followed, then called external units, were fully dependent on the Monterrey Campus until 1984, when they were restructured as semi-independent campuses and reorganized in regional rectorates (&quot;see Organization&quot;).

In 1987, when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools demanded faculty members with master&#x27;s degrees to lecture 100% of its undergraduate courses, the Institute invested considerably in both distance learning and computer network technologies and training, effectively becoming, on February 1, 1989, the first university ever connected to the Internet in both Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world. Such efforts contributed to the creation of its former &quot;Virtual University&quot; a few years later and allowed it to become the first country-code top level domain registry in Mexico; first by itself from 1989 to 1995, and then as a major shareholder of &quot;NIC Mexico&quot;, the current national registry.

==Campuses==
There are thirty-one campuses of the Institute distributed in twenty-five Mexican cities. Each campus is relatively independent but shares a national academic curriculum (&quot;see Academics&quot;). The flagship campus is located in Monterrey, where the national, system-wide rectorate is located. Most of them deliver both high school and undergraduate education, some offer postgraduate programs and only eight (Cumbres, Eugenio Garza Sada, Eugenio Garza Lagüera, Santa Catarina, Metepec, Santa Anita, Esmeralda and Valle Alto) deliver high school courses exclusively. Nevertheless, curricular and extension courses and seminars are usually available at most facilities.

===Campuses by region===

Former campuses include Celaya (Prepa Tec, closed in 2020), Veracruz (closed in 2021), Guaymas (transferred to TecMilenio University in the early 2000s) and Mazatlán (transferred to TecMilenio University in 2009).

*North: Monterrey, PrepaTec Cumbres, PrepaTec Eugenio Garza Lagüera, PrepaTec Eugenio Garza Sada, Prepa Tec Santa Catarina, PrepaTec Valle Alto, Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Ciudad Juárez, Laguna, Saltillo, Tampico and Zacatecas.
*Centro: Mexico City, Santa Fe, State of Mexico, PrepaTec Esmeralda, Toluca 
*South: Chiapas, Cuernavaca, Hidalgo, PrepaTec Metepec, Puebla
*West: Colima, Guadalajara, Irapuato, León, Morelia, PrepaTec Navojoa, Northern Sonora, Obregón, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, PrepaTec Santa Anita and Sinaloa.


As of June 2019, campuses were divided into the following Mexican regions:

===Other infrastructure===
In addition to the campuses, the Institute manages:

*The Ignacio A. Santos Medical School, the &quot;Hospital San José&quot; and the Zambrano-Hellion Medical Center.
*Eight international sites in Argentina (Buenos Aires), Colombia (Bogotá, Medellín), Ecuador (Guayaquil and Quito), Panama (Panama City), Peru (Lima) and the United States (Miami) offering extension courses, research and international consulting.
*Fifteen liaison offices in charge of forging international partnerships and negotiating professional internships and academic exchanges with local universities, companies and civil institutions. Current liaison offices are located in Belgium (Brussels), Canada (Montreal and Vancouver), China (Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai), France (Nice and Paris), Italy (Florence, Macerata and Verona), Switzerland (Fribourg), Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston, Dallas and Washington, D.C.)

==Organization==

All campuses are sponsored by non-profit organizations composed primarily of local businesspeople. The Monterrey Campus is sponsored by &quot;Enseñanza e Investigación Superior, A.C. (EISAC)&quot;, which co-sponsored the system as a whole until a newly built organization, &quot;Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, A.C. (ITESM AC)&quot; overtook those responsibilities. Such organizations (effectively serving as boards of trustees) are responsible for electing the rectors or directors of a particular campus. Since February 2012, the president of ITESMAC is José Antonio Fernández, a class of 1976 alumnus and current chairman and CEO of FEMSA. Former presidents include the founder, Eugenio Garza Sada (1943–73) and his son, Eugenio Garza Lagüera (1973–97), and Lorenzo Zambrano (1997–2012), a class of 1966 alumnus and until his passing.

Former heads of the Institute include:

*León Ávalos y Vez (1943–1947) first director-general.
*Roberto Guajardo Suárez (1947–1951) second director-general.
*Víctor Bravo Ahuja (1951–1958) third director-general, and from April 11, 1955, first rector.
*Fernando García Roel (1959–1984) second rector.
*Rafael Rangel Sostmann (1985–2011) third rector.
*Salvador Alva (2011–2019) fourth rector and Executive President.
Since 2020, The Tecnológico de Monterrey Rector and Executive President is David Garza Salazar.

===High schools===

Following the historical trend of Mexico&#x27;s largest universities, the Institute sponsors several high schools which are united under the name &quot;HighPoint International School&quot;. This high schools share one or more national curricula: bicultural, multicultural and/or International Baccalaureate, which is administered from Geneva, Switzerland. The bicultural focuses on better understanding of the English language, the multicultural program requires studying a third language and to have an exchange program abroad. Finally, the IB is an academically challenging program where students can obtain the IB Diploma when they graduate. Additionally, students can receive college credits both at the TEC and universities abroad. Multicultural students are able to take IB courses if they wish with the focus on obtaining IB Subject Certificates. , over 26,000 students in several campuses were registered as high school students within the system.

==Academics==

Academically, the university is organized into several departments and divisions —as opposed to the traditional faculty school scheme used by most Mexican public universities— and it was the first Mexican university in history to divide the academic year in semesters. Current academic calendar for both high school and undergraduate students is composed of two semesters running from August to December and from January to May (each lasting 16 weeks) and an optional summer session from June to July, where at most two courses can be taken in an intensive basis.

, the institute offers 57 undergraduate degrees, of which 37 are taught in English and are generally awarded after nine semesters of study (except for Medicine and Architecture); 33 master&#x27;s degrees, generally lasting three to five semesters (and can also be structured in three-months terms), and 11 doctorate degrees varying in length according to their academic field.

===Admissions===

Since 1969 the Institute requires every college applicant to achieve a minimum pass mark at an academic aptitude test which is 900 out of 1600. (&quot;Prueba de Aptitud Académica, PAA&quot;) delivered by The College Board, a not-for-profit examination board in the United States. However, each campus is free to request additional requirements; such as a grade average of 80 or 90 in high school (on a 100-point scale) for those willing to transfer or apply to the Monterrey Campus. As for the graduate schools, the requirements may vary according to the discipline, such as a grade average of 80/100 and 550-points in both the GMAT and the TOEFL for some programs at its Graduate Business School (EGADE).

===Accreditations===
Studies at the institute are officially accredited by the Secretariat of Public Education of Mexico (&quot;Secretaría de Educación Pública, SEP&quot;) and by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) of the United States. In November 2008, its graduate business school (EGADE) became one of the 34 business schools in the world to hold simultaneous accreditation of its programs by the AACSB of the United States, the Association of MBAs of the United Kingdom and the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) while the Institute became the first Latin American university in history to receive full-accreditation on some of its engineering programs by ABET (as opposed to the traditional &quot;substantially-equivalent&quot; designation given to most schools outside the United States).

The quality of its programs is also audited by the Institute of Food Technologists, the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management and by the national accrediting councils of Mexico, such as the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (&quot;Consejo para la Acreditación de la Educación Superior, COPAES&quot;) and the Inter-Institutional Committees for Higher Education Evaluation (&quot;Comités Interinstitucionales de Evaluación de la Educación Superior, CIEES&quot;).

, 169 undergraduate degrees were accredited by national accrediting councils and 36 were accredited by international accrediting agencies. As for graduate degrees, 11 were accredited by international accrediting agencies and 58 were listed in the National Census of High-Quality Postgraduate Studies (&quot;Padrón Nacional de Posgrados de Calidad, PNPC&quot;) by the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT).

===Academic memberships===
The institute is the only Latin American institution at the European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU) —an organization committed to innovations in both teaching and learning— and at Universitas 21; an international network of research-intensive universities established as an &quot;international reference point and resource for strategic thinking on issues of global significance.&quot; It is also the only Mexican university, along the National Autonomous University of Mexico, to be enrolled at the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, an international consortium of leading research universities including Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and Caltech. The institute was also the first private university to become a member of the National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education of Mexico (ANUIES) back when it was composed entirely by public universities (1958) and is a full member of the Mexican Federation of Private Institutions of Higher Education (&quot;Federación de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educación Superior, FIMPES&quot;). The university recently became a partner of Washington University in St. Louis through the McDonnell International Scholars Academy.

===Faculty===
The institute has over 10,000 professors at high school, undergraduate and postgraduate levels: 2,207 tenured and 7,900 associated professors, and all of them have the appropriate academic credentials to lecture at their corresponding academic level according to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. some 470 professors taught courses, worked in international projects or attended seminars or congresses at foreign universities while some 590 foreign professors taught courses at the institute. As for their academic development, its faculty training program was bestowed with the 2004 Andrew Heiskell Award for Innovation in International Education by the Institute of International Education.

===Libraries===

The institute has at least thirty-three libraries in twenty-five Mexican cities holding over 2.4 million books, publications, and 46 types of electronic databases with at least 51,000 specialized magazines and academic journals and over 9000 e-books. Its Cervantean Library, named after Miguel de Cervantes and located in the current rectorate, holds one of the largest collections of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; incunabula, an original edition of &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopédie&quot;, and the Mario Pani Archives, and other bibliographical treasures while the main library of the Monterrey Campus holds the personal collections of archaeologist Ignacio Bernal.

===Rankings===


Overall, the institute is the only Mexican university besides the National Autonomous University of Mexico to be ranked at the 2010 QS World University Rankings, in which it was classified #65 worldwide at its Employer&#x27;s Review, #269 in Engineering and Information Technology, #232 in Social Sciences and #387 at its overall ranking. In the 2010 International Professional Ranking of World Universities, developed by the &quot;École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris&quot;, it ranked 224 out of 390 worldwide.

Among its graduate schools, EGADE has been ranked 7th among the best business schools outside the United States according to the Wall Street Journal (2006), 4th in the world in business ethics and social-responsibility programs according to BusinessWeek magazine (2005), among the 100 best graduate business schools in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit (2009) and its OneMBA program, delivered in partnership with four different institutions (see Joint programs and international partnerships below) was ranked 27 worldwide by the Financial Times in its 2009 Executive Master in Business Administration rankings.

===Joint programs and international partnerships===
Some of its academic programs are offered as joint degrees or in partnership with foreign universities:

==Medical school==
The Ignacio A. Santos School of Medicine (Escuela de Medicina Ignacio A. Santos, aka: EMIS) is the medical school division of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM). Established in 1978 in Monterrey, Mexico.

The School of Medicine was founded to satisfy the country&#x27;s need for high quality medical training and innovation in biomedical research. Currently, there are approximately 500 students enrolled in the M.D. program and about 105 postgraduate students. Aside from the medical doctor program, the School of Medicine also offers a joint M.D.-Ph.D. program with Houston Methodist Hospital, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center, and other Bachelors in Biosciences, Nutrition Sciences and Biomedical Engineering. The graduate medical education department offers several medical residency and fellowship programs. The general director of the TecSalud organization is Guillermo Torre M.D. PhD, a cardiologist who trained under Michael E. DeBakey MD at Baylor College of Medicine.

==Research==

Although some of the founding members of its faculty were prominent researchers (first rector León Ávalos y Vez had formed a National Commission on Science and served as director-general of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the National Polytechnic Institute) formal research activities at the institute did not start until 1951, when its Institute of Industrial Research was founded in close collaboration with the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, Texas —one of the oldest and largest independent, nonprofit, applied research and development organizations in the United States.

Notwithstanding some reputable achievements, throughout most of the 20th century its research activities —normally financed independently or under private sponsorship— were rather scarce in comparison to public universities such as the National Autonomous University of Mexico or the National Polytechnic Institute, whose budgets make up to 30% of the federal spending in higher education and, as such, are heavily financed by the government through the federal budget.

Despite its inherent difficulties to secure research funds in a developing country where private sponsorship barely accounts for 1.1% of the national spending on science, a new institutional mission in 2005 made social and scientific research in Mexico&#x27;s strategic areas one of its top priorities for the next decade. As a result, new corporate endowments and funds were committed, new research programs were created (including the first research program financed by Google in Latin America) and important labs and infrastructure have been built, such as the Femsa Biotechnology Center, the Water Center for Latin America and the Caribbean (financed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Femsa Foundation), the Motorola Research and Development Center on Home &amp; Networks Mobility, its Center for Advanced Design at the Guadalajara Campus and, in association with the Mainz Institute of Microtechnology of Germany (IMM), the first center of chemical micro process engineering in Latin America.

Additionally, the Institute developed a researcher-friendly patent scheme that aims to attract talented researchers and reduce the national brain drain. The scheme, in which the researcher may receive up to 30% of the patent licensing income, works in combination with its internal Rómulo Garza Prize and its national Luis Elizondo Prize and has allowed it to become the leading patent applicant among Mexican universities since 2006.

==Student life==

Student life, traditions and activities vary among campuses. Generally speaking, student involvement is encouraged by the local campus through an office of student affairs and the Department of Leadership and Student Formation (LiFE), which supervises most of the student groups, sports teams, regional associations and its student federation (FETEC).

The Institute goes to great lengths to provide scholarships to those in need, awarding partial financial assistance to 49% of its student population. However, with tuition fees exceeding per academic year (among the highest in Latin America according to Forbes magazine) most of its student community comes from upper and upper-middle class and the overall atmosphere is arguably politically and socially conservative. For example, opposite-sex visits are forbidden in dormitories unless it is in common areas and some high school staff in the Mexico City Campus has publicly admonished students for questioning conservative politicians during school visits (although no disciplinary action was ever taken).

The number of international students vary notably among campuses. , 4,714 foreign students were studying in one of its campuses while 10,618 Tech students were taking courses in a foreign university.

===Athletics===


Tec has a good record in college athletics, picking up over 18% of the medals at the 2007 national collegiate competition (&quot;Universiada&quot;) and one of its campuses won every American Football Collegiate Championship in Mexico (ONEFA) from 1998 to 2008. Such accomplishments were possible through the institute&#x27;s investments in sports facilities and personnel and a well-funded and comprehensive athletic scholarships program, which attracted a significant number of promising athletes but prompted allegations of talent drain by some of its rivals. Before the 2009 season the Institute decided to part ways with the organization and create a new league; however, the league didn&#x27;t materialize after other breakaway universities decided to remain in the ONEFA. The Institute asked to return to the organization, but the ONEFA Board decided that the request should be formally presented in its next ordinary meeting, after the 2009 season, which its four teams ended up playing between themselves in a Tech-only championship. For the 2010 season, the Institute decided not to participate in the ONEFA championship and, instead, asked the CONADEIP, a national athletic association of private educational institutions, to create an American football championship.

Although there are local adaptations, since 1945 the system-wide sports mascot is the ram (&quot;borrego salvaje&quot;), traditionally embodied in a male bighorn sheep. A somewhat popular urban legend states that the mascot was chosen by the American football team on its way to a match, after spotting a male sheep on the road. According to the official sources, however, the mascot was chosen during an official contest held by students in the mid-1940s.

==Notable people==

From December 2006 to January 2009 both the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the Mexican Secretary of Economy (former Kelloggs&#x27; CEO Carlos Gutiérrez and Gerardo Ruiz Mateos) were Tech alumni. Other businesspeople include Cemex&#x27; CEO Lorenzo Zambrano, FEMSA&#x27;s CEO José Antonio Fernández, Grupo Salinas&#x27; CEO Ricardo Salinas Pliego, film producer and activist Max Appedole, and Casa Cuervo&#x27;s CEO Juan Beckman.

<text>Georg Morris Cohen Brandes (4 February 1842 – 19 February 1927) was a Danish critic and scholar who greatly influenced Scandinavian and European literature from the 1870s through the turn of the 20th century. He is seen as the theorist behind the &quot;Modern Breakthrough&quot; of Scandinavian culture. At the age of 30, Brandes formulated the principles of a new realism and naturalism, condemning hyper-aesthetic writing and also fantasy in literature. His literary goals were shared by some other authors, among them the Norwegian &quot;realist&quot; playwright Henrik Ibsen.

When Georg Brandes held a series of lectures in 1871 with the title &quot;Main Currents in 19th-century Literature&quot;, he defined the Modern Breakthrough and started the movement that would become Cultural Radicalism. In 1884 Viggo Hørup, Georg Brandes, and his brother Edvard Brandes started the daily newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot; with the motto: &quot;The paper of greater enlightenment&quot;. The paper and their political debates led to a split of the liberal party Venstre in 1905 and created the new party Det Radikale Venstre.

==Biography==
Georg Brandes was born into a non-observant Jewish middle-class family in Copenhagen, the elder brother of prominent Danes Ernst Brandes and Edvard Brandes. He became a student at the University of Copenhagen in 1859 where he first studied jurisprudence. From this, however, his interests soon turned to philosophy and aesthetics. In 1862 he won the gold medal of the university for an essay on &quot;The Idea of Nemesis among the Ancients&quot;. Before this, indeed since 1858, he had shown a remarkable gift for verse-writing, the results of which, however, were not abundant enough to justify separate publication. Brandes did not collect his poems until as late as 1898. At the university, which he left in 1864, Brandes was influenced by the writings of Heiberg in criticism and Søren Kierkegaard in philosophy, influences which continued to leave traces on his work.
In 1866, he contributed to the discussion of the works of Rasmus Nielsen in &quot;Dualism in our Recent Philosophy&quot;. From 1865 to 1871 he traveled much in Europe, acquainting himself with the condition of literature in the principal centers of learning. His first important contribution to letters was his &quot;Aesthetic Studies&quot; (1868), where his maturer method is already foreshadowed in several brief monographs on Danish poets. In 1870 he published several important volumes, &quot;The French Aesthetics of the Present Day&quot;, dealing chiefly with Hippolyte Taine, &quot;Criticisms and Portraits&quot;, and a translation of &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot; by John Stuart Mill, whom he had met that year during a visit to England.

===The Modern Breakthrough===

Brandes now took his place as the leading northern European critic, applying to local conditions and habits of thought the methods of Taine. He became &quot;Docent&quot; or reader in Aesthetics at the University of Copenhagen, where his lectures were a great success and gathered huge audiences. His famous opening lecture on 3 November 1871, &quot;Hovedstrømninger i det 19de Aarhundredes Litteratur&quot; (), signalled the beginning of his lifelong struggle to modernize Danish literature. After the professorship of aesthetics became vacant in 1872, it was taken as a matter of course that Brandes would fill it. But the young critic had offended many sensibilities by his ardent advocacy of modern ideas; he was seen as a Jew (which he did not consider himself to be), his convictions were Radical, he was suspected of being an atheist. The authorities refused to appoint him, but his fitness for the post was so obvious that the chair of Aesthetics remained vacant for years, since no one else dared to place himself in comparison with Brandes.
In the middle of these polemics, Brandes began to issue volumes of the most ambitious of his works, &quot;Main Currents in the Literature of the Nineteenth Century&quot;, of which four volumes appeared between 1872 and 1875 (English translation, 1901–1905). The brilliant novelty of this criticism of the literature of major European countries at the beginning of the 19th century, and his description of the general revolt against the pseudo-classicism of the 18th century, at once attracted attention outside Denmark. The tumult which gathered round the person of the critic increased the success of the work, and the reputation of Brandes grew apace, especially in Germany and Russia.

In 1877 Brandes left Copenhagen and settled in Berlin, taking a considerable part in the aesthetic life of that city. His political views, however, made Prussia uncomfortable with him, and he returned in 1883 to Copenhagen, where he found a whole new school of writers and thinkers eager to receive him as their leader. He headed the group &quot;Det moderne Gjennembruds Mænd&quot; (&quot;The Men of the Modern Breakthrough&quot;), composed of J. P. Jacobsen, Holger Drachmann, Edvard Brandes, Erik Skram, Sophus Schandorph, and Norwegians Henrik Ibsen and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, but a conservative reaction against his &quot;realistic&quot; doctrines began around 1883, headed by Holger Drachmann.

===Later authorship===
Among his later writings must be mentioned the monographs on Søren Kierkegaard (1877), Esaias Tegnér (1878), Benjamin Disraeli (1878), Ferdinand Lassalle (in German, 1877), Ludvig Holberg (1884), Henrik Ibsen (1899) and on Anatole France (1905). Brandes wrote with great depth on the main contemporary poets and novelists of Denmark and Norway, and he and his disciples were for a long time the arbiters of literary success in the north. His &quot;Danish Poets&quot; (1877), containing studies of Carsten Hauch, Ludvig Bødtcher, Christian Winther and Frederick Paludan-Müller, his &quot;Men of the Modern Transition&quot; (1883), and his &quot;Essays&quot; (1889), are volumes essential to the proper study of modern Scandinavian literature. He wrote an excellent book on Poland (1888; English translation, 1903), and was one of the editors of the German version of Ibsen.

The most important of his later works was his study of William Shakespeare (1897–1898), which was translated into English by William Archer and was highly acclaimed. It was, perhaps, history&#x27;s most authoritative work on Shakespeare not principally intended for an English-speaking audience. He was afterwards engaged in writing a history of modern Scandinavian literature. In his critical work, which extended over a wider field than that of any other living writer, Brandes was aided by a singularly charming style, lucid and reasonable, enthusiastic but without extravagance, brilliant and colored without affectation. In 1900 he collected his works for the first time in a complete and popular edition and began to work on a German edition, completed in 1902.

He published &quot;Main Currents in Nineteenth-Century Literature&quot; in 1906 (six volumes). This book was among the 100 best books for education selected in 1929 by Will Durant. Durant and Brandes were both contributors to the &quot;Mother Earth&quot; magazine. In Volume 2 Brandes says about Kierkegaard, &quot;It is not merely in name that this irony bears a fundamental resemblance to Kierkegaard&#x27;s, which also aristocratically &#x27;chooses to be misunderstood&#x27;. The Ego of genius is the truth, if not in the sense in which Kierkegaard would have us understand his proposition, &#x27;Subjectivity is the truth&#x27;, still in the sense that the Ego has every externally valid commandment and prohibition in its power; and, to the astonishment and scandal of the world, invariably expresses itself in paradoxes. Irony is &#x27;divine audacity&#x27;. In audacity thus comprehended there are endless possibilities. It is freedom from prejudice, yet it suggests the possibility of the most audacious defence of all possible kinds of prejudices. It is more easily attainable, we are told, by woman than by man. &#x27;Like the feminine garb, the feminine intellect has this advantage over the masculine, that its possessor by a single daring movement can rise above all the prejudices of civilization and bourgeois conventionality, at once transporting herself into the state of innocence and the lap of Nature&#x27;. The lap of Nature! There is an echo of Rousseau&#x27;s voice even in this wanton tirade. We seem to hear the trumpet-call of revolution; what we really hear is only the proclamation of reaction. Rousseau desired to return to the state of nature, when men roamed naked through the pathless forests and lived upon acorns. Schelling wished to turn the course of evolution back to the primeval ages, to the days before man had fallen. Schlegel blows revolutionary melodies on the great romantic &#x27;wonder-horn&#x27;.&quot;

===Personal life and last years===

In the late 1880s, Brandes fought against what he saw as the hypocrisy of prudish sexuality, which caused a rift with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Between the years of 1886 and 1888 Brandes was engaged in a relationship with the Swedish author Victoria Benedictsson, who wrote &quot;Penningar&quot; and &quot;Fru Marianne&quot; under the male pseudonym Ernst Ahlgren. Benedictsson committed suicide in a Copenhagen hotel room, and the relationship with Brandes has later been blamed as the cause for her death.

In the late 1880s, Brandes turned to concentrating on &quot;great personalities&quot; as the source of culture. In this period, he discovered Friedrich Nietzsche, not only introducing him to Scandinavian culture but indirectly to the whole world. The series of lectures that he gave on Nietzsche&#x27;s thought, which he described as &quot;aristocratic radicalism&quot;, were the first to present Nietzsche as a world cultural figure in need of full intellectual notice. Of Brandes&#x27; description of his philosophy, Nietzsche himself remarked: &quot;The expression &#x27;aristocratic radicalism&#x27;, which you employ, is very good. It is, permit me to say, the cleverest thing that I have yet read about myself&quot;. In 1909 the lectures were edited and published as the monograph &quot;Friedrich Nietzsche&quot;, which included the complete Nietzsche/Brandes correspondence as well as two essays in homage to the late Nietzsche&#x27;s life and thought. Translated into English by A. G. Chater, the volume was published by Heinemann in 1914 and Nietzsche&#x27;s thought was thus able to reach a significant English language audience before World War I. It was Brandes who, in an 1888 letter, wrote to Nietzsche advising him to read the works of Søren Kierkegaard, with whom his thought had much in common. There is no evidence, however, that Nietzsche ever read any of Kierkegaard&#x27;s works.

The key idea of &quot;aristocratic radicalism&quot; went on to influence most of the later works of Brandes and resulted in voluminous biographies &quot;Wolfgang Goethe&quot; (1914–15), &quot;Francois de Voltaire&quot; (1916–17), &quot;Gaius Julius Cæsar&quot; 1918 and Michelangelo (1921).

In the 1900s, Brandes fought the Danish political establishment on several occasions, but eventually had to curb his acidic attacks. However, his international reputation was growing. In many ways he emulated his own assessment of Voltaire, as an author against habitual thinking, hypocrisy and the thin veneer of morality. He condemned the maltreatment of national minorities, the persecution of Alfred Dreyfus, etc. During World War I, he condemned the national aggression and imperialism on both sides and his last years were dedicated to anti-religious polemic. In this late period he made new connections to intellectuals like Henri Barbusse and Romain Rolland when he was co-signer in the foundation of Clarté, as well as E. D. Morel.

Brandes argued against the historicity of Jesus and was a proponent of the Christ myth theory. He published &quot;Sagnet om Jesus&quot; which was translated as &quot;Jesus: A Myth&quot; in 1926. He was an atheist.

==Legacy==
Brandes stands as one of the most influential inspirations of Danish culture, an equal of Holberg, Grundtvig and Ansgar. Among his supporters, Brandes&#x27; work was seen as a liberator from repressive norms, authority and hypocrisy, and he served as an inspiration for many contemporary writers. On the other hand, conservative circles condemned him as an immoral, unpatriotic and subversive blasphemer; as he became the lynchpin of criticism against modernity in its entirety. At the same time, some socialists criticized his elitist attitudes, while some feminists have regarded his attitude of sexual equality as being inconsequential.

His brother Edvard (1847–1931), also a well-known critic, was the author of a number of plays, and of two psychological novels: &quot;A Politician&quot; (1889), and &quot;Young Blood&quot; (1899). He became an outstanding political figure of the party Det Radikale Venstre.

<text>Giorgio Agamben ( ; ; born 22 April 1942) is an Italian philosopher best known for his work investigating the concepts of the state of exception, form-of-life (borrowed from Ludwig Wittgenstein) and &quot;homo sacer&quot;. The concept of biopolitics (carried forth from the work of Michel Foucault) informs many of his writings.

== Biography ==
Agamben was educated at the University of Rome, where in 1965 he wrote an unpublished laurea thesis on the political thought of Simone Weil. Agamben participated in Martin Heidegger&#x27;s Le Thor seminars (on Heraclitus and Hegel) in 1966 and 1968. In the 1970s, he worked primarily on linguistics, philology, poetics, and topics in medieval culture. During this period, Agamben began to elaborate his primary concerns, although their political bearings were not yet made explicit. In 1974–1975 he was a fellow at the Warburg Institute, University of London, due to the courtesy of Frances Yates, whom he met through Italo Calvino. During this fellowship, Agamben began to develop his second book, &quot;Stanzas&quot; (1977).

Agamben was close to the poets Giorgio Caproni and José Bergamín, and to the Italian novelist Elsa Morante, to whom he devoted the essays &quot;The Celebration of the Hidden Treasure&quot; (in &quot;The End of the Poem&quot;) and &quot;Parody&quot; (in &quot;Profanations&quot;). He has been a friend and collaborator to such eminent intellectuals as Pier Paolo Pasolini (in whose &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; he played the part of Philip), Italo Calvino (with whom he collaborated, for a short while, as advisor to the publishing house Einaudi and developed plans for a journal), Ingeborg Bachmann, Pierre Klossowski, Guy Debord, Jean-Luc Nancy, Jacques Derrida, Antonio Negri, Jean-François Lyotard and many, many others.

His strongest influences include Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin and Michel Foucault. Agamben edited Benjamin&#x27;s collected works in Italian translation until 1996, and called Benjamin&#x27;s thought &quot;the antidote that allowed me to survive Heidegger&quot;. In 1981, Agamben discovered several important lost manuscripts by Benjamin in the archives of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Benjamin had left these manuscripts to Georges Bataille when he fled Paris shortly before his death. The most relevant of these to Agamben&#x27;s own later work were Benjamin&#x27;s manuscripts for his theses &quot;On the Concept of History&quot;. Agamben has engaged since the nineties in a debate with the political writings of the German jurist Carl Schmitt, most extensively in the study &quot;State of Exception&quot; (2003). His recent writings also elaborate on the concepts of Michel Foucault, whom he calls &quot;a scholar from whom I have learned a great deal in recent years&quot;.

Agamben&#x27;s political thought was founded on his readings of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;, &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, and treatise &quot;On the Soul&quot;, as well as the exegetical traditions concerning these texts in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. In his later work, Agamben intervenes in the theoretical debates following the publication of Nancy&#x27;s essay &quot;La communauté désoeuvrée&quot; (1983), and Maurice Blanchot&#x27;s response, &quot;La communauté inavouable&quot; (1983). These texts analyzed the notion of community at a time when the European Community was under debate. Agamben proposed his own model of a community which would not presuppose categories of identity in &quot;The Coming Community&quot; (1990). At this time, Agamben also analyzed the ontological condition and &quot;political&quot; attitude of Bartleby (from Herman Melville&#x27;s short story) – a scrivener who &quot;prefers not&quot; to write.

Currently, Agamben is teaching at Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio (Università della Svizzera Italiana) and has taught at the Università IUAV di Venezia, the Collège international de Philosophie in Paris, and the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland; he previously taught at the University of Macerata and at the University of Verona, both in Italy. He also has held visiting appointments at several American universities, from the University of California, Berkeley, to Northwestern University, and at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf. Agamben received the Prix Européen de l&#x27;Essai Charles Veillon in 2006.

In 2013 he was awarded the Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize by the University of Tübingen for his work titled &quot;Leviathans Rätsel&quot; (Leviathan&#x27;s Riddle, translated into English by Paul Silas Peterson).

== Work ==
Much of Agamben&#x27;s work since the 1980s can be viewed as leading up to the so-called &quot;Homo Sacer&quot; project, which properly begins with the book &quot;Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life&quot;. In this series of works, Agamben responds to Hannah Arendt&#x27;s and Foucault&#x27;s studies of totalitarianism and biopolitics. Since 1995 he has been best known for this ongoing project, the volumes of which have been published out of order, and which include:
* &quot;Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life&quot; (1995)
* &quot;State of Exception&quot;. Homo Sacer II, 1 (2003)
* &quot;Stasis: Civil War as a Political Paradigm&quot;. Homo Sacer II, 2 (2015)
* &quot;The Sacrament of Language: An Archaeology of the Oath&quot;. Homo Sacer II, 3 (2008)
* &quot;The Kingdom and the Glory: For a Theological Genealogy of Economy and Government&quot;. Homo Sacer II, 4 (2007)
* &quot;Opus Dei: An Archeology of Duty&quot;. Homo Sacer II, 5 (2013)
* &quot;Remnants of Auschwitz: The Witness and the Archive&quot;. Homo Sacer III (1998).
* &quot;The Highest Poverty: Monastic Rules and Forms-of-Life&quot;. Homo Sacer IV, 1 (2013)
* &quot;The Use of Bodies&quot;. Homo Sacer IV, 2 (2016)

In 2017, these works were collected and published as &quot;The Omnibus Homo Sacer&quot;.

In the final volume of the series, Agamben intends to address &quot;the concepts of forms-of-life and lifestyles.&quot; &quot;What I call a form-of-life,&quot; he explains, &quot;is a life which can never be separated from its form, a life in which it is never possible to separate something like bare life. […] [H]ere too the concept of privacy comes in to play.&quot;

The reduction of life to &#x27;biopolitics&#x27; is one of the main threads in Agamben&#x27;s work, in his critical conception of a &quot;homo sacer&quot;, reduced to &#x27;bare life&#x27;, and thus deprived of any rights. Agamben&#x27;s concept of the &quot;homo sacer&quot; rests on a crucial distinction in Greek between &quot;bare life&quot; (&quot;la vita nuda&quot; or zoê ; Gk. ζωή &quot;zoê&quot;) and &quot;a particular mode of life&quot; or &quot;qualified life&quot; (bios , ; Gk. βίος &quot;bios&quot;). In Part III, section 7 of &quot;Homo Sacer&quot;, &quot;The Camp as the &#x27;Nomos&#x27; of the Modern&quot;, he evokes the concentration camps of World War II. &quot;The camp is the space that is opened when the state of exception begins to become the rule.&quot; Agamben says that &quot;What happened in the camps so exceeds (is outside of) the juridical concept of crime that the specific juridico-political structure in which those events took place is often simply omitted from consideration.&quot; The conditions in the camps were &quot;&quot;conditio inhumana&quot;,&quot; and the incarcerated somehow defined outside the boundaries of humanity, under the exception laws of &quot;Schutzhaft&quot;. Where law is based on vague, unspecific concepts such as &quot;race&quot; or &quot;good morals,&quot; law and the personal subjectivity of the judicial agent are no longer distinct.

In the process of creating a state of exception these effects can compound. In a realized state of exception, one who has been accused of committing a crime, within the legal system, loses the ability to use his/her voice and represent themselves. The individual can not only be deprived of their citizenship, but also of any form of agency over their own life. &quot;Agamben identifies the state of exception with the power of decision over life.&quot;

Within the state of exception, the distinction between &quot;bios&quot; (the life of the citizen) and &quot;zoê&quot; (the life of &quot;homo sacer&quot;) is made by those with judicial power. For example, Agamben would argue that Guantánamo Bay exemplifies the concept of &#x27;the state of exception&#x27; in the United States following 9/11. 

Agamben mentions that basic universal human rights of Taliban individuals while captured in Afghanistan and sent to Guantánamo Bay in 2001 were negated by US laws. In reaction to the removal of their basic human rights, detainees of Guantánamo Bay prison went on hunger strikes. Within a state of exception, when a detainee is placed outside the law he or she is, according to Agamben, reduced to &quot;bare life&quot; in the eyes of the judicial powers. Here, one can see why such measures as hunger strikes can occur in such places as prisons. Within the framework of a system that has deprived the individual of power, and their individual basic human freedoms, the hunger strike can be seen as a weapon or form of resistance. &quot;The body is a model which can stand for any bounded system. Its boundaries can represent any boundaries which are threatened or precarious.&quot; Within a state of exception the boundaries of power are precarious and threaten to destabilize not only the law, but one&#x27;s humanity, as well as their choice of life or death. Forms of resistance to the extended use of power within the state of exception, as suggested in Guantánamo Bay prison, also operate outside the law. In the case of the hunger strike, the prisoners were threatened and endured force feeding not allowing them to die. During the hunger strikes at Guantánamo Bay prison, accusations and founded claims of forced feedings began to surface in the autumn of 2005. In February 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that prisoners were being force fed in Guantánamo Bay prison and in March 2006, more than 250 medical experts, as reported by the BBC, voiced their opinions of the forced feedings stating that this was a breach of the government&#x27;s power and was against the rights of the prisoners.

===&quot;The Coming Community&quot; (1993)===
In &quot;The Coming Community&quot;, published in 1990 and translated by longtime admirer Michael Hardt in 1993, Agamben describes the social and political manifestation of his philosophical thought. Employing diverse short essays he describes the nature of &quot;whatever singularity&quot; as that which has an &quot;inessential commonality, a solidarity that in no way concerns an essence&quot;. It is important to note his understanding of &quot;whatever&quot; not as being indifference but based on the Latin &quot;quodlibet ens&quot; translated as &quot;being such that it always matters&quot;.

Agamben starts off by describing the &quot;lovable&quot;:

Similarly, Agamben discusses &quot;ease&quot; as the “place” of love, or more precisely, love as the encounter with a unique moment (“love as the experience of taking-place in a whatever singularity&quot;), which resonates with his utilization of the concept of &quot;use&quot; in his later writings.

Following the same trend, he employs, among others, the following to describe the &quot;watershed of whatever&quot;:

*Example – particular and universal
*Limbo – blessed and damned
*Homonym – concept and idea
*Halo – potentiality and actuality
*Face – common and proper, genus and individual
*Threshold – inside and outside
*Coming community – state and non-state (humanity)

Other themes addressed in &quot;The Coming Community&quot; include the commodification of the body, evil, and the messianic.

Unlike other continental philosophers he does not reject the dichotomies of subject/object and potentiality/actuality outright, but rather turns them inside-out, pointing out the zone where they become indistinguishable.

The political task of humanity, he argues, is to expose the innate potential in this zone of indistinguishability. And although criticised as dreaming the impossible by certain authors, he nonetheless shows a concrete example of &quot;whatever singularity&quot; acting politically:

=== &quot;Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life&quot; (1998) ===
In his main work &quot;Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life&quot; (1998), Agamben analyzes an obscure figure of Roman law that poses fundamental questions about the nature of law and power in general. Under the laws of the Roman Empire, a man who committed a certain kind of crime was banned from society and all of his rights as a citizen were revoked. He thus became a &quot;homo sacer&quot; (sacred man). In consequence, he could be killed by anybody, while his life on the other hand was deemed &quot;sacred&quot;, so he could not be sacrificed in a ritual ceremony.

Although Roman law no longer applied to someone deemed a &quot;Homo sacer&quot;, they remained &quot;under the spell&quot; of law. This means that &quot;human life&quot; is &quot;included in the juridical order solely in the form of its exclusion (that is, of its capacity to be killed)&quot;. &quot;Homo sacer&quot; was therefore both &quot;excluded&quot; from law &quot;and&quot; &quot;included&quot; at the same time. This paradoxical figure of &quot;homo sacer&quot; is the exact mirror image of the sovereign (&quot;basileus&quot;) – a king, emperor, or president – who stands, on the one hand, &quot;within&quot; law (so he can be condemned, e.g., for treason, as a natural person) and &quot;outside&quot; the law (since as a body politic he has power to suspend law for an indefinite time).

Agamben draws on Carl Schmitt&#x27;s definition of the Sovereign as the one who has the power to decide the &quot;state of exception&quot; (or &quot;justitium&quot;), where law is indefinitely &quot;suspended&quot; without being abrogated. 

Agamben argues that laws have always assumed the authority to define &quot;bare life&quot; – &quot;zoe&quot;, as opposed to &quot;bios&quot;, or &#x27;qualified life&#x27; – by making this exclusive operation, while at the same time gaining power over it by making it the subject of political control. The power of law to actively separate &quot;political&quot; beings (citizens) from &quot;bare life&quot; (bodies) has carried on from Antiquity to Modernity – literally from Aristotle to Auschwitz. Aristotle, as Agamben notes, constitutes political life via a simultaneous inclusion and exclusion of &quot;bare life&quot;: as Aristotle says, man is an animal born to life (Gk. ζῆν, &quot;zen&quot;), but existing with regard to the good life (εὖ ζῆν, &quot;eu zen&quot;) which can be achieved through politics. Bare life, in this ancient conception of politics, is that which must be transformed, via the State, into the &quot;good life&quot;; that is, bare life is that which is supposedly excluded from the higher aims of the state, yet is included precisely so that it may be transformed into this &quot;good life&quot;. Sovereignty, then, is conceived from ancient times as the power which determines what or who is to be incorporated into the political body (in accord with its &quot;bios&quot;) by means of the more originary exclusion (or exception) of what is to remain outside the political body—which is at the same time the source of that body&#x27;s composition (&quot;zoe&quot;). According to Agamben, biopower, which takes the bare lives of the citizens into its political calculations, may be more marked in the modern state, but has essentially existed since the beginnings of sovereignty in the West, since this structure of &quot;ex-ception&quot; is essential to the core concept of sovereignty.

=== &quot;State of Exception&quot; (2005) ===
In this book, Agamben traces the concept of &#x27;state of exception&#x27; (&quot;Ausnahmezustand&quot;) used by Carl Schmitt to Roman &quot;justitium&quot; and &quot;auctoritas&quot;. This leads him to a response to Carl Schmitt&#x27;s definition of sovereignty as the power to proclaim the exception.

Agamben&#x27;s text &quot;State of Exception&quot; investigates the increase of power by governments which they employ in supposed times of crisis. Within a state of emergency, Agamben refers to the states of exception, where constitutional rights can be diminished, superseded and rejected in the process of claiming this extension of power by a government.

The state of exception invests one person or government with the power and voice of authority over others extended well beyond where the law has existed in the past. &quot;In every case, the state of exception marks a threshold at which logic and praxis blur with each other and a pure violence without &quot;logos&quot; claims to realize an enunciation without any real reference&quot; (Agamben, pg 40). Agamben refers a continued state of exception to the Nazi state of Germany under Hitler&#x27;s rule. &quot;The entire Third Reich can be considered a state of exception that lasted twelve years. In this sense, modern totalitarianism can be defined as the establishment, by means of the state of exception, of a legal civil war that allows for the physical elimination not only of political adversaries but of entire categories of citizens who for some reason cannot be integrated into the political system&quot; (Agamben, p. 2).

The political power over others acquired through the state of exception, places one government—or one form or branch of government—as all powerful, operating outside the laws. During such times of extension of power, certain forms of knowledge shall be privileged and accepted as true and certain voices shall be heard as valued, while of course, many others are not. This oppressive distinction holds great importance in relation to the production of knowledge. The process of both acquiring knowledge, and suppressing certain knowledge, is a violent act within a time of crisis.

Agamben&#x27;s &quot;State of Exception&quot; investigates how the suspension of laws within a state of emergency or crisis can become a prolonged state of being. More specifically, Agamben addresses how this prolonged state of exception operates to deprive individuals of their citizenship. When speaking about the military order issued by President George W. Bush on 13 November 2001, Agamben writes, &quot;What is new about President Bush&#x27;s order is that it radically erases any legal status of the individual, thus producing a legally unnameable and unclassifiable being. Not only do the Taliban captured in Afghanistan not enjoy the status of POW&#x27;s (prisoner of war) as defined by the Geneva Convention, they do not even have the status of people charged with a crime according to American laws&quot; (Agamben, pg 3). 780 Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan were held at Guantánamo Bay without trial. These individuals were termed &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; Until 7 July 2006, these individuals had been treated outside the Geneva Conventions by the United States administration.

==== &quot;Auctoritas&quot;, &quot;charisma&quot; and &quot;Führertum&quot; doctrine ====
Agamben shows that &quot;auctoritas&quot; and &quot;potestas&quot; are clearly distinct – although they form together a system&quot;. He quotes Mommsen, who explains that &quot;auctoritas&quot; is &quot;less than an order and more than an advice&quot;.

While &quot;potestas&quot; derives from social function, &quot;auctoritas&quot; &quot;immediately derives from the &quot;patres&quot; personal condition&quot;. As such, it is akin to Max Weber&#x27;s concept of charisma. This is why the tradition ordered, at the king&#x27;s death, the creation of the sovereign&#x27;s wax-double in the &quot;funus imaginarium&quot;, as Ernst Kantorowicz demonstrated in &quot;The King&#x27;s Two Bodies&quot; (1957). Hence, it is necessary to distinguish two bodies of the sovereign in order to assure the continuity of &quot;dignitas&quot; (term used by Kantorowicz, here a synonym of &quot;auctoritas&quot;). Moreover, in the person detaining &quot;auctoritas&quot;—the sovereign—public life and private life have become inseparable. Augustus, the first Roman emperor who claimed &quot;auctoritas&quot; as the basis of &quot;princeps&quot; status in a famous passage of &quot;Res Gestae&quot;, had opened up his house to public eyes. In his theorization of thanatopolitics (the politics of death), Agamben uses the English and Roman examples to show how the sovereign justifies authority by his claimed ability to control or manage his own death. Agamben writes that the rituals of two deaths by the sovereign (as an ordinary human and then as effigy) demonstrate that death rituals show the people that the sovereign is in control of both lives.

The concept of &quot;auctoritas&quot; played a key-role in fascism and Nazism, in particular concerning Carl Schmitt&#x27;s theories, argues Agamben:

Thus, Agamben opposes Foucault&#x27;s concept of &quot;biopolitics&quot; to right (law), as he defines the state of exception, in &quot;Homo sacer&quot;, as the inclusion of life by right under the figure of &quot;ex-ception&quot;, which is simultaneously inclusion and exclusion. Following Walter Benjamin&#x27;s lead, he explains that our task would be to radically differentiate &quot;pure violence&quot; from right, instead of tying them together, as did Carl Schmitt.

Agamben concludes his chapter on &quot;&quot;Auctoritas&quot; and &quot;potestas&quot;&quot; writing:

Agamben&#x27;s thoughts on the state of emergency leads him to declare that the difference between dictatorship and democracy is thin indeed,or even ontologically non-existent, as rule by decree became more and more common, starting from World War I and the reorganization of constitutional balance. Agamben often reminds that Hitler never &quot;d&quot; the Weimar Constitution: he &quot;suspended&quot; it for the duration of the Third Reich with the Reichstag Fire Decree, issued on 28 February 1933. Indefinite suspension of law is what characterizes the state of exception.

===&quot;The Highest Poverty&quot; (2011)===

The English edition was translated by Adam Kotsko. In this study of medieval monastic rules, Agamben offers a genealogical approach to several concepts that Ludwig Wittgenstein established in his late philosophy, primarily the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;: rule-following, form-of-life, and the central importance of &#x27;use&#x27; (for Wittgenstein: &#x27;the meaning of a word is its use in language&#x27;, and he uses &#x27;language&#x27; not just to speak of word-language but any understandable behaviour). Agamben traces earlier versions of the term &#x27;form-of-life&#x27; throughout the development of monastic life, beginning with the establishment of a genre of written rules in the fourth century. The aim of the book is to differentiate between &#x27;law&#x27; and a particular use of rule that is opposite to the implementation of law. In order to sketch out the potential of this concept, we would need &#x27;a theory of use – of which Western philosophy lacks even the most elementary principles&#x27;. Agamben turns to the Franciscans to survey a unique historical incident of a group organising itself with a rule that &quot;is&quot; their life, and thinking of their own lives not as their own possession but as a communal &#x27;use&#x27;; he examines the ways in which this idea developed and how it eventually lapsed into the law of the Catholic Church.
According to reviewer Nathan Schneider, &quot;&quot;The Highest Poverty&quot; examines two medieval Christian attempts, in the name of eternal life, to live this life beyond the reach of ordinary politics: several centuries of monasticism, and then the brief and momentous epiphany in the movement founded by Francis of Assisi. Each, according to Agamben, fails in revealing ways.&quot;

=== Personal views ===

==== Criticism of US response to 9/11 ====
Giorgio Agamben is particularly critical of the United States&#x27; response to 11 September 2001, and its instrumentalization as a permanent condition that legitimizes a &quot;state of exception&quot; as the dominant paradigm for governing in contemporary politics. He warns against a &quot;generalization of the state of exception&quot; through laws like the USA PATRIOT Act, which means a permanent installation of martial law and emergency powers. In January 2004, he refused to give a lecture in the United States because under the US-VISIT he would have been required to give up his biometric information, which he believed stripped him to a state of &quot;bare life&quot; (&quot;zoe&quot;) and was akin to the tattooing that the Nazis did during World War II.

However, Agamben&#x27;s criticisms target a broader scope than the US &quot;war on terror&quot;. As he argues in &quot;State of Exception&quot; (2005), rule by decree has become common since World War I in all modern states, and has been since then generalized and abused. Agamben points out a general tendency of modernity, recalling for example that when Francis Galton and Alphonse Bertillon invented &quot;judicial photography&quot; for &quot;anthropometric identification&quot;, the procedure was reserved to criminals; to the contrary, today&#x27;s society is tending toward a generalization of this procedure to all citizens, placing the population under permanent suspicion and surveillance: &quot;The political body thus has become a criminal body&quot;. And Agamben notes that the Jews deportation in France and other occupied countries was made possible by the photos taken from identity cards. Furthermore, Agamben&#x27;s political criticisms open up in a larger philosophical critique of the concept of sovereignty itself, which he argues is intrinsically related to the state of exception.

==== Statements on COVID-19 ====
Agamben, in an article published by &quot;Il Manifesto&quot; on 26 February 2020, quoted the NRC in saying that there was no COVID-19 pandemic: &quot;In order to make sense of the frantic, irrational, and absolutely unwarranted emergency measures adopted for a supposed epidemic of coronavirus, we must begin from the declaration of the Italian National Research Council (NRC), according to which &#x27;there is no SARS-CoV2 epidemic in Italy.&#x27; and &#x27;the infection, according to the epidemiological data available as of today and based on tens of thousands of cases, causes light/moderate symptoms (a variant of flu) in 80–90% of cases. In 10–15%, there is a chance of pneumonia, but which also has a benign outcome in the large majority of cases. We estimate that only 4% of patients require intensive therapy. Agamben argued that “the health emergency was being exaggerated” to create a state of exception. Agamben&#x27;s views were strongly criticised by Sergio Benvenuto, Roberto Esposito, Divya Dwivedi, Shaj Mohan, Jean-Luc Nancy, Benjamin H. Bratton, and others.

<doc id="322855" wikidata="Q2992167" url="?curid=322855" title="Crystallin">
<text>In anatomy, a crystallin is a water-soluble structural protein found in the lens and the cornea of the eye accounting for the transparency of the structure. It has also been identified in other places such as the heart, and in aggressive breast cancer tumors.
The physical origins of eye lens transparency and its relationship to cataract are an active area of research. Since it has been shown that lens injury may promote nerve regeneration,
crystallin has been an area of neural research. So far, it has been demonstrated that crystallin β b2 (crybb2) may be a neurite-promoting factor.

==Function==

The main function of crystallins at least in the lens of the eye is probably to increase the refractive index while not obstructing light. However, this is not their only function. It has become clear that crystallins may have several metabolic and regulatory functions, both within the lens and in other parts of the body. More proteins containing βγ-crystallin domains have now been characterized as calcium binding proteins with Greek key motif as a novel calcium-binding motif.

== Enzyme activity ==

Some crystallins are active enzymes, while others lack activity but show homology to other enzymes. The crystallins of different groups of organisms are related to a large number of different proteins, with those from birds and reptiles related to lactate dehydrogenase and argininosuccinate lyase, those of mammals to alcohol dehydrogenase and , and those of cephalopods to glutathione S-transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Whether these crystallins are products of a fortuitous accident of evolution, in that these particular enzymes happened to be transparent and highly soluble, or whether these diverse enzymatic activities are part of the protective machinery of the lens, is an active research topic. The recruitment of protein that originally evolved with one function to serve a second, unrelated function is an example of an exaptation.

==Classification==
Crystallins from a vertebrate eye lens are classified into three main types: alpha, beta and gamma crystallins. These distinctions are based on the order in which they elute from a gel filtration chromatography column. These are also called ubiquitous crystallins. Beta- and gamma-crystallins (such as CRYGC) are similar in sequence, structure and domains topology, and thus have been grouped together as a protein superfamily called βγ-Crystallins. The α-crystallin family and βγ-crystallins compose the major family of proteins present in the crystalline lens. They occur in all vertebrate classes (though gamma-crystallins are low or absent in avian lenses); and delta-crystallin is found exclusively in reptiles and birds.

In addition to these crystallins there are other taxon-specific crystallins which are only found in the lens of some organisms; these include delta, epsilon, tau, and iota-crystallins. For example, alpha, beta, and delta crystallins are found in avian and reptilian lenses, and the alpha, beta, and gamma families are found in the lenses of all other vertebrates.

===Alpha-crystallin===
Alpha-crystallin occurs as large aggregates, comprising two types of related subunits (A and B) that are highly similar to the small (15-30kDa) heat shock proteins (sHsps), particularly in their C-terminal halves. The relationship between these families is one of classic gene duplication and divergence, from the small HSP family, allowing adaptation to novel functions. Divergence probably occurred prior to evolution of the eye lens, alpha-crystallin being found in small amounts in tissues outside the lens.

Alpha-crystallin has chaperone-like properties including the ability to prevent the precipitation of denatured proteins and to increase cellular tolerance to stress. It has been suggested that these functions are important for the maintenance of lens transparency and the prevention of cataracts. This is supported by the observation that alpha-crystallin mutations show an association with cataract formation.

The N-terminal domain of alpha-crystallin is not necessary for dimerisation or chaperone activity, but appears to be required for the formation of higher order aggregates.

===Beta and gamma crystallin===
Beta- and gamma- crystallin form a separate family. Structurally, beta and gamma crystallins are composed of two similar domains which, in turn, are each composed of two similar motifs with the two domains connected by a short connecting peptide. Each motif, which is about forty amino acid residues long, is folded in a distinctive Greek key pattern. However, beta crystallin is an oligomer, composed of a complex group of molecules, whereas gamma crystallin is a simpler monomer.

<doc id="322859" wikidata="Q1486141" url="?curid=322859" title="GNS theory">
<text>GNS theory is an informal field of study developed by Ron Edwards which attempts to create a unified theory of how role-playing games work. Focused on player behavior, in GNS theory participants in role-playing games organize their interactions around three categories of engagement: Gamism, Narrativism and Simulation.

The theory focuses on player interaction rather than statistics, encompassing game design beyond role-playing games. Analysis centers on how player behavior fits the above parameters of engagement and how these preferences shape the content and direction of a game. GNS theory is used by game designers to dissect the elements which attract players to certain types of games.

==History==
GNS theory was inspired by the threefold model idea, from discussions on the rec.games.frp.advocacy group on Usenet in summer 1997. The Threefold Model defined drama, simulation and game as three paradigms of role-playing. The name &quot;Threefold Model&quot; was coined in a 1997 post by Mary Kuhner outlining the theory. Kuhner posited the main ideas for theory on Usenet, and John H. Kim later organized the discussion and helped it grow.

In his article &quot;System Does Matter&quot;, which was first posted to the website Gaming Outpost in July 1999, Ron Edwards wrote that all RPG players have one of three mutually-exclusive perspectives. According to Edwards, enjoyable RPGs focus on one perspective and a common error in RPG design is to try to include all three types. His article could be seen as a warning against generic role-playing game systems from large developers. Edwards connected GNS theory to game design, which helped to popularize the theory. On December 2, 2005, Edwards closed the forums on the Forge about GNS theory, saying that they had outlived their usefulness.

== Aspects ==
=== Gamism ===
A gamist makes decisions to satisfy predefined goals in the face of adversity: to win. Edwards wrote,
These decisions are most common in games pitting characters against successively-tougher challenges and opponents, and may not consider why the characters are facing them in the first place. Gamist RPG design emphasizes parity; all player characters should be equally strong and capable of dealing with adversity.

Combat and diversified options for short-term problem solving (for example, lists of specific spells or combat techniques) are frequently emphasized. Randomization provides a gamble, allowing players to risk more for higher stakes rather than modelling probability. Examples include &quot;&quot;, chess and most computer games.

===Narrativism===
Narrativism relies on outlining (or developing) character motives, placing characters into situations where those motives conflict and making their decisions the driving force. For example, a samurai sworn to honor and obey his lord might be tested when directed to fight his rebellious son; a compassionate doctor might have his charity tested by an enemy soldier under his care; or a student might have to decide whether to help her best friend cheat on an exam.

This has two major effects. Characters usually change and develop over time, and attempts to impose a fixed storyline are impossible or counterproductive. Moments of drama (the characters&#x27; inner conflict) make player responses difficult to predict, and the consequences of such choices cannot be minimized. Revisiting character motives or underlying emotional themes often leads to escalation: asking variations of the same &quot;question&quot; at higher intensity levels.

===Simulationism===
Simulationism is a playing style recreating, or inspired by, a genre or source. Its major concerns are internal consistency, analysis of cause and effect and informed speculation. Characterized by physical interaction and details of setting, simulationism shares with narrativism a concern for character backgrounds, personality traits and motives to model cause and effect in the intellectual and physical realms.

Simulationist players consider their characters independent entities, and behave accordingly; they may be reluctant to have their character act on the basis of out-of-character information. Similar to the distinction between actor and character in a film or play, character generation and the modeling of skill growth and proficiency can be complex and detailed.

Many simulationist RPGs encourage illusionism (manipulation of in-game probability and environmental data to point to predefined conclusions) to create a story. &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; recreates the horror and humanity&#x27;s cosmic insignificance in the Cthulhu Mythos, using illusionism to craft grisly fates for the players&#x27; characters and maintain consistency with the source material.

Simulationism maintains a self-contained universe operating independent of player will; events unfold according to internal rules. Combat may be broken down into discrete, semi-randomised steps for modeling attack skill, weapon weight, defense checks, armor, body parts and damage potential. Some simulationist RPGs explore different aspects of their source material, and may have no concern for realism; &quot;Toon&quot;, for example, emulates cartoon hijinks. Role-playing game systems such as GURPS and Fudge use a somewhat-realistic core system which can be modified with sourcebooks or special rules.

==Terminology==
GNS theory incorporates Jonathan Tweet&#x27;s three forms of task resolution which determine the outcome of an event. According to Edwards, an RPG should use a task-resolution system (or combination of systems) most appropriate for that game&#x27;s GNS perspective. The task-resolution forms are:
* &quot;Drama/destiny:&quot; Participants decide the results, with plot requirements the determining factor (for example, &quot;Houses of the Blooded&quot;).
* &quot;Fortune/chance:&quot; Chance decides the results (for example, dice).
* &quot;Karma/fate:&quot; A fixed value decides the results (for example, &quot;Nobilis&quot;″ statistics comparison. Jenna K. Moran&#x27;s work frequently takes inspiration from software development methodologies). 
Edwards has said that he changed the name of the Threefold Model&#x27;s &quot;drama&quot; type to &quot;narrativism&quot; in GNS theory to avoid confusion with the &quot;drama&quot; task-resolution system.

GNS theory identifies five elements of role-playing:
* &quot;Character:&quot; A fictional person
* &quot;Color:&quot; Details providing atmosphere
* &quot;Setting:&quot; Location in space and time
* &quot;Situation:&quot; The dilemma
* &quot;System:&quot; Determines how in-game events unfold

It details four stances the player may take in making decisions for their character:
* &quot;Actor:&quot; Decides based on what their character wants and knows
* &quot;Author:&quot; Decides based on what they want for their character, retrospectively explaining why their character made a decision
* &quot;Director:&quot; Makes decisions affecting the environment instead of a character (usually represented by a gamemaster in an RPG)
* &quot;Pawn:&quot; Decides based on what they want for their character, without explaining why their character made a decision

==Criticism==
Brian Gleichman, a self-identified Gamist whose works Edwards cited in his examination of Gamism, wrote an extensive critique of the GNS theory and the Big Model. He states that although any RPG intuitively contains elements of gaming, storytelling, and self-consistent simulated worlds, the GNS theory &quot;mistakes components of an activity for the goals of the activity&quot;, emphasizes player typing over other concerns, and assumes &quot;without reason&quot; that there are only three possible goals in all of role-playing. Combined with the principles outlined in &quot;System Does Matter&quot;, this produces a new definition of RPG, in which its traditional components (challenge, story, consistency) are mutually exclusive, and any game system that mixes them is labeled as &quot;incoherent&quot; and thus inferior to the &quot;coherent&quot; ones. To disprove this, Gleichman cites a survey conducted by Wizards of the Coast in 1999, which identified four player types and eight &quot;core values&quot; (instead of the three predicted by the GNS theory) and found that these are neither exclusive, nor strongly correlated with particular game systems. Gleichman concludes that the GNS theory is &quot;logically flawed&quot;, &quot;fails completely in its effort to define or model RPGs as most people think of them&quot;, and &quot;will produce something that is basically another type of game completely&quot;.

Gleichman also states that just as the Threefold Model (developed by self-identified Simulationists who &quot;didn&#x27;t really understand any other style of player besides their own&quot;) &quot;uplifted&quot; Simulation, Edwards&#x27; GNS theory &quot;trumpets&quot; its definition of Narrativism. According to him, Edwards&#x27; view of Simulationism as &quot;&#x27;a form of retreat, denial, and defense against the responsibilities of either Gamism or Narrativism&#x27;&quot; and characterization of Gamism as &quot;being more akin to board games&quot; than to RPGs, reveals an elitist attitude surrounding the narrow GNS definition of narrative role-playing, which attributes enjoyment of any incompatible play-style to &quot;&#x27;[literal] brain damage&#x27;&quot;. Lastly, Gleichman states that most games rooted in the GNS theory, e.g. &quot;My Life with Master&quot; and &quot;Dogs in the Vineyard&quot;, &quot;actually failed to support Narrativism as a whole, instead focusing on a single Narrativist theme&quot;, and have had no commercial success.

Fantasy author and &quot;Legend of the Five Rings&quot; contributor Marie Brennan reviews the GNS theory in the eponymous chapter of her 2017 non-fiction book &quot;Dice Tales&quot;. While she finds many of its &quot;elaborations and add-ons that accreted over the years... less than useful&quot;, she suggests that the &quot;core concepts of GNS can be helpful in elucidating some aspects of [RPGs], ranging from game design to the disputes that arise between players&quot;. A self-identified Narrativist, Brennan finds Edwards&#x27; definition of said creative agenda (&quot;exploration of theme&quot;) too narrow, adding &quot;character development, suspense, exciting plot twists, and everything else that makes up a good story&quot; to the Narrativist priorities list. She concludes that rather than being a practical guide, GNS is more useful for explaining the general ideas of role-playing and especially &quot;for understanding how gamers behave&quot;.

The role-playing game historian Shannon Appelcline (author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;) drew parallels between three of his contemporary commercial categories of RPG products and the three basic categories of GNS. He posited that &quot;OSR games are largely gamist and indie games are largely narrativist&quot;, while &quot;the mainstream games... tend toward simulationist on average&quot;, and cautiously concluded that this &quot;makes you think that Edwards was on to something&quot;.

Noted participant of the Forge, contributor to GNS theory, and developer of many role-playing games, Vincent Baker, has said that &quot;the model is obsolete,&quot; and discussed that trying to fit play into the boxes provided by the model may contribute to misunderstanding it.

<doc id="322871" wikidata="Q439167" url="?curid=322871" title="Maud Carnegie, Countess of Southesk">
<text>Maud Carnegie, Countess of Southesk (born Lady Maud Alexandra Victoria Georgina Bertha Duff; 3 April 1893 – 14 December 1945), titled Princess Maud from 1905 to 1923, was a granddaughter of Edward VII. Maud and her elder sister, Alexandra, had the distinction of being the only female-line descendants of a British sovereign officially granted both the title of &quot;Princess&quot; and the style of &quot;Highness&quot;.

Although Princess Maud did not otherwise carry out royal engagements, because of her position in the Commonwealth&#x27;s order of succession she served as a Counsellor of State between 1942 and 1945.

==Early life==
Maud was born at East Sheen Lodge, Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey, on 3 April 1893. Her father was Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife. He was raised from Earl to Duke of Fife following marriage to Maud&#x27;s mother, Princess Louise of Wales, the third child and eldest daughter of the future King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

Maud was christened on 22 June 1893 in the Chapel Royal of St James&#x27;s Palace.

Maud and her sister were unique in sharing descent from both King William IV (through his mistress, Dorothea Jordan), and William IV&#x27;s niece, Queen Victoria, who succeeded him because he left no legitimate issue.

==Princess==

In 1900, Queen Victoria granted Maud&#x27;s father a second dukedom of Fife in the peerage of the United Kingdom with a special remainder providing for the succession of the duke&#x27;s daughters and their male-line descendants to the title, in default of a male heir. Maud became second in line to the dukedom, after her elder sister Alexandra, and her descendants would eventually succeed to the peerage.

As a cognatic great-granddaughter of a British monarch (Queen Victoria), Maud was not entitled to the title of a Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland nor to the attribute &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. Instead she was styled &quot;Lady Maud Duff&quot;, as the daughter of a duke. She was fifth in the line of succession to the British throne at the time of her birth.

On 9 November 1905, King Edward VII gave (on the occasion of his birthday) Maud&#x27;s mother the title of Princess Royal. He further ordered Garter King of Arms to gazette Maud and her sister with the style and attribute of &quot;Highness&quot; and the style of Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names, with precedence immediately after all members of the British royal family bearing the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

She took part in the carriage procession for members of the royal family when she attended the state funeral of Edward VII in 1910 (she was styled in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; as &quot;Her Highness Princess Maud&quot; and her sister &quot;Her Highness Princess Alexandra&quot;, both without the territorial designation &quot;of Fife&quot;). She attended the coronation of her uncle, George V, on 22 June 1911 with the royal family, styled as &quot;Her Highness Princess Maud&quot; (without territorial designation).

Maud&#x27;s uncle, King George V, in letters patent dated 20 November 1917, restructured the styles and titles of the royal family by restricting the titles of Prince or Princess and the style of Royal Highness to the children of the sovereign, the children of the sovereign&#x27;s sons, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The Letters Patent also stated that &quot;the titles of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness, and the titular dignity of Prince and Princess shall cease except those titles already granted and remaining unrevoked&quot;. This had no direct effect on Maud and her sister, whose rank and style derived from the specific promotions granted to them by their grandfather, Edward VII, and George V took no further action to retract the royal warrant conferring the princely title and attribute upon them. Maud therefore continued to use her princely title until her 1923 marriage. Upon her marriage to Charles, Lord Carnegie, however, she chose to be known as &quot;Lady Maud Carnegie&quot; (or, from 1941, &quot;the Countess of Southesk&quot;), dropping her princely title however remained legally a British princess until her death.

She rode in the carriage procession with members of the royal family at the funeral of George V in 1936; on this occasion she was styled in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; as &quot;Lady Maud Carnegie&quot;. She also attended the coronation of her first cousin George VI in May 1937, taking part in the procession of members of the royal family, and was officially styled as Lady Maud Carnegie.

==Marriage==
On 13 November 1923, Maud married Charles, Lord Carnegie (23 September 1893 – 16 February 1992) at the Royal Military Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London. Lord Carnegie was the eldest son of Charles Noel Carnegie, 10th Earl of Southesk and inherited the title of Earl of Southesk on his father&#x27;s death on 10 November 1941.

Maud and her husband operated a model farm from Elsick House, in Kincardineshire, Scotland. They had one child, James (23 September 1929 – 22 June 2015).

==Girl Guides==
Maud was a devoted supporter of the Girl Guides movement. She was a County Commissioner in Angus and Aberdeenshire and a member of the executive committee in Scotland. She was a recipient of the Silver Fish Award, Girl Guiding&#x27;s highest adult honour, in 1937.

==Later life, illness and death==

Princess Maud consistently appeared at the Court of St. James&#x27;s among the royal family, although she did not undertake official or public duties. During George VI&#x27;s absence in Africa in 1943, Maud served as a Counsellor of State. At the time of her death in 1945, she was thirteenth in line to the British throne and heir presumptive to the dukedom of Fife, since her sister&#x27;s only son Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, had died in 1943. Maud&#x27;s only son James, Lord Carnegie, succeeded his aunt as 3rd Duke of Fife in 1959. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles in 1992.

Princess Maud died in a London nursing home on 14 December 1945 after a bout of acute bronchitis. Her will was sealed in Llandudno in 1946. Her estate was valued at £44,008 (or £1.2 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

<text>Hispania Tarraconensis was one of three Roman provinces in Hispania. It encompassed much of the northern, eastern and central territories of modern Spain along with modern northern Portugal. Southern Spain, the region now called Andalusia, was the province of Hispania Baetica. On the Atlantic west lay the province of Lusitania, partially coincident with modern-day Portugal.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Phoenicians and Carthaginians colonised the Mediterranean coast of Iberia in the 8th to 6th centuries BC. The Greeks later also established colonies along the coast. The Romans arrived in the 2nd century BC during the Second Punic War.

The province Hispania Citerior Tarraconensis was established in the reign of Augustus as the direct successor of the Roman Republican province of Hispania Citerior (&quot;nearer Hispania&quot;), which had been ruled by a propraetor. The roots of the Augustan reorganisation of Hispania are found in Pompey the Great&#x27;s division of Hispania between three of his legates at the end of the Republic, immediately before his civil war with Julius Caesar. As a result of the agreements that led to the formation of the First Triumvirate in 60 BC, Pompey had received the governorship of the Iberian provinces. Given that he preferred to remain in Rome, where he could oversee affairs in the capital, he delegated the government of Hispania to three legates:
*Lucius Afranius in Hispania Citerior, with three legions;
*Marcus Petreius in the eastern part of Hispania Ulterior, with two legions;
*Marcus Terentius Varro in the western part of Hispania Ulterior, with two legions.
At the end of the civil wars, Pompey&#x27;s division was consolidated by Augustus in 27 BC, when he formally established the three provinces of Hispania Citerior Tarraconensis, Hispania Ulterior Lusitania (corresponding to modern Portugal, apart from the northern region of the modern country, plus Spanish Extremadura), and Hispania Ulterior Baetica (corresponding to the southern part of Spain, i.e. Andalusia). Citerior and Lusitania were Imperial provinces, while Baetica was a Senatorial province.

The creation of these new provinces was achieved in order to facilitate the incorporation of the northwestern portion of the Iberian peninsula, inhabited by the Gallaeci, Cantabri, and Astures, into the Roman empire. Tarraconensis thus served as a base for the annexation of these territories during the Cantabrian Wars (27–19 BC). Augustus himself resided from 27 to 26 BC at Segisama (modern Sasamón, Burgos), and at Tarraco, where he received an embassy from India. During this period he was accompanied by his nephew and heir, Marcellus, and his stepson, the future emperor Tiberius, both of whom served as military tribunes in 25 BC in the conflict with the Cantabrians – the pair&#x27;s first military commands.

The name of the province derives from its capital, &quot;Colonia Urbs Triumphalis Tarraco&quot;. The provincial borders were modified in 12 BC, in order to incorporate the Galician and Asturian territories which had previously belonged to Lusitania, and perhaps to an ephemeral Transduriana province before that, as well as the mining area around Castulo that had previously been part of Baetica. This reorganisation meant that all Roman troops stationed in Hispania were henceforth under the command of a single Roman legate based at Tarraconensis and that the main mining regions, which supplied precious metals to the Imperial treasury (gold in the Galician Massif, silver in Sierra Morena), were under the direct control of the Imperial administration, with easy access by sea to Italia and Rome, where the Imperial mints were located.

=== Pacification and Romanisation under the Julio-Claudians and Flavians ===
In addition to creating the province and setting its borders, Augustus followed the directions left by Julius Caesar in granting many communities in the province the privileged status of &quot;colonia&quot; or &quot;municipium&quot; (Roman or Latin), especially along the Levante coast, the part of Baetica transferred to the province in 12 BC, and the Ebro Valley, along with some foundations on the Meseta Central and in the northeast. He also regularised the status of the other political entities in the province, the &quot;civitates stipendiaria&quot; (communities subject to tribute), whose affairs could be directly intervened in by the governor.

This policy was continued by Tiberius (AD 14–37), who increased the number of &quot;municipia&quot; in the northern part of the Meseta Central.

Between the reigns of Augustus and Nero, imperial interventions led to the regularisation of the old pre-Roman roads and their conversion into Roman roads, which formed a framework for the provincial territory which brought the provincials into contact with Roman culture (Latin rapidly became the common language of the province) and gave them access to highly developed economic networks and a monetary economy. Ceramics began to be imported in large quantities - Arretine ware from Italy under Augustus and Tiberius and Samian ware from Gaul between the reigns of Caligula and Vespasian.

The province was effectively at peace except for an attempt at rebellion by the Astures under Nero which was easily suppressed by a &quot;primus pilus&quot; of the &quot;Legio VI Victrix&quot;. As a result, it was possible to progressively reduce the military garrison of the province. In AD 42-43, Claudius transferred the &quot;Legio IV Macedonica&quot; to Germania and in AD 63 Nero sent the Legio X Gemina to Pannonia.
In AD 68, Galba, who had governed the province since AD 61, was invited by Vindex to join his rebellion against Nero. When Galba received news that Nero had decided to have him killed, he accepted Vindex&#x27;s offer, justifying the decision, according to Suetonius, by an oracle delivered by a young prophet two centuries earlier, which predicted that a new ruler of the world would arise in Clunia.

Therefore, Galba proclaimed himself emperor at Clunia. After receiving the support of the governor of Lusitania, the future emperor Otho, he expanded the military forces of the province, which consisted of the Legio VI Victrix, two cavalry alae, and three infantry cohortes, by recruiting various auxiliaries, at least three cohorts of Vascones, and the Legio VII Galbiana, and then he set out for Rome in order to seize power. After Galba was assassinated, the province was controlled in succession by partisans of Otho, then Vitelius, before finally coming under the control of Vespasian, the first Flavian emperor.

Under Vespasian an edict seems to have been promulgated, perhaps in AD 74, which permitted many of the province&#x27;s urban communities to become &quot;municipia&quot; with Latin rights over the course of his reign and that of his successors, Titus and Domitian. Vespasian also decided to maintain a reduced military garrison in the province, consisting of the Legio VII Gemina Felix and its auxiliary units, which was focused mainly on supporting the work of the provincial governor, carrying out policing, and supervising mining work in the province.

Pliny the Elder served as procurator in Tarraconensis in AD 73.

Under Diocletian, in 293, Hispania Tarraconensis was divided in three smaller provinces: Gallaecia, Carthaginensis and Tarraconensis. The Imperial province of Hispania Tarraconensis lasted until the invasions of the 5th century, beginning in 409, when Suebi, Vandals and Alans crossed the Pyrenees, and ended with the establishment of a Visigothic kingdom.

The invasion resulted in widespread exploitation of metals, especially gold, tin and silver. The alluvial gold mines at Las Medulas show that Roman engineers worked the deposits on a very large scale using several aqueducts up to long to tap water in the surrounding mountains. By running fast water streams on the soft rocks, they were able to extract large quantities of gold by hydraulic mining methods (Ruina montium). When the gold had been exhausted, they followed the auriferous seams underground by tunnels using fire-setting to break up the much harder gold-bearing rocks. Pliny the Elder gives a good account of the methods used in Hispania, presumably based on his own observations.

== Geography and political organisation ==
=== Borders and extent ===
At its greatest extent, the province Hispania Tarraconensis covered about two thirds of the Iberian Peninsula. The Pyrenees mountains to the north formed the border with Gaul. The border with Lusitania to the southwest ran from the Cale (modern Oporto, Portugal) along the Douro river and then the Tormes river. The border with Baetica ran from Castulo (modern Linares), through Acci (Guadix), to the bay of Almería.

With a surface area of around 380,000 km2 and an estimated population of 3-3.5 million (giving an average population density of 8-9 people/km2), at the date of its creation, Tarraconensis was probably the largest province in the Roman empire.

=== Administrative organisation ===
Under Augustus&#x27; division of the provinces in 27 BC, Tarraconensis was an Imperial province like Lusitania, while Baetica was a Senatorial province. Tarraconensis was of consular rank, while the other two were praetorian. The governor was entitled &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;, who was a senator of consular rank. The capital of the province was the colonia of Tarraco. In the time of Augustus and Tiberius, according to Strabo, the province was garrisoned by three legions – subsequently reduced to two by Caligula, and to one by Nero.

Because of the scale of the province, at some point between the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius, the province was divided into seven &quot;conventus iuridici&quot; (assize districts), each managed by a &quot;legatus iuridicus&quot;, who was appointed by the Emperor directly. These districts were:

* &quot;Tarraconensis&quot;, with its capital at &quot;Colonia Tarraco&quot; (Tarragona).
* &quot;Carthaginensis&quot;, with its capital at &quot;Colonia Carthago Nova&quot; (Cartagena).
* &quot;Caesaraugustanus&quot;, with its capital at &quot;Colonia Caesar Augusta&quot; (Zaragoza).
* &quot;Cluniensis&quot;, with its capital at &quot;Colonia Clunia Sulpicia&quot; (Coruña del Conde).
* &quot;Asturicensis&quot;, with its capital at &quot;Municipium Asturica Augusta&quot; (Astorga).
* &quot;Lucensis&quot;, with its capital at &quot;Lucus Augusti&quot; (Lugo).
* &quot;Bracarensis&quot;, with its capital at &quot;Municipium Bracara Augusta&quot; (Braga).

In each of the conventus capitals there was an Imperial cult centre, dedicated to the Genius Augusti and the deified emperors, with its own male and female priests, the &quot;flamen Augusti&quot; and &quot;flamenica Augusti&quot;, who were chosen by the elites of the privileged communities of the province (the &quot;coloniae&quot; and &quot;municipia&quot;). Each year, they chose one of their number to be the &quot;flamen&quot; and &quot;flamenica&quot; (they were not required to be married to one another) of the Imperial cult for the whole province, discharging their functions in the provincial forum in Tarraco.

The fiscal administration of Tarraconensis mostly fell to an Imperial procurator (&quot;procurator Caesaris&quot;), appointed by the Emperor directly from among the equestrian order. This procurator was based in the provincial capital and managed the collection of taxes for the whole province. Nevertheless, from the late first century or early second century AD, the gold mines in the northwestern part of the province were managed by a separate procurator, the &quot;procurator metallorum&quot;, who was usually and Imperial freedman and was based at &quot;Asturica Augusta&quot;. These procurators reported directly to the emperor, not to the provincial governor, although in practice both had to collaborate with the provincial administration.

=== Urban framework ===
The lowest level of administration in the province were the cities (Latin: &quot;civitates&quot;), organised politically in the Roman manner (&quot;coloniae&quot; and &quot;municipia&quot;) or in a traditional mode retaining institutions that preceded the Roman conquest but operating under the direct supervision of the provincial governors. These communities - both Roman and indigenous - generally enjoyed a high level of autonomy, administering themselves without excessive intervention from the governors. Over time, the indigenous communities tended to adapt their institutions of self-government to match the model of the Roman &quot;municipia&quot; and &quot;coloniae&quot;. The principal difference between the two types of community was the application of Roman law to them. For citizens of &quot;coloniae&quot; and &quot;muncipia&quot; it was obligatory, while for non-Romans it was optional, except in interactions with the Imperial authorities and with individual Roman citizens, in which case Roman law over-ruled local legal systems.

According to Strabo, Pliny the Elder (who served as procurator the province), and Claudius Ptolemy, there was a substantial number of cities in Tarraconensis, especially in the Ebro Valley and on the Mediterranean coast, but fewer in number in the north and northwest, along the Cantabiran coast and in Galicia.

Excepting the communities on the Balearic Islands, Pliny states that:


All free inhabitants of Roman &quot;coloniae&quot; held Roman citizenship. The &quot;coloniae&quot; in the province, established by Julius Caesar, the Second Triumvirate, or Augustus, both &quot;coloniae&quot; and &quot;municipia&quot; belonged to the Roman tribe of Galeria, except for Caesaraugusta, which was in that of Aniensis. All free men who served as municipal magistrates (duoviri or aediles) in &quot;municipia&quot; would obtain Roman citizenship, being assigned to the tribe Quirina.

According to Pliny the Elder, the Emperor Vespasian extended Latin citizenship to all other inhabitants of Hispania, which meant that they were legally permitted to conduct business under Roman law (&quot;ius commercii&quot;) and marry Roman woman (&quot;ius conubii&quot;). The date of this grant is disputed, perhaps falling shortly after his accession to power in AD 69 or in AD 74. The concession of this right was used by many tributary and subordinate communities in Tarraconensis to transform themselves into &quot;municipia&quot;, e.g. &quot;Nova Augusta&quot; (Lara de los Infantes, Burgos), &quot;Bergidum Flavium&quot; (Torre del Bierzo, El Bierzo, León), &quot;Segovia&quot;, Duratón (Segovia), and &quot;Aqua Flaviae&quot; (Chaves, Portugal).



The main cities in the province were:

=== Roman military garrisons ===
In order to guarantee order and security in the province after the Cantabrian Wars (26 BC–19 BC), three legions were established in the province:
* &quot;Legio VI Victrix&quot;, in Leon until transferred to Germania Inferior;
* &quot;Legio X Gemina&quot; in Petavonium until transferred to Pannonia in AD 63;
* &quot;Legio IV Macedonica&quot; in Pisoraca until transferred to Germania in AD 43.

These legions were supported by various auxiliary units, like the &quot;Ala Parthorum&quot; and the &quot;Cohors IV Gallorum&quot;, but it is very difficult to tell exactly where and when these units were garrisoned in the peninsula.

In AD 68, according to Suetonius, Galba removed one legion, the &quot;Legio VI Vitrix&quot;, two cavalry &quot;alae&quot;, and three infantry &quot;cohortes&quot;. In order to reinforce these troops, a new legion was recruited, the future &quot;Legio VII Gemina&quot; and a number of similar auxiliary units, notably the Vascones &quot;cohortes&quot;, but all these units joined Galba when he invaded Italy to seize the Imperial throne.

In AD 69, Vitellius ordered the &quot;Legio X Gemina&quot; to be dispatched to the Iberian peninsula, accompanied by the &quot;Legio I Adiutrix&quot;. We do not know exactly where they were stationed; it may have been in Baetica and the southeastern part of Tarraconensis to prevent a possible invasion from North Africa, which was controlled by Lucius Clodius Macer. In any case, both legions and the &quot;Legio VI Victrix&quot; abandoned Vitellius and declared their support for Vespasian, who quickly sent them to Germania Inferior to suppress the revolt of Gaius Julius Civilis.

Subsequently, in AD 74, Vespasian ordered the &quot;Legio VII Gemina&quot; to be garrisoned in Leon at the site of the old camp of the &quot;Legio VI Victrix&quot;. The &quot;Legio VII Gemina&quot; continued to garrison the province until the beginning of the 5th century AD.
The &quot;Legio VII Gemina&quot; dispatched &quot;vexillationes&quot; to the following parts of the provinces in Hispania:
* Tarraco, serving the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis;
* Augusta Emerita, serving the governor of the province of Lusitania;
* In the mining area around Birgidum to supervise the extraction of mineral ore and its transportation;
* In the mining area in the north of Portugal, to supervise the extraction of gold ore and its transportation;
* In Tritium Magallum (Tricio, La Rioja) to manage the &quot;portorium&quot; of this pottery production centre;
* In Lucus Augusti (Lugo) to manage the &quot;portorium&quot;;
* In Segisama (Sasamón, Burgos) at the &quot;statio&quot;, controlling the road towards Burdigala.

By the last quarter of the 1st century AD at the latest, five auxiliary units of the &quot;Legio VII Gemina&quot; were stationed in the province:
* &quot;Ala II Flavia Hispanorum civium romanorum&quot;, a cavalry &quot;ala&quot; stationed at Petavonium;
* &quot;Cohors I Celtiberorum Equitata civium romanorum&quot;, a cavalry &quot;cohors&quot;, based at Sobrado dos Monxes (A Coruña), in the territory of the &quot;Municipum Flavium Brigantia&quot;;
* &quot;Cohors I Galica Equitata civium romanorum&quot;, encamped at Pisoraca (Herrera de Pisuerga, Palencia);
* &quot;Cohors III Lucensium&quot;, based at Lucus Augusti (Lugo);
* &quot;Cohors II Galica&quot;, located at the unknown site, &quot;ad cohortem Galicam&quot;

This arrangement endured from the 2nd century through to the fifth century AD, with the maximum garrison of Roman troops in Hispanis never exceeding a total of 7712 soldiers.

<text>Garin de Monglane is a fictional aristocrat who gives his name to the second cycle of Old French &quot;chansons de geste&quot;, &quot;La Geste de Garin de Monglane&quot;. His cycle tells stories of fiefless lads of noble birth who went off seeking land and adventure fighting the Saracens.

The several heroes who rode off seeking war and wealth in this way are given genealogies that made Garin de Monglane their common ancestor. Apart from fathering a race of landless knights, Garin de Monglane himself is a character whose portrait in the poems is otherwise drawn very sketchily. Poems belonging to the Garin cycle include the &quot;chansons&quot; of &quot;Girart de Vienne&quot;, &quot;Aimeri de Narbonne&quot;, and &quot;Guillaume&quot;. Of these poems, &quot;Aimeri de Narbonne&quot; has the largest literary interest.

William N. R. Beall was born in Bardstown, Kentucky on March 20, 1825. His parents moved from Kentucky to Little Rock, Arkansas where Beall was raised.

After graduating 30th in his class from the United States Military Academy in 1848, Beall was commissioned in the United States Army as a brevet second lieutenant with the U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment. He first served on the northwestern frontier. In 1849, he was promoted to second lieutenant and assigned to the Fifth Infantry, serving until 1855 in the Indian Territory and Texas. He was promoted to first lieutenant and then shortly thereafter to captain with the First Cavalry. Beall was involved in several skirmishes, combats, and expeditions against the Indian tribes in the West, primarily in Kansas. In 1860, he participated in a raid against the Kiowas and Comanches.

==Civil War==
At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Beall resigned his commission and was appointed as a captain of cavalry in the Confederate Army. Beall served in the Trans-Mississippi Department under General Earl Van Dorn early in the war and was appointed brigadier general in the spring of 1862. Beall was placed in command of the Confederate cavalry forces at Corinth, Mississippi. Beall then commanded a brigade of troops from Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. At the Siege of Port Hudson, the Confederate forces surrendered on July 9, 1863, and Beall was taken as a prisoner of war. He was imprisoned at Johnson&#x27;s Island on Lake Erie near Sandusky, Ohio.

In 1864, Beall was appointed as a Confederate agent for the purpose of supplying Confederate prisoners of war and paroled for this purpose. He established an office in New York City and sold cotton allowed through the Union blockade of southern ports. The proceeds from these sales were used to purchase clothing and blankets for Confederate prisoners in northern prison camps. On January 3, 1865, Union General Henry Halleck wrote to General Ulysses Grant regarding Beall: 
: &quot;Since commencing this letter I learn that General Beall&#x27;s course of conduct in New York has been so conspicuous and offensive that the Secretary of War has ordered his sign to be taken down. General Paine has also been directed to suspend his parole and take him in custody till the cotton arrives. The selection of General Beall was unfortunate, for he seems disposed to make all the trouble he can. His parole will be renewed the moment the cotton reaches New York.&quot;

Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton suspended Beall&#x27;s parole and placed him in Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor as a prisoner of war until the cotton safely arrived from Mobile, Alabama. He was finally released from Federal custody on August 2, 1865. After the war, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri and became a general commission merchant.

==Dates of rank==
* Captain, September 1, 1861
* Brigadier General, April 11, 1862

==Postbellum==
Beall died on July 25, 1883, in McMinnville, Tennessee. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

<doc id="322882" wikidata="Q827111" url="?curid=322882" title="Teiidae">
<text>Teiidae is a family of Lacertoidean lizards native to the Americas. Members of this family are generally known as whiptails or racerunners; however, [[tegu]]s also belong to this family. Teiidae is sister to the Gymnopthalmidae, and both families comprise the Teiioidea. The Teiidae includes several parthenogenic species – a mode of clonal reproduction. Presently, the Teiidae consists of approximately 150 species in eighteen genera.

==Morphology and behavior==
Teiids can be distinguished from other lizards by the following characteristics: large rectangular scales that form distinct transverse rows ventrally and generally small granular scales dorsally, head scales that are separate from the skull bones, and teeth that are solid at the base and &quot;glued&quot; to the jaw bones. Additionally, all teiids have a forked, snake-like tongue. They all possess well-developed limbs.

Teiids are all terrestrial (few are semi-aquatic) and diurnal, and are primarily carnivorous or insectivorous. Most teiids forage quite actively within their ideal temperature range, quickly skirting between cover objects. Some will include a small amount of plant matter in their diet. They are oviparous, and some species lay very large clutches.

==Parthenogenesis==
Several species of whiptail lizards are entirely female and no males are known. These all-female species reproduce by obligate parthenogenesis (obligate, because the lizards do not involve males and cannot reproduce sexually). Like all squamate obligate parthenogenetic lineages, parthenogenetic teiids are hybrids. Two or more species rarely hybridize and the offspring are thought to occasionally be capable of reproduction without sperm. The meiotic mechanism for bypassing fertilization is an ongoing area of research.

Primarily known from lab studies of parthenogenetic &quot;Aspidoscelis neomexicanus&quot;, simulated mating behavior can increase fertility. In this behavior known as pseudocopulation, one female assumes a male-like role and the other a female-like role. Individuals can switch roles throughout their life. The claim of pseudocopulation was initially met with hesitation by some researchers, and the behavior has not been observed in all parthenogenetic varieties. Since at least some all-female lineages exhibit pseudocopulation, these lizards can be considered to reproduce unisexually (in contrast to asexually).

== Fossil record ==
Teiids are known to have briefly occurred in Europe during the Late Eocene based on fragmentary fossil material non-diagnostic to the genus level found in the Quercy Phosphorites Formation of France dating to the MP 17 zone.

==Taxonomy==
The Teiidae contains approximately 150 species divided into two subfamilies and 18 genera. This assessment includes several recent changes: three resurrected genera, five newly described genera, and the large genus &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot; split into &quot;Aspidoscelis&quot; and &quot;Cnemidophorus&quot;. In some technical literature, the Teiidae are referred to as macroteiids (in opposition to the microteiids, which are members of a sister family Gymnopthalmidae). Parthenogenetic lineages are generally referred to as species, though the concept of a species is meant loosely. Other terms include array, clone, type, or morph.

<text>Cordylidae is a family of small- to medium-sized lizards that occur in southern and eastern Africa. They are commonly known as girdled lizards, spinytail lizards, or girdle-tail lizards.

Cordylidae is closely related to the family Gerrhosauridae, occurring in Africa and Madagascar. These two scientific families of lizards, known as Cordyliformes or Cordyloidea, are sometimes combined into a larger concept of Cordylidae. Recent molecular analyses confirm the clade made up of Cordylidae and Gerrhosauridae (Cordyloidea) and place it in a larger clade including Xantusiidae (Cordylomorpha Vidal &amp; Hedges, 2009).

== Description and behavior ==

Girdled lizards are diurnal and insectivorous. They are terrestrial, mostly inhabiting crevices in rocky terrain, although at least one species digs burrows and another lives under exfoliating bark on trees. They have flattened heads and bodies, and are distinguished by a heavy armour of osteoderms and large, rectangular, scales, arranged in regular rows around the body and tail. Many species have rings of spines on the tail, that aid in wedging the animal into sheltering crevices, and also in dissuading predators.

Most species have four limbs, but those in the genus &quot;Chamaesaura&quot; are almost entirely limbless, with only tiny spikes in place of the hind limbs. The family includes both egg-laying and ovoviviparous species.

<doc id="322889" wikidata="Q1056123" url="?curid=322889" title="Suffolk University">
<text>Suffolk University is a private research university in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. With 7,560 students on all campuses, it is the tenth-largest university in metropolitan Boston. It was founded as a law school in 1906 and named after its location in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. The university is also host to its namesake public opinion poll, the Suffolk University Political Research Center.

The university, located at the downtown edge of the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood, comprises the Suffolk College of Arts and Sciences, Sawyer Business School, and Suffolk University Law School. The university&#x27;s sports teams, the Suffolk Rams, compete in 19 varsity sports in NCAA Division III as members of the Commonwealth Coast Conference.

==History==
Suffolk University was initially founded as a law school in 1906 by Boston lawyer Gleason Archer Sr., who named it Archer&#x27;s Evening Law School, intending it for law students who worked during the day. The school was renamed Suffolk School of Law in 1907, after Archer moved it from his Roxbury, Massachusetts home into his law offices in downtown Boston.

A year later the first of Archer&#x27;s students had passed the bar, leading to a boost in registration. The school&#x27;s original goal was to &quot;serve ambitious young men who are obliged to work for a living while studying law.&quot;

By 1930, Archer developed Suffolk into one of the largest law schools in the country, and decided to create &quot;a great evening university&quot; that working people could afford.

The school became a university in the 1930s when the Suffolk College of Arts and Sciences was founded in 1934 and the Sawyer Business School—then known as the College of Business Administration—in 1937. That same year, the three academic units were incorporated as Suffolk University.

During the 1990s Suffolk constructed its first residence halls, began satellite programs with other colleges in Massachusetts, and opened its international campuses. From 1990 to 2005, its endowment increased over 400%, to approximately $72 million, and enrollment climbed.

==Campus==
The main campus in downtown Boston is situated on well-known Beacon Hill, adjacent to the Massachusetts State House and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Up until 1995, Suffolk was a commuter-only school. Today, there are five coed residence halls, housing over 65% of freshman, and a total of 24% of the entire undergraduate population:
*Smith Hall
*Nathan R. Miller Hall
*10 West
*Modern Theatre
*One Court Street

The residence hall at 150 Tremont Street, renamed Smith Hall in 2018, was the first built by the university and currently houses students in singles, doubles, quads, and suites, with communal bathrooms.

Nathan R. Miller Residence Hall (located at 10 Somerset St.) was opened in 2005 and houses 15 floors of freshman, and 2 floors of sophomores in singles, doubles and quads, with bathrooms shared between every two rooms or one bathroom per quad.

The 10 West Residence Hall, opened in 2008, has housing for freshman and sophomores in singles and doubles. Suites accommodate 3-5 students and a variety of apartment-style suites (that include full kitchens) house 2 to 8 students.

Both Miller Hall and 150 Tremont have cafeterias. Students living at 10 West/Modern Theater can eat at 150 Tremont. Suffolk University occasionally leases additional properties (such as the Hyatt &amp; Holiday Inn Beacon Hill). If leased, those locations house freshman students.

The Modern Theatre Residence Hall opened in the fall of 2010 and is considered an extension to the 10 West Resident Hall. The two residence halls share one entrance at 10 West Street. The Modern Theater Residence Hall is built over the restored Modern Theatre (Boston).

In the fall of 2020, the university added a new residence hall, the Ames Building at One Court Street, which it purchased in the fall of 2019.

On June 26, 2024, Suffolk University announced plans for a sixth residence hall after the purchase of a new property. President Marisa Kelly said that 101 Tremont Street across from Granary Burial Ground will be converted to an 11-story residence hall following their pending permit and review process of the city of Boston. 

==Academics==
Suffolk employs over 900 full-time and adjunct faculty members, who instruct approximately 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its Boston Campus.

The Sawyer Business School (previously the Sawyer School of Management) focuses on global business education. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees. Joint degrees are also offered. About 3,000 students are currently enrolled in all programs. The Saturday-only Executive MBA Program incorporates four off-site one-week seminars and week-long global trips to Madrid and China. The Global MBA is a specialized MBA in international business with an intensive concentration in either finance or marketing. The full-time program includes a 3-month internship outside the student&#x27;s home country. Summer 2010 Global MBA internships are in 10 countries. Part-time Global MBAs complete either a global experiential research project at their place of business or a 3-month consulting project that includes an intensive 2 week residency outside the US.

The Suffolk College of Arts and Sciences has seventeen academic departments which offer more than seventy undergraduate and graduate programs. Among the departments is the New England School of Art and Design (NESAD)

Suffolk University Law School, founded in 1906, offers a standard Juris Doctor program and advanced L.L.M. program. 43% of applicants were admitted to the J.D. program in 2005.

The university is also home to various research centers and institutes, including the Centers for Crime &amp; Justice Policy Research, Restorative Justice, and Women&#x27;s Health and Human Right, the Moakley Archives, the Poetry Center, Political Research Centers, and the Sagan Energy Research Laboratory. The Suffolk University Political Research Center (SUPRC) conducts various scientific polls of national and regional political issues.

The university also has an undergraduate honors program in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and Sawyer Business School. Freshman and transfer students are considered for the Honors program upon applying to Suffolk. Students in their second year are considered candidates for the program by remaining one year at the institution with a 3.5 GPA.

==Reputation and rankings==
In 2018 U.S. News ranked Suffolk #177 (tie) in National Universities.

==Athletics==
Suffolk University teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Rams are a member of the Conference of New England and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). They were a member of the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC) from 1995 to 2020. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, indoor and outdoor track and field, golf, ice hockey, soccer and tennis; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, indoor and outdoor track and field, ice hockey, soccer, softball, golf, tennis and volleyball.

<doc id="322892" wikidata="Q5589386" url="?curid=322892" title="Government of the 9th Dáil">
<text>The government of the 9th Dáil was successively the 8th Executive Council of the Irish Free State (21 July – 29 December 1937) and the 1st government of Ireland (29 December 1937 – 30 June 1938). They were led by Éamon de Valera, first as President of the Executive Council and then as Taoiseach. It was formed after the 1937 general election held on 1 July, the same day the new Constitution of Ireland was approved in a plebiscite. Fianna Fáil were continuing in office as a single-party government as they had since the 1932 general election. The 8th Executive Council lasted for until the coming into operation of the new constitution and the 1st Government lasted for .

==8th executive council of the Irish Free State==

===Election of President of the Executive Council===
The 9th Dáil first met on 21 July 1937. In the debate on the election of the President of the Executive Council, Fianna Fáil leader and outgoing President Éamon de Valera was proposed, and the motion was approved by 82 votes to 52.

The election took place under Article 53 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State, as amended by the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936, which had removed the constitutional role of the Governor-General. It was the only time from December 1922 that the head of government was directly elected by the Dáil only; from December 1922 to December 1936, the nomination of the president of the Executive Council was approved by Dáil for appointment by the Governor-General, and since December 1937, the nomination of the Taoiseach has similarly been approved by the Dáil for appointment by the president of Ireland.

===Members of the Executive Council===
The members of the Executive Council were proposed by the President after his election and approved by the Dáil for their appointment by him.
===Parliamentary secretaries===
On 21 July, the Executive Council appointed Parliamentary secretaries on the nomination of the President.
==1st government of Ireland==
Under Article 56 of the Constitution of Ireland, the 8th Executive Council of the Irish Free State led by Éamon de Valera of Fianna Fáil became the 1st Government of Ireland (29 December 1937 – 30 June 1938). The offices of President of the Executive Council and Vice-President of the Executive Council were abolished, and replaced by the offices of Taoiseach and Tánaiste respectively. There was no fresh approval or appointment of the government and no change in the personnel of the Government.

===Parliamentary secretaries===
===Foreign relations===
The government signed the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom on 25 April 1938, which brought the Anglo-Irish trade war to a close and transferred the Treaty Ports to Ireland. These were the ports of Berehaven, Cóbh and Lough Swilly which had stayed under the control of the United Kingdom after the establishment of the Irish Free State.

<text>Gymnophthalmidae is a family of lizards with at least 250 species, sometimes known commonly as spectacled lizards or microteiids. They are called &quot;spectacled&quot; because of their transparent lower eyelids, which allow them to still see with closed eyes. As in most lizards, except geckos, these eyelids are movable. The Alopoglossidae have been recently moved from this family.

==Description and ecology==
Spectacled lizards are related to the Teiidae, but they look like skinks (slightly more distant relatives) with smooth scales. They are generally small lizards; many species have reduced limbs. Unusually among lizards, however, it is generally the hind limbs that are reduced or absent, rather than the forelimbs.

Gymnophthalmids live in a wide variety of habitats, from desert to mountain to rain forest, throughout Central America and South America. They are usually inhabitants of the forest floor or wet areas associated with tropical forests, either nocturnal or intermittently active throughout the day. Spectacled lizards eat mostly insects and other invertebrates, and all species lay eggs. Often they can be found under logs, rocks, or other debris or foraging for small invertebrate prey. Some species are able to dive to escape.

<text>The 7th executive council of the Irish Free State (8 February 1933 – 21 July 1937) was the Executive Council formed after the general election to the 8th Dáil held on 24 January 1933. It was led by Fianna Fáil leader Éamon de Valera as President of the Executive Council, who had first taken office in the Irish Free State after the 1932 general election. It lasted for .

==Nomination of President of the Executive Council==
The 8th Dáil first met on 8 February. In the debate on the nomination of the President of the Executive Council, Fianna Fáil leader and outgoing President Éamon de Valera was proposed, and the motion was approved by 82 votes to 54. He was then appointed as president by Governor-General Domhnall Ua Buachalla.

==Members of the Executive Council==
The members of the Executive Council were proposed by the President and approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the Governor-General on the same day.

==Attorney General==
Conor Maguire SC was appointed by the Governor-General as Attorney General on the nomination of the Executive Council.

==Parliamentary secretaries==
On 8 February, the Executive Council appointed Parliamentary secretaries on the nomination of the President.
==Amendments to the Constitution of the Irish Free State==
The following amendments to the Constitution of the Irish Free State were proposed by the Executive Council and passed by the Oireachtas.
* Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933 (3 May 1933): Abolished the Oath of Allegiance and removed requirements that the constitution and laws of the Free State be compatible with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. This involved repealing Section 2 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act 1922, as well as altering provisions of the constitution.
* Amendment No. 20 (2 November 1933): Removed the Governor General&#x27;s role in recommending appropriations of money to the Dáil on the advice of the Executive Council. This function was transferred directly to the Executive Council. In practice this change was merely symbolic.
* Amendment No. 21 (2 November 1933): Removed provisions granting the Governor General the right to veto bills or reserve them &quot;for the King&#x27;s pleasure&quot; by referring them to London.
* Amendment No. 22 (16 November 1933): Abolished the right of appeal to the Privy Council.
* Amendment No. 26 (5 April 1935): Made a technical change to Article 3, which dealt with citizenship.
* Amendment No. 23 (24 April 1936): Abolished the two university constituencies in the Dáil.
* Amendment No. 24 (29 May 1936): Abolished Seanad Éireann.
* Amendment No. 27 (11 December 1936): Abolished the office of Governor General and removed all reference to the King from the constitution. The functions of the Governor General were transferred to various other branches of government.

==Role of the Monarch==
As well as the constitutional changes above affecting the status of the British monarch, after the abdication of Edward VIII on 11 December 1936, the Executive Council proposed and passed the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 which reduced the role of the King to external functions only. It was followed the following year by the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937, which completed the process of removing the position of Governor-General from Irish law.

==Proposal of the Constitution of Ireland==

The Executive Council proposed a new Constitution of Ireland which passed final stages in the Dáil on 14 June 1937. In a plebiscite held on 1 July 1937, the same date as a general election, the Constitution was approved with the support of 56.5% of votes cast. It came into force on 29 December 1937.

<doc id="322895" wikidata="Q727316" url="?curid=322895" title="Renaud de Montauban">
<text>Renaud (or Renaut or Renault) de Montauban ( ; ; ; or ) was a legendary hero and knight which appeared in a 12th-century Old French known as &quot;The Four Sons of Aymon&quot;. The four sons of Duke Aymon are Renaud, Richard, Alard and Guiscard, and their cousin is the magician Maugris (; or ). Renaud possesses the magical horse Bayard and the sword Froberge (; or ).

The story of Renaud was popular across Europe. The tale was adapted into Dutch, German, Italian and English versions throughout the Middle Ages, inspired the Old Icelandic , and also incited subsequent sequels and related texts that form part of the Doon de Mayence cycle of &quot;chansons&quot;. Renaud, as Rinaldo, is an important character in Italian Renaissance epics, including &quot;Morgante&quot; by Luigi Pulci, by Matteo Maria Boiardo and by Ludovico Ariosto.

==Quatre Fils Aymon==
The oldest extant version of the anonymous Old French &quot;chanson de geste&quot; &quot;Quatre Fils Aymon&quot; dates from the late 12th century and comprises 18,489 (12 syllable) verses grouped in assonanced and rhymed laisses (the first 12,120 verses use assonance; critics suggest that the rhymed laisses derive from a different poet). It is one of the longest of all the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;. Other versions range from 14,300 to 28,000 verses. It was transformed into prose romances in the 14th and 15th centuries, and, judging from the number of editions, the prose &quot;Quatre Fils Aymon&quot; was the most popular romance of chivalry in the late 15th and first half of the 16th century in France. The tale was the basis of other medieval versions in Italian, German, Dutch and English.

The plot of the French &quot;chanson&quot; is as follows:
Renaud and his three brothers were sons of Aymon de Dordone. They flee from the court of Charlemagne after Renaud kills one of Charlemagne&#x27;s nephews (Bertolai) in a brawl. A long war follows, during which Renaud and his brothers remain faithful to the chivalrous code of honor despite their sufferings, until Charlemagne is prevailed on by his paladins to make terms.

The four brothers are pardoned on condition that Renaud go to the Holy Land on Crusade, and that their magical horse Bayard, who could expand his size to carry all four brothers on its back, be surrendered to Charlemagne. Charlemagne orders that the magic horse be drowned by chaining it to a stone and throwing it in a river, but the horse escapes and lives forever more in the woods. Renaud, after further adventures on the Crusades, returns home.

He eventually abandons his home and goes to Cologne, where he becomes a builder on a shrine to Saint Peter. In the end, he is murdered by resentful workers, but his body is miraculously saved from the river and makes its way magically in a cart back to his brothers.

Bulfinch relates that the cart magically moved to Dortmund, where Renaud is made patron saint of a new church, identifying him with Saint Reinold. 

Charlemagne is portrayed as vengeful and treacherous in these stories, and he is fooled by the sorcerer Maugris; the sympathy of the storyteller is clearly with the four brothers, but ultimately feudal authority is upheld.

==Renaud de Montauban cycle==


From the 13th century on, other texts concerning separate elements of the extended Renaud de Montauban story were created; together with the original &quot;Quatre Fils Aymon&quot;, these are termed the &quot;Renaud de Montauban cycle&quot;. These poems are: &quot;Maugis d&#x27;Aigremont&quot; (story of the youth of Maugis), &quot;Mort de Maugis&quot; (story of the death of Maugis), &quot;Vivien de Monbranc&quot; (story of the brother of Maugis), &quot;Bueve d&#x27;Aigremont&quot; (story of the father of Maugis, Bueve d&#x27;Aigremont, brother to Girart de Roussillon and Doon de Nanteuil).

===&quot;Maugis d&#x27;Aigremont&quot;===
&quot;Maugis d&#x27;Aigremont&quot; was a most likely composed in the early 13th century. It exists in a few extant versions; the latest version comprises 9,078 rhymed alexandrines. It tells of the youth of Maugris.

The story is, briefly, as follows: the twin sons of Beuve d&#x27;Aigremont are Maugis and Vivien. Taken away at birth, Maugis is raised by the fairy Oriande while Vivien is raised by Esclarmonde (wife of the Saracen Sorgalant, ruler of Monbranc). Maugis conquers the horse Bayard and gains the sword Froberge, participates in various battles, and kills Sorgolant. Discovering his identity, he battles to save his maternal grandfather (who is being attacked by Charlemagne) and his father (who is being assaulted by Vivien, who becomes the new ruler, or &quot;amachour&quot;, of Monbranc). Vivien then discovers his identity and converts to Christianity. At the end, Maugis gives Bayard and Froberge to his cousin Renaud.

===&quot;Mort de Maugis&quot;===
&quot;Mort de Maugis&quot; is a short work of 1,250 verses. It tells a different version of the death of Maugis than the one given in &quot;Quatre fils Aymon&quot; (in which he ends his days in a hermitage): Maugis becomes a senator at Rome.

===&quot;Vivien de Monbranc&quot;===
&quot;Vivien de Monbranc&quot; (or &quot;Vivien l&#x27;amachour de Monbranc&quot;) has come down to us in only one version, a short work of 1,100 alexandrine verses composed in the 13th century. It constitutes a continuation of &quot;Maugis d&#x27;Aigremont&quot;, and is most likely a shortened version of what was originally a longer work. It tells of how Vivien, after his conversion, was attacked by unbelievers and was aided by Maugis and his valet Fousifie.

===&quot;Bueve d&#x27;Aigremont&quot;===
This work from the third quarter of the 12th century, appears as a form of &quot;preface&quot; in a great number of manuscripts of &quot;Quatre fils Aymon&quot;. It tells of the story of the father of Maugris, Bueve d&#x27;Aigremont who becomes a rebellious vassal of Charlemagne. Bueve is aided by his brothers Girart de Roussillon and Doon de Nanteuil, but he dies.

==Rinaldo in &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;==
In Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, Rinaldo is the brother of Bradamante. Rinaldo and his cousin Orlando (Roland) both fall in love with the beautiful Angelica and a rivalry arises between them. Rinaldo drinks from a fountain which causes him to fall in love with Angelica while she drinks from another fountain which causes her to hate him (&quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; I: 78); this exactly reverses the situation in Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;. He is sent by Charlemagne to Britain where he recruits knights from Scotland and England to aid in the defense of France. He is finally cured of his love for Angelica when he drinks from another magic fountain (&quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; XLII: 63). He promises his sister Bradamante to the African knight Ruggiero.

==Rinaldo of &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;==

Renaud de Montauban should not be confused with Rinaldo, the son of Bertoldo and reputed founder of the House of Este in Torquato Tasso&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; (1580), though this second character is made out to be a descendant of the original paladin&#x27;s sister Bradamante. The second Rinaldo is the son of Bertoldo and Sophia and he lived during the time of the First Crusade. According to legend, Bertoldo is the son of Azzo II, a real person who was Count of Este (Orlando Furioso III: 29-30). One of Azzo II&#x27;s sons was Welf IV, (Welf I, Duke of Bavaria). &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; states that Bertoldo is related to Welf IV. (Jerusalem Delivered XVII: 81).

In &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; Rinaldo is the greatest of the Christian knights. Apart from various battles in the story, the witch Armida comes across him sleeping, and abducts him in her chariot (Canto 14). She intends to kill him but she falls in love with him instead and takes him away to a magical island where he becomes infatuated with her and forgets the crusade. Carlo and Ubaldo, two Christian knights and close companions of Rinaldo, seek out the hidden fortress, brave the dangers that guard it and find Rinaldo and Armida in each other&#x27;s arms. By giving Rinaldo a mirror of diamond, they force him to see himself in his effeminate and amorous state and to return to the war, leaving Armida heartbroken (Cantos 14-16).

Rinaldo is deposited on a shore where he finds a shield and sword, and the &quot;Mago d&#x27;Ascalona&quot; (&quot;Wizard of Ascalon&quot;) shows him a vision of the future in the shield, including the glories of the House of Este (Tasso drops in several prophecies of the time between 1099 and his own at various points). Rinaldo resolves to pursue the crusade with all his might (Canto 17). Armida is grief-stricken and raises an army to kill Rinaldo and fight the Christians, but her champions are all defeated. She attempts to commit suicide, but Rinaldo finds her in time and prevents her. Rinaldo then begs her to convert to Christianity, and Armida, her heart softened, consents (Canto 20).

==Renaud and Saint Reinold==

The manner of Renauld&#x27;s death appears to be identical in both method and location to the martyrdom of Saint Reinold at Cologne in 960. Continental sources, including guides to Dortmund where Reinold is patron saint of both town and cathedral, routinely equate Renaud with the martyred monk.

==Modern versions==
During the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, the story of &quot;Les Quatre Fils Aymon&quot; was made into a play that was banned by the German authorities, because of the sympathy it displayed for resisting authority; the play was performed underground and became quite popular.

Rinaldo (played by Leigh McCloskey) features in the 1983 Italian film &quot;I paladini - Storia d&#x27;armi e d&#x27;amori&quot; (aka &quot;Hearts and Armour&quot;).

==Ship name==

Four successive ships of the British Royal Navy were named HMS Rinaldo for this character.

<text>The 3rd executive council of the Irish Free State (23 June 1927 – 11 October 1927) was formed after the June 1927 general election to the 5th Dáil held on 9 June 1927. It was led by W. T. Cosgrave, leader of Cumann na nGaedheal, as President of the Executive Council, who had led the government since August 1922. It lasted .

==Nomination of President of the Executive Council==
The 5th Dáil first met on 23 June 1927. In the debate on the nomination of the President of the Executive Council, Cumann na nGaedheal leader and outgoing President W. T. Cosgrave was proposed, and this resolution was carried with 68 votes in favour and 22 against. Cosgrave was then appointed as President of the Executive Council by Governor-General Tim Healy.

==Members of the Executive Council==
The members of the Executive Council were nominated by the president and approved by the Dáil by a vote of 66 to 31. They were then appointed by the Governor General.

==Parliamentary secretaries==
The Executive Council appointed Parliamentary secretaries on the nomination of the President. The first three were appointed on 24 June 1927.
==Actions of the government==
After the assassination of Kevin O&#x27;Higgins on 10 July 1927, the Executive Council proposed the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill. This legislation provided for the disqualification for five years of any member of the Oireachtas who did not take the Oath of Allegiance prescribed in Article 17 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State. After this legislation had passed both houses, the TDs elected for Fianna Fáil led by Éamon de Valera took the oath and entered the Dáil for the first time since the 1922 general election.

==Confidence in the government==
On 16 August, Labour Party leader Thomas Johnson proposed a motion of no confidence in the Executive Council, which was defeated.

==Dissolution==
On 24 August, Cumann na nGaedheal won two by-elections, and sought to capitalise on this success by calling a new general election seeking an increased mandated. The president sought a dissolution of the Dáil and a new election was held in September 1927.

<doc id="322911" wikidata="Q191059" url="?curid=322911" title="Anguidae">
<text>Anguidae refers to a large and diverse family of lizards native to the Northern Hemisphere. It contains 9 genera and 89 extant species. Common characteristics of this group include a reduced supratemporal arch, striations on the medial faces of tooth crowns, osteoderms, and a lateral fold in the skin of most taxa. The group is divided into two living subfamilies, the legless Anguinae, which contains slow worms and glass lizards, among others, found across the Northern Hemisphere, and Gerrhonotinae, which contains the alligator lizards, native to North and Central America. The family Diploglossidae (which contains the galliwasps) was also formerly included.

== Morphology and reproduction ==

Anguids have hard osteoderms beneath their scales giving them an armored appearance. Members of the subfamily Anguinae have reduced or absent limbs, giving them a snake-like appearance, while members of Gerrohonotinae are fully limbed. Body type varies among species, with sizes ranging from 10 cm to 1.5 m. The group includes oviparous and viviparous species, both of which can be observed in a single genus at times.

== Feeding and habitat ==

Anguids are known carnivorous or insectivorous foragers, feeding primarily on insects, although larger species have been known to feed on small reptiles and amphibians. They inhabit a wide range of different habitats across the globe, from arid to tropical environments. Most known species are terrestrial or semifossorial, with the exception of one arboreal genus: &quot;Abronia&quot;.

== Evolution ==
Anguids have a relatively good fossil record and are relatively common as fossils in the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene of western North America. The oldest known anguid, with the most complete fossil record of any lizard, is &quot;Odaxosaurus&quot;, a member of the extinct anguid subfamily Glyptosaurinae, from the late Campanian of Canada, about 75 million years ago. &quot;Odaxosaurus&quot; and other Late Cretaceous anguids already exhibit many features found in living anguids, including chisel-like teeth and armor plates in the skin, suggesting a long evolutionary history for the group. Anguids were particularly diverse during the Paleocene and Eocene in North America; some species, such as those belonging to Glyptosaurinae, grew to large size and evolved a highly specialized crushing dentition. The long fossil record for the Anguidae in North America suggests that the group probably evolved in North America during the Cretaceous before dispersing to Europe in the Paleogene.
==Classification==
Family ANGUIDAE
* Subfamily Anguinae
** Genus &quot;Anguis&quot; - slowworms (5 species)
** Genus &quot;Dopasia&quot; - Asian glass lizards (7 species)
** Genus &quot;Hyalosaurus&quot; - North African glass lizard (1 species)
** Genus &quot;Ophisaurus&quot; - American glass lizards (13 species)
** Genus &quot;Pseudopus&quot; - scheltopusik (1* species)
* Subfamily Gerrhonotinae - alligator lizards
** Genus &quot;Barisia&quot; - alligator lizards (7 species)
** Genus &quot;Gerrhonotus&quot; - alligator lizards (9 species)
** Genus &quot;Abronia&quot; - arboreal alligator lizards (39 species)
** Genus &quot;Elgaria&quot; - western alligator lizards (7 species)
*Subfamily †Glyptosaurinae
Genetic evidence indicates that Diploglossinae lies outside the clade containing Anguinae, Gerrhonotinae, and the family Anniellidae, Therefore, it has been placed in own separate family Diploglossidae.

<text>In biochemistry, the native state of a protein or nucleic acid is its properly folded and/or assembled form, which is operative and functional. The native state of a biomolecule may possess all four levels of biomolecular structure, with the secondary through quaternary structure being formed from weak interactions along the covalently-bonded backbone. This is in contrast to the denatured state, in which these weak interactions are disrupted, leading to the loss of these forms of structure and retaining only the biomolecule&#x27;s primary structure.

==Biochemistry==
===Proteins===

While all protein molecules begin as simple unbranched chains of amino acids, once completed they assume highly specific three-dimensional shapes. That ultimate shape, known as tertiary structure, is the folded shape that possesses a minimum of free energy. It is a protein&#x27;s tertiary, folded structure that makes it capable of performing its biological function. In fact, shape changes in proteins are the primary cause of several neurodegenerative diseases, including those caused by prions and amyloid (i.e. mad cow disease, kuru, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease). 

Many enzymes and other non-structural proteins have more than one native state, and they operate or undergo regulation by transitioning between these states. However, &quot;native state&quot; is used almost exclusively in the singular, typically to distinguish properly folded proteins from denatured or unfolded ones. In other contexts, the folded shape of a protein is most often referred to as its native &quot;conformation&quot; or &quot;structure.&quot;

Folded and unfolded proteins are often easily distinguished by virtue of their water solubilities, as many proteins become insoluble on denaturation. Proteins in the native state will have defined secondary structure, which can be detected spectroscopically, by circular dichroism and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 

The native state of a protein can be distinguished from a molten globule, by among other things, distances measured by NMR. Amino acids widely separated in a protein&#x27;s sequence may touch or lie very close to one another within a stably folded protein. In a molten globule, on the other hand, their time-averaged distances are liable to be greater.

Learning &quot;how&quot; native state proteins can be manufactured is important, as attempts to create proteins from scratch have resulted in molten globules and not true native state products. Therefore, an understanding of the native state is crucial in protein engineering.

===Nucleic acids===
Nucleic acids attain their native state through base pairing and, to a lesser extent, other interactions such as coaxial stacking. Biological DNA usually exists as long linear double helices bound to proteins in chromatin, and biological RNA such as tRNA often form complex native configurations approaching the complexity of folded proteins. Additionally, artificial nucleic acid structures used in DNA nanotechnology are designed to have specific native configurations in which multiple nucleic acid strands are assembled into a single complex.
In some cases native state of biological DNA performs their functions without being controlled by any other regulatory units.

<text>The Italian Renaissance ( ) was a period in Italian history between the 14th and 16th centuries. The period is known for the initial development of the broader Renaissance culture that spread across Western Europe and marked the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity. Proponents of a &quot;long Renaissance&quot; argue that it started around the year 1300 and lasted until about 1600. In some fields, a Proto-Renaissance, beginning around 1250, is typically accepted. The French word &quot;renaissance&quot; (corresponding to &quot;rinascimento&quot; in Italian) means &quot;rebirth&quot;, and defines the period as one of cultural revival and renewed interest in classical antiquity after the centuries during what Renaissance humanists labelled as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. The Italian Renaissance historian Giorgio Vasari used the term &quot;rinascita&quot; (&quot;rebirth&quot;) in his &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot; in 1550, but the concept became widespread only in the 19th century, after the work of scholars such as Jules Michelet and Jacob Burckhardt.

The Renaissance began in Tuscany in Central Italy and centred in the city of Florence. The Florentine Republic, one of the several city-states of the peninsula, rose to economic and political prominence by providing credit for European monarchs and by laying down the groundwork for developments in capitalism and in banking. Renaissance culture later spread to Venice, the heart of a Mediterranean empire and in control of the trade routes with the east since its participation in the Crusades and following the journeys of Marco Polo between 1271 and 1295. Thus Italy renewed contact with the remains of ancient Greek culture, which provided humanist scholars with new texts. Finally the Renaissance had a significant effect on the Papal States and on Rome, largely rebuilt by humanist and Renaissance popes, such as Julius II and Leo X, who frequently became involved in Italian politics, in arbitrating disputes between competing colonial powers and in opposing the Protestant Reformation, which started .

The Italian Renaissance has a reputation for its achievements in painting, architecture, sculpture, literature, music, philosophy, science, technology, and exploration. Italy became the recognized European leader in all these areas by the late 15th century, during the era of the Peace of Lodi (1454–1494) agreed between Italian states. The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as domestic disputes and foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the Italian Wars (1494–1559). However, the ideas and ideals of the Italian Renaissance spread into the rest of Europe, setting off the Northern Renaissance from the late 15th century. Italian explorers from the maritime republics served under the auspices of European monarchs, ushering in the Age of Discovery. The most famous voyage was that of Christopher Columbus (who sailed for Spain) and laid the foundation for European dominance of the Americas. Other explorers include Giovanni da Verrazzano (for France), Amerigo Vespucci (for Spain), and John Cabot (for England). Italian scientists such as Falloppio, Tartaglia, Galileo and Torricelli played key roles in the Scientific Revolution, and foreigners such as Copernicus and Vesalius worked in Italian universities. Historiographers have proposed various events and dates of the 17th century, such as the conclusion of the European wars of religion in 1648, as marking the end of the Renaissance.

Accounts of proto-Renaissance literature usually begin with the three great Italian writers of the 14th century: Dante Alighieri (&quot;Divine Comedy&quot;), Petrarch (&quot;Canzoniere&quot;), and Boccaccio (&quot;Decameron&quot;). Famous vernacular poets of the Renaissance include the epic authors Luigi Pulci (&quot;Morgante&quot;), Matteo Maria Boiardo (&quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;), Ludovico Ariosto (&quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;), and Torquato Tasso (&quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;). 15th-century writers such as the poet Poliziano and the Platonist philosopher Marsilio Ficino made extensive translations from both Latin and Greek. In the early 16th century, Baldassare Castiglione laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady in &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot;, while Niccolò Machiavelli rejected the ideal with an eye on &quot;la verità effettuale della cosa&quot; (&#x27;the effectual truth of things&#x27;) in &quot;The Prince&quot;, composed, in humanistic style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of virtù. Historians of the period include Machiavelli himself, his friend and critic Francesco Guicciardini and Giovanni Botero (&quot;The Reason of State&quot;). The Aldine Press, founded in 1494 by the printer Aldo Manuzio, active in Venice, developed Italic type and pocket editions that one could carry in one&#x27;s pocket; it became the first to publish printed editions of books in Ancient Greek. Venice also became the birthplace of the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;.

Italian Renaissance art exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Donatello, Giotto, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Piero della Francesca, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, and Titian. Italian Renaissance architecture had a similar Europe-wide impact, as practised by Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, and Bramante. Their works include the Florence Cathedral, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, and the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, as well as several private residences. The musical era of the Italian Renaissance featured composers such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, the Roman School and later the Venetian School, and the birth of opera through figures like Claudio Monteverdi in Florence. In philosophy, thinkers such as Galileo, Machiavelli, Giordano Bruno and Pico della Mirandola emphasized naturalism and humanism, thus rejecting dogma and scholasticism.

==Origins and background==
===Northern and Central Italy in the Late Middle Ages===
By the Late Middle Ages (), Latium, the former heartland of the Roman Empire, and southern Italy were generally poorer than the North. Rome was a city of ancient ruins, and the Papal States were loosely administered, and vulnerable to external interference, particularly by France, and later Spain. The Papacy was affronted when the Avignon Papacy was created in southern France as a consequence of pressure from King Philip the Fair of France. In the south, Sicily had for some time been under foreign domination, by the Arabs and then the Normans. Sicily had prospered for 150 years during the Emirate of Sicily and later for two centuries during the Norman Kingdom and the Hohenstaufen Kingdom, but had declined by the Late Middle Ages.

In contrast, Northern and Central Italy had become far more prosperous, and it has been calculated that the region was among the richest in Europe. The Crusades had built trade links to the Levant, and the Fourth Crusade had done much to destroy the Byzantine Empire as a commercial rival to the Venetians and the Genoese. The main trade routes from the east passed through the Byzantine Empire or the Arab lands and onward to the ports of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. Luxury goods bought in the Levant, such as spices, dyes, and silks were imported to Italy and then resold throughout Europe. Moreover, the inland city-states profited from the rich agricultural land of the Po Valley. From France, Germany, and the Low Countries, through the medium of the Champagne fairs, land and river trade routes brought goods such as wool, wheat, and precious metals into the region. The extensive trade that stretched from Egypt to the Baltic generated substantial surpluses that allowed significant investment in mining and agriculture. By the 14th century, the city of Venice had become an emporium for lands as far as Cyprus; it boasted a naval fleet of over 5000 ships thanks to its arsenal, a vast complex of shipyards that was the first European facility to mass-produce commercial and military vessels. Genoa also had become a maritime power. Thus, while northern Italy was not richer in resources than many other parts of Europe, the level of development, stimulated by trade, allowed it to prosper. In particular, Florence became one of the wealthiest of the cities of Northern Italy, mainly due to its woollen textile production, developed under the supervision of its dominant trade guild, the &quot;Arte della Lana&quot;. Wool was imported from Northern Europe (and in the 16th century from Spain) and together with dyes from the east were used to make high-quality textiles.

The Italian trade routes that covered the Mediterranean and beyond were also major conduits of culture and knowledge. The recovery of lost Greek classics brought to Italy by refugee Byzantine scholars who migrated during and following the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in the 15th century were important in sparking the new linguistic studies of the Renaissance, in newly created academies in Florence and Venice. Humanist scholars searched monastic libraries for ancient manuscripts and recovered Tacitus and other Latin authors. The rediscovery of Vitruvius meant that the architectural principles of Antiquity could be observed once more, and Renaissance artists were encouraged, in the atmosphere of humanist optimism, to excel in the achievements of the Ancients, like Apelles, of whom they read.

=== Religious background ===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD, the Catholic Church filled the subsequent vacuum. In the Middle Ages, the Church was considered to be conveying the will of God, and it regulated the standard of behaviour in life. A lack of literacy required most people to rely on the priest&#x27;s explanation of the Bible and laws.

In the eleventh century, the Church persecuted many groups including pagans, Jews, and lepers in order to eliminate irregularities in society and strengthen its power. In response to the laity&#x27;s challenge to Church authority, bishops played an important role, as they gradually lost control of secular authority, and to regain the power of discourse, they adopted extreme control methods, such as persecuting infidels.

The Church also collected wealth from believers in the Middle Ages, such as through the sale of indulgences. It also did not pay taxes, making the Church&#x27;s wealth even more than some kings.

===Thirteenth century===
In the 13th century, much of Europe experienced strong economic growth. The trade routes of the Italian states linked with those of established Mediterranean ports and eventually the Hanseatic League of the Baltic and northern regions of Europe to create a network economy in Europe for the first time since the 4th century. The city-states of Italy expanded greatly during this period and grew in power to become de facto fully independent of the Holy Roman Empire; apart from the Kingdom of Naples, outside powers kept their armies out of Italy. During this period, the modern commercial infrastructure developed, with double-entry book-keeping, joint stock companies, an international banking system, a systematized foreign exchange market, insurance, and government debt. Florence became the centre of this financial industry and the gold florin became the main currency of international trade.

The new mercantile governing class, who gained their position through financial skill, adapted to their purposes the feudal aristocratic model that had dominated Europe in the Middle Ages. A feature of the High Middle Ages in Northern Italy was the rise of the urban communes which had broken from the control by bishops and local counts. In much of the region, the landed nobility was poorer than the urban patriarchs in the high medieval money economy whose inflationary rise left land-holding aristocrats impoverished. The increase in trade during the early Renaissance enhanced these characteristics. The decline of feudalism and the rise of cities influenced each other; for example, the demand for luxury goods led to an increase in trade, which led to greater numbers of tradesmen becoming wealthy, who, in turn, demanded more luxury goods. This atmosphere of assumed luxury of the time created a need for the creation of visual symbols of wealth, an important way to show a family&#x27;s affluence and taste.

This change also gave the merchants almost complete control of the governments of the Italian city-states, again enhancing trade. One of the most important effects of this political control was security. Those who grew extremely wealthy in a feudal state ran the constant risk of running afoul of the monarchy and having their lands confiscated, as famously occurred to Jacques Cœur in France. The northern states also kept many medieval laws that severely hampered commerce, such as those against usury, and prohibitions on trading with non-Christians. In the city-states of Italy, these laws were repealed or rewritten.

===Fourteenth-century collapse===
The 14th century saw a series of catastrophes that caused the European economy to go into recession. The Medieval Warm Period was ending as the transition to the Little Ice Age began. This climate change saw agricultural output decline significantly, leading to repeated famines, exacerbated by the rapid population growth of the earlier era. The Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France disrupted trade throughout northwest Europe, most notably when, in 1345, King Edward III of England repudiated his debts, contributing to the collapse of the two largest Florentine banks, those of the Bardi and Peruzzi. In the east, war was also disrupting trade routes, as the Ottoman Empire began to expand throughout the region. Most devastating, though, was the Black Death that decimated the populations of the densely populated cities of Northern Italy and returned at intervals thereafter. Florence, for instance, which had a pre-plague population of 45,000 decreased over the next 47 years by 25–50%. Widespread disorder followed, including a revolt of Florentine textile workers, the &quot;ciompi&quot;, in 1378.
It was during this period of instability that authors such as Dante and Petrarch lived, and the first stirrings of Renaissance art were to be seen, notably in the realism of Giotto. Paradoxically, some of these disasters would help establish the Renaissance. The Black Death wiped out a third of Europe&#x27;s population. The resulting labour shortage increased wages and the reduced population was therefore much wealthier, better fed, and, significantly, had more surplus money to spend on luxury goods. As incidences of the plague began to decline in the early 15th century, Europe&#x27;s devastated population once again began to grow. The new demand for products and services also helped create a growing class of bankers, merchants, and skilled artisans. The horrors of the Black Death and the seeming inability of the Church to provide relief would contribute to a decline of church influence. Additionally, the collapse of the Bardi and Peruzzi banks would open the way for the Medici to rise to prominence in Florence. Roberto Sabatino Lopez argues that the economic collapse was a crucial cause of the Renaissance. According to this view, in a more prosperous era, businessmen would have quickly reinvested their earnings in order to make more money in a climate favourable to investment. However, in the leaner years of the 14th century, the wealthy found few promising investment opportunities for their earnings and instead chose to spend more on culture and art.

Unlike Roman texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Italy. Ancient Greek works on science, maths and philosophy had been studied since the High Middle Ages in Western Europe and in the Islamic Golden Age (normally in translation), but Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the Greek dramatists, Demosthenes and Thucydides) were not studied in either the Latin or medieval Muslim worlds; in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. Some argue that the Timurid Renaissance in Samarkand was linked with the Ottoman Empire, whose conquests led to the migration of Greek scholars to Italy. One of the greatest achievements of Italian Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since late antiquity.

Another popular explanation for the Italian Renaissance is the thesis, first advanced by historian Hans Baron, that states that the primary impetus of the early Renaissance was the long-running series of wars between Florence and Milan. By the late 14th century, Milan had become a centralized monarchy under the control of the Visconti family. Giangaleazzo Visconti, who ruled the city from 1378 to 1402, was renowned both for his cruelty and for his abilities, and set about building an empire in Northern Italy. He launched a long series of wars, with Milan steadily conquering neighbouring states and defeating the various coalitions led by Florence that sought in vain to halt the advance. This culminated in the 1402 siege of Florence when it looked as though the city was doomed to fall, before Giangaleazzo suddenly died and his empire collapsed.

Baron&#x27;s thesis suggests that during these long wars, the leading figures of Florence rallied the people by presenting the war as one between the free republic and a despotic monarchy, between the ideals of the Greek and Roman Republics and those of the Roman Empire and medieval kingdoms. For Baron, the most important figure in crafting this ideology was Leonardo Bruni. This time of crisis in Florence was the period when the most influential figures of the early Renaissance were coming of age, such as Ghiberti, Donatello, Masolino, and Brunelleschi. Inculcated with this republican ideology they later went on to advocate republican ideas that were to have an enormous impact on the Renaissance.

==Development==

===International relationships===
Northern Italy and upper Central Italy were divided into a number of warring city-states, the most powerful being Milan, Florence, Pisa, Siena, Genoa, Ferrara, Mantua, Verona and Venice. High Medieval Northern Italy was further divided by the long-running battle for supremacy between the forces of the Papacy and of the Holy Roman Empire: each city aligned itself with one faction or the other, yet was divided internally between the two warring parties, Guelfs and Ghibellines. Warfare between the states was common, and invasion from outside Italy was confined to intermittent sorties of Holy Roman Emperors. Renaissance politics developed from this background. Since the 13th century, as armies became primarily composed of mercenaries, prosperous city-states could field considerable forces, despite their low populations. In the course of the 15th century, the most powerful city-states annexed their smaller neighbours. Florence took Pisa in 1406, Venice captured Padua and Verona, while the Duchy of Milan annexed a number of nearby areas including Pavia and Parma.

The first part of the Renaissance saw almost constant warfare on land and sea as the city-states vied for preeminence. On land, these wars were primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as &quot;condottieri&quot;, bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, but especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains. The mercenaries were not willing to risk their lives unduly, and war became one largely of sieges and manoeuvring, occasioning few pitched battles. It was also in the interest of mercenaries on both sides to prolong any conflict, to continue their employment. Mercenaries were also a constant threat to their employers; if not paid, they often turned on their patron. If it became obvious that a state was entirely dependent on mercenaries, the temptation was great for the mercenaries to take over the running of it themselves—this occurred on a number of occasions. Neutrality was maintained with France, which found itself surrounded by enemies when Spain disputed Charles VIII&#x27;s claim to the Kingdom of Naples. Peace with France ended when Charles VIII invaded Italy to take Naples.

At sea, Italian city-states sent many fleets out to do battle. The main contenders were Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, but after a long conflict, the Genoese succeeded in reducing Pisa. Venice proved to be a more powerful adversary, and with the decline of Genoese power during the 15th century Venice became pre-eminent on the seas. In response to threats from the landward side, from the early 15th century Venice developed an increased interest in controlling the &quot;terrafirma&quot; as the Venetian Renaissance opened.

On land, decades of fighting saw Florence, Milan, and Venice emerge as the dominant players, and these three powers finally set aside their differences and agreed to the Peace of Lodi in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries. This peace would hold for the next forty years, and Venice&#x27;s unquestioned hegemony over the sea also led to unprecedented peace for much of the rest of the 15th century. At the beginning of the 15th century, adventurers and traders such as Niccolò Da Conti (1395–1469) travelled as far as Southeast Asia and back, bringing fresh knowledge on the state of the world, presaging further European voyages of exploration in the years to come.

===Florence under the Medici===

Until the late 14th century, prior to the Medici, Florence&#x27;s leading family were the House of Albizzi. In 1293 the Ordinances of Justice were enacted which effectively became the constitution of the Republic of Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance. The city&#x27;s numerous luxurious palazzi were becoming surrounded by townhouses, built by the ever prospering merchant class. In 1298, one of the leading banking families of Europe, the Bonsignoris, were bankrupted and so the city of Siena lost her status as the banking centre of Europe to Florence.
The main challengers of the Albizzi family were the Medicis, first under Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, and later under his son Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. The Medici controlled the Medici bank—then Europe&#x27;s largest bank—and an array of other enterprises in Florence and elsewhere. In 1433, the Albizzi managed to have Cosimo exiled. The next year, however, saw a pro-Medici Signoria elected and Cosimo returned. The Medici became the town&#x27;s leading family, a position they would hold for the next three centuries. Florence organized the trade routes for commodities between England and the Netherlands, France, and Italy. By the middle of the century, the city had become the banking capital of Europe and thereby obtained vast riches. In 1439, Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos attended a council in Florence in an attempt to unify the Eastern and Western Churches. This brought books and, especially after the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, an influx of scholars to the city. Ancient Greece began to be studied with renewed interest, especially the Neoplatonic school of thought, which was the subject of an academy established by the Medici.

Florence remained a republic until 1532 (see Duchy of Florence), traditionally marking the end of the High Renaissance in Florence, but the instruments of republican government were firmly under the control of the Medici and their allies, save during the intervals after 1494 and 1527. Cosimo and Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici rarely held official posts but were the unquestioned leaders. Cosimo was highly popular among the citizenry, mainly for bringing an era of stability and prosperity to the town. One of his most important accomplishments was negotiating the Peace of Lodi with Francesco Sforza ending the decades of war with Milan and bringing stability to much of Northern Italy. Cosimo was also an important patron of the arts, directly and indirectly, by the influential example he set.

Cosimo was succeeded by his sickly son Piero de&#x27; Medici, who died after five years in charge of the city. In 1469 the reins of power passed to Cosimo&#x27;s 21-year-old grandson Lorenzo, who would become known as &quot;Lorenzo the Magnificent.&quot; Lorenzo was the first of the family to be educated from an early age in the humanist tradition and is best known as one of the Renaissance&#x27;s most important patrons of the arts. Lorenzo reformed Florence&#x27;s ruling council from 100 members to 70, formalizing the Medici rule. The republican institutions continued, but they lost all power. Lorenzo was less successful than his illustrious forebears in business, and the Medici commercial empire was slowly eroded. Lorenzo continued the alliance with Milan, but relations with the papacy soured, and in 1478, Papal agents allied with the Pazzi family in an attempt to assassinate Lorenzo. Although the Pazzi conspiracy failed, Lorenzo&#x27;s young brother, Giuliano, was killed at Easter Sunday mass in the city&#x27;s cathedral. The failed assassination led to a war with the Papacy and was used as justification to further centralize power in Lorenzo&#x27;s hands.

===Spread===

Renaissance ideals first spread from Florence to the neighbouring states of Tuscany such as Siena and Lucca. The Tuscan culture soon became the model for all the states of Northern Italy, and the Tuscan dialect came to predominate throughout the region, especially in literature. In 1447 Francesco Sforza came to power in Milan and rapidly transformed that still medieval city into a major centre of art and learning that drew Leone Battista Alberti. Venice, one of the wealthiest cities due to its control of the Adriatic Sea, also became a centre for Renaissance culture, especially Venetian Renaissance architecture. Smaller courts brought Renaissance patronage to lesser cities, which developed their characteristic arts: Ferrara, Mantua under the Gonzaga, and Urbino under Federico da Montefeltro. In Naples, the Renaissance was ushered in under the patronage of Alfonso I, who conquered Naples in 1443 and encouraged artists like Francesco Laurana and Antonello da Messina and writers like the poet Jacopo Sannazaro and the humanist scholar Angelo Poliziano.

In 1417 the Papacy returned to Rome, but that once-imperial city remained poor and largely in ruins through the first years of the Renaissance. The great transformation began under Pope Nicholas V, who became pontiff in 1447. He launched a dramatic rebuilding effort that would eventually see much of the city renewed. The humanist scholar Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini became Pope Pius II in 1458. As the papacy fell under the control of wealthy families, such as the Medici and the Borgias, the spirit of Renaissance art and philosophy came to dominate the Vatican. Pope Sixtus IV continued Nicholas&#x27; work, most famously ordering the construction of the Sistine Chapel. The popes also became increasingly secular rulers as the Papal States were forged into a centralized power by a series of &quot;warrior popes&quot;.

The nature of the Renaissance also changed in the late 15th century. The Renaissance ideal was fully adopted by the ruling classes and the aristocracy. In the early Renaissance artists were seen as craftsmen with little prestige or recognition. By the later Renaissance, the top figures wielded great influence and could charge great fees. A flourishing trade in Renaissance art developed. While in the early Renaissance many of the leading artists were of lower- or middle-class origins, increasingly they became aristocrats.

===Wider population===
As a cultural movement, the Italian Renaissance affected only a small part of the population. Italy was the most urbanized region of Europe, but three-quarters of the people were still rural peasants. For this section of the population, life remained essentially unchanged from the Middle Ages. Classic feudalism had never been prominent in Northern Italy, and most peasants worked on private farms or as sharecroppers. Some scholars see a trend towards refeudalization in the later Renaissance as the urban elites turned themselves into landed aristocrats.

The situation differed in the cities. These were dominated by a commercial elite; as exclusive as the aristocracy of any medieval kingdom. This group became the main patrons of and audience for Renaissance culture. Below them, there was a large class of artisans and guild members who lived comfortable lives and had significant power in the republican governments. This was in sharp contrast to the rest of Europe where artisans were firmly in the lower class. Literate and educated, this group participated in the Renaissance culture. The largest section of the urban population was the urban poor of semi-skilled workers and the unemployed. Like the peasants, the Renaissance had little effect on them. Historians debate how easy it was to move between these groups during the Italian Renaissance. Examples of individuals who rose from humble beginnings can be instanced, but Burke notes two major studies in this area that have found that the data do not clearly demonstrate an increase in social mobility. Most historians feel that early in the Renaissance social mobility was quite high, but that it faded over the course of the 15th century. Inequality in society was very high. An upper-class figure would control hundreds of times more income than a servant or labourer. Some historians see this unequal distribution of wealth as important to the Renaissance, as art patronage relies on the very wealthy.

The Renaissance was not a period of great social or economic change, only of cultural and ideological development. It only touched a small fraction of the population, and in modern times this has led many historians, such as any that follow historical materialism, to reduce the importance of the Renaissance in human history. These historians tend to think in terms of &quot;Early Modern Europe&quot; instead. Roger Osborne argues that &quot;The Renaissance is a difficult concept for historians because the history of Europe quite suddenly turns into a history of Italian painting, sculpture and architecture.&quot;

===The waning of the Renaissance in Italy===
The end of the Italian Renaissance is as imprecisely marked as its starting point. For many, the rise to power in Florence of the austere monk Girolamo Savonarola in 1494–1498 marks the end of the city&#x27;s flourishing; for others, the triumphant return of the Medici family to power in 1512 marks the beginning of the late phase in the Renaissance arts called Mannerism. Other accounts trace the end of the Italian Renaissance to the French invasions of the early 16th century and the subsequent conflict between France and Spanish rulers for control of Italian territory. Savonarola rode to power on a widespread backlash over the secularism and indulgence of the Renaissance. His brief rule saw many works of art destroyed in the &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; in the centre of Florence. With the Medici returned to power, now as Grand Dukes of Tuscany, the counter-movement in the church continued. In 1542 the Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition was formed and a few years later the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; banned a wide array of Renaissance works of literature, which marks the end of the illuminated manuscript together with Giulio Clovio, who is considered the greatest illuminator of the Italian High Renaissance, and arguably the last very notable artist in the long tradition of the illuminated manuscript, before some modern revivals.

Under the suppression of the Catholic Church and the ravages of war, humanism became &quot;akin to heresy&quot;.

Equally important was the end of stability with a series of foreign invasions of Italy known as the Italian Wars that would continue for several decades. These began with the 1494 invasion by France that wreaked widespread devastation on Northern Italy and ended the independence of many of the city-states. Most damaging was the 6 May 1527, Spanish and German troops&#x27; sacking Rome that for two decades all but ended the role of the Papacy as the largest patron of Renaissance art and architecture.

While the Italian Renaissance was fading, the Northern Renaissance adopted many of its ideals and transformed its styles. A number of Italy&#x27;s greatest artists chose to emigrate. The most notable example was Leonardo da Vinci, who left for France in 1516, but teams of lesser artists invited to transform the Château de Fontainebleau created the School of Fontainebleau that infused the style of the Italian Renaissance in France. From Fontainebleau, the new styles, transformed by Mannerism, brought the Renaissance to the Low Countries and thence throughout Northern Europe.

This spread north was also representative of a larger trend. No longer was the Mediterranean Europe&#x27;s most important trade route. In 1498, Vasco da Gama reached India, and from that date the primary route of goods from the Orient was through the Atlantic ports of Lisbon, Seville, Nantes, Bristol, and London.

==Culture==

===Literature and poetry===

The thirteenth-century Italian literary revolution helped set the stage for the Renaissance. Before the Renaissance, the Italian language was not the literary language in Italy. It was only in the 13th century that Italian authors began writing in their native language rather than Latin, French, or Provençal. The 1250s saw a major change in Italian poetry as the &quot;Dolce Stil Novo&quot; (&quot;Sweet New Style&quot;, which emphasized Platonic rather than courtly love) came into its own, pioneered by poets like Guittone d&#x27;Arezzo and Guido Guinizelli. Especially in poetry, major changes in Italian literature had been taking place decades before the Renaissance truly began.

With the printing of books initiated in Venice by Aldus Manutius, an increasing number of works began to be published in the Italian language in addition to the flood of Latin and Greek texts that constituted the mainstream of the Italian Renaissance. The source for these works expanded beyond works of theology and towards the pre-Christian eras of Imperial Rome and Ancient Greece. This is not to say that no religious works were published in this period: Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; reflects a distinctly medieval world view. Christianity remained a major influence for artists and authors, with the classics coming into their own as a second primary influence.

In the early Italian Renaissance, much of the focus was on translating and studying classic works from Latin and Greek. Renaissance authors were not content to rest on the laurels of ancient authors, however. Many authors attempted to integrate the methods and styles of the ancient Greeks into their own works. Among the most emulated Romans are Cicero, Horace, Sallust, and Virgil. Among the Greeks, Aristotle, Homer, and Plato were now being read in the original for the first time since the 4th century, though Greek compositions were few.

The literature and poetry of the Renaissance were largely influenced by the developing science and philosophy. The humanist Francesco Petrarch, a key figure in the renewed sense of scholarship, was also an accomplished poet, publishing several important works of poetry. He wrote poetry in Latin, notably the Punic War epic &quot;Africa&quot;, but is today remembered for his works in the Italian vernacular, especially the &quot;Canzoniere&quot;, a collection of love sonnets dedicated to his unrequited love Laura. He was the foremost writer of Petrarchan sonnets, and translations of his work into English by Thomas Wyatt established the sonnet form in that country, where it was employed by William Shakespeare and countless other poets.

Petrarch&#x27;s disciple, Giovanni Boccaccio, became a major author in his own right. His major work was the &quot;Decameron&quot;, a collection of 100 stories told by ten storytellers who have fled to the outskirts of Florence to escape the black plague over ten nights. The &quot;Decameron&quot; in particular and Boccaccio&#x27;s work, in general, were a major source of inspiration and plots for many English authors in the Renaissance, including Geoffrey Chaucer and William Shakespeare.

Aside from Christianity, classical antiquity, and scholarship, a fourth influence on Renaissance literature was politics. The political philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s most famous works are &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;, &quot;Florentine Histories&quot; and finally &quot;The Prince&quot;, which has become so well known in modern societies that the word &quot;Machiavellian&quot; has come to refer to the cunning and ruthless actions advocated by the book. Along with many other Renaissance works, &quot;The Prince&quot; remains a relevant and influential work of literature today.

Many Italian Renaissance humanists also praised and affirmed the beauty of the body in poetry and literature. In Baldassare Rasinus&#x27;s panegyric for Francesco Sforza, Rasinus considered that beautiful people usually have virtue. In northern Italy, humanists had discussions about the connection between physical beauty and inner virtues. In Renaissance Italy, virtue and beauty were often linked together to praise men.

===Philosophy===
One role of Petrarch is as the founder of a new method of scholarship, Renaissance humanism.

Petrarch encouraged the study of the Latin classics and carried his copy of Homer about, at a loss to find someone to teach him to read Greek. An essential step in the classic humanist education being propounded by scholars like Pico della Mirandola was the hunting down of lost or forgotten manuscripts that were known only by reputation. These endeavours were greatly aided by the wealth of Italian patricians, merchant-princes and despots, who would spend substantial sums building libraries. Discovering the past had become fashionable and it was a passionate affair pervading the upper reaches of society. &quot;I go&quot;, said Cyriac of Ancona, &quot;I go to awake the dead&quot;. As the Greek works were acquired, manuscripts found, libraries and museums formed, the age of the printing press was dawning. The works of Antiquity were translated from Greek and Latin into the contemporary modern languages throughout Europe, finding a receptive middle-class audience, which might be, like Shakespeare, &quot;with little Latin and less Greek&quot;.

While concern for philosophy, art, and literature all increased greatly in the Renaissance, the period is usually seen as one of scientific backwardness. The reverence for classical sources further enshrined the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views of the universe. Humanism stressed that nature came to be viewed as an animate spiritual creation that was not governed by laws or mathematics. At the same time, philosophy lost much of its rigour as the rules of logic and deduction were seen as secondary to intuition and emotion.

===Science and technology===

During the Renaissance, great advances occurred in geography, astronomy, chemistry, physics, mathematics, manufacturing, anatomy and engineering. The collection of ancient scientific texts began in earnest at the start of the 15th century and continued up to the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, and the invention of printing democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of new ideas. Although humanists often favoured human-centred subjects like politics and history over study of natural philosophy or applied mathematics, many others went beyond these interests and had a positive influence on mathematics and science by rediscovering lost or obscure texts and by emphasizing the study of original languages and the correct reading of texts.

Italian universities such as Padua, Bologna and Pisa were scientific centres of renown and with many northern European students, the science of the Renaissance spread to Northern Europe and flourished there as well. Figures such as Copernicus, Francis Bacon, Descartes, and Galileo made contributions to scientific thought and experimentation, paving the way for the scientific revolution that later flourished in Northern Europe. Bodies were also stolen from gallows and examined by many like Andreas Vesalius, a professor of anatomy. This allowed him to create more accurate skeleton models by making more than 200 corrections to the works of Galen who dissected animals.

==== Mathematics ====
Major developments in mathematics include the spread of algebra throughout Europe, especially Italy. Luca Pacioli published a book on mathematics at the end of the fifteenth century, in which he first published positive and negative signs. Basic mathematical symbols were introduced by Simon Stevin in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Symbolic algebra was established by the French mathematician François Viete in the 16th century. He published &quot;Introduction to Analytical Methods&quot; in 1591, systematically sorting out algebra, and for the first time consciously using letters to represent unknown and known numbers. In his other book &quot;On the Recognition and Correction of Equations&quot;, Viete improved the solution of the third-degree and fourth-degree equations, and also established the relationship between the roots and coefficients of quadratic and cubic equations, which is called &quot;Viete&#x27;s formulas&quot; now. Trigonometry also achieved greater development during the Renaissance. The German mathematician Regiomontanus&#x27;s &quot;On Triangles of All Kinds&quot; was Europe&#x27;s first trigonometric work independent of astronomy. The book systematically elaborated plane triangles and spherical triangles, as well as a very precise table of trigonometric functions.

===Painting and sculpture===
In painting, the late medieval painter Giotto di Bondone, or Giotto, helped shape the artistic concepts that later defined much of the Renaissance art. The key ideas that he explored – classicism, the illusion of three-dimensional space and a realistic emotional context – inspired other artists such as Masaccio, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. He was not the only medieval artist to develop these ideas, however; the artists Pietro Cavallini and Cimabue both influenced Giotto&#x27;s use of statuesque figures and expressive storylines.

The frescos of Florentine artist Masaccio are generally considered to be among the earliest examples of Italian Renaissance art. Masaccio incorporated the ideas of Giotto, Donatello and Brunelleschi into his paintings, creating mathematically precise scenes that give the impression of three-dimensional space. The &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; fresco in the Florentine church of Santa Maria Novella, for example, looks as if it is receding at a dramatic angle into the dark background, while single-source lighting and foreshortening appear to push the figure of Christ into the viewer&#x27;s space.

While mathematical precision and classical idealism fascinated painters in Rome and Florence, many Northern artists in the regions of Venice, Milan and Parma preferred highly illusionistic scenes of the natural world. The period also saw the first secular (non-religious) themes. There has been much debate as to the degree of secularism in the Renaissance, which had been emphasized by early 20th-century writers like Jacob Burckhardt based on, among other things, the presence of a relatively small number of mythological paintings. Those of Botticelli, notably &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; and &quot;Primavera&quot;, are now among the best known, although he was deeply religious (becoming a follower of Savonarola) and the great majority of his output was of traditional religious paintings or portraits.
In sculpture, the Florentine artist Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi, or Donatello, was among the earliest sculptors to translate classical references into marble and bronze. His second sculpture of &quot;David&quot; was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire.

The period known as the High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective, the realistic depiction of both physical and psychological features, and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, &quot;sfumato&quot; (softening the transition between colours) and &quot;chiaroscuro&quot; (contrast between light and dark), in a single unifying style which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony. In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to the whole. The most famous painters from this phase are Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo and their images, including Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The School of Athens&quot; and Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Sistine Chapel Ceiling&quot; are the masterpieces of the period and among the most widely known works of art in the world.

High Renaissance painting evolved into Mannerism, especially in Florence. Mannerist artists, who consciously rebelled against the principles of High Renaissance, tend to represent elongated figures in illogical spaces. Modern scholarship has recognized the capacity of Mannerist art to convey strong (often religious) emotion where the High Renaissance failed to do so. Some of the main artists of this period are Pontormo, Bronzino, Rosso Fiorentino, Parmigianino and Raphael&#x27;s pupil Giulio Romano.

===Architecture===

In Florence, the Renaissance style was introduced with a revolutionary but incomplete monument by Leone Battista Alberti. Some of the earliest buildings showing Renaissance characteristics are Filippo Brunelleschi&#x27;s church of San Lorenzo and the Pazzi Chapel. The interior of &quot;Santo Spirito&quot; expresses a new sense of light, clarity and spaciousness, which is typical of the early Italian Renaissance. Its architecture reflects the philosophy of Renaissance humanism, the enlightenment and clarity of mind as opposed to the darkness and spirituality of the Middle Ages. The revival of classical antiquity can best be illustrated by the Palazzo Rucellai. Here the pilasters follow the superposition of classical orders, with Doric capitals on the ground floor, Ionic capitals on the &quot;piano nobile&quot; and Corinthian capitals on the uppermost floor. Soon, Renaissance architects favoured grand, large domes over tall and imposing spires, doing away with the Gothic style of the predating ages.

In Mantua, Alberti ushered in the new antique style, though his culminating work, Sant&#x27;Andrea, was not begun until 1472, after the architect&#x27;s death.

The High Renaissance, as we call the style today, was introduced to Rome with Donato Bramante&#x27;s Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio (1502) and his original centrally planned St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica (1506), which was the most notable architectural commission of the era, influenced by almost all notable Renaissance artists, including Michelangelo and Giacomo della Porta. The beginning of the late Renaissance in 1550 was marked by the development of a new column order by Andrea Palladio. Giant order columns that were two or more stories tall decorated the facades.

During the Italian Renaissance, mathematics was developed and spread widely. As a result, some Renaissance architects used mathematical knowledge like calculation in their drawings, such as Baldassarre Peruzzi.

===Music===

In Italy, during the 14th century, there was an explosion of musical activity that corresponded in scope and level of innovation to the activity in the other arts. Although musicologists typically group the music of the Trecento (music of the 14th century) with the late medieval period, it included features which align with the early Renaissance in important ways: an increasing emphasis on secular sources, styles and forms; a spreading of culture away from ecclesiastical institutions to the nobility, and even to the common people; and quick development of entirely new techniques. The principal forms were the Trecento madrigal, the caccia, and the ballata. Overall, the musical style of the period is sometimes labelled as the &quot;Italian ars nova.&quot; From the early 15th century to the middle of the 16th century, the centre of innovation in religious music was in the Low Countries, and a flood of talented composers came to Italy from this region. Many of them sang in either the papal choir in Rome or the choirs at the numerous chapels of the aristocracy, in Rome, Venice, Florence, Milan, Ferrara and elsewhere; and they brought their polyphonic style with them, influencing many native Italian composers during their stay.
The predominant forms of sacred music during the period were the mass and the motet. By far the most famous composer of church music in 16th-century Italy was Palestrina, the most prominent member of the Roman School, whose style of smooth, emotionally cool polyphony was to become the defining sound of the late 16th century, at least for generations of 19th- and 20th-century musicologists. Other Italian composers of the late 16th century focused on composing the main secular form of the era, the madrigal; for almost a hundred years these secular songs for multiple singers were distributed all over Europe. Composers of madrigals included Jacques Arcadelt, at the beginning of the age, Cipriano de Rore, in the middle of the century, and Luca Marenzio, Philippe de Monte, Carlo Gesualdo, and Claudio Monteverdi at the end of the era. Italy was also a centre of innovation in instrumental music. By the early 16th century keyboard improvisation came to be greatly valued, and numerous composers of virtuoso keyboard music appeared. Many familiar instruments were invented and perfected in late Renaissance Italy, such as the violin, the earliest forms of which came into use in the 1550s.

By the late 16th century, Italy was the musical centre of Europe. Almost all of the innovations which were to define the transition to the Baroque period originated in northern Italy in the last few decades of the century. In Venice, the polychoral productions of the Venetian School, and associated instrumental music, moved north into Germany; in Florence, the Florentine Camerata developed monody, the important precursor to opera, which itself first appeared around 1600; and the avant-garde, manneristic style of the Ferrara school, which migrated to Naples and elsewhere through the music of Carlo Gesualdo, was to be the final statement of the polyphonic vocal music of the Renaissance.

== Historiography ==
Any unified theory of a renaissance, or cultural overhaul, during the European early modern period, is overwhelmed by a massive volume of differing historiographical approaches. Historians like Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) have often romanticized the enlightened vision that Italian Renaissance writers have promulgated concerning their own narrative of denouncing the fruitlessness of the Middle Ages. By promoting the Renaissance as the definitive end to the &quot;stagnant&quot; Middle Ages, the Renaissance has acquired the powerful and enduring association with progress and prosperity for which Burckhardt&#x27;s &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot; is most responsible. Modern scholars have objected to this prevailing narrative, citing the medieval period&#x27;s own vibrancy and key continuities that link, rather than divide, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

Elizabeth Lehfeldt (2005) points to the Black Death as a turning point in Europe that set in motion several movements that were gaining massive traction in the years before, and has accounted for many subsequent events and trends in Western civilization, such as the Reformation. Rather than see this as a distinct cutoff between eras of history, the rejuvenated approach to studying the Renaissance aims to look at this as a catalyst that accelerated trends in art and science that were already well developed. For example, Danse Macabre, the artistic movement using death as the focal point, is often credited as a Renaissance trend, yet Lehfeldt argues that the emergence of Gothic art during medieval times was morphed into Danse Macabre after the Black Death swept over Europe.

Recent historians who take a more revisionist perspective, such as Charles Haskins (1860–1933), identify the hubris and nationalism of Italian politicians, thinkers, and writers as the cause of the distortion of the attitude towards the early modern period. In &quot;The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century&quot; (1927), Haskins asserts that it is human nature to draw stark divides in history to better understand the past. However, it is essential to understand history as continuous and constantly building off of the past. Haskins was one of the leading scholars in this school of thought, and it was his (along with several others) belief that the building blocks for the Italian Renaissance were all laid during the Middle Ages, calling on the rise of towns and bureaucratic states in the late 11th century as proof of the significance of this &quot;pre-renaissance.&quot; The flow of history that he describes paints the Renaissance as a continuation of the Middle Ages that may not have been as positive of a change as popularly imagined. Many historians after Burckhardt have argued that the regression of the Latin language, economic recession, and social inequality during the Renaissance have been intentionally glossed over by previous historians in order to promote the mysticism of the era.

Burckhardt famously described the Middle Ages as a period that was &quot;seen clad in strange hues&quot;, promoting the idea that this era was inherently dark, confusing, and unprogressive. The term &quot;middle&quot; ages was first referred to by humanists such as Petrarch and Biondo, during the late 15th century, describing it as a period connecting an important beginning and an important end, and as a placeholder for the history that exists between both sides of the period. This period was eventually referred to as the &quot;dark&quot; ages in the 19th century by English historians, which has further tainted the narrative of medieval times in favour of promoting a positive feeling of individualism and humanism that spurred from the Renaissance.

<text>Xenosauridae is a family of anguimorph lizards whose only living representative is the genus &quot;Xenosaurus&quot;, which is native to Central America. Xenosauridae also includes the extinct genera &quot;Exostinus&quot; and &quot;Restes&quot;. Also known as knob-scaled lizards, they have rounded, bumpy scales and osteoderms. Most living species prefer humid, rocky habitats, although they are widespread within their native regions, with some inhabiting semi-arid scrub environments. They are carnivorous or insectivorous, and give birth to live young.

&quot;Shinisaurus&quot;, the Chinese crocodile lizard, was once also regarded as a member of Xenosauridae, but most recent studies of the evolutionary relationships of anguimorphs consider &quot;Shinisaurus&quot; to be more closely related to monitor lizards and helodermatids than to &quot;Xenosaurus&quot;. Xenosauridae is part of a larger clade or evolutionary grouping called Carusioidea, which, in addition to xenosaurids, includes the extinct genus &quot;Carusia&quot;.

The oldest xenosaurids are known from the Cretaceous, including the Late Cretaceous of North America and Early Cretaceous of Asia.

<text>The Varanidae are a family of lizards in the superfamily Varanoidea and order Anguimorpha. The family, a group of carnivorous and frugivorous lizards, includes the living genus &quot;Varanus&quot; and a number of extinct genera more closely related to &quot;Varanus&quot; than to the earless monitor lizard (&quot;Lanthanotus&quot;). &quot;Varanus&quot; includes the Komodo dragon (the largest living lizard), crocodile monitor, savannah monitor, the goannas of Australia and Southeast Asia, and various other species with a similarly distinctive appearance. Their closest living relatives are the earless monitor lizard and Chinese crocodile lizard. The oldest members of the family are known from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia.

==Taxonomy==
The Varanidae were defined (using morphological characteristics) by Estes, de Queiroz and Gauthier (1988) as the clade containing the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Lanthanotus&quot; and &quot;Varanus&quot; and all of its descendants. A similar definition was formulated by Conrad &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) (also using morphological data), who defined the Varanidae as the clade containing &quot;Varanus varius&quot;, &quot;Lanthanotus borneensis&quot;, and all descendants of their last common ancestor. Using one of these definitions leads to the inclusion of the earless monitor lizard (&quot;L. borneensis&quot;) in the family Varanidae.

Lee (1997) created a different definition of the Varanidae, defining them as the clade containing &quot;Varanus&quot; and all taxa more closely related to &quot;Varanus&quot; than to &quot;Lanthanotus&quot;; this definition explicitly excludes the earless monitor lizard from the Varanidae. Whether &quot;L. borneensis&quot; is included in or excluded from the Varanidae depends on the author; for example, Vidal &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) classify the earless monitor lizard as a member of a separate family Lanthanotidae, while Gauthier &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) classify it as a member of Varanidae.

===Genera===

===Phylogeny===
Below is a cladogram from Dong et al. 2022.

==Biology==

Monitor lizards are reputed to be among the most intelligent lizards. Most species forage widely and have large home ranges, and many have high stamina. Although most species are carnivorous, three arboreal species in the Philippines (&quot;Varanus olivaceus&quot;, &quot;Varanus mabitang&quot;, and &quot;Varanus bitatawa&quot;) are primarily frugivores. Among species of living varanids, the limbs show positive allometry, being larger in larger-bodied species, although the feet become smaller as compared with the lengths of the other limb segments.

Varanids possess unidirectional pulmonary airflow, including air-sacs akin to those of birds.

<text>The earless monitor lizard (Lanthanotus borneensis) is a semiaquatic, brown lizard native to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo. It is the only living species in the family Lanthanotidae and it is related to the true monitor lizards.

==Taxonomy==
The earless monitor lizard was described in 1878 by Franz Steindachner. The genus name &quot;Lanthanotus&quot; means &quot;hidden ear&quot; and the species name &quot;borneensis&quot; refers to its home island of Borneo. The uniqueness of the species was immediately recognized and Steindachner placed it in its own family, Lanthanotidae. In 1899, George Albert Boulenger relegated it to the family Helodermatidae, together with the beaded lizards and Gila monster, on the basis of morphological similarities. Further studies were conducted in the 1950s where it was found that although it is related to Helodermatidae, this relationship is relatively distant. The similarity is in part the result of convergent evolution and they should be recognized as separate families. Both are part of a broader Anguimorpha, but the relationship among the various families has been a matter of dispute. Several earlier studies have placed the earless monitor lizard together with Helodermatidae and Varanidae (true monitor lizards) in Varanoidea. More recent genetic evidence has found that the nearest relative of the earless monitor lizard is Varanidae. Most authorities continue to recognize them as separate families as the divergence between them is deep, but some have suggested that the earless monitor lizard should be included as a subfamily, Lanthanotinae, of the Varanidae. Together they form a clade and its sister group is Shinisauridae; at a higher level the sister groups of these three are Helodermatidae and others families in Anguimorpha. The most recent common ancestor diverged in the mid-Cretaceous.

The extinct &quot;Cherminotus&quot; known from Late Cretaceous fossil remains in Mongolia has been considered a member of Lanthanotidae, but this is disputed.

==Distribution and habitat==
The earless monitor lizard is endemic to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo, where it is known from Sarawak in East Malaysia, as well as West and North Kalimantan in Indonesia. Until late 2012, its known range in North Kalimantan was a part of East Kalimantan. It was also confirmed to be found in Brunei for the first time in 2022, in the country&#x27;s Temburong District. Prior to the discovery, it was believed that they may occur there and has been recorded c. from the border. There are no records from Sabah, Central Kalimantan or South Kalimantan.

It is found in lowlands at elevations below near streams and marshes. These are typically in rainforests, but it is also found in streams flowing through degraded habitats such as agricultural land, mature fruit tree gardens and palm oil plantations, and reportedly may occur in rice paddies. The streams it inhabits are often rocky. Its habitat is tropical with air and water temperatures that generally are about , and captives reportedly prefer . At a site with a high density of earless monitor lizards the water was clear and had a neutral pH. It is associated with the same microhabitat as &quot;Tropidophorus&quot; water skinks and in some places its range overlaps with &quot;T. brookei&quot;.

==Appearance==
Earless monitor lizards have a cylindrical body, long neck, short limbs, long sharp claws, small eyes, semitransparent lower eyelids, and six longitudinal rows of strongly keeled scales. The species is extensively covered in osteoderms. Despite the name, they are capable of hearing, although lack a tympanum, an ear opening and other externally visible signs of ears. The upperparts are orangish-brown, and the underside is mottled dark brown and whitish, pale yellowish, ochre or rusty. The tail is prehensile and if it is lost, it is not regenerated. The skin is shed infrequently, possibly less than once a year. There are both reports of the skin shedding in one piece (similar to snakes), or in smaller pieces (as typical of lizards). Overall the sexes are alike, but males have a distinctly broader head and broader tail base than females. The differences between the sexes are clearly noticeable from an age of about three years. They sometimes oscillate the throat (similar to frogs) and the forked tongue is sometimes flicked (similar to snakes). They can make a gentle, squeaky vocalization.

===Size===
Adult earless monitor lizards typically have a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of about , and a total length of about . Eighteen wild individuals, six males and twelve females, ranged from in SVL, in tail length (disregarding one individual missing much of its tail), and in weight (disregarding one sickly and skinny individual). Among these, the largest total length (SVL+tail) was a male that measured , which also is the longest recorded in the wild. A specimen collected in the 1960s has a total length of , and near the time of its death an individual kept at the Bronx Zoo from 1968 to 1976 had a total length of and weighed , but it was highly obese. When hatching the total length of the young is about . When one year old, their total length is about .

==Behavior==
Earless monitor lizards are generally strictly nocturnal animals, although exceptional daytime observations in the open have been reported. The day is usually spent near water in burrows that can be up to long or under logs, rocks or vegetation. They are generally quite inactive and not agile, but can make surprisingly fast spurts when startled, and will rapidly catch prey items placed in front of them. During one study where 19 individuals were located during the night, about half were in the water and the other half near water on land. In captivity they sometimes remain virtually immobile underwater for hours, periodically lifting the nose above the water&#x27;s surface to breathe. When underwater, the semitransparent lower eyelids are generally closed, covering the eyes. It has been speculated that the prehensile tail is wrapped around stones, roots and other things underwater to avoid being swept along during floods.

===Bite===
Although generally docile and inactive when handled, males are usually more aggressive than females when caught. In one case, a scientist received a deep bite in his finger, but did not experience any effects that could indicate a presence of venom in the bite (unlike the related and venomous beaded lizards, Gila monster and some monitor lizards). This supported decades-old dissection studies where no venom glands or grooves in the teeth were found. Others kept in captivity were found to bite often, resulting in wounds that are relatively deep (compared to those from similar-sized lizards) and can bleed extensively, with blood clotting reportedly being slower than in normal wounds. Recent studies have found both venom glands, and toxic compounds in the bite of this species. The main components are kallikreins (to a lesser degree CRiSP) with the primary effect being the cleaving of fibrinogen, which is important for blood clotting. However, this effect is quite weak in the venom of the earless monitor lizard compared to that of many other venomous reptiles, including some of the true monitor lizards.

===Feeding===
They typically feed on earthworms, crustaceans and fish. In captivity, they will eat fish (both whole and pieces), earthworms, squid, shrimp, tadpoles, yolk from green sea turtle eggs, pieces of pig and chicken liver, baby mice and mussels, but refuse to take bird eggs and legs of frog. In captivity adults typically eat once or twice per week, but sometimes enter longer periods where they do not feed. Unusually for a lizard, they can swallow prey while submerged underwater. The only other monitor species reported to do this is Mertens&#x27; water monitor. They appear to be able to do this by draining water from their nostrils, similar to turtles.

===Breeding and life cycle===
Like their closest relatives, they are oviparous, although little is known about their reproduction. Based on captive observations a pair will mate repeatedly over a period of a few months, with each session lasting for hours. In one case, a single mating lasted 44 hours. They mate in the water. In the wild mating has been seen in February, and a female caught in April was likely gravid. The 2–12 (average 8) oval eggs measure about long and have a leathery white shell. They are deposited on land. In captivity the eggs hatch after about three months at a temperature of . Adult males are likely territorially aggressive, as a survey of a locality found twice as many females as males, and most of the males (but no females) had various injuries, such as loss of toes or tail, and scarring on the head or neck. In captivity, young up to 6 months old have been kept in groups, and adults have been kept singly, as pairs or a single male with several females; more than one adult male causes problems. The lifespan is unknown, but—despite the very limited knowledge of reptile keeping at the time—an individual that entered captivity as a young adult in the 1960s lived for more than 7.5 years after its capture (growing from in total length), and others have reportedly surpassed a decade in captivity.

== Status and conservation ==
The earless monitor lizard has been rated by the IUCN as endangered (its range covers less than ). The species is usually considered very rare, but it is easily overlooked and as recently as 1999 the only published confirmed records were from Sarawak. Confirmation from Kalimantan only appeared later. In some areas locals are unaware of its presence or consider it rare, but in others it may be common. At one site in West Kalimantan, 17 of 21 locals asked were aware of its presence and most of these considered it common. At three other sites in the region the majority asked were aware of its presence, but less than half considered it common. Elsewhere in West Kalimantan, a three-night survey of a long section of a stream, as well as two adjacent streams, located 19 earless monitor lizards, representing an unusually high density for a lizard of this size. Despite this high density in a stream used by locals for washing, fishing and as a source of drinking water, they only reported seeing the species very rarely and some had never seen it. Nevertheless, at present the earless monitor lizard is only known for certain from a relatively small number of sites.

About 100 museum specimens are known and most major natural history museums have one or more in their collection. These were generally collected in the 1960s–1980s or earlier, often during floods when earless monitor lizards were swept along the current and ended up in fishing traps. From the 1960s to the 1990s small numbers entered the pet trade. In 2012 it was featured in a Japanese reptile keepers magazine and in the following years a larger number of individuals entered captivity. From May 2014 to October 2015 at least 95 earless monitor lizards appeared in the trade in Asia (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia), Europe (Czech Republic, France, Germany, Netherlands, Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom) and the United States. Collecting the species from the wild is illegal; the earless monitor lizard has been protected in Malaysia since 1971, in Brunei since 1978 and in Indonesia since 1980. Penalties range from a fine of US$1,600 and one year&#x27;s imprisonment (Brunei) to $7,850 and three years&#x27; imprisonment (Malaysia), to $8,600 and five years&#x27; imprisonment (Indonesia). As a precaution some scientists that have discovered individuals in the wild have refused to provide the exact location, only describing it in very broad terms, citing fears of alerting wildlife traders. In 2015, a smuggler was caught in an Indonesian airport with 8 individuals and in 2016 another was caught in an Indonesian airport with 17 individuals. This trade is supported by the very high price. When first entering the market in Japan, a pair sold for ¥3 million (more than US$25,000). Although the price has since fallen by more than 90% due to increased availability, it remains valuable. Significant declines in price have also been noted elsewhere. Unlike all other monitor species, the earless monitor lizard was not listed on CITES, which would restrict trade at an international level. In 2016 it was proposed that it should be placed on CITES Appendix I, and in 2017 it was afforded a level of protection when placed on Appendix II (export quota is zero for wild individuals for commercial purposes).

The first confirmed captive breeding was at a zoo in Japan in 2014. A couple of years later a few European zoos initiated a breeding program; in 2017 it was bred at Schönbrunn Zoo in Austria, and in 2018 it was bred a Prague Zoo in the Czech Republic and Moscow Zoo in Russia. There have been other breeding reports by private keepers and captive bred individuals have been offered for sale, but some of these may not involve genuine cases of captive breeding.

Habitat loss represents another serious threat, as forests in Borneo rapidly are being replaced by oil palm plantations. However, the earless monitor lizard can survive in high densities in areas surrounded by degraded habitats (including oil palm plantations), and rocky streams, possibly its preferred habitat, are relatively unaffected by humans.
