<text>Dactyloidae are a family of lizards commonly known as anoles () and native to warmer parts of the Americas, ranging from southeastern United States to Paraguay. Instead of treating it as a family, some authorities prefer to treat it as a subfamily, Dactyloinae, of the family Iguanidae. In the past they were included in the family Polychrotidae together with &quot;Polychrus&quot; (bush anoles), but the latter genus is not closely related to the true anoles.

Anoles are small to fairly large lizards, typically green or brownish, but their color varies depending on species and many can also change it. In most species at least the male has a dewlap, an often brightly colored flap of skin that extends from the throat and is used in displays. Anoles share several characteristics with geckos, including details of the foot structure (for climbing) and the ability to voluntarily break off the tail (to escape predators), but they are only very distantly related, anoles being part of Iguania.

Anoles are active during the day and feed mostly on small animals such as insects, but some will also take fruits, flowers, and nectar. Almost all species are fiercely territorial. After mating, the female lays an egg (occasionally two); in many species she may do so every few days or weeks. The egg is typically placed on the ground, but in some species it is placed at higher levels.

Anoles are widely studied in fields such as ecology, behavior, and evolution, and some species are commonly kept in captivity as pets. Anoles can function as a biological pest control by eating insects that may harm humans or plants, but represent a serious risk to small native animals and ecosystems if introduced to regions outside their home range.

==Distribution and habitat==

Anoles are a very diverse and plentiful group of lizards. They are native to tropical and subtropical South America, Central America, Mexico, the offshore East Pacific Cocos, Gorgona and Malpelo Islands, the West Indies and southeastern United States.

A particularly high species richness exists in Cuba (more than 60 species), Hispaniola (more than 55), Mexico (more than 50), Central America, Colombia (more than 75), and Ecuador (at least 40). Fewer live in eastern and central South America (for example, less than 20 species are known from huge Brazil), Contiguous United States (1 native species), and the Lesser Antilles (about 25 species in total, with 1–2 species on each island). However, the Lesser Antilles are relatively rich compared to their very small land area and their species are all highly localized endemics, each only found on one or a few diminutive islands. In South America, the diversity is considerably higher west of the Andes (Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena region) than east (Amazon basin), as well illustrated in Ecuador where about of the anole species live in the former region and in the latter.

The only species native to the contiguous United States is the Carolina (or green) anole, which ranges as far west as central Texas, and north to Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Its northern limit is likely related to cold winter temperatures. Several anole species have been introduced to the contiguous US, mostly Florida, but also other Gulf Coast states and California. The most prevalent of these introductions is the brown anole. In contrast to the contiguous United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are home to 16 native species, all endemic.

Anoles inhabit a wide range of habitats, from highlands (up to at least above sea level) to the coast, and rainforest to desert scrub. A few live in limestone karst habitats and at least two of these, the Cuban cave anole and Mexican cave anole, will enter caves, sometimes occurring as much as from the entrance. Some species live close to humans and may use fences or walls of building as perches, even inhabiting gardens or trees along roads in large cities like Miami. Most anoles are arboreal or semi-arboreal, but there are also terrestrial and semiaquatic species. They are often, especially in the Caribbean, grouped into six ecomorphs—crown giant, trunk crown, trunk, trunk ground, twig, and grass bush—that inhabit specific niches. Other less widely used groups are ground, ground bush, twig giant, , and riparian (alternatively semi-aquatic). However, the species within each ecomorph group are not entirely alike and there are variations in the details of their niches, including both widespread generalists and more restricted specialists. The niche differentiation allows several anoles to inhabit the same locality, with up to 15 species at a single site.

==Appearance and behavior==
Anoles vary in size. Males generally reach a larger size than females, but in a few species it is the other way around. Adults of most anoles are between in snout-to-vent length, and between in total length, including the tail. In the smallest, the five-striped grass anole, the snout-to-vent length is about in females and males respectively, but it is a relatively long-tailed species. There are several large species that are more than in snout-to-vent length. Males of the largest, the knight anole, reach up to about in snout-to-vent length, in total length, and in weight. There are both robust and gracile species, and the head shape varies from relatively broad to elongate.

The tail of anoles varies, but mostly it is longer than the snout-to-vent length. Depending on exact species it can range from slightly shorter to about three times the snout-to-vent. The Caribbean twig ecomorph anoles, proboscis anole and &quot;Phenacosaurus&quot; anoles have a prehensile tail. Semi-aquatic anoles tend to have relatively tall, vertically flattened tails that aid in swimming, and their skin has certain microstructures that make it hydrophobic, resulting in a thin film of air on the skin surface when submerged and preventing water from staying on when exiting the water.

Underneath an anole&#x27;s toes are pads that have several to a dozen flaps of skin (adhesive lamellae) going horizontally and covered in microscopic hairlike protrusions (setae) that allow them to cling to many different surfaces, similar to but not quite as efficient as a gecko. Despite this similarity, they are very distantly related and the adaptions are the result of convergent evolution in the two groups. The extent of these structures and clinging ability varies, being more developed in anole species that live high in the tree canopy than ones living at lower levels. In one extreme are anoles that easily can run up windows. In the opposite end of the spectrum is the bulky anole of arid coastal Venezuela and adjacent Colombia, which is the only species completely lacking the specialized toe pad structures. The relative length of the limbs vary, mainly between different species, but to some extent also between different populations of a single species. This depends on things like the preferred perch size and whether there are ground-living predators in a habitat.

Despite having relatively small eyes, their primary sense is sight, which is excellent and in color. Their pupils are round or nearly round. The Guantanamo anole and Cuban cave anole have a transparent &quot;window&quot; in their lower eyelid, allowing them to see even with closed eyes, but why they have this adaption is unclear. Anoles have a good directional hearing, which is able to detect frequencies between 1000 and 7000 Hz and relatively low intensity sounds like the click of a camera.

Anoles are diurnal—active during the daytime—but can also be active during bright moonlit nights and may forage near artificial lights. Many species frequently bask in the sun to increase their temperature, but others are shade-living and do not.

===Colors===
Most anoles are brownish or green, but there are extensive variations depending on the exact species. The majority can change their color depending on things like emotions (for example, aggression or stress), activity level, levels of light and as a social signal (for example, displaying dominance), but evidence showing that they do it in response to the color of the background (camouflage) is lacking. Whether they do it in response to temperature (thermoregulation) is less clear, with studies supporting it and contradicting it. The extent and variations of this color changing ability differ widely throughout the individual species. For example, the Carolina (or green) anole can change its color from a bright, leafy green to a dull brown color, while the brown anole can only change its shade, ranging from pale gray-brown to very dark brown. Even the distinct green-to-brown change in the Carolina anole can happen in only a few minutes. The colors are the result of their skin pigment cells, the chromatophores, of which they have three main types, but the change occurs only in the melanophores. When triggered by melanophore-stimulating hormone and other hormones, the melanosomes of the melanophores partially cover the other skin pigment cells, giving the anole a darker or browner color. In most cases stress results in a darker/browner color, but in the aquatic anole, a species that is dark brown with a barred pattern and light brown stripes on the sides of its body and head, stress results in paler brown upper parts and the stripes turn pale blue-green.

Their colors during the night when sleeping often differ distinctly from their colors during the day where awake. Among these are some species that otherwise do not drastically change their colors, including certain anoles that generally are brown during the day changing to greenish or whitish when sleeping at night, and certain anoles that generally are green during the day changing to brown when sleeping at night.

Disregarding color change, minor individual variations in the basic color and pattern, mostly related to sex or age, are common. In some anole species this variation is more pronounced and not only related to sex and age. An example of this is the basic color of the Cayman blue-throated anole, which varies geographically, roughly matching the main habitat at a location. In others it occurs at the same location. This includes the extensive individual variations in the Guadeloupean anole, which however also shows some geographic variations, but possibly not consistent enough (due in part to clines) to make the typically recognized subspecies valid. In the Puerto Rican giant anole, a species only able to perform minor color changes (essentially lightness/darkness), juveniles are gray-brown and adults typically green, but an uncommon morph maintains a gray-brown color into adulthood. Similarly, rare morphs of the usually green Carolina anole lack certain pigment cells, giving them a mainly turquoise-blue or yellow color.

===Dewlap===
Most—but not all—anole species have dewlaps, made of erectile cartilage (modified from the hyoid) and covered in skin, that extend from their throat areas. When not in use and closed it lies inconspicuously along the throat and chest. The size, shape, color and pattern of the dewlap vary extensively depending on species, and often it differs between the sexes, being smaller (in some absent) or less colorful in females. In a few species, including the Carolina, bark, Cochran&#x27;s gianthead and slender anoles, it varies geographically in color depending on subspecies or morph. Very locally, distinct morphs of a single species that differ in dewlap colors (not just differences between sexes) may occur together. In addition to colors that are visible to humans, dewlaps can have ultraviolet reflectance, which is visible to anoles. The striped anole is the only species where it is asymmetrically colored, being brighter on one side than the other. In some species even juveniles have a dewlap. The West Cuban and Cuban stream anoles are the only where both sexes lack a dewlap, but it is reduced and diminutive in about a dozen other species.

The dewlap serves as a signal for attracting partners, territoriality, deterring predators and communicating condition. When several anoles live together the species almost always differ in their dewlap, indicating that it plays a role in species recognition. Studies however reveal a more complex pattern: The bark anole and short nosed anole species complex (which includes the Webster&#x27;s and Cochran&#x27;s gianthead anoles) are closely related and both vary in their dewlap color. In places where their ranges overlap their dewlaps often differ and there is little hybridization, but in some locations their dewlaps are alike. Where alike there can be higher levels of hybridization (indicating that they are more likely to confuse each other) or levels can be as low as regions where they differ (indicating that something else allows them to separate each other). Another example is the red-fanned stout and large-headed anoles, which are sister species that overlap in range and are very similar except for their dewlap color. They are highly aggressive to individuals of their own species, but not the other. When one species has its dewlap color modified to resemble the other, only a relatively minor or no increase in aggression occurs, indicating that they still can separate each other.

Several other Iguania genera, &quot;Draco&quot;, &quot;Otocryptis&quot;, &quot;Polychrus&quot;, &quot;Sarada&quot; and &quot;Sitana&quot;, have evolved relatively large, movable dewlaps independently of the anoles.

===Sexual dimorphism===
In some anoles the sexes are very similar and difficult to separated under normal viewing conditions, but most species exhibit clear sexual dimorphism, which allows one to fairly easily discern between adult males and females. In a few species the female is slightly larger than the male, but in others the sexes are about the same size. However, in most the males are larger, in some more than three times the mass of females. This size difference can result in differences in the microhabitat (for example, males using larger branches than females) and feeding (males on average eating large prey) between the sexes of a single species. Males of some species have proportionally far longer heads than females, but in others it is nearly alike. The crest along the nape, back and/or tail is larger in the males. In species with tall crests this difference can be obvious, but in small-crested species it is often inconspicuous and easily overlooked, especially when not raised. The dewlap is often larger in males; in some species only the male has a dewlap. In a few there are differences in the shape of the nose, but this is only known to be prominent in the proboscis and leaf-nosed anoles, which both have long-nosed males and more normal looking females (it is likely that something similar can be seen in smooth anole, but the female of that species is still unknown). A less obvious difference between anole sexes is the enlarged post-cloacal scales in males.

The males of many species are overall more brightly colored, while females are duller, more cryptic, and sometimes their upperparts have striped or lined patterns that serve to break up the outline of the anole. In general, the juvenile colors and pattern resemble those of the adult female. The dewlap tends to be more colorful in males, with clear differences being common among anoles of the mainland of the Americas and comparatively rarer in the Caribbean species.

===Territoriality and breeding===

Almost all anole species are highly territorial, at least the males, but a few exceptions do exist, including the rock-living Agassiz&#x27;s and Taylor&#x27;s anoles where males do not defend a territory, and the grass anole where dominant males accept subordinant non-territorial males within their territory. Territorial anoles will fan their dewlap, bob their head, perform &quot;push-ups&quot;, raise their crest and do a wide range of other behaviors to scare away potential competitors. If this does not scare off the intruder, a fight proceeds in which the two anoles attempt to bite each other. During fights some species of anoles are known to vocalize. In addition to the behaviors indicating dominance, anoles may move their head up and down in a head-nod display (not to be confused with the head-bob display where entire frontal part of body is moved through &quot;push-ups&quot;), which is a submissive sign. Females maintain a feeding territory. Males maintain a larger breeding territory, which overlaps with the feeding territory of one or several females. The home range is generally larger in males than in females, and larger in large anole species than in smaller. In a very small species like the Bahoruco long-snouted anole the home range can be as little is about and in a female and male, compared to a large species like the knight anole where they average about and . If removed from its territory an anole will usually be able to find its way back home in a relatively short time, but exactly how they do this is unclear. Generally being highly solitary animals, anoles will only infrequently congregate, but in colder regions individuals may rest adjacent to each other in groups during the winter.

In addition to differences in the appearance of the dewlap, the frequency of the dewlap opening/closing and the frequency and amplitude of the head bobbing differ between species, allowing them to separate each other. Territoriality is typically aimed at other individuals of the same species, but in a few cases it is also directed towards other anoles, as can be seen between the crested and Cook&#x27;s anoles. Unlike most anoles with widely overlapping ranges, these two inhabit very similar niches and directly compete for resources.

The breeding period varies. In species or populations living in highly seasonal regions it is generally relatively short, typically during the wet season. It is prolonged, often even year-round, in species or populations living in regions with less distinct seasons. In some species where it is year-round the egg production is however higher during the rainy season than the dry season, and in many where it is prolonged but not year-round, it begins in the spring and ends in the fall. Males attract and court females by performing a range of behaviors, often mirroring those used to scare away competitors, including extending their dewlap and bobbing their heads. During mating the male inserts one of his hemipenes into the female&#x27;s cloaca, fertilizing the egg inside the oviduct. The female may mate with multiple males, but is also able to store sperm inside her body for fertilization of eggs several months after mating. A female anole produces an egg in each ovary, meaning that when one is maturing in one of her follicles the yolk of another is forming in the other. The white shell only forms when the egg has been fertilized and females will sometimes lay infertile, unshelled yellowish eggs known as &quot;slugs&quot;. The female lays one (occasionally two) eggs per time, which typically is placed casually on the ground among leaf-litter, under debris, logs or rocks, or in a small hole. In some species it is placed at higher levels in a bromeliad, tree hole or rock crevice. A small number of species lay their eggs together, forming a communal nest. Among these is the unusual Cuban cave anole where as many as 25 eggs may be glued together in a small cavity on the side of a cave wall. A nest that contained eggs from the bay anole and the geckos &quot;Sphaerodactylus armasi&quot; and &quot;Tarentola crombiei&quot; represents the only known multi-species communal nest for an anole and the only known communal nest involving more than one family of lizard. Although typically only laying a single egg per time (clutch), females of many anole species can lay an egg every five days to four weeks. Some only have a single clutch per year, while other species may have as many as 20 on average. Depending on species, anole eggs hatch after about 30–70 days.

===Feeding===
Anoles are opportunistic feeders, and may attempt to eat any attractive meal that is of the right size. They primarily feed on insects like flies, grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, beetles and ants, and arachnids like spiders. Several species will also eat small vertebrates such as mice, small birds (including nestlings), lizards (including other anole species and Cannibalism of their own) and frogs. The slow-moving Cuban false chameleon anoles (&quot;Chamaeleolis&quot;) are specialized snail-eaters, and a few semi-aquatic species like the Cuban stream anole may catch prey in water such as shrimp and small fish. In some species the average prey-size varies with the individual anole&#x27;s size, age and sex, with juvenile anoles eating the smallest prey, adult females taking intermediate-sized prey and adult males the largest prey. In other species there are no clear differences in the preferred prey size, regardless of an individual&#x27;s size and sex.

Hunting is done by sight, and they generally show a strong preference for moving prey over non-moving. Many will chase down or sneak up to a potential prey item, while others are sit-and-wait predators that pounce on prey when it gets close to the anole. Anoles have numerous small, sharp and pointed teeth that allow them to efficiently grab their prey. They are heterodonts with each tooth in the frontal half of the jaw having a single tip (unicuspid) and each in the rear half having three tips (tricuspid); one in the middle and a smaller behind and in front of it. Unusually, the Cuban false chameleon anoles have enlarged and blunt, molar-like teeth in the rear part of their jaw, allowing them to crush the shells of their snail prey.

In addition to animal prey, many anole species will take plant material, notably fruits, flowers and nectar, and overall they are best described as omnivorous. Some fruit-eating species, like the knight anole, may function as seed dispersers. Anoles have been recorded drinking sweetened water from hummingbird feeders. Anoles are vulnerable to drying out and generally need access to water for drinking, like dew or rain on leaves, although some species are less susceptible to water loss than others and are able to live in relatively arid places.

===Predator avoidance and deterrence===
A wide range of animals will eat anoles, such as large spiders, centipedes, predatory katydids, snakes, large frogs, lizards, birds, monkeys, bats and carnivoran mammals. At least in part of their range, snakes may be the most significant predator of anoles. For example, the Caribbean &quot;Alsophis&quot; and &quot;Borikenophis&quot; racers, and the Mexican, Central American and South American &quot;Oxybelis&quot; vine snakes feed mostly on lizards like anoles. Some reptile-eating snakes have a specialized venom that has little effect on humans, but it rapidly kills an anole. On some Caribbean Islands anoles make up as much as 40–75% of the diet of American kestrels. Large anoles may eat smaller individuals of other anole species and cannibalism—eating smaller individuals of their own species—is also widespread. There is a documented case of a small anole being captured and killed by an outside potted Venus flytrap plant.

Anoles mainly detect potential enemies by sight, but their hearing range also closely matches the typical vocal range of birds. If hearing a predatory bird, like a kestrel or hawk, they increase their vigilance. When hearing a non-predatory bird little or no change happens. Most anole species will try to escape from a predator by rapidly running or climbing away, but some will move to the opposite side of a tree trunk (facing away from the would-be attacker), jump to the ground from their perch, or freeze when disturbed, hoping the adversary does not spot it. Some anole species will show their fitness by displaying their dewlap when encountering a predator; the greater the endurance of the anole, the greater the display. Conversely, when suddenly forced to share their habitat with an efficient anole predator like the northern curly-tailed lizard (for example, if it is introduced to a place where formerly not present), the anoles may decrease the amplitude of their head bobbing, making them less conspicuous, and may become slower to emerge from hiding (less willing to take a risk) after having been scared by a predator. Slow-moving anoles, like the twig ecomorphs of the Caribbean and many &quot;Dactyloa&quot; species of mainland Central and South America, are generally cryptically colored and often coordinate their movements with the wind, resembling the surrounding vegetation. A few semi-aquatic species will attempt to escape from predators by diving into water or running bipedally across it, similar to basilisks. However, the anoles lack the specialized toe fringes that helps basilisks when doing this.

Anole tails often have the ability to break off at special segments, which is known as autotomy. The tail continues to wriggle for a period after detaching, attracting the attention of the predator and commonly allowing the anole to escape. The tail is regenerated, but it takes more than two months to complete this process. About two dozen anoles, including almost all members of the &quot;latifrons&quot; species group, all in the &quot;chamaeleonidae&quot; species group and the La Palma anole, do not have the ability to autotomize the tail.

If caught or cornered, anoles will bite in self-defense. This can be relatively effective against some predators. When fighting back and biting, sometimes for as much as 20 minutes, Puerto Rican crested anoles escape from more than of all attacks by Puerto Rican racer snakes. Some species of anoles will vocalize (typically growls, chirps or squeals) when caught.

==Evolution==
The evolution of anoles has been widely studied, and they have been described as a &quot;textbook example of adaptive radiation and convergent evolution&quot;. Especially the widespread convergent evolution seen in anoles living in the Greater Antilles has attracted the attention of scientists, and resulted in comparisons with the Darwin&#x27;s finches of the Galápagos Islands, lemurs of Madagascar and cichlid fish in the African Great Lakes.

===Ecomorphs and origin===


On each major Greater Antillean Island (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Jamaica), there are anole species that have adapted to specific niches and are referred to as ecomorphs: crown giant, trunk crown, trunk, trunk ground, twig and grass bush (a few additional, less widely used ecomorphs also exist). However, even within the Greater Antilles there are differences depending on island size and the amount of available habitats. The largest, Cuba and Hispaniola, have all six primary ecomorphs, while the smaller Puerto Rico and Jamaica have five and four respectively. Species living in a specific niche on each island tend to resemble each other in both appearance and behavior. For example, the Escambray twig anole of Cuba closely resembles the Puerto Rican twig and Jamaican twig anoles, as well as several species of twig ecomorphs from Hispaniola. Despite this they are not closely related and have adapted to their specific niche independently of each other. At least four of the six primary ecomorphs are of ancient origin as they have been documented in amber fossils from Hispaniola that are about 15–20 million years old (the two missing ecomorphs are crown giant and grass bush). Otherwise there are few known fossils, but early phylogenetic and immunological studies indicate that anoles originated 40–66 million years ago, first inhabitant Central or South America, and then came to the Caribbean (initially likely Cuba or Hispaniola). A more recent phylogenetic study, published in 2012, indicated that anoles originated in South America and diverged from other reptiles far earlier, about 95 million years ago. While a South American origin has been generally accepted, the very high age has been controversial and other studies published in 2011–2014 arrived at a lower age, estimating that anoles diverged from other reptiles 23–75, 53–72 or 81–83 million years ago, while a comprehensive study from 2017 estimated about 46–65 million years ago. This indicates that early anoles arrived on the Greater Antillean Islands in the Caribbean from the mainland of the Americas via rafting rather than overland via ancient (now submerged) land bridges. After arriving in the Caribbean they diversified into several new groups and one of these, the &quot;Norops&quot; lineage, later made its way back to mainland of the Americas.

===Species and adaptability===

Species level evolution in anoles can be very slow. Martinique originally consisted of four tiny islands, which then merged into a single as a result of uplifting. Anoles lived on each of the tiny ancient islands and were isolated six to eight million years ago. Despite this long separation, they did not experience allopatric speciation, as mixed couples of the different Martinique anole populations can successfully reproduce and remain part of a single species. The Barbados anole is part of the same group, but Barbados remains a separate, isolated island. The genetic divergence between the different Martinique anole populations is similar to that between other Lesser Antillean anoles consistently recognized as separate species. Another Lesser Antillean species, the Guadeloupean anole, has several distinct populations that generally are recognized as subspecies. However, Guadeloupean anoles exhibit high individual variability and the populations widely intergrade, something that possibly has been enhanced by habitat changes by humans (allowing populations to easier come into contact with each other) and translocations of individuals. This indicates that the subspecies are invalid today. Genetic studies confirm that strong assortative mating between the different Guadeloupean anole populations does not exist, despite their distinct differences in appearance and them having separated about 650,000 years ago (confidence interval starting at 351,000 years). Hybridization between different anole species has rarely been documented.

In contrast to this, anoles can change rapidly in response to changes, which is an example of microevolution. They are one of the few known examples of &quot;visible evolution&quot; (i.e., where changes happen at a speed where they can be observed within a human lifetime), together with groups like stickleback fish, guppies and &quot;Peromyscus&quot; beach mice. In studies of brown anoles introduced to Florida it has been seen that they can become longer-legged in a single generation when living with the predatory, ground-living northern curly-tailed lizard (shorter-legged anoles are slower and easier to catch for the curly-tailed lizard). Over a longer period, however, their legs become shorter, which are better suited for perching on smaller branches higher off the ground, out of reach for the curly-tailed lizard. When brown anoles are introduced to small islands with low vegetation, their legs become shorter, better suited for rapidly moving among the shrunken shrubbery to catch insects and avoid predatory birds. Furthermore, in a study where brown anoles were introduced to seven small, anole-free Bahaman islands (anoles had disappeared because of Hurricane Frances), it was seen that—although all populations became shorter-legged within a few years—this was proportional to the leg-size of the founders. In other words: The few founder brown anoles introduced to one island were shorter-legged than the few introduced to another. Both populations became shorter-legged over time, but the first remained shorter-legged than the second. This is an example of the founder effect. Similarly, when brown anoles were introduced to Florida, the native Carolina (or green) anoles moved to higher perches and gained larger toe pads better suited for those perches. This adaptation occurred in just 20 generations. Anoles are also adapting to life with humans: Puerto Rican crested anoles living in cities have developed more adhesive lamellae on their toe pads than ones living in forests, reflecting the need for being able to climb very smooth surfaces like windows in the former habitat. In contrast to these fast changes, anole&#x27;s adaptability to temperature changes has traditionally been considered relatively minor. Nevertheless, when Puerto Rican crested anoles in Florida (where introduced in the 1970s) were compared to the original, native population in Puerto Rico, it was discovered that the former had become adapted to colder temperatures, by about 3 °C (5.4 °F). An even faster adaption was observed in Carolina anoles from Texas during the unusually cold winter of 2013–2014. Carolina anoles living in central Texas and further north were already adapted to relatively cold temperatures, but those of southern Texas were not. However, after the winter of 2013–2014, the cold tolerance of the southern Texan populations had increased by as much as 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and their genomic profiles had changed to more closely resemble the more northerly living Carolina anoles.

===Taxonomy===
The name for this group of lizards originates from the Carib &quot;anoli&quot;. It was modified and used in French Creole, and then transferred to English via the genus name &quot;Anolis&quot;, coined by French zoologist François Marie Daudin in 1802.

Several family names have been used for the anoles in recent decades. Initially they were placed in Iguanidae. This family, then comprising several very different groups, was split into eight families in 1989, with anoles being part of Polychrotidae together with &quot;Polychrus&quot; (bush anoles). However, genetic studies have shown that &quot;Polychrus&quot; is closer to Hoplocercidae than the true anoles. The true anoles are closer to Corytophanidae (basilisks and relatives). The true anoles have therefore been transferred to their own family Dactyloidae, alternatively listed as subfamily Dactyloinae of family Iguanidae. The name Anolidae (Cope, 1864) has sometimes been used, but it is a junior synonym of Dactyloidae (Fitzinger, 1843).

More than 425 species of true anoles are known. New species are regularly described, including 12 in 2016 alone. Most of the recent discoveries have been from the mainland of the Americas, with fewer new anoles described from the comparatively better-known Caribbean Islands.

====Genera====
Traditionally, all the true anoles were included in the genus &quot;Anolis&quot; and some continue to use this treatment, in which case it is the largest genus of reptile. An attempt of dividing this huge genus was already made in 1959–1960, when they were placed in two major groups, the so-called &quot;alpha anoles&quot; (comprising most anole subgroups) and &quot;beta anoles&quot; (equalling today&#x27;s &quot;Norops&quot;). In the following decades other changes were recommended. This included a proposal to recognize four genera, &quot;Anolis&quot;, &quot;Chamaeleolis&quot;, &quot;Chamaelinorops&quot; and &quot;Phenacosaurus&quot;, in 1976. In 1986, it was proposed that eight should be recognized: the four from 1976, and &quot;Ctenonotus&quot;, &quot;Dactyloa&quot;, &quot;Norops&quot; and &quot;Semiurus&quot; (the last was later replaced by its senior synonym &quot;Xiphosurus&quot;). These changes were adopted by some and rejected by others, who continued placing all in &quot;Anolis&quot;. In 1998–1999, the first comprehensive molecular studies of the anoles were published, confirming the earlier suspicion that the so-called &quot;beta anoles&quot; are a monophyletic group, but the &quot;alpha anoles&quot; are not. Furthermore, the genus splits proposed in 1976 and 1986 caused problems, as the narrowly defined &quot;Anolis&quot; was not monophyletic. In 2004, a major review based on several types of data (both molecular and morphological) revealed several groups and partially confirmed the genetic results from 1998 to 1999. No major changes were proposed and all anoles were maintained in a broadly defined &quot;Anolis&quot;. Two recent studies, primarily genetic and published in 2012 and 2017, confirmed several of the groups found in earlier studies, but rejected others. They found that the anoles fall into eight primary clades. Some of these can be further subdivided: For example, &quot;Chamaeleolis&quot; (from Cuba) is one of two subclades within &quot;Xiphosurus&quot; and it is sometimes considered a valid genus (in which case &quot;Xiphosurus&quot; is restricted to Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and nearby smaller islands). In contrast, the earlier proposed genus &quot;Phenacosaurus&quot; (from the Andes and tepui highlands in northwestern South America) is now included in &quot;Dactyloa&quot;. The phylogenetic position of most species is clear, but in a few the available evidence is conflicting and/or labelled with considerable statistic uncertainty.

The relationship of Dactyloidae can be described with a cladogram. Whether the eight groups are best recognized as separate genera or only as clades within a single genus, &quot;Anolis&quot;, is disputed. A few families between Polychrotidae and Corytophanidae+Dactyloidae are not shown:

==Relationship with humans==
Anoles are model organisms often studied in fields such as ecology, behavior, physiology and evolution. The Carolina (or green) anole is the most-studied anole species, with the earliest dedicated studies being more than 100 years old, from the late 1800s. The Carolina anole was the first reptile where the entire genome was sequenced.

Anoles are harmless to humans, but if caught or cornered they will bite in self-defense. As typical of animals, the bite force is strongly correlated to the size of the anole. It causes little pain in the smaller anoles which usually do not break the skin. Large species have relatively strong jaws lined with small, sharp teeth, and their bite can be painful and result in a superficial wound, but it is still essentially harmless.

Some anole species are commonly kept in captivity as pets and especially the Carolina (or green) anole is often described as a good &quot;beginner&#x27;s reptile&quot;, but it too requires specialized care.

Anoles can function as a biological pest control by eating pest insects that may harm humans or plants. Anole abundances can be considerably higher in diversified agroecosystems (multiple different plant types) than high-intensity agroecosystems (typically only one or very few plant types, and regular use of agrochemicals), making the former particularly suitable for this type of pest control. However, because of their potential of becoming invasive species, releasing anoles outside their native range is strongly discouraged and often illegal, even if the species occurs elsewhere in a country (for example, it is illegal to release Carolina anoles in California, as its native range is in the Southeastern United States).

===Conservation===

The willingness of many anoles of living close to humans in heavily altered habitats have made them common. Some anoles can occur in very high densities, as illustrated by the Saint Vincent bush, Puerto Rican bush and spotted anoles where it has been estimated that there locally are almost 28,000 individuals per hectare (11,500 per acre) in the first species and at least 20,000–21,000 per hectare (8,000–8,500 per acre) in the last two. However, in most species the density is lower and in rare anoles it can be well below 100 individuals per hectare (40 per acre). Some are restricted to specific habitats such as primary rainforest, making them more vulnerable. In a review in 2017, it was found that more than 50 anole species had a known total range that covered or less around their type locality. , only 90 anoles, equalling less than one-quarter of the total number of recognized species, had been rated by the IUCN. Most of these are either least concern (not threatened) or data deficient (limited available data prevents an assessment), but 7 are considered vulnerable, 14 endangered and 1 critically endangered. Typical threats to these are habitat loss from both humans and extreme weather, or competition/predation by introduced species. For example, the Finca Ceres anole, a critically endangered species only known from a single unprotected location in Matanzas Province, Cuba, has suffered habitat loss both due to hurricanes and expanding agricultural land. &quot;A. amplisquamosus&quot;, a critically endangered species only known from highland forest in the Cusuco National Park region of Honduras, was common in the early 2000s, but by 2006 it had experienced a drastic decline and was only infrequently encountered. A clear explanation for this is lacking, although it may be related to habitat loss due to human development and agriculture. Similarly, &quot;A. landestoyi&quot;, which only was described in 2016 and has not been rated by the IUCN, is restricted to the Loma Charco Azul reserve in Hispaniola, but it is seriously threatened by continuing illegal habitat destruction by slash-and-burn agriculture, livestock grazing and production of wood charcoal. Certain highly localized species can be threatened by other anoles. The Cook&#x27;s anole, found only in southwestern Puerto Rico and considered endangered by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, faces habitat loss and fragmentation from human development, predation by introduced species (especially cats and rats) and direct competition from a more widespread native, the Puerto Rican crested anole. The Puerto Rican crested anole has also been introduced to Dominica where it locally is outcompeting the endemic Dominican anole, having already largely displaced the South Caribbean ecotype (traditionally subspecies &quot;Anolis o. oculatus&quot;), which possibly may require a captive breeding program to ensure its survival.

Nevertheless, anoles overall do not appear to have experienced the widespread extinctions and extirpations prevalent among larger Caribbean reptiles. The Culebra Island giant anole is the only anole considered possibly extinct in recent history (other extinct anoles are prehistoric and only known from fossil remains that are millions of years old). Locals reported sighting of the Culebra Island giant anole as recent as the 1980s, but this likely involved misidentifications of young green iguanas. Others, at least the Morne Constant anole, do not grow as large today as they once did.

Species restricted to a specific habitat in relatively remote regions, infrequently visited by biologists looking for reptiles, are often virtually unknown and rarely recorded. In a review in 2017, it was found that 15 anole species only were known from their holotype. These may truly be rare and seriously threatened, as the proboscis anole, a species that only was known from a single specimen collected in 1953 until it was rediscovered in cloud forests of Ecuador in 2004. In others with few records, like the Neblina anole, this is not the case. It was initially known from six 1980s specimens from the remote Neblina highlands in Venezuela, but when the Brazilian part of these highlands were visited in 2017 it was discovered that the species was locally abundant. Some species are easily overlooked, even if common. For example, if searching for Orces&#x27; Andes anole during the night when asleep they can be fairly easy to find, but if visiting the same location during the day it can be very difficult to find any.

===As introduced species===

When introduced to regions outside their native range by humans, anoles may become invasive and represent a serious threat to small local animals. Such introductions may happen by mistake (for example, as &quot;stowaways&quot; on garden plants) or deliberately (as predators introduced to combat insects or release of pet anoles people no longer want).

In the contiguous United States, the Carolina anole has been introduced to California, the brown anole has been introduced to the Gulf Coast states and California, and the knight, Jamaican giant, bark, large-headed, Puerto Rican crested, Cuban green and Hispaniolan green anoles have been introduced to Florida. The Barbados and Morne Constant anoles have also been recorded in Florida, but do not appear to have become established. There are indications that the invasive brown anole is displacing the native Carolina anole in Florida and Texas by outcompeting it and eating its young. In the most disturbed habitats the Carolina anole may disappear entirely, but in less disturbed habitats where there is more cover (allowing young to avoid predation) it may remain fairly common, although it is forced to occur higher in trees where less visible to humans. Regardless, the Carolina anole is common and widespread overall, and it has itself been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including California, Kansas, Hawaii, Guam, Palau, the Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Anguilla, Belize, Tamaulipas in Mexico, and Japan&#x27;s Okinawa and Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands. Although there are several records from Spain (both the mainland and the Canary Islands), none of these have become established. In Japan&#x27;s Ogasawara Islands, the introduced Carolina anoles have caused declines in native lizards and diurnal insects, including the near-extinction of five endemic dragonfly species and the likely extinction of the &quot;Celastrina ogasawaraensis&quot; butterfly. This may be due to the ecological naïveté of the insects (before the introduction, there were no diurnal, highly arboreal lizards) and a very high anole density on these Japanese islands, as similar insect declines have not been reported from the Bahamas (which already had diurnal, arboreal lizards), or Guam, Saipan and Hawaii (where the anole density is lower). In addition to Florida, the Cuban green anole has been introduced to the Dominican Republic, São Paulo (Brazil) and Tenerife (Spain). In Florida and the Dominican Republic it competes with native anoles (Carolina anole and Hispaniolan green anole, respectively) and it is feared that something similar may happen in São Paulo. The same pattern can be seen in Dominica where the introduced Puerto Rican crested anole locally has displaced the endemic Dominican anole. The brown anole and Graham&#x27;s anole have both been introduced to Bermuda where they threaten the very rare Bermuda rock lizard. This problem has not been reported for the Leach&#x27;s and Barbados anoles, the other species introduced to Bermuda. In the Cayman Islands the endemic Cayman blue-throated anole has moved to higher perched in places where the introduced brown anole is present (similar to the Carolina anole in places where brown anoles are present). Outside the Americas, the brown anole has been introduced to Hawaii, Tenerife, Singapore and Taiwan, and it is able to change ant communities on the last of these islands.

<text>North Jeolla Province, officially Jeonbuk State (), is a Special Self-governing Province of South Korea in the Honam region in the southwest of the Korean Peninsula. Jeonbuk borders the provinces of South Chungcheong to the north, North Gyeongsang and South Gyeongsang to the east and South Jeolla to the south.

Jeonbuk State emerged in 1896 from the northern part of the old Jeolla province, one of the Eight Provinces of Korea. Originally North Jeolla Province, it was renamed Jeonbuk (a shortening of North Jeolla) on 18 January 2024 concurrent with the territory gaining more autonomy and being classified as self-governing rather than as a regular province. The special bill on the creation of the special autonomous province of North Jeolla is a project put forward by the People Power Party in August 2022 in accordance with Article 6 of the special law on the establishment of special autonomous provinces. 
It is the 3rd after the provinces of Jeju and Gangwon to obtain this status.

Jeonju is the capital and largest city of Jeonbuk, with other major cities including Iksan, Gunsan and Jeongeup.

Jeolla Province, including North Jeolla, was the first province/state out of the Eight Provinces system to have its 1000th year anniversary in 2018, as the name &#x27;Jeolla-do&#x27; was established in 1018,during Hyeonjong of Goryeo&#x27;s 9th year in power.

==History==
===Proto–Three Kingdoms period===
North Jeolla served as the central region of Mahan among the Samhan, housing 15 of Mahan&#x27;s total 54 tribal states.

=== Three Kingdoms period ===
During the Three Kingdom Period, this region came to belong to Baekje when it absorbed Mahan.When Baekje established the &quot;Jeongbang administrative system&quot; () to govern the local area, the central region (Goseopseong–Gobu area) acted as the core of the province.

After the fall of Baekje by the Silla and Chinese Tang dynasty allied forces in 660 (20th year of King Uija), it came under Tang control. It became a part of Silla when Tang was expelled in 676 (16th year of King Munmu).

When there were nine states and five small capitals in Unified Silla in 685, there were Wansan-ju (present Jeonju) and Namwon-gyeong (present Namwon) in Jeonbuk State in existence.

=== Later Three Kingdoms period ===
In 892, when General Kyŏn Hwŏn founded Hubaekje (later Baekje), this area was the center of the country for about 50 years. In 936, during the Hubaekje rule of Kyŏn Sin-gŏm, it was conquered by Wang Geon and became part of his Goryeo Dynasty. From 900 to the time when Hubaekje was conquered by Goryeo, Wansan-ju (present Jeonju) had been its capital, and the country ruled the whole Jeolla-do region.

=== Goryeo Dynasty ===
In 996 (14th year of King Seongjong), this region was named Gangnam province and the Korean government established the four states (Jeonju-Jeonju province, Yeongju-Gobu, Sunju-Sunchang, and Maju-Okgu) in the North Jeolla region.

Gangnam-do (Jeonbuk) and Haenam-do (South Jeolla Province) were combined and titled as Jeolla-do in 1018 (9th year of King Hyeonjong&#x27;s reign).

===Joseon Dynasty===
During the Joseon period, as the administrative districts of the whole nation were organized in the Eight Provinces system in 1413 (13th year of King Taejong&#x27;s reign), Jeolla-do took charge of vast areas of one prefecture, four autonomous counties, four protectorates, 12 counties, and 31 counties covering present Jeollanam-do, Jeollabuk-do and Jeju Province.

===Today===
In 1963, Geumsan-gun was incorporated into Chungnam, and Wido-myeon of Jeonnam was incorporated into Jeonbuk. Jeongju-eup and Namwon-eup were raised to cities in 1981 and Gimje-eup was raised to city status in 1989. Wansan District and Deokjin District were established in Jeonju-city in the same year.

Due to establishment of cities in the mixed type of city-farming area in 1995, Okgu, Jeungeup, Namwon, Gimje and Iksan-Guns were combined. Gimje and Iksan-guns were merged and Gunsan, Jeonju, Namwon, Gimje and Iri cities were integrated. Through repeated reorganizations of administrative districts, now the region consists of the administrative districts of six cities and eight counties.

Failures in the hosting of the 25th World Scout Jamboree in July 2023 led to political controversy, adding to long-term concerns about a lack of development alongside population decline and aging. As a result of a law passed in December 2023, on 18 January 2024 the North Jeolla became a special self-governing province and was renamed Jeonbuk State (Jeonbuk being an abbreviation of North Jeolla). This new status increases the autonomy of the province&#x27;s government, being able to approve projects requiring environmental impact assessments and tailor its own immigration and tourism policies.

On September 30, 2024, North Jeolla Province, alongside the Korean Heritage Service (), announced that they will be opening a multi-use cultural space institution, &quot;Godo-Hannune Iksan Sagyeyousan center/고도 한눈애(愛) 익산 세계유산센터&#x27;, or the &#x27;Iksan ancient city world heritage center&#x27;, in October 1st,2024.

<text>Leiosauridae is a family of iguanian lizards containing six genera and 34 species. The family is endemic to Central America and South America.

== Taxonomy ==
A 2022 phylogenetic study found the Leiosauridae to be the sister taxa to the Opluridae, a unique family of iguanians endemic to Madagascar, and one of only two pleurodont lineages found outside the Americas (the other being the genus &quot;Brachylophus&quot;). This called into question the previous hypothesis of Opluridae being the last members of an ancient lineage of Gondwanan iguanians, as the study found that the Leiosauridae and Opluridae only diverged during the Paleocene, about 60 million years ago. Opluridae are now thought to have colonized Madagascar via oceanic dispersal from South America, either directly or indirectly.

==Genera==
The family Leiosauridae contains the following genera:

<text>The Tropiduridae are a family of iguanid lizards. The family is sometimes considered a subfamily, Tropidurinae. The subfamily is native to South America, including the islands of Trinidad and the Galápagos. Commonly known as [[Neotropical]] ground lizards, most are ground-dwelling animals, and the subfamily includes some lizards adapted to relatively cold climates, including those of the Andes mountains and Tierra del Fuego. Several species give birth to live young.

A 2021 study described a novel escutcheon-type generation gland (&#x27;α-gland&#x27;) in tropidurines, found in at least 39 species. This gland is believed to be the main potential source of semiochemicals in this group indicating its importance in chemical signalling, an essential component of the communication system of lizards.

==Genera==
The family Tropiduridae contains the following eight genera.
*&quot;Eurolophosaurus&quot; 
*&quot;Microlophus&quot; – lava lizards and Pacific iguanas (sometimes in &quot;Tropidurus&quot;)
*&quot;Plica&quot; 
*&quot;Stenocercus&quot; – whorltail iguanas
*&quot;Strobilurus&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus&quot; (including &quot;Platynotus, Tapinurus&quot;)
*&quot;Uracentron&quot; – thornytail iguanas (sometimes in &quot;Tropidurus&quot;)
*&quot;Uranoscodon&quot;

<text>Liolaemidae are a family of iguanian lizards. They were traditionally included in the family Iguanidae as subfamily Liolaeminae, which some more recent authors prefer to delimit in a more restricted way. A common name for this group is liolaemids. Liolaemidae are typically herbivores that have a diet high in fruit. Because of this special diet, Liolaemidae have a larger small intestine when compared to other similar omnivorous and insectivorous lizards.

The genera placed here are:
* &quot;Ctenoblepharys&quot; – &quot;cabezona&quot; (one species)
* &quot;Liolaemus&quot; – tree iguanas, snow swifts (over 280 species)
* &quot;Phymaturus&quot; (52 species)

<text>The Iguanidae is a family of lizards composed of the iguanas, chuckwallas, and their prehistoric relatives, including the widespread green iguana.

== Taxonomy ==
Iguanidae is thought to be the sister group to the collared lizards (family Crotaphytidae). This family likely first appeared in Cenozoic, previously identified two Cretaceous genera (&quot;Pristiguana&quot; and &quot;Pariguana&quot;) are unlikely to belong to this family. The subfamily Iguaninae, which contains all modern genera, likely originated in the earliest Paleocene, about 62 million years ago. The most basal extant genus, &quot;Dipsosaurus,&quot; diverged from the rest of Iguaninae during the late Eocene, about 38 million years ago, with &quot;Brachylophus&quot; following a few million years later at about 35 million years ago, presumably after its dispersal event to the Pacific. All other modern iguana genera formed in the Neogene period.

A phylogenetic tree of Iguaninae is shown here:
== Description ==
Iguanas and iguana-type species are diverse in terms of size, appearance, and habitat. They typically flourish in tropical, warm climates, such as regions of South America and islands in the Caribbean and in the Pacific. Iguanas typically possess dorsal spines across their back, a dewlap on the neck, sharp claws, a long whip-like tail, and a stocky, squat build. Most iguanas are arboreal, living in trees, but some species tend to be more terrestrial, which means they prefer the ground. Iguanas are typically herbivores and their diets vary based on what plant life is available within their habitat. Iguanas across many species remain oviparious, and exhibit little to no parental care when their eggs hatch. They do, however, display nest-guarding behavior. Like all extant non-avian reptiles, they are poikilothermic, and also rely on regular periods of basking under the sun to thermoregulate.

==Distribution==
All but one of the modern iguana genera are native to the Americas, ranging from the deserts of the Southwestern United States through Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, to throughout South America down to northernmost Argentina. Some iguanas like &quot;I. iguana&quot; have spread from their native regions of Central and South America into many Pacific Islands, and even to Fiji, Japan, and Hawai&#x27;i, due to the exotic pet trade and illegal introductions into the ecosystems. Other iguanas, like the Galapagos pink iguana (&quot;C. marthae&quot;) are endemic only to specific regions on the Galapagos islands. The Grand Cayman blue iguana, &quot;C. lewisi&quot;, is endemic only to the Grand Cayman island, limited to a small wildlife reserve. The only non-American iguana species are the members of the genus &quot;Brachylophus&quot; and the extinct &quot;Lapitiguana&quot;, which are found on Fiji and formerly Tonga; their distribution is thought to be the result of the longest overwater dispersal event ever recorded for a vertebrate species, with them rafting over 8000  km across the Pacific from the Americas to the Fiji and Tonga.

==Extant genera==
==Fossils==

Cretaceous &quot;Pristiguana brasiliensis&quot; and &quot;Pariguana lancensis&quot; are later excluded from the family.

==Classification== 
Several classification schemes have been used to define the structure of this family. The &quot;historical&quot; classification recognized all New World iguanians, plus &quot;Brachylophus&quot; and the Madagascar oplurines, as informal groups and not as formal subfamilies.

Frost and Etheridge (1989) formally recognized these informal groupings as families.

Macey et al. (1997), in their analysis of molecular data for iguanian lizards recovered a monophyletic Iguanidae and formally recognized the eight families proposed by Frost and Etheridge (1989) as subfamilies of Iguanidae.

Schulte et al. (2003) reanalyzed the morphological data of Frost and Etheridge in combination with molecular data for all major groups of Iguanidae and recovered a monophyletic Iguanidae, but the subfamilies Polychrotinae and Tropidurinae were not monophyletic.

Townsend et al. (2011), Wiens et al. (2012) and Pyron et al. (2013), in the most comprehensive phylogenies published to date, recognized most groups at family level, resulting in a narrower definition of Iguanidae.

<text>South Jeolla Province (), formerly South Chŏlla Province, also known as Jeonnam (), is a province in the Honam region, South Korea, and the southernmost province in mainland Korea. South Jeolla borders the provinces of North Jeolla to the north, South Gyeongsang to the northeast, and Jeju to the southwest in the Korea Strait.

Suncheon is the largest city in the province, closely followed by Yeosu. Other major cities include Mokpo, Gwangyang and Naju.

Jeolla-do, including both North and South Jeolla, was the first province out of the Eight Provinces system to have its 1000th year anniversary in 2018, as the name &#x27;Jeolla-do&#x27; was established in 1018, during Hyeonjong of Goryeo&#x27;s 9th year in power.

==History==

=== Proto Three Kingdoms period ===
During the Samhan period, South Jeolla belonged to Mahan ()

=== Three Kingdoms period ===
In the Three Kingdoms period, it belonged to Gujihakseong () of the southern five regions of Baekje (), with Mujinju () as its center.

=== Unified Silla, North and South period ===
During the Unified Silla period, with the establishment of nine provinces and five subordinate regions, the area remained under Mujinju. In the 16th year of King Gyeongdeok&#x27;s reign (757), Mujinju was renamed to Muju () and came to oversee 15 counties (군; 郡) and 43 prefectures (군; 縣).

=== Goryeo dynasty ===
In the 2nd year of King Seongjong of Goryeo (983), when the national administrative divisions were reorganized into twelve mok (목), Naju-mok and Seungju-mok were established. In the 14th year of King Seongjong&#x27;s reign (995), with the implementation of the province (도) system, the nation was divided into ten provinces(도), and the region was called Haeyangdo (). In the 9th year of King Hyeonjong&#x27;s reign, Haeyangdo was merged with Gangnamdo, and the name Jeollado (全羅道) was officially adopted.

=== Joseon dynasty ===
During the Joseon Dynasty, the country was divided into eight provinces, and names such as Gwangnamdo (光南道), Jeongwangdo (全光道), and Jeonnamdo (全南道) were occasionally used. However, the name Jeollado was predominantly maintained. 

On May 26, 1895 (the 32nd year of King Gojong&#x27;s reign), with the implementation of the 23-bu system, Jeollado was subdivided into Jeonju-bu (全州府), Namwon-bu (南原府), Naju-bu (羅州府), and Jeju-bu (濟州府). Currently, seven cities and counties, including Suncheon and Damyang, belong to Namwon-bu, and Yeonggwang and Jangseong is part of Jeonju-bu, and the remaining sixteen cities and counties belong to Naju-bu.

On August 4, 1896 (the 33rd year of King Gojong&#x27;s reign), Decree No. 36 abolished the 23-bu system. During the reorganization process, the existing eight provinces were divided into thirteen provinces by splitting five provinces (Jeollado, Chungcheongdo, Gyeongsangdo, etc.) into northern and southern regions. As a result, Jeollado was split into north and south, with the southern part being renamed Jeollanam-do (전라남도),or South Jeolla Province, as it is known today, encompassing 1 moks(목/牧) and 32 counties (군/gun).

==Geography==
The province is part of the Honam region, and is bounded on the west by the Yellow Sea, on the north by Jeollabuk-do Province, on the south by Jeju Strait, and on the east by Gyeongsangnam-do.

There are almost 2,000 islands along the coastline, about three quarters of which are uninhabited. The coastline is about long. Some of the marine products, in particular oyster and seaweed cultivation, are leading in South Korea.

The province is only partially mountainous. The plains along the rivers Seomjin, Yeongsan and Tamjin are suitable for large-scale grain agriculture. There is abundant rainfall in the area, which helps agriculture. The province is also home to the warmest weather on the peninsula. This helps to produce large amounts of agricultural produce, mainly rice, wheat, barley, pulses and potatoes. Vegetables, cotton and fruits are also grown in the province.
===Environment===
A small amount of gold and coal is mined in the province, but industries have also been developed in the area. The amount of harmful heavy metals in the province is one-thirtieth of the environmental standard requirement, boasting clean air.

<text>Freedom of religion in Pakistan is formally guaranteed by the Constitution of Pakistan for individuals of various religions and religious sects.

Pakistan gained independence in 1947 and was founded upon the concept of two-nation theory. At the time of Pakistan&#x27;s creation the &#x27;hostage theory&#x27; had been espoused. According to this theory the Hindu minority in Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India.

Pakistan has a population estimated at 224,418,238, as of 2021. In the early 2000s, it was estimated that 96.5% of Pakistanis were Muslims (75-95% Sunni, 5-20% Shia, and 0.22-2.2% Ahmadi, who are not permitted to call themselves Muslims - see Religious discrimination in Pakistan), while the remainder are Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, members of other faiths, and agnostics and atheists.

In 2016, Sindh, Pakistan&#x27;s most religiously diverse province, with 8% religious minority population (predominantly Hindus) passed a bill that outlawed forced conversions. After being passed by the Provincial Assembly, the bill was tabled by a faction of the Pakistan Muslim League called PML-F, Pakistan Muslim League Functional, which in Sindh is led by Sufi leader Pir Pagara.

==Constitutional position==
The constitution states “all existing laws shall be brought in conformity with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.” It further states no law shall be enacted which is “repugnant” to Islam. 

The original Constitution of Pakistan did not discriminate between Muslims and non-Muslims. However, the amendments made during President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s Islamization led to the controversial Hudood Ordinance and Shariat Court. Later, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s government tried to enforce a Shariat Bill, passed in May 1991. After the incident of 9/11, Pervez Musharraf&#x27;s government took steps to curtail religious intolerance against non-Muslims.
==Blasphemy laws==
The Pakistani government does not restrict religious publishing. However, it restricts the right to freedom of speech with regard to religion. Speaking in opposition to Islam and publishing an attack on Islam or its prophets are prohibited. Pakistan&#x27;s penal code mandates the death penalty or life in prison for anyone defiling the name of Muhammad. This penal code mandates life imprisonment for desecrating the Quran, and up to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment for insulting another&#x27;s religious beliefs with intent to outrage religious feelings.

Pakistan&#x27;s blasphemy laws are problematic both in their form and their application and have been the source of much debate and harm since the 1980s. The Federal Minister for Minorities Affairs, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated on 2 March 2011 for his lifelong stand against the laws and the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was killed by his own bodyguard on 4 January 2011 for standing up for a blasphemy defendant. In Pakistan, “blasphemy” allegations are often made on the basis of little or no evidence. There is overwhelming evidence that the laws violate human rights and have encouraged people to take the law into their own hands.

Christian scriptures and books are available in Karachi and in travelling bookmobiles. Hindu and Parsi scriptures are freely available. Foreign books and magazines may be imported freely, but are subject to censorship for religious content.

In January 2023, the National Assembly of Pakistan voted to make the country’s blasphemy laws more stringent, sparking alarm among minority communities who feared it could fuel rights abuses and be used to further target religious minorities. On 17 January the National Assembly unanimously passed the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, increasing punishment for insulting the Prophet Mohammed’s companions, wives, and family members from three years to 10 years imprisonment, along with a fine of 1 million Pakistani rupees (approximately GBP £3,500).

==The Ahmadi position==
The Pakistan government does not ban formally the public practice of the Ahmadiyya, but its practice is restricted severely by law. A 1974 constitutional amendment declared Ahmadis to be a non-Muslim minority because, according to the Government, they do not accept Muhammad as the last prophet of Islam. However, Ahmadis consider themselves to be Muslims and observe Islamic practices. In 1984, under Ordinance XX the government added Section 298(c) into the Penal Code, prohibiting Ahmadis from calling themselves Muslim or posing as Muslims; from referring to their faith as Islam; from preaching or propagating their faith; from inviting others to accept the Ahmadi faith; and from insulting the religious feelings of Muslims. This section of the Penal Code has caused problems for Ahmadis, particularly the provision that forbids them from &quot;directly or indirectly&quot; posing as Muslims. The Ahmadis must not use the standard Muslim greeting form and must not name their children Muhammad. The constitutionality of Section 286(c) was upheld in a split-decision Supreme Court case in 1996. The punishment for violation of this section is imprisonment for up to 3 years and a fine. It has been alleged that this provision has been used extensively by the Government and anti-Ahmadi religious groups to target and harass Ahmadis. Ahmadis also are prohibited from holding any conferences or gatherings.

==Electoral process for non-Muslims==
In 1980s Zia ul-Haq introduced a system under which non-Muslims could vote for only candidates of their own religion. Seats were reserved for minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Government officials stated that the separate electorates system is a form of affirmative action designed to ensure minority representation, and that efforts are underway to achieve a consensus among religious minorities on this issue. But critics argue that under this system Muslim candidates no longer had any incentive to pay attention to the minorities. Pakistan&#x27;s separate electoral system for different religions has been described as &#x27;political Apartheid&#x27;. Hindu community leader Sudham Chand protested against the system but was murdered. In 1999, Pakistan abolished this system.

==Legal and personal freedom for non-Muslims==
The judicial system encompasses several different court systems with overlapping and sometimes competing jurisdiction, reflecting differences in civil, criminal, and Islamic jurisprudence. The federal sharia court and the sharia bench of the Supreme Court serve as appellate courts for certain convictions in criminal court under the Hudood Ordinances, and judges and attorneys in these courts must be Muslims. The federal sharia court also may overturn any legislation judged to be inconsistent with the tenets of Islam. Discrimination against religious minorities in Pakistan is embedded in the very structure of the constitution. Much has been written on the fact that the offices of President and Prime Minister are reserved for Muslims only.

The Hudood Ordinances criminalize non-marital rape, extramarital sex, and various gambling, alcohol, and property offences. The Hudood Ordinances are applied to Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Some Hudood Ordinance cases are subject to Hadd, or Quranic, punishment; others are subject to Tazir, or secular punishment.

Although both types of cases are tried in ordinary criminal courts, special rules of evidence apply in Hadd cases, which discriminate against non-Muslims. For example, a non-Muslim may testify only if the victim also is non-Muslim. Likewise, the testimony of women, Muslim or non-Muslim, is not admissible in cases involving Hadd punishments. Crimes like theft and rape which do not satisfy the conditions of punishments under &quot;hadd&quot;, are instead punished under the tazir system. A non-Muslim convicted of zina cannot be stoned under the hudood ordinance.

Christian Church leaders argue that the government needs to go beyond the rhetoric of &quot;minorities are enjoying all rights in the country&quot; and take practical steps to ensure that this is done. 
According to a survey in 2010 by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, 76% of Pakistanis polled supported the death penalty for those who leave Islam.

==Sexual freedom==
The Penal Code incorporates a number of Islamic law provisions. The judicial system encompasses several different court systems with overlapping and sometimes competing jurisdictions that reflect differences in civil, criminal, and Islamic jurisprudence. The Federal Shari&#x27;a Court and the Shari&#x27;a bench of the Supreme Court serve as appellate courts for certain convictions in criminal court under the Hudood Ordinance, which criminalizes rape, extramarital sex, property crimes, alcohol, and gambling; judges and attorneys in these courts must be Muslim. The Federal Shari&#x27;a Court may overturn any legislation judged inconsistent with the tenets of Islam. In March 2005, however, the Supreme Court Chief Justice ruled that the Federal Shari&#x27;a Court had no jurisdiction to review a decision by a provincial high court even if the Federal Shari&#x27;a Court should have had initial appellate jurisdiction.

For both Muslims and non-Muslims, all consensual extramarital sexual relations are considered a violation of the Hudood Ordinances. If a woman cannot prove the absence of consent in a rape case, there is a risk that she may be charged with a violation of the Hudood Ordinances for fornication or adultery. The maximum punishment for this offence is public flogging or stoning. However, there are no recorded instances of either type of punishment since the law was introduced.

According to a police official , in a majority of rape cases, the victims are pressured to drop rape charges because of the threat of Hudood adultery charges being brought against them. A parliamentary commission of inquiry for women has criticized the Hudood Ordinances and recommended their repeal. It also has been charged that the laws on adultery and rape have been subject to widespread misuse, and that 95 percent of the women accused of adultery are found innocent in the court of first instance or on appeal. This commission found that the main victims of the Hudood Ordinances are poor women who are unable to defend themselves against slanderous charges. According to the commission, the laws also have been used by husbands and other male family members to punish their wives and female family members for reasons that have nothing to do with perceived sexual impropriety. Approximately one-third or more of the women in jails in Lahore, Peshawar, and Mardan in 1998 were awaiting trial for adultery under the Hudood Ordinances.

However, a major amendment was passed to fix and/or get rid of these archaic laws. The Woman&#x27;s Protection Bill passed in 2006. It returned a number of offences from the Zina Ordinance to the Pakistan Penal Code, where they had been before 1979, and created an entirely new set of procedures governing the prosecution of the offences of adultery and fornication, whipping and amputation were removed as punishments. The law meant women would not be jailed if they were unable to prove rape, and allows rape to be proved on grounds other than witnesses, such as forensics and DNA evidence.

==Forced conversion==

According to Minorities Concern of Pakistan, forced conversion of Christian and Hindu girls are on the rise in Pakistan. Three international Christian organizations are planning to raise their voice on this issue in the UN.
In Pakistan approximately 1000 girls from religious minority communities are forced to convert to Islam on yearly basis. Pakistani authorities have consistently failed to respond to numerous appeals to effectively tackle the persistent violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion or faith. This includes a wide range of instances where religious minority groups have been subjected to oppression and discrimination.

==Ministry of Religious Affairs==
The Ministry of Religious Affairs, which is entrusted with safeguarding religious freedom, has on its masthead a Koranic verse: &quot;Islam is the only religion acceptable to God.&quot; The Ministry claims that it spends 30 percent of its annual budget to assist indigent minorities, to repair minority places of worship, to set up minority-run small development schemes, and to celebrate minority festivals. However, religious minorities question its expenditures, observing that localities and villages housing minority citizens go without basic civic amenities. The National Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP) of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference, using official budget figures for expenditures in 1998, calculated that the Government actually spent $17 (PRs 850) on each Muslim and only $3.20 (PRs 160) on each religious minority citizen per month.
Religious minority interests have also been represented by a Minorities Ministry, which has taken various forms and now sits under the Religious Affairs Ministry again, since June 2013.

==International Views==
On 23 September 2009, the United States House of Representatives introduced a &quot;House Resolution 764&quot; which calls on Pakistan to restore religious freedom in the country where Hindus, Christians, Ahmadiyyas and Baháʼís (the religions mentioned by name) are subjugated. The resolution was introduced by Representative Chris Smith. As of December 2016, the resolution failed.

In 2018, Pakistan was seen as one of the top 5 countries with the highest levels of social hostilities involving religion, along with India, Nigeria, Egypt and Bangladesh.

In 2022, Freedom House rated Pakistan’s religious freedom as 1 out of 4, noting that the blasphemy laws are often exploited by religious vigilantes and also curtail the freedom of expression by Christians and Muslims, especially Ahmadis. Hindus and Christians have spoken of vulnerability to kidnapping and forced conversions.

<text>Cabinet (or CAB) is an archive-file format for Microsoft Windows that supports lossless data compression and embedded digital certificates used for maintaining archive integrity. Cabinet files have codice_1 filename extensions and are recognized by their first four bytes (also called their &quot;magic number&quot;) &quot;MSCF&quot;. Cabinet files were known originally as Diamond files.

== Design ==

A CAB archive can contain up to 65,535 &quot;folders&quot; (distinct from standard operating system directories), each of which can contain up to 65,535 files for a maximum of 4,294,836,225. Internally, each folder is treated as a single compressed block, which provides more efficient compression than individually compressing each file.

Every entry in a folder has to be a file. Due to this structure, it is not possible to store empty folders in CAB archives.

The following shows an example a CAB file structure, demonstrating the relationship between folders and files:
* CAB file
** First folder
*** 
** Second folder
*** 
How paths should be handled is not specified in the CAB file format, leaving it to the software implementation:

* Some affix file paths to filenames only, as if all files in a CAB archive are in a single folder. IExpress works this way, as does Microsoft Windows Explorer, which can open CAB archives as a folder.
* Some can store the paths, and upon extraction, create folders as necessary. and (tools from Microsoft Cabinet SDK) as well as and (third-party open-source tools) work this way.
* , only since version 6 (which is included from Windows Vista to above) can extract files to their paths. The previous versions don&#x27;t do it.

The CAB file format may employ the following compression algorithms:

* DEFLATE: invented by Phil Katz, the author of the ZIP file format (specifically, the MSZIP encapsulation)
* Quantum compression: licensed from David Stafford, the author of the Quantum archiver (not available in all versions of makecab.exe/diamond.exe)
* LZX: invented by Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen, given to Microsoft when Forbes joined the company
* NULL: stored

A CAB archive can reserve empty spaces in the archive as well as for each file in the archive, for some application-specific uses like digital signatures or arbitrary data.

== Implementations ==
Microsoft Windows supports creating CAB archive files using the codice_2 command-line utility. It supports extracting the contents of a CAB archive files using File Explorer, Setup API, and using the command-line commands codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5.

Other well-known software with CAB archive support includes WinZip, WinRAR or 7-Zip. The aforementioned codice_6 is a common tool for Linux systems, but is only capable of extracting archives. The codice_7 tool however can both extract and create CAB archives. For a full list, see .

== Uses ==

A variety of Microsoft installation technologies use the CAB format: these include Windows Installer, Windows Setup (from Windows 95 to Windows Server 2003), Setup API, Device Installer, Theme Pack and AdvPack (used by Internet Explorer to install ActiveX components). CAB files are also often associated with self-extracting programs like IExpress where the executable program extracts the associated CAB file. CAB files are also sometimes embedded into other files. For example, MSI and MSU files usually include one or more embedded CAB files.

Windows uses the cabinet format to archive its Component-Based Servicing (CBS) log, which is kept in the folder . A bug in the compression process can cause run-away generation of useless log files both in that folder and in , which can consume disk storage until completely filling the hard drive. Deletion of the files without following a specific procedure can cause the deleted files to be regenerated at an increased pace.

On Linux systems, CAB archives are used by fwupd to distribute firmware updates from hardware vendors that can be flashed on non-volatile memory.

== Related formats ==

The codice_1 filename extension is also used by other installer programs (e.g. InstallShield) for their own proprietary archiving formats. InstallShield uses zlib for compression (see Deflate), but their headers are not the same as for Microsoft CAB files so they are incompatible and cannot be manipulated or edited with the programs that are made for standard cabinet format. Specialized third-party utilities, such as Unshield, can extract this specific proprietary format. This format has a different magic number of .

Windows CE software is distributed as CAB files where the first file inside, ending with extension &quot;.000&quot;, details how it is installed.

Microsoft Installer codice_9 files sometimes &quot;contain&quot; CAB files, but are themselves in the Compound File Binary Format which has to be decoded first. Software like codice_10 can be used to unpack these files.

Microsoft Publisher has a &quot;Pack and Go&quot; feature that bundles a publisher document, together with all external links, into a CAB file with a codice_11 extension. These files are meant to be activated with a companion .EXE file which is distributed along with the codice_11 file. These files may be opened with any CAB file extraction program.

<doc id="322680" wikidata="Q17059284" url="?curid=322680" title="Freedom of religion in Sudan">
<text>The 2019 transitional constitution of Sudan guarantees freedom of religion and omits reference to sharia as a source of law, unlike the 2005 constitution of Sudan&#x27;s deposed president Omar al-Bashir whose government had criminalized apostasy and blasphemy against Islam. Bashir&#x27;s government had also targeted Shia Muslims and those engaging in proselytization to faiths other than Islam. Christians had also faced restrictions in matters of religious freedom.

Apostasy from Islam was decriminalized in July 2020, whereas previously those found guilty of apostasy could face the death penalty. In September 2020, the interim government established the separation of religion and state.

== Religious demographics ==
The country has an area of and a population of 40.2 million. Demographic data are estimates. Two-thirds to three-fourths of the population live in the 15 states of the north, and are generally from Arabic speakers. The remaining one-fourth to one-third of the population live in the south, and are primarily Nilotic peoples. An estimated 70 percent of the population is Muslim. Islam predominates in the north. Almost all Muslims are Sunni, although there are significant distinctions between followers of different Sunni traditions (particularly among Sufi brotherhoods).

An estimated 25 percent of the population holds traditional indigenous beliefs (animism), which are prevalent in rural areas throughout the country. Some animists have been baptized but do not identify themselves as Christians, or they combine Christian and animist practices. Christians are the third largest religious group, traditionally concentrated in the south and the Nuba Mountains. Widespread displacement and migration during the long civil war increased the population of Christians living in the north. While many Christians have returned to the south, Khartoum still has a significant Christian population. The Roman Catholic Church of Sudan and the Episcopal Churches of Sudan estimate they have six million and five million baptized followers, respectively, although active churchgoers are far fewer.
The Presbyterian Church in Sudan is the third largest denomination in Sudan.

There are small but long-established groups of Orthodox Christians (including Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox) in Khartoum and other northern cities. There are also Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox communities in Khartoum and the east, largely made up of refugees and migrants. Other Christian groups with smaller followings include the Africa Inland Church, Armenian (Apostolic) Church, Sudan Church of Christ, Sudan Interior Church, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Sudan Pentecostal Church, Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church (in the north), Presbyterian Church of the Sudan (in the south), and the Seventh-day Adventist Church of Sudan.

Religion plays a prominent role in a complex system of political alliances. Northern Muslims have dominated the political and economic system since independence in 1956. Since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005, the GNU has appointed both Muslims and Christians to prominent executive positions. The dominant political power in Sudan, the National Congress Party (NCP), draws its support from conservative Arab Muslims in the north. Its previous incarnation, the National Islamic Front, ruled from 1989 to 1998. Northern opposition parties draw their support from Sufi brotherhoods: the Umma Party is closely connected with Arab followers of the Ansar sect, and the Democratic Unionist Party with the Khatmia sect. Opposition parties typically include non-Arab Muslims from the north, east, and Darfur. Following the civil war the Sudanese People&#x27;s Liberation Movement (SPLM) became the dominant political power in the south, and is the main coalition partner with the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) in the GNU. The SPLM draws its support from Southern Christians, but regularly engages with Muslim opposition parties and rebel groups in Darfur and the east.

== Status ==
The INC provides for freedom of religion throughout the entire country, but disparities in the legal treatment of religious minorities exist between the north and south. The INC preserves Shari&#x27;a as a source of legislation in the north. The Constitution of Southern Sudan provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies of the GoSS contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The INC and the Constitution of Southern Sudan both deny recognition to any political party which discriminates on the basis of religion. There are no legal remedies to address constitutional violations of religious freedom by government or private individuals.

Although there is no penalty for converting from another religion to Islam, converting from Islam to another religion was punishable by imprisonment or death in the north until 2020; however, a death sentence for apostasy had never been carried out.
The government supports Islam by providing funds for mosque construction throughout the north; it also exerts influence over the established Muslim hierarchy by retaining the right to appoint and dismiss imams in most northern mosques. Blasphemy and defaming religion are punishable by imprisonment in the north, although these restrictions are rarely enforced. Authorities in the north occasionally subject converts to scrutiny, ostracism and intimidation, or encourage them to leave the country. In the south, there are no penalties for apostasy, blasphemy, or defaming religion; proselytizing is common.

The government had codified limited aspects of Shari&#x27;a law into criminal and civil law, with penalties dependent on the religion of the accused. For instance, the consumption of alcohol is punishable by 40 lashes for a Muslim and 20 for a Christian; however, there were no reports of this punishment being implemented during the reporting period. The GNU observes both Muslim and Christian holidays, including Eid al-Adha, the Islamic New Year, the Birthday of Muhammad, Coptic Easter, Israa Wal Mi&#x27;Raaj, Eid ul-Fitr and Christmas. In the south, GoSS offices do not observe Islamic holy days. Religious groups are required by law to register with the government as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), although this requirement is not enforced. Religious organizations must register as nongovernmental, nonprofit organizations to claim exemption from taxes and import duties. All religious groups must obtain permits from the national Ministry of Guidance and Social Endowments, the state Ministry of Construction and Planning, and the local planning office before constructing new houses of worship.

Shari&#x27;a apostasy penalties within the legal code limited Christian missionary activities in the north, and the government customarily delayed the issuance of visas to foreigners with affiliations to international faith-based organizations for long periods. The GoSS does not restrict the presence of foreign missionaries, and does not require them to register. Under the state-mandated curriculum, all schools in the north are required to teach Islamic-education classes from preschool through university. All classes must be taught in Arabic, although English may be taught as a foreign language. Public schools are not required to provide any religious instruction to non-Muslims, and some public schools excuse non-Muslims from Islamic-education classes. Private schools must hire a special teacher for teaching Islamic education, even in Christian schools. Christian leaders cite these requirements as exacerbating problems in the relationship between the Muslim majority and the Christian minority, marginalizing Christianity&#x27;s place in northern society.

National government offices and businesses in the north follow the Islamic workweek, with Friday as a day of prayer. Employers are required by law to give their Christian employees two hours before 10:00 a.m. on Sunday for religious purposes; in practice many employers do not, and there was no legal remedy. Public schools are in session on Sunday; Christian students are not excused from classes. Most Christians adapt by worshiping on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday evenings. GoSS offices and businesses in the south follow the Monday-through-Friday workweek, with Sunday a day of religious observance. Employers in the south generally do not give their Muslim employees two hours on Friday for religious purposes, as required under law in the north. Schools in the south are in session on Friday, and Muslim students are not excused from class.

The Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005 (CPA) mandated the creation of a Commission for the Rights of Non-Muslims in the National Capital, a mechanism designed to advise the courts on how to fairly apply Shari&#x27;a to non-Muslims. The commission (with representatives from Muslim, Christian, and traditional religious groups) met several times during the reporting period. Although it made little headway in changing official government policy towards non-Muslims in Khartoum, the commission created a forum for dialogue on religious matters that was previously nonexistent; it obtained release or leniency for some non-Muslims arrested for violating Shari&#x27;a law.

==Restrictions==
Although the government generally does not vigorously enforce its strictest restrictions on religious freedom, it tends not to respect religious plurality in the north. The GoSS generally respects religious freedom in practice, and pursued policies that contributed to the generally free practice of religion during the period covered by the report. The government favored Muslims over Christians in the north, in part by funding the construction of mosques but not churches. Many southern Christians living in the north are economic migrants and due to many factors, they suffer from social, educational, and job discrimination. Overwhelmingly Muslim in composition, the ruling NCP favors members of its political and tribal groups. Opposition political parties, often composed of adherents of Sufi sects and non-Arab northern Muslims, are excluded from the political process and national policymaking. Although the INC and the Constitution of Southern Sudan specifically prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion for candidates for the national civil service, the selection process favors party members and friends of the NCP.

Permits for new mosques in the north are generally issued, and three new churches were under construction in Khartoum. However, many Muslim and Christian religious leaders complain that the permit process is cumbersome and time-consuming. The GoSS did not appear to require permits for the construction and rehabilitation of mosques and churches. The government restricts foreigners from entering the country for Christian missionary work, but it allows foreign Christian religious leaders to enter in support of their local congregations. The Humanitarian Affairs Committee expelled foreign workers of international aid organizations, although several US-based Christian aid organizations maintained operations throughout the north.

The National Intelligence and Security Service monitors religious activities at mosques and churches throughout the country, often posing as members of the congregation. Christian leaders acknowledge that they usually refrain from preaching on political or other sensitive topics; some Muslim imams avoid political topics in their preaching as well. The GoSS does not appear to monitor religious activities at mosques or churches in the south. In a 25 July 2007 interview with the Saudi Arabian newspaper &quot;Okaz&quot;, the Minister of Defense, Abdel Rahim Mohammed Hussein, claimed that &quot;24 Jewish organizations&quot; were fueling the conflict in Darfur. Anti-Semitic rhetoric is common in both official media and statements by NCP officials.

== Abuses ==
There were a few reports that security forces regularly harassed and, at times, used threats and violence against individuals because of their religious beliefs and activities; however, such reports continued to decrease during the period covered by this report. In June 2001, Aladin Omer Agabani Mohammed, a Khartoum resident, was arrested for converting from Islam to Christianity and detained incommunicado for three months; he reportedly was tortured. In September 2001, he was released on medical grounds, but was required to report daily to the security forces. In January and February 2002, security police again harassed Aladin, put him under surveillance, and refused his requests to travel because he had converted to Christianity. On 30 January 2002, airport authorities refused to allow Aladin to board a plane to Uganda to study at St. Paul Theology Seminary, although he had received his visas and military exemption; the authorities reportedly told him that he was an apostate abandoning Islam.

== Current situation ==

The government&#x27;s approach towards religious minorities allegedly continued to improve. It toned down public rhetoric aimed at religious minorities, permitted the publication and distribution of Christian newspapers in the north, and allowed a church to broadcast religious radio programming from Khartoum. Unlike prior reporting periods, the government did not engage in severe abuses of religious freedom. The National Assembly, the Council of States, and the Cabinet feature both Muslims and Christians in prominent roles. The government sought alliances with local Christian leaders, funding site improvements for Khartoum&#x27;s Catholic cathedral.

In April 2008, a delegation of the World Council of Churches toured the country, met with government officials in the north and GoSS officials in the south, and hosted a large nondenominational Christian festival in Juba. Unlike prior reporting periods, some of Khartoum&#x27;s English-language newspapers featured lengthy articles on Christian themes. In the south, Muslim religious leaders reported less interreligious tension during the reporting period.

Other sources disagree.


In July 2020, during the 2019–2021 Sudanese transition to democracy, Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari stated that &quot;all the laws violating the human rights in Sudan&quot; were to be scrapped. For this reason, Parliament had passed laws in early July 2020 abolishing the punishment for apostasy for Muslims (Article 126 of the Sudanese Penal Code), the prohibition on alcohol for non-Muslims, the need for women to obtain permission from a male relative to travel, and flogging as a form of punishment. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) applauded the reforms on 15 July 2020, but urged Sudanese lawmakers to repeal the blasphemy law (Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code) as well. On September 4, 2020, the interim government signed a declaration formally separating religion and state.

In 2022, Sudan was ranked as the 10th most dangerous country to be a Christian.

== Social attitudes ==
Muslims in the north who express an interest in Christianity or convert to Christianity faced severe social pressure to recant.
Some universities continued to pressure women to wear headscarves to classes, although social pressure for women to wear headscarves in public in the north decreased overall. The government arrested, detained, and charged 16 people in connection with the September 2006 killing of Mohamed Taha, the Shi&#x27;a editor-in-chief of the &quot;al-Wafaq&quot; daily newspaper, who published a controversial article about the origins of Muhammad.

<text>&#x27; (from German &#x27; &quot;to swing&quot;), also known asSwiss wrestling(French&#x27;) and natively (and colloquially) as &quot; ([[Swiss German]] for &quot;breeches-lifting&quot;), is a style of [[folk wrestling]] native to Switzerland, more specifically the [[Prealps|pre-alpine]] parts of [[German-speaking Switzerland]]. Wrestlers wear&#x27; (&quot;wrestling breeches&quot;) with belts that are used for taking holds. Throws and trips are common because the first person to pin his or her opponent&#x27;s shoulders to the ground wins the bout.

Schwingen is considered a &quot;national sport&quot; of Switzerland, alongside Hornussen and Steinstossen. Schwingen and Steinstossen were included as &quot;Nationalturnen&quot; (&quot;national gymnastics&quot;) in the &quot;Eidgenössisches Turnfest&quot; at Lausanne in 1855.

The modern history of organized &quot;Schwingen&quot; tournaments begins with the Unspunnenfest of 1805.

==History==

As with other types of folk wrestling, the roots of Schwingen in Switzerland cannot be determined exactly. The modern sport was institutionalized in the 19th century out of older, regional traditions.

There are records of wrestling in Switzerland from the medieval period. A picture from the 13th century (in the Cathedral of Lausanne) shows the typical way of gripping the opponent.

Schwingen as a special form of grappling in Alpine culture can be traced to the early, 17th century. This form of grappling is preserved during the 17th and 18th century in the Emmental, Haslital and Entlebuch regions specifically. In 18th century travel literature, Schwingen figures as part of the stereotypes of Swiss alpine culture. The Entlebuch pastor Franz Josef Stalder in 1797 records a set of rules in his &quot;Fragmente über Entlebuch&quot;.

The modern history of the sport begins during the period of Mediation, with the Unspunnenfest of 1805. In the late 19th century, memorable Schwing festivals and a lively activity of educated gymnastics teachers brought Schwingen to the big cities. Thus the original fight of the herders and farmers became a national sport that reached all social levels. The associations, headed by the &quot;Eidgenössischer Schwingerverband&quot; (national federation, founded 1895), organized the sport by integrating regional peculiarities, improving the abilities of the fighters with teaching books and practices, and creating modern tournament rules.

In 2020 Curdin Orlik became the first athlete in the sport of Schwingen to come out as gay, and also the first openly gay male active in Swiss professional sports.

==Tournament==
The match takes place in a ring, a circular area with a diameter of 12 meters that is covered with sawdust. The two opponents wear short pants made of jute over their clothes. The wrestlers hold each other by these pants, at the back where the belt meets, and try to throw the opponent onto his back. There are several main throws, with names like &quot;kurz&quot;, &quot;übersprung&quot; and &quot;wyberhaagge&quot;, some of them very similar to judo techniques - &quot;hüfter&quot; is almost identical to koshi guruma, &quot;brienzer&quot; is basically uchi mata. These throws are found in many wrestling systems that have even the slightest emphasis on throwing the opponent, and can also been seen in shuaijiao. A match is won when the winner holds the opponent&#x27;s pants with at least one hand and both the opponent&#x27;s shoulders touch the ground. By tradition the winner brushes the sawdust off the loser&#x27;s back after the match.

The match is judged by three referees, one of whom stands in the ring. The referees give points, with a maximum of ten points for a winning throw. If the match ends without a clear win, the more active Schwinger is awarded the higher number of points.

At a Schwing festival, every Schwinger wrestles six opponents, or eight at the Eidgenössische. The two Schwingers with the highest number of points after five (seven at the Eidgenössische) matches get to the Schlussgang (last round). The matching of the Schwingers is done by the &quot;fight court&quot; according to arcane rules. Often there are suspicions that the matchings have not been fair, and favor one contestant over the others.

There are no weight classes nor any other categories. Usually, though, Schwingers are big men, over 180 cm tall and weighing in excess of 100 kg, and are mostly craftsmen from traditional professions that require some physical force, like carpenters, butchers, lumberjacks or cheesemakers.

Regional and cantonal Schwing festivals are held outdoors, between early summer and autumn.

The most important Schwing festival is the &quot;Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest&quot;, which takes place every three years. The winner of this tournament is proclaimed &quot;Schwingerkönig&quot; and receives a bull as his prize.

==Traditions==

Traditionally, Schwingen is a male sport. Women&#x27;s Schwingen is a more recent phenomenon, and the &quot;Frauenschwingverband&quot;, or Women&#x27;s Schwingen Association, was founded in 1992.

Members of a pure Schwingen club are called &quot;Sennenschwinger&quot; and wear dark trousers and a colored shirt, usually bright blue. Members of a broader sports club with a Schwingen section are called &quot;Turnerschwinger&quot;, and wear white pants and a white T-shirt.

Advertising and sponsoring are shunned at Schwingen. Successful Schwingers do not receive cash prizes, but goods such as cowbells, furniture or livestock.

The best Schwingers at a festival are awarded a wreath. Schwingers who receive a wreath at an &quot;Eidgenössische&quot; or national tournament are called &quot;Eidgenossen&quot; (confederates). Good Schwingers at national level are called &quot;Böse&quot; (wicked).

A winner of the &quot;Eidgenössische&quot; is given the lifetime title of &quot;Schwingerkönig&quot; (Schwinger king), which includes some privileges such as being a guest of honor at every &quot;Eidgenössische&quot;.

<text>Glíma (anglicised as Glima) is an Icelandic sport for combat and is categorised as Nordic folk wrestling. The most common form of glima describe players gripping their opponent by the waist and attempt to throw them to the ground using technique rather than force. Other variants allow for more aggression.

== History ==
The original settlers in Iceland took wrestling with them, and these combat systems have been used by the populace according to the Jónsbók law book from 1325. A modern trouser-grip glima competition was first held in Iceland in 1888 and has been held almost every year since. In 1905 the belt was introduced so that the wrestlers could have a better grip on each other. Before that they held on to each other&#x27;s trousers. In 1906 the first competition for the &quot;Belt of Grettir&quot; was held where the winners are named &quot;The Glima King&quot;. In the 1912 Summer Olympics there was a demonstration of modern trouser-grip glima.

== Variants ==

=== Trouser-grip wrestling ===
The trouser-grip (&quot;brókartök&quot;) version is by far the most widespread in Iceland and is Iceland&#x27;s national sport. It favours technique over strength. The wrestlers wear a special belt around the waist and additional belts on the lower thighs of each leg, which connect to the main belt. A fixed grip is then taken with one hand in the belt and the other in the trousers at thigh height. From this position the glima-wrestler attempts to trip and throw his opponent. In this style of glima, a thrown wrestler may attempt to land on his feet and hands and if he succeeds in doing so he has not lost the fall. The winning condition in this type of glima is to make the opponent touch the ground with an area of the body between the elbow and the knee.

There are four points that differentiate it from other forms of wrestling:
*The opponents must always stand erect.
*The opponents step clockwise around each other (looks similar to a waltz). This is to create opportunities for offence and defence, and to prevent a stalemate.
*It is not permitted to fall down on your opponent or to push him down in a forceful manner, as it is not considered sportsman-like.
*The opponents are supposed to look across each other&#x27;s shoulders as much as possible because it is considered proper to wrestle by touch and feel rather than sight.

The core of the system are eight main techniques, which form the basic training for approximately 50 ways to execute a throw or takedown.

Surrounding glima is a code of honour called &quot;drengskapur&quot; that calls for fairness, respect for and caring about the security of one&#x27;s training partners.

The word &quot;glíma&quot; is the Icelandic term for &quot;wrestling&quot; in general. The same word has also a wider meaning of &quot;struggle&quot;.

Glima differs from other ethnic wrestling styles in three ways:

* Upright position – The contestants must remain upright. The body position in many other ethnic wrestling styles is often bent over at the waist, but in glima this is called ousting and is banned.
* Stepping – Glima involves the contestants constantly stepping back and forth in a clockwise direction. This stepping—&quot;stígandi&quot;—is one of the characteristics of glima and is designed to avoid a standstill and create opportunities for offence and attack.
* A ban on knocking over – It is forbidden to push your opponent down with force. This is considered to be unsportsmanlike and in opposition to the nature of glima as a sport for honorable sportsmen and women. Opponents should be conquered by using a well implemented grip that makes the opponent fall gracefully to the ground without any further action.

=== Backhold wrestling ===
Backhold wrestling (&quot;hryggspenna&quot;) is more similar to other styles of wrestling and is considered to be more a test of strength than of technique. In backhold wrestling the opponents take hold of each other&#x27;s upper body; whoever touches the ground with any part of the body except the feet has lost.

=== Loose-grip wrestling ===
In loose-grip wrestling (&quot;lausatök&quot;) the contestants may use any holds they wish.

It is much more aggressive and differs in many ways from other styles of glima. Loose-grip wrestling comes in two forms: A version for self-defence and a version for friendly competition. In both, all kinds of wrestling techniques are allowed, but in the friendly version they are still taught to be executed in a way so they won&#x27;t cause the opponent injury. In such a friendly match, the winner is considered the one who is still standing while the other is lying on the ground. This means that if both the opponents fall to the ground together, the match will continue on the ground by the use of techniques to keep the other down while getting up yourself.

Even more divergent from other forms of glima is loose-grip glima when trained purely for self-defence. In such training the harmful and hurtful techniques or ways of executing the techniques, that are not accepted in other forms of glima, are explored in as free and creative a way as possible while not injuring one&#x27;s training partners.

This form of glima is practised at the Norwegian Glima Championship and Lausatök Combat Glima Finland.

<text>Systema () is a Russian martial art. There are multiple schools of systems that began appearing after the end of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, with teachers claiming their respective &quot;systems&quot; (usually named after themselves). Training includes, but is not limited to: hand-to-hand combat, grappling, knife fighting, and firearms training. Training involves drills and sparring without set &quot;kata&quot;.

<doc id="322687" wikidata="Q5500786" url="?curid=322687" title="Freedom of religion in Mauritania">
<text>Freedom of religion in Mauritania is limited by the Government. The constitution establishes the country as an Islamic republic and decrees that Islam is the religion of its citizens and the State.

Non-Muslim resident expatriates and a few non-Muslim citizens practice their religion openly with certain limitations on proselytization and transmission of religious materials.

Relations between the Muslim community and the small non-Muslim community are generally amicable.

== Religious demography ==
Officially, 100% of Mauritanian citizens are Muslim. In reality, 99.1% are Sunni Muslims, although there are a few non-Muslims (approximately 0.9%). Roman Catholic and non-denominational Christian churches have been established in Nouakchott, Atar, Zouerate, Nouadhibou and Rosso, but are not open to local citizens. A number of expatriates practice Judaism but there are no synagogues.

== Status of religious freedom ==
Islam is generally considered to be the essential cohesive element unifying the country&#x27;s various ethnic groups and castes. There is a cabinet-level Ministry of Culture and Islamic Orientation and a High Council of Islam, consisting of six imams, which, at the Government&#x27;s request, advises on the conformance of legislation to Islamic precepts.

Mosques and Qur&#x27;anic schools are funded privately by their members and other donors. One exception is a small stipend to the imam of the Central Mosque in the capital city of Nouakchott provided by the government.

The Government does not register religious groups; however, secular NGOs, inclusive of humanitarian and development NGO&#x27;s affiliated with religious groups, must register with the Ministry of the Interior.

Nonprofit organizations, including both religious groups and secular NGO&#x27;s, generally are not subject to taxation.

The judiciary consists of a single system of courts with a legal system that conforms with the principles of Shari&#x27;a (Islamic law).

The Government observes Muslim holidays as national holidays. A magistrate of Shari&#x27;a, who heads a separate government commission, decides the dates for observing religious holidays and addresses the nation on these holidays.

== Restrictions on religious freedom ==
There is no religious oath required of government employees or members of the ruling political party, except for the President and the members of the 5-person Constitutional Council and the 10-person High Council of Magistrates presided over by the President. The Constitutional Council and the High Council of Magistrates advise the President in matters of law and the Constitution. The oath of office includes a promise to God to uphold the law of the land in conformity with Islamic precepts.

All schools except international schools are required to provide four hours of Islam education every week. Students completing the Baccalaureate exam must complete religious education in Arabic. 

There are several foreign faith-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) active in humanitarian and developmental work in the country. New laws in 2021 make it easier for faith-based NGOs to register and operate, but they are not allowed to proselytise or promote non-Islamic religions. 

In April 2018, the National Assembly passed a law making the death penalty mandatory for &quot;blasphemy&quot;. This follows laws which give the death penalty for adultery and homosexual activity, although these penalties have not been used since the 1980s. 

==Proselytization to Muslims==
Although there is no specific legal prohibition against proselytizing by non-Muslims, in practice the Government prohibits proselytizing by non-Muslims through the use of Article 11 of the Press Act, which bans the publication of any material that is against Islam or contradicts or otherwise threatens Islam. The Government views any attempts by practitioners of other religions to convert Muslims as undermining society. Foreign faith-based NGO&#x27;s limit their activities to humanitarian and development assistance. In June 2009 American aid worker Chris Leggett was murdered for allegedly proselytizing, according to the Barnabas Fund.

===Possession and distribution of Bibles===
Under Article 11 of the Press Law, the Government may restrict the importation, printing, or public distribution of Bibles or other non-Islamic religious literature, and in practice Bibles are neither printed nor publicly sold in the country. However, the possession of Bibles and other non-Islamic religious materials in private homes is legal.

Shari&#x27;a provides the legal principles upon which the law and legal procedure are based. Mauritania follows the Maliki madhab, which has certain unique laws not applicable to other madhabs.

==International Views==
In 2022 Freedom House rated Mauritanian religious freedom as 2 out of 4, noting that while apostasy is a crime punishable by death, to date, no one has been executed for the crime. However, in April 2018, parliament passed a new law that strengthens the existing death penalty punishment for certain blasphemy offenses.

<text>7-Zip is a free and open-source file archiver, a utility used to place groups of files within compressed containers known as &quot;archives&quot;. It is developed by Igor Pavlov and was first released in 1999. 7-Zip has its own archive format called 7z introduced in 2001, but can read and write several others.

The program can be used from a Windows graphical user interface that also features shell integration, from a Windows command-line interface as the command codice_1 or codice_2, and from POSIX systems as codice_3. Most of the 7-Zip source code is under the LGPL-2.1-or-later license; the unRAR code, however, is under the LGPL-2.1-or-later license with an &quot;unRAR restriction&quot;, which states that developers are not permitted to use the code to reverse-engineer the RAR compression algorithm.

Since version 21.01 alpha, Linux support has been added to the 7zip project.

==Archive formats==

===7z===
By default, 7-Zip creates 7z-format archives with a codice_4 file extension. Each archive can contain multiple directories and files. As a &quot;container&quot; format, security or size reduction are achieved by looking for similarities throughout the data using a stacked combination of filters. These can consist of pre-processors, compression algorithms, and encryption filters.

The core 7z compression uses a variety of algorithms, the most common of which are bzip2, PPMd, LZMA2, and LZMA. Developed by Pavlov, LZMA is a relatively new system, making its debut as part of the 7z format. LZMA uses an LZ-based sliding dictionary of up to 3840 MB in size, backed by a range coder.

The native 7z file format is open and modular. File names are stored as Unicode.

In 2011, TopTenReviews found that the 7z compression was at least 17% better than ZIP, and 7-Zip&#x27;s own site has since 2002 reported that while compression ratio results are very dependent upon the data used for the tests, &quot;Usually, 7-Zip compresses to 7z format 30–70% better than to zip format, and 7-Zip compresses to zip format 2–10% better than most other zip-compatible programs.&quot;

The 7z file format specification is distributed with the program&#x27;s source code, in the &quot;doc&quot; sub-directory.

===Others===
7-Zip supports a number of other compression and non-compression archive formats (both for packing and unpacking), including ZIP, gzip, bzip2, xz, tar, and WIM. The utility also supports unpacking APM, ar, ARJ, chm, cpio, deb, FLV, JAR, LHA/LZH, LZMA, MSLZ, Office Open XML, onepkg, RAR, RPM, smzip, SWF, XAR, and Z archives and cramfs, DMG, FAT, HFS, ISO, MBR, NTFS, SquashFS, UDF, and VHD disk images. 7-Zip supports the ZIPX format for unpacking only. It has had this support since at least version 9.20, which was released in late 2010. 7-Zip added support for RAR5 in 2015.

7-Zip can open some MSI files, allowing access to the meta-files within along with the main contents. Some Microsoft CAB (LZX compression) and NSIS (LZMA) installer formats can be opened. Similarly, some Microsoft executable programs (.EXEs) that are self-extracting archives or otherwise contain archived content (e.g., some setup files) may be opened as archives.

When compressing ZIP or gzip files, 7-Zip uses its own DEFLATE encoder, which may achieve higher compression, but at lower speed, than the more common zlib DEFLATE implementation. The 7-Zip deflate encoder implementation is available separately as part of the AdvanceCOMP suite of tools.

The decompression engine for RAR archives was developed using freely available source code of the unRAR program, which has a licensing restriction against creation of a RAR compressor. 7-Zip v15.06 and later support extraction of files in the RAR5 format. Some backup systems use formats supported by archiving programs such as 7-Zip; e.g., some Android backups are in codice_5 format, and can be extracted by archivers such as 7-Zip.

Some forks add more formats.

==File manager==
7-Zip comes with a file manager along with the standard archiver tools. The file manager has a toolbar with options to create an archive, extract an archive, test an archive to detect errors, copy, move, and delete files, and open a file properties menu exclusive to 7-Zip. The file manager, by default, displays hidden files because it does not follow Windows Explorer&#x27;s policies. The tabs show name, modification time, original and compressed sizes, attributes, and comments (4DOS codice_6 format).

When going up one directory on the root, all drives, removable or internal appear. Going up again shows a list with four options:
* Computer: loads the drives list
* Documents: loads user&#x27;s documents, usually at codice_7
* Network: loads a list of all network clients connected
* \\.: Same as &quot;Computer&quot; except loads the drives in low-level filesystem access. This results in critical drive files and deleted files still existing on the drive to appear. (NOTE: As of November 2020, access to the active partition in low-level mode is not allowed for currently unknown reasons.)

==Features==
7-Zip supports:
* 32 and 64-bit x86, ARM64 architecture
* File Manager
* Encryption via the 256-bit AES cipher, which can be enabled for both files and the 7z hierarchy. When the hierarchy is encrypted, users are required to supply a password to see the filenames contained within the archive. WinZip-developed Zip file AES encryption standard is also available in 7-Zip to encrypt ZIP archives with AES 256-bit, but it does not offer filename encryption as in 7z archives.
* Volumes of dynamically variable sizes, allowing use for backups on removable media such as writable CDs and DVDs
* Usability as a basic orthodox file manager when used in dual panel mode
* Multiple-core CPU threading
* Opening EXE files as archives, allowing the decompression of data from inside many &quot;Setup&quot; or &quot;Installer&quot; or &quot;Extract&quot; type programs without having to launch them
* Unpacking archives with corrupted filenames, renaming the files as required
* Create self-extracting single-volume archives
* Command-line interface
* Graphical user interface. The Windows version comes with its own GUI. For various Unix-like systems, several GUIs, e.g. PeaZip, can handle the 7z file format based on the Unix binaries.
* Calculating checksums in the formats CRC-32, CRC-64, SHA-1, or SHA-256 for files on disk, available either via command line or Explorer&#x27;s context menu
* Available in 89 languages
* Ability to optionally record creation dates (codice_8) and last access dates (codice_9) in archives (in addition to modification dates).

==Versions==
Two command-line versions are provided: 7z (7z.exe), using external libraries; and 7za (7za.exe), which is a standalone executable containing built-in modules, but with compression/decompression support limited to 7z, ZIP, gzip, bzip2, Z and tar formats. A 64-bit version is available, with support for large memory maps, leading to faster compression. All versions support multi-threading.

=== Forks ===
* &quot;p7zip&quot; has been a fork for Unix-like operating systems (including Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS), FreeDOS, OpenVMS, AmigaOS 4, and MorphOS. 
* 7-zip ZS is a fork with Zstandard and various other compression algorithms added to the file format.
** &quot;p7zip-zstd&quot; (p7zip with zstd) is p7zip with ZS additions.
* &quot;NanaZip&quot; is a fork integrating changes from many sources, modernized for the Microsoft Store.

=== Plugins ===
7-zip comes with a plug-in system for expansion. The official &quot;Links&quot; page points to many plugins written by TC4Shell, providing extra file support.

==Software development kit==
7-Zip has a LZMA SDK which was originally dual-licensed under both the GNU LGPL and Common Public License, with an additional special exception for linked binaries. On 2 December 2008, the SDK was placed by Igor Pavlov in the public domain.

==Security==
On older versions, self-extracting archives were vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through DLL hijacking: they load and run a DLL named UXTheme.dll, if it is in the same folder as the executable file. 7-Zip 16.03 Release notes say that the installer and SFX modules have added protection against DLL preloading attack.

Versions of 7-Zip prior to 18.05 contain an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the module for extracting files from RAR archives (), a vulnerability that was fixed on 30 April 2018.

Versions prior to 23.0 also contained an arbitrary code execution vulnerability, fixed on 7 May 2023. A year later, a severe remote code execution vulnerability was found on versions prior to 24.07 (), it was fixed on 20 November 2024.

==Reception and usage==
Snapfiles.com in 2012 rated 7-Zip 4.5 stars out of 5, noting, &quot;[its] interface and additional features are fairly basic, but the compression ratio is outstanding&quot;.

On TechRepublic in 2009, Justin James found the detailed settings for Windows File Manager integration were &quot;appreciated&quot; and called the compression-decompression benchmark utility &quot;neat&quot;. And though the archive dialog has settings that &quot;will confound most users&quot;, he concluded: &quot;7-Zip fits a nice niche in between the built-in Windows capabilities and the features of the paid products, and it is able to handle a large variety of file formats in the process.&quot;

Between 2002 and 2024, 7-Zip was downloaded 428 million times from SourceForge alone.

The software has received awards, In 2007, SourceForge granted it community choice awards for &quot;Technical Design&quot; and for &quot;Best Project&quot;. In 2013, Tom&#x27;s Hardware conducted a compression speed test comparing 7-ZIP, MagicRAR, WinRAR, WinZip; they concluded that 7-ZIP beat out all the others with regards to compression speed, ratio, and size and awarded the software the 2013 Tom&#x27;s Hardware Elite award.

<text>New Westminster (colloquially known as New West) is a city in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada, and a member municipality of the Metro Vancouver Regional District. It was founded by Major-General Richard Moody as the capital of the Colony of British Columbia in 1858 and continued in that role until the Mainland and Island colonies were merged in 1866. It was the British Columbia Mainland&#x27;s largest city from that year until it was passed in population by Vancouver during the first decade of the 20th century.

It is located on the banks of the Fraser River as it turns southwest towards its estuary, on the southwest side of the Burrard Peninsula and roughly at the centre of the Greater Vancouver region.

==History==
The area now known as New Westminster was originally inhabited by Kwantlen First Nation. The discovery of gold in BC and the arrival of gold seekers from the south prompted fear amongst the settlers that Americans may invade to take over this land.

Richard Clement Moody arrived in British Columbia in December 1858, at the head of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, having been hand picked to &quot;found a second England on the shores of the Pacific&quot;. Moody &quot;wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness&quot; and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, &quot;styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the Crown and of the robe&quot;. Subsequent to the enactment of the Pre-emption Act of 1860, Moody settled the Lower Mainland and selected the site and founded the new capital, New Westminster. Moody and the Royal Engineers were trained in settlement and selected the site because of its defensibility: it was farther from the American border than the site of the colony&#x27;s proclamation, Fort Langley, possessed &quot;great facilities for communication by water, as well as by future great trunk railways into the interior&quot;, and possessed an excellent port. Moody was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site, writing in his letter to Blackwood:

The entrance to the Fraser is very striking—Extending miles to the right &amp; left are low marsh lands (apparently of very rich qualities) &amp; yet the Background of Superb Mountains—Swiss in outline, dark in woods, grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you. Everything is large and magnificent, worthy of the entrance to the Queen of England&#x27;s dominions on the Pacific mainland. [...] My imagination converted the silent marshes into Cuyp-like pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset. [...] The water of the deep clear Frazer was of a glassy stillness, not a ripple before us, except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away.
It was suggested by Moody and the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment that the site be proclaimed &quot;Queensborough&quot;. Governor James Douglas proclaimed the new capital with this name on February 14, 1859. The name &quot;Queensborough&quot;, however, did not appeal to London and it was Queen Victoria who named the city after Westminster, that part of the British capital of London where the Parliament Buildings were, and are to this day, situated. From this naming by the Queen, the City gained its official nickname, &quot;the Royal City&quot;. A year later New Westminster became the first City in British Columbia to be incorporated and have an elected municipal government. It became a major outfitting point for prospectors coming to the Fraser Gold Rush, as all travel to the goldfield ports of Yale and Port Douglas was by steamboat or canoe up the Fraser River.
However, Colonial Office secretary Edward Bulwer-Lytton &quot;forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town&quot; and the efforts of Moody&#x27;s engineers were continuously hampered by insufficient funds, which, together with the continuous opposition of Douglas, &quot;made it impossible for [Moody&#x27;s] design to be fulfilled&quot;.

Governor Douglas spent little time in New Westminster and had little affection for the city; and the feelings were amply repaid by the citizens of New Westminster, who avidly supported Colonel Moody&#x27;s city-building efforts and castigated the governor, who preferred to remain for the most part isolated in distant Victoria. In contrast to Victoria, where settlers from England had established a strong British presence, New Westminster&#x27;s early citizens were largely Canadians and Maritimers, who brought a more business-oriented approach to commerce and dismissed the pretensions of the older community. Despite being granted a municipal council, the mainlanders in New Westminster also pressed for a legislative assembly to be created for British Columbia, and were infuriated when Governor Douglas granted free port status to Victoria, which stifled the economic growth of the Fraser River city. Moreover, to pay for the expense of building roads into the Interior of the colony, Douglas imposed duties on imports into New Westminster.

In 1866, the Colony of British Columbia and the Colony of Vancouver Island were united as &quot;British Columbia&quot;. However, the capital of the Colony of Vancouver Island, Victoria, was made the capital of the newly amalgamated Colony of British Columbia following a vote in the House of Assembly. On the day of the vote, one member of the assembly, William Cox (one of the colony&#x27;s Gold Commissioners and a Victoria supporter), shuffled the pages of the speech that William Franklyn from Nanaimo (a New Westminster supporter) intended to give, so that Franklyn lost his place and read the first paragraph three times. Cox then popped the lenses of Franklyn&#x27;s glasses from their frames so that the Nanaimo representative could see nothing at all of his speech. After a recess to settle the resulting uproar and allow the member from Nanaimo a chance to sort out his speaking notes and his spectacles, the Speaker John Sebastian Helmcken (from Victoria) refused to allow Franklyn a &quot;second&quot; chance to speak. The subsequent vote was 13 to 8 against New Westminster.

With the entry of British Columbia into the Dominion of Canada in 1871, as the sixth province, New Westminster&#x27;s economic prospects improved, but the Royal City would lose out again, this time to the new railway terminus town of Vancouver, when the Canadian Pacific Railway was extended to the shores of Burrard Inlet, even though a spur of the railway did reach New Westminster in 1886.

In 1898, a fire destroyed downtown New Westminster, and in 1916 the federal government shut down the &quot;common&quot; reserves set aside for Coastal First Nations people who visited New Westminster during the fishing season. In 1916 the remaining land on Poplar Island was turned over to the BC government.

From 1927 to 1969, the British Columbia Shore Station Oceanographic Program was collecting coastal water temperature and salinity measurements from New Westminster every day for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

In 1991, the New Westminster Armoury was recognized as a Federal Heritage building on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings. Along with the rest of the Greater Vancouver region, in 2020 New Westminster experienced the worst air quality in the world due to the combined effects of the 2020 Western American wildfires and a fire at the old Pier at the quay.

In 2022, efforts were made within the city to phase-out the &quot;Royal City&quot; moniker and undergo a rebrand of the city&#x27;s logo and mottos.

==Geography==
New Westminster is located on the Burrard Peninsula, mainly on the north bank of the Fraser River. It is southeast of the City of Vancouver proper, adjacent to Burnaby and Coquitlam and across the Fraser River from Surrey and Delta. A portion of New Westminster called Queensborough is located on the eastern tip of Lulu Island, adjacent to Richmond. The total land area is .

===Historical urban geography===
New Westminster has changed markedly over time and by the results of its incorporation into the wider urbanization of the Lower Mainland. (See also: Architecture of Greater Vancouver.)

====BC Penitentiary====
In 1878, the Government of Canada opened the British Columbia Penitentiary, the first federal penitentiary west of Manitoba. &quot;BC Pen&quot;, or simply &quot;the Pen&quot;, as it was known (and also in old days as the &quot;skookum house&quot; in the English-Chinook Jargon patois common in early BC), was located between the Sapperton neighbourhood and what is now Queen&#x27;s Park. It housed maximum-security prisoners for the next 102 years, closing in 1980. The original centre block of the Pen still stands and has been converted into offices. The Gatehouse, steps leading up to it and old Coal House still stand. The rest of the Pen&#x27;s grounds have been filled with newly built townhouses and condominiums and parkland. Below the main complex on the waterfront the prison&#x27;s old armoury still stands as part of a new waterfront park; this was also the location of the prison&#x27;s wharf which was much-used when steamboat was the main means of transportation within the Lower Mainland and for some years after.

====Woodlands====
The mental hospital for children, was located to the west of the BC Pen and was adjacent to the offramps of the Pattullo Bridge. After it was closed, the derelict main building was, except for the tower entrance, destroyed by fire on July 9, 2008. In October 2011, all remaining old structures were leveled and cleared, to the joy of some former residents who had bad memories of their childhood experiences.

====Chinatown====
New Westminster&#x27;s Chinatown was one of the earliest established in the mainland colony and initially the second-largest after Victoria&#x27;s. Prior to the rise of Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown it was the largest on the mainland following Barkerville&#x27;s wane as a centre of population.

It was located along Front Street. A second Chinatown opened in an area known as &quot;The Swamp&quot; at the southwestern edge of downtown, bounded roughly by Royal Avenue, Columbia Street, and 8th and 12th Streets. The &quot;Swamp&quot; name is because area was then boggy ground of low value for the stone and brick buildings of the main part of downtown up Columbia Street to the northeast; and also close to the river and the railway.

Chinatown was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1898 and only partly rebuilt afterwards, with a church and cultural and community events hall the first to be started.

====Columbia Street====
Until the 1964 completion of the Highway 1 freeway, which bypassed New Westminster to its north, Columbia Street, the downtown core of New Westminster close to the city&#x27;s waterfront, was the main commercial retail and service centre for the Fraser Valley and nearby areas of Burnaby and Coquitlam. Known as &quot;the golden mile&quot;, it hosted major department stores such as Eaton&#x27;s, Kresge&#x27;s and Woolworths as well as long-established New Westminster retailers. This was a time when road travel to Vancouver remained distant for Valley communities, and daily interurban rail service to and from Chilliwack was still in place (the service ended in 1950). The quality of shops was such that even Vancouverites would make the trip by interurban rail or, later on, via Kingsway (originally called the Westminster Highway or Westminster Road), to shop on Columbia Street. In addition to the retailers, Columbia Street was home to major movie houses, the Columbia and the Paramount, rivalling in size and quality to those on Vancouver&#x27;s Theatre Row. The freeway and the building of suburban malls with free parking is generally conceded to have &quot;killed&quot; Columbia Street, which fell into a slump despite the building of a large parkade above nearby Front Street in the 50s and 60s. Department stores (other than the Army and Navy) left downtown as the Uptown area continued to develop to become New Westminster&#x27;s main retail and services centre. In October 2006, Columbia Street underwent reconstruction to change to one lane in both directions, with a bike lane and reverse angle parking. This was done to encourage more foot and bicycle traffic. Major high-rise or renovation projects are completed or nearing completion. By May 2012, these include the Plaza 88 development which includes three condominium towers, the complete renovation of the Columbia which is now a cabaret style theatre for concerts, weddings and fundraisers, and the home of Lafflines Comedy Club. The new $25 million Westminster Pier Park officially opened on June 16, 2012, and a new civic centre and office tower named The Anvil Centre on Columbia Street at Begbie Street completed Sept. 2014. The Salient Group built a tower on top of the Trapp + Holbrook buildings (while restoring the facade) and another condominium called Northbank was built at the east entrance of Columbia Street. Close to the Trapp building, a major fire razed the E.L. Lewis Building and the Hamley Block on October 13, 2013, displacing 30 businesses and destroying a chunk of Columbia Street&#x27;s historical character. One of the most well-known of these businesses was Copp&#x27;s Shoes, which had not changed between its 1925 opening and its closure in early 2013.

==== Connaught Heights ====
The westernmost neighbourhood in the city, Connaught Heights, began life as District Lot 172 after the Royal Engineers surveyed the land in the 1860s. In 1892, when the official civic boundaries for New Westminster were set, they only included its original city and suburban lots, thus leaving District Lot 172 disincorporated. The City of Burnaby also chose not to incorporate District Lot 172 when its official civic boundaries were set, resulting in the area being outside any municipal jurisdiction.

In 1911, the original landowner subdivided the land into residential lots that followed the grid established by neighbouring New Westminster; the first residential home had only been built a year prior. In 1912, the BC Electric Railway took advantage of this by building the &quot;Connaught Hill&quot; station at Tenth Avenue for the new interurban electric tramway, which connected New Westminster with Vancouver. The station was named for Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. This station became the namesake for the neighbourhood, while the modern SkyTrain tracks follow the path of this historic tramway.

Initially, the provincial government neglected the district, but as the density of residents increased so did the quality of amenities and civic services. In 1939, when there were approximately 200 homes, funding was secured to improve the water and electric services under the &quot;Municipality Improvements Assistance Act 1938&quot;. Before the improvements, District Lot 172 was designated as Connaught Heights Waterworks District under the Water Act. Following these improvements, land was set aside for a school and parksite. By the 1950s, the notion of incorporating Connaught Heights Waterworks District into New Westminster became more commonplace. In 1960, the construction of the Queensborough Bridge resulted in the demolition of property in Connaught Heights Waterworks District, showing further interaction between the city and district. The first of two referendums to vote on incorporating Connaught Heights Waterworks District into the City of New Westminster was held in 1961, which failed to achieve enough positive votes to proceed with incorporation. Construction of Connaught Heights Elementary School was completed in 1963, and the school was opened and joined the New Westminster School District the following year. A second referendum was held in 1964, which garnered enough positive votes to make Connaught Heights Waterworks District part of New Westminster. By 1965, the amalgamation was officially complete, with Connaught Heights becoming the newest neighbourhood in New Westminster.

====Front Street====
Originally a dockside street and market, and also the location of the original Chinatown, Front Street was converted into a truck-route bypass and elevated parkade during the 1960s in an effort to provide increased parking for adjacent Columbia Street. In recent decades it has been the focus of the city&#x27;s thriving antiques and second-hand trade, which is also concentrated on 12 Street. It has also been used as a location in feature films such as &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; (substituting for the Bronx), &quot;I, Robot&quot; (as a futuristic Chicago), &quot;Shooter&quot; (doubling for Philadelphia, with the Fraser River being the Delaware River), and &quot;New Moon&quot;. In early 2016, a partial demolition of the parkade commenced as part of the City&#x27;s continued efforts to revitalize and improve their waterfront area.

====Government House====
The original colonial Government House was located approximately where Royal City Manor is now. It was originally occupied by Colonel Richard Moody, who commanded the Columbia Detachment of Royal Engineers who established the city. Rarely used by Governor Douglas, its first full-time vice-regal resident was Governor Frederick Seymour.

====New Westminster Canadian Pacific Railway Station====
A former Canadian Pacific Railway station is adjacent to the New Westminster Skytrain station. It is a two-storey asymmetrical red brick building with steeply pitched bellcast roofs. The building, which was built in 1899, is a classic example of CPR&#x27;s signature Château-styled railway stations. In 1911, two wings were added to the station, and in 1973, the ageing train station was converted into a branch of The Keg restaurant chain. In 2013, however, the restaurant closed its doors to the public due to structural issues surrounding the then-114-year-old structure. As of 2023, the train station is occupied by Kelly O&#x27;Bryan&#x27;s, a BC Irish restaurant and pub chain.

====Queensborough====

Queensborough was the name originally chosen for the colonial capital by Royal Engineer commander Colonel Richard Clement Moody. When Queen Victoria designated New Westminster instead as her new capital&#x27;s name, the name Queensborough became applied to New Westminster&#x27;s portion of Lulu Island, across the north arm of the Fraser from the southern end of the city. Queensborough is today a growing housing area with its own distinct identity. Some new condominium complexes have been built adjacent to the Westminster Quay development. In the Chinook Jargon, &quot;Koonspa&quot;, an adaptation of the name Queensborough, is the usual name for New Westminster as a whole.
====Sapperton====

Sapperton was originally a &quot;suburb&quot; of New Westminster, named for the Columbia Detachment of Royal Engineers (&quot;Sappers&quot;), whose camp was on the hill now occupied by the Fraserview neighbourhood. It is the location of the historic Fraser Cemetery, which rivals Victoria&#x27;s Ross Bay Cemetery for the number of historically significant graves and monuments. Sapperton is the home of the first commercial brewery to operate in British Columbia known as the &quot;City Brewery&quot;. Over the years the brewery changed hands and was operated by Labatts until it closed in 2005. In its place is a recent condo development known as the &quot;Brewery District&quot;, although there is no brewery on the premises. New Westminster does have two breweries currently. One is named Steel &amp; Oak which opened its doors in 2014 and is situated on the other end of the Westminster Quay. The other brewery in New Westminster is named Another Beer Co and it is located in Sapperton, close to where the Labatts Brewery was in the Brewery District, since 2019. Also located in Sapperton are the Royal Columbian Hospital, Sapperton Station, Braid Station, and the TransLink (British Columbia) headquarters.

====Uptown &quot;6th and 6th&quot;====
Development of an uptown commercial area around 6th Street and 6th Avenue started in 1954, with the opening of Woodward&#x27;s department store. Added momentum came with the relocation of the public library from downtown to uptown in 1958. In 1992 Woodward&#x27;s was expanded and modernized into a shopping centre and took the name Woodwards Place. With the bankruptcy of Woodward&#x27;s in 1993, the name of the centre was changed to Royal City Centre Mall. Moody Park is an important recreational area in the uptown area.

====West End====
Opposite Sapperton&#x27;s north end, New Westminster&#x27;s West End was once fairly separate from the city proper, and has a neighbourhood commercial node along 12th Street and 20th Street approximately between London Street and Eighth Ave. The 12th Street area features antique and one-of-a-kind stores.

====Westminster Quay====

Westminster Quay was a mid-1980s development to revitalize New Westminster and accompanied the development of the SkyTrain line to Vancouver. In addition to a large public market and a 2.5-diamond-rated hotel, The Inn at the Quay, a large condominium tower and townhouse complex was built, accessed from the older Columbia Street area of downtown by an overpass. The impetus provided by this project has spilled over onto the inland side of the rail tracks, with new tower developments focusing on the area southwest of 8th Street (the area known formerly as &quot;the Swamp&quot; and Chinatown). As of July 2007, the Quay&#x27;s commercial component had noticeably decreased, with many vacancies, compared to the much more active Lonsdale Quay Market in North Vancouver. Responding to the decrease of business, the ownership group closed the Westminster Quay Market for renovations. The market re-opened as The River Market in September 2010 with Donald&#x27;s Market as the main anchor. The Westminster Quay is also known to house a tin soldier which was given the title of the world&#x27;s largest by the Guinness Book of World Records back in 2002.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, New Westminster had a population of 78,916 living in 36,099 of its 37,737 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 70,996. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. New Westminster had the second highest population density of any Canadian city, trailing only Vancouver.

=== Ethnicity ===
A legacy of early 20th century settlement, the Queensborough neighbourhood has a large South Asian population, primarily of Punjabi Sikh descent.
=== Languages ===
The 2016 census found that English was spoken as mother tongue by 50.47% of the population. The next most common mother tongue language was Tagalog, spoken by 4.5% of the population, followed by Mandarin at 4.4%, and Punjabi at 3.5%.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in New Westminster included:
*Irreligion (36,595 persons or 46.9%)
*Christianity (30,345 persons or 38.9%)
*Sikhism (3,750 persons or 4.8%)
*Islam (2,655 persons or 3.4%)
*Hinduism (2,000 persons or 2.6%)
*Buddhism (1,455 persons or 1.9%)
*Judaism (255 persons or 0.3%)
*Indigenous spirituality (20 persons or &lt;0.1%)

==Media==
&quot;The Columbian&quot;, originally the &quot;British Columbian&quot;, British Columbia&#x27;s second newspaper, was founded in New Westminster by John Robson (later premier of British Columbia). By the mid-20th century, it had long since been eclipsed by the Vancouver newspapers, and published its last issue on November 15, 1983, after a run of 123 years.

CKNW, one of Canada&#x27;s first private news radio, hot-line and talk stations, began broadcasting from studios in New Westminster on April 1, 1944, originally in the Royal Windsor Hotel, then at a few other locations in the city, before moving to downtown Vancouver from its final New Westminster location at 8th and McBride, which it occupied from 1967 onwards. Although it has broadcast from Vancouver for the better part of half a century, it is still licensed to New Westminster and its callsign still includes the letters &quot;NW&quot; for New Westminster. It is a mainstay of the BC broadcasting industry where many notable reporters and broadcasters had their start.

New Westminster is served by two publications: &quot;New Westminster Record&quot;, part of the Glacier Media chain, which publishes online. In May 2022, &quot;New West Anchor&quot;, a biweekly newsletter delivering news and event listings via email, was launched by former CKNW and CityNews Vancouver journalist Ria Renouf. Colloquially known as &quot;The Anchor&quot;, it is a sister publication to &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;: both are owned by Overstory Media Group. 

New Westminster also had a community humour magazine called Piffle. Piffle is the creation of Columbian Newspaper sports writer Ron Loftus. When Ron retired, he sold Piffle to another Columbian reporter Chris Sargent, who published the magazine for the last 14 years.

==Arts and culture==
The city has several live performance venues, ranging from the Massey Theatre adjacent to New Westminster High School, to the Burr Theatre, a converted cinema on Columbia Street, and two theatrical venues in Queens Park (One being the Bernie Legge Theatre, home of the Vagabond Players, which were formed in 1937.) The Royal City Musical Theatre, a long-established New Westminster tradition, uses the Massey, while comedy and mystery theatricals use the stages in Queens Park. Also in Queens Park is the Queens Park Arena, longtime home to the legendary New Westminster Salmonbellies professional lacrosse team, as well as an open-air stadium used for baseball and field sports. The Burr Theatre (originally the Columbia Theatre), named for New Westminster native Raymond Burr, was operated by the Raymond Burr Performing Arts Society who produced professional -quality mysteries and comedies between October 2000 and January 2005. February 2005 saw the theatre reopen as a vaudeville theatre with three major productions by The Heartaches Razz Band and in February 2006 collaboration with The Screaming Chicken Theatrical Society produced the first Annual Vancouver International Burlesque Festival. The theatre was sold by the City of New Westminster through a public request for proposal process to the owner of Lafflines Comedy Club. After extensive renovations to convert it into a cabaret style theatre, it is now called The Columbia, home of Lafflines Comedy Club. Douglas College also offers post-secondary training in theatre, stagecraft and music, as well as non-credit courses in music for all ages and ability levels, through the Douglas College Community Music School. Theatre productions and music concerts at Douglas College take place in the Laura C. Muir Performing Arts Theatre and the smaller, more intimate Studio Theatre from September to April. Every year, New Westminster hosts the New West Cultural Crawl to showcase the city&#x27;s unique and talented artists. The unique Mushtari Begum Festival of Indian Classical Music and Dance, debuted in 2012, is produced by internationally acclaimed artists Cassius Khan and Amika Kushwaha to preserve the rare Indian arts, and is partnered with the Massey Theatre.

==Heritage==
The main feature of the New Westminster Museum and Archives (NWMA) is the 1865 Irving House, which is said to be the oldest intact house in the BC Lower Mainland. In the museum are treasures such as the 1876 coach used by Lord Dufferin, then Governor General of Canada, to tour the new province of British Columbia including Barkerville via the Cariboo Road. The city&#x27;s archives hold corporate and personal treasures such as 1859 maps of the city drawn by the Royal Engineers and official city records. Other heritage artifacts in the city include the 1937 &quot;Samson V&quot; paddlewheeler, the 1890s armouries, 1850s historic cannons, two of the old BC Pen buildings, numerous cemeteries, and dozens of heritage homes, many of which are from the 19th century. The Museum is affiliated with Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

===Hyack Festival and the Hyack Anvil Battery===
New Westminster&#x27;s May Day celebration began in 1870 and continues today as an important civic tradition, lending the city the distinction of having the longest-running May Day celebration of its type in the British Commonwealth. Within BC, at least four other communities still celebrate May Day: Port Coquitlam, Ladner in Delta (whose May Day Festival began in 1896), Bradner in Abbotsford, and The Sunshine Coast&#x27;s Pender Harbour.


The May Day festival, held on the Victoria Day weekend and more formally known as the Hyack Festival, is distinguished by the Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery Salute, a tradition created by The New Westminster Fire Department during colonial times as a surrogate for a 21-gun salute. With no cannons available in the early colony, the Fire Department—known as the Hyacks, from the Chinook Jargon for &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;quick&quot;, here derived from its use as a command for &quot;hurry up!&quot;— improvised by placing gunpowder between two anvils, the top one upturned, and igniting the charge from a safe distance, hurling the upper anvil into the air.

Each year, in preparation for May Day, local schoolchildren are taught to dance around a maypole with colourful ribbons. Elections are held at elementary schools in the city, and, from them one girl is selected to become the year&#x27;s May Queen, and two students from each school to become members of her &quot;May Queen Suite&quot; and &quot;Royal Knights.&quot; On a Wednesday of the festival, elementary school students gather at Queen&#x27;s Park Stadium to dance, and the May Queen is crowned.

==Education==
Douglas College, a major post-secondary institution in Greater Vancouver, has a campus in New Westminster. The college has an enrollment of 14,000 students and offers degrees, associate degrees, and two-year career and University Transfer programs to local, national and international students.

The Justice Institute of British Columbia offers training to municipal police forces, fire departments, provincial corrections, court services, and paramedics with the British Columbia Ambulance Service.

==Transportation==

===Road network===
Much of New Westminster&#x27;s street network still conforms to the original grid laid out by the Royal Engineers at the time of settlement. The grid is oriented to the riverfront and therefore deviates from the compass directions: streets run northwest to southeast, and avenues run southwest to northeast.

The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) is accessible from nearby Coquitlam, via the Brunette Avenue interchange, and Burnaby, via the Cariboo Road and Canada Way interchanges, and provides expressway access to Vancouver, the North Shore, and the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal (to the west), and to the British Columbia interior and the communities of the Fraser Valley (to the east, via the Port Mann Bridge). On its northern and western edges, New Westminster is connected to Vancouver by the street system of the city of Burnaby. The three major arterial streets in Burnaby connecting New Westminster and Vancouver are Canada Way (until 1967 named the Grandview Highway, and called 8th St. once it enters New Westminster), Kingsway (12th St.), and Marine Way (Stewardson Way). Kingsway connects New Westminster with the major shopping and entertainment district of Metrotown, in central Burnaby, and then proceeds to downtown Vancouver.

The Queensborough Bridge (part of Highway 91A) connects mainland New Westminster to Queensborough, Richmond, and, via the Alex Fraser Bridge, Delta. The Pattullo Bridge links New Westminster with Surrey. The lesser-used Derwent Way Bridge connects Queensborough with Annacis Island of Delta.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the city reallocated road space in New Westminster for cyclists and pedestrians as part of Streets for People in 2020 initiative.

===Public transit===

Public transportation is provided by TransLink. Along with a number of bus routes, the city is served by the following stations on the SkyTrain system:

*22nd Street station (Expo Line)
*Braid station (Expo Line)
*Columbia station (Expo Line)
*New Westminster station (Expo Line)
*Sapperton station (Expo Line)

The city is located within Zone 2 of TransLink&#x27;s fare structure.
A passenger ferry runs from the Quay to the neighbourhood of Queensborough on Lulu Island.

===Railways===
The city is served by four railways: Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), Burlington Northern and Santa Fe, and the Southern Railway of British Columbia shortline. None offer passenger service.

===Streetcars and the interurban===
Until the 1950s, New Westminster was linked to Vancouver and other municipalities by the BC interurban tram network (a type of interurban electric railway) under British Columbia Electric Railway. The Central Park Line was operated from 1891 to 1958.

==Sports and recreation==
The New Westminster Salmonbellies are one of the oldest professional lacrosse teams in Canada, and also have junior and midget teams. The &#x27;Bellies, as they are also known, have won the Mann Cup twenty-four times. New Westminster is also the location of the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame.

The New Westminster Royals were a professional minor-league team from 1911 through 1914, in the heyday of the Pacific Coast Hockey League. Their home rink was the Denman Arena in Vancouver, which they shared with rivals the Vancouver Millionaires.

Playing at Queen&#x27;s Park Arena were two incarnations of a Western Hockey League junior team, the New Westminster Bruins (1971–1981 and 1983–1988).

The Royal City Hyacks Football Club offers football and cheerleading for youth aged 5–13, while the local high school, New Westminster Secondary School has high school football.

Pocomo Rugby Football Club and Douglas Rugby Club (both teams play in New Westminster) merged in 2005 to form the United Rugby Club. Pocomo moved to New Westminster in the late 1960s, eventually calling Hume Park its home field. Douglas was formed by Pocomo players attending Douglas College in 1972. United Rugby currently uses Hume Park and Queens Park for home venues.

Youth soccer in New Westminster is represented by the New West Youth Soccer Club (formerly known as Royal City Youth Soccer Club), established in 1965, with teams for boys and girls aged 4 to 17 that participate in league play from September to March. Additionally, the club offers spring programs for children aged 4 to 9 and futsal for children aged 10 to 17.

The Sapperton Rovers men&#x27;s soccer team has a long history in New Westminster. Soccer in the Sapperton Community goes back to mid 19th century; the first soccer game in BC was played in New Westminster on Victoria Day, May 24, 1862, in the Woodlands/Victoria Hill area. The Columbian newspaper reported that the Victoria Day celebration included several sporting and cultural events, including a &quot;football&quot; (soccer) match between the Royal Engineers, known as the &quot;Sappers&quot; and the townsfolk. Sapperton Park was donated to the city in 1907 for the sole purpose of being used as a soccer venue. Many teams have since carried the Sapperton name.

New Westminster co-hosted the 1973 Canada Games with Burnaby.

The Hyack Swim Club, in operation since 1973, trains swimmers at Canada Games Pool, from a grassroots level up to international competition. Swimmers from across the Lower Mainland come to Canada Games Pool to train with this swim club. The swim club has trained many Olympians, Paralympians, and members of Canada&#x27;s national team. Hyack Swim Club hosts four meets each year, two of which are held at Canada Games Pool. The premier meet each year is held during the Hyack Festival, and attracts swimmers from across the province, Alberta, Washington, and Oregon. Mark Bottrill has been Hyack&#x27;s Director of Swimming since 1999. Hyack Swim Club&#x27;s Drew Christensen represented Canada at the 2008 Paralympic Games.

In July 2014, Major League Soccer&#x27;s Vancouver Whitecaps FC announced plans to launch a USL-Pro team in New Westminster. If it had been approved, the club would have been the first division three club in Canada and the sixth professional team in the country.

<text>Rex Applegate (June 21, 1914 – July 14, 1998) was an American military officer who worked for the Office of Strategic Services, where he trained Allied special forces personnel in close-quarters combat during World War II. He held the rank of colonel.

==Early life==
Applegate was born on June 21, 1914, in Oregon. He was a descendant of Charles Applegate, who blazed the Oregon Trail in 1843 with his brothers Jesse and Lindsay and established the Applegate Trail. Applegate began hunting and shooting at a young age and learned marksmanship from his uncle Gus Peret who was a famed exhibition shooter and professional hunter at the time. Applegate graduated from the University of Oregon with a Business Degree in 1940 and went on to take a commission in the US Army as a second lieutenant. His first billet was with the 209th Military Police Company as a lung ailment kept him from holding a combat position.

==World War II==
In 1941, Applegate was developing armed and unarmed close quarter combat courses for the US Army at Camp Ritchie when he was recruited by Wild Bill Donovan for the OSS, specifically to build and run what was called &quot;The School for Spies and Assassins&quot;, the location of which is now Camp David. Donovan had Applegate learn all that he could about armed and unarmed fighting from William E. Fairbairn to form a brutal and effective system. He was the close-combat coordinator for all clandestine missions and this role brought him into contact with other fighters and martial artists of the time period such as a Finnish soldier who killed 21 Russians with a knife, and the founder of the British SAS: David Stirling.

At one point during the war, he served as the personal bodyguard to President Franklin D Roosevelt.

==Postwar life==
After the close of World War II, Applegate spent the next 15 years as an advisor to the government of Mexico who made him an &quot;Honorary General&quot;.

Applegate was friends with actor John Wayne and in addition to teaching Wayne how to shoot, Applegate served as a technical advisor on the set of &quot;The Alamo&quot;. Applegate was said to be the source and inspiration for several of Ian Fleming&#x27;s characters in the James Bond novels.

When not traveling to promote his pistol-shooting methods, Applegate spent his last years at the Applegate House in Yoncalla, Oregon and at his home in Scottsburg, Oregon. Rex Applegate&#x27;s daughter, historian Shannon Applegate, who writes and lectures on Oregon and the Applegate family history, lives in the adjacent homestead. Granddaughter, Jessica Applegate Brown, owns and manages Applegate House Vineyards, an organic vineyard on the historic Applegate House property.

==Battle methods==

===Unarmed combat===
In 1943 he wrote &quot;Kill or Get Killed&quot;, which is still considered a classic manual of Western-style hand-to-hand combat. The updated 1976 edition of &quot;Kill or Get Killed&quot; was published by the US Marine Corps as Fleet Marine Force Reference Publication 12-80. From the foreword:

Fleet Marine Force Reference Publication (FMFRP) 12-80, &quot;Kill or Get Killed&quot;, is published to ensure the retention and dissemination of useful information which is not intended to become doctrine or to be published in Fleet Marine Force manuals.

and

This reference publication was written in 1976 by Lieutenant Colonel Rex Applegate, USA (Ret), with the help of the Combat Section, Military Intelligence Training Center, Camp Ritchie, Maryland. At last there is one volume which speaks to the subjects of unarmed combat (offensive and defensive), combat use of weapons, disarming the enemy, handling of prisoners, the handle of mob/crowd disobedience, the use of chemicals in such situations, and how to establish a professional riot control unit.

Applegate developed the techniques outlined in the book during his work with William E. Fairbairn, who had previously developed his own techniques while working for the Shanghai Municipal Police from 1907 to 1940. Fairbairn drew heavily on Chinese martial arts, which he simplified and tailored to the needs of police training in one of the world&#x27;s most crime-ridden cities, due to its history of crime related to the opium trade, the rebellion, and the activities of Triad gangsters. His result was the development of Defendu, widely considered the first of what became known as modern combatives. Applegate&#x27;s techniques are heavily based on Fairbairn&#x27;s Defendu, enhanced with feedback from the OSS operatives who put his techniques into action during World War II.

===Combat handgun techniques===
Applegate was a proponent of the combat pistol shooting system outlined in &quot;Kill or Get Killed&quot;, which is based on point shooting with a strong emphasis on training for close-range, fast-response shooting. This system is somewhat at odds with another prominent system (developed and promoted by Jeff Cooper) called the modern technique. Both systems have many supporters, with variants of Cooper&#x27;s system being more commonly used. Supporters of Cooper&#x27;s methods point to the near-universal use of his system in the International Practical Shooting Confederation and other forms of action shooting, while Applegate&#x27;s supporters point to police incidents where officers trained in Cooper&#x27;s methods discharge many rounds at close range (most measured in tens of feet (3 m) or less) with few (if any) disabling hits. The last years of Applegate&#x27;s life were spent promoting his combat-pistol-shooting methods to police agencies. Applegate co-wrote &quot;The Close-Combat Files of Colonel Rex Applegate&quot; (with Chuck Melson), and was a founding member of the International Close Combat Instructors Association.

===Combat knife innovations===

In the early 1980s, Applegate released a design called the Applegate-Fairbairn fighting knife (a modified version of the World War II Fairbairn-Sykes knife). The new knife&#x27;s design was a collaborative effort by Applegate and Fairbairn during World War II, eliminating the major weaknesses of the F-S knife (among them a weak blade point and the impossibility of determining the blade&#x27;s orientation by grip alone). Boker Knives offers several versions of the A-F knife. Gerber Legendary Blades produced a line of folding knives by Applegate and Bill Harsey, Jr. based on the Applegate-Fairbairn fighting knife.

In the late 1980s Applegate released a modified version of Fairbairn&#x27;s Smatchet, which had been used by the SAS and OSS during World War II. The development of this weapon began as a collaborative effort between Applegate and Fairbairn during the war. Applegate named his double-edged knife the &quot;Applegate-Fairbairn Combat Smatchet&quot;; it was initially offered as a handmade knife by Bill Harsey, Jr., and later by Wells Creek Gun and Knife Works, and after that by Al Mar Knives. Following Mar&#x27;s death, Böker Knives was licensed to produce it. Applegate later had Harsey design a &quot;Mini-Smatchet&quot; (with a blade) which was produced by Boker.

Applegate was inducted into the Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1994 Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition of the impact his designs have made upon the cutlery industry and for his writings on knife fighting.

<text>Johann Schobert (c. 1720, 1735 or 1740 – 28 August 1767) was a composer and harpsichordist. His date of birth is given variously as about 1720, about 1735, or about 1740, his place of birth as Silesia, Alsace, or Nuremberg. He died after eating poisonous mushrooms that he insisted were edible.

==Career==

In 1760 or 1761, Schobert moved to Paris where he served in the household of Louis François I de Bourbon, prince de Conti. He composed many books of sonatas for his instrument, most of them with an accompanying part for one or more other instruments. Schobert also wrote harpsichord concertos, symphonies and the opéra comique &quot;Le Garde-Chasse et le Braconnier&quot;.

In Paris, Schobert came into contact with Leopold Mozart during the family&#x27;s grand tour. Reportedly, Schobert was offended by Mozart&#x27;s comments that his children played Schobert&#x27;s works with ease. Nevertheless, Schobert was a significant influence on the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who arranged a number of movements from Schobert&#x27;s sonatas for use in his own piano concertos.

Mozart biographer Dyneley Hussey writes that it was Schobert&#x27;s music that opened up Mozart to the possibility of adopting a poetic stance in his music. Citing Téodor de Wyzewa and Georges de Saint-Foix&#x27;s work on Mozart, Hussey points out that the four piano concertos, &quot;which are deliberate studies from Schobert&quot;, have a &quot;typically Mozartian&quot; stylized nature which is actually present in the Schobert works that he was emulating. Hussey concludes, &quot;So we may regard Schobert, to whom Wolfgang owes so much of the &#x27;romantic&#x27; element which appears in his work alongside of its &#x27;classic&#x27; grace and vigor, as being the first of his real masters.&quot;

In 1767, Schobert went mushroom picking with his family in Le Pré-Saint-Gervais near Paris. He tried to have a local chef prepare them, but was told they were poisonous. After unsuccessfully trying again at a restaurant at Bois de Boulogne, and being incorrectly told by a doctor acquaintance of his that the mushrooms were edible, he decided to use them to make a soup at home. Schobert, his wife, all but one of their children, and his doctor friend died.

<text>Atom Egoyan (; ; born July 19, 1960) is an Egyptian-Canadian filmmaker. Emerging in the 1980s as part of the Toronto New Wave, he made his career breakthrough with &quot;Exotica&quot; (1994), a film set in a strip club. Egoyan&#x27;s most critically acclaimed film is the drama &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; (1997), for which he received two Academy Award nominations. His biggest commercial success is the erotic thriller &quot;Chloe&quot; (2009).

Egoyan&#x27;s works often explore themes of alienation and isolation, featuring characters whose interactions are mediated through technology, bureaucracy, or other power structures. His films often follow non-linear plot structures, in which events are placed out of sequence in order to elicit specific emotional reactions from the audience by withholding key information.

He received the 2008 Dan David Prize for &quot;Creative Rendering of the Past&quot; and the 2015 Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award. Egoyan is married to actress Arsinée Khanjian, whom he has often cast in his films.

==Early life and education==
Egoyan was born Atom Yeghoyan on July 19, 1960, in Cairo, in what was then the United Arab Republic, to Armenian-Egyptian painters Shushan () and Joseph Yeghoyan. He was named Atom to mark the completion of Egypt&#x27;s first nuclear reactor. Egoyan has a younger sister, Eve. 

In 1963, because of a rise in Arab nationalism, the family left Cairo and moved to Victoria, British Columbia, in Canada. They changed their last name to Egoyan.

As a teenager, Egoyan became interested in reading and writing plays. Influences included Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. He also attributes his future in the film industry to Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Persona&quot; (1966), which he viewed at age 14, according to an interview he had with journalist Robert K. Elder for &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot;:

Egoyan graduated from Trinity College at the University of Toronto. It was at Trinity College that he came into contact with Harold Nahabedian, the Armenian-Canadian Anglican Chaplain of Trinity College. In interviews, Egoyan credited Nahabedian for introducing him to the language and history of his ethnic heritage. Egoyan wrote for the University of Toronto&#x27;s independent weekly, &quot;The Newspaper&quot;, during his time at the school.

== Career ==
Egoyan began making films in the early 1980s; his debut film &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1984) had a world premier at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg and won a major prize. The next year he directed the 1985 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Wall&quot;.

His commercial breakthrough came with his film &quot;Exotica&quot; (1994). He received the Grand Prix (Belgian Film Critics Association) in Brussels, the FIPRESCI Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and Best Motion Picture at the Canadian Screen Awards (then called the Genie Awards). 

Egoyan&#x27;s first attempt at adapted material resulted in his best-known work, the highly praised &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; (1997). It earned him three prizes at the 50th Cannes Film Festival: the Grand Prix, the FIPRESCI Jury Prize, and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. The film also earned Egoyan Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.

Beginning in 1996, Egoyan has directed several operas, including &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, and &quot;The Ring Cycle&quot;, at the Canadian Opera, Vancouver Opera, Pacific Opera Victoria, and elsewhere.
The film &quot;Ararat&quot; (2002) generated much publicity for Egoyan. After Henri Verneuil&#x27;s French-language film &quot;Mayrig&quot; (1991), it was the first major motion picture to deal directly with the Armenian genocide. &quot;Ararat&quot; later won the award for Best Motion Picture at the Canadian Screen Awards, marking Egoyan&#x27;s third win. The film was released in over 30 countries around the world. 

In 2004, Egoyan opened Camera Bar, a 50-seat cinema-lounge on Queen Street West in Toronto. The bar closed in 2006.

Beginning in September 2006, Egoyan taught at the University of Toronto for three years. He joined the Faculty of Arts and Science as the Dean&#x27;s Distinguished Visitor in theatre, film, music, and visual studies. He subsequently taught at Ryerson University. In 2006, he received the Master of Cinema Award of the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg.

His film &quot;Adoration (2008 film)&quot; has been adapted into an opera by Mary Kouyoumdjian and librettist Royce Vavrek. It premiered in New York in 2024 and is set to be presented again by LA Opera in 2025. 

In 2009, he directed the erotic thriller &quot;Chloe&quot;, which was theatrically released by Sony Pictures Classics on March 26, 2010. This film grossed $3 million in limited theatrical release in the United States, which was generally considered respectable for an arthouse film release in the early 2010&#x27;s. Several months after the DVD/Blu-ray release of &quot;Chloe&quot;, Egoyan said that &quot;Chloe&quot; had made more money than any of his previous films. The success of &quot;Chloe&quot; led Egoyan to receive many scripts of erotic thrillers.

In 2012, he directed a production of Martin Crimp&#x27;s &quot;Cruel and Tender&quot;. 

After the release of the West Memphis Three from 18 years in prison, Egoyan directed a movie about the case called &quot;Devil&#x27;s Knot&quot; (2013) starring Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth, based on a book, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three&quot; by Mara Leveritt. His next feature, &quot;The Captive&quot; (2014), starred Ryan Reynolds and screened in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where it received largely negative reviews from critics. Justin Chang from &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;a ludicrous abduction thriller that finds a once-great filmmaker slipping into previously un-entered realms of self-parody.&quot;

In 2015, Egoyan directed the thriller &quot;Remember&quot;, which starred Christopher Plummer and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, before being given a limited release in theatres. His 2019 drama &quot;Guest of Honour&quot;, was nominated for a Golden Lion in competition in Venice in 2019, had a Special Presentation at the Toronto International Film Festival, and opening night galas in Vancouver and Montreal. 
His latest film is &quot;Seven Veils (2023)&quot;; the film was a Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) Official Selection with a special advance premiere at the Canadian Opera Company’s theatre, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. 

He has also occasionally appeared in films as an actor, most notably in his own film &quot;Calendar&quot; and Jean Pierre Lefebvre&#x27;s &quot;The Box of Sun (La boîte à soleil)&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Egoyan is based in Toronto, where he lives with his wife, actress Arsinée Khanjian, who appears in many of his films, and their son, Arshile (named after the Armenian-American painter Arshile Gorky).

In 1999, Egoyan was made an Officer of the Order of Canada; he was promoted in 2015 to Companion of the Order of Canada, the highest grade of the honour. In 2009, he won the &#x27;Master of Cinema&#x27; award from the Mannheim Film Festival, 25 years after receiving his international festival premiere at the same event. In 2017, Egoyan was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the International Film Festival of India.

<text>The Ribblehead Viaduct or Batty Moss Viaduct carries the Settle–Carlisle railway across Batty Moss in the Ribble Valley at Ribblehead, in North Yorkshire, England. The viaduct, built by the Midland Railway, is north-west of Skipton and south-east of Kendal. It is a Grade II* listed structure. Ribblehead Viaduct is the longest and the third tallest structure on the Settle–Carlisle line.

The viaduct was designed by John Sydney Crossley, chief engineer of the Midland Railway, who was responsible for the design and construction of all major structures along the line. The viaduct was necessitated by the challenging terrain of the route. Construction began in late 1869. It necessitated a large workforce, up to 2,300 men, most of whom lived in shanty towns set up near its base. Over 100 men lost their lives during its construction. The Settle to Carlisle line was the last main railway in Britain to be constructed primarily with manual labour.

By the end of 1874, the last stone of the structure had been laid; on 1 May 1876, the Settle–Carlisle line was opened for passenger services. During the 1980s, British Rail proposed closing the line. In 1989, after lobbying by the public against closure, it was announced that the line would be retained. Since the 1980s, the viaduct has had multiple repairs and restorations and the lines relaid as a single track. The land underneath and around the viaduct is a scheduled ancient monument; the remains of the construction camp and navvy settlements (Batty Wife Hole, Sebastopol, and Belgravia) are located there.

==History==

===Background===

In the 1860s, the Midland Railway, keen to capitalise on the growth in rail traffic between England and Scotland, proposed building a line between Settle and Carlisle. The line was intended to join the Midland line between Skipton and Carnforth to the city of Carlisle. On 16 July 1866, the Midland Railway (Settle to Carlisle) Act was passed by Parliament, authorising the company &quot;to construct Railways from Settle to Hawes, Appleby, and Carlisle; and for other Purposes&quot;.

After the Act passed, the Midland Railway came to an agreement with the London &amp; North Western Railway, to run services on the LNWR line via Shap. The company applied for a bill of abandonment for its original plan but Parliament rejected the bill on 16 April 1869 and the Midland Railway was compelled to build the Settle to Carlisle line.

The line passed through difficult terrain that necessitated building several substantial structures. The company&#x27;s chief engineer, John Sydney Crossley and its general manager, James Joseph Allport, surveyed the line. Crossley was responsible for the design and construction of the major works, including Ribblehead Viaduct.
On 6 November 1869, a contract to construct the Settle Junction (SD813606) to Dent Head Viaduct section including Ribblehead Viaduct was awarded to contractor John Ashwell. The estimated cost was £343,318 and completion was expected by May 1873. Work commenced at the southern end of the line.

===Construction===
By July 1870, work had started on the foundations for Ribblehead Viaduct. On 12 October 1870, contractor&#x27;s agent William Henry Ashwell laid the first stone. Financial difficulties came to greatly trouble John Ashwell; on 26 October 1871, his contract was cancelled by mutual agreement. From this date, the viaduct was constructed by the Midland Railway who worked on a semi-contractual basis overseen by William Ashwell.

The viaduct was built by a workforce of up to 2,300 men. They lived, often with their families, in temporary camps, named &quot;Batty Wife Hole&quot;, &quot;Sebastopol&quot;, and &quot;Belgravia&quot; on adjacent land. More than a hundred workers lost their lives in construction-related accidents, fighting, or from outbreaks of smallpox. According to Church of England records, there are around 200 burials of men, women, and children in the graveyard at Chapel-le-Dale and the church has a memorial to the railway workers.

In December 1872, the design for Ribblehead Viaduct was changed from 18 arches to 24, each spanning . By August 1874, the arches had been keyed and the last stone was laid by the end of the year. A single track was laid over the viaduct and on 6 September 1874 the first train carrying passengers was hauled across by the locomotive &quot;Diamond&quot;. On 3 August 1875, the viaduct was opened for freight traffic and on 1 May 1876, the whole line opened for passenger services, following approval by Colonel F. H. Rich from the Board of Trade.

==Structure==
Ribblehead Viaduct is long, and above the valley floor at its highest point, it was designed to carry a pair of tracks aligned over the sleeper walls. The viaduct has 24 arches of span, the foundations of which are deep. The piers are tapered, roughly across at the base and thick near the arches and have loosely-packed rubble-filled cores. Every sixth pier is 50 per cent thicker, a mitigating measure against collapse should any of the piers fail. The north end is higher in elevation than the south, a gradient of 1:100.

The viaduct is faced with limestone masonry set in hydraulic lime mortar and the near-semicircular arches are red brick, constructed in five separate rings, with stone voussoirs. Sleeper walls rise from the arches to support the stone slabs of the viaduct&#x27;s deck and hollow spandrels support plain solid parapet walls. In total, 1.5 million bricks were used; some of the limestone blocks weigh eight tons.

Ribblehead Viaduct is above sea level on moorland exposed to the prevailing westerly wind. Its height, from foundation to rails is . It is long on a lateral curve with a radius of .

The viaduct is the longest structure on the Settle–Carlisle Railway which has two taller viaducts, Smardale Viaduct at near Crosby Garrett, and Arten Gill at . Ribblehead railway station is less than half a mile to the south and to the north is Blea Moor Tunnel, the longest on the line, near the foot of Whernside.

==Operations==
During 1964, several Humber cars were blown off their wagons while being carried over the viaduct on a freight train.

By 1980, the viaduct was in disrepair and many of its piers had been weakened by water ingress. Between 1981 and 1984, repairs were undertaken as a cost of roughly £100,000. Repairs included strengthening the piers by the addition of steel rails and concrete cladding. For safety reasons, the line was reduced to single track across the viaduct to avoid the simultaneous loading from two trains crossing and a 20mph speed limit was imposed. During 1988, minor repairs were carried out and trial bores were made into several piers. In 1989, a waterproof membrane was installed.

In the 1980s, British Rail proposed closing the line, citing the high cost of repairs to its major structures. Vigorous campaigning by the Friends of the Settle-Carlisle Line, formed during 1981, garnered and mobilised public support against the plan. In 1989, the line was saved from closure. According to Michael Portillo, who took the decision in his capacity as Minister of State for Transport, the economic arguments for closing it had been weakened by a spike in passenger numbers, and further studies by engineers had determined that restoration work would not be nearly as costly as estimated.

In November 1988, Ribblehead Viaduct was Grade II* listed. The surrounding land where the remains of its construction camps are located has been recognised as a scheduled monument.

Between 1990 and 1992, Ribblehead Viaduct underwent major restoration. Between September 1999 and March 2001, a programme of improvements was implemented involving renewal of track, replacement of ballast and the installation of new drainage. Restoration has allowed for increased levels of freight traffic assuring the line&#x27;s viability.

The Settle–Carlisle Line is one of three north–south main lines, along with the West Coast Main Line through Penrith and the East Coast Main Line via Newcastle. During 2016, the line carried seven passenger trains from Leeds to Carlisle per day in each direction, and long-distance excursions, many hauled by preserved steam locomotives.

Regular heavy freight trains use the route avoiding congestion on the West Coast Main Line. Timber trains, and stone from Ingleton quarry, pass over the viaduct when they depart from the yard opposite Ribblehead railway station. The stone from Ingleton is ferried to the terminal at Ribblehead by road. Limestone aggregate trains from Arcow quarry sidings (near ) run to various stone terminals in the Leeds and Manchester areas on different days – these trains reverse in the goods loop at Blea Moor signal box because the connection from the quarry sidings faces north.

Major restoration work started in November 2020 as a £2.1 million project to re-point mortar joints and replace broken stones got underway. Network Rail released a timelapse video of the works in June 2021.

==In popular culture==
Building the viaduct was the inspiration behind the ITV period drama series &quot;Jericho&quot;. The viaduct appears in the 1970 film &quot;No Blade of Grass&quot; and also in the 2012 film &quot;Sightseers&quot;. A number of other films and television programmes have also included the viaduct.

<text>The Constitution of Malaysia establishes a right to freedom of religion in Article 11. However, Islam is also established as the state religion of the country in article 3, and article 11 provides for legal restrictions on proselytizing to Muslims. According to Freedom House, the country was scored 1 out of 4 for freedom of religion, with 0 being the worst and 4 being the best, in 2023. Muslims themselves are subject to state enforcement of religious practices; they can be fined by the state for not fasting or praying, may be prohibited from converting, and only Muslims are considered to be ethnically Malay. Other religious communities are a large fraction of the population, while individuals with no religious affiliation (atheist, agnostic or other irreligious life stances) are much rarer and can be viewed with hostility.

== Religious demography ==
As of the 2020 Population and Housing Census, 63.5% of the population practices Islam; 18.7% Buddhism; 9.1% Christianity; 6.1% Hinduism; and 2.7% other or no religion. Other faiths include Animism, Folk religion, Sikhism and Baháʼí Faith.

However, these figures may be misleading as professing the religion of Islam is a requirement for being a Malay in the sense of the Malaysian Constitution. Moreover, Muslims who wish to leave Islam face strong disincentives.

==Scope of Islamic law in Malaysia==
The nation maintains two parallel justice systems in the country (see: Courts of Malaysia). One is the secular justice system based upon laws gazetted by Parliament. The other is sharia (syariah, Islamic law). Ostensibly Syariah Courts only have jurisdiction over persons who declare themselves to be Muslims. Consequently, this results in non-Muslims not having legal standing in Syariah Courts.

Non-Muslims can seek recourse from a Syriah court decision in the secular courts, which could overrule the Syariah courts. Syariah courts are limited in their jurisdiction by Article 121 of the Federal constitution. In 2006 a judge ruled that Article 121 limited the federal courts from ruling on matters ruled on by the Syariah court when it touches Islamic matters. This was seen as a misinterpretation of the article by some, and the case is under appeal in the court of appeals.

The rules of sharia are set by the various sultans of the states. Historically a sultan had absolute authority over the state. Prior to independence, Tunku Abdul Rahman managed to convince the sultans to cede some states&#x27; powers to the federal government. One of the terms of this agreement is that the sultans still are the ultimate authority of Islamic law in their respective states. The same arrangement was long held even during British colonial rule. In Selangor, the Selangor Non-Islamic Religions (Control of Propagation Among Muslims) Enactment 1988 was signed by the Sultan of Selangor into law forbidding non-Muslims from using the word &quot;Allah&quot; in a public context. Lawmakers have claimed that this enactment is contrary to the federal constitution.

Constitutionally (in Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia), one of the four tests for entitlement to the privileges accorded to a Malaysian Malay is that one must be a Muslim. The rationale for this is that Islam is considered intrinsic to Malay ethnic identity, which culturally and historically is ruled by a Sultan who is a Muslim. Another test is that one must follow the Malay culture. Controversially, court rulings have assumed that all ethnic Malays must automatically satisfy this constitutional definition of a Malaysian Malay, and have therefore concluded that they must satisfy all of its requirements, so they have to be Muslim.

On 29 September 2001, the then Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad declared that the country was an Islamic state (&quot;negara Islam&quot;). The opposition leader at the time, Lim Kit Siang, is now actively seeking support to declare Mahathir&#x27;s move as unconstitutional by repeatedly clarifying that Malaysia is a secular state with Islam as its official religion as enshrined in the Constitution. However, the coalition government headed by Mahathir at the time held more than two-thirds of the seats in parliament. A two-thirds majority vote in Parliament is required for constitutional amendments in Malaysia.

== Status of religious freedom ==
Government in general supports Islamic religious establishment and it is the official policy to &quot;infuse Islamic values&quot; into the administration of the country.

However, Sunday which is the Christian traditional holiday is the official weekend holiday in the Federal Territories and ten out of thirteen states, unlike practices in Middle Eastern Muslim countries. The exception are the states of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu, where the weekend falls on Friday and Saturday. Most Muslims in Malaysia accept this, although some have expressed disquiet since the most holy period in a Muslim&#x27;s week is between Thursday evening and Friday afternoon, when the congregational Jumaat prayer is held. The practice of having Sunday as the weekend holiday is a departure from traditional Islamic practices, dating to British colonial days when the British started bringing in non-Muslim immigrants into the country.

In May 2001, the government decided not to approve the Falun Gong Preparatory Committee&#x27;s application to register as a legal organisation. This action is believed to be more related to the government&#x27;s wish to improve relations with China rather than an attempt to undermine the Falun Gong in favour of Islam. The government has not prevented Falun Gong members from carrying out their activities in public.

For Muslim children, religious education according to a government-approved curriculum is compulsory in public schools. There are no restrictions on homeschooling, although primary school is compulsory. However, private schools and colleges do have some legal requirements.

Several religious holidays are recognised as official holidays, including Hari Raya Puasa (Muslim), Hari Raya Haji (Muslim), the Milad un Nabi (Muslim), Wesak Day (Buddhist), Deepavali (Hindu), Thaipusam (Hindu), Christmas (Christian), and, in Sabah and Sarawak, Good Friday (Christian).

Judaism is not a recognized religion in Malaysia, and movements within the religion which incorporate political Zionism and even non-Zionist Jewish movements such as classical Judaism that are rooted in nationhood are either hindered or outrightly criminalized. In 2017 a Christian Zionist event called Jerusalem&#x27;s Jubilee was canceled by the authorities. One of the reasons cited by the Federal Police was that &quot;celebrating Israel’s occupation of Palestine offended Malaysians.&quot; Besides that, the organizers of the event were regarded as being insensitive because they used Jewish symbols such as the menorah and the Hebrew word Shalom and thus were also perceived as promoting Jewish culture. Such insensitivity, which may not necessarily be Zionistic, can be seen as seditious and thus have legal ramifications. Individuals who express support for the state of Israel openly can be prosecuted under Section 4(1)(a) of the Sedition Act. Arrest and investigations have been made in the past. The sedition law prescribes a maximum fine of RM5,000 or a jail sentence of three years for a convicted first-time offender, or both, and raises the jail term to five years for subsequent offenses. Jewish prayer items such as a Torah scroll delivered into the country may be confiscated by customs [if it was made known to them that its purpose was for the observance of Judaism]; thus (in reality) the practice of Judaism be it Zionist or not is hindered by the government. In an interview with Al-Jazeera in 2016 Tun Dr Mahathir Muhamad (4th &amp; 7th Prime Minister) conflated all Jews with the State of Israel and reaffirmed his statement that Jews rule the world by proxy and that they get others to die and fight for them. In a sermon prepared by the Federal Territory Islamic Affairs Department (JAWI) in 2012 it was stated that Jews are to be regarded as the main enemy of Muslims in the context of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. In 1984 the New York Philharmonic Orchestra had to cancel its visit to Malaysia after the Malaysian Information Minister demanded that a composition by American-Jewish composer Ernest Bloch, be eliminated from their program. That incident had nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, only a disturbing rejection of all things Jewish. 

===Inter-faith efforts in Malaysia===

In April 2002, the Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) initiated an interfaith dialogue aimed at promoting better understanding and respect among the country&#x27;s different religious groups. Participants included representatives from the Malaysian Islamic Development Department, the Malaysian Ulama Association, and the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST).

In early 2005, much debate was stirred up by a proposed Inter-Faith Commission put forward by various individuals, some of which included academics and lawyers from the Bar Council.

The steering committee behind the proposal for a draft bill for the commission organised a national conference that saw about 200+ people from all religious backgrounds attending it. There they hashed out the framework for a commission that could advise the relevant parties on the many interfaith issues that arise in pluralistic Malaysia such as conversion from Islam to another faith, which is deemed as apostasy in Malaysia.

PAS, member of parliament Dzulkefly Ahmad, stated that he is against religious pluralism saying that it has &quot;relativised&quot; truth claims, by implying that Islam is the same as other religions. Dr. Ahmad went on to make a distinction between promoting relativism of religions and co-operation with people in a &quot;multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-cultural, and multi-lingual&quot; society, and that the latter was necessary to build a strong country.

After much coverage in the local newspapers, the draft bill was put on hold by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, due to the controversy surrounding it.

==Conversion to Islam==

===Marriage and divorce===
A non-Muslim person who wishes to marry a Muslim person must convert to Islam before the marriage can be recognised as legally valid. A marriage between two non-Muslims (civil law marriages), however, will not become void after one spouse subsequently converts to Islam.

In 2006, T. Saravanan, a Muslim convert, sought to dissolve his marriage with his non-Muslim wife via the Syariah Court. His wife, R. Subashini, applied to Kuala Lumpur High Court for an injunction against her husband seeking divorce in the Syariah Court. The High Court dismissed her application. This was affirmed in the Court of Appeal, where the court also ordered Subashini to take her case to the Syariah Court. As of September 2007, their case is pending in the Federal Court after an appeal by Subashini. Subashini is also seeking to stop or declare void the conversion of their children. As of 27 December 2007, R. Subashini failed in an attempt to stop her husband from divorcing her in an Islamic court. She also failed to persuade the federal court her husband should be banned from converting their four-year-old son to Islam. The appeal was rejected on a technicality but court added that she would be able to try again in a few months.

===Voluntary conversion of minors===
Conversion to other faiths is allowed in Malaysia once one has reached an age of majority. A minor may not convert to another faith without explicit permission of his or her guardian as described in the Guardianship of Infants Act (1961) and the Federal Constitution (Articles 11 (1) and 12 (3) and (4)).

This case was tested by Teoh Eng Huat vs Kadhi mot of Pasir Mas Kelantan in 1986. Teoh Eng Huat&#x27;s daughter was a ward of the state. She married a Muslim. Hence then a minor, converted to Islam. The high court ruled that the father&#x27;s right to decide the religion and upbringing of the infant is allowed &quot;subject to the condition that it does not conflict with the principles of the infant&#x27;s choice of religion guaranteed to her under the Federal Constitution&quot;. Through the proceedings, Susie Teoh never appeared in court to testify.

The decision was over-ruled on appeal to the Supreme Court, who held &quot;in all the circumstances and in the wider interests of the nation no infant shall have the automatic right to receive instruction relating to any other religion other than (her) own without the permission of the parent or guardian&quot;.

The Supreme Court further held that this was &quot;only of academic interest&quot; as Susie Teoh was no longer a minor at the time of hearing.

In response several states (Islamic laws are passed by individual states) passed laws providing for conversion by 15 (defined as &quot;baligh&quot; in Islam or the age of puberty). Federal law still provides for the age of majority as 18.

===Automatic conversion of minors following parental conversion===
The state of Selangor passed a legal amendment in 1989 that if an adult converts to Islam, any infant children become converted at the same moment. This passed over the opposition of the Malaysian Chinese Association and the Democratic Action Party, and became law. However, after public outcry, it was quietly removed by its non-inclusion in future amendments of the state bill.

===Conversion of minor by one parent===
In the case of Chang Ah Mee v Jbt. Hal Ehwal Agama Islam (2003) heard in the Sabah High Court, the father converted to Islam and converted the child to Islam without consent or knowledge of the mother, Chang Ah Mee, on 28 July 1998. The mother gained custody of the child on 13 November 1998 and subsequently sued to declare the conversion void.

The court determined that as a state court, it had jurisdiction over all state matters even those concerning Islam. Further, based upon the Federal Constitution (article 12), The Guardianship of Infants Ordinance (Sabah) 1999, The Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act, 1976 and The Administration of Islamic Law Enactment 1992 (Sabah) determined the conversion of a two-year-old child to be void.

In 2003, this issue became prominent again in the case of Shamala Sathiyaseelan v Dr. Jeyaganesh C. Mogarajah. In the first hearing before the High Court, Shamala Sathiyaseelan sought (1) to bring committal proceedings against the father of the infants for breach of the interim custody order of the High Court of 17 April 2003, and (2) to declare that she was not bound by any decisions, order or proceedings of the syariah court.

Earlier the High Court had granted custody to Shamala Sathiyaseelan with access for the father. He failed to return the children to her on 25 May 2003. Shamala and Jeyaganesh were married under Hindu rites registered under the jurisdiction of the Law Reform Act. The husband converted to Islam on 19 November 2002. On 25 November 2002 he converted the children without the mother&#x27;s knowledge or consent. They were still not divorced at the time.

Without knowledge of Shamala he then obtained a custody order in the syariah court on 30 January 2003.
The High Court ruled that the custody order issued by the syariah court &quot;did not change the interim civil court order&quot;. They ruled that the syariah court order &quot;is not binding on the plaintiff wife who is non-Muslim&quot;. The interim custody order of the High Court and proceedings were binding on the now Muslim husband as matters arising out of the Hindu marriage registered under the Law Reform Act. As his Hindu wife did not file for divorce, she remains &quot;his unconverted wife&quot; under this law.

On 13 April 2004 Shamala once again went to the high court. This time to seek an order that the conversion of the infants was void. As in Chang Ah Mee, she cited the Federal Constitution (Article 12), the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961 and the Administration of Islamic Law (Federal Territories) Act, 1993.

The Guardianship of Infants Act for the Federal Territories differed from that of Sabah in one aspect as it used the term &quot;parent or guardian&quot; and not &quot;both parents or a guardian&quot; as in AMLE Sabah.

In this case the High Court ruled that only the consent of one parent is required in the conversion to Islam of a person below 18 in the Federal Territories.

Article 12(4) of the Federal Constitution reads &quot;For the purposes of cl. (3) the religion of a person under the age of eighteen years shall be decided by his parent or guardian.&quot;

The High Court interpreted the term parent to mean father. The equality of rights granted to both parents under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1961 was held inapplicable on the Muslim father.

In its judgement the High Court held the fatwa or the Mufti of the Federal Territory as persuasive (legal term). The Mufti stated that the father had the right to unilaterally convert the infants to Islam.

Shamala once again went to the high court on 20 July 2004 to apply inter alia for custody, care and control of the infants. The court awarded it with access for the father. In its judgement, it stated that &quot;the right of religious practice of the two infant children shall be exercised equally by both parents&quot; based on the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961. This was in spite of the earlier ruling that this act does not apply to Jeyaganesh who was now a Muslim.

The court also held that the applicable law at the time of conversion was civil law. It even ruled that the infants were &quot;still Hindus at the time of conversion&quot; and that the father should have consulted the mother before converting the infants.

However the court explicitly cautioned the mother from &quot;influencing the infants&#x27;
religious belief by teaching them her articles of faith or by making them eat pork&quot; or she would risk losing her children. The rationale given was that the court &quot;cannot run away from the fact that the two infant children are now muallaf&quot; (converts to Islam).

As the case has gained prominence various religious organisations, human rights organisations and women&#x27;s issues organisations have registered watching briefs. En. Haris Bin Mohamed Ibrahim has registered a watching brief on behalf of the Women&#x27;s Aid Organisation, (WAO), All Women&#x27;s Action Society (AWAM), Women&#x27;s Center for Change, Penang (WCC) and Sisters in Islam (SIS). A. Kanesalingam, held watching brief for the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism (MCCBCHS). Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Bar Council are also holding watching briefs for this case. The various organisations holding watching brief in this case now call themselves loosely Article 11 after the article of the Federal Constitution guaranteeing freedom of religion.

In 2014, the Seremban High Court over-ruled a Shariah Court, granting custody of Muslim children to their Hindu mother over that of their father who converted to Islam. However the father Izwan Viran Abdullah abducted the son from the mother after the ruling, and in which the police refused to help the mother retrieve the son citing the original Shariah custody ruling. The police inaction was criticised by Women&#x27;s Aid Organisation and both governing and opposition politicians.

== Conversion from Islam ==
Muslims who wish to convert from Islam face severe obstacles. For Muslims, particularly ethnic Malays, the right to leave the Islamic faith and adhere to another religion is a controversial question. The legal process of conversion is also unclear; in practice it is very difficult for Muslims to change their religion legally.

In 1999 the High Court ruled that secular courts have no jurisdiction to hear applications by Muslims to change religions. According to the ruling, the religious conversion of Muslims lies solely within the jurisdiction of Islamic courts.

The issue of Muslim apostasy is very sensitive. In 1998 after a controversial incident of attempted conversion, the Government stated that apostates (i.e., Muslims who wish to leave or have left Islam for another religion) would not face government punishment so long as they did not defame Islam after their conversion. However, whether the very act of conversion was an &quot;insult to Islam&quot; was not clarified at the time. The Government opposes what it considers deviant interpretations of Islam, maintaining that the &quot;deviant&quot; groups&#x27; extreme views endanger national security. In 2005 international media attention focused on the Sky Kingdom sect whose founder Ayah Pin claimed to be God, and whose members – mostly Malays – were accordingly charged with religious &quot;deviancy&quot; and &quot;humiliating Islam.&quot;

In the past, the Government imposed restrictions on certain Islamic groups, primarily the small number of Shi&#x27;a. The Government continues to monitor the activities of the Shi&#x27;a minority.

In April 2000, the state of Perlis passed a sharia law subjecting Islamic &quot;deviants&quot; and apostates to 1 year of &quot;rehabilitation&quot; (under the Constitution, religion, including sharia law, is a state matter). Leaders of the opposition Islamic party, PAS, have stated the penalty for apostasy – after the apostates are given a period of time to repent and they do not repent – is death.

Many Muslims who have converted to Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, other religions or irreligion (such as atheism or agnosticism) lead &quot;double lives&quot;, hiding their new faith from friends and family.

General interpretation about the freedom of religion as described in the constitution in Malaysia is that a person has a right to practice his or her religion freely. This freedom does not grant a person a right to change his or her religion &quot;at a whim and fancy&quot;. For example, a Muslim who wants to convert to another religion must get an explicit permission from a syariah court. The syariah courts rarely grant such requests, except in cases where a person has actually lived his or her whole adult life as a person of different religion, and only wants to change the official documents to reflect this fact. The Islamic interpretation of the situation is that only the syariah courts can decide who is a Muslim and who is not. A person does not have such freedom, and so cannot have a say in the judgement given in a syariah court.

The Lina Joy case challenged this view of the situation by taking the problem of apostasy to the Federal Court in 2007. Lina Joy lost the case and was denied identification as a Christian on her identification card. This cleared the situation about the overlapping areas of jurisdiction between the Islamic and the secular courts in Malaysia.

Government figures claim that the sharia courts of Malaysia received 863 applications to leave Islam between 2000 and 2010; only 168 people were granted permission to do so.

===Apostasy under state law===

As Malaysia is a federation, certain matters, such as religion, are handled by state governments. There is subsequently some amount of divergence between different states in the treatment of converts from Islam. Apostasy is not a federal crime. Civil rights group G25 stated in January 2020 that, although apostasy is a &#x27;major sin in Islam&#x27;, Muslims have freedom of worship under the Federal Constitution, just like all other citizens of Malaysia, so the various state laws prohibiting apostasy should be struck down. The group emphasised that other Malaysians are also allowed to change their religion, and pointed to other Muslim-majority countries such as Morocco, where apostasy isn&#x27;t a crime for Muslims either.

==== Legal ====
The states of Negeri Sembilan, Perlis and Selangor allow Muslims to leave Islam after a process of counselling, in which they are repeatedly asked to repent, and if they refuse, a sharia court may declare the person no longer a Muslim.

*Negeri Sembilan: Section 119 Administration of The Religion of Islam (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 2003 under the chapter of “Renunciation of the Religion of Islam” allows a Muslim change his or her religion for a &#x27;reasonable cause&#x27;. A convert must first apply to the Shariah Court for a declaration that he or she is no longer a Muslim; the convert will then be counselled for about a year by a Mufti. If, after this period, the convert still wants to convert, the judge may permit the application. In 2006, the Negeri Sembilan Court also permitted Wong Ah Kiu, a convert from Islam to Buddhism legally known as Nyonya binti Tahir, to be buried in the Buddhist fashion, although her conversion had not been legally recognised while she was still alive. The case marked the first time non-Muslims had testified in a Shariah court in Malaysia. Statistics indicate that has the largest number of converts, with 840 applications made to officially renounce Islam in 2005, 62 of which succeeded.
* Perlis: Section 10 of the Perlis Islamic Faith Protection Enactment 2000 enables a Muslim to apply for apostasy. The Aqidah Rehabilitation Centre is given a role to advise the applicant to repent during a counselling process, which is called &#x27;Istitabah&#x27;. After the counselling, a sharia court judge will once again advise the applicant to repent, but if he refuses to do so, and &#x27;the judge is satisfied that the person has no liability or obligation under the Islamic Family Law, [the judge will] declare that the person is no longer a Muslim and order his release.&#x27;
* Selangor: after applying to leave Islam, a Muslim needs to undergo counselling and advice by an appointed committee before a decision is made by the shariah court to declare the applicant as no longer Muslim.

==== Illegal ====
In the states Kelantan and Terengganu, apostasy by a Muslim is a crime punishable by death and forfeiture of property; however, federal law prohibits the death penalty from being carried out. In the states Malacca, Pahang, Perak, and Sabah, apostasy, attempted apostasy or being an accomplice to apostasy of someone else is a crime punishable by various measures ranging from a fine of up to MR 5,000, imprisonment (up to 3 years), or detention in an Islamic rehabitation centre (up to 3 years). In Pahang, apostates can be lashed six times with canes as well:
* Kelantan: &#x27;Apostasy&#x27; is a criminal offence punishable with death and forfeiture of property but it cannot be applied. &#x27;Attempted apostasy&#x27; is another criminal offence, carrying the maximum penalty of 36 months detention in an Islamic Rehabilitation Centre.
* Malacca: &#x27;Apostasy&#x27; is a criminal offence, carrying the maximum penalty of 6 months detention in an Islamic Rehabilitation Centre. &#x27;Accomplice to apostasy&#x27; is another criminal offence, carrying the maximum penalty of 3 years jail, a RM 5,000 fine, or both.
* Pahang: &#x27;Attempted apostasy&#x27; is a criminal offence, carrying the maximum penalty of 3 years jail, six lashes, a RM 5,000 fine, or a combination.
* Perak: &#x27;Apostasy&#x27; is a criminal offence, carrying the maximum penalty of 2 years jail, a RM 3,000 fine, or both.
* Sabah: &#x27;Attempted apostasy&#x27; is a criminal offence, carrying the maximum penalty of 36 months detention in an Islamic Rehabilitation Centre.
* Terengganu: &#x27;Apostasy&#x27; is a criminal offence punishable with death and forfeiture of property but death penalty cannot be applied as this power has not been given to them by constitution. The accused has the option of repentance within 3 days to go free.

==== Unclear ====
* Kedah: The Administration of Muslim Law Enactment (1962) does not mention apostasy. Therefore, it is neither punishable nor officially possible to stop being a Muslim.
* Sarawak: There is currently no legal process by which to change one&#x27;s status from Muslim to something else. During an ongoing legal case in that started in 2015, involving three applicants who wanted to return to Christianity after divorcing or the death of their spouses and one applicant who converted to Christianity after marrying a Christian, the state government promised in 2018 to institute a legal process through which Muslims could apostatise.

===Lina Joy===

Lina Joy, who was born Azalina Jailani, converted from Islam to Christianity, arguing that it came under her right to freedom of religion under Article 11 of the Constitution of Malaysia. She first approached the National Registration Department (NRD) in February 1997, seeking permission to change her name to Lina Joy, and also her religious status. The application was rejected in August 1997 on the grounds that the Syariah Court had not granted permission for her to renounce Islam. In 1998, the NRD allowed the name change, but refused to change the religious status on her identity card.

Joy appealed against this decision in the High Court, arguing that she should not be subject to sharia law, having converted to Christianity. In April 2001, Judge Datuk Faiza Tamby Chik ruled that she could not change her religious identity, because ethnic Malays are defined as Muslims under the Constitution. Joy then took her case to the Court of Appeal. On 19 September 2005, the court ruled in a 2–1 majority decision against Joy. Justice Abdul Aziz and Justice Arifin Zakaria agreed that the NRD was correct in rejecting Joy&#x27;s application and said it was up to the Syariah Court to settle the issue (Justice Gopal Sri Ram stated that it was null and void). Joy further appealed to the Federal Court of Malaysia, the highest court and the court of last resort in Malaysia. The Federal Court heard the appeal in July 2006, and it was presided by the Chief Justice of Malaysia Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim, Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Richard Malanjum, and Federal Court Judge Alauddin Sheriff.

On 30 May 2007, the Federal Court, in a 2–1 decision, dismissed Joy&#x27;s appeal. The Court&#x27;s panel ruled that only the Syariah Court had the power to allow Joy to remove her religious designation of Islam from her national identity card. Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim and Federal Court judge Justice Alauddin Mohd Sharif delivered the majority decision dismissing her appeal. Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Justice Richard Malanjum dissented.

===Nyonya Tahir===
Wong Ah Kiu, legally known as Nyonya binti Tahir, died on 19 January 2006. When her family went to the local police office to file a notice of death, the officer on duty was reportedly confused by the fact that the identity card of the deceased identified her as a Muslim Malay, while her family were Buddhist Chinese. He later informed his superior, who contacted the Negeri Sembilan Religious Affairs Department. The Religious Affairs Department had the Tampin Syariah Court issue an injunction to put her burial on hold when they found out she was Malay; the Negeri Sembilan Islamic Affairs Council and Negeri Sembilan Islamic Affairs Department then filed an ex parte application with the Syariah High Court in Seremban the next day regarding her burial. The head of the Negeri Sembilan Religious Affairs Department came to her family&#x27;s house in person to present the order that she be buried in the Muslim fashion. However, the court, having heard testimony from her children that she lived and died as a Buddhist, ruled on the following Monday that Wong was a non-Muslim when she died, and permitted her family to proceed with Buddhist funeral rites. Wong was buried next to her husband in the Chinese cemetery in her birthplace of Simpang Ampat, Alor Gajah.

The case marked the first time that non-Muslims had testified in a Syariah court in Malaysia; though non-Muslims are not permitted to initiate cases in Syariah courts, there had never been any official bar to their offering testimony. Religious minorities were reportedly relieved by the decision, but one advocacy group stated that the decision showed that the courts were &quot;inconsistent in their protection&quot; of non-Muslims.
===Revathi Massosai===
Revathi Massosai is a Malaysian woman who was raised as a Hindu but her identity card designates her as a Muslim. She has declared her religion to be Hindu and has petitioned unsuccessfully to have the word &quot;Islam&quot; removed from her identity card. Massosai married a Hindu man, but her marriage is not recognised by the Malaysian government because of religious issues. Massosai was incarcerated for six months in an Islamic re-education camp because of her attempts to renounce Islam in favour of the Hindu religion. She was also denied the guardianship of her newborn baby and was not allowed to meet her Hindu husband.

===Persecution===
There have been a few high-profile incidences and accounts of persecution of people from Muslim backgrounds attempting to convert from the Islamic faith. Some notable cases include:
* Hilmy Mohd Noor
Hilmy Mohd Noor, in his book &quot;Circumcised Heart&quot;, describes his experiences during his detention under the Internal Security Act of Malaysia in what he described as resulting from religious persecution by Malaysian authorities. In the book, he also mentioned incidences of lobbying by some Muslims in his place of employment—a multinational oil company—to get his job terminated.
* Nur&#x27;aishah Bokhari
Nur&#x27;aishah Bokhari made a writ of habeas corpus by statutory declaration claiming that she was detained involuntarily by her own family members for wanting to convert out of Islam before marrying her Roman Catholic boyfriend. She subsequently escaped and has since left the country.
* Abdullah or Jeffrey
Jeffrey, also known as Abdullah and Or Boon Hua, 36, made the application on the grounds that he had not practiced Islamic teachings since converting to the religion 14 years ago.

In 2016, a court in Sarawak state allowed a Muslim to convert back to Christianity since he had become a Muslim when he was underage.

In March 2024, a controversy erupted in Malaysia after socks bearing the word &quot;Allah&quot; were sold at KK Super Mart, leading to legal charges against the store&#x27;s owner and supplier for wounding religious feelings and intensifying discussions on religious sensitivity in the country.

==Christian proselytisation==

===Proselytising===
Proselytising of Muslims by members of other religions is prohibited by federal law, even though Muslims may proselytise. It is prohibited in 10 of the 13 states (except Penang, Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territories) and can lead to lengthy jail sentences and many strokes of the &quot;rotan&quot; (whipping). Most Christian and a few other religious groups in Malaysia put a standard disclaimer on literature and advertisements stating &quot;For non-Muslims only&quot;.

=== Religious Materials ===
In 2002 the government banned the Bible in Malay (Alkitab) and in Iban (Bup Kudus). The Kudus uses the term &quot;Allah Taala&quot; for God. The ban has since been rescinded. Abdullah Badawi, when in office as Home Minister, claimed it was the work of an overzealous bureaucrat and he had the ban repealed personally.

Some states have laws that prohibit the use of Malay-language religious terms such as usage of the term &quot;Allah&quot; for God by Christians, but the authorities do not enforce them actively.

Distribution of other materials such as books or tapes translated into Bahasa Melayu (local Malay) or Indonesian is also discouraged. However, Malay-language Christian materials are available. Prior to the banning of the Bup Kudus in 2002, the distribution of Malay-language Christian materials faced few restrictions in East Malaysia.

=== Visas and other restrictions ===
In recent years, visas for foreign clergy no longer are restricted, and most visas were approved during the period covered by this report. Beginning in March 2000, representative non-Muslims were invited to sit on the immigration committee that approves such visa requests.

==Persecution of non-Sunni Muslims==

According to government figures there are about 40,000 Shiites living in Malaysia, however the unofficial figures put the numbers at more than 300,000. Shiites are subjected to persecutions and raids by various state religious authorities in Malaysia. This discrimination received religious legitimacy in 1996 when the Fatwa Committee for Religious Affairs issued a religious opinion (fatwa) that upheld the “orthodoxy” of Sunni Islam and branded Shi‘a Islam as “deviant.” In doing so, it prohibited Shi‘a from spreading their beliefs and distributing any electronic or print resources that espoused Shi‘i principles. Interestingly, this opinion overturned a 1984 decision from the same committee that deemed Shi‘ism acceptable in Malaysia. It caused many Shias to practice their religion underground.

In April 2009, the Selangor Islamic Religious Council of Malaysia issued a letter which forbade members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community to offer Friday prayers at their central mosque with immediate effect. Moreover, its failure by the Ahmadis to comply with the terms of the order will result in imprisonment of up to one year and/or a fine up to 3000 Malaysian ringgit. A large notice has been place outside the mosque which states &quot;Qadiani Bukan Agama Islam&quot; which translates to &quot;Qadiani [Ahmadiyyat] is not an Islamic Religion.&quot;

==Discrimination against atheists==

The state has come under criticism from human rights organisations for its discrimination against atheists. In August 2017, Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department Shahidan Kassim declared that &quot;atheism is against the Constitution and the basic human rights&quot; in Malaysia since &quot;there is no provision on atheism&quot; in the Constitution. Shahidan wanted atheists and atheist groups like the Kuala Lumpur chapter of Atheist Republic to be identified and hunted down. He also stated that &quot;we need to restore the faith back in them, especially for Muslims. Actually they don&#x27;t really want to be an atheist, but they lack knowledge about religion and that is why they are easily swayed to the new age teaching&quot;. Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department in charge of Islamic affairs, stated that the group Atheist Republic will be investigated.

==Places of worship==
The government generally respects non-Muslims&#x27; right of worship; however, state governments carefully control the building of non-Muslim places of worship and the allocation of land for non-Muslim cemeteries. Approvals for such permits sometimes are granted very slowly.

The Catholic Society of Shah Alam had been lobbying the state government for a permit to build a church in that city for more than 10 years. It was not until 2004 that the permit was finally granted. The church opened its doors on 10 September 2005.

The new pre-planned capital of Malaysia, Putrajaya, features a grand mosque as a prominent feature of the planned community. On 16 November 2005, Archbishop Murphy Pakiam announced that the Malaysian government had generously allocated a parcel of land in Putrajaya to the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur for building a Catholic church-run community centre. The Putrajaya Catholic Church Building Committee was set up on 3 October 2005. According to the committee, &quot;The architectural planning and design will conform to the Liturgical requirements complementing the ambience of Putrajaya&#x27;s lush greenery and landscape. We envisage the Putrajaya church to be a hallmark of the Catholic community in Malaysia and showcase the rich heritage of the Malaysian Catholics.&quot;

==Azan==
The first Islamic call to prayer or Azan (also spelt Adhan), known as &quot;subuh&quot; (or dawn), occurs between as early as 4.30 AM to as late as 6.15 AM (depending on which region, city and state) with the exact time drifting throughout the year. Most Malaysian businesses start work as early as 7 AM up till as late as 9 AM. Many mosques amplify the early prayer call by way of loud speakers, and while in some cases only a few neighbouring homes are affected, some large mosques (for example the State Mosque of Selangor which has speakers on its minarets) have prayer calls which can be heard in a large surrounding area.

In 2004 the Bar Council of Malaysia journal &quot;Infoline&quot; carried an article which questioned the need for the Azan as it was disturbing to non-Muslims and not needful. The article was condemned because Azan is a religious requirement.

In December 2004, Minister of Culture, Arts and Heritage Datuk Seri Utama Dr Rais Yatim mentioned in an interview that the Azan may be disturbing. He stated &quot;...the Muslim call for Subuh (dawn) prayer may disturb the sleep of non-Muslims but they have accepted this as a fundamental part of Islam. But how loud the volume of the PA system in the mosque should be, is another matter.&quot;

Excessive noise however is common matter of uneasiness among some Malaysians because non-Muslims also often practise rituals that cause much discomfort to others (Muslims and non-Muslims alike). Among these are Chinese funeral processions that are often accompanied by drums and cymbals, and other rituals not exclusive to the Chinese.

A local daily, The Star reported that a proposal by Kepong MP Dr Tan Seng Giaw to regulate the Azan so that it will not be too loud or disturb non-Muslims caused a stir in the Dewan Rakyat. Muslim MPs accused him of being insensitive and Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department Datuk Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz blasted the DAP member for allegedly trying to destroy the multi-religious tolerance in the country.

==Taxation==
In Malaysia, there is a rebate in income tax for money paid to the government in form of &quot;zakat&quot;, or the obligatory alms Muslims must give to the poor. However, money paid to other causes in the name of other religions under similar circumstances is given only income tax relief, and such relief is given only if the particular beneficiary has obtained approved status from the Malaysian Government, which is difficult in practice. Money donated to such approved beneficiary is only deducted from the income on which the amount of tax is based, while zakat is deducted from the amount of tax itself. For example, suppose a person earning RM 50,000 owes a tax of RM 3,000 and donates RM 1,000 to zakat, the whole of the RM 1,000 is directly deducted from the RM 3,000, whereas donations to other approved beneficiary would permit only a deduction of the RM 1,000 against the RM 50,000. The former being a tax credit and the latter being a tax deduction.

Zakat (or tithe) monies, however, are paid by Muslims directly to official organisations run by state governments. Receipts are issued out and must be submitted to apply for tax relief.
The zakat organisations themselves are governed by specific Islamic rulings defining the categories of people who qualify to receive the alms as well as the amount to be paid out by Muslims based on their income.

In contrast, charities in Malaysia are run privately by voluntary organisations, collecting voluntary donations from the general public, not compulsory tithes – thus the difference in treatment by the government.

Additionally, income tax relief granted to companies for donation made to tax exempt charities is restricted to 5% of the aggregate income of the company. Not all non-Muslim charities are granted tax exempt status, it is only given to registered and approved charities, partly to prevent abuse. There are stringent requirements to gain this advantage. Having earned this advantage these charities are further disadvantage in that their prospective donors are discouraged from donating monies to these charities because the donors are given tax relief for up to 5% of their aggregate income only.

==Inheritance under Sharia law==
Upon the death of a Muslim, his or her estate shall be distributed according to sharia law. This is called the &quot;Faraid&quot; or the Islamic law of Inheritance. A Muslim is allowed to make a will, called a &quot;wasiat&quot;, but only one-third of his estate shall be disposed of according to the will. Furthermore, the requirement under sharia law is that disposition according to wills shall not benefit any person opposed to Islam as a religion. This situation applies throughout Peninsula Malaysia and Sabah. In Sarawak, a Muslim testator may dispose one-third of his property to anyone he or she wishes.

==Freedom of expression==

=== Films ===
Movies which depict people considered prophets in Islam are generally censored or banned as the depiction of prophets is considered &quot;haraam&quot; (not allowed) under Islam. One notable case was the banning of &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; when its producers would not accept censorship of the character Moses (Musa in Islam).

However, in a more recent case, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was allowed, after the intervention of the Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, under strict conditions restricting its viewership to Christians with sales of tickets being carried out by various churches and para-church organisations.

In 2004, Yasmin Ahmad&#x27;s (herself a Malaysian Muslim) film &quot;Sepet&quot; was rejected by censors who asked that scenes be removed. 10 scenes were objectionable. Among objectionable material queried in the movie was why the movie did not depict any attempt to convert Jason (the Chinese non-Muslim main character) to Islam after he had fallen in love with a Malay girl.

In 2014 the biblical film Noah was banned by the Malaysian authorities reasoning that the film was un-Islamic.
===Print media===

On 10 December 2007, Malaysian authorities banned the Malay-language section of a Catholic weekly newspaper, The Catholic Herald due to its use of the word Allah, the name for God which Christians had used for hundreds of years in the country. Their reasoning is that the word Allah by Christians would confuse Malay Muslims. The Herald meanwhile, filed suit at the beginning of December following warnings that its permit could be revoked if it did not cease use of the word &quot;Allah&quot; in the Malay language section of its newspaper. Countering the Herald&#x27;s suit, the Malaysian security authorities on 30 December, warned its printing permit would not be renewed if it continued using the word &quot;Allah,&quot; which the government continued to say can only be used by Muslims.

The Catholic Church began its challenge of the government gag order prohibiting it from using the word &quot;Allah&quot; in its Herald-The Catholic Weekly- through a judicial review. The government had earlier argued that the church&#x27;s application is frivolous and had urged the court to throw it out but Madam Justice Lau Bee Lan disagreed and allowed the application by the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur, Datuk Murphy Pakiam, for leave to sue the government regarding the use of the word &quot;Allah&quot; to proceed. Three points that were raised in the lawsuit. The first is for the court to declare that the government&#x27;s action in prohibiting The Herald from using the word &quot;Allah&quot; is illegal and null and void. The second is for a court declaration that the Archbishop as publisher of The Herald is entitled to use the word &quot;Allah&quot; and lastly, that the court should declare that the word &quot;Allah&quot; is not exclusive to the religion of Islam.

=== Bibles and religious literature ===
* The Sabah Evangelical Church of Borneo also took legal action after the authorities banned the import of Christian books containing the word Allah.
* In January 2008, children&#x27;s Christian books with illustrations of prophets were confiscated from several bookstores around the country.
* In May 2008, Malaysian customs confiscated 3 Christian CDs with the words Allah written on them from a Christian Sarawakian lady, Jill Ireland bint Lawrence Bill. She challenged the confiscation of the CDs in court.
* In March 2010, the Malaysian Home Ministry seized 30,000 Malay bibles from a port in Kuching, Sarawak.
* In January 2014, the Selangor Islamic Religious department (Jais) raided the Bible Society of Malaysia and confiscated 320 Malay and Iban bibles, which catered for Sabah and Sarawak Christians.
* In October 2014, Malaysian Customs seized Christian books and CDs from a pastor at the low cost terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport who was on the way back to Sabah from Medan.

=== Individual words ===
Under subsection 48(3) and (4) of the Penang Islamic Religious Administration Enactment 2004, the Mufti of Penang state is allowed to pass legally binding religious rulings, or &quot;fatwa&quot;. In 2010, this power was used to pass a fatwa which would penalize non-Muslims for using the following words, or to write or publish them, in any form, version or translation in any language or for use in any publicity material in any medium:
&quot;&quot;Allah&quot;, &quot;Firman Allah&quot;, &quot;Ulama&quot;, &quot;Hadith&quot;, &quot;Ibadah&quot;, &quot;Kaabah&quot;, &quot;Qadhi&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Illahi&quot;, &quot;Wahyu&quot;, &quot;Mubaligh&quot;, &quot;Syariah&quot;, &quot;Qiblat&quot;, &quot;Haji&quot;, &quot;Mufti&quot;, &quot;Rasul&quot;, &quot;Iman&quot;, &quot;Dakwah&quot;, &quot;Wali&quot;, &quot;Fatwa&quot;, &quot;Imam&quot;, &quot;Nabi&quot;, &quot;Sheikh&quot;, &quot;Khutbah&quot;, &quot;Tabligh&quot;, &quot;Akhirat&quot;, &quot;Azan&quot;, &quot;Al Quran&quot;, &quot;As Sunnah&quot;, &quot;Auliya&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Karamah&quot;, &quot;Syahadah&quot;, &quot;Baitullah&quot;, &quot;Musolla&quot;, &quot;Zakat Fitrah&quot;, &quot;Hajjah&quot;, &quot;Taqwa&quot; and &quot;Soleh&quot;.&quot; This ruling caused uproar, particularly in the Sikh community, as Sikh religious texts use the term &quot;Allah&quot;, with members of the community calling the law unconstitutional. The ban was overturned in 2014, as Penang lawmakers decreed that the Penang Islamic Religious Administration Enactment law only gave the Mufti permission to pass &quot;fatwas&quot; for the Muslim community, and that these bans were not enforceable on non-Muslim individuals.

==Protests against religious freedom==

On 5 November 2006, a group of Muslims gathered outside the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, Silibin, in the town of Ipoh, Perak to protest an alleged conversion of Muslim Malays out of Islam. The allegation was spread via a text message that claimed the church would baptise a group of Muslim Malays. The message proved to be false as the church celebrated only a Holy Communion service for 110 Indian children. The message further alleged that a famous Malaysian sportsman Azhar Mansor was leaving Islam to embrace Christianity. The police had traced the message to a lady who had met Harussani Zakaria, mufti of the state of Perak in a meeting. He has stated that the message was to remain within the confines of the meeting but had made no attempt to verify the authenticity of the message nor report it to the police as converting Muslims is illegal under Malaysian law. On 17 November, Azhar Mansor declared that he had not renounced Islam, and Umno president Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that there should now be an end to the speculation.

== Destruction of religious property ==

===Destruction of Hindu temples===
Approximately nine percent of the population of Malaysia are Indians, of whom nearly 90 percent are practising Hindus. Indian settlers came to Malaysia from India in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

After a violent conflict in Penang between Hindus and Muslims in March 1998, the government announced a nationwide review of unlicensed Hindu temples and shrines. However, implementation was not vigorous and the program was not a subject of public debate. In April 2006, local authorities demolished several Hindu temples to make way for developmental projects. Their excuse was that these temples were unlicensed and squatting on government land.

Between April and May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus. On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.

The president of the Consumers Association of Subang and Shah Alam in Selangor had been helping to organise efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of Shah Alam from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as Hinduism.

On 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from Kuala Lumpur forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus. The &quot;Hindu Rights Action Force&quot;, a coalition of several NGO&#x27;s, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the Malaysian Prime Minister. Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built &quot;illegally&quot;. However, several of the temples are centuries old.

According to a lawyer for the Hindu Rights Action Task Force, a Hindu temple is demolished in Malaysia once every three weeks.

Malaysian Muslims have also grown more anti-Hindu over the years. In response to the proposed construction of a temple in Selangor, Muslims chopped off the head of a cow to protest, with leaders saying there would be blood if a temple was constructed in Shah Alam.

Laws in the country, especially those concerning religious identity, are generally slanted towards compulsion into converting to Islam.

=== Destruction of Chinese shrine ===

In February 2020, more than a dozen Selayang Municipal Council (MPS) enforcement officers tore down a Chinese shrine dedicated to &quot;Datuk Gong&quot; near Yu Xu Gong temple in Taman Bidara, Selayang. The shrine, which had stood at the end of the alley for close to 30 years, was torn down by MPS enforcement officers because according to the council, it was built illegally on government land.

=== Church attacks ===

The Metro Tabernacle, an Assemblies of God church in Desa Melawati, Kuala Lumpur was set on fire on 8 January 2010. While in Malacca, black paint was splashed on the outer wall of the Malacca Baptist Church in Durian Daun.

=== Mosque/prayer halls (Surau) attacks ===

There were also incidences of attacks being made onto Muslim places of worship. In January 2010, two separate prayer halls (surau) in Muar became targets of arson attacks. And as recent as August 2010, another prayer hall in Seremban was subjected to vandalism. The prayer hall was defaced by red paint and littered with alcohol bottles.

<doc id="322701" wikidata="Q868550" url="?curid=322701" title="French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission">
<text>The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, or CEA (French: Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives), is a French public government-funded research organisation in the areas of energy, defense and security, information technologies and health technologies. The CEA maintains a cross-disciplinary culture of engineers and researchers, building on the synergies between fundamental and technological research.

CEA is headed by a board headed by the general administrator (currently since 20 April 2018), advised by the high-commissioner for atomic energy (currently ). Its yearly budget amounts to €5.8 billion and its permanent staff is slightly over 21,000 persons.

== History ==
CEA was created in 1945; since then, the successive high-commissioners have been Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, , , Raoul Dautry, René Pellat, Bernard Bigot, Catherine Cesarsky, , and .

In December 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared that CEA should change its name from &quot;Commissariat à l’énergie atomique&quot; () to &quot;Commissariat à l’énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives&quot; (); this change took effect on 10 March 2010, when the decision was published in the &quot;Journal officiel de la République française&quot;.

== Research ==
It conducts fundamental and applied research into many areas, including the design of nuclear reactors, the manufacturing of integrated circuits, the use of radionucleides for curing illnesses, seismology and tsunami propagation, the safety of computerized systems, etc.

It has one of the top 100 supercomputers in the world, the &quot;Tera-100&quot;. TERA 100, first system designed and built in Europe to reach the petaflops in 2010, was ranked in 5th position in the worldwide TOP 500. CEA is now building TERA-1000 which is a key step in the implementation of their Exascale program for the computing needs that CEA would face by 2020.

In March 2016, Reuters published an article describing the &quot;Top 25 Global Innovators – Government&quot; and placed CEA as &quot;number one&quot; amongst &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Innovative Research Institutions.&quot;

== Organisation ==

CEA is divided into four &quot;directorates&quot;, or divisions:

=== Energies division (DES) ===
The (DES) comprises four institutes:
* Institut de recherche sur les systèmes nucléaires pour la production d’énergie bas carbone (IRESNE), in Cadarache
* Institut des sciences et technologies pour une économie circulaire des énergies bas carbone (ISEC), in Marcoule
* Institut des sciences appliquées et de la simulation pour les énergies bas carbone (ISAS), in CEA Saclay
* Institut de technico-économie des systèmes énergétiques (ITESE or I-Tésé)

=== Technological research division (DRT) ===
The (DRT), known also as CEA Tech division, is divided between two CEA sites, at Saclay and Grenoble. CEA Tech focuses on technological research and development in the field of energy, IT (both hardware and software) and healthcare informatics. It plays an active role in transferring knowledge and research to industry.

The CEA Tech division is further divided into three research institutes:

* The CEA-Leti lab works mainly on micro/nano technologies and specializes in microsystems, biotech, photonics and nanoelectronics. It is located mainly in Grenoble, France.
* The CEA-List lab works mainly on systems and software-intensive technology and specializes in embedded systems, sensors and big data, and advanced manufacturing. It is located mainly in Paris-Saclay, France.
* The lab works mainly on cutting edge technologies related to energy and nanomaterials. It specializes in building solar, carbon-free transports, biomass-hydrogen and nano materials-nanotechnologies.

The current director of DRT since january 2023 is Julie Galland.

=== Fundamental research division (DRF) ===
The (DRF) consists of 9 institutes:
* Institut de biologie François Jacob (JACOB) in CEA Fontenay-aux-Roses
* Institut des sciences du vivant Frédéric Joliot (JOLIOT) in CEA Saclay
* Institut Rayonnement-Matière de Saclay (IRAMIS) in CEA Saclay
* Institut de recherche sur les lois fondamentales de l&#x27;Univers (Irfu) in CEA Saclay
* Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l&#x27;environnement (LSCE) in CEA Saclay
* Institut de recherche interdisciplinaire de Grenoble (IRIG) in 
* Institut de physique théorique (IPhT) in CEA Saclay
* Institut de Recherche sur la Fusion par confinement Magnétique (IRFM) in Cadarache
* Institut de Biosciences et de Biotechnologies d&#x27;Aix-Marseille (BIAM) in Cadarache

The current DRF director since 2 november 2019 is Elsa Cortijo.

=== Military applications division (DAM) ===

The (DAM) builds the nuclear weapons of the French military and designs the power plants for the nuclear submarines of the French Navy.

== Facilities ==

===Civilian research centres===
* CEA Saclay, Essonne (, headquarters since 2006) and the associated National Laboratory GANIL at Caen - Calvados 
* CEA Fontenay-aux-Roses, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Hauts-de-Seine
* , Grenoble (Polygone Scientifique), Isère
* , Cadarache, Bouches-du-Rhône
* CEA Valrhô, Marcoule and Pierrelatte, Gard

===Civilian emergency organizations===
* Groupe INTRA

===Research centres for military applications===
The sites of the DAM include:

* , Bruyères-le-Châtel, Essonne
* CEA Valduc, Côte-d&#x27;Or
* INBS PN CADARACHE, in Cadarache
* CEA Cesta, Gironde
* CEA Gramat
* CEA Le Ripault, Indre-et-Loire

==Spin-off companies==
CEA has spun off multiple companies, some being partial subsidiaries or where CEA has minority interest. Some such companies are listed below:
* Orano
* STMicroelectronics
* Soitec
* LYNRED (formerly Sofradir)
* It owned Areva
* Kalray

== CEA in Academics ==

=== University of Paris-Saclay ===
CEA has played an active role in research, development and innovation in the four main areas of low-carbon energies (nuclear and renewable), technologies for information and health technologies, very large research infrastructures (TGIR), and defense and global security.

Moreover, two of the ten CEA centers across France have joined with the University of Paris-Saclay to develop high quality research and training. The centers which form a part of the University of Paris-Saclay include:
* CEA Saclay Center, which conducts research mainly in areas related to climate and environment, materials science, nuclear energy, life sciences and technological research
* CEA Fontenay-aux-Roses Center, which conducts research and innovation in areas related to imaging and biomedical technologies

(Since 2017, these two centers merged into CEA Paris-Saclay center, and are now referred to as sites in that center.)

The CEA researchers involved in the University of Paris-Saclay represent over 20% of the university&#x27;s research potential, particularly in the field of physics and engineering. CEA maintains a strong presence in training to master and engineer level by administering INSTN, wherein various courses are taught by its researchers.

CEA has around 400 researchers who hold an accreditation to supervise research, making it a significant contributor to the research and doctoral programs of the University Paris-Saclay.

=== INSTN ===
The INSTN, &quot;Institut national des sciences et techniques nucléaires&quot; (National Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology) is a public higher education institution administered by the CEA (French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission) under the joint authority of the Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research, the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and the Digital Sector and the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs.

=== Others ===
* Atos, ENS Paris-Saclay and CEA launched an academic partnership in 2016.

<doc id="322704" wikidata="Q5723458" url="?curid=322704" title="William E. Fairbairn">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel William Ewart Fairbairn (; 28 February 1885 – 20 June 1960) was a British soldier and police officer. He developed hand-to-hand combat methods for the Shanghai Police during the interwar period, as well as for the Allied special forces during World War II. He created his own fighting system known as Defendu. Notably, this included innovative pistol shooting techniques and the development of the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife.

==Military career==
Fairbairn served with the Royal Marine Light Infantry starting in 1901, and joined the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) in 1907. He served in one of the red light districts. During his service with the International Police in Shanghai, Fairbairn reportedly engaged in hundreds of street fights in the course of his duties during a twenty-year career. Much of his body, arms, legs, torso, even the palms of his hands, were covered with scars from knife wounds from those fights. Fairbairn later created, organised, trained and commanded a special anti-riot squad for the Shanghai police force. He also developed numerous firearms training courses and items of police equipment, including a special metal-lined bulletproof vest designed to stop high-velocity bullets from the 7.63x25mm Mauser pistol.

During World War II, he was recruited by the British Special Operations Executive as an Army officer; he was given the nickname &quot;Dangerous Dan&quot;. Together with fellow close-combat instructor Eric Sykes, Fairbairn was commissioned with the General List in 1941. Fairbairn and Sykes were both commissioned as second lieutenants on 15 July 1940. He trained British, American and Canadian Commandos and No. 2 Dutch Troop 10th Inter-Allied Commando forces, US Rangers candidates, and personnel of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), mainly for close-combat, pistol-shooting and knife-fighting techniques. Fairbairn emphasised the necessity of forgetting any idea of gentlemanly conduct or fighting fair: &quot;Get tough, get down in the gutter, win at all costs... I teach what is called &#x27;Gutter Fighting.&#x27; There&#x27;s no fair play, no rules except one: &quot;kill or be killed&quot;,&quot; he declared. One of his pupils was Raymond Westerling, who fought behind enemy lines in Burma and Indonesia.

In 1941, he appeared in a training movie titled &quot;Unarmed Combat&quot;, demonstrating many of the strikes, holds and throws of Defendu, for use by the Home Guard, Commandos, and military services. This training movie was narrated by actor David Niven, who had joined the Commandos early in the war, and was trained by Fairbairn himself. In 1942, Fairbairn appeared, again uncredited, in an OSS training movie titled &quot;OSS Training Center&quot;, directed by John Ford. Fairbairn again demonstrated unarmed combat, and also his version of &quot;Point Shooting&quot;, later adopted and refined by Rex Applegate for use by the U.S. Army.

For his achievements in training OSS personnel, Fairbairn was promoted eventually to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel by the end of the war, and received the U.S. Legion of Merit (Officer grade) at the specific request of OSS-founder &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan.

==Martial arts==
After joining the SMP, he studied boxing, wrestling, savate, tenshinshinyo ry jiu jitsu from Okada-sensei, Kodokan judo in which he gained a 2nd dan black belt, and then Chinese martial arts. He developed his own fighting system—Defendu—and taught it to members of that police force in order to reduce officer fatalities. He described this system as based primarily on his personal experience, which according to police records included some 600 non-training fights, by his retirement at age 55 from the job of Assistant Commissioner in 1940.

In 1951, he went to Cyprus to train police and in 1952 (and 1956) Fairbairn provided training to the Singapore Police Force&#x27;s Riot Squad unit, which is now Police Tactical Unit.

==Weapons innovations==
Together with Eric A. Sykes, Fairbairn developed innovative pistol shooting techniques and handgun specifications for the SMP which were later disseminated by their book &quot;Shooting to Live With the One-Hand Gun&quot; (1942), along with various other police innovations such as riot batons, armoured vests, and other equipment.

He is perhaps known best for designing the famous &quot;Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife&quot;, or &#x27;Commando&#x27; knife, a stiletto-style fighting dagger used by British Special Forces in the Second World War, and featured in his textbook &quot;Scientific Self-Defence&quot;. Fairbairn also designed the lesser known Smatchet, and collaborated on the design of several other combat knife designs.

<doc id="322706" wikidata="Q234880" url="?curid=322706" title="Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)">
<text>Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 45 in F minor, known as the &quot;Farewell&quot; Symphony (; modern orthography: ), is a symphony dated 1772 on the autograph score. A typical performance of the symphony lasts around twenty-five minutes.

The autograph manuscript of the symphony is preserved in the National Széchényi Library in Budapest, and was published in facsimile editions in 1959 (Verlag der Ungarischen Akademie der Wissenschaften) and 2010 (Laaber-Verlag).

==History==
The tale of how the symphony was composed was told by Haydn in old age to his biographers Albert Christoph Dies and Georg August Griesinger.

At that time, Haydn&#x27;s patron Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy was resident, together with all his musicians and retinue, at his favorite summer palace at Eszterháza in rural Hungary. The stay there had been longer than expected, and most of the musicians had been forced to leave their wives back at home in Eisenstadt, about a day&#x27;s journey away. Longing to return, the musicians appealed to their Kapellmeister for help. The diplomatic Haydn, instead of making a direct appeal, put his request into the music of the symphony: during the final &quot;adagio&quot; each musician stops playing, snuffs out the candle on his music stand, and leaves in turn, so that at the end, there are just two muted violins left (played by Haydn himself and his concertmaster, Luigi Tomasini). Esterházy seems to have understood the message: the court returned to Eisenstadt the day following the performance.

==The music==
===Key===
The work is in F minor. According to James Webster, this choice was unusual; indeed the Farewell Symphony is apparently the only known 18th-century symphony ever written in this key.

The symphony could not be performed without the purchase of some special equipment: on 22 October 1772 Haydn signed an order (preserved in the scrupulously maintained Esterházy archives) for two special half-step slides () for use by the horn players. These slightly lengthened the horn&#x27;s tubing, permitting the instrument to be used to play in keys a semitone lower than usual. The horn of the time was the valveless natural horn, which needed to be adjusted with inserted crooks to play in different keys. Haydn&#x27;s purchase order is part of the evidence that the symphony was completed in the fall of 1772.

===Movements===
The piece is written for two oboes, bassoon, two horns (in A, F♯ and E), and strings (violins in two sections (four in the final Adagio), violas, cellos and double basses).

The turbulent first movement of the work opens in a manner typical of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; period, with descending minor arpeggios in the first violins against syncopated notes in the second violins and held chords in the winds. The movement can be explained structurally in terms of sonata form, but it departs from the standard model in a number of ways (just before the recapitulation, for example, new material is introduced, which might have been used as the second subject in the exposition in a more conventional work). Also, the exposition moves to C minor, the dominant minor, rather than the more usual relative major.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;

The second, slow, movement in A major and time is also in sonata form. It begins with a relaxed melody played by muted violins, featuring a repeated &quot;hiccuping&quot; motif. The mood gradually becomes more somber and meditative with an alternation between major and minor modes, resembling many similar passages in the later work of Schubert. There follows a series of dissonant suspensions carried across the bar line, which are extended to extraordinary lengths by Haydn when the same material appears in the recapitulation. James Webster hears this music as programmatic, expressing the yearning for home.

The following minuet is in the key of F major; its main peculiarity is that the final cadence of each section is made very weak (falling on the third beat), creating a sense of incompleteness.

The last movement begins as a characteristic Haydn finale in fast tempo and cut time, written in sonata form in the home key of F minor. The rhythmic intensity is increased at one point through the use of unison bariolage in the first violin part. The music eventually reaches the end of the recapitulation in a passage that sounds very much as if it were the end of the symphony but suddenly breaks off in a dominant cadence.

What follows is a long coda-like section, in essence a second slow movement, which is highly unusual in Classical symphonies and was probably quite surprising to the Prince. (It is in this section of the last movement where the musicians stop playing, snuff out their candles, and leave in turn.). This is written in time, modulates from A major to F major (pivoting between the two with C minor/major), and includes a bit of stage business that may not be obvious to a listener hearing a recorded performance: several of the musicians are given little solos to play, after which they snuff out the candle on their music stand and take their leave; other musicians leave without solos. The order of departure is: first oboe and second horn (solos), bassoon (no solo), second oboe and first horn (solos), double bass (solo), cello (no solo), orchestral violins (solos; first chair players silent), viola (no solo). As the number of remaining instruments dwindles, the sound emanating from the orchestra gradually becomes audibly thinner. The first chair violinists remain to complete the work. The ending is a kind of deliberate anticlimax and is usually performed as a very soft &quot;pianissimo&quot;.

==Reception==
The work is probably one of the more familiar and frequently performed of the symphonies from the earlier period of Haydn&#x27;s career. Haydn himself quoted the opening of the first movement in his Symphony No. 85, suggesting he knew that his audience would recognize it. For the musicologist James Webster, the work deserves its fame not so much for its affiliated anecdote but rather in its own right as superlative music, and he devoted to it a substantial book (Webster 1991) analyzing it in great detail and placing it in its musicological context.

<text>A smatchet is a short, heavy fighting knife in overall length (including grip). It was designed by William E. Fairbairn during World War II.

==Design==
Though described in the Office of Strategic Services catalogue as a cross between a machete and a bolo, it was actually based on the Royal Welch Fusiliers Trench Knife of World War I, and was designed as a pure combat knife. It has a broad, leaf-shaped blade sharpened the full length on one side, and from the tip to half of the other side. The entire blade is coated with a dull matte finish to prevent detection at night from stray reflections.

==Use==
According to Fairbairn, the smatchet was an ideal close-combat weapon for those not armed with a rifle and bayonet:

The smatchet was used by British and American special forces (Special Air Service and Office of Strategic Services, respectively) during World War II.

In the late 1980s, Col. Rex Applegate licensed a modified version of the smatchet he and Fairbairn designed late in World War II. He called it the &quot;Applegate-Fairbairn Combat Smatchet&quot;.

<doc id="322713" wikidata="Q478225" url="?curid=322713" title="Croke Park">
<text>Croke Park (, ) is a Gaelic games stadium in Dublin, Ireland. Named after Archbishop Thomas Croke, it is referred to as Croker by GAA fans and locals. It serves as both the principal national stadium of Ireland and headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Since 1891 the site has been used by the GAA to host Gaelic sports, including the annual All-Ireland finals in Gaelic football and hurling.

A major expansion and redevelopment of the stadium ran from 1991 to 2005, raising capacity to its current 82,300 spectators. This makes Croke Park the fourth-largest stadium in Europe, and the second-largest not usually used for association football in Europe.

Along with other events held at the stadium include the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2003 Special Olympics, and numerous musical concerts. In 2012, Irish pop group Westlife sold out the stadium in a record-breaking time: less than 5 minutes. From 2007 to 2010, Croke Park hosted home matches of the Ireland national rugby union team and the Republic of Ireland national football team, while their new Aviva Stadium was constructed. This use of Croke Park for non-Gaelic sports was controversial and required temporary changes to GAA rules. In June 2012, the stadium hosted the closing ceremony of the 50th International Eucharistic Congress during which Pope Benedict XVI gave an address over a video link.

==City and Suburban Racecourse==
The area now known as Croke Park was owned in the 1880s by Maurice Butterly and known as the City and Suburban Racecourse, or Jones&#x27; Road sports ground. From 1893 it was also used by the Bohemian Football Club. In 1891 &quot;Butterly&#x27;s field&quot; hosted Athletics meetings organised by the GAA.

==History==
Recognising the potential of the Jones&#x27; Road sports ground, a journalist and GAA member, Frank Dineen, borrowed much of the £3,250 asking price and bought the ground in 1908. In 1913 the GAA came into exclusive ownership of the plot when they purchased it from Dineen for £3,500. The ground was then renamed Croke Park in honour of Archbishop Thomas Croke, one of the GAA&#x27;s first patrons.

In 1913, Croke Park only had one stand on what is now known as the Hogan Stand side and grassy banks all round. In 1917, a grassy hill was constructed on the railway end of Croke Park to afford patrons a better view of the pitch. This terrace was known originally as Hill 60, after a battle in the Gallipoli Campaign, in which The Royal Dublin Fusiliers, Munster Fusiliers and Connaught Rangers fought. It was later renamed Hill 16 in memory of the 1916 Easter Rising. It is erroneously said to have been built from the ruins of the GPO but was constructed the previous year in 1915.

In 1918, the GAA set out to create a high-capacity stadium at Croke Park. Following the Hogan Stand, the Cusack Stand, named after Michael Cusack from Clare (who founded the GAA and served as its first secretary), was built in 1927. 1936 saw the first double-deck Cusack Stand open with 5,000 seats, and concrete terracing being constructed on Hill 16. In 1952 the Nally Stand was built in memorial of Pat Nally, another of the GAA founders. Seven years later, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the GAA, the first cantilevered &quot;New Hogan Stand&quot; was opened.

The highest attendance ever recorded at an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was 90,556 for Offaly v Down in 1961. Since the introduction of seating to the Cusack Stand in 1966, the largest crowd recorded has been 84,516.

===Bloody Sunday===
On 21 November 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, Croke Park was the scene of a massacre perpetrated by the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). The RIC entered the ground and began shooting into the crowd, killing or fatally wounding 14 civilians during a Dublin-Tipperary Gaelic football match. The dead included 13 spectators and Tipperary player Michael Hogan. Posthumously, the Hogan Stand, built in 1924, was named in his honour. Those shootings, on the day which became known as Bloody Sunday, were a reprisal for the killing of 15 people associated with the Cairo Gang, a group of British intelligence officers, by Michael Collins&#x27; &quot;Squad&quot; earlier that day.

===Dublin Rodeo===
In 1924, American rodeo promoter, Tex Austin, staged the Dublin Rodeo, Ireland&#x27;s first professional rodeo at Croke Park Stadium. For seven days, with two shows each day from August 18 to August 24, sell-out crowds saw cowboys and cowgirls from Canada, the United States, Mexico, Argentina and Australia compete for rodeo championship titles. Canadian bronc riders such as Andy Lund and his brother Art Lund, trick riders such as Ted Elder and Vera McGinnis were among the contestants. British Pathe filmed some of the rodeo events.

==Stadium redesign==
In 1984 the organisation decided to investigate ways to increase the capacity of the old stadium. The design for an 80,000-capacity stadium was completed in 1991. Gaelic sports have special requirements as they take place on a large field. A specific requirement was to ensure the spectators were not too far from the field of play. This resulted in the three-tier design from which viewing games is possible: the main concourse, a premium level incorporating hospitality facilities and an upper concourse. The premium level contains restaurants, bars and conference areas. The project was split into four phases over a 14-year period. Such was the importance of Croke Park to the GAA for hosting big games, that the stadium did not close during redevelopment. During each phase, different parts of the ground were redeveloped, while leaving the rest of the stadium open. Big games, including the annual All-Ireland Hurling and Football finals, were played in the stadium throughout the development.
===Phase one – New Cusack Stand===

The first phase of construction was to build a replacement for Croke Park&#x27;s Cusack Stand. A lower deck opened for use in 1994. The upper deck opened in 1995. Completed at a cost of £35 million, the new stand is 180 metres long, 35 metres high, has a capacity for 27,000 people and contains 46 hospitality suites. The new Cusack Stand contains three tiers from which viewing games is possible: the main concourse, a premium level incorporating hospitality facilities and finally an upper concourse. One end of the pitch was closer to the stand after this phase, as the process of slightly re-aligning the pitch during the redevelopment of the stadium began. The works were carried out by Sisk Group.

===Phase two – Davin Stand===
Phase Two of the development started in late 1998 and involved extending the new Cusack Stand to replace the existing Canal End terrace. It involved reacquiring a rugby pitch that had been sold to Belvedere College in 1910 by Frank Dineen. In payment and part exchange, the college was given the nearby Distillery Road sports grounds.
It is now known as The Davin Stand (Irish: &quot;Ardán Dáimhím&quot;), after Maurice Davin, the first president of the GAA. This phase also saw the creation of a tunnel which was later named the Ali tunnel in honour of Muhammad Ali and his fight against Al Lewis in July 1972 in Croke Park.

===Phase three – Hogan Stand===
Phase Three saw the building of the new Hogan Stand. This required a greater variety of spectator categories to be accommodated including general spectators, corporate patrons, VIPs, broadcast and media services and operation staff. Extras included a fitted-out mezzanine level for VIP and Ard Comhairle (Where the dignitaries sit) along with a top-level press media facility. The end of Phase Three took the total spectator capacity of Croke Park to 82,000.

The 1999 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was the last to be held with the old Hogan Stand in place.

===Phase four – Nally Stand &amp; Nally End/Dineen Hill 16 terrace===
After the 2003 Special Olympics, construction began in September 2003 on the final phase, Phase Four. This involved the redevelopment of the Nally Stand, named after the athlete Pat Nally, and Hill 16 into a new Nally End/Dineen Hill 16 terrace. While the name Nally had been used for the stand it replaced, the use of the name Dineen was new, and was in honour of Frank Dineen, who bought the original stadium for the GAA in 1908, giving it to them in 1913. The old Nally Stand was taken away and reassembled in Pairc Colmcille, home of Carrickmore GAA in County Tyrone.

The phase four development was officially opened by the then GAA President Seán Kelly on 14 March 2005. For logistical reasons (and, to a degree, historical reasons), and also to provide cheaper high-capacity space, the area is a terrace rather than a seated stand, the only remaining standing room in Croke Park. Unlike the previous Hill, the new terrace was divided into separate sections – Hill A (Cusack Stand side), Hill B (behind the goals) and the Nally terrace (on the site of the old Nally Stand). The fully redeveloped Hill has a capacity of around 13,200, bringing the overall capacity of the stadium to 82,300. This made the stadium the second biggest in Europe at the time after the Camp Nou, Barcelona. The presence of terracing meant that for the brief period when Croke Park hosted international association football during 2007–2009, the capacity was reduced to approximately 73,500, due to FIFA&#x27;s statutes stating that competitive games must be played in all-seater stadiums.

==Pitch==

The pitch in Croke Park is a soil pitch that replaced the Desso GrassMaster pitch laid in 2002. This replacement was made after several complaints by players and managers that the pitch was excessively hard and far too slippery.

Since January 2006, a special growth and lighting system called the SGL Concept has been used to assist grass growing conditions, even in the winter months. The system, created by Dutch company SGL (Stadium Grow Lighting), helps in controlling and managing all pitch growth factors, such as light, temperature, CO2, water, air and nutrients.

===Floodlighting===

With the 2007 Six Nations clash with France and possibly other matches in subsequent years requiring lighting the GAA installed floodlights in the stadium (after planning permission was granted). Indeed, many other GAA grounds around the country have started to erect floodlights as the organisation starts to hold games in the evenings, whereas traditionally major matches were played almost exclusively on Sunday afternoons. The first game to be played under these lights at Croke Park was a National Football League Division One match between Dublin and Tyrone on 3 February 2007 with Tyrone winning in front of a capacity crowd of over 81,000 – which remains a record attendance for a National League game, with Ireland&#x27;s Six Nations match with France following on 11 February. Temporary floodlights were installed for the American Bowl game between Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Steelers on the pitch in 1997, and again for the 2003 Special Olympics.

==Concerts==


==Non-Gaelic games==

There was great debate in Ireland regarding the use of Croke Park for sports other than those of the GAA. As the GAA was founded as a nationalist organisation to maintain and promote indigenous Irish sport, it has felt honour-bound throughout its history to oppose other, foreign (in practice, British), sports. In turn, nationalist groups supported the GAA as the prime example of purely Irish sporting culture.

Until its abolition in 1971, rule 27 of the GAA constitution stated that a member of the GAA could be banned from playing its games if found to be also playing association football, rugby or cricket. That rule was abolished but rule 42 still prohibited the use of GAA property for games with interests in conflict with the interests of the GAA. The belief was that rugby and association football were in competition with Gaelic football and hurling, and that if the GAA allowed these sports to use their ground it might be harmful to Gaelic games, while other sports, not seen as direct competitors with Gaelic football and hurling, were permitted, such as the two games of American football, the Croke Park Classic college football game between the University of Central Florida and Penn State and an American Bowl NFL preseason game between the Chicago Bears and the Pittsburgh Steelers, on the Croke Park pitch during the 1990s.

In June 2003, Croke Park served as the main venue for the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games with a noted highlight of the Special Olympics being Muhammad Ali attending the opening ceremony. They were the first edition of the Special Olympics World Summer Games not to be held in the United States.

On 16 April 2005, a motion to temporarily relax rule No. 42 was passed at the GAA Annual Congress. The motion gives the GAA Central Council the power to authorise the renting or leasing of Croke Park for events other than those controlled by the Association, during a period when Lansdowne Road – the venue for international football and rugby matches – was closed for redevelopment. The final result was 227 in favour of the motion to 97 against, 11 votes more than the required two-thirds majority.

In January 2006, it was announced that the GAA had reached an agreement with the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) to stage two Six Nations games and four football internationals at Croke Park in 2007 and in February 2007, use of the pitch by the FAI and the IRFU in 2008 was also agreed. These agreements were within the temporary relaxation terms, as Lansdowne Road was still under redevelopment until 2010. Although the GAA had said that hosted use of Croke Park would not extend beyond 2008, irrespective of the redevelopment progress, fixtures for the 2009 Six Nations rugby tournament saw the Irish rugby team using Croke park for a third season. 11 February 2007 saw the first rugby union international to be played there. Ireland were leading France in a Six Nations clash, but lost 17–20 after conceding a last minute (converted) try. Raphaël Ibañez scored the first try in that match; Ronan O&#x27;Gara scored Ireland&#x27;s first-ever try at Croke Park.

A second match between Ireland and England on 24 February 2007 was politically symbolic because of the events of Bloody Sunday in 1920. There was considerable concern as to what reaction there would be to the singing of the British national anthem &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. Ultimately the anthem was sung without interruption or incident, and applauded by both sets of supporters at the match, which Ireland won by 43–13 (their largest-ever win over England in rugby).

On 2 March 2010, Ireland played their final international rugby match against a Scotland team that was playing to avoid the wooden spoon and hadn&#x27;t won a championship match against Ireland since 2001. Outside half, Dan Parks inspired the Scots to a 3-point victory and ended Irish Hopes of a triple crown.

On 24 March 2007, the first association football match took place at Croke Park. The Republic of Ireland took on Wales in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group D, with a Stephen Ireland goal securing a 1–0 victory for the Irish in front of a crowd of 72,500. Prior to this, the IFA Cup had been played at the then Jones&#x27; Road in 1901, but this was 12 years before the GAA took ownership.

Negotiations took place for the NFL International Series&#x27;s 2011 game to be held at Croke Park but the game was awarded to Wembley Stadium. In July 2013, it was announced that Penn State would open their 2014 college football season against Central Florida at Croke Park. Croke Park will hold its first regular season NFL game in 2025 with the Pittsburgh Steelers being designated the home team. 

Croke Park was included as one of the stadiums in the Euro 2028 bid shortlist by England, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, it wasn&#x27;t included in the final list.

===World record attendance===
On 2 May 2009, Croke Park was the venue for a Heineken Cup rugby semi-final, in which Leinster defeated Munster 25–6. The attendance of 82,208 set a new world record attendance for a club rugby union game. This record stood until 31 March 2012 when it was surpassed by an English Premiership game between Harlequins and Saracens at Wembley Stadium which hosted a crowd of 83,761. This was beaten again in 2016 in the Top 14 final at the Nou Camp which hosted a crowd of 99,124

==Skyline tour==
A walkway, known under a sponsorship deal as Kellogg&#x27;s Skyline Tour Croke Park, opened on 1 June 2012. From 44 metres above the ground, it offers views of Dublin city and the surrounding area. The Olympic Torch was brought to the stadium and along the walkway on 6 June 2012.

==GAA Hall of Fame==

On 11 February 2013, the GAA opened the Hall of Fame section in the Croke Park Museum. The foundation of the award scheme is the Teams of the Millennium the football team which was announced in 1999 and the hurling team in 2000 and all 30 players were inducted into the hall of fame along with Limerick hurler Éamonn Cregan and Offaly footballer Tony McTague who were chosen by a GAA sub-committee from the years 1970–74.
New inductees will be chosen on an annual basis from the succeeding five-year intervals as well as from the years preceding 1970.
In April 2014, Kerry legend Mick O&#x27;Dwyer, Sligo footballer Micheál Kerins, along with hurlers Noel Skehan of Kilkenny and Pat McGrath of Waterford became the second group of former players to receive Hall of Fame awards.

==National Handball Centre==

The new National Handball Centre, located at the southeast corner of the stadium on Sackville Avenue, is close to completion, with the final minor stages of building delayed slightly due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The new centre contains three 4-Wall handball courts – including a three-sided glass wall show court with amphitheatre style seating for a capacity of 500 spectators, a Softball show court with seating capacity for 200 spectators and three 1-Wall courts as well as offices for GAA Handball staff, a bar and cafe as well as a community centre. The centre was used by Ireland&#x27;s national health service, the Health Service Executive for COVID-19 testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the centre&#x27;s official opening was delayed due to both the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the final completion of remaining building works, the centre had a &#x27;soft&#x27; opening in December 2021, allowing registered players to book the courts through Croke Park. The first competitive One-wall handball match took place in the centre in December 2022 during the European 1-Wall Tour &quot;EliteStop&quot; held in the Centre on Saturday and Sunday, 10–11 December 2022. The first competitive Four-wall handball matches to be played in the new Centre took place on Sunday, 2 April 2023 from 10am with the GAA Handball O&#x27;Neills-sponsored All-Ireland 4-Wall Senior Doubles semi-finals taking place in both Men&#x27;s and Ladies codes.

<text>Hildegard Carola Puwak (16 September 1949–25 May 2018) was a Romanian politician, a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), who served as the Minister for European Integration from 2000 until October 2003 (as part of the Adrian Năstase cabinet). Puwak was of German ethnicity (Swabian) and represented Timiș County in the Chamber of Deputies from 1996 to 2004.

==Education and career==
Puwak was born on 16 September 1949, in Reșița. She graduated in 1971 from the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies (ASE), Faculty of Commerce, magna cum laudae, and in 1979 got a doctorate in economics from the same university. Between 1971 and 1992 she was a visiting professor at ASE, and also a research fellow at the National Institute of Economy and Life Standard Research in Bucharest. In 1992 she worked as a visiting professor at &quot;a series of universities in the United States (Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Chicago) and Germany (Darmstadt)&quot;. Between 1993 and 1996 she was a Secretary of State in the Romanian government, working in the Department for Economic Reform. In 1996 she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, and acted as Deputy chairman to the Commission for European Integration, and was also a member of the Commission for Economical Policy, Reform and Privatization.

==Corruption scandal==
On 29 July 2003 a corruption scandal broke out when Adevărul newspaper accused Puwak of facilitating access for her husband&#x27;s and her son&#x27;s companies to some 150,000 non-reimbursable Euros through the &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; European Union program, while she was in charge of those funds. Puwak denied the accusations, stating the applications had been submitted while she was an opposition MP. The opposition parties of that time, PD and PNL, demanded her resignation or dismissal. On 2 September, Puwak demanded that the anti-corruption prosecutors (PNA) investigate the charges, and on the same day Prime Minister Adrian Năstase declared that the cabinet had full confidence in Puwak. On 4 September, a team from the European Commission&#x27;s Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) arrived to investigate. OLAF spokesman Alessandro Buttice announced on 11 September that his office was opening a case meant to assist the Romanian authorities in investigating allegations against Puwak. On 13 October, PSD&#x27;s Permanent Delegation (party leadership) decided to continue political support for her and Health Minister Mircea Beuran, awaiting the conclusion of the EU audit. Nevertheless, on 20 October, she resigned together with Beuran and , the Secretary General of the Năstase government. The same day Năstase presented his proposal for replacements to president Ion Iliescu, leading to media speculation that the three were fired instead. Năstase commented that &quot;They resigned to eliminate suspicions and the risk that the government will be forced to explain minor issues instead of taking care of important matters,&quot; referring to Romania&#x27;s bid to join the EU.

On 30 October, the Greater Romania Party, supported by PD and PNL, tried to initiate a parliamentary inquiry commission on the scandal, but this effort was defeated by the majority of the Romanian Senate. On 19 December 2003 the anti-corruption investigation was closed by prosecutor Adrian Miclescu without filing any charges. The case was then reopened on 26 August 2005, after the new Justice Minister Monica Macovei fired him. Eventually the case went to trial, and Puwak&#x27;s husband, Iosif Mihai Puwak, was sentenced in December 2007 to a 30-month suspended sentence for embezzling 39,000 euros from the EU da Vinci funds. He was also ordered to reimburse the money. He appealed, but the appeal was rejected by the Bucharest Court of Appeals on 4 June 2009. On 9 November 2009 her son Mihai Puwak was sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence for embezzling 32,160 euros from the same EU da Vinci funds, and ordered to reimburse the money. This sentence was final.

<doc id="322721" wikidata="Q593258" url="?curid=322721" title="Freedom of religion in Iran">
<text>The constitution of Iran states that the country is an Islamic republic; it specifies Twelver Ja’afari Shia Islam as the official state religion. 

In 2023, the country was scored zero out of 4 for religious freedom.

In the same year, it was ranked as the 8th most difficult place in the world to be a Christian.

==Background==

Freedom of religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance in the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) is marked by Iranian culture, major religion and politics. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran mandates that the official religion of Iran is Shia Islam and the Twelver Ja&#x27;fari school, and also mandates that other Islamic schools are to be accorded full respect, and their followers are free to act in accordance with their own jurisprudence in performing their religious rites. The Constitution of Iran stipulates that Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians are the only recognized religious minorities. The continuous presence of the country&#x27;s pre-Islamic, non-Muslim communities, such as Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, had accustomed the population to the participation of non-Muslims in society.

However, despite official recognition of such minorities by the IRI government, the actions of the government create a &quot;threatening atmosphere for some religious minorities&quot;. Groups reportedly &quot;targeted and prosecuted&quot; by the IRI include Baháʼís, Sufis, Muslim-born converts to another religion (usually Christianity), and Muslims who &quot;challenge the prevailing interpretation of Islam&quot;.
In 2020, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (ICRC) annual statement described the Islamic Republic as a country of particular concern under international law on religious freedom, and US Secretary of State included the Islamic Republic among the most egregious violators of religious freedom.

==Religious demography==

With a population of approximately 87 million, approximately 99.4% of Iran is Muslim (as of 2022). Of these an estimated 90-95% were Shi&#x27;a and 5-10% Sunni (mostly Turkomen, Arabs, Baluchs, and Kurds living in the southwest, southeast, and northwest); although there are no official statistics of the size of the Sufi Muslim population, some reports estimated several million people, while Baháʼís, Christians, Zoroastrians, Mandaeans, and Jews combined constitute approximately one percent of the population. 

An independent survey in 2020 showed that Iranians defined themselves as follows; 32% as Shia, 5% Sunni Muslim and 3% Sufi Muslim, as well as 9% atheists, 8% Zoroastrians, 7% spiritual and 1.5% Christian.

==Status of religious freedom==
The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran states that &quot;the investigation of individuals&#x27; beliefs is forbidden&quot; and that &quot;no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief.&quot; Five seats in the parliament are reserved for the minority religions; two seats for Armenian Christians, one for Assyrian Christians, one for Jews, and one for Zoroastrians. Iran’s Penal Code has no provisions criminalizing apostasy, as of January 18, 2012.

However, the adherents of religions not specifically protected under the Constitution do not enjoy freedom of activity, nor do Muslims who convert to another religion. Constitutional protections of freedom of belief are tempered by the fact that the death penalty has been imposed on the basis of vague charges, such as “‘attempts against the security of the state,’ ‘outrage against high-ranking officials,’ and ‘insults against the memory of Imam Khomeini and against the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic,’” and has been imposed on the basis of crimes like &quot;drug smuggling&quot; that religious (and political) dissidents have no plausible connection with.
While there is no specific law against apostasy, courts can hand down the death penalty for apostasy to ex-Muslims, and have done so in previous years, based on their interpretation of Sharia’a law and fatwas (legal opinions or decrees issued by Islamic religious leaders). There are laws against blasphemy and the punishment is death.
Sufis have been sentenced to prison terms for among other charges “establishing and membership in a deviant group.” Ex-Muslim atheists have been harassed. But limits on freedom of religion in the IRI most directly affects adherents of the Baháʼí Faith. The Government regards the Baháʼí community, whose faith originally arose from a movement within Islam, as a misguided or wayward &quot;sect.&quot;

In 2004, the Expediency Council approved appending a note to Article 297 of the 1991 Islamic Punishments Act, authorizing collection of equal &quot;blood money&quot; (&quot;diyeh&quot;) for the death of Muslims and non-Muslims. All women and Baháʼí men were excluded from the equalization provisions of the bill. According to law, Baháʼí blood or anyone&#x27; who marries or helps a Baháʼí or gets involved with them is considered &quot;mobah&quot;, meaning it can be spilled with impunity.

The Government fuels anti-Baháʼí sentiment in the country. Government officials have stated that the Baháʼís are not a religious minority, but a political organization which was associated with the Shah&#x27;s regime, is against the Iranian Revolution and engages in espionage activities. Nonetheless, government officials have reportedly stated that as individuals, all Baháʼís are entitled to their beliefs and are protected under other articles of the Constitution as citizens. In response to repeated attempts (between 1982 and 1984) by the Iranian representative to the United Nations to convince the United Nations diplomatic community that the Baháʼí Faith is a politicized organization with a record of criminal activism against the Iranian government, the United Nations has stated that there has been no evidence of Iran&#x27;s claims and that the Baháʼí community in Iran professes its allegiance to the state. The United Nations pointed to the Baháʼí teaching of obedience to the government of one&#x27;s country and stated that any involvement in any subversive acts against the government would be antithetical to precepts of the Baháʼí religion. The United Nations also stated that if the Iranian government did acknowledge that the Baháʼí Faith is a religion, it would be an admission that freedom of religion does not apply to all in Iran and that it is not abiding by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenants on Human Rights to which it is a signatory.

Unlike the Baháʼí Faith, Judaism is a recognized religion in Iran. Despite Iran&#x27;s official distrust of the country of Israel, the government does not directly attack Judaism itself.

The central feature of the country&#x27;s Islamic republican system is rule by a &quot;religious jurisconsult.&quot; The Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic controls the most important levers of power; he is chosen by a group of 86 religious scholars. All acts of the Majles (legislative body) must be reviewed for conformity with Islamic law and principles by the Council of Guardians, which is composed of six clerics appointed by the Supreme Leader and six Muslim jurists (legal scholars) nominated by the Head of the Judiciary and elected by parliament.

Religious activity is monitored closely by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance and by the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Adherents of recognized religious minorities are not required to register individually with the Government; however, their community, religious, and cultural events and organizations, including schools, are monitored closely. Registration of Baháʼís is a police function. Evangelical Christian groups have been pressured by government authorities to compile and submit membership lists for their congregations, but evangelicals have resisted this demand. In the early 2000s, non-Muslim owners of grocery shops were required to indicate their religious affiliation on the fronts of their shops.

==Restrictions on religious freedom==
=== Politics ===
By law and practice, religious minorities can be elected to a representative body or to hold senior government or military positions, and have 5 of a total 270 seats in the majlis reserved for religious minorities. Three of these seats are reserved for members of the Christian faith, including two seats for the country&#x27;s Armenian Christians, and one for Assyrians. There is also one seat for a member of the Jewish faith, and one for a member of the Zoroastrian faith. While members of the Sunni Muslim minority do not have reserved seats in the majlis, they are allowed to serve in the body. Sunni members tend to come from the larger Sunni communities. Members of religious minorities are allowed to vote. All of the minority religious groups, including Sunni, are barred from being elected president.

=== Employment ===
Members of religious minorities, are supported in their pursuit of serving in the judiciary and security services. All applicants for public sector employment are screened, irrespective of their faith, for their adherence to and knowledge of Islam, and members of religious minorities can serve in lower ranks of government employment. The constitution states that the country&#x27;s army must be administered by individuals who are committed to the objectives of the Iranian constitution, regardless of faith. No religious minorities are exempt from military service. Members of religious minorities with a college education could serve as an officer during their mandatory military service but could not be a career military officer.

=== Education ===
University applicants are required to pass an examination in Islamic theology, which limits the access of most religious minorities to higher education, although all public school students, including non-Muslims, must study Shia Islam. Applicants for public sector employment similarly are screened for their knowledge of Islam.

The Ministry of Education sets the religious curricula of public schools. All schools must teach a course on Shia Islamic teachings and all pupils must pass this course to progress to the next stage of study. Applicants to university must pass an exam on Islamic, Christian, or Jewish theology, based on their official religious affiliation.

=== Ministry of Education ===

The condition imposed began from 1981 and were reiterated in the fall of 1983 - the Ministry of Education and Training ordered that religious education must be done in Persian, a text written by the MET must be taught in all registered religious minority schools, schools must seek special permission for any ceremonies, and in keeping with society-wide restrictions, female teachers and students must observe Islamic dress code including Hijab when necessary (this last was re-inforced in 1985.) Even most of the time and occasions, all female citizens, including non-Muslims, are required to wear Hijab as Iran is currently an Islamic republic. There have been other requirements of citizens as well. In 1984 the government began to request religious affiliation on questionnaires for passports. Events held for religious groups were broken into and if the meetings were mixed sexed and or women were not wearing headscarves, arrests were made and meetings canceled. It was prohibited that Muslims attend these meetings of minority groups - some groups restricted events so only their own religious members could attend. There were restrictions on music at events. Many of these restrictions moderated in time or were applied to or affected one religion more vs others (see below) and the government has occasionally also taken steps to bring attention to issues important to a religion - in 1982 the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs printed a stamp commemorating the birth of Jesus.

The textbook the MET wrote on the minority religions was called Talimat-e Maxhadi Vizheh-ye Aqaliathaye Mazhabi - (Kalimi, Zarthoshti, Masihi); Religious Studies Specifically for Religious Minorities: (Jews, Zoroastrians, Christians.) The course was taught by Muslim teachers at least 3 hrs/wk. All the religious minorities objected to the text in 1982 claiming the book was a violation of Article 13 guaranteeing freedom in religious teaching, that there were overt and covert passages from the Quran, and lack of any qualifications of the anonymous author(s) rather than members of the religious minorities writing about their own religions. The situation moderated for Armenians significantly by 1995-6. There was also compromise of sorts allowed both Hebrew and Persian language use in Jewish schools.

In the early 2000s, recognized religious minorities were allowed by the Government to establish community centers and certain cultural, social, sports, or charitable associations that they finance themselves; this did not apply to the Baháʼí community, which since 1983 has been denied the right to assemble officially or to maintain administrative institutions. 

=== Marriage ===
In the early 2000s Muslim men were free to marry non-Muslim women; a non-Muslim woman automatically became Muslim when the marriage took place. However, marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men were not recognized unless the man showed proof that he has converted to Islam. If the child of a non-Muslim family converted to Islam, he or she inherited all the wealth of the family.

=== Religious conversion and proselytizing ===

The Government does not ensure the right of citizens to change or renounce their religious faith. Apostasy, specifically conversion from Islam, can be punishable by death. In 2022, the penal code specified the death penalty for proselytizing and any attempt by non-Muslims to convert Muslims. 

=== Imprisonment ===
A summary of 2013 incidents of prison sentences, fines and punishments showed &quot;79 religious minorities were sentenced to a total of 3620 months in prison, 200 months probation, 75 lashings and 41,030,000,000 rials in fines. In this area, 49% of the cases involved Baháʼí minorities, 16% Christian and Dervish and 14% Sunni minority. Arrests of religious minorities increased by 36% in relation to last year.&quot;

In 2022, the UN Special Rapporteur expressed concern about the number of executions of members of minority communities, noting that members of the Baluch and Kurdish minorities accounted for 35% of executions in the first half of the year; the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran reported 576 executions in 2022, compared to 317 executions in 2021 and 248 in 2020. In the same year, the Human Rights Activists News Agency reported 140 arrests, 51 travel bans, 94 house raids and 11 court cases based on citizens&#x27; religious beliefs. 

=== Dress code ===
On 7 March 1979, less than a month after the Iranian Revolution, the Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini decreed the hijab (Islamic headscarf) to be mandatory for all women in workplaces. He further decreed that women would no longer be allowed to enter any government office without the hijab, as they would be &quot;naked&quot; without it.

Since then, violence and harassment against women not wearing the hijab in accordance with Iranian government standards, whether by law enforcement personnel or pro-government vigilantes, has been reported, From 1980, women could not enter government or public buildings or attend their workplaces without a hijab. In 1983, mandatory hijab in public was introduced in the penal code, stating that &quot;women who appear in public without religious hijab will be sentenced to whipping up to 74 lashes&quot;. In practice, however, a number of women, such as Saba Kord Afshari and Yasaman Aryani, were sentenced only to heavy prison terms.

In the 2010s and 2020s, clothing in Iranian society underwent significant changes, and young women in particular became more liberal about hijab rules. This has prompted the Guidance Patrol, Iran&#x27;s Islamic religious police, to launch intermittent campaigns to verbally admonish or violently arrest and &quot;re-educate&quot; women they considered to be wearing the hijab incorrectly. Under routine circumstances, the detainees are brought to a center where they are re-instructed in the dress regulations, before being made to sign a pledge to uphold said regulations, and then being allowed to leave with their family.

Protests against the compulsory hijab have been common since 1979 revolution. One of the largest protests took place between 8 and 14 March 1979, beginning on International Women&#x27;s Day, a day after hijab rules were introduced by the Islamic Republic. Protests against mandatory hijab rules continued, such as during the 2019–2020 protests, when protesters attacked a Guidance Patrol van and freed two detained women.

In 2020, two representatives of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei separately said that improperly veiled women should be made to feel &quot;unsafe&quot;. The representatives later backtracked and said that their comments were misunderstood. Among the general population, an independent survey conducted in the same year showed that 58% of Iranians did not believe in hijab altogether, and 72% were against compulsory hijab rules. Only 15% insisted on the legal obligation to wear it in public.

November 2022 saw the death of Mahsa Amini at the hands of morality police, after she was detained for allegedly wearing her hijab in an incorrect way. By the end of the month, protests throughout the country had led to the deaths of at least 448 people and an estimated 18,170 arrests.

===Baháʼís===

The Baháʼí Faith originated in Iran during the 1860s. The Baháʼís believe their prophet to be the Messiah for this era. Initially it attracted a wide following among Shi&#x27;a clergy. The political and religious authorities of that time joined to suppress the movement, and since then the hostility of the Shi&#x27;a clergy to the Baháʼí Faith has remained strong. Baháʼís are considered apostates by the Shi&#x27;a clergy because of their claim to a valid religious revelation subsequent to that of Mohammed. The Baháʼí Faith is defined by the Government as a political &quot;sect,&quot; historically linked to the Pahlavi regime and, hence, counterrevolutionary, even though one of the tenets of the Baháʼí Faith is non-involvement in partisan politics.

Baháʼís may not teach or practice their faith or maintain links with coreligionists abroad. The fact that the Baháʼí world headquarters (established by the founder of the Baháʼí Faith in the 19th century, in what was then Ottoman-controlled Palestine) is situated in what is now the state of Israel, allows the Iranian government to charge the Baháʼís with &quot;espionage on behalf of Zionism,&quot; in particular when caught communicating with or sending monetary contributions to the Baháʼí headquarters.

Broad restrictions on Baháʼís appear to be aimed at destroying them as a community. Baháʼís repeatedly have been offered relief from mistreatment in exchange for recanting their faith. Baháʼí cemeteries, holy places, historical sites, administrative centers, and other assets were seized shortly after the 1979 revolution. None of the properties have been returned, and many have been destroyed.

Baháʼís are not allowed to bury and honor their dead in keeping with their religious tradition. They are permitted access only to areas of wasteland that the Government designates for their use, and are not allowed to mark the graves. Many historic Baháʼí gravesites have been desecrated or destroyed.

In what appeared to be a hopeful development, in 2002 the Government offered the Tehran community a piece of land for use as a cemetery. However, the land was in the desert, with no access to water, making it impossible to perform Baháʼí mourning rituals. In addition the Government stipulated that no markers be put on individual graves and that no mortuary facilities be built on the site, making it impossible to perform a proper burial.

Baháʼí group meetings and religious education, which often take place in private homes and offices, are curtailed severely. Public and private universities continue to deny admittance to Baháʼí students, a particularly demoralizing blow to a community that traditionally has placed a high value on education. Denial of access to higher education appears aimed at the eventual impoverishment of the Baháʼí community. The Baháʼí Institute for Higher Education was founded in 1987 and continues to operate despite government persecution.

Baháʼís regularly are denied compensation for injury or criminal victimization. Government authorities claim that only Muslim plaintiffs are eligible for compensation in these circumstances.

In 1993, the UNSR reported the existence of a government policy directive regarding the Baháʼís. According to the directive, the Supreme Revolutionary Council instructed government agencies to block the progress and development of the Baháʼí community, expel Baháʼí students from universities, cut Baháʼí links with groups outside the country, restrict employment of Baháʼís, and deny Baháʼís &quot;positions of influence,&quot; including in education. The Government claims that the directive is a forgery. However, it appears to be an accurate reflection of current government practice designed to eradicate slowly the Baháʼí community.

In September 2001, the Ministry of Justice issued a report that reiterated that government policy continued to aim at the eventual elimination of the Baháʼís as a community. It stated in part that Baháʼís would only be permitted to enroll in schools if they did not identify themselves as Baháʼís, and that Baháʼís preferably should be enrolled in schools that have a strong and imposing religious ideology. The report also stated that Baháʼís must be expelled from universities, either in the admission process or during the course of their studies, once it becomes known that they are Baháʼís.

While in recent years the Government has eased some restrictions, thereby enabling Baháʼís to obtain food-ration booklets and send their children to public elementary and secondary schools, the prohibition against the admission of Baháʼís to universities remains. Thousands of Baháʼís dismissed from government jobs in the early 1980s receive no unemployment benefits and have been required to repay the Government for salaries or pensions received from the first day of employment. Those unable to do so face prison sentences.

Iran has taken some positive steps in recognizing the rights of Baháʼís, as well as other religious minorities. In November 1999, President Khatami publicly stated that no one in the country should be persecuted because of their religious beliefs. He added that he would defend the civil rights of all citizens, regardless of their beliefs or religion. Subsequently, the Expediency Council approved the &quot;Right of Citizenship&quot; bill, affirming the social and political rights of all citizens and their equality before the law. In February 2000, following approval of the bill, the head of the judiciary issued a circular letter to all registry offices throughout the country that provided for any couple to be registered as husband and wife without being required to state their religious affiliation. The measure effectively permits the registration of Baháʼí marriages in the country. Previously Baháʼí marriages were not recognized by the Government, leaving Baháʼí women open to charges of prostitution. Thus children of Baháʼí marriages were not recognized as legitimate and therefore denied inheritance rights.

According to a U.S. panel, attacks on Baháʼís in Iran have increased since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president as well as Sunni Muslims. On May 14, 2008, members of an informal body known as the Friends that oversaw the needs of the Baháʼí community in Iran were arrested and taken to Evin prison. Officers from the Ministry of Intelligence in Tehran searched and raided the homes of the six people in the early hours of May 14. The arrest of the six follow the detention of another Baháʼí leader in March, who was originally taken to answer questions relating to the burial of a Baháʼí in the Baháʼí cemetery in Mashad. They have not been charged, and are prisoners of conscience. The Iran Human Rights Documentation Center has stated that they are concerned for the safety of the Baháʼís, and that the recent events are similar to the disappearance of 25 Baháʼí leaders in the early 1980s. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has stated that it fears that the &quot;development signals a return to the darkest days of repression in Iran in the 1980s when Baha&#x27;is were routinely arrested, imprisoned, and executed.&quot;

Geneva, June 10, 2020, The Baháʼí International Community (BIC) issued a statement on the situation of Baháʼís in Iran, expressing concern over the &quot;unprecedented number of new prison sentences, re-incarceration and a media campaign of hatred, are raising concerns of the long-persecuted religious minority in the country.,&quot; &quot;re-incarceration,&quot; and &quot;media disgusting campaign&quot; against Baháʼís in Iran. According to the statement, the Iranian authorities have ramped up their persecution of the Baháʼís, targeting at least 71 individuals across the country in recent weeks. Reports of new threats to “uproot” the community in Shiraz.
===Jews===

While Jews are a recognized religious minority, allegations of official discrimination are frequent. The Government&#x27;s anti-Israel policies, along with a perception among radical Muslim elements that all Jewish citizens support Zionism and the State of Israel, create a threatening atmosphere for the small Jewish community. In the past, Jewish leaders reportedly were reluctant to draw attention to official mistreatment of their community due to fear of government reprisal.

Persecution and discrimination has increased among the government and society since the Revolution in 1979. On the eve of Passover 1998, 13 Iranian Jewish men were arrested on charges of espionage. The United States and Israel both demanded their release. Iran accused the men of spying for &quot;world arrogance&quot; (being the U.S.) and the &quot;Zionist regime&quot; (being Israel). The conviction is highly doubted by the rest of the world.

Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se) reviewed school textbooks in 2022 and noted that Jewish history in Iran is avoided and the Holocaust is ignored; there is also much antisemitic rhetoric, anti-Israeli propaganda, and anecdotes which present the Jews as partners to Sunni Muslims, without any counterbalancing material.

The head of the Anti-Defamation Union says that the tomb of &quot;Esther and Mordecai&quot;, the burial place of Xerxes&#x27; Jewish wife, which is considered a Jewish religious site, has been set on fire in Hamedan.

===Mandaeans===
According to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees Background Paper on Iran, the Mandaeans are regarded as Christians, and are included among the country&#x27;s three recognized religious minorities. However, Mandaeans regard themselves not as Christians, but as adherents of a religion that predates Christianity in both belief and practice. Mandaeans enjoyed official support as a distinct religion prior to the revolution, but their legal status as a religion has been the subject of debate in the Majles and by 2002 it was not yet clarified. It is almost impossible for declared Mandaeans to work or study at university and many have left the country since 2000.

==Abuses of religious freedom==

It was noted in 2014 that individuals who have been &quot;targeted and prosecuted&quot; by the Iranian state&quot; for religious crimes of apostasy and blasphemy/&quot;Swearing at the Prophet&quot;, were &quot;diverse&quot; and included &quot;Muslim-born converts to Christianity, Bahá&#x27;ís, Muslims who challenge the prevailing interpretation of Islam, and others who espouse unconventional religious beliefs&quot;; some cases had &quot;clear political overtones&quot;, while others &quot;seem to be primarily of a religious nature&quot;.

On October 27, 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement on World Religious Freedom Day, including Iran as one of the three of the world&#x27;s most egregious violators of religious freedom—the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Iran and North Korea—and that these countries &quot;have tightened their coercive measures to silence their own people&quot;.

===Baháʼís===

Information in 2022 suggests that there were 300,000 Baháʼís in Iran.

According to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of the United States, between 1979 and 2005, more than 200 Baháʼís were killed and 15 disappeared and are presumed dead.

Manuchehr Khulusi was arrested in June 1999 while visiting fellow Baháʼís in the town of Birjand, and was imprisoned until his release in May 2000. During his imprisonment, Khulusi was interrogated, beaten, held in solitary confinement, and denied access to his lawyer. The charges brought against him remain unknown, but they were believed to be related to his faith. The Islamic Revolutionary Court in Mashhad held a 2-day trial in September 1999 and sentenced Khulusi to death in February 2000. He was released the following year.

The Government appears to engage in harassment of the Baháʼí community by arresting Baháʼís arbitrarily, charging them, and then releasing them, often without dropping the charges against them. Those with charges still pending against them fear arrest at any time. In 2022, Baháʼís in the USA stated that there were over 1,000 Baháʼís in Iranian prisons.

The property rights of Baháʼís generally are disregarded. In the early 2000s, it was noted that the Government&#x27;s seizure of Baháʼí personal property, as well as its denial of Baháʼí access to education and employment, are eroding the economic base of the Baháʼí community. In 2020, a court ruled that Baháʼí was “a perverse ideology” and therefore they had no “legitimacy in their ownership” of any property; Baháʼís argued that their property rights are enshrined in a 1984 fatwa issued by then Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.

In 1998, after a nationwide raid of more than 500 Baháʼí homes and offices, as well as numerous arrests, the authorities closed the Baháʼí Institute of Higher Learning. Also known as the &quot;Open University,&quot; the Institute was established by the Baháʼí community shortly after the revolution to offer higher educational opportunities to Baháʼí students who had been denied access to the country&#x27;s high schools and universities. This was one of several closures between 1987 and 2005, with more arrests in 2011 and 2014.

A confidential letter sent on October 29, 2005 by the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forced in Iran stated that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei instructed the Command Headquarters to identify people who adhered to the Baháʼí Faith and monitor their activities; In a press release, the UN Special Rapporteur states that she &quot;is highly concerned by information she has received concerning the treatment of members of the Baháʼí community in Iran.&quot; She further states that &quot;The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.&quot;

Shahnaz Sabet, a Baháʼí citizen living in Shiraz, was arrested on Monday, October 12, 2020, and transferred to Adelabad Prison in Shiraz to serve his sentence.

===Christians===


Blasphemy law in Iran is used as a weapon against Christians and Christianity within Iran&#x27;s borders.

Government-sanctioned translations of the Bible are reported to be available in Iran; however unsanctioned copies have been confiscated by the government. 

In 2010 Youcef Nadarkhani, a Jammiat-e Rabbani (Christian) pastor, was given a death sentence for apostasy; he was acquitted of apostasy, sparing him the death penalty, but found guilty of proselytizing and released as he had already served his time. In 2017, he was arrested on charges of “acting against national security” and promoting “Zionist Christianity,” and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment; both his sons were denied educational advancement. He was released in February 2023, but faced new charges in July 2023.

In 1976, the Christian population numbered 168,593 people, mostly Armenians. Due to the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, almost half of the Armenians migrated to the newly independent Armenia. However, the opposite trend has occurred since 2000, and the number of Christians with Iranian citizenship increased to 109,415 in 2006 and 117,704 in 2011. According to the national statistical centre, Christians were fastest growing religion in Iran during 1996-2006 period (+38.9%), and second fastest during 2006-2011 period (+7.6%, after Zoroastrianism). At the same time, significant immigration of Assyrians from Iraq has been recorded due to massacres and harassment in post-Saddam Iraq. However, most of those Assyrians in Iran do not have Iranian citizenship. In 2008, the central office of the International Union of Assyrians, a mistranslation in the Iranian press for the Assyrian Universal Alliance, was officially transferred to Iran after being hosted in the United States for more than four decades.

====Education of Armenian Christians====

Some issues dealing with Christianity in Iran deal more directly with the Armenian ethnic minorities. For example, in early 1983 the MET specifically requested that the Armenian religious schools teach religion in Persian and time allocated to the Armenian languages must be reduced or eliminated. While the community responded to these orders issues raised in discussions included if the Armenians could speak/teach their own language other minorities would demand the same but also if Persian was used it would make proselytization easier as facility with Persian language use of religious issues improved. At the end of the 1983 academic year the MET requested the questions that were to be included in the final exam and the questions had to be sent in Persian and were ordered to be used in Persian as the final exam. Most fifth grade students refused to take the test and 3rd grade students handed in blank pages. The authorities then failed all the students. Some schools ignored the demands on languages, others did limit teaching to 2 hrs and others removed it entirely. Some continued religious classes and some dropped them all together. Observance of these rules on Armenian language teaching was most strict in Tehran while 6 to 8 hrs per week were common beyond. However, in 1995 the limit on languages was raised from 2 hrs to 5 hrs per week in Tehran as well. Circa 1996 a settlement was reached; during the first two months of each school year, the ministry-provided Persian book on religious ethics is taught in Armenian schools while Armenian-approved religious lessons are taught in Armenian for the rest of the year. This was not a totally satisfactory settlement of the issue for both sides, but it settled the issue.

In 2002, Armenian Christians reported that they were permitted to teach their practices to Armenian students as an elective at some schools. Assyrian Christians were also permitted to use their own religious textbooks in their schools, as long as the government authorized their content.

===Jews===
In 1984 the government began to request religious affiliation on questionnaires for passports. In contrast to other registered religious minorities starting in 1983, Jewish families were prevented from traveling as a group and if one member of the family traveled then another family member&#x27;s passport was held. Regardless, thousands of Jews had emigrated in the first eight months of 1987 through Austria. Perhaps half the Jews left Iran leaving about 30,000 Jews by 1986. Some may have returned in the late 1980s. Generally the overall economic position has deteriorated significantly post revolution.

It is estimated that a minimum of 13 Jews have been executed by Iran since the country&#x27;s revolution. Of them include two men (not of the ones written above) hanged in 1997 for allegedly spying for Israel and the United States; as well as businessman Ruhollah Kadkhodah-Zadeh who was hanged in prison without a public charge or legal proceeding, apparently for assisting Jews to emigrate.

===Shia===
The Special Clerical Court (SCC) system, established in 1987 to investigate offenses and crimes committed by clerics and which the Supreme Leader oversees directly, is not provided for in the constitution and operates outside the domain of the judiciary. In 2006 critics alleged that the clerical courts were used to prosecute certain clerics for expressing controversial ideas and for participating in activities outside the area of religion, including journalism.

During the latter part of 2000, a Special Clerical Court began the trial of Hojatoleslam Hassan Yousefi Eshkevari, a cleric who participated in a conference in Berlin on Iran, on charges of apostasy, &quot;corruption on earth,&quot; &quot;declaring war on God,&quot; and &quot;denial of basic religious principles,&quot; which potentially carry the death penalty. Eshkevari has called for more liberal interpretations of Islamic law in certain areas. The verdict was not announced, but, according to Amnesty International, Eshkevari widely was reported to have been sentenced to death. In November 2001, following domestic and international criticism, his sentence reportedly was reduced to 30 months&#x27; imprisonment and removal of his status as a cleric. He served four years in prison and was released on 6 February 2005. During the crackdown on protestors of the 2009 presidential elections, he fled to Germany to seek political asylum.

Independent newspapers and magazines have been closed, and leading publishers and journalists imprisoned, with 25 journalists detained in the first 8 months of 2023.

In 2002 academic Hashem Aghajari was sentenced to death for blasphemy against Muhammed, based on a speech in which he challenged Muslims not to blindly follow the clergy. After domestic Iranian and international outcry, his sentence was reduced to five years in prison. He was released from prison in July 2004 after paying a bail of $122,500.
In 2014, he is sentenced to one year in prison on a charge of &quot;propaganda against the regime&quot;.

In November 2018, a prison warden at Qarchak women&#x27;s prison in Varamin, attacked and bit three Dervish religious minority prisoners who were demanding their confiscated belongings back.

===Zoroastrians===

Zoroastrian served as the national- or state religion of a significant portion of the Iranian people for many centuries before it was gradually marginalized by Islam from the 7th century onwards. The political power of the pre-Islamic Iranian dynasties lent Zoroastrians immense prestige in ancient times, and some of its leading doctrines were adopted by other religious systems.

There are no official reports of government harassment of the Zoroastrian community to date. Unofficial reports of discrimination in employment and education has come up, but are by no means frequent. Zoroastrians are free to make their annual pilgrimage to one of the holiest sites of their faith, the temple of Chak-Chak (near the city of Yazd).

==Societal attitudes==
The continuous activity of the country&#x27;s pre-Islamic, non-Muslim communities, such as Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians, has accustomed the population to the presence of non-Muslims in society. However, actions of the conservative parts of society and the government create a threatening atmosphere for some religious minorities. For a Christian, Jew or Zoroastrian there is constant pressure at school to convert.

The Jewish community has been reduced to less than one-half of its prerevolutionary size. Some of this emigration is connected with the larger, general waves of departures following the establishment of the Islamic Republic, but some also stems from continued perceived anti-Semitism on the part of the government and within society.

In 2022, officials continued to use antisemitic rhetoric in official statements and permitted its use in publications and media. It was reported that the government-affiliated Fars News Agency accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of “Zionist behavior”; it was also reported that the Jewish Studies Center had published more than 1,000 antisemitic articles, reports, commentaries, books, and videos across 6 years.

It was reported that ISIS were active in the country in 2022, in particular, attacking the Shia Shah Cheragh Shrine in Shiraz and killing 15 people.

<text>Port Alberni () is a city located on Vancouver Island in the province of British Columbia, Canada. The city lies within the Alberni Valley at the head of the Alberni Inlet, Vancouver Island&#x27;s longest inlet. Port Alberni currently has a total population of 18,259.

It is the location of the head offices of the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District. Port Alberni is served by the coast-spanning Island Highway system, and a local airport. The principal industry is forestry products.

==History==

Port Alberni and the West Coast of Vancouver Island have been populated by the people of Tseshaht First Nation, Hupacasath First Nation, and the Nuu-chah-nulth people for thousands of years. Many place names in Port Alberni have a Nuu-chah-nulth origin, such as Somass (washing), Kitsuksis (log across mouth of creek), Pacheena (foamy), and Nootka (go around). Ancient petroglyph carvings can be found at Sproat Lake.

The City of Port Alberni is named for Captain Don Pedro de Alberní, a Spanish officer, who commanded Fort San Miguel at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island&#x27;s west coast from 1790 to 1792. Sproat Lake was named after Gilbert Sproat and Stamp Falls and Stamp River were named after Edward Stamp. Rogers Creek, which flows through the centre of Port Alberni, is named after Jeremiah Rogers who was the head logger for the British company Anderson, Anderson &amp; Co.

In March 1787, Captain Charles William Barkley of the &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot;, explored Barkley Sound, which now bears his name. Barkley travelled with his 17-year-old bride, Frances Barkley, the first European woman to visit what is now British Columbia. &quot;Frances Barkley&quot; is also the name of one of the two vessels that makes trips down the Alberni Inlet from Port Alberni to Bamfield and Ucluelet. The other, since retired, was the MV &quot;Lady Rose&quot;.

In 1849, the British established the Colony of Vancouver Island under Governor James Douglas. The island had been claimed by both Spain and Great Britain, but a treaty was made between them designating the island as British territory. The island colony was later merged with the Colony of British Columbia, which joined Canada in 1871.

In 1856, Adam Horne, a Scottish fur trader employed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, was directed to locate a land route across Vancouver Island. There were stories that the Indigenous people used a trail starting at Qualicum. Adam Horne found this trail leading to the Alberni Valley and it became known as the Horne Lake Trail. Many other settlers used this trail to get to the Alberni Valley.

In 1860, the Anderson company, a shipping company from London, England, took the advice of their Victoria agent Captain Edward Stamp and set up a sawmill operation. At the time, the American Civil War prevented the importation of timber from the southern United States. Gilbert Sproat and Edward Stamp transported men and machinery to Alberni. They received land grants from Governor James Douglas and started running the Anderson sawmill at the mouth of the Somass River on May 22, 1861, at the rate of 14,000 board feet a day. The first mill in B.C. was built to export lumber. The original mill failed, but several others were established in the 1880s. The settlement of Alberni developed around the sawmill.

In 1862, small-scale placer gold mining took place on China Creek; in the 1890s more gold mining took place along the Alberni Inlet at China Creek and Mineral Creek. Several gold veins were found. Exploration for gold continued over the years with peaks in the 1930s and 1960s.

In 1896, a new settlement was established to the south of Alberni, first known as New Alberni and later as Port Alberni. It was built around a new Canadian Pacific Navigation Company wharf at the foot of today&#x27;s Argyle Street.

From 1900 until 1973, the Alberni Indian Residential School operated just north of Port Alberni on the west bank of the Somass River. The Alberni School is now considered to be part of a genocidal operation against the Indigenous people. The School, run by the Presbyterian and United Churches and the federal government, forcibly separated children from their families and communities so as to cut them off from their traditional culture. Children at the school were fed poorly, at one time deliberately as part of a malnutrition experiment, murdered, and abused in other ways. The residential school was closed in 1973 and in 2009 it was demolished. &quot;Strength from Within&quot; is an art installation by Connie Watts located in Port Alberni that commemorates survivors of and those whose people died at the Alberni School. The installation depicts two thunderbirds, adorned with West Coast designs, and a third without any cultural symbols to represent the horrors of the residential school era.

Port Alberni Mill opened as a kraft pulp mill in 1946, followed by two paper machines in 1957.

The 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake was a 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck at 10:15 a.m. on Sunday, June 23, 1946. The main shock epicentre occurred in the Forbidden Plateau area north of Port Alberni. While most of the large earthquakes in the Vancouver area occur at tectonic plate boundaries, the 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake was a crustal event. Shaking was felt from Portland, Oregon to Prince Rupert, British Columbia. The earthquake is remembered as one of the most damaging earthquakes in the history of British Columbia.

In 1955, the Alberni Athletics Senior-A Men&#x27;s Basketball Team had an outstanding year. The Alberni Athletics won the Canadian Senior Basketball Championships at home. A young Jim Robson honed his sports reporting skills doing the play-by-play on radio station CJAV. The Alberni Athletics were inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.

In 1964, Port Alberni was hit by a tsunami during the Good Friday earthquake. The water rose about in a minute reaching above the high-water mark. About 375 homes were damaged and 55 were washed away, however there were no injuries or fatalities.

In 1967, the neighboring towns of Alberni (on the north) and Port Alberni (on the south) amalgamated to form the city of Port Alberni.

Today, the town is a hub for local, regional, and provincial government, and its West Coast General Hospital provides services to west coast communities like Bamfield, Tofino, and Ucluelet. Currently, the natural resources of the area are taking centre stage again, but in a different way. Port Alberni is in the process of &quot;re-developing&quot; itself as a tourism destination. The area&#x27;s amenities, such as the natural environment of the area, the opportunities for fishing (both marine and freshwater), its convenience as a jumping-off point for new outdoor recreation and ecotourism activities such as hiking, kayaking, and mountain-biking, lend themselves to these activities very well.

==Geography==

Located at the head of the Alberni Inlet, Port Alberni lies adjacent to this natural harbour as well as the Somass River. The other end of the inlet is located on Barkley Sound, which includes the Broken Group Islands, considered to be one of the best areas for kayaking in the world. Sproat Lake is located west of the city, and the valley is guarded by the snow-covered peaks of the Beaufort range, Mount Arrowsmith and Mount Klitsa, and surrounded by mountains on all sides. Kuth-kah-chulth, is the Nuu-Chah-Nulth name for Mount Arrowsmith.

The city itself owes its unique layout to its former &quot;twin city&quot; status, due to its two official city centres, as well as the numerous creeks and ravines that bisect the townsite. The former city of Alberni is now dubbed &quot;North Port&quot;, and is centred at Highway 4 and Gertrude Street. Visitors continuing onward to the west coast will pass this intersection, marked by the historic Alberni Post Office on the Southeast corner. Much of Port Alberni&#x27;s recent development has occurred in the North Port area, especially &quot;up the hill&quot;, east of the North Port downtown.

The former City of Port Alberni (now referred to as &quot;South Port&quot; or &quot;Uptown&quot;) can be found about South on 3rd and Argyle street. In 2004, the Capitol Theatre, a local landmark in South Port, underwent extensive renovations and emerged as a stately yet modern relic of past times. This theatre now often hosts live performances. South Port is anchored by the Harbour Quay, a waterfront collection of shops, art galleries, great food and parks. The Port Alberni railway station, farmers market on Saturdays, as well as the Maritime Discovery Centre can be found here.

The city&#x27;s West End is an eclectic mix of new suburban style homes, large acreages, and two First Nations reserves. Much of the residential growth over the past decade has occurred in the city&#x27;s West End, where the Westporte neighbourhood has taken shape.

The creeks and ravines that cut through the city create natural barriers; Kitsuksis Creek, Cherry Creek, Roger Creek and Dry Creek each flow through the city. The hiking trails in these creeks and ravines add tremendously to the quality of life in Port Alberni.

===Climate===
Port Alberni&#x27;s dry July gives it a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;), although it is much wetter than most such places. Although the summer months do see a relatively small amount of precipitation, the vast majority of it comes during the winter months as cool, moist air flows from the Pacific Ocean over the much colder B.C. coast. Despite its location on the relatively drier east side of Vancouver Island, the resulting weak rain shadow is not enough to keep the city dry. Despite its generally wet climate, in summer, afternoon shade temperatures quite often exceed on average 15–30 days a year, making it one of the warmest places on Vancouver Island in the summer months.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Port Alberni was on 28 June 2021. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 14 January 1950.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Port Alberni had a population of 18,259 living in 8,451 of its 8,919 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 17,678. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The median total household income in 2020 for Port Alberni was $67,000. 

One major characteristic known is the twin city demographic, where previously there were the distinct Port Alberni and Alberni municipalities, the remnants remain with two distinct city centres.

=== Ethnicity ===
=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Port Alberni included:
*Irreligion (11,365 persons or 63.3%)
*Christianity (5,785 persons or 32.2%)
*Sikhism (215 persons or 1.2%)
*Hinduism (125 persons or 0.7%)
*Buddhism (110 persons or 0.6%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (85 persons or 0.5%)
*Islam (70 persons or 0.4%)

==Health and education==
Public education is offered by School District 70 Alberni, which operates 11 schools in Port Alberni. A new multimillion-dollar state of the art high school opened in 2012–2013.

The &quot;Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique&quot; operates one Francophone primary school: &quot;école des Grands-cèdres&quot;. It also provides a French-English school.

Health services are provided in town by Westcoast General Hospital, operated by the Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA).

==Economy==

The chief source of industry in Port Alberni is forestry, commercial fishing, and tourism. In the 1950s, 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s the forestry labour force in Port Alberni was one of the highest paid in the country. However, over the last fifteen years there has been a decline in the forestry industry and a consequent relative decline in the economy of the city and of its residents. The Alberni Valley&#x27;s forests consist primarily of Douglas fir, hemlock, yellow cedar and western red cedar. Most of the old growth forests have been logged with current logging coming from second growth forests. Port Alberni Mill, owned by Catalyst Paper, sits on the edge of the Alberni Inlet. It produces 340,000 tonnes of directory paper and lightweight coated paper each year. There is also a lumber mill, Alberni Pacific Division, that also sits on the inlet. Several smaller sawmills exist throughout the valley. Farming is also practised in the valley.

Port Alberni also serves as a hub for those travelling to the West Coast of Vancouver Island, including Ucluelet, Tofino and Pacific Rim National Park. As commodities tend to be much pricier in these remote areas, campers and travellers often do their shopping in Port Alberni before continuing their journey. This has resulted in development along the Johnston Road (Highway 4) corridor, including several big box retailers, grocery stores and strip mall developments. Previously, eco-tourism companies have set up shop in the Alberni Valley, taking advantage of the city&#x27;s location on the fringe of wilderness yet proximate location to Vancouver and Victoria. For example, there&#x27;s a kayaking, ATV touring, a windsurfing and a glider company.

==Salmon==
A team of salmon enhancement volunteers and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans have worked to improve salmon habitats throughout the Alberni Valley, adding a Coho hatchery at the McLean Mill National Historic Site, in addition to the successful Robertson Creek Hatchery on the Stamp River. Port Alberni was awarded the World Fishing Network&#x27;s “Ultimate Fishing Town” designation in 2010.

==Attractions==

Port Alberni sits beneath Mount Arrowsmith and is almost completely surrounded by mountains. These mountains provide hiking, walking, and mountain biking trails. It also provides an opportunity to view wildlife, including deer and black bears.

The city is also known for its fishing. Its waters contain five different species of salmon and yearly runs of steelhead. Halibut can also be found in the saltwater inlets near the city.

The state-of-the-art Robertson Creek Fish Hatchery is the most successful hatchery on Vancouver Island, producing chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead smolts. It is located a short drive west of Port Alberni. and is open to the public.

Port Alberni is home to the McLean Mill National Historic Site which incorporates a steam railway from the downtown harbour to the saw mill up the valley. The historic mill offers demonstrations, including operating the old mill. The Alberni Valley has a museum and many ancillary attractions, including Sproat Lake, which is located just outside Port Alberni.

The world&#x27;s largest aerial firefighting flying boats, the Martin Mars Water Bombers, once made their home on nearby Sproat Lake. This lake is also a summer destination for local residents and cottagers from surrounding areas. The sole remaining Water Bomber is now owned by The Coulson Group, and has been renamed from the Martin Mars Water Bombers to the Coulson Flying Tankers. The provincial lake also provided petroglyphs carved First Nations many years ago.

Besides the offers from nature, the city has two quays, Harbour Quay and Victoria Quay, which have shops, restaurants, and art galleries along the inlet. On some autumn evenings, when the inlet&#x27;s tide is low, black bears can be spotted looking for fish on the other side of Victoria Quay.

The Alberni Valley Multiplex in Port Alberni is home to the Alberni Valley Bulldogs, a Junior-A hockey team in the BCHL.

Della Falls, the 16th tallest waterfall in Canada (), is accessible by boat from Great Central Lake or by helicopter. Helicopters are not allowed to land in Strathcona Provincial Park.

==Hiking trails around Port Alberni==

The main highway to Port Alberni is Highway 4, known locally as the Alberni Highway and the Pacific Rim Highway. It is the longest east–west main vehicle route on Vancouver Island, with a total length of . The highway to Port Alberni was completed in 1942, and has been designated as Highway 4 since 1953. The highway starts at Qualicum Beach, then reaches Port Alberni from which it continues on to Tofino and Ucluelet.

Port Alberni is served by the Island Rail Corridor branch line from Parksville known as the Port Alberni Subdivision.

===Port operations===
The Port of Port Alberni regularly receives large oceangoing cargo vessels, such as the Hong Kong-based OYSTER BAY and the Bergen-based STAR LINDESNES, as well as tugs, fishing boats, and search and rescue vessels.

The Port Alberni Port Authority was created in 1999. Under the Canada Marine Act, the Port Alberni Port Authority is responsible for the Alberni Inlet from the Somass River to Tzartus Island.

<text>Pygopodidae, commonly known as snake-lizards, or flap-footed lizards, are a family of legless lizards with reduced or absent limbs, and are a type of gecko. The 47 species are placed in two subfamilies and eight genera. They have unusually long, slender bodies, giving them a strong resemblance to snakes. Like snakes and most geckos, they have no eyelids, but unlike snakes, they have external ear holes and flat, unforked tongues. They are native to Australia and New Guinea.

Pygopodids have no fore limbs at all, but they do possess vestigial hind limbs in the form of small, flattened flaps. These may have some role in courtship and defensive behaviour, and may even aid in locomotion through vegetation. Some species are insectivorous burrowing animals, but others are adapted to moving through dense spinifex or other vegetation.

==Shared gecko characteristics==
The pygopodids and other geckos share a number of characteristics:
* the production of parchment-shelled eggs in clutch sizes of two
* the ability to lick clean the clear spectacles that cover their lidless eyes; 
* vocalization sounds like the common gecko &quot;harsh squeak&quot;.
* skull anatomy
* inner ears anatomy
* communal nests. Some nests have been found to have as many as 30 eggs.

==Differences from snakes==
Legless lizards are often killed due to their similar appearance to snakes. A number of external characteristics can be used to distinguish legless lizards (including the hooded scaly-foot) from snakes:
* Flap-footed lizards have vestigial hind limbs.
* Legless lizards have broad, fleshy tongues, dissimilar from the forked tongues of snakes.
* Most legless lizards have external ears.
* Ventral scales are in a paired series.
* Unbroken tails in legless lizards are much longer than the body, whereas snake bodies are longer than their tails.
* Can vocalise, snakes can not.

==Hearing==
Pygopodids can hear tones higher than any other reptiles. Individuals in the species &quot;Delma pax&quot; can respond to a 60-decibel sound with a frequency of 11,100 Hz, more than an octave above the highest note on a standard piano.

==Taxonomy==

Pygopodidae is one of several taxonomic families of geckos, and is most closely related to two other Australian gecko families Carphodactylidae and Diplodactylidae.

<text>Dibamidae or blind skinks is a family of lizards characterized by their elongated cylindrical body and an apparent lack of limbs. Female dibamids are entirely limbless and the males retain small flap-like hind limbs, which they use to grip their partner during mating. They have a rigidly fused skull, lack pterygoid teeth and external ears. Their eyes are greatly reduced, and covered with a scale.

They are small insectivorous lizards, with long, slender bodies, adapted for burrowing into the soil. They usually lay one egg with a hard, calcified shell, rather than the leathery shells typical of many other reptile groups.

The family Dibamidae has two genera, &quot;Dibamus&quot; with 23 species native to Southeast Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and western New Guinea and the monotypic &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; native to Mexico. Recent phylogenetic analyses place the dibamids as the sister clade to all the other lizards and snakes or classify them as sharing a common ancestor with the infraorder Gekkota, with Dibamidae and Gekkota forming the sister clade to all other squamates. &quot;Hoeckosaurus&quot; from the Oligocene of Mongolia represents the only fossil record of the group.

== Characteristics ==

=== General appearance ===
Dibamids are burrower lizards characterized by their elongated bodies with blunt head and tail, and an apparent lack of limbs. Relatively small, blind skinks can reach a maximum length of 250 mm (9.8 in) from head to tail and the snout vent length (SVL) is variable between both genus &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; and &quot;Dibamus.&quot; In &quot;Anelytropsis,&quot; the tail is longer than in &quot;Dibamus&quot; and represents between 34 and the 38% of the snout vent length which can range from 77 to 180 mm (3 to 7 in). In &quot;Dibamus&quot;, the tail corresponds to 9 to 25% of the SVL that varies from 52 to 203 mm (2 to 8 in).

Usually dibamids are dark colored, from brown to dark purple, with little to no variation along their body and frequently lack elaborate patterns. It is common to find a color gradation from the darker back towards a lighter ventral side. Scales are shiny and smooth and very similar and overlapping along with some variation in number and shape in the head and anal regions where males usually have additional scales to cover anal pores. Scale row counts varies between both genera; &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; has 19 to 25 rows whereas &quot;Dibamus&quot; has 18 to 33. In both groups osteoderms are absent.

General characteristics of the soft tissue includes a tongue that is covered in lamellae except in the tip, heavily modified ears without external openings or middle ear cavity or eustachian tubes, and highly reduced eyes that are covered by a scale and lack internal structure, particularly in &quot;Dibamus.&quot;

=== Limbs ===
Dibamids are lizards with highly reduced limbs but they are not completely limbless. Males and females have rudimentary poorly developed hind limbs containing a femur, tibia and fibula in males, and distal cartilage cap. These elements are more developed on &quot;Dibamus&quot; than in &quot;Anelytropsis&quot;. Female &quot;Dibamus&quot; lack the tibia and the fibula.

=== Skull ===
The skull is approximately 5 – 7 mm in length with reduced kinesis and a more rigid skull for burrowing. The combination of fossorial habits and small size, contributes to the development of a skull configuration that is frequently found in other groups of burrowers and miniaturized species. Among those characteristics are the closure of the supratemporal fenestra and the post-temporal fenestra, the relative large braincase, tubular or scroll-like palatines and modified jaw suspension mechanism with the quadrate articulating with the lateral wall of the braincase.

Other characteristics of the skull of blind skinks include the absence of a parietal foramen, a well developed secondary palate formed by three different bones, the maxillae, vomers and palatines which are expanded ventromedially to form a scroll, and the lack of palatal teeth. Nasal and frontal bones are paired and contact each other in a W-shape suture with no overlap between the two bones, and several bones are lost (lacrimal, postorbital and jugal) or highly reduced (supratemporal and squamosal). The main cranial differences, besides sizes, between &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; and &quot;Dibamus&quot; is the presence of epipterygoid and postfrontal in the Central American genus.

The mandible of Dibamidae bears less than 10 teeth and is composed of only three bones, the dentary, the coronoid and the compound bone. A remnant of the splenial bone is only present in one species of &quot;Dibamus&quot;, &quot;Dibamus novaeguineae&quot;.

== Classification ==
The family Dibamidae contains two genera, &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; and &quot;Dibamus&quot;, and the close relationship of the genera was based on two morphological characteristics that are unique to these groups, the secondary palate and the lamellae covering the tongue, and additional cranial characteristics that can be shared with other groups of lizards.

The anatomical characteristics that dibamids share with other squamates contributed to the formulation of different taxonomic hypothesis. Dibamids, and particularly &quot;Dibamus&quot; was considered to be part of geckos and precisely the family of legless geckos; snakes, considering the organization of the skull and jaw muscles; or was proposed to be closely related to a group of fossorial skinks with elongated bodies and reduced limbs.

== Phylogeny ==

=== Relationships among Dibamidae ===
The relationships within Dibamidae have only be assessed until recently in a phylogenetic analysis that included DNA sequences from seven nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene for 8 species, seven species of &quot;Dibamus&quot; and the one species of &quot;Anelytropsis&quot;. This analysis shows that there are two major clades within Dibamidae, one that includes the one species form the genus &quot;Anelytropsis&quot;, &quot;Analytropsis papillous&quot;, and the species of &quot;Dibamus&quot; that are distributed along continental Southeast Asia (&quot;Dibamus greeri, Dibamus montanus&quot;, and &quot;Dibamus bourreti&quot;). The other clade includes species that are currently distributed in the peninsular Southeast Asia and Islands (&quot;Dibamus tiomanensis, Dibamus novaeguineae, Dibamus seramensis&quot;, and &quot;Dibamus celebensis&quot;). These clades diverged 72 million years ago. &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; diverged from all mainland &quot;Dibamus&quot; at approximately 69.2 million years ago.

=== Dibamidae and its relationship with Squamata ===
The relationship of Dibamidae with other Squamata (lizards and snakes) has a long history of phylogenetic studies in which the morphological characteristics are used to determine those relationships. Those analyses found close relationships between Dibamidae and all other lizards with elongated bodies, limb reduction and usually, a fossorial habit like amphisbaenians, snakes or fossorial skinks. In morphology based phylogenies, dibamids are sister taxa to amphisbaenians and the clade that includes amphisbaenians and Dibamidae is sister to all snakes. The close relationships of this groups are the result of convergent evolution among these groups since some of the morphological traits have evolved independently in different groups.

More recent phylogenies using DNA sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial genes include a large taxonomic sample of squamates and place dibamids as the sister group to all other lizards and snakes, or with Gekkota as the sister group to all other squamates. Phylogenetic evidence supports dibamids being the most basal squamates, being sister to all other lizards and snakes, and indicates that they diverged during the late Triassic, around 210 million years ago.

==Biodiversity==
There are two recognized genera within the family, &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; and &quot;Dibamus&quot;. According to The Reptile Database, &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; is monotypic and &quot;Dibamus&quot; includes 23 species:

&quot;Anelytropsis&quot;

* &quot;Anelytropsis papillosus&quot;

&quot;Dibamus&quot;

* &quot;Dibamus alfredi&quot;
* &quot;Dibamus bogadeki&quot;

An extinct monotypic genus, &quot;Hoeckosaurus&quot; was recently proposed from the description of fossil material from the early Oligocene of the Valley of Lakes in Central Mongolia.

* Hoeckosaurus mongoliensis sp. nov.

== Biogeography ==
Dibamids have a disjunct distribution with one genus living in Northern Mexico, &quot;Anelytropsis&quot;, and the other one, &quot;Dibamus&quot;, living in South East Asia. Biogeographical studies suggest that the separation between &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; and &quot;Dibamus&quot;, specifically the clade with species that are distributed in continental South East Asia, occurred approximately 69 million years ago during the late Cretaceous and the migration from Asia to North America took place during the Late Paleocene or Eocene through Beringia.

== Biology ==
Blind skinks are insectivorous and feed on arthropods and earthworms. Blind skinks are characterized by their fossorial or burrowing habits. They can dig their own burrows, use old burrows or other openings in the ground, or dwell under the leaf litter or logs.

Species of the genus &quot;Dibamus&quot; are frequently found in primary and secondary forests in a wide range of altitudinal variation (from the sea level to approximately 1300 meters above sea level). &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; is found in drier environments and is adapted to xeric conditions of different environments in northern Mexico.

Little is known about the reproduction of this group of lizards, but the inspection of female specimens from herpetological collections indicate that dibamids lays single egg with hardened shell, and eggs are laid frequently, at least in &quot;Dibamus&quot;.

== Conservation ==
None of the species of Dibamidae are listed as endangered species in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) include some of the species of the genus &quot;Dibamus&quot; and the single species of &quot;Anelytropsis&quot; in the red list of endangered species, most are in the category of least concern, and two species, &quot;Dibamus kondaoensis&quot; and &quot;Dibamus tiomanensis&quot; are listed as nearly threatened and endangered respectively&quot;.&quot;

<text>Coquitlam ( ) is a city in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. Mainly suburban, Coquitlam is the sixth-largest city in the province, with an estimated population of 174,248 in 2024, and one of the 21 municipalities comprising Metro Vancouver. The mayor is Richard Stewart.

Simon Fraser explored the region in 1808, encountering the Indigenous Coast Salish peoples. Europeans started settling in the 1860s. Fraser Mills, a lumber mill on the north bank of the Fraser River was constructed in 1889, and by 1908 there were 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, office block, barber shop, pool hall, and a Sikh temple.

== History ==
The Coast Salish people were the first to live in this area, and archaeology confirms continuous occupation of the territory for at least 9,000 years. The name &quot;Kwikwetlem&quot; is said to be derived from a Coast Salish term &quot;kʷikʷəƛ̓əm&quot; meaning &quot;red fish up the river&quot;.

Explorer Simon Fraser came through the region in 1808, and in the 1860s Europeans gradually started settling the area. Coquitlam began as a &quot;place-in-between&quot; with the construction of North Road in the mid-19th century to provide Royal Engineers in New Westminster access to the year-round port facilities in Port Moody.

The young municipality got its first boost in 1889 when Frank Ross and James McLaren opened what would become Fraser Mills, a $350,000, then state-of-the-art lumber mill on the north bank of the Fraser River. The Corporation of the District of Coquitlam was incorporated in 1891. By 1908, a mill town of 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, office block, barber shop, pool hall and Sikh temple had grown around the mill. A mill manager&#x27;s residence was built that would later become Place des Arts.

Over the next two years, several contingents of French Canadian mill workers arrived from Quebec, and Maillardville was born. Named for Father Edmond Maillard, a young Oblate from France, it became the largest Francophone centre west of Manitoba. Maillardville&#x27;s past is recognized today in street names, the Francophone education system and French immersion programs, French-language Girl Guides and scouts, and celebrations such as &quot;Festival du Bois&quot;.

Following World War II, Coquitlam and the rest of the Lower Mainland experienced substantial population growth that continues today. The opening of Lougheed Highway in 1953 made the city more accessible and set the stage for residential growth. In 1971, Coquitlam and Fraser Mills were amalgamated, which gave the city a larger industrial base. The mill closed in 2001, and is now currently the subject of a proposed waterfront community.

== Geography ==
Coquitlam is situated some east of Vancouver, where the Coquitlam River connects with the Fraser River and extends northeast along the Pitt River toward the Coquitlam and Pitt lakes. Coquitlam borders Burnaby and Port Moody to the west, New Westminster to the southwest, and Port Coquitlam to the southeast. Burke Mountain, Eagle Ridge, and tall Coquitlam Mountain form the northern boundary of the city. Coquitlam&#x27;s area, , is about six times larger than either Port Moody or Port Coquitlam.

Coquitlam is in the Pacific Time Zone (winter UTC−8, summer UTC−7), and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.

=== Neighbourhoods ===

Coquitlam&#x27;s geographic shape can be thought of as a tilted hourglass, with two larger parcels of land with a smaller central section connecting them.

Southwest Coquitlam comprises the original core of the city, with Maillardville and Fraser River industrial sector giving way to the large, elevated, flat-plateaued residential areas of Austin Heights. These older residences, with larger property dimensions, are increasingly being torn down and replaced with newer and larger homes. The Poirier Street area was the city&#x27;s original recreational centre with the Coquitlam Sports Centre, Chimo Aquatic and Fitness Centre, and sports fields located there, while City Hall was previously located further south in Maillardville.

The Austin Heights area contains Como Lake, a renowned urban fishing and recreation area, and headwaters for the Como watershed. The watershed represents one of the last urban watersheds in the Tri-Cities that supports wild stocks of coho salmon as well as other species at risk such as coastal cutthroat trout (both sea-run and resident) and bird species such as the great blue heron and green heron. It also contains Mundy Park, one of the largest urban parks in the Metro Vancouver area.
In 1984, the provincial government sold formerly attached to Riverview Hospital to Molnar Developments. Shortly afterward, this land was subdivided and became Riverview Heights, with about 250 single-family homes. The remaining of this still-active mental health facility has been the subject of much controversy amongst developers, environmentalists, and conservationists. In 2005, the city&#x27;s task force on the hospital lands rejected the idea of further housing on the lands and declared that the lands and buildings should be protected and remain as a mental health facility. In May 2021, the Government of British Columbia announced that the Riverview lands had been renamed səmiq̓wəʔelə (pronounced suh-MEE-kwuh-EL-uh), meaning &quot;The Place of the Great Blue Heron&quot;. The kʷikʷəƛ̓əm Nation and BC Housing are working on a long-term master plan for development of the site.

Coquitlam Town Centre, was designated as a &quot;Regional Town Centre&quot; under the Metro Vancouver&#x27;s Livable Region Strategic Plan. The concept of a town centre for the area dates back to 1975, and is intended to have a high concentration of high-density housing, offices, cultural, entertainment and education facilities to serve major growth areas of the region, served by rapid transit service. It is in the town centre that many public buildings can be found, including City Hall, a branch of the Coquitlam Public Library, an R.C.M.P. station, Coquitlam&#x27;s main fire hall, the David Lam Campus of Douglas College, the Evergreen Cultural Centre, City Centre Aquatic Complex, Town Centre Park and Percy Perry Stadium.

In 1989, the provincial government sold of second-growth forested land on the south slope of Eagle Mountain, known locally as &quot;Eagle Ridge&quot;, to developer Wesbild. This resulted in the closure of Westwood Motorsport Park in 1990, and the creation of Westwood Plateau, which was developed into 4,525 upscale homes, as well as two golf courses.

With development on Westwood Plateau completed and the opening of the David Avenue Connector in 2006, Coquitlam&#x27;s primary urban development has now shifted to Burke Mountain in the northeastern portion of the city.

With new development of the Evergreen Extension of the Millennium Line of the SkyTrain rapid transit system which began operation in December 2016, Coquitlam&#x27;s urban development area has again shifted to Burquitlam and secondly Burke Mountain. The Burke Mountain area plan is now divided into 4 new neighbourhood plans: Lower Hyde Creek Neighbourhood, Upper Hyde Creek Neighbourhood, Partington Creek, and Smiling Creek.


=== Climate ===
Like much of Metro Vancouver, Coquitlam has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate type &quot;Cfb&quot;), experiencing mild temperatures and high precipitation; warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. However, compared to most other cities in the area, precipitation is especially heavy in Coquitlam due to its proximity to the mountain slopes. With westward air moving off the Pacific Ocean, the air is forced to flow up the Coast Mountains causing it to cool and condense and fall as precipitation, this process is known as orographic precipitation. The orographic effect is mainly responsible for the massive annual average precipitation that Coquitlam receives each year, with most falling as rainfall in the fall and winter months, with in November; the summer is usually sunny with minimal precipitation with in July. Although the mild temperatures allow for mostly rain to fall during the winter months, occasionally snow will fall. With a slightly higher elevation compared to the rest of Metro Vancouver, Coquitlam receives an average of of snow each year, with it rarely staying on the ground for a few days, adding to a very intermittent snow cover during the winter season.

Coquitlam is also located in one of the warmest regions in Canada where average mean annual temperature is . Temperatures are warm during the summer months with an average high of , and an average low of in August. During the winter months, the average high is , and the average low is in December. This relatively mild climate, by Canadian standards, is caused by the warm Alaska Current offshore and the many mountain ranges preventing the cold arctic air from the rest of Canada from reaching the southwest corner of British Columbia.

<text>The Lacertidae are the family of the wall lizards, true lizards, or sometimes simply lacertas, which are native to Afro-Eurasia. It is a diverse family with at about 360 species in 39 genera. They represent the dominant group of reptiles found in Europe.

==Habitat==
The European and Mediterranean species of lacertids live mainly in forest and scrub habitats. &quot;Eremias&quot; and &quot;Ophisops&quot; species replace these in the grassland and desert habitats of Asia. African species usually live in rocky, arid areas. &quot;Holaspis&quot; species are among the few arboreal lacertids, and its two species, &quot;Holaspis guentheri&quot; and &quot;Holaspis laevis&quot;, are gliders (although apparently poor ones), using their broad tail and flattened body as an aerofoil.

==Description==
Lacertids are small to medium-sized lizards. Most species are less than 9cm long, excluding the tail. The largest living species, &quot;Gallotia stehlini&quot;, reaches 46cm, and some extinct forms were larger still. They are primarily insectivorous. An exception is &quot;Meroles anchietae&quot;, one of the few wall lizards that regularly eat seeds – an appropriate food for a lizard of the harsh Namib Desert.

Lacertids are remarkably similar in form, with slender bodies and long tails, but have highly varied patterns and colours, even within the same species. Their scales are large on the head, which often also has osteoderms, small and granular on the back, and rectangular on the underside. Most species are sexually dimorphic, with the males and females having different patterns.

At least eight species from the Caucasus are parthenogenetic, and three species give birth to live young, including the viviparous lizard, &quot;Zootoca vivipara&quot;.

== Evolutionary history ==
Lacertids are suspected to have originated in Europe, due to their earliest fossils being found in the region, alongside those of their sister group, the extinct Eolacertidae. Fossils possibly attributable to lacertids are known from the Paleocene of France and Belgium. The oldest definitive lacertid is known from the early Eocene (Ypresian) in Mutigny, France in the Paris Basin. Lacertids dispersed into Asia by the early Oligocene. The timing of the colonisation of Africa is uncertain, ranging from the Eocene to the Miocene.

<doc id="322740" wikidata="Q229788" url="?curid=322740" title="Celtic cross">
<text>The Celtic cross is a form of Christian cross featuring a nimbus or ring that emerged in Ireland, France and Great Britain in the Early Middle Ages. A type of ringed cross, it became widespread through its use in the stone high crosses erected across the islands, especially in regions evangelised by Irish missionaries, from the ninth through the 12th centuries.

A staple of Insular art, the Celtic cross is essentially a Latin cross with a nimbus surrounding the intersection of the arms and stem. Scholars have debated its exact origins, but it is related to earlier crosses featuring rings. The form gained new popularity during the Celtic Revival of the 19th century; the name &quot;Celtic cross&quot; is a convention dating from that time. The shape, usually decorated with interlace and other motifs from Insular art, became popular for funerary monuments and other uses, and has remained so, spreading well beyond Ireland.
==Early history==

Ringed crosses similar to older Continental forms appeared in Ireland, England and Scotland in incised stone slab artwork and artifacts like the Ardagh chalice. However, the shape achieved its greatest popularity by its use in the monumental stone high crosses, a distinctive and widespread form of Insular art. These monuments, which first appeared in the ninth century, usually (though not always) take the form of a ringed cross on a stepped or pyramidal base. The form has obvious structural advantages, reducing the length of unsupported side arms. There are a number of theories as to its origin in Ireland and Britain. Some scholars consider the ring a holdover from earlier wooden crosses, which may have required struts to support the crossarm. Others have seen it as deriving from indigenous Bronze Age art featuring a wheel or disc around a head, or from early Coptic crosses based on the ankh. However, Michael W. Herren, Shirley Ann Brown, and others believe it originates in earlier ringed crosses in Christian art. Crosses with a ring representing the celestial sphere developed from the writings of the Church Fathers. The &quot;cosmological cross&quot; is an important motif in Coelius Sedulius&#x27;s poem &quot;Carmen Paschale&quot;, known in Ireland by the seventh century.

It is not clear where the first high crosses originated. The first examples date to about the ninth century and occur in two groups: at Ahenny in Ireland, and at Iona, an Irish monastery off the Scottish coast. The Ahenny group is generally earlier. However, it is possible that St. Johns Cross at Iona was the first high cross; Iona&#x27;s influence as a center of pilgrimage may have led this cross to inspire the Ahenny group as well as other ringed crosses in Pictish stones.

A variety of crosses bear inscriptions in ogham, an early medieval Irish alphabet. Standing crosses in Ireland and areas under Irish influence tend to be shorter and more massive than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents, which have mostly lost their headpieces. Irish examples with a head in cross form include the Cross of Kells, Ardboe High Cross, the crosses at Monasterboice, the Cross of the Scriptures, Clonmacnoise and those in Scotland at Iona and the Kildalton Cross, which may be the earliest to survive in good condition. Surviving, free-standing crosses are in Cornwall, including St Piran&#x27;s cross at Perranporth, and Wales. Other stone crosses are found in the former Northumbria and Scotland, and further south in England, where they merge with the similar Anglo-Saxon cross making tradition, in the Ruthwell Cross for example. Most examples in Britain were destroyed during the Protestant Reformation. By about A.D. 1200 the initial wave of cross building came to an end in Ireland.

Popular legend in Ireland says that the Christian cross was introduced by Saint Patrick or possibly Saint 
Declan, though there are no examples from this early period. It has often been claimed that Patrick combined the symbol of Christianity with the sun cross to give pagan followers an idea of the importance of the cross. By linking it with the idea of the life-giving properties of the sun, these two ideas were linked to appeal to pagans. Other interpretations claim that placing the cross on top of the circle represents Christ&#x27;s supremacy over the pagan sun.

== Modern times ==

===Celtic Revival===
The Celtic Revival of the mid-19th century led to an increased use and creation of Celtic crosses in Ireland. In 1853, casts of several historical high crosses were exhibited at the Dublin Industrial Exhibition. In 1857, Henry O&#x27;Neill published &quot;Illustrations of the Most Interesting of the Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland&quot;. These two events stimulated interest in the Celtic cross as a symbol for a renewed sense of heritage within Ireland.

New versions of the high cross were designed for fashionable cemetery monuments in Victorian Dublin in the 1860s. From Dublin, the revival spread to the rest of the country and beyond. Since the Celtic Revival, the ringed cross became an emblem of Celtic identity, in addition to its more traditional religious symbolism.

Modern interest in the symbol increased because of Alexander and Euphemia Ritchie. The two worked on the island of Iona in Scotland from 1899 to 1940 and popularised use of the Celtic cross in jewelry.
Since its revival in the 1850s, the Celtic cross has been used extensively as grave markers, straying from medieval usage, when the symbol was typically used for a public monument. The Celtic cross now appears in various retail items. Both the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Northern Ireland national football team have used versions of the Celtic cross in their logos and advertising. The Church in Wales since 1954 have used a flag with a Celtic cross in the centre.

===White supremacist symbolism===

A version of the Celtic cross is used as a symbol by white supremacists. It was used by Nazis in Norway in the 1930s and 1940s; more recently, it has been used by neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and other white supremacist groups. In general, white supremacists use a version of the symbol with a square cross as opposed to the traditional elongated cross. This symbol forms part of the logo of Stormfront.

It is suggested that adoption of the symbol in the context of right-wing politics is linked with the activity of Jesuit priest , a prominent figure of the interwar scout movement in France. In 1924, the victory of anti-clerical Cartel des Gauches in general elections caused the mobilisation of right-wing forces, with Doncœur playing a major role in formation of Fédération Nationale Catholique and . The same year, impressed by , a Catholic organisation within the German Youth Movement, he founded its local equivalent, Cadets. Doncœur, inspired by the G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ball and the Cross&quot;, decided that the symbol of the movement, &quot;croix cadet&quot;, should consist of a circle, representing the material world, supported by a square Christian cross intersecting it.

After the Fall of France, Vichy government relied on pre-existing organisations to implement its youth policy according to the principles of the National Revolution. The field was dominated by Catholic scout movements, the leaders of which were put in charge of Secretariat-General of Youth. In 1941, the symbol of Doncœur, now named &quot;croix celtique&quot;, was adopted as an emblem for Cadets of the Légion in Algeria, a youth movement within Légion Française des Combattants, a veteran organisation which the government hoped could be transformed to function as the single party of the state. Then it was used as insignia of Equipes nationales, a youth civilian service institution founded in 1942. After the war, Pierre Sidos appropriated the symbol as an emblem of the far-right movement Jeune Nation, founded by him in 1949.

White supremacist use of the long and short Celtic cross represents only a small minority of the symbol&#x27;s use. The symbol in both forms is used by non-extremists in contexts such as Christianity, neo-Paganism, and Irish patriotism. Furthermore, according to the American Anti-Defamation League, the cross itself does not denote white supremacy.

<doc id="322743" wikidata="Q3099264" url="?curid=322743" title="Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia">
<text>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an Islamic absolute monarchy in which Sunni Islam is the official state religion based on firm Sharia law. Non-Muslims must practice their religion in private and are vulnerable to discrimination and arrest. While no law requires all citizens to be Muslim, non-Muslim foreigners attempting to acquire Saudi Arabian nationality must convert to Islam. Children born to Muslim fathers are by law deemed Muslim. 

Religious freedom is not provided for under the law. The government does not provide legal recognition or protection for freedom of religion, and it is severely restricted in practice. As a matter of policy, the government guarantees and protects the right to private worship for all, including non-Muslims who gather in homes for religious practice; however, this right is not respected in practice and is not defined in law.

The Saudi Mutaween (), also known as the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) or &quot;religious police&quot; was enforcing the prohibition on the public practice of non-Muslim religions, though its powers were significantly curtailed in April 2016. Sharia applies to all people inside Saudi Arabia, regardless of religion.

==Religious demography==
The country&#x27;s total land area is about 2,150,000 sq kilometers and in 2022 the population was about 34 million, of whom approximately 19 million were citizens. Comprehensive statistics for the religious denominations of foreigners are not available, but estimated figures show approximately 31.5 Muslims from the various branches and schools of Islam, 2.1 million Christians (including Eastern Orthodox, Protestants, and Roman Catholics), 708,000 Hindus, 114,000 Buddhists, approximately 67,000 Sikhs, and 242,000 atheists.

Accurate religious demographics of citizens are difficult to obtain. A majority of Saudi citizens identify as Sunni Muslim. A minority of citizens are Shia Muslims. In 2006, they formed around 15% of the native population. They live mostly in the eastern districts on the Persian Gulf (Qatif, Al-Hasa, Dammam), where they constitute approximately three-quarters of the native population, and in the western highlands of Arabia (districts of Jazan, Najran, Asir, Medina, Ta&#x27;if, and Hijaz).

==Status of religious freedom==
Saudi Arabia is an Islamic theocracy and the government has declared the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah (tradition) of Muhammad to be the country&#x27;s Constitution. Freedom of religion is not illegal, but spreading the religion is illegal. Islam is the official religion. Under the law, children born to Muslim fathers are also Muslim, regardless of the country or the religious tradition in which they have been raised. The government prohibits the public practice of other religions but generally allows private practice of non-Muslim religions.
The primary source of law in Saudi Arabia is based on Sharia (Islamic law), with Shari&#x27;a courts basing their judgments largely on a code derived from the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah. Additionally, traditional tribal law and custom remain significant.

The only national holidays observed in Saudi Arabia are the two Eids, Eid Al-Fitr at the end of Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha at the conclusion of the Hajj and the Saudi national day. Contrary practices, such as celebrating Maulid Al-Nabi (birthday of Muhammad) and visits to the tombs of renowned Muslims, are forbidden, although enforcement was more relaxed in some communities than in others, and Shi&#x27;a were permitted to observe Ashura publicly in some communities.

==Restrictions on religious freedom==
Islamic practice generally is limited to that of a school of the Sunni branch of Islam as interpreted by Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, an 18th-century Arab religious scholar. Outside Saudi Arabia, this branch of Islam is often referred to as &quot;Wahhabi,&quot; a term the Saudis do not use.

Practices contrary to this interpretation, such as celebration of Muhammad&#x27;s birthday and visits to the tombs of renowned Muslims, are discouraged. The spreading of Muslim teachings not in conformity with the officially accepted interpretation of Islam is prohibited. Writers and other individuals who publicly criticize this interpretation, including both those who advocate a stricter interpretation and those who favor a more moderate interpretation than the government&#x27;s, have reportedly been imprisoned and faced other reprisals.

The Ministry of Islamic Affairs supervises and finances the construction and maintenance of almost all mosques in the country, although over 30% of all mosques in Saudi Arabia are built and endowed by private persons. The Ministry pays the salaries of imams (prayer leaders) and others who work in the mosques. A governmental committee defines the qualifications of imams. The CPVPV, &quot;religious police&quot;, or &quot;Mutawwa&#x27;in&quot; is a government entity, and its chairman has ministerial status. The Committee sends out armed and unarmed people into the public to ensure that Saudi citizens and expatriates living in the kingdom follow the Islamic mores, at least in public.

Saudi law prohibits alcoholic beverages and pork products in the country as they are considered to be against Islam. Those violating the law are handed harsh punishments. Drug trafficking is always punished by death.

Under Saudi law conversion by a Muslim to another religion is considered apostasy, a crime punishable by death. 
In March 2014, the Saudi interior ministry issued a royal decree branding all atheists as terrorists, which defines terrorism as &quot;calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based.&quot;

Non-Muslims are also strictly banned by Saudi Arabia from the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina. On highways, religious police officers may divert them or hand out a fine. In the cities themselves, road checks are randomly conducted.

Saudi Arabia prohibits public non-Muslim religious activities. Non-Muslim worshipers risk arrest, imprisonment, lashing, deportation, and sometimes torture for engaging in overt religious activity that attracts official attention. In July 2012 the Bodu Bala Sena, an extremist Buddhist organization based in Sri Lanka, reported that Premanath Pereralage Thungasiri, a Sri Lankan Buddhist employed in Saudi Arabia, had been arrested for worshiping the Buddha in his employer&#x27;s home, and that plans were being made to behead him. The Sri Lankan Embassy has rejected these reports. In the past, Sri Lankan officials have also rejected reports regarding labor conditions issued by New York-based Human Rights Watch.

The government has stated publicly, including before the U.N. Committee on Human Rights in Geneva, that its policy is to protect the right of non-Muslims to worship privately. However, non-Muslim organizations have claimed that there are no explicit guidelines for distinguishing between public and private worship, such as the number of persons permitted to attend and the types of locations that are acceptable. Such lack of clarity, as well as instances of arbitrary enforcement by the authorities, obliges most non-Muslims to worship in such a manner as to avoid discovery. Those detained for non-Muslim worship almost always are deported by authorities after sometimes lengthy periods of arrest during investigation. In some cases, they also are sentenced to receive lashes prior to deportation.

In 2022, there were no religious-worker visas, but non-Muslim clergy were able to enter the country to work in their communities. They were also able to bring in religious items, including books.

Proselytizing by non-Muslims, including the distribution of non-Muslim religious materials such as Bibles, is illegal. Muslims or non-Muslims wearing religious symbols of any kind in public risk confrontation with the Mutawwa&#x27;in. In 2001, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs ran approximately 50 &quot;Call and Guidance&quot; centers employing approximately 500 persons work to convert foreigners to Islam. Some non-Muslim foreigners convert to Islam during their stay in the country. The press often carries articles about such conversions, including testimonials. The press as well as government officials publicized the conversion of the Italian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Torquato Cardilli, in late 2001.

The government requires noncitizen residents to carry a Saudi residence permit (Iqama) for identification in place of their passports.
Among other information, these contain a religious designation for &quot;Muslim&quot; or &quot;non-Muslim.&quot;

Members of the Shi’a minority are the subjects of officially sanctioned political and economic discrimination. The authorities permit the celebration of the Shi’a holiday of Ashura in the eastern province city of Qatif. No other Ashura celebrations are permitted in the country, and many Shi’a travel to Qatif or to Bahrain to participate in Ashura celebrations.

Shi’a have declined government offers to build state-supported mosques because they fear the government would prohibit the incorporation and display of Shi’a motifs in any such mosques. The government seldom permits private construction of Shi’a mosques. During 2013, virtually all existing mosques in al-Ahsa were unable to obtain licenses and faced the threat of closure at any time and in other parts of the country were not allowed to build Shia-specific mosques.

In 2022, the government executed 81 men, including 41 Saudi Shia, in the largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdom&#x27;s history.

Members of the Shi’a minority are discriminated against in government employment, especially with respect to positions that relate to national security, such as in the military or in the Ministry of the Interior. The government restricts employment of Shi’a in the oil and petrochemical industries. The government also discriminates against Shi’a in higher education through unofficial restrictions on the number of Shi’a admitted to universities. This discrimination has been noted for many years.

Under the provisions of Shari’a law as practiced in the country, judges may discount the testimony of people who are not practicing Muslims or who do not adhere to the official interpretation of Islam. Legal sources report that testimony by Shi’a is often ignored in courts of law or is deemed to have less weight than testimony by Sunnis. Sentencing under the legal system is not uniform. Laws and regulations state that defendants should be treated equally; however, under Shari’a as interpreted and applied in the country, crimes against Muslims may result in harsher penalties than those against non-Muslims. Information regarding government practices was generally incomplete because judicial proceedings usually were not publicized or were closed to the public, despite provisions in the criminal procedure law requiring court proceedings to be open.

In the past Customs officials have regularly opened postal material and cargo to search for non-Muslim materials, such as Bibles and religious videotapes; such materials have been subject to confiscation.

Sunni Islamic religious education is mandatory in public schools at all levels. Private schools must also teach the same curriculum, except for private international schools which must teach Islamic studies. In 2022 the government reduced the number of hours required for religious education, in favor of more study time for Arabic and STEM.

In 2007, Saudi religious police detained Shiite pilgrims participating in the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage, allegedly calling them &quot;infidels in Mecca and Medina&quot;.

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in its 2019 report named Saudi Arabia as one of the world&#x27;s worst violators of religious freedom.

Until 2016, the kingdom only used the lunar Islamic calendar, not the international Gregorian calendar, but in 2016 the kingdom announced its switch to the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes. Daily life is influenced by Islamic observance. Some businesses decide to close three or four times per day for 30 to 45 minutes during business hours while employees and customers are sent off to pray. The weekend is Friday-Saturday, not Saturday-Sunday because Friday is the holiest day for Muslims. For many years only two religious holidays were publicly recognized – &quot;ʿĪd al-Fiṭr&quot; and &quot;ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā&quot;. (&quot;ʿĪd al-Fiṭr&quot; is &quot;the biggest&quot; holiday, a three-day period of &quot;feasting, gift-giving and general letting go&quot;).

In 2004, approximately half of the broadcast airtime of Saudi state television was devoted to religious issues. Ninety per cent of books published in the kingdom were on religious subjects, and most of the doctorates awarded by its universities were in Islamic studies. In the state school system, about half of the material taught is religious. In contrast, assigned readings over 12 years of primary and secondary schooling devoted to covering the history, literature, and cultures of the non-Muslim world come to a total of about 40 pages.

&quot;Fierce religious resistance&quot; had to be overcome to permit such innovations as paper money (in 1951), female education (1964), and television (1965) and the abolition of slavery (1962). Public support for the traditional political/religious structure of the kingdom is so strong that one researcher interviewing Saudis found virtually no support for reforms to secularize the state.

Celebration of other (non-Wahhabi) Islamic holidays, such as the Muhammad&#x27;s birthday and the Day of Ashura, (an important holiday for the 10–25% of the population that is Shīʿa Muslim), are tolerated only when celebrated locally and on a small scale. Shias also face systematic discrimination in employment, education, the justice system according to Human Rights Watch. Non-Muslim festivals like Christmas, Easter, Halloween, and New Year were not tolerated until recently. No churches, temples or other non-Muslim houses of worship are permitted in the country. Proselytizing by non-Muslims and conversion by Muslims to another religion is illegal. In legal compensation court cases (&quot;Diyya&quot;) non-Muslim are awarded less than Muslims. Atheists are legally designated as terrorists. At least one religious minority, the Ahmadiyya Muslims, had its adherents deported, as they are legally banned from entering the country.

In a recent move to promote a modern image, Saudi Arabia banned the religious group known as &#x27;Tablighi Jamaat&#x27;. The announcement was made on social media by the country&#x27;s Minister of Islamic Affairs who warned people against association during the Friday sermon.

===Ahmadiyya===

Ahmadis are persecuted in Saudi Arabia on an ongoing basis. Although there have been many foreign workers and Saudi citizens belonging to the Ahmadiyya sect in Saudi Arabia, Ahmadis are officially banned from entering the country and from performing the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.

By 2022, authorities indicated that they considered Ahmadiyya Muslims to be Muslims; however the group&#x27;s legal status is unclear.

===Blasphemy and apostasy===

Saudi Arabia has criminal statutes making it illegal for a Muslim to change religion or to renounce Islam, which is defined as apostasy and punishable by death. For this reason, Saudi Arabia is known as &#x27;the hell for apostates&#x27;, with many ex-Muslims seeking to leave or flee the country before their non-belief is discovered, and living pseudonymous second lives on the Internet.

On 3 September 1992, Sadiq &#x27;Abdul-Karim Malallah was publicly beheaded in Al-Qatif in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Eastern Province after being convicted of apostasy and blasphemy. Sadiq Malallah, a Shi&#x27;a Muslim from Saudi Arabia, was arrested in April 1988 and charged with throwing stones at a police patrol. He was reportedly held in solitary confinement for long periods during his first months in detention and tortured prior to his first appearance before a judge in July 1988. The judge reportedly asked him to convert from Shi&#x27;a Islam to Sunni Wahhabi Islam, and allegedly promised him a lighter sentence if he complied. After he refused to do so, he was taken to al-Mabahith al-&#x27;Amma (General Intelligence) Prison in Dammam where he was held until April 1990. He was then transferred to al-Mabahith al-&#x27;Amma Prison in Riyadh, where he remained until the date of his execution. Sadiq Malallah is believed to have been involved in efforts to secure improved rights for Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a Muslim minority.

In 1994, Hadi Al-Mutif a teenager who was a Shi’a Ismaili Muslim from Najran in southwestern Saudi Arabia, made a remark that a court deemed blasphemous and was sentenced to death for apostasy. , he was still in prison, had alleged physical abuse and mistreatment during his years of incarceration, and had reportedly made numerous suicide attempts.

In 2012, Saudi poet and journalist Hamza Kashgari became the subject of a major controversy after being accused of insulting the Islamic prophet Mohammad in three short messages (tweets) published on the Twitter online social networking service. King Abdullah ordered that Kashgari be arrested &quot;for crossing red lines and denigrating religious beliefs in God and His Prophet.&quot;

Ahmad Al Shamri from the town of Hafar al-Batin, was arrested on charges of atheism and blasphemy after allegedly using social media to state that he renounced Islam and Mohammad, he was sentenced to death in February 2015.
In January 2019, 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed fled Saudi Arabia after having renounced Islam and being abused by her family. On her way to Australia, she was held by Thai authorities in Bangkok while her father tried to take her back, but Rahaf managed to use social media to attract significant attention to her case. After diplomatic intervention, she was eventually granted asylum in Canada, where she arrived and settled soon after.

===Witchcraft and sorcery===

In the past, the country has used the death penalty for crimes of sorcery and witchcraft and claims that it is doing so in &quot;public interest&quot;. In 2022, sorcery is still an arrestable offence.

===Forced religious conversion===

Forced conversion, as per the principles of Islam is not allowed

In July 2012, two men who had evangelized a young woman who subsequently converted to Christianity were arrested in the Saudi Gulf city Al-Khabar, on charges of &quot;forcible conversion&quot;. The girl&#x27;s father had laid charges against the two men after he failed to convince the young woman to return home from Lebanon and abandon her new faith.

==Saudi practices as &quot;religious apartheid&quot;==
Testifying before the U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus on June 4, 2002, in a briefing entitled &quot;Human Rights in Saudi Arabia: The Role of Women&quot;, Ali Al-Ahmed, Director of the Saudi Institute, stated:
Saudi Arabia is a glaring example of religious apartheid. The religious institutions from government clerics to judges, to religious curricula, and all religious instructions in media are restricted to the Wahhabi understanding of Islam, adhered to by less than 40% of the population. The Saudi government communized Islam, through its monopoly of both religious thoughts and practice. Wahhabi Islam is imposed and enforced on all Saudis regardless of their religious orientations. The Wahhabi sect does not tolerate other religious or ideological beliefs, Muslim or not. Religious symbols by Muslims, Christians, Jews and other believers are all banned. The Saudi embassy in Washington is a living example of religious apartheid. In its 50 years, there has not been a single non-Sunni Muslim diplomat in the embassy. The branch of Imam Mohamed Bin Saud University in Fairfax, Virginia instructs its students that Shia Islam is a Jewish conspiracy.

In 2003, Amir Taheri quoted a Shi&#x27;ite businessman from Dhahran as saying &quot;It is not normal that there are no Shi&#x27;ite army officers, ministers, governors, mayors and ambassadors in this kingdom. This form of religious apartheid is as intolerable as was apartheid based on race.&quot;

In 2007, Saudi religious police detained Shiite pilgrims participating in the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage, allegedly calling them &quot;infidels in Mecca and Medina&quot;.

Until March 1, 2004, the official government website stated that Jews were forbidden from entering the country. Prejudice against Jews is fairly high in the kingdom. While the webpage has been modified, no one who admits to be Jewish, on the visa paperwork or has an Israeli government stamp on their passport is allowed in the kingdom.

Alan Dershowitz wrote in 2002, &quot;in Saudi Arabia apartheid is practiced against non-Muslims, with signs indicating that Muslims must go to certain areas and non-Muslims to others.&quot;

On 14 December 2005, Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Democratic Representative Shelley Berkley introduced a bill in Congress urging American divestiture from Saudi Arabia, and giving as its rationale (among other things) &quot;Saudi Arabia is a country that practices religious apartheid and continuously subjugates its citizenry, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to a specific interpretation of Islam.&quot; Freedom House showed on its website, on a page tiled &quot;Religious apartheid in Saudi Arabia&quot;, a picture of a sign showing Muslim-only and non-Muslim roads.

In 2007, there were news reports that according to Saudi policy for tourists it was not permissible to bring non-Muslim religious symbols and books into the kingdom as they were subject to confiscation, and that the U.S. State Department disputed this, saying that the regulation restrictions were no longer in place. The 2007 U.S The U.S State Department International Religious Freedom (IRF) report detailed several cases in which bibles were confiscated in Saudi Arabia, but said that there were fewer reports in 2007 of government officials confiscating religious materials than in previous years and no reports that customs officials had confiscated religious materials from travelers. In the past the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) and security forces of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) conducted some raids on private non-Muslim religious gatherings and sometimes confiscated the personal religious materials of non-Muslims. The 2022 IRF report noted that there were no reports of visitors having their personal, non-Islamic religious materials confiscated; however the media did report the confiscation of sorcery-related items.

==2023 freedom reports==
In 2023, the country was scored zero out of 4 for religious freedom. In the same year, it was ranked as the 13th worst place in the world to be a Christian.

<doc id="322745" wikidata="Q375932" url="?curid=322745" title="Henri Toivonen">
<text>Henri Pauli Toivonen (25 August 1956 – 2 May 1986) was a Finnish rally driver born in Jyväskylä, the home of Rally Finland. His father, Pauli, was the 1968 European Rally Champion for Porsche and his brother, Harri, became a professional circuit racer.

Toivonen&#x27;s first World Rally Championship victory came with a Talbot Sunbeam Lotus at the 1980 Lombard RAC Rally in Great Britain, just after his 24th birthday. He had the record of being the youngest driver ever to win a world rally until his countryman Jari-Matti Latvala won the 2008 Swedish Rally at the age of 22. After driving for Opel and Porsche, Toivonen was signed by Lancia. Despite nearly ending up paralysed at the Rally Costa Smeralda early in 1985, he returned to rallying later that year. He won the last event of the season, the RAC Rally, as well as the 1986 season opener, the Monte Carlo Rally, which his father had won exactly 20 years earlier.

Toivonen died in a crash on 2 May 1986 while leading the Tour de Corse rally in Corsica. His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when their Lancia Delta S4 plunged down a ravine and exploded. The crash had no close witnesses and the only remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe, making it impossible to determine the cause. Within hours, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying&#x27;s supercar era.

Toivonen started his career in circuit racing and was also very competitive on tarmac. He raced successfully in a European Endurance Championship event, achieved praise from Eddie Jordan, in whose Formula Three team Toivonen made a few guest appearances, and impressed in his Formula One test for March Grand Prix. The annual Race of Champions, originally organised in Toivonen&#x27;s memory, awards the winning individual driver the &quot;Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy&quot;.

==Early career==
Toivonen had strong ties to rallying at an early age. He was born in Jyväskylä, the city which has hosted the Rally Finland since 1951. His father, Pauli Toivonen, was a successful international rally driver who would go on to win the Monte Carlo, 1000 Lakes and Acropolis rallies and become the 1968 European Rally Champion. Henri Toivonen learned to drive when he was five years old, but despite his rallying connections, started competition in circuit racing. He began with karts and won the Finnish Cup in touring cars before switching to Formula Vee, winning one round of the Scandinavian Championship in his first year. Toivonen graduated to Formula Super Vee the following year and won a round of the European Championship, as well as becoming the 1977 Finnish Champion in the Formula Vee class. Due to his family&#x27;s concerns about the safety of circuit racing, he switched to rallying full-time. Toivonen&#x27;s kart was purchased by the parents of a 6-year-old Mika Häkkinen, who would later be a two-time Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champion.

Due to Finnish legislation, which at that time limited new drivers to a top speed of on open roads, Toivonen was unable to compete in rallying until he was 19 years old. With Antero Lindqvist as his co-driver, he made his World Rally Championship debut at the 1975 1000 Lakes Rally (now the &quot;Neste Oil Rally Finland&quot;), driving a privately entered Simca Rallye 2. He retired from the rally during the 36th special stage due to a broken sump. While still focusing on his circuit racing career, he competed in his second world rally two years later and finished fifth in the 1977 1000 Lakes in a Chrysler Avenger.

Toivonen started his 1978 season at the Arctic Rally, the second round of both the European Rally Championship and World Rally Championship&#x27;s &quot;FIA Cup for Drivers&quot;, the predecessor to the official drivers&#x27; world championship which was established in 1979. He finished second, 3:41 minutes behind Ari Vatanen, and over seven minutes ahead of Markku Alén, who would go on to win the Cup. Toivonen went on to compete in two world championship rallies for Citroën. Although he did not finish either event, his driving attracted attention; a private Porsche team offered Toivonen a car for the 1000 Lakes Rally, as did Chrysler for the Lombard RAC Rally. At his home event, Toivonen had to retire due to an engine failure, but he finished ninth at the RAC Rally. That same year, Toivonen captured his first rally win at the Nordic Rally, an event in the Finnish Rally Championship. In the 1979 season, he gathered rallying experience by competing in 15 rallies in the British, Finnish and European championships. Toivonen also competed in two WRC events: the 1000 Lakes with a Fiat 131 Abarth and the RAC with a Ford Escort RS. He retired from both, but at his home event he had been matching the pace of the leaders before leaving the road. These performances led to a contract with the factory Talbot Competition team for the 1980 season.

==Works career==

===Talbot (1980–81)===

Toivonen&#x27;s first season driving for a major car manufacturer&#x27;s &#x27;works&#x27; team was largely a trial year. He started the season by winning the Arctic Rally in January, but only drove his Talbot Sunbeam Lotus in four selected World Rally Championship events. His exuberant driving style often led to crashes, and his results were often not representative of his pace. In hopes of better results, the team partnered Toivonen with three different co-drivers during the season: Antero Lindqvist, Paul White and Neil Wilson. At the 1000 Lakes Rally, Toivonen retired due to an accident during the 11th special stage. At the next rally in Sanremo with Lindqvist, Toivonen finished fifth. In late November, Toivonen, this time partnered by White, surprised both experts and spectators by winning the Lombard RAC Rally, over four minutes ahead of runner-up Hannu Mikkola. Neither Toivonen nor Talbot were expected to be competitive in the rally. In an interview published in Autosport three days before the rally started, Toivonen himself had not expected to challenge for the win:

At 24 years and 86 days, he remained the youngest driver to win a WRC event until his countryman Jari-Matti Latvala won the 2008 Swedish Rally at the age of 22. Latvala stated that &quot;It&#x27;s a super feeling, it&#x27;s almost unbelievable. Henri (Toivonen) was one of my idols and secretly I&#x27;ve always wanted to beat his record as the youngest winner.&quot; Over 20 years after the 1980 RAC, Paul White (nicknamed &quot;Chalkie&quot; by Toivonen) commented that he still receives questions about the rally and Henri Toivonen. He noted that the Talbot team, run by Des O&#x27;Dell and 15 full-time personnel, was much smaller than other works teams and &quot;had to draft in &#x27;mercenary&#x27; mechanics to help.&quot; Toivonen&#x27;s results led to another year in the Talbot squad. In the 1981 season, he was signed up for a larger WRC programme and had a new co-driver, Fred Gallagher, who would later partner Juha Kankkunen and Björn Waldegård in a Toyota Celica Twincam Turbo. Toivonen&#x27;s rear-wheel drive Group 2 Sunbeam Lotus was now less competitive against the Group 4 cars and the all-wheel-drive Audi Quattro, but despite four retirements, the second places at Rally Portugal and Sanremo, as well as a fifth place at the Monte Carlo Rally, resulted in a seventh place overall in the drivers&#x27; world championship. Together with more consistent teammate Guy Fréquelin, he brought Talbot a surprise manufacturers&#x27; title. He also competed in the last round of the British Open Rally Championship, the Audi Sport International Rally, and won the event.

===Opel (1982–83)===

For the 1982 season, Toivonen switched to the Rothmans-sponsored Opel team, which was co-managed by David Richards. Toivonen&#x27;s teammates were Ari Vatanen, who had won the previous year&#x27;s championship (with Richards as his co-driver), the 1980 and 1982 world champion Walter Röhrl and Jimmy McRae, the previous year&#x27;s British Rally Champion and father of future rally star Colin McRae. In his Ascona 400 debut in Portugal, Toivonen surprised the event favourites by leading the rally before retiring five stages from the finish. He competed in only four more WRC events, but finished on the podium twice, at the Acropolis Rally and at the RAC Rally. In the European Rally Championship, he participated in four rallies, registering three podiums and one retirement. He also made a guest appearance in one round of the British Formula Three circuit racing championship, where he finished tenth driving a Ralt RT3. In his Formula One test for March Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit, Toivonen was 1.4 seconds faster than the team&#x27;s regular driver Raul Boesel.
Toivonen continued with Opel into the 1983 season, now driving the Manta 400, which took advantage of the new Group B regulations. Although the Manta was a Group B car, it was underpowered against the likes of the Audi Quattro A2 and Lancia 037, which were controlling the world rally scene at the time. Toivonen achieved a win at the Manx International Rally, a round of the British Open Rally Championship and the European Rally Championship, in the Isle of Man, at his first attempt. He also finished first at the Mille Pistes rally in France, but the organisers decided to ban the Group B cars halfway through the event. Toivonen and his co-driver, Ian Grindrod, received only a consolation trophy. In the World Rally Championship, he retired in three rallies, finished sixth at the Monte Carlo Rally and fourth at the Rallye Sanremo. He also drove a Ferrari 308 GTB at the San Marino Rally, where he was co-driven by Juha Piironen for the first time. The pair retired from the event, but Piironen would become his main co-driver for the next two seasons, and later have a long and successful partnership with four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen. In late October, Toivonen again competed on the circuits. This time he entered two sportscar races, driving a Porsche 956 for Richard Lloyd Racing in the European Endurance Championship. He only practiced the car at Imola and did not race, but in the next race at Mugello, partnered with Derek Bell and Jonathan Palmer, he finished third.

===Porsche (1984)===

After a score of ten starts, two podiums, three other top six finishes and five retirements, Toivonen left Opel Team Europe for the 1984 season. He was linked to the lead drive at the Peugeot Talbot Sport, Peugeot&#x27;s new factory World Rally Championship team, but eventually signed to drive a Porsche 911 SC RS for the Rothmans-sponsored Porsche factory team in the European Rally Championship. The team was run by Prodrive, a new motorsport group set up by David Richards, Toivonen&#x27;s former boss at Opel. His European season with Porsche turned out to be a success. He started with two retirements, a third and a second place, but went on to win five rallies in a row and led the championship from Italian Lancia driver Carlo Capone. As Toivonen had a contract with Lancia for the World Rally Championship, and Lancia boss Cesare Fiorio wanted Capone to win the European title, it was suggested that Fiorio might enter Toivonen in WRC events to keep him away from important ERC rounds. However, Toivonen&#x27;s title campaign ended in a back injury and a resulting enforced rest that was expected to take up to two months. He missed several events and finished second in the championship behind Capone.

Toivonen&#x27;s WRC contract with Lancia Martini consisted of five events. Fiorio stated that the team needed another top driver as &quot;Audi will have four top drivers next year so it would be very difficult competing with only two.&quot; Toivonen had his Lancia 037 debut in Portugal with very limited testing experience: &quot;It has been snowing in Italy every time I have been to try this car, so I don&#x27;t know its limits.&quot; However, similarly to his Opel Ascona 400 debut at the same event two years ago, Toivonen immediately took the lead and set several fastest stage times before retiring. This time the retirement was not caused by a broken clutch, but a mistake and a crash by Toivonen. After a retirement also in Greece, he finished third in his home event, the 1000 Lakes Rally. These three remained Toivonen&#x27;s only WRC events of the season as his back injury forced him to miss the Sanremo and RAC rallies. Before Sanremo, Markku Alén re-signed with Lancia and Fiorio stated he wanted to sign Toivonen with a similar two-year contract, depending on the condition of his back and his contractual situation with Rothmans Porsche, who had claimed Toivonen had already re-signed with them. Toivonen chose to become a full-fledged Lancia driver for the 1985 season.

===Lancia (1985–86)===

The 1985 season started badly when Toivonen crashed his Lancia 037 into a brick wall at the Rally Costa Smeralda, in the European Championship, seriously injuring his back and breaking three vertebrae in his neck. At the beginning of May, Lancia drivers Toivonen and Alén lost a friend and team-mate, when Italian driver Attilio Bettega crashed fatally during the fourth special stage at the Tour de Corse. Toivonen made his comeback from his injuries at the 1000 Lakes Rally in August and finished fourth. He finished third at the next rally in Sanremo, his final event with the car. The 037 did not suit Toivonen&#x27;s driving style and had fallen well behind Audi and Peugeot in terms of performance, as it was rear-wheel drive and had only compared to the 440 of Peugeot and 500 of Audi. It was replaced by the Lancia Delta S4 for the final event of the season: the RAC Rally. The Delta S4 had all-wheel drive and was both supercharged and turbocharged, the former increasing power in the middle of the engine&#x27;s speed range and the latter boosting power at higher engine speeds. The car could reportedly accelerate from 0 to in 2.3 seconds, on a gravel road. The Delta S4 turned out to be a success. Toivonen won the rally and Alén finished second only 56 seconds behind. Although Toivonen competed in only four world rallies in 1985, his results placed him career-best sixth overall in the championship.
The 1986 season started with a dominant win for Toivonen at the Monte Carlo Rally with new co-driver Sergio Cresto. Fellow &quot;Flying Finns&quot; Timo Salonen and Hannu Mikkola finished second and third. Toivonen&#x27;s father, Pauli Toivonen, had won the event 20 years earlier after ten cars, including the first four to cross the finishing line, were disqualified due to having non-standard headlights. The disqualification had caused an uproar and Prince Rainier of Monaco refused to attend the prize-giving ceremony. Henri Toivonen&#x27;s victory caused his father to comment &quot;now the name of Toivonen has been cleared&quot;. The Monte Carlo win made Toivonen the favourite for the title. However, at the Swedish Rally he retired from the lead due to an engine failure. At the next rally in Portugal, Joaquim Santos lost control of his Ford RS200 on a special stage and plunged into the crowd. The accident killed three spectators and injured more than 30. Toivonen along with all the other factory team drivers decided to withdraw from the event, but Lancia disapproved of the retirement. Toivonen stated that &quot;the Lancia team will not accept anything but a win.&quot; During the Portuguese rally, Toivonen is often reported to have tested his Delta S4 at the Estoril circuit and to have set a fastest lap time that would have qualified him in sixth position at the 1986 Portuguese Grand Prix. MTV3 and ESPN, citing Kankkunen and Fiorio, respectively, looked into the claim a few decades later and came to a skeptical conclusion. Red Bull explored the story further by interviewing former Lancia manager Ninni Russo, whose connections stated that Toivonen had made a time on the full circuit that &quot;was in the first ten of the F1 cars from their test at Estoril two or three weeks before.&quot; Despite the setbacks, Toivonen remained the title favourite with no driver seeming able to match his pace.

==Death==

The 1986 Tour de Corse, a world rally on narrow and very twisty mountain roads around the island of Corsica, began on Thursday, 1 May. Toivonen had a sore throat and was suffering from the flu, but he insisted on driving after having lost his championship lead during the last three rallies due to retiring the car in Sweden, the Lancia team withdrawing from the tragic Portugal event and Toivonen not even competing in the Kenyan Safari Rally. According to several sources, he was also taking medicine to treat fever. Despite his ill health, he was taking stage win after stage win and leading the 1017 km rally by a large margin. After the first leg, Toivonen commented:

Toivonen was complaining about the car being too fast and powerful for a rally like the Tour de Corse. He found it very hard to keep the 600 hp Lancia balanced on the road and admitted it was very exhausting. A number of other rally drivers driving other Group B cars in the rally shared his concerns, and in a short interview before he steered his Lancia into the 18th stage, Toivonen made a comment which would remain his last words in public:

During the second leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh kilometre of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen&#x27;s Lancia went off the side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver&#x27;s seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have had time to get out if they were still alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.

Toivonen&#x27;s crash remains a mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, it proved to be impossible to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen&#x27;s team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.

Walter Röhrl later confirmed that Toivonen was taking medicine for his flu. In a later interview with &quot;Motorsport News&quot;, fellow driver Malcolm Wilson claimed that since the neck injuries sustained in his 1985 Costa Smeralda crash, Toivonen had suffered from random blackouts but did not tell his team because he did not want to lose his place at Lancia. At least one person who attended the aftermath of the crash reported that there were no skid marks on the tarmac, fuelling speculation that Toivonen could have suddenly lost consciousness at the wheel, but the cause of the crash is still unknown.

===Aftermath===
Within hours of Toivonen&#x27;s crash, Jean-Marie Balestre and the FISA decided to ban Group B cars from competing in the 1987 season. The planned Group S was also cancelled and manufacturers were stuck with cars they could not race. Audi and Ford withdrew from Group B racing immediately, but other teams competed until the end of the season. The Tour de Corse continued the next day and Bruno Saby won with his Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 E2. Prior to Santos&#x27; and Toivonen&#x27;s crashes, many commentators and drivers had warned of accidents resulting from drivers simply being unable to control their powerful cars. FISA was criticised for recognising the problem too late.

An FISA investigation later proved that drivers&#x27; reactions were too slow to keep up with the speed of the Group B cars, and drivers&#x27; eyes could not adjust their focus between the fast corners, resulting in tunnel vision. However, due to the high speed of the cars, rallying was more popular among spectators than ever. FISA had to face criticism also for overreacting to Toivonen&#x27;s accident. John Davenport, author and former rally co-driver, stated in 2004 that &quot;Group B could have been tamed. They were only unsafe in so much as the fuel system, which caused Toivonen&#x27;s death, and the crowd control needed changing – it wasn&#x27;t the actual cars.&quot; Group B cars have been described as &quot;too fast to race.&quot;

==Legacy==
Toivonen was known as a competitive driver both on loose (gravel, dirt, sand, snow and ice) and tarmac surfaces, and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying. After becoming a rally driver, he still competed in some circuit racing events, successfully in a European Endurance Championship event and also in a few races for Eddie Jordan&#x27;s British Formula Three Championship team. Jordan called Toivonen&#x27;s performances &quot;incredible&quot; and compared him to Ayrton Senna, whom Toivonen had raced against while in Formula Three. After Toivonen&#x27;s death, Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One: 

During his World Rally Championship career, Toivonen competed in 40 world rallies, gathering three wins, nine podium places, 185 stage wins and retiring 22 times. With only wins and retirements in the last five of his rallies, he was at the peak of his career in the Lancia Delta S4, after finally finding a car that was both competitive and suitable for his driving style. However, Toivonen admitted having problems with the car: &quot;I may have won the RAC Rally with Lancia, but I just did not know how to drive it. It seemed to have a mind of its own.&quot; Lancia team boss Cesare Fiorio later claimed that Toivonen was the only driver who could really control the Delta S4. Toivonen often complained about the S4 during TV interviews, often saying the car was difficult to drive- particularly on tarmac- where more
power could be put down, therefore making the car faster in such conditions.

In a Henri Toivonen obituary, titled &quot;Rebel With a Cause&quot;, published in &quot;Motor&quot; five days after Toivonen&#x27;s fatal accident, rally author Martin Holmes named him a &quot;rebel driver&quot;, and proof that young drivers can be successful in rallying, a sport which had previously been dominated by older, more experienced drivers such as fellow Finn Hannu Mikkola, Swede Stig Blomqvist and German Walter Röhrl. However, Toivonen could not achieve the necessary level of consistency to avoid a number of high speed accidents. Prior to the introduction of the Delta S4, he was known for his ability to make up large amounts of time in single stages. This led to a number of stage wins but also to several bad accidents resulting from driving mistakes. Toivonen&#x27;s career almost ended in early 1985, when he was nearly paralysed in the Rally Costa Smeralda accident – 1985 would have been his first full WRC season, excluding the extremely arduous endurance events in Africa- the Safari Rally and the Ivory Coast Rally for which he was never entered in his career- in fact, Toivonen never did a single rally outside Europe- not even the Safari Rally, which was considered one of the most prestigious rally events up until 2002, when it was taken off the WRC calendar. The World Rally Archive&#x27;s Hall of Fame now names him an &quot;icon for the one of the most controversial periods of rallying.&quot;
Toivonen was buried in Espoo, where his family moved from Jyväskylä when Toivonen was still very young. In Corsica, a marble slab dedicated to him and Sergio Cresto was placed at the curve where Toivonen drove out. The memorial place always has an unopened bottle of Martini, which is a reference to Toivonen&#x27;s Martini-sponsored Lancia factory team. As of 2006, a local resident puts new flowers by the slab every day. In July, the Rally Marca Trevigiana in Italy was titled &quot;Memorial Henri Toivonen&quot; in honour of Toivonen. The rally was stopped after a fatal accident on the fourth stage. In 1988, former rally driver and arguably the most successful female race car driver in history, Michèle Mouton, organised the first Race of Champions to commemorate Toivonen&#x27;s death. The Race of Champions was originally restricted to rally drivers, but became even more popular with the introduction of Formula One and NASCAR stars. The &quot;Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy&quot; is still awarded to the winner of the individual event every year.

Another trophy bearing Toivonen&#x27;s name was the &quot;Henri Toivonen Grand Attack Trophy&quot;, which was awarded by Peugeot&#x27;s Rally Challenge, organised by Des O&#x27;Dell, &quot;to the driver who most embodied the spirit shown by the young Finn.&quot; In 2006, Toivonen was honoured at the Neste Oil Rally Finland. An exhibition in memory of him was opened on 17 August in the Rally HQ Jyväskylä Paviljonki. The interviewing event was attended by his former teammate Markku Alén, former co-driver Juha Piironen, current Ford factory team boss Malcolm Wilson and his brother Harri Toivonen. Harri Toivonen quit his racing career in 2002, ending the 40-year racing history of the Toivonen family.

<text>The fez (, ), also called tarboosh/tarboush (), is a felt headdress in the shape of a short, cylindrical, peakless hat, usually red, typically with a black tassel attached to the top. The name &quot;fez&quot; may refer to the Moroccan city of Fez, where the dye to color the hat was extracted from crimson berries. However, its origins are disputed.

The modern fez owes much of its popularity to the Ottoman era. It became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century. In 1827, Mahmud II mandated its use as a modern headdress for his new army, the Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye. The decision was inspired by the Ottoman naval command, who had previously returned from the Maghreb having embraced the style. In 1829, Mahmud issued new regulations mandating use of the fez by all civil and religious officials. The intention was to replace the turban, which acted as a marker of identity and so divided rather than unified the population. A century later, in 1925, the fez was outlawed in Turkey as part of Atatürk&#x27;s reforms. Since then, it has not been a part of Turkish men&#x27;s clothing.

The fez has been used as part of soldiers&#x27; uniforms in many armies and wars for centuries, including the Bahawalpur Regiment in Pakistan as late as the 1960s. It is still worn in parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and in Cape Town, South Africa. It has also been adopted by various fraternal orders in the English-speaking world.

==Etymology==
The fez (, ) is also known as a tarboosh (), also spelt tarboush. The word &quot;tarboosh is a&quot; variant of شَرْبُوش (&quot;šarbūš&quot;), borrowed from , a compound of sar, “head” and puš, “cover” (meaning &quot;headgear&quot;). The dissimilation is speculated to have been motivated by Kipchak تر (tär, “sweat”), as the headpiece is fit to conceal (pôš) perspiration. Some sources suggest that tarboosh is a Turkish word composed of two elements, ter (&quot;sweat&quot;) and pošu (&quot;a light turban cloth&quot;). via the Turkish language, from Ottoman Turkish تيرپوس (&quot;terpos&quot;), and is used mainly in the countries of the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan). 

The fez takes its name from the Moroccan city of Fez, due to it being the source of the crimson berry once used to dye the felt.

==History==
The origins of the hat are obscure. It is either of ancient Greek, Tunisian, Moroccan, or Turkish origin. It was popular especially during the later period of the Ottoman Empire and its use spread throughout the empire, and much of its popularity derives from this era.

Initially, the fez was a brimless red, white, or black bonnet over which a turban was wrapped (similar to a wrapped keffiyeh). Later the turban was eliminated, the bonnet shortened, and the color fixed to red. Praying while wearing a fez—instead of a headdress with brim—was easier because Muslims put their heads to the ground during Salah (daily prayers).

The tarboosh was depicted as an element of Turkish clothing as early as around 1460. Mehmed the Conqueror wore a jeweled tarboosh wrapped in a white &quot;sarık&quot; to signify his right of the conquest of Constantinople. In 1826, Sultan Mahmud II of the Ottoman Empire suppressed the Janissaries and began sweeping reforms of the military. The modernised military adopted Western style uniforms and, as headdresses, the fez with a cloth wrapped around it. In 1827, 50,000 fezzes were ordered from Tunis for the sultan&#x27;s troops. In 1829 the Sultan ordered his civil officials to wear the plain fez, and banned the wearing of turbans. The intention was to coerce the populace at large to update to the fez, and the plan was successful. This was a radically egalitarian measure, which replaced the elaborate sumptuary laws that signaled rank, religion, and occupation, foreshadowing the Tanzimat reforms. Although tradesmen and artisans generally rejected the fez, it became a symbol of modernity throughout the Near East, inspiring similar decrees in other nations (such as Iran in 1873).

The original centre of production appears to have been in Tunis. To meet escalating demand, skilled fez makers were induced to immigrate from Tunisia to Istanbul, where factories were established in the neighborhood of Eyüp. Styles soon multiplied, with nuances of shape, height, material, and hue competing in the market. The striking scarlet and merlot colors of the fez were initially achieved through an extract of cornel. However, the invention of low-cost synthetic dyes soon shifted production of the hat to the factories of Strakonice, Czech Republic (then in the Austrian Empire).

The 1908 Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina resulted in a boycott of Austrian goods, which became known as the &quot;Fez Boycott&quot; due to the near-monopoly the Austrians then held on the production of the hat. Although the headdress survived, the year-long boycott brought the end of its universality in the Ottoman Empire as other styles became socially acceptable.

The societal position of the fez as a symbol of tradition led to its ban in Turkey in 1925 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in the Hat Revolution, part of his modernizing reforms. It was banned for similar reasons in 1958 in Egypt by Gamal Abdel Nasser government, with Cairo having been one of the most important centers of production of the fez up until then. Fez production has subsequently resumed in Egypt, but its sale is largely aimed at tourists.

=== Symbolism ===

The fez was a symbol not only of Ottoman affiliation but also of religious adherence to Islam. It was also the main headdress for Christians and Jews during the Ottoman Empire. Jewish men wore the fez and referred to it by the Arabic name &quot;Tarboush&quot;, especially if they spoke Arabic (Egyptian, Syrian and Palestinian Jews). In southern Asia, the fez had been adopted due to its links with the Ottoman Empire.

Through the 19th and early 20th centuries the fez was the preferred headwear for Christians and Muslims in the Balkans, which at the time was still mostly under Ottoman suzerainty. There were variations on the fez in the Balkan states, mainly involving the addition of religious symbols on the front. In semi-independent Montenegro, a client state of the Ottoman Empire that enjoyed complete autonomy, its Orthodox citizens wore their fezzes with a Greek cross on the front. Supporters of the Illyrian movement among South Slavs, especially in Croatia, wore their fezzes with a star and crescent on the front irrespective of religion, believing that the symbol predated the introduction of Islam in the Balkans. In 1850, regulations in the newly-autonomous Principality of Serbia concerning uniforms of ministerial officers specified the wear of red fezzes displaying the Serbian coat of arms. The fez was a symbol of Arab nationalist resistance against the Zionism during the Arab revolt in Palestine between 1936 and 1939 in the British Mandate.

Over time, the fez came to be seen as part of an Oriental cultural identity. On the one hand this led to its banning as part of modernising reforms in Turkey (1925) and later in Egypt (1958). On the other hand, the western orientalist perception of it during the 20th century west as exotic and romantic lead to its vogue as part of men&#x27;s luxury smoking outfit in the United States and the United Kingdom. It had also become associated with Ottoman domination across much of the former Ottoman empire and Arab world, though an exception is Morocco, where it became a symbol against French colonisation. Morocco remains one of the last places where the fez is occasionally worn, and remains a favoured part of royal court dress.

==Military use==

A version of the fez was used as an arming cap for the 1400–1700s version of the mail armor head protector (a round metal plate or skull-cap, around which hung a curtain of mail to protect the neck and upper shoulder). The red fez with blue tassel was the standard headdress of the Turkish Army from the 1840s until the introduction of a khaki service dress and peakless sun helmet in 1910. The only significant exceptions were cavalry and some artillery units who wore a lambskin hat with colored cloth tops. Albanian levies wore a white version of the fez, resembling their traditional qeleshe. During World War I the fez was still worn by some naval reserve units and occasionally by soldiers when off duty. The Evzones (light infantry) regiments of the Greek Army wore their own distinctive version of the fez from 1837 until World War II. It now survives in the parade uniform of the Presidential Guard in Athens.

From the mid-19th century on, the fez was widely adopted as the headdress of locally recruited &quot;native&quot; soldiers among the various colonial troops of the world. The French North African regiments (Zouaves, Tirailleurs, and Spahis) wore wide, red fezzes with detachable tassels of various colors. It was an off-duty affectation of the Zouaves to wear their fezzes at different angles according to the regiment; French officers of North African units during the 1930s often wore the same fez as their men, with rank insignia attached. (Many volunteer Zouave regiments wore the French North African version of the fez during the American Civil War.) The Libyan battalions and squadrons of the Italian colonial forces wore lower, red fezzes over white skull caps. Somali and Eritrean regiments in Italian service wore high red fezzes with colored tassels that varied according to the unit. German askaris in East Africa wore their fezzes with khaki covers on nearly all occasions.

The Belgian Force Publique in the Congo wore large and floppy red fezzes similar to those of the French Tirailleurs Senegalais and the Portuguese Companhias Indigenas. The British King&#x27;s African Rifles (recruited in East Africa) wore high straight-sided fezzes in either red or black, while the West African Frontier Force wore a low red version. The Egyptian Army wore the classic Turkish model until 1950. The West India Regiment of the British Army wore a fez as part of its Zouave-style full dress until this unit was disbanded in 1928. The tradition is continued in the full dress of the band of the Barbados Regiment, with a white turban wrapped around the base.

While the fez was a colorful and picturesque item of uniform, it was in several ways an impractical headdress. If worn without a drab cover, it made the head a target for enemy fire, and it provided little protection from the sun. As a result, it was increasingly relegated to parade or off-duty wear by World War II. However, France&#x27;s West African &quot;tirailleurs&quot; continued to wear a khaki-covered version in the field until about 1943. During the final period of colonial rule in Africa (approximately 1945 to 1962), the fez was seen only as a full-dress item in French, British, Belgian, Spanish, and Portuguese African units, being replaced by wide-brimmed hats or forage caps on other occasions. Colonial police forces, however, usually retained the fez as normal duty wear for indigenous personnel.

Post-independence armies in Africa quickly discarded the fez as a colonial relic. It is, however, still worn by the ceremonial &quot;Garde Rouge&quot; in Senegal as part of their Spahi-style uniform, and by the Italian Bersaglieri in certain orders of dress. The Bersaglieri adopted the fez as an informal headdress through the influence of the French Zouaves, with whom they served in the Crimean War. The Italian Arditi in the First World War wore a black fez that later became a uniform item of the Mussolini Fascist regime. The Spanish Regulares (formerly Moorish) Tabors stationed in the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, in North Africa, retain a parade uniform that includes the fez and white cloaks. Filipino units organised in the early days of U.S. rule briefly wore black fezzes, and officers serving with Muslim personnel of the Philippines Constabulary were authorised to wear this headdress from 1909.
The Liberian Frontier Force, although not a colonial force, wore fezzes until the 1940s.

Bosnian infantry regiments in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire had been distinguished by wearing the fez, from their creation in 1885 until the end of World War I. They wore distinctive light blue or field grey uniforms, with a buckle showing an arm with a scimitar inside a shield as the symbol of Bosniak ethnicity. The primarily Bosniak Muslim 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, which was recruited from Bosnia, used a red or field grey fez with Waffen SS cap insignia during the latter half of World War II. Their fezzes were decorated on the front with  (eagle and Swastika) and the SS (skull and crossbones).

Two regiments of the Indian Army recruited from Muslim areas wore fezzes under British rule (although the turban was the nearly-universal headdress among Hindu and Muslim sepoys and sowars). A green fez was worn by the Bahawalpur Lancers of Pakistan as late as the 1960s.
==Modern use==

===In Arab countries===
In Arab countries, tarboush-making is a profession passed down from parents to children through generations. Producing the hat is tricky and requires a high degree of precision, with many stages in its production cycle. Fewer and fewer people have inherited and continue the profession. In Iraq, the Iraqi Sidara replaced the Fez after the country&#x27;s independence from the Ottoman Empire.

In the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan), the tarboush is still worn, but it is becoming rarer in recent times, and mostly worn by minstrels, or people who work in the tourist industry in historical places. It is still regarded as traditional Syrian headwear.

However in Morocco the tarboush is still worn as part of everyday attire.

=== In South Asia ===

In Hyderabad, the fez is known as the &quot;Rumi Topi&quot;, which means &quot;Roman Cap&quot; (by virtue of the Ottoman Empire being seen as the successor state of the Eastern Roman Empire). The fez was popularised by Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan of princely Hyderabad after he visited Rome. As per Himayat Ali Mirza, the great-grandson of the Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan never wore expensive clothes but used to wear Rumi Topi to camouflage his short physical stature — he was only five feet tall — and advised his son Moazzam Jah to also wear the Rumi Topi.

The fez was also a symbol of the support for the Ottoman Caliphate against the British Indian Empire during the Khilafat Movement. Later, it became associated with some leaders of the Muslim League, the political party that eventually created the country of Pakistan. The veteran Pakistani politician Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan was one of the few people in Pakistan who wore the fez until his death in 2003.

In Sri Lanka, the fez was frequently worn by the local Muslim Sri Lankan Moor population. Despite its use declining in popularity, the fez is still used in traditional marriage ceremonies. It continues to be worn by &quot;&quot; Sufi path followers. The songkok, a variation of the fez, is worn by the local Sri Lankan Malays.

=== In Southeast Asia ===
The name &quot;songkok&quot; is also used in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, while in Java, it is called &quot;kopiah&quot;; this headwear is also known widely in Indonesia as &quot;peci&quot;, although peci is somewhat different. This hat has been commonly worn in Maritime Southeast Asia since the 19th century, when it was introduced by Muslims from South Asia.

===In South Africa===
The Turkish-style fez was introduced to Cape Malays in Cape Town, South Africa, by Sheikh Abu Bakr Effendi, when he moved there from Turkey in 1863 to teach them about their religion. Prior to this, the Dutch East India Company had compelled Muslims in the Cape of Good Hope, mainly brought as slaves from what is now Indonesia, to hide their religious practice, with death as the punishment for practising their faith in public or for attempting to convert anyone.

Muslim men have continued to wear the fez there, where it is also referred to as a kofia (also spelt kofija). especially at prayer times in mosques, at weddings, and at home as a sign of respect when in the company of elderly people. It is also popular with children at madrassas (Islamic schools). However, the last traditional fez-maker in Cape Town retired in March 2022.

The &quot;Silver Fez&quot; is a competition of all-male choirs from the Cape Malay community in Cape Town, involving thousands of musicians and a wide variety of tunes. A documentary film, &quot;The Silver Fez&quot;, was made about the competition and released in 2009.

===Use by fraternal orders===

Many fraternal orders are known for wearing fezzes. 
*Shriners are often depicted wearing a red fez; the headgear became official for the Shriners in 1872.
*Members of the International Order of Alhambra wear a white fez.
*Members of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm wear a black fez.
*The Knights of Peter Claver wear a blue fez.
*Members of the Ancient Mystic Order of Samaritans wear fezzes of various colors, based upon rank.

*Members of the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World wear fezzes of various colors, based upon rank.
*The Loyal Order of Moose&#x27;s second-degree body, the Moose Legion, wear a purple fez.
*The Sons of the Desert is an international fraternal organization devoted to the lives and films of comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The group takes its name from a fictional lodge that Laurel and Hardy belonged to in the 1933 film &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot;. A special fez is worn occasionally by some members.

==In popular culture==
British comedian Tommy Cooper adopted the fez as part of his comic act while serving in Egypt during the Second World War. The hat went on to become Cooper&#x27;s hallmark and an icon of 20th century comedy.

Fans of English rugby team Saracens often wear fezzes to matches, and the club itself describes the fez as &quot;one of the most recognisable club symbols&quot;.

The pop group Madness have often worn fezzes, as seen in the music video to their 1979 song &quot;Night Boat to Cairo&quot;.

In the Disney animated series Gravity Falls, Grunkle Stan, a main character who has a persona &quot;Mr. Mystery&quot;, wears a fez which sometimes features a Shriners symbol.

In the movie &quot;Ali Baba Bujang Lapok&quot;, some characters, including Ali Baba, can be seen using a fez. They are also wearing the hat wrongly, as they put the tassel in front instead at the back.

The Eleventh Doctor (portrayed by Matt Smith) has a fascination with the fez, and wears it in some episodes of the British sci-fi television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A fez also features in one Thirteenth Doctor episode.

<text>East Boston, nicknamed Eastie, is a neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, which was annexed by the city of Boston in 1637. Neighboring communities include Winthrop, Revere, and Chelsea. It is separated from the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown and downtown Boston by Boston Harbor. The final outline of the East Boston, including Logan International Airport, was created in the 1940s by connecting five of the inner harbor islands using land fill.

East Boston has long provided homes for immigrants with Irish, Russian Jews and later, Italians. John F. Kennedy&#x27;s great-grandfather was one of many Irish people to immigrate to East Boston, and the Kennedy family lived there for some time. From 1920 to 1954, East Boston was the site of the East Boston Immigration Station, which served as the regional immigration hub for Boston and the surrounding area. A once Italian dominated community, East Boston has demographically changed to reflect a diverse population of immigrants. After the 1990s, the neighborhood witnessed growing numbers of Latin American immigrants, who have come to make up over fifty percent of the population according to the 2020 Census data.

== History ==
The landmass that is East Boston today originally comprised five islands sited east of the confluence of the Malden, Mystic, and Charles rivers, and across the harbor from the westerly city of Boston. These islands included: Noddle&#x27;s; Hog&#x27;s; Governor&#x27;s; Bird; and Apple. The town of East Boston was first developed on the largest of these, Noddle&#x27;s, a noted source of timber and grazing land, used for farming by English colonists throughout the eighteenth century.

=== Early development of the city ===
====Sumner and Noddle&#x27;s Island====
As early as 1801, William H. Sumner, who had inherited a large tract on Noddle&#x27;s Island, proposed that the federal government of the United States create a turnpike to connect Massachusett&#x27;s North Shore (along with Sumner&#x27;s property on Noddle&#x27;s) to Boston, arguing that such a road would create a valuable, direct route across Boston&#x27;s harbor, making it easier for Boston, at the time an isolated peninsula surrounded by water, to expand: &quot;There is no doubt but that the necessities of the town of Boston will some time require a connection with Noddle&#x27;s Island.&quot; When this plan was rejected in favor of a route through Chelsea (a route, not coincidentally, that left the Boston navy yard in nearby Charlestown with ocean access), Sumner moved onto other plans to improve Noddle&#x27;s value.

By 1833, Sumner, with partners Steven White and Francis J. Oliver, had bought up half of Noddle&#x27;s acreage. Together, they founded the East Boston Company, and continued to consolidate additional landholdings. By 1834, the East Boston Company had complete control over the island. The company&#x27;s purpose was to own and develop the land and call it East Boston. In anticipation of population growth, the proprietors adopted a grid street plan, the first planned neighborhood in the city of Boston. Jeffries Point, located at the southern end of the peninsula that faced Boston, was the earliest area of East Boston to be settled.

A bridge to Chelsea was built, roads were laid out, and houses were built. Much of this activity was spurred by the formation of the East Boston Lumber Company. During this period, the Boston Sugar Refinery was also founded, which was the first manufacturing establishment in East Boston. They are credited for the creation of white granulated sugar.
==== The Boston Shipyards and Donald McKay ====
By 1835, ten wharves had been built. The abundance of wharf area opened the new East Boston to further rapid expansion, and it was the shipbuilding companies that soon became East Boston&#x27;s most famous industry, and the mainstay of its economy. In 1836, as development began to totally change the former islands, East Boston was annexed to Boston.

In 1845, Donald McKay, as a sole owner, established his own shipyard on Border Street. His ships included the &quot;Flying Cloud&quot; (1851), which made two 89-day passages from New York to San Francisco and the &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; (1852), which posted the fastest speed ever by a sailing ship (22 knots) in 1854.

In the 1840s and 1850s, the principal shipbuilders besides McKay included Paul Curtis and Samuel Hall. In addition, Sylvanus Smith became a noted shipbuilder in East Boston.

=== Connections to the mainland ===
In the 1830s, the largest problem keeping East Boston from thriving was transportation. The East Boston Company believed the neighborhood could not become a valuable asset until people had a way to reach the area from the Boston mainland. As a temporary solution, they set up a paddle steamer to carry 15 people at a time from Boston Proper to the neighborhood. It was used primarily for occasional visits from public officials and laborers. Though they did not have the ridership to support additional boats, the company purchased the Tom Thumb steamboat.

The steam railroad system was still in its infancy at this point, and the East Boston Company was approached by an inventor of a new type of rail system, the suspension railway. This system was one of the earliest suspended railroads to be built. The railroad cars were propelled by a steam engine hanging from a suspended track. Henry Sargent, the inventor, stated &quot;that his invention would make the Island a center of attraction to many people.&quot; The Company allowed it to be built on its land and it was in use for nine days in 1834, then closed citing lack of ridership.

In the mid-1830s, the Company made several investments to further East Boston&#x27;s development. They continued attempts to get the Eastern Railroad to come to East Boston. The &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;East Boston&quot; ferries began service from Lewis Wharf on the mainland to East Boston.

The ferry service from Noddle&#x27;s Island was replaced in 1904 by the streetcar tunnel that became the MBTA Blue Line, the first underwater tunnel in North America.

=== Boston&#x27;s &quot;Ellis Island&quot; ===
Since the mid-19th century, the community served as a foothold for immigrants to the United States: Irish and Canadians came first, followed by Russian Jews and Italians, then Southeast Asians, and, more recently, an influx from Central and South American countries. The Orient Heights section of East Boston was the first area in Massachusetts to which Italians immigrated in the 1860s and 1870s, and today the heart of the Italian community remains in East Boston. The Madonna Shrine, which is the national headquarters of the Don Orione order, sits on top of the Heights and is a replica of the original religious structure in Rome. In the 1880s, the Immigrants House operated in East Boston to help immigrants during their arrivals with economic support and social services. The building in which the Immigrants House operated was later named Landfall and served as the first senior citizen housing in the community.
During World War I, areas of East Boston served as an internment camp for Germans taken off of ships. Period images show small unfenced buildings and tiny gardens built by the internees, leading right up to the water&#x27;s edge. In 1919, moves were undertaken to formalize these facilities. Originally officials planned to use one of the Harbor Islands to replace their rented quarters on Long Wharf, but this plan was abandoned for a site on Marginal Street, directly on the East Boston wharves. Construction began in late 1919 on the East Boston Immigration Station, which served as Boston&#x27;s first purpose-built immigration station. The East Boston Immigration Station operated from 1920 to 1954 as the region&#x27;s immigration hub. In 2011, the Immigration Station was torn down.

Unlike Ellis Island in New York, inspectors at the East Boston station processed immigrants at steamship docks, only transferring to the immigration station problem cases who had issues with their paperwork or required a secondary interview. Opposite the station, steps leading to East Boston were called the &#x27;Golden Stairs&#x27; &quot;because they represented the final climb to golden opportunity in America for countless Europeans.&quot; The station operated from 1920 to 1954 as the region&#x27;s immigration hub.
The population of East Boston, which was recorded as a mere thousand in 1837, exploded to a high of just over 64,000, according to the 1925 census. The sudden rise is attributed to the immigrants who came from Southern Italy. Today, the neighborhood is home to over 40,000 inhabitants, with a median income per household of around $46,000.

=== Kennedy family ===
The Kennedy Family lived on Meridian Street in what is now a small home wedged between a Hispanic market and hardware store, approaching the Meridian Street branch of the Boston Public Library. The family later moved to a larger home on Monmouth Street. P. J. Kennedy&#x27;s success enabled him to purchase a home for his son, Joseph, and another for his two daughters at Jeffries Point.

In 1954, John F. Kennedy famously paraded through East Boston with his wife, Jackie, in anticipation for his campaign to run for United States Senate, to secure votes from the neighborhood. In a famous photograph, Kennedy is shown walking down Chelsea Street heading towards Maverick Square, waving to the crowd in front of Santarpio&#x27;s Pizza.

On numerous occasions throughout his career in the United States Senate, Senator Ted Kennedy mentioned that his family&#x27;s roots are embedded in East Boston.

=== Historic Demographics ===
East Boston&#x27;s population is ethnically diverse, reflecting the immigrants from around the world who moved there. Since the early 1900s, immigrants have been a part of the East Boston community. First Irish and Canadians, then Russian Jews and Italians, Southeast Asians, and finally Latinos. In 2011, East Boston was estimated to have 41,128 residents living in 14,832 housing units.

Hispanic/Latino people speaking Spanish or Portuguese are the largest language groupings (can be of any race and from more than 20 countries), making up 54.4% of the population, followed by non-Hispanic white (35.5%). Other races include Asian (4.4%), black or African American (2.9%), biracial or multiracial individuals (1.9%), and other races (0.9%). The median household income for an individual in East Boston was $45,849, while the median income for a family was $47,198.

According to 2020 Census Data, analyzed by the Boston Planning &amp; Development Agency, East Boston shared the highest population of Hispanic or Latinos in Boston with 50.4% of the neighborhood. East Boston&#x27;s total population is 43,066 with half of the population identifying as Hispanic or Latino and the second largest demographic group being White at 36.6%. The demographics for Hispanic or Latino decreased from 2010 when the group made up 52.9% of the population. In September 2022, Mayor Michelle Wu questioned the 2020 Census data for the whole city, sharing concerns over uncounted individuals, citing the pandemic as a factor for low census turnout, and expressing her belief that Boston&#x27;s total numbers needed to be adjusted higher.
=== Race and ancestry ===
According to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, the largest ancestry groups in ZIP Code 02128 are:
=== Education ===
==== Public schools ====
Boston Public Schools operates numerous schools in East Boston. BPS assigns students based on student preference and priorities of students in various zones. Due to the geography of East Boston, every child in the neighborhood is guaranteed a seat at a school in East Boston. The district instructs parents wanting to send their children to East Boston schools to place East Boston campuses on their school assignment priority lists higher than non-neighborhood campus.

The East Boston Early Childhood Center is a district K0–1 school in East Boston. The Dante Alighieri Montessori School is a district K0-6 school. District elementary schools include Samuel Adams, Manassah E. Bradley, Curtis Guild, Patrick J. Kennedy, Hugh R. O&#x27;Donnell, and James Otis. The Mario Umana Academy and Donald McKay K-8 School are the two district K–8 schools in East Boston. East Boston has two high schools in their district; East Boston High School and Excel Academy Charter High School, which was founded in 2015. Excel Academy Charter School also has two charter middle schools located on Moore St. and Bremen St. in East Boston.


===== Private schools =====
In spring 1892, a school named after Fr. James Fitton was dedicated on the Holy Redeemer site. In 1974, a school merger occurred, producing the current East Boston Central Catholic School. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston operates East Boston Central Catholic School on the Most Holy Redeemer Parish site. It is a K1–8 private school in East Boston. The school is managed by a board from the Our Lady of the Assumption, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Most Holy Redeemer and Sacred Heart parishes.

In Spring 2008, the Archdiocese ordered the closure of St. Mary, Star of the Sea School, a K–8 school in East Boston. The parish attached to the school had closed three years prior to the closure of the school.

Until it closed in 2007, Savio Preparatory High School was a private, coeducational high school in East Boston.

==== Public libraries ====
The first public branch library in the United States was established in East Boston in 1870. Boston Public Library currently has one location in East Boston, at 365 Bremen Street in the Bremen Street Park. This branch opened in November 2013. The old branches at 276 Meridian Street and 18 Barnes Avenue were closed in 2013, shortly before the current branch opened.

=== Community centers and resources ===
East Boston has various non-profits that work to address issues the community face like immigration, tenant&#x27;s rights, youth engagement, environmental justice, housing, and more. Such organizations are Neighborhood of Affordable Housing (NOAH), East Boston Main Streets, East Boston Social Center, YMCA, Harbor Arts, Piers Park Sailing Center, and more.

The City of Boston runs two community centers in East Boston: Orient Heights Community Center (now called The Martin Pino Community Center) and Paris Street Community Center. These Centers are an initiative of a citywide organization called Boston Center for Youth and Families. The Centers aim to assist local youth with after-school programming.

=== Open space ===
In the early 1990s, East Boston had the least open space of any Boston neighborhood, except Chinatown. However, the city of Boston, and East Boston in particular, has undergone several major initiatives to increase open space in Boston. One such initiative is called Urban Wilds. Unveiled in 2016, it focuses on protecting &quot;urban wilds&quot; in Boston&#x27;s neighborhoods. The city has identified four sites in Boston which it is targeting to improve coastal habitats, rejuvenate fish populations, restore soil, and use for flood control and water quality improvement purposes.

The city&#x27;s creation of the East Boston Greenway, which stretches from the wharfs at Maverick Square to the Bayswater Urban Wild, has also been a major addition to the neighborhood&#x27;s green space. In 2019, the East Boston Greenway was renamed the Mary Ellen Welch Greenway, honoring Mary Ellen Welch, a well-known community activist. She was one of the first individuals who supported the greenway creation and challenged Massport for their responsibility for noise pollution from the airport.

Today, East Boston has 230 acres of protected open space, and 371 acres of total open space. This averages out to 5.98 acres of protected space per thousand individuals. This is less than the citywide average of 7.43 acres per thousand people.

As of June 2022, East Boston had the lowest tree canopy cover in the city with only 7% coverage compared to the City&#x27;s 27% total coverage. The low tree coverage has been cited as an additional environmental burden by many activists that deprives the community of benefits like lower air and noise pollution. A youth group from Neighborhood of Affordable Housing began working in 2017 to advocate for greater tree cover in the community and enhance efforts on addressing the lack of cover. In September 2022, Mayor Michelle Wu announced increased efforts from her administration to address low tree coverage in the whole city such as adding more jobs and planting more trees.

=== Housing ===
Until 2011, there were a total of 16,090 housing units in East Boston. Of these, 14,832 were occupied and 1,258 were vacant. Out of the 14,832 occupied units, 4,248 were owner-occupied and 10,584 were renter-occupied. The median gross rent was $1,092.

Homelessness is an issue in the shelters and on the streets of East Boston. To help families transition out of East Boston&#x27;s homeless shelter, the City of Boston, Crossroads Family Shelter, and the East Boston Community Development Corporation joined together in 2015 create subsidized housing on Havre Street. There are seven new affordable units planned.

== East Boston Celebrations ==
East Boston has two annual recurring celebrations take place every summer. Eastie Week takes place for two weeks every July in collaboration between Boston Harbor Now and local partner organizations. During the celebrations, the organizations offer free and affordable events for families in East Boston. Eastie Pride Day is a long-standing celebration founded by former City Councilor Sal LaMattina that takes place at Piers Park. The celebration is open and free to the public and offers food, music, kids games, and community resources.

== Transportation ==

Transportation has long played a role in the shaping of East Boston. Clipper ships were built at the shipyard owned by Donald McKay in the mid-19th century. A subway tunnel connecting the neighborhood to the rest of the city opened in 1904 and was the first undersea tunnel of its kind in the United States. Rows of houses were torn down to build the Sumner Tunnel in 1934 and the Callahan Tunnel in 1961, directly connecting automobile traffic from downtown Boston. In the early 1920s, an airfield was built, and eventually it was expanded to become Logan International Airport. The eastern terminus of Interstate 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) has been at Route 1A next to Logan Airport since 2003, and the newer Ted Williams Tunnel (1995) links I-90 from East Boston to the rest of the city.

=== Logan International Airport ===
Logan Airport, New England&#x27;s primary international airport and 48th busiest in the world, resides mainly in East Boston (though part of the airfield itself lies in Winthrop). There has been continual controversy surrounding Logan, as constant conflict with the Massachusetts Port Authority has been a source of bitterness among some local residents since its inception. One expansion of the Airport resulted in the loss of Wood Island Park, a green space designed by the noted landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The expansion of Logan Airport in the late 1960s and early 1970s displaced families along Neptune Road, which is now used for warehouses and rental car property. The airport has since implemented four &quot;airport edge buffers,&quot; which include parks and greenery to appease residents.

The neighborhood is easily accessible to downtown Boston via the MBTA Blue Line, which stops at Maverick, Airport, Wood Island, Orient Heights, and Suffolk Downs in the East Boston area. Massport provides free shuttle buses from the Airport MBTA station to all Logan Airport terminals and the Rental Car Center. The East Boston Greenway, a shared use path and park along a former rail line, connects to the Airport station.

<text>The Faculty of Science () at the University of Copenhagen houses 12 departments, including the Natural History Museum of Denmark. The faculty also encompasses several national and international research centres, and has a number of field stations in Denmark and Greenland, among them the university&#x27;s Arctic Station in central West Greenland. The faculty&#x27;s administration is housed at the university&#x27;s Frederiksberg Campus.

The faculty offers three-year Bachelor of Science (BS), two-year Master of Science (MS) and three-year Ph.D. degree programmes. There are two main areas of study programmes. One is the mathematical-physical-chemical subject group, which includes mathematics, computer science, actuarial science, mathematical economy, statistics, physics, astronomy, geophysics, meteorology, biophysics, chemistry, environmental chemistry, food science, biochemistry and nano-science. The other is the natural history-geography group, which includes biology, physical education, sports science, geology, geography, geo-informatics, geology-geophysics and bio-informatics. The University was co-founder of the Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) which was established in 2001.

==History==
On January 1, 2004, the Botanical Institute and Zoological Institute merged into the Department of Biology, while the four museums Botanical Garden, Botanical Museum and Library, Geological Museum and Zoological Museum
merged as Natural History Museum of Denmark.

In January 2005, the August Krogh Institute and the Department of Molecular Biology merged to form the Department of Molecular Biology and Physiology. Three years later it was merged into the Department of Biology.

In January 2007, the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University was merged into the University of Copenhagen and was renamed as the Faculty of Life Sciences. Five years later it was split up, with the veterinary part merging into the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences and the rest merging into the Faculty of Science.

== Seal ==
The seal of the faculty contains the following text

which is written in a circle around a stylized rendering of a hafnium atom. Hafnium was discovered at the Faculty in 1923 by Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy, and the name of the element is derived from &quot;Hafnia&quot; which is the Latin name for Copenhagen.

== Departments ==
The faculty&#x27;s research and teaching takes place across 12 departments. Some departments house specialized sections and laboratories.

<text>There are 44 universities in Australia out of which 39 are public universities and 5 private universities. The Commonwealth Higher Education Support Act 2003 sets out three groups of Australian higher education providers: universities, other self-accrediting higher education institutions and state and territory accredited higher education institutions.

For admissions to universities, those students who have completed Australian state curricula are granted a state-specific Australian Tertiary Admission Rank. All Australian universities use the ATAR based &quot;selection rank&quot; as one of their methods of admission; universities also use past study, work experience and other considerations in granting admission. The ATAR provides an indication of the overall position of the student in relation to the student body for that year across the state. The ATAR is used by state-specific centralised admission centres for admission into university. The following bodies allocate ATAR based selection ranks and admission for the tertiary institutions in their respective states:
* Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, with a separate website for Tasmania
* South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre (SATAC) in South Australia and the Northern Territory
* Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC) in Victoria
* Tertiary Institutions Service Centre (TISC) in Western Australia
* Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre (QTAC) in Queensland
For International Baccalaureate (IB) Australian students (Australian citizens) as well as the international students in Australia, the &quot;Australasian Conference of Tertiary Admission Centres&quot; (ACTAC) calculates an Australia-wide ATAR-like national rank called &quot;Combined rank which combines results from across all states, thus enabling IB students to &quot;apply in any Australian state or territory with confidence about how their results compare to their peers who have completed state curricula and received an ATAR&quot;, also &quot;when completing your final year of schooling, ensure that you provide permission via your school for your IB results to be released to Australian tertiary admissions centres. As long as you identify yourself as an IB student and provide your IB candidate number when applying for courses, your IB scores and subject results will be received electronically and automatically converted for the purposes of selection and meeting prerequisites.&quot;

== Universities in Australia ==
In addition to the following universities, the Australian campus of Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s H. John Heinz III College operated in the city of Adelaide in South Australia between 2006 and 2022. University College London also operated an Australian campus in Adelaide between 2009 and 2017. The newest Australian institution to receive university status is the Australian University of Theology in 2025. 

==National university groups==
* Australian-European Network – a network of 5 Australian universities who cooperate with 31 European universities on student exchange programs.
* Australian Technology Network – technology-focused Australian universities that mostly originated as institutes of technology.
* Group of Eight – research intensive high-ranking Australian universities, similar to Russell Group in the United Kingdom.
* Innovative Research Universities – a coalition of Australian universities with focus on higher education advocacy and research.
* Red Brick Universities – the University of New South Wales, Monash University and the Australian National University
* Regional Universities Network – a group of regional, distance education and multi-campus university networks.
* Open Universities Australia – a group of universities that offer distance education courses as part of a common platform.
* Sandstone Universities – an informal group of the oldest universities in each Australian state with colonial-era sandstone buildings.
* Verdant universities – an informal group of Australian universities founded in the 1960s and 70s, often with nature reserves or vegetation
* NUW Alliance – the University of Newcastle, the University of New South Wales and the University of Wollongong

<text>This is a list of universities in Belgium. In Belgium, which is a federal state, the constitution attributes legislative power over higher education to the Communities.
