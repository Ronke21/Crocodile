<doc id="329608" wikidata="Q3565127" url="?curid=329608" title="Telephone numbers in Greece">
<text>This is a list of dialing codes in Greece. The first digit represents the type of service. 1 is used for short codes, 2 for geographical numbers (3 and 4 are reserved for that purpose too), 5 is used for inter-network routing purposes (non-dialable codes) and VPNs, 6 for mobile services, 7 is reserved for universal access numbers (not active), 8 for reduced-fee services (like 800 toll-free, 801 local call, 89 dial-up and data services), 9 is used for premium rate services (901 for general purpose and 909 for adult-only services). All dialable numbers are ten digits, except for short codes (3–5 digits in the 1 range), 807-XXXX (seven digits) used for calling card access codes, and numbers in the 5 range, used for routing purposes and not dialable by end-subscribers.

==Overview==
Geographical area codes start with the digit 2. There are currently two-, three-, and four-digit area codes. The only two-digit area code is 21 for the Athens Metropolitan area; three-digit codes are used for the cities Thessaloniki, Patras, Larissa, Heraklion, Kavala, and Tripoli. The rest of the codes are four-digit codes.

Generally speaking, the second digit of a geographical area code signifies a broader geographical area of Greece. That is how area codes are sorted in this article.

Two-digit codes are used with eight-digit subscriber numbers, three-digit codes with seven-digit numbers, and four-digit codes with six-digit numbers, so the full telephone number is always ten digits.

Subscriber numbers in most areas start with 0. That is the digit that was inserted between the area code and the subscriber number to form the new ten-digit numbering plan back in 2002. Thus, many Greeks erroneously think that the area codes include this leading 0. For example, they think that Athens&#x27;s area code is 210 while, actually, Athens&#x27;s area code is 21, with 0 being the first digit of the subscriber number.

Subscriber numbers starting with 0 are assigned to the former monopoly OTE. In bigger cities like Athens and Thessaloniki, subscriber numbers starting with digits other than 0 are becoming more and more common, especially amongst business subscribers. In this case, many people think that the area code is different. For example, a subscriber number in Athens might start with 211, with people thinking that 211 is a distinct area code from 210 while, in reality, both numbers are in the 21 area code and the third digit of the number belongs to the subscriber number.

The international call prefix depends on the country from which you are calling, for example, 00 for most European countries and 011 from North America.

In 2001-2002, Greece moved to a closed ten-digit numbering scheme in two stages, with the result that subscribers&#x27; numbers changed twice. For example, before the change, a number in Athens would have been dialed as follows:

In 2001, a &#x27;0&#x27; was added after the area code, which was incorporated into the subscriber&#x27;s number:

Finally, in 2002, the leading &#x27;0&#x27; was changed to a &#x27;2&#x27; (for geographic numbers) :

For mobile phone numbers, the leading &#x27;0&#x27; was changed to a &#x27;6&#x27;.

Note that because of number portability, for both geographical and non-geographical (mobile, toll-free, premium rate) numbers, one cannot be sure about the operator that a number belongs to. All geographical codes (21x, 231x) end in a number from 0 to 6 (210 or 212 for Athens, 2310 or 2312 for Thessaloniki). Numbers whose code ends in &quot;0&quot; &quot;are&quot; or &quot;were originally&quot; operated by OTE. The same applies to mobile phones: All mobile codes (69x) end in 0,3,4,5,7,8 or 9 (690, 698). Mobile code &quot;696&quot; is assigned to OTE pagers. Numbers starting with 690 and 693 were &quot;originally&quot; assigned to WIND, with 694 and 695 to Vodafone, with 697 and 698 to Cosmote and with 699 to Q-Telecom until 2007 when it merged with WIND.

<text>Radio Nova is a non-commercially run student radio station situated and broadcasting in Oslo, Norway, at FM 99.3. The station is run by a team of volunteer journalists and technicians.

The station went on-air for the first time on 16 March 1982, as Norway&#x27;s first non-Christian, local radio station.

, the station broadcasts 60 hours a week between 40 programs. In the course of a week there is a range of different programmes; debates, programs that deal with film, the sciences, literature, music, culture and social questions.

Together with the rest of Norway&#x27;s student radio stations, Radio Nova introduced a shared endeavor to further the cause of independent/alternative music: a national student radio play-list. The student stations in the three biggest university towns (Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim) have in cooperation put together the list, but with the expectation it will be played by smaller student stations throughout the country.

<doc id="329611" wikidata="Q1278452" url="?curid=329611" title="Polyptych">
<text>A polyptych ( ; Greek: &quot;poly-&quot; &quot;many&quot; and &quot;ptychē&quot; &quot;fold&quot;) is a work of art (usually a panel painting) which is divided into sections, or panels. Some definitions restrict &quot;polyptych&quot; to works with more than three sections: a diptych is a two-part work of art; a triptych is a three-part work; a &quot;tetraptych&quot; or &quot;quadriptych&quot; has four parts. The great majority of historical examples are paintings with religious subjects, but in the 20th century the format became popular again for portraits and other subjects, in painting, photography, and other media.

Historically, polyptychs were panel paintings that typically displayed one &quot;central&quot; or &quot;main&quot; panel that was usually the largest; the other panels are called &quot;side&quot; panels, or if hinged, &quot;wings&quot;. Folding forms were much more common north of the Alps. Sometimes, as evident in the Ghent Altarpiece and Isenheim Altarpiece, the hinged panels can be varied in arrangement to show different &quot;views&quot; or &quot;openings&quot; in the piece, because the wing panels are painted with images on both sides. The wings were usually kept folded shut, showing the &quot;closed&quot; view, except on Sundays or feast-days, or if visitors paid the sacristan for a sight of the &quot;open&quot; view. The upper panels often depict static scenes, while the lower register, the predella, often depict small narrative scenes.
Large polyptychs were most commonly created as altarpieces in churches and cathedrals, although smaller diptychs and triptychs could be personal works for the rich, for example the royal Wilton Diptych, a very personal work made for Richard II of England. They had the advantage that they could be folded up to make them more secure from damage during travel. Another form was the carved ivory polyptych, most often religious, but with some secular subjects (these were more common on ivory boxes or mirrors).

When the altarpieces later came out of use, for a variety of reasons, they were often broken up and individual panels dispersed into the art trade, to be treated as easel paintings. Panels with paintings on both sides were often carefully sawn apart, to give two one-sided panels. Finding and reconstructing the parts of dispersed polyptychs has been the subject of much research in art history since the 19th century. 

In medieval history, a different sense of the word is the polyptych meaning a document detailing the lands that a noble owned. Many also featured names of the peasants that lived there, allowing for historians to track the history of peasant families. The 9th-century monastic Polyptych of Irminon is an example.

== History and development ==
Whilst the polyptych originated as a form of sacred art, as a term to describe art in general, it can be seen to encompass any work of art constituted by multiple pieces of art such as sculpture, photography, or video and text-based art forms.

In European Renaissance painting, a polyptych is often seen in a devotional setting, often found as altarpieces. Whilst the precise origins of polyptychal art is uncertain, the earliest examples have been described as coming from Italy in the early 14th century. The development of Church art in the 13th century saw a fusing of the Byzantine iconostasis with the Gothic architectural style. These twin influences resulted in something resembling the Renaissance polyptych that is recognisable today. The work of Duccio di Buoninsegna, who was active in Siena in the early-to-mid 14th century offers early examples of the polyptych form, with the early Italo-Byzantine influences. 
By the Renaissance, both large altarpiece polyptychs and smaller domestic ones were falling out of fashion, partly because artists preferred to paint single scenes with a unified background, but Rubens still painted some very large winged altarpieces in the early 17th century, such as his &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; triptych, of 1612–1614, in Antwerp Cathedral, which also has his &quot;Raising of the Cross&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot; triptychs, of similar date. By this time this format was unusual.

Sean Scully describes a number of his paintings as triptychs, such as the paintings &quot;Demo Logic Red&quot; and &quot;To Be With&quot;.

<doc id="329612" wikidata="Q567834" url="?curid=329612" title="HMS Bellerophon (1786)">
<text>HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, known to sailors as the &quot;Billy Ruffian&quot;, was a ship of the line of the Royal Navy. A third-rate of 74 guns, she was launched in 1786. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. She fought in three fleet actions: the Glorious First of June (1794), the Battle of the Nile (1798) and the Battle of Trafalgar (1805). While the ship was on blockade duty in 1815, Napoleon boarded &quot;Bellerophon&quot; so he could surrender to the ship&#x27;s captain, ending 22 years of almost continuous war between Britain and France.

Built at Frindsbury, near Rochester in Kent, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was initially laid up in ordinary, briefly being commissioned during the Spanish and Russian Armaments. She entered service with the Channel Fleet on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792, and took part in the Glorious First of June in 1794, the first major fleet action of the wars. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; narrowly escaped being captured by the French in 1795, when her squadron was nearly overrun by a more powerful French fleet at the First Battle of Groix, but the bold actions of the squadron&#x27;s commander, Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis, caused the French to retreat. She played a minor role in efforts to intercept a French invasion force bound for Ireland in 1797, and then joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Sir John Jervis. Detached to reinforce Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson&#x27;s fleet in 1798, she took part in the decisive defeat of a French fleet at the Battle of the Nile, where she suffered severe damage and lost several officers while engaging the much larger French flagship &quot;Orient&quot;. She returned to England before being sent to the West Indies, where she spent the Peace of Amiens (1802–03) on cruises and convoy escort duty between the Caribbean and North America.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; returned to European waters with the resumption of the wars with France, joining a fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood blockading Cadiz. The reinforced fleet, by then commanded by Horatio Nelson, engaged the combined Franco-Spanish fleet when it emerged from port. At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October &quot;Bellerophon&quot; fought a bitter engagement against Spanish and French ships, sustaining heavy casualties including the death of her captain, John Cooke. Following the battle, she escorted Nelson&#x27;s body back to England. After repairs, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was employed blockading the enemy fleets in the Channel and the North Sea. She plied the waters of the Baltic Sea in 1809, making attacks on Russian shipping, and by 1810 was off the French coast again, blockading their ports. She went out to North America as a convoy escort between 1813 and 1814, and in 1815 was assigned to blockade the French Atlantic port of Rochefort. In July 1815, defeated at Waterloo and finding escape to North America barred by the blockading &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, Napoleon came aboard &quot;the ship that had dogged his steps for twenty years&quot; (according to maritime historian David Cordingly) to finally surrender to the British. It was &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s last seagoing service. She was paid off and converted to a prison ship in 1815, and was renamed &quot;Captivity&quot; in 1824 to free the name for another ship. Moved to Plymouth in 1826, she continued in service until 1834, when the last convicts left. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1836; she was subsequently broken up for scrap.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s long and distinguished career has been recorded in literature and folk songs.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bellerophon&quot; was ordered from the commercial shipbuilder Edward Greaves and Company, of Frindsbury in Kent, on 11 January 1782 to a modified design originally developed by Surveyor of the Navy Sir Thomas Slade. She was one of ten ships built to the modified design, originally developed by Slade in 1758 and used to build two ships, and . The design was resurrected and slightly altered in 1774, and approved by the Admiralty on 25 August that year. The keel was laid down at Frindsbury in May 1782. Measuring on the gundeck and on the keel, she had a beam of , measured 1,612 tons burthen and mounted 74 guns. This armament consisted of twenty-eight 32-pounder guns on her lower gundeck, twenty-eight 18-pounder guns on the upper gundeck, fourteen 9-pounder guns on the quarterdeck and four 9-pounder guns on the forecastle.

The ship was named &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, a decision that had been arrived at by at least April 1782, when it was entered into the minutes of the Surveyor&#x27;s Office. The First Lord of the Admiralty at the time, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, had apparently selected the name from Lemprière&#x27;s Classical Dictionary, which he kept on his desk. The recently ordered 74-gun ship was thereafter to be named after the Greek warrior Bellerophon who rode the winged horse Pegasus and slew the monster Chimera. The pronunciation proved difficult for the ordinary sailors of the period, and she was widely known by variants, most commonly &quot;Billy Ruffian&quot; or &quot;Billy Ruff&#x27;n&quot;, although &quot;Belly Ruff One&quot; appears in a satirical 1810 print by Thomas Rowlandson, and &quot;Bellyruffron&quot; in the novel &quot;Poor Jack&quot; by Frederick Marryat. She was decorated with a figurehead of Bellerophon.

By the time &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was launched, there was no pressing need for new warships. The signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 brought the American War of Independence to an end while &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was still under construction. Though Greaves had been contracted to have her ready for launching by April 1784, she spent another two years on the slipway, probably because the Navy Board ordered construction work to be delayed to allow her timber to be seasoned, a luxury available now that there were no pressing military needs. When the launch came, it was delayed several times, finally taking place during a period of heavy autumn storms in October 1786. She was launched with little ceremony on 7 October 1786, by Commissioner Charles Proby, of Chatham Dockyard. She was then towed across the River Medway and anchored off Chatham Dockyard. She was taken into the dry dock there on 7 March 1787, where her hull was fitted with copper sheathing, and she was fitted for the Ordinary. Her final costs came to £30,232.14.4d paid to Greaves for building her, and a further £8,376.15.2d spent on fitting her for service.

Laid up at Chatham during the years of peace, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was not commissioned until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the moorings on 16 August, and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; made her way down the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.
From the Nore, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; proceeded to the Downs and joined the fleet stationed there. She spent three weeks in the roadstead, exercising her guns, before moving to Spithead. The diplomatic crisis with Spain had largely abated by October 1790, and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was sent to Sheerness in late November. She remained in commission, still under Pasley, during the Russian Armament in 1791, but when this period of tension also passed without breaking into open war, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was sent back to Chatham and paid off there on 9 September 1791.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was commissioned in March 1793, under her former captain, Thomas Pasley. Pasley fitted her for sea and sailed to join the Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe. The Channel Fleet sailed on 14 July, with orders to patrol off Brest in the hope of intercepting and destroying the French fleet based there. While south-west of the Scilly Isles on 18 July, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; collided with in gale-force winds. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; lost her bowsprit, foremast and main topmast, and had her figurehead and cutwater smashed, which necessitated putting into Plymouth for repairs.

After being repaired, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; rejoined the Channel Fleet, which by now was patrolling the Western Approaches. She developed a reputation for speed during these duties, and was given the nickname of &quot;The Flying Bellerophon&quot;. In September 1793 Howe assigned her to a flying squadron made up of the fastest ships of the line, and gave Pasley command of the squadron, with the temporary rank of commodore.

On 27 November 1793, the ships of Pasley&#x27;s squadron captured the French corvette &quot;Blonde&quot;. At the time of her capture &quot;Blonde&quot; was armed with 28 guns and had a crew of 210 men under the command of Citizen Gueria. A subsequent prize money notice listed the vessels that shared in the proceeds as &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, , , , and .

With Pasley now responsible for a squadron, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; received a new commander in January 1794, Captain William Johnstone Hope, with Commodore Pasley continuing to fly his broad pennant aboard her. For the next five months the Channel Fleet patrolled off Ushant and the Brittany coast.

===Glorious First of June===

The Channel Fleet played an important role in the closing stages of the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, when Howe moved out into the Atlantic in the hope of intercepting an approaching French convoy under Admiral Pierre Jean Van Stabel. The main French battlefleet was also known to be at sea, under Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse. Howe sent Pasley, recently promoted to rear-admiral, and his flying squadron, consisting of &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and the 74-gun ships , and , ahead to scout for French forces. At 6 am on 28 May the attached frigate signalled &quot;Bellerophon&quot; to report a sighting of a strange fleet. Pasley took the squadron south-east to investigate, coming in sight of a large fleet at 9 am, and counting thirty-three ships, of which at least twenty-three appeared to be ships of the line. They were confirmed as French by noon, and Pasley signalled this news back to Howe. Howe ordered a pursuit, and by evening the leading British ships, with Pasley&#x27;s flying squadron forming the van, came in contact with the rear-most French. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was the first ship to come into action, when the 110-gun &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot; dropped back to block her approach. Pasley tacked to close the French ship and began exchanging broadsides. The heavy fire of the larger French ship caused considerable damage, particularly to &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s main topmast, and she fought alone until the remainder of the flying squadron and two ships from the main fleet, and , arrived to assist her. The damaged &quot;Bellerophon&quot; then drifted clear of the action, and as night fell Howe signalled for the fleet to reform in line ahead and wait for morning before resuming the engagement.

The action resumed the following morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; followed Howe&#x27;s flagship, the 100-gun , and sustained some damage from French fire. Howe isolated several French ships in the rear and pounded them with broadsides, but Villaret de Joyeuse was able to bring his van about to rescue them, and the two fleets parted again at night to reform their battle lines and repair damage. Poor weather on 30 May and 31 May prevented the fleets from making contact, but the following day, 1 June, Howe was able to bring about a decisive action, later known as the Glorious First of June. The British approached in line abreast, with &quot;Bellerophon&quot; at the end of the line. As they approached, the ships were heavily cannonaded by the French. Pasley was hit in the leg by a cannonball as he stood on the quarterdeck, with Midshipman Matthew Flinders reporting that &quot;our brave admiral lost his leg by an 18-pounder shot which came in through the barricadoes of the quarter-deck – it was in the heat of the action.&quot; When two seamen expressed their sorrow, Pasley replied &quot;Thank you, but never mind my leg: take care of my flag.&quot; He was taken below where the shattered leg was amputated. Captain Hope kept the ship in the engagement, pounding the 74-gun &quot;Éole&quot; until the French ship was forced out of the line. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had by then lost all three topmasts, and her mainsail and lower shrouds had been cut to pieces. Hope then signalled the frigate to tow &quot;Bellerophon&quot; clear of the action. Despite being under heavy fire during the battle, &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s casualties were comparatively light, amounting to four men killed and between twenty-seven and thirty wounded.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; returned with the fleet to England after the battle, where the wounded Pasley left the ship. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for repairs, and then resumed her patrols in the Western Approaches with the Channel Fleet. Captain Hope was superseded in late November, and on 1 December 1794 &quot;Bellerophon&quot; received a new commander, Captain James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun.

===Cornwallis&#x27;s Retreat===
&quot;Bellerophon&quot; returned to sea in May 1795 after three months anchored in the Solent. She had been at Spithead on 1 May, when the 98-gun caught fire and blew up, with &quot;Bellerophon&quot; rescuing twelve men. Still with the Channel Fleet, she joined a squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis which was patrolling off Ushant. The squadron had arrived on station on 7 June, and the following day captured a convoy of eight French merchants off Belle Île. The squadron remained in the area until 16 June, when a lookout on &quot;Bellerophon&quot; spotted a large fleet to the east-south-east. This was the Brest fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, two frigates, two brigs and a cutter, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse. Heavily outnumbered, Cornwallis ordered a retreat, but &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and sailed unusually slowly and he found himself being steadily overhauled by the French. Keeping his ships together, Cornwallis ordered &quot;Bellerophon&quot; to take up position at the head of his line, later explaining that &quot;The Bellerophon I was glad to keep in some measure as a reserve, having reason at first to suppose there would be full occasion for the utmost exertions of us all ... I considered that ship a treasure in store, having heard of her former accomplishments, and observing the spirit manifested by all on board when she passed me, joined to the zeal and activity shewed by Lord Cranstoun during the whole cruize.&quot;

After a full day of pursuit, the leading French ships made an attempt to cut off , trailing in the British rear. Cornwallis dropped back to support &quot;Mars&quot;, while Captain Robert Stopford of HMS &quot;Phaeton&quot; began making signals implying a British fleet was in sight. When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis&#x27;s actions meant that a British fleet was approaching to support him, and called off the pursuit. There was no British fleet in the vicinity; the topsails were those of a convoy of British merchantmen.

===Irish waters===
&quot;Bellerophon&quot; returned to England in June, before departing to patrol the Western Approaches until September. She entered Portsmouth Dockyard again in October and underwent a refit costing £8,103. She resumed patrol and blockade duty in the Western Approaches in January 1796, at first under Cranstoun, but from April effectively under the acting-captaincy of Lieutenant John Loring. Cranstoun&#x27;s replacement, Captain Henry D&#x27;Esterre Darby, arrived to take command in September. Blockade duty continued until early January 1797, when news reached the fleet that a French expedition had appeared off Ireland. Caught off guard, the Admiralty ordered &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and a number of other ships to patrol off Bantry Bay. By then the French expedition had been dispersed by bad weather, and after three weeks on patrol, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; put into Cork where she rendezvoused with the Irish squadron under Admiral Robert Kingsmill. Shortly after her return to Spithead in early March, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was given new orders by the Admiralty. She sailed on 17 March, bound for Cadiz to join Sir John Jervis&#x27;s Mediterranean Fleet blockading the port.

===Mediterranean duties===

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; rendezvoused with Jervis&#x27;s fleet in the Bay of Cadiz on 30 May 1797. Three days later she was visited for the only time by Horatio Nelson, then a rear-admiral and in command of the inshore squadron of the blockading fleet. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was with the fleet in the Bay of Cadiz until October, when Jervis took it to sea to patrol between Cape Trafalgar and Cape St. Vincent. These duties lasted until late May 1798, when &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was assigned to a detached squadron under Captain Thomas Troubridge and ordered to rendezvous with and reinforce Nelson&#x27;s squadron. Nelson was in the Mediterranean hunting for a large French fleet which had sailed from Toulon carrying troops.

The French had embarked on a complex land and naval campaign in the Mediterranean, with the ultimate aim of launching an invasion and occupation of Egypt. The British were aware that the French had amassed a large army, led by General Napoleon Bonaparte, but their destination was unknown. Rendezvousing with Troubridge&#x27;s squadron on 7 June, Nelson now had a sufficient force to engage the French, and began to comb the Mediterranean. The search lasted nearly two months, with the British force tracking westwards, and then back east, sometimes missing the French force by days. The French force, after invading and capturing Malta, arrived off Alexandria on 1 July and began landing troops. It was not until 25 July that news reached Nelson, by then at anchor off Sicily, that the French fleet had appeared off Egypt. He took his fleet to sea, and arrived off Alexandria on 1 August, but found the harbour empty. Heading east, he discovered the French fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, four frigates and a number of gunboats, at anchor in Abu Qir Bay.

===Battle of the Nile===

It was late on 1 August when the British fleet appeared in the bay, and the French were at anchor in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d&#x27;Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack the head of the French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift down the line, while preventing the French rear from reinforcing the van and centre. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards the French centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error on the part of the crew or because the anchor had dragged, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun &quot;Orient&quot;.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; now found herself in a desperate position. The much more powerful three-decked &quot;Orient&quot; fired several broadsides into &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, smashing her boats, dismounting guns and cutting rigging. French marines on the higher decks poured volleys of musket fire onto &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s exposed upper decks. Between 60 and 70 of her crew were killed or wounded in the first stages of the engagement, including Darby, who was rendered unconscious by a head wound. Command then devolved to the first lieutenant, Lieutenant Daniel. Daniel and the second lieutenant, Lieutenant Lander, were both wounded, but were able to direct the fighting until a shot took away Daniel&#x27;s left leg. As he was carried below he was hit by grapeshot and killed outright. The fourth lieutenant, John Hadaway, was wounded and was taken below to the surgeon, while the fifth lieutenant, George Joliffe, was killed on the deck. After an hour fighting &quot;Orient&quot; alone, &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s mizzenmast collapsed, followed shortly afterwards by the mainmast. Lieutenant Lander was among those killed in the fall of the mainmast, and command devolved to the third lieutenant, the uninjured Lieutenant Robert Cathcart. Several fires had broken out on both &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Orient&quot;. According to &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s logbook, at 9pm, when a further fire broke out on &quot;Orient&quot;, Cathcart was down below on duty, and the 13 year old Midshipman John Hindmarsh was briefly the senior officer on deck. He ordered the anchor cable cut and the spritsail was hoisted, but put too great a strain on the foremast, which collapsed. Now totally dismasted, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; began to drift away from the action, her crew fighting fires. As she moved out of the line she received some long range shots from the French &quot;Tonnant&quot;.

As &quot;Bellerophon&quot; slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , approaching the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; in the darkness &quot;Swiftsure&quot;″s captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed that she was a damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of &quot;Orient&quot;, close to &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order the battered &quot;Bellerophon&quot; came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.

===Britain and West Indies service===
After carrying out temporary repairs in Abu Qir Bay, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; hoisted jury masts and, towing the captured &quot;Spartiate&quot; with HMS &quot;Majestic&quot;, sailed to Gibraltar for a refit. When this was completed she returned to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 2 April 1800, where she paid off and entered the dockyard for a more substantial refit in September. These works amounted to £32,608 and lasted until August 1801. She recommissioned on 25 June 1801 under the command of Captain Lord Garlies and sailed in August to rejoin the Channel Fleet, which was blockading Brest. Lord Garlies was superseded by Captain John Loring on 25 November, and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; continued on the blockade.

In 1802, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was among five ships ordered to join Admiral John Duckworth&#x27;s squadron in the West Indies. After taking on supplies, she sailed from Torbay on 2 March 1802. By the time of her arrival on 27 March, the Treaty of Amiens had been signed, so Britain and France were at peace. For the next eighteen months &quot;Bellerophon&quot; cruised in the Jamaica Passage and escorted merchant convoys between Jamaica and Halifax, Nova Scotia.

==Napoleonic Wars==

===West Indies and return to Britain===
&quot;Bellerophon&quot; was in the West Indies when the Napoleonic Wars broke out in May 1803. Her captain, John Loring, was appointed commodore of the British squadron, which quickly went on the offensive against French shipping in the Blockade of Saint-Domingue. In mid-1803, the squadron under Captain Henry William Bayntun, consisting of HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, , , , and captured the French privateers &quot;Poisson Volant&quot; and . The Royal Navy took both into service. The corvette &quot;Mignonne&quot; and a brig were captured in late June, after which the British patrolled off Cap-François. On 24 July the squadron, made up of &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and the 74-gun ships HMS &quot;Elephant&quot;, and HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot;, came across two French 74-gun ships, &quot;Duquesne&quot; and &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, and the frigate &quot;Guerrière&quot;, attempting to escape from Cap-François. The squadron gave chase, and on 25 July overhauled and captured &quot;Duquesne&quot; after a few shots were fired, while &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot; and &quot;Guerrière&quot; managed to evade their pursuers and escape to France. One man was killed aboard &quot;Bellerophon&quot; during the pursuit. She remained blockading Cap-François until November, when the French commander of the garrison there, General Rochambeau, approached Loring and requested to be allowed to evacuate his men, which were being besieged by a native Haitian force led by Jean-Jacques Dessalines. To prevent Rochambeau escaping, Loring sent launches from &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Elephant&quot; into the Caracol Passage where they cut out the French schooner &quot;Découverte&quot; on 22–23 November. The French formally surrendered on 30 November and were allowed to evacuate on three frigates, &quot;Surveillante&quot;, &quot;Clorinde&quot;, and &quot;Vertu&quot;, and a number of smaller ships, and were escorted to Jamaica by the squadron.

A particularly severe outbreak of malaria struck the ship in early February 1804; 212 members of &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s crew fell ill. 17 died aboard the ship, while 100 had to be transferred to a shore-based hospital, where a further 40 died. She was ordered back to Britain in June, escorting a large convoy, and arrived in the Downs on 11 August. She briefly paid off and was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit. On 27 September four shipwrights working in the magazine by candle light set off some loose powder. The explosion killed all four.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; rejoined the Channel Fleet, still off Brest, and under the command of Admiral Sir William Cornwallis. These duties lasted until early 1805, with Loring being superseded by Captain John Cooke on 24 April.

===Approach to Trafalgar===
In May 1805 a large French fleet under the command of Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve escaped from Toulon. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was dispatched with a squadron under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood to patrol the Straits of Gibraltar. Before they could arrive, Villeneuve had collected Spanish reinforcements under Admiral Federico Gravina, and had sailed into the Atlantic, pursued by Nelson&#x27;s Mediterranean Fleet. While Nelson chased Villeneuve around the West Indies without making contact, Collingwood mounted a blockade of Cadiz. His squadron was still there in mid-August when Villeneuve appeared off the port with his fleet. Possessing too few ships to intercept the combined fleet, Collingwood allowed them to enter Cadiz, and then remounted the blockade. He was reinforced with a number of ships over the next few months, with Nelson taking over command on 28 September.

===Battle of Trafalgar===

Nelson mounted a loose blockade of the combined fleet, keeping most of his fleet out of sight, but with a line of frigates and larger ships stationed at intervals between himself and Cadiz. On 19 October the combined fleet was observed to be putting to sea, and the signal was passed down the line of ships. William Pryce Cumby, &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s first lieutenant, was first in the main fleet to spot the signal, flying from the last ship in the communication link, HMS &quot;Mars&quot;. The British began to pursue the combined fleet as it made its way towards the Straits of Gibraltar, and came in sight of it on the morning of 21 October. The officers and sailors of &quot;Bellerophon&quot; prepared for battle, some of the gun crews chalking the words &quot;Victory or Death&quot; on their gun barrels. At 11 am &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s signal midshipman, John Franklin, noted that Nelson had hoisted the signal &quot;England expects that every man will do his duty&quot;, and an hour and a half later &quot;Bellerophon&quot; entered the battle as the fifth ship in Collingwood&#x27;s lee column. She was astern of the 80-gun HMS &quot;Tonnant&quot; and ahead of the 74-gun , with the 74-gun close by her port side.

At 12:30 pm, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; cut through the enemy line, slipping under the stern of the Spanish 74-gun &quot;Monarca&quot; and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; collided with the French 74-gun &quot;Aigle&quot;, hitting &quot;Aigle&quot;″s port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships&#x27; yards. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard &quot;Aigle&quot; sweeping &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s decks with musket fire and grenades. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke&#x27;s distinctive epaulettes marked him out. Cumby urged him to take them off, only for Cooke to reply &quot;It is too late now to take them off. I see my situation but I will die like a man.&quot; &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was now sustaining fire from &quot;Aigle&quot; and three other ships, the Spanish &quot;San Juan Nepomuceno&quot; and &quot;Bahama&quot;, and the French &quot;Swiftsure&quot;. &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistols ... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster going up and asking him if he should take him down below, his answer was &quot;No, let me lie quietly one minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.&quot;

With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s decks had largely been cleared by French fire, and boarding parties began to make their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s spritsail yard, but a &quot;Bellerophon&quot; crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on &quot;Aigle&quot; reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into &quot;Bellerophon&quot; exploded in the gunner&#x27;s storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.

By 1:40 pm, having been under heavy fire for over an hour, &quot;Aigle&quot;″s crew lowered her gunports and slowly moved away. When the smoke cleared, Cumby noticed that the Spanish &quot;Monarca&quot;, which &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had first engaged, had struck her colours. Cumby sent an officer in a boat to take possession of her. &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s crew now worked to make repairs and clear away wreckage. She briefly fired her guns again when the van of the combined fleet, led by Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, made a belated attempt to come to the assistance of the centre and rear. The attack was beaten off, and at 5 pm, &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s guns ceased firing. At 5:30 pm Cumby sent a boat to take possession of &quot;Bahama&quot;, which had also struck her colours. By the end of the battle &quot;Bellerophon&quot; had sustained casualties of 27 men killed and 123 wounded. Among the dead were her captain, the master, John Overton, and midshipman John Simmons.

===Storm and return===
For the next seven days, &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s crew were occupied in repairing damage, rigging jury masts, and trying to ride out the storm that struck the area immediately after the battle. She put into Gibraltar on 28 October 1805, and underwent emergency repairs to allow her to return to England as an escort for , together with . Both &quot;Belleisle&quot; and &quot;Bellerophon&quot; required urgent attention, but it was deemed appropriate that they should have the honour of accompanying Nelson&#x27;s body back to Britain aboard &quot;Victory&quot;. Cumby was superseded on 3 November, the day before beginning the voyage home, by Captain Richard Thomas. Thomas was himself superseded the next day by Captain Edward Rotheram, who had commanded Collingwood&#x27;s flagship, , during the battle.

The three ships sailed together as far as Start Point, where on 2 December &quot;Victory&quot; separated to head to Portsmouth, while &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Belleisle&quot; put into Cawsand Bay. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was then taken into Plymouth Dockyard to be repaired, returning to active duty on 26 February, still under Rotheram&#x27;s command. Joining the Channel Fleet once more, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; resumed her usual duties, blockading and patrolling off Ushant and Brest.

===Baltic Sea===
Rotheram&#x27;s command lasted for two and half years, until he was superseded on 8 June 1808 by Captain Samuel Warren. Warren was ordered to take &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and join the fleet in the North Sea, blockading the Dutch ports. She formed part of Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner&#x27;s squadron. By 1809 the strategic situation in the Baltic had deteriorated after Russia signed the Treaties of Tilsit and began to support France. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was ordered to join the fleet stationed in the Baltic under Admiral Sir James Saumarez. Saumarez dispatched &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and north to the Gulf of Finland in June, and on 19 June the two ships came across three suspicious looking luggers, anchored off Hango. The water was too shallow to allow them to approach the luggers, so a boat party was dispatched under &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s Lieutenant Robert Pilch. The British boarded the luggers, but found themselves in a trap, when numerous Russian shore batteries and several gunboats opened fire on them. Pilch promptly ordered the luggers to be burnt, reboarded his men and landed them next to the nearest Russian shore battery. The battery, defended by 100 sailors, was stormed and carried; the British spiked the guns and destroyed the magazine before returning to the ships with only five men wounded.

By July &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was part of a squadron commanded by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS &quot;Implacable&quot;. They were off Percola Point on 7 July when a flotilla of eight Russian gunboats was sighted. A boat party led by Lieutenant Hawkey of &quot;Implacable&quot; made an attempt to cut-out the vessels that evening. Hawkey was killed in the attempt, but &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s Lieutenant Charles Allen took over command, and six of the gunboats were captured, and a seventh destroyed, with 12 craft containing stores for the Russian Army also being taken. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; made several cruises during the rest of the year, visiting Åland and Karlskrona, before returning to Britain with a convoy in November 1809.

===Blockade duty===

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; was briefly refitted in January 1810, after which she was anchored at the Nore. She then resumed her blockade duties in the North Sea, serving under a succession of commanders. Warren was succeeded by Captain John Halsted on 23 August, and he by Captain Augustus Brine on 5 November. Brine&#x27;s command lasted until February 1813, during which time &quot;Bellerophon&quot; remained with the North Sea blockading squadron. Captain Edward Hawker took over command on 11 February 1813. On 7 April the flag was flown for the convoy to North America to assemble. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was joined by Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Goodwin Keats, the newly appointed Governor of Newfoundland and the convoy departed. After picking up a smaller convoy at Torbay the fleet comprised eighty-four vessels, all arriving safely at St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland on 31 May.

With the War of 1812 underway in North America, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; then sailed south to Bermuda as a convoy escort. Returning to St. John&#x27;s in the summer, she captured several American ships, including the 16-gun privateer &quot;Genie&quot;. She spent the rest of the year patrolling off Cape Race. In need of further work in the docks she accompanied Sir Richard Goodwin Keats on his return to Britain with a convoy in November 1813. The year 1814 was spent on similar duties: &quot;Bellerophon&quot; carried Governor Keats back to Newfoundland while escorting a convoy to St. John&#x27;s between April and June, and then patrolled off Cape Race until December. She then moved to the Nore, and on 9 April 1815 Hawker was replaced by Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland.

==Napoleon&#x27;s surrender==
In May &quot;Bellerophon&quot; sailed to Plymouth, where she joined a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Hotham with orders to blockade French Atlantic ports. Hotham, flying his flag in , sent Maitland in &quot;Bellerophon&quot; to watch Rochefort, where two French frigates, a brig and a corvette were lying in the harbour. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; spent over a month on this station, patrolling the approaches to the port and intercepting coastal vessels. Meanwhile, Napoleon had been defeated at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June; on 2 July he arrived in Rochefort. Following the defeat of his armies, and expecting the imminent restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, Napoleon hoped to sail to exile in the United States. The British had no intention of allowing this. News reached Maitland in early July that Napoleon was in Rochefort. Two 20-gun ships, and , were sent to reinforce &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and patrol the other entrances to the port.

Napoleon was being pressured to leave French soil by the interim French government in Paris. If he delayed, he risked becoming a prisoner of the Bourbons, Prussians or Austrians. The alternative was to surrender to the British and request political asylum. On 10 July Napoleon sent two emissaries, General Anne Jean Marie René Savary and the Comte de Las Cases, out to &quot;Bellerophon&quot; to meet Maitland and discuss the possibility of allowing Napoleon to travel to the United States. Maitland was under orders to prevent this, and instead offered to take Napoleon on board his ship and transport him and his retinue to Britain. Further discussions and negotiations took place over the next few days, but with his options running out, Napoleon had decided by 13 July to surrender to the British. On 14 July Maitland was given a letter informing him that Napoleon would come out to &quot;Bellerophon&quot; the following morning to surrender.

Napoleon embarked aboard the brig &quot;Épervier&quot; early in the morning of 15 July, and made his way out to &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. As he approached, the 74-gun &quot;Superb&quot;, flying Vice-Admiral Hotham&#x27;s flag, was sighted approaching. Concerned that the brig might not reach &quot;Bellerophon&quot; before &quot;Superb&quot; arrived, and that consequently Hotham would take over and receive Napoleon himself, Maitland sent &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s barge to collect the former Emperor and transfer him to the ship. At some point between 6 and 7 a.m., the barge pulled alongside &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and General Henri Gatien Bertrand climbed aboard, followed by Napoleon. The ship&#x27;s marines came to attention, and Napoleon walked to the quarterdeck, took his hat off to Maitland and in French announced &quot;I am come to throw myself on the protection of your Prince and your laws.&quot; Maitland bowed in response. With the former emperor in custody aboard a British warship, the Napoleonic Wars were finally over. To maritime historian David Cordingly, this moment was &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s &quot;crowning glory [when] six weeks after the battle of Waterloo, ... Napoleon, trapped in Rochefort, surrendered to the captain of the ship that had dogged his steps for more than twenty years.&quot;

===Napoleon on &quot;Bellerophon&quot;===

Maitland showed Napoleon the great cabin, which he had placed at his disposal, and gave him a tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m., &quot;Superb&quot; anchored in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon&#x27;s retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on &quot;Superb&quot;, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS &quot;Myrmidon&quot;. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, talking with him only if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as &quot;Bellerophon&quot; came in sight of Ushant, the last piece of French land visible for the remainder of the journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; anchored off Brixham on the morning of 24 July, and there Maitland received orders from Admiral Lord Keith to &quot;prevent every person whatever from coming on board the ship you command, except the officers and men who compose her crew.&quot; Despite turning away the shore boats which approached the anchored warship bringing fresh bread and fruit to sell, word eventually leaked out that Napoleon was aboard the ship. The news created a sensation, and large numbers of boats filled with sightseers soon surrounded the ship. Occasionally Napoleon would come out to look at them, but despite entreaties from some people to be allowed on board, Maitland refused to allow any contact between ship and shore. On 26 July &quot;Bellerophon&quot; received orders to proceed to Plymouth harbour where Lord Keith was anchored aboard his flagship . Napoleon remained on board &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and the ship was kept isolated from the throngs of curious sightseers by two guardships, and , anchored close at hand.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; spent two weeks in Plymouth harbour while the authorities came to a decision about what to do with Napoleon. On 31 July they communicated their decision to the former emperor. Napoleon was to be exiled to the remote island of Saint Helena. He would be allowed to take three officers, his surgeon, and twelve servants. Napoleon, who had hoped to be allowed to settle quietly in Britain, was bitterly disappointed by the news. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was not to take him into exile. The Admiralty was concerned that the ageing ship was unsuitable for the long voyage to the South Atlantic, and the 74-gun was selected for the task. On 4 August, Lord Keith ordered &quot;Bellerophon&quot; to go to sea and await the arrival of HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot;. On 7 August Napoleon thanked Maitland and his crew for their kindness and hospitality, and left &quot;Bellerophon,&quot; where he had spent over three weeks without ever landing in England. He boarded &quot;Northumberland,&quot; which then sailed for Saint Helena.

Captain Maitland&#x27;s account of the time Napoleon spent on board his ship was published in 1826.

==Prison hulk and disposal==
Having discharged Napoleon, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; sailed to Sheerness, and anchored there on 2 September. There she was paid off for the last time, and stripped of her guns and masts. With no further need for many ships following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; joined a number of ships laid up in this manner. A report on 16 October 1815 advised moving a number of convicts previously housed aboard the former into more suitable accommodation. The report suggested that &quot;The class of ship, which I take the liberty of observing as most suitable for this service, would be a seventy-four, of about the same dimensions as &quot;Bellerophon&quot; in the river Medway, being of easy draft of water and lofty between decks.&quot; The report was approved and the suggestion acted upon. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was taken into Sheerness Dockyard in December 1815 and spent nine months fitting out as a prison ship.

The work was completed at a cost of £12,081 and the prisoners were transferred in January 1817. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; generally held around 435 prisoners during her time in this role, although in 1823 changes in legislation resulted in the adult prisoners being transferred out of &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and the ship instead being used to house boy prisoners, with 320 arriving in early 1824. In 1824 the decision was taken to rename , an 80-gun ship launched in 1818, HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;. To free the name, the former HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was renamed &quot;Captivity&quot; on 5 October 1824. On 23 November 1824 she was driven ashore in a storm at Portsmouth. She continued as a prison ship for boys until early 1826, when it was decided that the arrangement of the internal spaces made her unsuitable for workshops. The boys were transferred to another hulk, the former , and it was decided to move &quot;Captivity&quot; to Plymouth. The ship was taken into Sheerness Dockyard in April 1826, and was fitted out for the journey to Plymouth. She arrived there in June and spent the last eight years of her working existence as a convict hulk in Plymouth. By 1834 the rate of penal transportation had been drastically increased to clear out the old hulks. When the last convicts had left &quot;Captivity&quot;, she was handed back to the Navy Department, who put her up for sale.

The Board of Admiralty announced that &quot;Captivity&quot; would be offered for sale on 21 January 1836; she was described as being 1613 tons and lying at Plymouth. The hulk was sold on that day for £4,030 (). She was broken up for scrap, and her timber was sold by auction in September 1836.

==Legacy==
Some of &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s timber was bought at auction by George Bellamy, who had been &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s surgeon at the Nile. Bellamy incorporated them into a cottage he was building at Plymstock. It is now a Grade II listed building. Captain Maitland bought part of her figurehead and some of her stern ornaments, later depositing them in the collections of what eventually became the Royal Naval Museum. The National Maritime Museum holds several relics relating to &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and the people connected with her, including Captain John Cooke&#x27;s dirk, sword and pistol, and a trophy presented to Admiral Pasley by Lloyd&#x27;s of London. Their collections also contain artefacts relating to her connection with Napoleon, including the couch from Maitland&#x27;s cabin, and the skull of a goat which supplied milk for Napoleon and his suite.

===&quot;Bellerophon&quot; in art, music and literature===

The ship and her crew feature, or are mentioned, in several historical novels set during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, including several of the Aubrey–Maturin series of novels by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, and the novel &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Trafalgar&quot; by Bernard Cornwell.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; appears in a number of artworks, including several depicting the ship&#x27;s role in Napoleon&#x27;s surrender. Sir William Quiller Orchardson painted &quot;Napoleon on the Bellerophon&quot;, depicting the former emperor standing on the poop deck, watching the French coastline recede as his retinue look on. Sir Charles Lock Eastlake painted a portrait of Napoleon in uniform, standing on &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s deck, while John James Chalon produced &quot;Scene in Plymouth Sound in August 1815&quot;, a seascape, with &quot;Bellerophon&quot; surrounded by crowds of people in small boats. Thomas Luny painted a similar scene, showing &quot;Bellerophon&quot; putting into Torbay to rendezvous with HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot;. Numerous popular prints and engravings were also produced, depicting moments from Napoleon&#x27;s arrival on &quot;Bellerophon&quot; to surrender, to his final transfer to &quot;Northumberland&quot; for his voyage into exile. The ship also appears in prints and paintings of the battles she had fought in. She is depicted on the Cadiz blockade with the rest of the inshore squadron in a work by Thomas Buttersworth, and is visible at the Glorious First of June in works by Nicholas Pocock, Cornwallis&#x27;s Retreat by William Anderson, and the Battles of the Nile and Trafalgar by Thomas Whitcombe.

&quot;Bellerophon&quot; is mentioned in several verses in a song commemorating Cornwallis&#x27;s Retreat in 1795, which celebrate both Cornwallis (referred to by sailors&#x27; popular nickname for him, &quot;Billy Blue&quot;), and &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s fighting record at the Glorious First of June. The folk song &quot;Boney was a Warrior&quot;, about the life of Napoleon, includes a verse celebrating the ship&#x27;s links with his ultimate surrender:Boney went a-cruisin&#x27;&quot;Way-aye-yah!&quot;Aboard the Billy Ruffian&quot;Johnny Franswor!&quot;

==Notes==

a. This revived design is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Edgar&quot; class.

b. Greaves had originally approached the Navy Board in December 1781 with a proposal to build a 64-gun ship at his yard at Limehouse, and a 74-gun ship and a frigate at Frindsbury. The Board turned him down, feeling that the Limehouse yard was unsuitable for building anything larger than a 44-gun ship, and that the Frindsbury yard was too close to the Navy&#x27;s own shipbuilding facilities at Chatham. Commercial yards paid higher wages than the Navy&#x27;s yards and the Board was concerned skilled workmen would be poached from Chatham. Greaves promised not to employ men from the Chatham yard, and the Board decided to offer him the contract for a 74-gun ship on 8 January 1782. Greaves signed the contract on 19 February 1782.

c. To build and fit &quot;Bellerophon&quot; for service required 2,000 trees (amounting to 50 acres), 100 tons of iron bolts, 30 tons of copper bolts, 30,000 treenails, 4,000 copper sheets, 12 tons of tar, 400 gallons of linseed oil, 5 tons of paint, 10,000 square yards of canvas, 80 tons of shot, 20 tons of gunpowder, 200 tons of provisions and 260 tons of fresh water.

d. Sources agree that four men were killed, but while Winfield and Goodwin report twenty-seven wounded, Cordingly has the slightly higher figure of thirty wounded.

e. Darby may have intended to anchor alongside the 80-gun &quot;Franklin&quot;, the ship immediately ahead of &quot;Orient&quot;, or to have tacked alongside the gap between &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Orient&quot;, so as to be able to rake &quot;Orient&quot;″s bows. Cordingly considers that the reason for the ultimate positioning was never explained. Adkin prefers the explanation that Darby intended to rake &quot;Orient&quot;″s bows, but the anchor had dragged.

f. This was among the highest casualty figures of any of the British ships. Only the 50 dead and 143 wounded of HMS &quot;Majestic&quot; was comparable. &quot;Bellerophon&quot;″s total casualty list of 197 was slightly higher than &quot;Majestic&quot;″s 193, and amounted to nearly a quarter of the total British casualties in the battle. Robert Cathcart, as the senior surviving lieutenant, was recommended for promotion by Earl St Vincent, a recommendation the Admiralty accepted, advancing him to commander.

g. Cumby shared in the rewards after Trafalgar. He was promoted twice in rapid succession, to commander on 24 December 1805, and to post-captain on 1 January 1806.

h. Napoleon wrote a letter in the evening of 13 July, addressed to the Prince of Wales, prince regent during the illness of his father, King George III, Your Royal Highness,A victim to the factions which distract my country, and to the enmity of the greatest powers of Europe, I have terminated my political career, and I come, like Themistocles, to throw myself upon the hospitality of the British people. I put myself under the protection of their laws; which I claim from your Royal Highness, as the most powerful, the most constant, and the most generous of my enemies.Rochefort 13 July 1815Napoleon

<text>The city of Houston in the U.S. state of Texas was founded in 1837 after Augustus and John Allen had acquired land to establish a new town at the junction of Buffalo and White Oak bayous in 1836. Houston served as the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas. Meanwhile, the town developed as a regional transportation and commercial hub. Houston was part of an independent nation until 1846 when the United States formally annexed Texas. Railroad development began in the late 1850s but ceased during the American Civil War. Houston served the Confederacy as a regional military logistics center. The population increased during the war and blockade runners used the town as a center for their operations.

Investment and development of railroads serving Houston increased the transportation options for freight and passengers while greatly increasing the number of jobs. The city limits extended to an area north of Buffalo Bayou after the American Civil War. Houston continued as an important business, social, and economic center of Texas, while establishing the first State Fair starting in 1870 and continuing through 1878.

The population surpassed 58,000 in 1900, the same year as the Great Hurricane struck Galveston. Within a few years, oil companies were establishing offices in Houston to administer oil fields in East Texas. In 1912, the Rice Institute opened its doors on its suburban campus, the first institute of higher learning in the Houston area. Several tall buildings were completed that year, including those used for offices and residences. Tax Commissioner Joseph Jay Pastoriza gained national notoriety for his property tax reform, though it was later invalidated by the Texas Supreme Court. Around this time Houston started drawing immigrants from Mexico, a trend continuing into the 1920s. Many settled in the Second Ward. During this period, the city developed Hermann Park. Houston gained national prominence when it hosted the Democratic National Convention in 1928.

==Before 1836==
The region known as Houston is located on land that was once home of the Karankawa &quot;(kə rang′kə wä′,-wô′,-wə)&quot; and the Atakapa &quot;(əˈtɑːkəpə)&quot; indigenous peoples for at least 2,000 years before the first known settlers arrived. However, the land remained largely uninhabited from 1700s until settlement in the 1830s.

==Republic of Texas, 18361845==

On the heels of the Texas Revolution, two real estate promoters who had arrived in Texas in 1832, John Kirby Allen and Augustus Chapman Allen, were seeking a new town site within the Galveston Bay navigation system. They had invested in Galveston already, but they continued to make offers for other tracts in the region. They bid on land at Morgan&#x27;s Point and Harrisburg before settling on the eventual Houston site. On August 26, 1836, they purchased half a league of land, or about 2,214 acres (27 km2) from Elizabeth (Mrs. T. F. L.) Parrot, John Austin&#x27;s widow for $5,000. Four days later, the Allen brothers placed an advertisement in the &quot;Telegraph and Texas Register&quot; for the paper town of Houston. Gail Borden and his assistant Moses Lapham conducted preliminary surveying work in October, taking field notes and laying stakes. Meanwhile, John Allen was back in Columbia lobbying members of Texas Congress to designate the not yet surveyed town and promising to construct government buildings. On November 30, a special joint session of Congress considered fifteen possible locations for the next seat of government. On the first ballot, ten of these locations garnered votes, but Houston gained a majority of votes on the fourth ballot.

The Allen brothers chose a site at the confluence of White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou, which served as a natural turning basin, now known as Allen&#x27;s Landing. The &quot;Laura&quot;, the first steamship ever to visit Houston, arrived in January 1837, at which time the town totaled twelve residents and one log cabin. Four months later there were 1,500 people and 100 houses. Critical to the promotion of Houston by the Allen brothers was the importance of its location as a natural logistical center. They claimed that the town lay at the &quot;head of navigation&quot; on Buffalo Bayou. Their critics cast doubt on the navigability of Buffalo Bayou as far upstream as Houston, who had not been convinced by the arrival of the &quot;Laura&quot;. A true test would be a larger ship making the trip. The Allen brothers commissioned the 262-ton &quot;Constitution&quot; to travel to Houston. Captain Edward Auld piloted the large, deep-draft steamer to the wharf at the foot of Main Street, and earned $1,000 for performing this task. However, the &quot;Constitution&quot;measuring at 150 feetwas too long to make the three point turn using the mouth of White Oak Bayou. Unable to turn the ship around at Houston, Auld ran the engines in reverse for over six miles until he found a natural turning basin. The Allen brothers published an announcement of the &quot;Constitution&quot;&#x27;s feat with the headline, &quot;The Fact Proven.&quot;

In May 1837, the Texas Congress met for the first time in Houston. The First Texas Congress had initially convened in Columbia, Texas, but adjourned the first session on December 22, 1836. The First Congress reconvened in Houston to finish its business five months later. Houston was granted incorporation by the Texas legislature on June 5, 1837. At this time, drunkenness, dueling, brawling, prostitution, and profanity began to become a problem in early Houston. Soon, Houstonians were prompted to put an end to their problems; so, they wanted to make a Chamber of Commerce just for the city. A bill had been introduced on November 26, 1838, in Congress that would establish this entity. President Mirabeau B. Lamar signed the act into law on January 28, 1840. This move could not have come sooner, as the city was suffering from financial problems and numerous yellow fever outbreaks, including an 1839 outbreak that killed about 12 percent of its population. Also, on January 14, 1839, the capital had been moved to Austin, known as Waterloo at the time. On April 4, 1840, John Carlos hosted a meeting to establish the Houston Chamber of Commerce at the City Exchange building. E.S. Perkins presided as its first president. In addition to Perkins and Carlos, the charter members admitted were: Henry R. Allen, T. Francis Brewer, Jacob De Cordova, J. Temple Doswell, George Gazley, Dewitt C. Harris, J. Hart, Charles J. Hedenburg, Thomas M. League, Charles Kesler, Charles A. Morris, E. Osborne, and John W. Pitkin. Undergrowth and snags had been the greatest obstacle to navigating Buffalo Bayou; yet by 1840, there was an accumulation of sunken ships. This was the principal concern of the new Houston Chamber of Commerce. The city of Houston and Harris County responded by allocating taxpayer money for bayou clearance, and on March 1, 1841, the first wreck was pulled out the bayou under this program.
The original municipal government structure was a mayor and eight aldermen, all elected at large. Two charter amendments, one in 1839 and the other in 1840, divided the town into four wards, using Main and Commerce streets as axes. Each ward elected two alderman under this system. The wards are no longer political divisions, but some of the names are still used, even though they do not refer to the original boundaries.

Serious violence was a daily occurrence in the late-1830s. In addition to assault via a gentleman&#x27;s cane, street violence emanated from Houston&#x27;s many saloons and brothels. When Mexico was again threatening Texas, President Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston on June 27, 1842. However, the Austin residents wanted to keep the archives in their city. This would be known as the Archive Wars. The capital was then moved to Washington on-the-Brazos on September 29. Austin became capital again in 1845, just before Texas gained statehood.

==Early statehood, 18451861==

In the early statehood era, historian Harold Platt notes the emergence of &quot;commercial-civic elites,&quot; a term borrowed from Blaine A. Brownell. Commercial leaders blurred sharp distinctions between economic activity and social relationships. One example was the business partnership of Thomas W. House and Charles Shearn. House started in Houston as a junior partner with the elder Shearn. House married Shearn&#x27;s daughter while transitioning from his bakery into a cotton mercantile store, and later moving into the banking and real estate businesses. By the mid-1850s, his investment portfolio included transportation concerns, such as plank roads, railroads, and navigation companies. House was a founder of the Shearn Methodist Church and a co-founder of the first volunteer fire company in Houston. In 1857 he was elected as an alderman.

During Houston&#x27;s first few years, it had many characteristics of a frontier town. Though this trend briefly reversed, the demographics of Houston&#x27;s free population regressed toward those of a frontier town again during the 1850s. The imbalance in population favoring males increased, the median age was greater than the US at-large, and these males were less likely to be married. The number of young men quadrupled from 1850 to 1860, but the total population merely doubled during the same period. In 1850, Houston had 115 males for every hundred females, and this ratio increased to 136 per hundred by 1860. Saloons and gambling halls proliferated and were well attended, and violence was common. One in three Houstonians were born abroad, many coming from German-speaking countries. More than one of every five Houstonians during this period was an enslaved person. Though the percentage of bondsmen in Houston was comparable to those of other southern cities, there was a lower proportion of slaveowners. The practice of &quot;hiring out&quot; enslaved persons was common in Houston at the eve of the American Civil War. Houston&#x27;s total population grew to 4,428 by 1860, and its footprint expanded to the southwest by several blocks, reaching to a part of current-day Hadley Street. Urban bondsmen performed manual labor, such as construction, or moving freight at the wharf or to and from the warehouses; others worked as servants at private homes and hotels, or as cooks and waiters. 
Railroads started to emanate from Houston in the 1850s. However, the first railroad to operate in Texas was the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway, which terminated at Harrisburg, Houston&#x27;s rival to the east. This road began service in 1853. Houston gained access to this railway to the Brazos bottoms in October 1856 through the construction of the Houston Tap Road. Construction on a railroad based in Houston started in 1853. The railroad, which was later known as the Houston and Texas Central Railway (H&amp;TC), was complete to Cypress in 1853. The H&amp;TC progressed beyond Cypress, laying track through Hempstead and Navasota, and reached Millican on the eve of the Civil War. Meanwhile, in 1858, the municipally owned Houston Tap was acquired by a private railroad developer, and served as the basis for the Houston Tap and Brazoria Railway, a road to the sugar plantations, which began service to Columbia in 1860. Another railroad opened during this period, accessing Houston from its initial southern terminus opposite Galveston. The Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad completed tracks from Virginia Point to Houston on January 8, 1859. The next year Houston provided railroad access to Galveston when the Island City finished the long viaduct across the back bay. From 1857, the Texas and New Orleans Railroad broke ground north of Buffalo Bayou in 1857 and continued to construct the road into East Texas through 1860.

==American Civil War, 18611865==

In 1860, most Houstonians supported John C. Breckinridge, the Southern Democratic candidate for president. As the American Civil War began, there was tension between supporters of the Confederacy and the few Union sympathizers. There are no voting tallies for Houston and there are inconsistencies in the records of the secession vote, yet, Harris County voted heavily in favor of secession on February 23, 1861, by a margin as high as seven-to-one. The Chamber of Commerce kept the city together during the conflict.

Houston was an important regional center during the Confederacy. The town served as a military logistics center, the Quartermaster Depot for Texas, and the headquarters of a wartime administrative district which included Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. An influx of refugees from Louisiana and Galveston nearly doubled Houston&#x27;s wartime population compared to 1860. Since the town suffered no direct attacks, it was prosperous compared to many other communities in the South. Though some key merchants like William Marsh Rice left at the start of the war, businessmen from New Orleans and Galveston replaced them. Blockade runners sometimes used Houston as a port, and on occasion the Main Street wharf received foreign cargo. Despite disruptions to supply from the Union blockades, advertisements indicate at least occasional availability of staples, such as sugar, coffee, and soap; clothing, including pants, shirts, and footwear; and building supplies, like brick, and even milled pine. However, the supply of goods was not consistent, and there were periodic shortages of some staples, causing hyperflation and the need to find substitute goods, such as flavoring hot drinks with okra seeds in place of coffee. Specie was in short supply throughout the war. Housing scarcity caused rents to rise, but wages increased at the same time.

==Post-Civil War, 1866–1900==
===Reconstruction===
The end of the American Civil War and news of emancipation spurred an influx of former slaves from the countryside into Houston. The town&#x27;s incumbent black residents organized groups to help these newcomers obtain housing and employment. In the short term, however, many of these new citizens resided in abandoned buildings and tent communities.

Houston added the Fifth Ward in 1866, and the Sixth Ward in 1877. Each ward was represented by two aldermen, though by 1870, local representation was unequal based on population of the respective wards. The Fourth Ward counted 3,055 residents, contrasted with the First Ward with only 738 residents. The city did not adjust the ward boundaries to compensate for these unequal settlement patterns.

In 1869, the Ship Channel Company was formed to deepen Buffalo Bayou and improve Houston as a shipping port. Despite the postwar social unrest, migrants flocked to Texas for new opportunities. Texas businessmen joined to expand the railroad network, which contributed to Houston&#x27;s primacy in the state and the development of Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio and El Paso.

After Texas was readmitted to the Union on April 16, 1870, Houston continued its growth. Houston was designated as an official port of entry on July 16, 1870. Its new charter drew up eight wards. Many freedmen opened businesses and worked for wages under contracts. The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau stopped abuse of the contracts in 1870. Many African Americans at the time were in unskilled labor. Many former slaves legalized their marriages after the American Civil War. White legislators insisted on segregated schools. White Democrats regained power in the state legislature in the late 1870s, often after violence and intimidation to suppress African-American voting. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Texas passed a new constitution and laws that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans by making voter registration and voting more complicated and subject to white administration. The Democratic-dominated legislature passed Jim Crow laws to establish and enforce legal segregation across the state.

Houston was the site of the first Texas State Fair in 1870. The Mechanical and Blood Stock Association of Texas convened the first and second state fairs on a temporary site north of Buffalo Bayou. The organization later purchased a more lasting fairground area within the Obedience Smith Survey, in an area more recently known as &quot;Midtown,&quot; south of the original Houston survey. They used this new site for the first time in 1872, where new streetcar service conveyed visitors between the fair and central Houston. The last fair State fair in Houston was held in 1878.

===Gilded Age===
Houston continued its rapid population growth which started in the 1860s. Houston, like many other cities, attracted many Americans seeking job opportunities. In 1870, Houston counted 9,382 residents and grew by rates of 77 percent, 67 percent, and 62 percent in the following three decades. The percentage of foreign-born Houstonians declined from 17 percent in 1870 to 11 percent in 1890, but the percentage of African-American residents held steady.

Houston City Streetway Company (HCSC) began operating construction and operation of animal-powered streetcar lines in 1874. The first streetcar service began in 1868, but these early attempts to establish service in Houston were commercial failures. HCSC developed service in the business district, then centered on Congress Avenue and Main Street, though one the first four lines extended as fair south as the Fairgrounds. Another line offered service on Congress to the International &amp; Great Northern Railroad depot. Suburban subdivisions were developed near the Fairgrounds around the same time, and residential developers used the emerging streetcar lines to promote these new subdivisions. Lots sales in these more remote areas, however, did not sell quickly in the 1870s. An upstart company, the Bayou City Street Railway, built its main line further south on Texas Avenue in 1883. Later the same year, William Sinclair and Henry MacGregor acquired both streetcar companies and consolidated their operations. From 1874 until 1891 all of the transit service was operated using mule-driven streetcars, when electric streetcars began to be implemented in their place.

Lumber became a large part of the port&#x27;s exports, with merchandise as its chief import. The &quot;Houston Post&quot; was established in 1880. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; followed on August 23 of that year. In 1887, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word established a hospital that would become St. Joseph Hospital.

According to the 1890 U.S. census, Houston was home to 210 manufacturers hiring over 3,000 employees, about 300 of whom were white-collar workers. These companies included metal working facilities, such as blacksmith shops, iron foundries, and wheelwrights; woodworkers, such as cabinet makers and millworks; and many publishers and printers. Over 1,100 workers were employed by Houston railroads, many of them at the large shops of the Southern Pacific Railroad, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, and the Houston, East and West Texas Railway. Three years later, there were ten railroads doing business in Houston.
==Progressive era, 1901–1928==

On September 8, the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 savagely tore apart the city of Galveston, Texas. Houston suffered mainly property damage from high winds and four inches of rainfall, though one death was reported. The city mobilized to convey fresh water, food, medical supplies, and clothing to Galveston via steamboat and repaired damaged railroads in order to reestablish service to the island. Survivors fled Galveston to seek temporary shelter in Houston. The 1900 census reported that 58,203 people were living in Houston. A year later, wildcatters were digging wells at Spindletop as Houston emerged as a regional petroleum center, the home base of many new oil companies. A few Houstonians were buying the first automobiles in the city, while two local breweries produced and sold more than 200,000 barrels of beer. Two major fires struck the city, destroying the Market House and one of the top hotels in town, Hutchins House. New subdivisions developed along the streetcar lines, mostly toward the south. One new addition to the city was Westmoreland.

Around 1910, large numbers of Mexican immigrants settled in the &quot;Segundo Barrio&quot; (Second Ward), near industrial jobs for railroads and manufacturers of supplies for railroads. The Rusk Settlement House and El Campo Laurel lodge were two Second Ward organizations serving the emerging Mexican community in Houston. The Archdiocese of Galveston dispatched a missionary to the area, and later this initiative evolved into the Lady of Guadalupe Church. Several Protestant churches in the area followed. Revolution in Mexico the same year changed the immigration dynamic. In some cases, war induced Mexican-Houstonians to return to their native country to join the fight or assist family, but as the war dragged on, immigration from Mexico to Houston increased, mostly from the northern states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and San Luis Potosí. Civil unrest in Mexico persisted into the 1920s, promoting continued immigration and the development of a robust Mexican-American community in Houston.

In 1912, Joseph Jay Pastoriza introduced property tax reform to Houston. The &quot;Houston Single Tax Plan&quot; was based on Georgist principles and redistributed property tax burden from owners of personal property and developed land to owners of undeveloped land. While the Houston Plan was not a true single tax, it re-weighted appraisals to 70 percent of unimproved land and 25 percent of developed land. Personal property was exempt from local taxes according to this plan. This continued for a few years until 1915, when two courts ruled the plan illegal according to the Texas Constitution. Pastoriza continued to serve as Houston Tax Commissioner until 1917, when he became the first Mayor of Houston of Hispanic heritage. He died after just three months in office.

In 1912, Houston established its first institution of higher learning. The Rice Institute, now Rice University, opened with an endowment of around $9 million. The board hired Edgar Odell Lovett as the school&#x27;s first president, who recruited Julian Huxley as a professor of biology and Harold Wilson as a professor of physics.

By 1912, Houston was home to twenty-five &quot;tall buildings&quot; ranging from six to sixteen stories. Office buildings extant in 1912 include the eleven-story Scanlan Building, the marble-clad South Texas National Bank Building, the eight-story First National Bank Building, the twelve-story Union National Bank, the ten-story Houston Chronicle Building, and the Southwestern Telephone Company Building. The sixteen-story Carter Building was the tallest in Houston. There were two major passenger train facilities, Union Station and Grand Central Station. Residential buildings included the Beaconsfield apartments, Rossonian apartments, the Savoy flats, and the Hotel Bender. Under construction in 1912 was the Rice Hotel.

In early 1917 the U.S. War Department ordered two military installations to be built in Harris County: Camp Logan and Ellington Field. The U.S. Army deployed a battalion of the all-black 24th Infantry Regiment to guard the construction site at Camp Logan. Racial tension in the city rose as the black soldiers received hostile treatment in the racially segregated city. Tensions flared into a full-blown riot in August 1917; the Camp Logan Riot resulted in the deaths of fifteen whites (including four policemen) and four black soldiers, and scores of additional injuries.

During the 1920s, the city of Houston developed Hermann Park based in part on plans by Arthur Comey and George Kessler on land donated by George H. Hermann in 1922. The Houston Zoological Garden opened on the park grounds two years later. The park complex expanded with the construction of Museum of Natural History and a full-size golf course. Several smaller buildings were also added, as well as several curving roads to provide automobile access through the grounds. Will Hogg donated another large tract for an expansion to the park.

Houston hosted the 1928 Democratic National Convention. The city council and Mayor Oscar Holcombe appropriated $100,000 for a new convention hall. They commissioned Kenneth Franzheim and Alfred C. Finn for design and construction management of the new hall. After condemning and demolishing some houses to clear the site, Sam Houston Hall was complete within four months. The city expected 25,000 conventioneers, and the new facility was larger than Madison Square Garden. Houston spent another $100,000 for beautification, mainly with planting of gardens and trees at various public buildings and public parks. With only around 5,000 hotel rooms to lodge visitors, several hotels broke ground. Furthermore, the city organized many improvised accommodations, including campgrounds, makeshift dormitories, and converted railcars.

==Great Depression, 1929–1941==
In May 1929, a flood caused millions of damage to Houston property.

Houston&#x27;s population in 1930 was 292,352. Despite the stock market crash, Houston was still building. The Sterling Building was one of a dozen skyscrapers completed in 1930. Yet unemployment was still high and a cause for concern to Mayor Walter Monteith. Modernization of downtown continued in 1931 as two old buildings were razed: The Hotel Brazos and an old house built in 1841 came down at Louisiana and Prairie. Petroleum dominated the landscape of the Houston Ship Channel, not cotton. More dredging east of Harrisburg and new docks at the Turning Basin added to the port&#x27;s infrastructure. Several local roads were paved around this time. Air travel expanded as new passenger service began from Houston to Atlanta. Despite this economic activity, signs of the Depression included auction sales of four major downtown buildings. In December 1935, floods struck the city, causing over $1 million in property damage and killed as many as six people. Houston and the State of Texas celebrated their centennials in 1936.

Jesse H. Jones led a group of local bankers in 1931 to pool their resources in order to save the weaker banks. This was not enough to prevent the worst part of the Great Depression in 1932 and early 1933, when building activity in the private sector decreased. Federal funding from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Works Progress Administration facilitated major construction projects in the mid-1930s, including assistance for a new Houston City Hall and Lamar High School. Houston International Airport expanded commercial and passenger facilities during the 1930s, while Braniff, Eastern, and Southern airlines all offered regular service by 1941.

==World War II, 1941–1945==
When World War II started, tonnage levels fell at the port and five shipping lines ended service. April 1940 saw streetcar service replaced by buses. Robertson Stadium, then known as Houston Public School Stadium, was erected from March 1941 to September 1942. Also that year, Pan Am started air service. World War II sparked the reopening of Ellington Field. The Cruiser &quot;Houston&quot; was named after the city. It sank after a vicious battle in Java, Indonesia in 1942. August 1942 also saw the new City Manager government enacted. The M. D. Anderson Foundation formed the Texas Medical Center in 1945. That same year, the University of Houston separated from HISD and became a private university. Aircraft and shipbuilding became large industries in Texas as a result of the war. Tonnage rose after the end of the war in 1946. During the same year, E. W. Bertner gave away 161 acres (0.65 km2) of land for the Texas Medical Center. Suburban Houston came to be in the period from 1946 to 1950. When Oscar F. Holcombe took his eighth term in 1946, he abandoned a city manager type of government. Foley&#x27;s department store opened in 1947. The Alley Theatre got its first performance in 1947.
Also the same year, voters overwhelmingly rejected a referendum for citywide land-use districts--zoning. Houston carried out a large annexation campaign to increase its size. When air conditioning came to the city, it was called the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Air Conditioned City&quot;. The economy of Houston reverted to a healthy, port driven economy.

== 1950s–1960s ==
The Texas Medical Center became operational in the 1950s. The Galveston Freeway and the International Terminal at Houston International Airport (nowadays Hobby Airport) were signs of increasing wealth in the area. Millions of dollars were spent replacing aging infrastructure. In 1951, the Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital and the Shriner&#x27;s Hospital were built. Existing hospitals had expansions being completed. July 1, 1952 was the date of Houston&#x27;s first network television. Later on that same year, the University of Houston celebrated its 25th anniversary. Another problem Houston had back in the 1950s was the fact that it needed a new water supply. They at first relied on ground water, but that caused land subsidence. They had proposals in the Texas Congress to use the Trinity river. Hattie Mae White was elected to the school board in 1959. She was the first African-American to be elected in a major position in Houston in the 20th Century. Starting in 1950, Japanese-Americans as a whole were leaving horticulture and going into business in larger cities, such as Houston.
In the year 1960, Houston International Airport was deemed inadequate for the needs of the city. This airport could not be expanded, so Houston Intercontinental Airport (now George Bush Intercontinental Airport) was built north of the city. September 1961 saw Hurricane Carla, a very destructive hurricane, hit the city. On July 4, 1962, NASA opened the Manned Spacecraft Center in southeast Houston in the Clear Lake area, now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. This would bring many jobs to the Houston, especially the Clear Lake area. Also in 1962, Houston voters soundly defeated a referendum to implement zoning—the second time in fifteen years. In 1963, the University of Houston ended its status as a private institution and became a state university by entering into the Texas State System of Higher Education after a long battle with opponents from other state universities blocking the change.

In April 1965 the Astrodome opened, under the name of the Harris County Domed Stadium. In July 1965, the Houston metropolitan area was expanded by the inclusion of Brazoria County, Fort Bend County, Liberty County, and Montgomery County. AstroWorld, a theme park adjacent to the Astrodome, opened in 1968. Houston Intercontinental Airport was built in 1969. The word Houston was the first word said on the moon by American astronaut, Neil Armstrong, July 20th 1969. Houston International Airport, renamed to Hobby Airport, was closed to commercial aviation until 1971.

Barbara Jordan was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives by Houston residents on November 8, 1966.

==1970s and integration==
In the 1970s, the Chinese American community in Houston, which had been relatively small, started growing at a rapid rate.

The Sharpstown scandal, which concerned government bribes involving real estate developer Frank Sharp (neighborhood of Sharpstown is named after him) occurred in 1970 and 1971.
One Shell Plaza and Two Shell Plaza were completed in 1971. One Shell Plaza was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River. 

Because the Houston Independent School District was slow to desegregate public schools, on June 1, 1970, the Federal officials struck the HISD plan down and forced it to adopt zoning laws. This was 16 years after the landmark Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which determined that segregated schools were inherently unequal. Racial tensions over integration of the schools continued. Some Hispanic Americans felt they were being discriminated against when they were being put with only African-Americans as part of the desegregation plan, so many took their children out of the schools and put them in &quot;huelgas&quot;, or protest schools, until a ruling in 1973 satisfied their demands.

The Third Ward became the center for the African American community in the city. By 1979 African Americans were elected to the city council for the first time since Reconstruction. During the time period, five African Americans served on city council.

Water pollution of the Houston Ship Channel became notorious in 1972. Work on the Texas Commerce Tower, now the JPMorgan Chase Tower, began in 1979.

The late 1970s saw a population boom thanks to the Arab Oil Embargo. People from the Rust Belt states moved into Houston, at a rate of over 1,000 a week, mostly from Michigan, and are still moving to Houston to this day.

The city made changes in higher education. The Houston Community College system was established in 1972 by HISD. In 1977, the University of Houston celebrated its 50th anniversary as the Texas Legislature established the University of Houston System—a state system of higher education that includes and governs four universities. In 1976, Howard Hughes, at one time the world&#x27;s richest man, died on his jet heading to Houston. He was born in Humble, Texas, the home of what is now ExxonMobil.

== 1980s–1990s ==

In 1981, Kathryn J. Whitmire became the city&#x27;s first female mayor, holding that position for 10 years; after she left office, term limits were enacted to prevent future mayors from serving for more than 6 years. Several new construction projects, including The Park Shopping Mall, the Allied Bank Tower, the Gulf Tower and several other buildings were being carried out in downtown. The Transco Tower, the tallest building in the world outside of a central business district, was completed in 1983. METRO wanted to build a rail system connecting the city with the suburbs, but the plan was rejected by voters on June 11, 1983. Voters did, however, approve plans for the George R. Brown Convention Center. In August 1983, the University of Houston changed its name to &quot;University of Houston–University Park&quot; in order to separate its identity from other universities in the University of Houston System; however, the name was reverted to University of Houston in 1991. On August 18, 1983, Hurricane Alicia struck Galveston and Houston, causing $2 billion in damage.

Houston&#x27;s massive population boom was reversed when oil prices fell in 1986, leading to several years of recession for the Houston economy. The space industry also took a blow that year with the Challenger disaster in Florida. The first nine months of 1987 saw the closure of eleven banks, but also the opening of several cultural centers including the George R. Brown Convention Center, the Wortham Theatre, and the Menil Collection. On August 7, 1988, Congressman Mickey Leland died in a plane crash in Ethiopia. On October 3, a Phillips 66 plant exploded in adjacent Pasadena, killing 23 and injuring 130 people. The Houston Zoo began charging admission fees for the first time in 1988.

The year 1990 saw the opening of Houston Intercontinental Airport&#x27;s new 12-gate Mickey Leland International Airlines terminal, named after the recently deceased Houston congressman. In 1991 Sakowitz stores shut down; the Sakowitz brothers had brought their original store from Galveston to Houston in 1911. August 10, 1991 saw a redrawing of districts for city council, so that minority groups could be better represented in the city council. 1993 saw the G8 visiting to discuss world issues, and zoning was defeated for a third time by voters in November.

The master-planned community of Kingwood was forcibly annexed in 1996, angering many of its residents who often call it the &quot;Houston Anschluss&quot;. The annexation put Kingwood in the jurisdiction of Houston&#x27;s fire and police services, but it did not alter school district boundaries nor did it change postal addresses and postal services.

Rod Paige became superintendent of Houston Independent School District in 1994; during his seven-year tenure the district became very well known for high test scores, and in 2001 Paige was asked to become U.S. Secretary of Education for the new George W. Bush administration. Lee P. Brown, Houston&#x27;s first African-American mayor, was elected in 1997.

== Early 21st century ==
 
The city&#x27;s major sports teams were using outdated stadiums and threatened to leave. Eventually, in 1996, the Houston Oilers did so after several threats. The city built Enron Field (now Daikin Park) for the Houston Astros. Reliant Stadium, now NRG Stadium, was erected for the NFL expansion team Houston Texans.

Tropical Storm Allison devastated many neighborhoods as well as interrupted all services within the Texas medical center for several months with flooding in June 2001. At least 17 people were killed around the Houston area when the rainfall from Allison that fell on June 8 and 9 caused the city&#x27;s bayous to rise over their banks.

In October 2001 Enron, a Houston-based energy company, got caught in accounting scandals, ultimately leading to collapse of the company and its accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and the arrest and imprisonment of several executives.

In 2002, the University of Houston celebrated its 75th anniversary with an enrollment of 34,443 that fall semester. At the same time, the University of Houston System celebrated its 25th anniversary with a total enrollment of over 54,000.

The new international Terminal E at George Bush Intercontinental Airport opened with 30 gates in 2003.

The Toyota Center, the arena for the Houston Rockets opened in fall 2003.

METRO put in light rail service on January 1, 2004. Voters have decided by a close margin (52% Yes to 48% No) that METRO&#x27;s light rail shall be expanded.

In 2004, the Mayor of the city was Bill White and Houston unveiled the first Mahatma Gandhi statue in the state of Texas at Hermann Park. Houston&#x27;s Indian American Community were cheerful after 10 years, in 2010, when the Hillcroft and Harwin area were renamed Mahatma Gandhi District in honor of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi as that area is the center of Indian commerce.

In the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster, about 200,000 New Orleans residents resettled in Houston. Soon following Katrina was Hurricane Rita, a category 5 hurricane which caused 2.5 million Houstonians to evacuate the city, the largest urban evacuation in the history of the U.S.

Six Flags AstroWorld, Houston&#x27;s only large theme park, closed in 2005.

By 2008, the widening of I-10 was taking place, and eventually incorporated toll lanes. Also, Discovery Green park was created.

In January 2010, Annise Parker became the first openly gay mayor of a large American city upon her inauguration as Houston&#x27;s mayor.

Memorial Day storms in 2015 brought flash flooding to the city as some areas received 11 inches or more of rain overnight, exacerbated by already full bayous. At least three people died and more than 1,000 cars were stranded on highways and overpasses.

In April 2016, historic flooding came to Houston which has killed 5 people.

In August 2017, Houston experienced record flooding as a result of Hurricane Harvey. It caused $125 billion dollars in damage, making it one of three tropical cyclones to cause over $100 billion in damages, along with Ian and Katrina.

==History==
The area of Hitoyoshi was part of ancient Higo Province. From the Kamakura period it was under the control of the Sagara clan, which continued to rule as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Hitoyoshi Domain through the end of the Edo Period. Hitoyoshi Castle and much of the castle town were destroyed in a fire in 1862. The town of Hitoyoshi was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On February 11, 1942 Hitoyoshi merged with the villages of Nishise, Nakahara, and Aida to form the city of Hitoyoshi. 

==Government==
Hitoyoshi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 18 members. Hitoyoshi contributes one member to the Kumamoto Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Kumamoto 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

Hitoyoshi is a regional commercial center and transportation hub. Important sectors of the local economy include tourism, agriculture, and sake brewing.

== Commerce ==
Hitoyoshi&#x27;s main product is rice &quot;shōchū&quot; (an indigenous spirit distilled from rice), or &quot;kuma-shōchū&quot;, which is the official name of rice shōchū produced in Kumamoto&#x27;s Hitoyoshi and Kuma District. This shōchū must be produced in these areas from Japanese rice and with water from the Kuma River, which runs through the town. The World Trade Organization granted &quot;kuma-shōchū&quot; geographical indication status in 1994. The most popular brand is Hakutake Shiro, which currently holds 50% market share on all rice shōchū sold in Japan. However, Takahashi Distillery, the producer of Hakutake Shiro, is just one of 28 distilleries in Hitoyoshi in the surrounding region that produce &quot;kuma-shōchū&quot;.

<doc id="329618" wikidata="Q386110" url="?curid=329618" title="Minamata, Kumamoto">
<text>is a city located in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. It is on the west coast of Kyūshū and faces Amakusa islands. Minamata was established as a village in 1889, re-designated as a town in 1912 and grew into a city in 1949. As of March 2017, the city has an estimated population of 25,310 and a population density of 160 persons per km2. The total area is 162.88 km2.

Minamata is known due to Minamata disease, a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning. The disease was discovered in 1956. A local chemical plant was blamed for causing the disease by emitting untreated wastewater into Minamata Bay.

Lately, Minamata has focused on becoming a model environmental city. In 1999, the city obtained the ISO 14001 certification for Environmental Management. In 2001, Minamata became an official Japanese Eco-town. In 2004 and 2005, Minamata won the Japanese Top Eco-City contest.

==Minamata environmental disaster==
===History===

The city is best known as the former site of an environmental disaster caused by industrial pollution of the bay with mercury. From 1932 to 1968, the chemical company Chisso discharged effluent containing methyl mercury from their plant in Minamata. Methyl mercury contaminated Minamata Bay and accumulated in fish, which were then consumed by the local population.

In 1968 the discharge of poisonous effluent was ceased due to discontinuation of acetaldehyde production at the Chisso factory. However, the sea sediment as well as fish remained contaminated and so measures were taken to counteract the effects. In 1975, the bay was fenced by fishing nets. A sludge dredging project was initiated in 1977 and continued until 1990. During the project, 784,000m3 of sludge was dredged and 582,000 m2 of land was reclaimed. On July 29, 1997, a Minamata Bay Safety Declaration was issued, nets had been removed and the environment was pronounced safe.

By 2007, a total of 2,668 people were certified as Minamata disease patients, 639 of whom are alive today. Since Minamata mercury contamination event, the toxic burden of anthropogenic mercury (Hg) pollution for human and ecosystem health is globally accepted by policymakers and resulted in the UNEP Minamata Convention.

=== Legacy ===
The first patient with previously unseen neurological symptoms was reported in Minamata in 1956. In 1959, a researcher from Kumamoto University suspected that an organomercury compound could be the cause. However, paths of transformation of inorganic to organic mercury were unknown or uncertain at that time and so the effluent from Chisso was not identified as the sought source. It took 9 more years until the government officially acknowledged mercury-containing effluent from local acetaldehyde chemical plants to be the cause of Minamata disease. Since then, victims of Minamata disease have been compensated by Chisso and both local and national governments, due to the lawsuits won and official relief programs.

The 1970 session of the Japanese Diet became remembered as the &quot;Pollution Diet,&quot; as the Japanese government took action under the pressure of civil society movements provoked by Minamata disease as well as other two major environmental catastrophes - Yokkaichi Asthma and Itai-itai disease. Fourteen new environmental laws were passed in a single session, giving Japan what at the time were the most stringent environmental protection laws in the world. These new laws included a Water Pollution Act and nationwide regulations of toxic discharges. The polluter pays principle was introduced. A national Environmental Agency, which later developed into the Ministry of Environment, was founded in 1971. National governmental expenditures on environmental issues almost doubled between 1970 and 1975 and tripled on the local government level. Business investments in clean technologies rose dramatically, too.

Minamata disease attracted global attention in 1972 during the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm. The official report presented to the Conference by the Japanese government did not mention the disease at all; this lack of honesty resulted in a second report being put together by Japanese citizens. Minamata disease patients were sent to Stockholm to hand in the citizens&#x27; report. Evidence of the misery caused by heavy environmental pollution revealed the downside of Japan&#x27;s post-war rapid economic development to the global public.

In 1978, the National Institute for Minamata Disease was established in Minamata. It consists of four departments: The Department of Basic Medical Science, The Department of Clinical Medicine, The Department of Epidemiology and The Department of International Affairs and Environmental Sciences. In 1986, The Institute became a WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Health Effects of Mercury Compounds. The Institute seeks to improve medical treatment of Minamata disease patients and conducts research on mercury compounds and their impact on organisms as well as potential detoxification mechanisms. In April, 2008 the Institute invented a method for adsorbing gaseous mercury in order to prevent air pollution and enable recycling of the metal. For an overview of research in 2012, see website list of research

Despite the fact that anti-pollution measures and patient-support programmes started in the 1970s, it took four more decades for the Government to fully admit responsibility and apologize on-site; on 1May 2010 Prime Minister Hatoyama was the first Prime Minister to participate in a yearly-held Memorial Service for the Victims of Minamata Disease and to so demonstrate regret on behalf of the national government.

==Minamata Eco-Town==
Minamata Eco-Town constitutes a set of environmental goals and initiatives, which seek to turn the town&#x27;s negative legacy into a positive present and future. 
The idea dates back to 1992. In that year, the municipal government of Minamata announced &quot;Moyai Naoshi&quot; (meaning &quot;Repairing social bonds&quot;) - a policy to amend relations between victims of the Minamata Disease and the other citizens and to give an end to prevailing social divisions. On 1 April 1992 the first Memorial Service for the Victims of Minamata Disease was organized and has taken place annually ever since. Moreover, the Minamata Disease Municipal Museum was founded in January 1993 in order to collect, preserve and pass on information about the disease and related issues. Apart from exhibitions, the Museum offers story-telling sessions by Minamata disease patients. Additional Minamata Disease archives were opened in 2001.

In respect of envisaged sustainable development, the municipal government addressed environmental challenges along the social ones; A Declaration of the Construction of Eco-City Model was launched in 1992. Subsequently, waste separation by citizens became one of the key activities; today, 24 different kinds of waste are separated. A Prize for the Environment was established to promote sustainability across Japan and South-East Asia and a prefectural environmental centre was built in Minamata.

Other major events and achievements:
* In 1996, an International Environment Forum was held in Minamata Cultural Hall. The topic was &quot;Creating a city that is kind to the environment&quot;
* In 1997, Minamata Bay Safety Declaration was issued and no more restrictions on fishing or consuming fish were valid
* In 1999, Minamata City Hall was certified with ISO 14001, so was the local chemical plant of Chisso
* In 2001, Minamata became an officially recognized Japanese Eco-Town
* In 2008, Kumamoto Toa IWD, after years of protests and civil resistance, withdrew a plan to build a landfill for industrial waste in the mountains near Minamata City

Currently, Minamata employs a plan of reducing greenhouse gases by 32% in 2020 and by 50% in 2050 compared to 2005. Four major target areas are designated to achieve these reductions: Activities for Environmentally Friendly Living, Development of Environmentally Friendly Industries, Development of a Nature-oriented Ecological Town, Development of The City for Environmental Learning.

=== Activities for environmentally friendly living ===
This target area has three main goals:
* Promotion of the reduction, separation and recycling of household garbage
* Promotion of ISO throughout the city
* Eco-Shop Certification system (Environmental Master Certification)

==== Garbage collection ====
Since August 1993, in order to promote recyclable household garbage through sorting, the residents of Minamata City have planned (before any other city in Japan) a detailed garbage classification system; garbage was divided into 21 categories in the fiscal year 1999, and has now reached 24 categories. The City has set up 300 garbage collection stations around the City. Each area&#x27;s assigned recycling volunteers take turn in groups of two or three to assist the residents who bring in garbage for sorting out recyclable materials by themselves. Once a month the residents work together to classify garbage, an activity which revives the community spirit, and creates a place for residents to get together. Profits from the sale of recyclable garbage are distributed to each district according to the weight of each district&#x27;s recyclable garbage; large districts receive up to 600,000 yen a year and smaller districts about 70,000-80,000 yen. Besides classification, the Recycling Volunteers Committee promotes Taking-Back-Home- Garbage Campaign, Recycling Campaign, and organizes recycling fairs such as flea markets where reusable goods are sold.

==== Women&#x27;s Liaison Meeting for Reducing Waste ====
Because of its effort to classify garbage, Minamata City has successfully reduced its waste output significantly, from 10,000 tons in 1992 to 8,000 tons in 1994. However, it has become necessary to move beyond garbage classification to garbage reduction due to increasing garbage generation. As a result, in December 1997, 16 women&#x27;s groups, which have great interest in waste reduction, met together and organized the &quot;Women&#x27;s Liaison Conference on Waste Garbage&quot; with the slogan of &quot;Let&#x27;s reduce the increasing garbage from each household!&quot; They actively encourage residents not to bring home items that are not absolutely required which may result in waste, to repair broken items and to buy recycled products when possible. Major activities of &quot;Women&#x27;s Liaison Meeting for Reducing Waste&quot; are:
* Concluded &quot;Agreement on Abolition of Plastic Food Trays&quot; with four large retailers in the city. Plastic food trays were prohibited in the sale of 65 items (September 1998). Sales activities have been monitored on a regular basis since then.
* Engaged in the distribution of free &quot;shopping bags&quot; to households to reduce the use of plastic bags offered at cash registers (November to December 1998).
* Prompted one of the large retailers to introduce a point-card system for clients coming with their own shopping bags.
* Supported the establishment of the Eco-Shop Certification System and engaged in examination (since April 1999).
* Engaged in family ISO certification examination (since October 1999)

==== Promoting ISO ====
The municipal office of Minamata City obtained ISO 14001, international standard for environmental management, in February 1999. Under the system, the city intends to redouble efforts for the realization of &quot;an environmental model city&quot; making the most of the lessons from Minamata disease and fulfill the roles local governments should play in the preservation and revival of the global environment. There were multiple effects the city hoped to achieve with the implementation of ISO throughout the city:
* A significant step for Minamata City to be recognized by everybody as an international environmental model city.
* Improvement of the regional image (may give favorable effects at the Local Government Environmental Council, Mansfield Environment International Conference in 2000, Mercury International Meeting in 2001, etc.)
* Reduction of costs through energy and resource saving, including lower costs of electricity and paper used at the municipal office and related facilities.
* Changes of ideas on environment and progress in activities of staff members.
* Rationalization of administration and progress of reform as a result of the introduction of the system.
* Improvement of ideas and influence on concrete activities of citizens as a result of the acquisition of environmental ISO by the municipal office.
* Support of small enterprises in the city in the acquisition of environmental ISO.

==== Eco-Shop Certification system ====
Minamata City established a system for certifying craftsmen who attach much importance to the environment in their production activities. This is called the Environment Master System, and commenced in fiscal 1998, before any other city in Japan. This is to improve the status and consciousness of craftsman and promote the creation of safe and sound commodities in consideration of environment and health, reflecting their experience with Minamata disease. In the first year, fiscal 1998, nine craftsmen engaged in the activities of paper making, and the production of tea leaves, bread, tangerine oranges, vegetables, rice or eggs were certified. In fiscal 1999, five craftsmen including a tatami-maker were additionally certified, making the current total of certified environmental masters fourteen. All of them produce products with confidence and pay careful attention to the environment in every part of their processes, including materials selection, production, processing, selling, and disposal of waste. &quot;Products produced by environmental masters&quot; mean safe and sound products certified by the municipal office. For some time in the past, Minamata-made products were not favorably accepted on the market due to the bad image of the city. Nonetheless, people in Minamata have learned through experience the dreadfulness of environmental pollution and because of this, they can now produce truly safe and harmless products. Before the establishment of the master system, Minamata products were simply products produced with confidence by people who were particularly concerned about the environment. In the future, however, they will be traded as brand products produced by the renowned environmental masters of Minamata City. There are six qualification criteria to become an environmental master:

# Have been engaged in production in consideration of environment and health for 5 years or longer.
# Have experience in production in consideration of environment and health, including the use of natural materials and elimination of chemicals
# Have detailed knowledge, experience, technology, etc. in relation to production in consideration of environment and health.
# Engaged in activities in relation to the preservation of the local environment.
# Have detailed knowledge about environmental problems and preservation.
# Have detailed knowledge upon pollution, including the Minamata disease.

=== Development of environmentally friendly industries ===
Minamata tries to develop environmentally friendly industries with three goals. The first topic is producing biomass energy from regional resources. The resources they want to use are citrus fruit, bamboo and food waste, to produce bio-ethanol and E3. But in the environmental report of the city from 2011. It is not stated that biomass energy is used and most of the energy is purchased (48%) or made from oil (44%). In January 2012 a test facility to make Bio-ethanol from bamboo was opened with a capacity of 100.000 kilolitres/year capacity. The facility will run for the remainder of 2012 to consider the feasibility of the process.

The second goal is to have safe and reliable production in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The emphasis in this project is on local food production to reduce food mileage. Local agriculture produces mostly rice, mandarins and local salad onions. After the Minamata disease scandal local farmers wanted to show that their products were safe, so they changed their way of production by: not using pesticides anymore, use 70% less fertilizer and instead started using a special fertilizer from Chisso. In the 2011 environmental report the local production was stable for the last 10 years and the advice was to promote local production. Fishing was not possible from 1970 till 1997, because the bay was closed with a net to prevent the catching of contaminated fish. During this period fishers were compensated by the local government. When the nets were removed sardine catching started to flourish and there now are full-time and part-time fishers, who combine fishing with other jobs.

Finally the last goal for the industry is Development of a Second Eco-Industrial Housing Complex. With this program the city wants to build an industrial park mostly filled with companies that focus on the environment and the park is now filled with companies like:
* Act-be Recycling a company that dismantles TVs, air conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators.
* Tanaka a glass recycling company that reuses used bottles and makes paving out of the unused ones, with a capacity of 8 million bottles per year.
* RBS a company that makes fertilizer from sewage and other materials.
* Repla-tec recycle waste plastic into resin for furthering manufacturing purposes, accepts all waste plastic from Minamata City.
* Minamata Environmental Technology Center is a research center that researches and promotes technology transfer with an environmental benefit.
* Kiraku Mining Industries recycles waste oils into low-sulfur heavy oil that can be reused.
* Southern Kyushu Tire Recycling collects old tires and makes rubber powder feedstock out of them or other new rubber products

The different companies in the park vary in size and capacity and some companies only process products from Minamata city, while others process products from the region or the country. Part of this park is made possible by subsidies.

=== Development of a nature-oriented ecological town ===
Natural environment preservation sector:

Goals:
* Strengthening relations with the central town
* Support for activities in mountainous and coastal areas
* Cultivation of water resources and forests by the residents, revitalization of the sea
* Accelerate the absorption of carbon dioxide
* Use of natural energy

District Environmental Agreement System:

There are 26 districts within the city of Minamata. Each district develops their own environmental agreement system by allowing the local residents to establish &quot;lifestyle rules&quot; for their district. The Kagumeishi District Residents&#x27; Association (Environment Department) has developed one of the most extensive environmental agreement systems seen below:
* We will preserve the waterfront, rivers and streamside forests, the habitats of fireflies and dragonflies.
* We will not pollute water resources and will preserve riverside scenery.
* We will ensure that districts save clean water
* As a rule, unless an agreement is made by Kagumeishi District, we prohibit quarrying in forests due to the risk of rock-falls, the outflow of soil and landslides. Quarrying from valleys is also prohibited to prevent the landscape from being spoiled and the outflow of soil caused by freshets.
* We will reduce the amount of household garbage and try to recycle it.
* We will reduce over-packaging and try to take as little waste home as possible.
* Under the slogan &quot;mottainai&quot; we will try to use things for as long as possible by repairing them.
* When we dispose of recyclable garbage, we will make sure to separate it based on city guidelines.
* We will make compost from garbage.
* We will take care not to cause disasters when we construct roads or cut down trees in the mountains.
* We will guard the districts against illegal dumping.

Creating an Environmentally Symbiotic Region:

Part of the goal of Minamata becoming an eco town is to maximize, protect, and integrate the town with the environment. Programs to foster and maintain ecosystems began in 1998. One specific goal is to have forests cover 75% of the city area. Other generalized goals serve to maintain and improve absorption levels of carbon dioxide, and revitalize the sea with abundant marine plant life. Several districts have implemented projects to help create an environmentally symbiotic region:
* Creating eco-tourism.
* Building terraced fields with flowers and fruit.
* Management of &quot;Citizens Forest&quot; and expansion of forest lands.
* Cultivation of seaweed (kelp) and the reconstruction of kelp farms.

Utilizing New and Natural Energy:

Minamata is striving to implement new and natural energy measures. 
Sources of natural energy: wind and solar. Wind and solar energy is mostly used for providing energy for buildings and infrastructure.
Sources of new energy: bioethanol from bamboo, citrus fruit extract, thinned wood, and other plants. Bioethanol is mostly used for transportation and shipping. JNC Corp is one such bioethanol plant that was established in early 2012 that will produce 100,000 kiloliters/ year of bioethanol from bamboo.

=== Development of The City for Environmental Learning ===
In this target area, Minamata eco-town committed itself to the four following goals:
* Publishing the lessons of Minamata disease.
* Promoting effects inside and outside by developing personnel.
* Developing of a base for environmental learning.
* Establishment of natural environmental learning and excursion programs.

In 1998, Minamata City set up an original certification system to support producers, which is called the &quot;Environmental Meister Programme&quot;. The &quot;Environmental Meister Programme&quot; certification focuses on environment and health, but not on a specific field of production, which is quite unique. This system guarantees that certain products are safe to use.

In 2000, Minamata City obtained ISO14001 certification to reduce environmental burdens
associated with service businesses for citizens. The city drew up a version of ISO, for various service businesses for citizens, such as an office, home, preschool and hotel. The city has the authority to do the assessment, the certification and the promotion of the ISOs.

All of the 16 elementary and junior high schools in the city work on the school version of ISO to achieve the following goals:
* To conserve and pass on to the future generations the beautiful sea, mountains, rivers and air of Minamata.
* To grow the spirit to be proud of their home Minamata.
* To cooperate in family and community activities.

At the first school that implemented the school version of environmental ISO, teachers and students made an action plan. Every two weeks, they reflect on their conduct, in order to achieve a lifestyle by which they can conserve and improve the environment. The aim of this project is to make the actions as practical as possible, so children can easily implement that in their everyday life.

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) established a training program in which participants can learn the lessons of Minamata. At the end of the program, the participants are expected to achieve the following:
* Being able to explain how serious, how difficult to overcome, and how important to prevent pollution damages through learning experiences of Minamata City and Japan.
* Being able to explain approaches towards sustainable society through collaboration with residents, enterprises, and governments, following Minamata City as a model.
* Being able to explain how local governments promote environmental mind, and how they collaborate with community to conduct environmental education.
* Being able to explain environmental policies in corresponding governorates.

In Minamata itself, there are several environmental learning programs. At the Kumamato Prefecture Environmental Center, visitors can gain knowledge and understanding about environmental problems at facilities. This program focuses on daily life. There is also a program about aquatic environment, a program about pollution in rivers and several programs regarding recycling.

<doc id="329619" wikidata="Q1133638" url="?curid=329619" title="Rose Parade">
<text>The Rose Parade, also known as the Tournament of Roses Parade (or simply the Tournament of Roses), is an annual parade held mostly along Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California, United States, on New Year&#x27;s Day (or on Monday, January 2 if New Year&#x27;s Day falls on a Sunday).

Produced by the non-profit Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, the parade usually starts at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC–8), and includes flower-covered floats, marching bands, and equestrian units. The parade is followed in the afternoon by the Rose Bowl, one of the major bowl games in college football. It has been uninterrupted except during World War II in 1942, 1943, and 1945, and in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

First held on January 1, 1890, the Rose Parade is watched by hundreds of thousands of spectators. The Rose Bowl college football game was added in 1902 to help fund the cost of staging the parade. Since 2011, Honda has been a presenting sponsor of the Rose Parade. Accordingly, the company has the parade&#x27;s first float, which like all floats, follows the parade&#x27;s theme.

==History==

Members of Pasadena&#x27;s Valley Hunt Club first staged the parade in 1890. Since then the parade has been held in Pasadena every New Year&#x27;s Day, except when January 1 falls on a Sunday. In that case, it is held on the subsequent Monday, January 2. This exception was instituted in 1893, as organizers did not wish to disturb horses hitched outside Sunday church services.

Many of the members of the Valley Hunt Club were former residents of the American East and Midwest. They wished to showcase their new California home&#x27;s mild winter weather. At a club meeting, Professor Charles F. Holder announced, &quot;In New York, people are buried in the snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let&#x27;s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.&quot;

So the club organized horse-drawn carriages covered in flowers, followed by foot races, polo matches, and a game of tug-of-war on the town lot that attracted a crowd of 2,000 to the event. Upon seeing the scores of flowers on display, the professor decided to suggest the name &quot;Tournament of Roses.&quot;

Over the next few founding years, the parade added marching bands and motorized floats. By 1895, the event was too large for the Valley Hunt Club to handle, resulting in the formation of an ad hoc non-profit organization – the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association. By the 11th annual tournament (1900), the town lot on which the activities were held was renamed Tournament Park, a large open area directly adjacent to Pasadena&#x27;s world-famous institution of higher learning, Caltech. Activities soon included ostrich races, bronco busting demonstrations, and an odd novelty race between a camel and an elephant. (The elephant won the race.) Soon reviewing stands were built along the parade route and newspapers in Eastern Seaboard cities started to take notice of the event.

The stately Italian Renaissance-style mansion of William Wrigley Jr. (the maker of Wrigley&#x27;s chewing gum) was offered to the city of Pasadena after Mrs. Wrigley&#x27;s death in 1958, under the condition that their home would be the Rose Parade&#x27;s permanent headquarters. Tournament House is the name given to the former home where the organization is headquartered.

The first associated football game was played on January 1, 1902. Originally titled the &quot;Tournament East-West football game,&quot; it is considered to be the first Rose Bowl. The next game was not played until New Year&#x27;s Day 1916; they have been played annually since then. The game derives its modern name from Rose Bowl Stadium, which was built for the 1923 game.

In 2002 and 2006 (when the Rose Bowl Game was the BCS National Championship Game), the &quot;Granddaddy of &#x27;em all&quot; was not held the same day as the parade; the 2002 game was played on January 3, the 2006 game was played on January 4. Not all fans were pleased with the change; some thought the atmosphere and tradition of the Rose Bowl was lost. Once the BCS title game was separated from the host bowl, it no longer affected the date of the Rose Bowl Game (even when the title game returned to Pasadena in 2010 and 2014).

Since the mid-1990&#x27;s, a flyover by the Northrop B-2 Spirit signals the start of the parade to showcase the capabilities of the United States Air Force preceded by a musical performance. Since 2019, the parade concludes with a special guest doing the ceremonial forward pass from the parade to the Rose Bowl followed by a musical performance.

On July 15, 2020, it was announced that the Rose Parade for 2021 would be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was assessed under current conditions that the construction of floats for the parade could not be performed in a safe manner, while the event itself (due to large crowds and outside visitors) was also considered to be at a high risk of causing more instances of COVID-19 infections. The parade was deferred to 2022. However, the parade number was still changed; what would have been called the 132nd parade officially became the 133rd parade.

On November 13, 2020, it was announced that a TV special titled &quot;The Rose Parade&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Celebration&quot; would take the parade&#x27;s place and premiere on January 1, 2021.

==Description==

The Tournament of Roses Parade has followed the same route mainly following Colorado Boulevard (Pasadena&#x27;s main thoroughfare and a segment of the former US 66) for many decades. The day before the parade, the entire environs of the neighborhood streets south of the intersection of Orange Grove Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard are sealed off and reserved for the marshaling of the dozens of floats, bands, equestrian units, and other elements. This sealed-off section acts as the &quot;Formation Area&quot;, and the Formation Area Committee manages it.

On parade morning the various elements are merged and dispatched in front of Tournament House. The parade starts heading north on South Orange Grove Boulevard beginning at Green Street. At Colorado Boulevard it passes the main grandstands (and the main television and media stands) and proceeds east on Colorado Boulevard. The parade then turns north on Sierra Madre Boulevard. The floats then must travel under the Sierra Madre Boulevard/I-210 freeway overpass, requiring over-height floats to reduce their height. The parade ends at Paloma Street near Victory Park and Pasadena High School. Floats continue into the Post-Parade viewing area (which is open that afternoon and the following day). In total this route is long; the assembled bands, horse units, and floats take approximately two hours to pass by.

===Recent parades===

The 2009 parade featured 46 floats, including some new entries, such as Jack in the Box&#x27;s &quot;Jack-O-Licious&quot;, City of Mission Viejo&#x27;s &quot;Making a Splash&quot;, RFD-TV&#x27;s &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, and the City of Roseville&#x27;s &quot;Entertaining Dreams for a Century&quot;.

The 2010 parade saluted the men and women serving America throughout the world with a flyover at the beginning of the parade by four F/A-18 jets (performed by pilots of Strike Fighter Squadron 22, the &quot;Fighting Redcocks&quot;) from the Naval Air Station at Lemoore, California).

KC and the Sunshine Band were featured on Stella Rosa Wine&#x27;s &quot;Stellabrate Good Times&quot; float. Performing on the e-Harmony float was Natalie Cole, singing &quot;This Will Be&quot;. NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot; joined this parade too, along with Daryl Hall and the Harlem Globetrotters. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation float (&quot;Living the Dream: Love Is the Best Protection&quot;) featured a wedding of a California couple, Aubrey Loots and Danny Leclair; some people called for a boycott of the parade as the couple are actually both men.

==Floats==


Originally the parade featured flower-decorated horse carriages. Over time, floats built by volunteers from sponsoring communities supplanted the carriages. Currently, most are built by professional float building companies and take nearly a year to construct. Some communities and organizational sponsors still rely on volunteers. The Valley Hunt Club still enters a flower-decorated carriage. The Cal Poly Universities Rose Float still relies solely on students who volunteer, with the present day requirement that &quot;every inch of every float must be covered with flowers or other natural materials, such as leaves, seeds or bark&quot;. Floats are self-propelled on (generally used-up) truck chassis in contrast to the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade which uses trailer-based floats pulled by new, intact (sponsor-provided) trucks.

Typically 48 to 72 hours before parade day, one can view several of the floats being decorated with flowery mantles in the various &#x27;float barns&#x27; that dot the Arroyo Seco / Rose Bowl area in West Pasadena, not far from the start of the parade. It is a rule of the parade that all surfaces of the float framework must be covered in natural materials (such as flowers, plants, seaweeds, seeds, bark, vegetables, or nuts, for example); furthermore, no artificial flowers or plant material are allowed, nor can the materials be artificially colored. Last-minute volunteer opportunities are usually available.

There are 6 &quot;Self-Built&quot; Floats: Cal Poly Universities, City of Burbank, City of Downey, City of La Canada Flintridge, City of Sierra Madre, and City of South Pasadena. Additionally, there have been a variety of commercial float builders, who, as of 2025, include Artistic Entertainment Services (AES) and Phoenix Decorating Company. Previous professional builders include Fiesta Parade Floats (1988-2024), Paradiso Parade Floats (2012-2018), and Charisma Floats &amp; Designs (1987-2011).

Anaheim city&#x27;s float at the 2008 Rose Parade included the Stanley Cup that the NHL&#x27;s Anaheim Ducks had won in 2007, hoisted by player Brad May. (As the regulations state that the outside of the float must exclusively use organic material, ABC commentators speculated that the city got an exception to display the Cup.) Also, the Los Angeles Dodgers had a float in celebration of the franchise&#x27;s 50th anniversary in Los Angeles, with Hall of Fame sportscasters Vin Scully and Jaime Jarrin as well as former players Steve Garvey, Fernando Valenzuela, Eric Karros, and Nomar Garciaparra.

The 2010 parade floats included the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s 100th Anniversary float, the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles in celebration of Mexico&#x27;s bicentennial of independence, and &quot;Safety Harbor Kids&quot;. The 2010 parade also featured a float from Dick Van Patten&#x27;s Natural Balance Pet Foods, which set a Guinness world record for the longest single-chassis float. The City of West Covina paid tribute to the &quot;service and commitment of the Tuskegee Airmen&quot; with a float entitled &quot;Tuskegee Airmen – A Cut Above&quot;, which featured a large bald eagle, two replica World War II &quot;Redtails&quot; fighter planes, and historical images of some of the airmen who served our country. The float won the Mayor&#x27;s trophy as the most outstanding city entry – national or international, also Anaheim float featured the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game that was played at Angel Stadium of Anaheim, four former MLB All-Stars, pitchers Mark Langston, Chuck Finley, and Troy Percival, along with second baseman Bobby Grich were aboard.

Since January 1, 2012, fell on a Sunday, tradition dictated that the parade would be held on Monday, January 2, 2012. The 2012 Rose Parade had 43 floats, featuring the Honda float featuring Grammy Award-winning musician Kenny G aboard, the LMU Centennial Celebration float, and the Girl Scouts of the USA 100th Anniversary float (entitled &quot;What Will You Do Today?&quot;). Float builder Fiesta Floats donated their services to the design of the Girl Scouts float, which was decorated by the organization&#x27;s volunteers (of all ages). Paramount Pictures also participated in the 2012 parade with its centennial celebration float &quot;100 Years of Movie Magic&quot;. Namco Bandai Games joined the parade for the first time, commemorating the Power Rangers. Others were Microsoft Kinect (&quot;You are the Controller&quot;) and the Kit-Cat Klock (&quot;Timeless Fun for Everyone&quot;).

The floats compete for one of 24 awards selected by three judges each year. Since Honda became the title sponsor, its floats are not eligible to compete for an award.

After the parade, the floats are parked at the end of the parade route on Sierra Madre Boulevard and Washington Boulevard, near Victory Park and are on display for a day and a half (two-and-a-half days when January 1 falls on Friday) after the parade. None of the float riders or dignitaries/celebrities involved in the parade are present, and animated features on some floats are not activated. Admission to the viewing area is $13 and children are admitted free.

The 2018 Rose Parade was the last parade for the city of Los Angeles after 122 consecutive years sponsoring floats for the Rose Parade. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was aboard the float titled &quot;Everyone is Welcome&quot;.

==Equestrians==

Prior to the parade an &quot;Equestfest&quot; is held at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center to showcase the performances by the talented riding teams. Equestrian units taking part in &quot;Equestfest&quot; have included the Clydesdales of the U.S. Army&#x27;s First Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, &quot;Traveler&quot; (the USC mascot), the Sons and Daughters of the Reel West, and the California State Fire Fighters Association.

==Bands==
Top marching bands from all over the world are invited. Many of the nation&#x27;s top high school marching bands, along with college and organizational marching bands participate.

The bands participating in the parade have developed traditions throughout its history. For example, Pasadena City College&#x27;s Tournament of Roses Honor Band always marches in the Rose Parade, along with the Los Angeles Unified School District All City Honor Band, all of whom are selected by audition the previous autumn. Positions in both bands are coveted, and those selected are among the best student musicians in California.

The Tournament of Roses Honor Band&#x27;s Herald Trumpets unit marches and plays directly before the Rose Queen&#x27;s float. Nine trumpet players and one snare drummer are selected from those who audition for the band for the unit.

University marching bands from the two schools competing in the Rose Bowl Game are invited to march in the parade. They typically accompany the float that represents the school and conference.
Bands that have a long-standing arrangement to be in the parade include:
* The official Tournament of Roses Honor Band hosted by Pasadena City College consisting of members of the college&#x27;s Lancer Marching Band and talented high school musicians from throughout California (89th Rose Parade appearance in 2018).
* The Los Angeles Unified School District All City Honor Band
* The Salvation Army Tournament of Roses Marching Band consisting of local and visiting Salvation Army musicians (103rd appearance in 2023). The Salvation Army band has performed more than any band in the parade.
* The United States Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band

In 1891, the Monrovia Town Band was the first musical group to perform in the Rose Parade. In 1998, the Washington Township High School Minutemen Marching Band from Sewell, New Jersey became the first band in the history of the Rose Parade to decorate its entire ranks with live flowers, in keeping with the practice of decorating the parade floats. From the neighboring town of Arcadia, the Arcadia High School Apache Marching Band and Colorguard has appeared for 15 years, returning about every four years. The Allen Eagle Escadrille from Allen, Texas had a record breaking 780 members in the 2016 Rose Parade.

In addition to the parade, the bands participate in a two-day, three-show Bandfest at Pasadena City College&#x27;s Jackie and Mack Robinson Stadium, usually on December 29 and 30 (December 30 and 31 when the parade is on January 2). Number of the bands also perform at other Southern California venues.

==Theme==

Shortly after the parade in January, the newly elected President of the Tournament of Roses has the duty of picking a theme for the forthcoming festivities. Most of the floral floats in the parade are inspired by this theme.

On January 19, 2023, Pasadena attorney Alex Aghajanian was confirmed as President of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association for 2023–2024. He announced that the theme for the 135th Rose Parade and the 110th Rose Bowl game would be &quot;Celebrating a World of Music: The Universal Language&quot;. The Tournament of Roses President will lead the 14-member Executive Committee and the organization of 935 volunteer members for the upcoming year.

==Grand Marshal==
The Grand Marshal of the parade is an honorary position selected by the president of the Tournament. Many are picked for a relationship to the theme that is also picked by the president. Traditionally, the Grand Marshal of the parade also participates in the Coin Toss during the Rose Bowl.

The 2022 Grand Marshal was actor LeVar Burton.

Vin Scully was chosen as the Grand Marshal of the 2014 parade and Rose Bowl Game. Previously, President Sally Bixby named Jane Goodall as the Grand Marshal for the 2013 parade, succeeding J. R. Martinez, the 2012 grand marshal.

==Rose Queen and Rose Court==
Each September, some 1,000 young women (and a few young men) between the ages of 17 and 25 interview to serve as a member of the Tournament of Roses Rose Court. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses administers a selection process to determine which greater Pasadena-area young women will have the honor of being crowned Queen of the Tournament of Roses, or more commonly known as &quot;Rose Queen.&quot; In addition to one Rose Queen, six Rose Princesses will also be selected to make up the Rose Court. The Rose Court will then ride on a specially-designed float in the Rose Parade and will also preside over the Rose Bowl Game. The Rose Court will also attend over one hundred events in the Southern California area as ambassadors of the Tournament of Roses. 

Residency for the Rose Queen and Court hopefuls include the Pasadena City College district and starting with the 2025 Rose Parade and thereafter, the cities of Alhambra and San Gabriel and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Eagle Rock, Highland Park, Monterey Hills and El Sereno, which are served by the Los Angeles Community College District.

&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and &quot;Chicago P.D.&quot; actress Sophia Bush was Rose Queen in 2000. 1997 Rose Princess Lisa Remillard is an anchor with San Diego&#x27;s KUSI television station.

The 2015 Rose Queen was Madison Triplett (John Marshall Fundamental High School). Members of the Royal Court were Mackenzie Byers (Pasadena City College), Gabrielle Current (Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy), Veronica Mejia (Pasadena City College), Bergen Onufer (Mayfield Senior School), Simona Shao (Westridge School) and Emily Stoker (Temple City High School).

The 2019 Royal Court consisted of Louise Siskel, Rucha Kadam, Helen Rossi, Lauren Baydaline, Sherry Ma, Ashley Hackett, and Micaele McElrath.

As there was no parade in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no Rose Queen crowned for that year. Before that, the last time that a Rose Queen was not crowned was 1929.

The Royal Court for the 2022 Rose Parade was announced on October 4, 2021, by Dr. Robert Miller, the president of the Tournament of Roses Association.

==Attendance==

More recent attendance figures are followed by the TV and predicted attendance in parentheses. Most estimates are conducted by the Tournament of Roses and the Pasadena Police Department. A number of studies were conducted by the Anderson School of Management at UCLA on attendance and economic impact to Southern California. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ran a study in 1980 that said the actual attendance at the parade was actually about 60% of what is claimed each year.
* 1890 – 2,000
* 2002 – 800,000 (1,000,000; drop blamed on the September 11 attacks)
* 2004 – 1,000,000
* 2009 – 700,000 (Pasadena had 1,000,000 visitors during the week of the parade)
* 2011 – 700,000
* 2012 – 700,000 (with an estimated 70 million watching worldwide on television)
* 2013 – 700,000
* 2022 – 700,000
* 2024 – (750,000)

==Broadcast==
The Rose Parade is televised on ABC, NBC, Univision (in Spanish), HGTV, Sky Link TV (in Mandarin and Cantonese), Hallmark Channel, RFD TV, and KTLA (the latter three offer interruption-free coverage, although KTLA continues to repeat the parade throughout the day with commercials, and starting 2020 it has been livestreamed on its YouTube page). WGN-TV in Chicago carried KTLA&#x27;s uninterrupted coverage of the 2009 parade (WGN and KTLA have historically been sister stations via former owner Tribune Media; both are now owned by Nexstar Media Group). Until 2005, the parade was also broadcast on CBS, and KTTV also televised the parade from the station&#x27;s sign-on in 1949 until 1995. ABC serves as the official broadcaster of the parade, and its sister network ESPN currently airs the Rose Bowl (which formerly aired on ABC).
* The 1947 parade was the first to be televised (on KTLA). However, reportedly experimental station W6XAO (now KCBS-TV) broadcast the 1940 parade.
* The 1954 parade was also the first program televised in the NTSC color television format nationwide on NBC.
* The 1967 parade was broadcast for the first time in Spanish on KMEX-DT to the Los Angeles area. 
* The 1987 parade was broadcast in Spanish on Univision nationwide.
* The 1985 parade was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award Outstanding Special Class Program, with the producers at CBS, as well as co-hosts Bob Barker and Joan Van Ark, attached as the potential recipients if the broadcast had won. 
* The 1989 parade was broadcast in 3D on KTTV.
* The 1999 parade was first broadcast in high definition television (HDTV) on KTLA.

* The website was viewed in 150 countries.
* The 2010 Parade was watched via TV in 127 countries including China.
* The 2011 Parade had a total television reach of approximately 47 million television viewers in the U.S. and was seen by approximately 28 million viewers internationally.
* The 2013 Parade was also streamed on Xbox Live via both their WatchESPN (U.S.) and Live Event Player (all other countries) applications.
* In 2018 and 2019, Funny or Die partnered with Amazon Video to produce a comedic broadcast of the parade, starring Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon as the characters of Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan—who were claimed to have been local newscasters for 25 years. The 2018 broadcast was nominated at the WGA Awards for Best Comedy/Variety Special.
* Since there was no parade in 2021, a TV special “Rose Parade’s New Year Celebration presented by Honda” was aired, including highlights from past parades.
* The official Rose Parade YouTube channel debuted its own livestream of the parade for 2024, countering with KTLA&#x27;s simulcast.
* 10.5 million viewers watched the Rose Parade on NBC and ABC in 2024, with the two networks roughly equally dividing the audience. Combined, the audience ranked in fifth place among television specials in 2024.

==Volunteers==

===Leadership===

Each year, the newly elected Tournament of Roses President is responsible for selecting the year&#x27;s theme and grand marshal. Preparation and construction of the floral floats theoretically begins after the theme is announced. The selection of marching bands is already well under way except for Rose Bowl Game college bands. In 2005, Libby Evans Wright was elected as the first female president of the Association.

The Pasadena Tournament of Roses appointed former &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; executive P. Scott McKibben as its executive director in 2010, replacing John M. (Mitch) Dorger, who had served as CEO since 2000. On September 8, 2011, he resigned for personal reasons. Chief Operating Officer William B. Flinn was named interim executive director. From March 1, 2012, to January 2, 2017, William B. Flinn took over the role of Executive Director. David Eads became the Executive Director in 2017.

===Operations and the parade===

The Tournament of Roses has become such a large event that it requires 65,000 hours of combined manpower each year, or the equivalent of roughly 7.42 years of combined manpower. The group has 935 members, each of whom is assigned to one of 34 committees, and around 50 student ambassadors. Responsibilities include:
* Selecting Parade participants
* Inspecting and testing floats for safe and reliable operation
* Assembling the parade elements
* Conducting the parade through the streets of Pasadena
* Directing visitors on New Year&#x27;s Day
* Assisting the public and the media in viewing the parade
* Giving presentations about the Tournament to community groups
* Supervising elements of the Rose Bowl Game (and also the BCS National Championship Game when held in Pasadena)

During the Parade, many Tournament members are required to wear white suits with red ties, name tags, membership pins and official ribbons. Because of this, the volunteers are commonly referred to as &quot;White Suiters.&quot; In December each year, a fleet of white vehicles with special &quot;ToR&quot; license plates are seen throughout the San Gabriel Valley. The use of these cars is currently donated by American Honda for use by high-ranking Tournament members.
Each year, an honor troop of Eagle Scouts from the San Gabriel Valley Council, (now GLAAC), and &quot;The Tournament Troop&quot; of Girl Scout Gold Award recipients of the Arcadia Service Unit of the Girl Scouts Greater Los Angeles, is selected to carry the parade banners down the route. Each year, for the last 35 years, more than 100 scouts have participated.

The &quot;Tournament of Roses Radio Amateurs&quot; (TORRA) provided audio communications and video co-ordination for the parade officials through the use of Amateur radio from 1968 until 2005. With over 300 ham radio operators in TORRA there were several ham radio sites along the parade route equipped with amateur television as well as 2-way ham radios. Several mobile units – including motorcycles and pedestrian units (creepie-peepies) provided the video coverage. With modern technology and cell phone service, TORRA was no longer needed.

Thousands more volunteers help cover the floats in those beautiful flower and seed mixes during &quot;Deco week,&quot; Dec 26- parade day. Many of these come back year after year, some even camp nearby to help all week long.

==Weather==
For the 2006 Tournament of Roses Parade on January 2 (it is always held on January 2 when January 1 falls on a Sunday) winds with gusts up to and five inches (130 mm) of rain in the Pasadena area were predicted. The forecast proved accurate, ruining the 51 year record of good weather for the parade. It rained continuously and heavily throughout the entire 2006 parade. The President of the Tournament, the Grand Marshal of the Parade and the executive committee, deliberated into the early morning at the Tournament House. With street rumors circulating of the parade being canceled or postponed and restlessness of the crowd further east along the parade route, the parade got underway despite the bleak weather. Low television ratings and poor attendance plagued the ceremony. Some floats sustained water damage by the end of the parade.

==The &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; Rule==
The 1893 parade was the first parade to fall on a Sunday. The parade organizers decided that the parade might spook the horses outside of the churches along the parade route and disrupt the services. The &quot;Never on Sunday&quot; rule was instituted and has been in place ever since: if January 1 falls on a Sunday, the parade is shifted to the 2nd.

There are conflicting reports on the number of times this has happened. Several articles say that 2017 (the latest occurrence) was the 15th time.

However, the correct answer seems to be that the 2023 parade was the 20th time this has happened with the years being 1893, 1899, 1905, 1911, 1922, 1928, 1933, 1939, 1950, 1956, 1961, 1967, 1978, 1984, 1989, 1995, 2006, 2012, 2017, and 2023.

<doc id="329625" wikidata="Q468427" url="?curid=329625" title="Mimesis">
<text>Mimesis (; , &quot;mīmēsis&quot;) is a term used in literary criticism and philosophy that carries a wide range of meanings, including &quot;imitatio&quot;, imitation, nonsensuous similarity, receptivity, representation, mimicry, the act of , the act of resembling, and the presentation of the self.

The original Ancient Greek term &quot;mīmēsis&quot; () derives from &quot;mīmeisthai&quot; (, &#x27;to imitate&#x27;), itself coming from &quot;mimos&quot; (, &#x27;imitator, actor&#x27;). In ancient Greece, &quot;mīmēsis&quot; was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, truth, and the good. Plato contrasted &quot;mimesis&quot;, or imitation, with &quot;diegesis&quot;, or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of &quot;mimesis&quot; eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis—understood in literature as a form of realism—is Erich Auerbach&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which opens with a comparison between the way the world is represented in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the way it appears in the Bible.

In addition to Plato and Auerbach, mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as Aristotle, Philip Sidney, Jean Baudrillard (via his concept of Simulacra and Simulation) Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Adam Smith, Gabriel Tarde, Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Paul Ricœur, Guy Debord ( via his conceptual polemical tract,The Society of the Spectacle ) Luce Irigaray, Jacques Derrida, René Girard, Nikolas Kompridis, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Michael Taussig, Merlin Donald, Homi Bhabha, Roberto Calasso, and Nidesh Lawtoo. During the nineteenth century, the racial politics of imitation towards African Americans influenced the term mimesis and its evolution.

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both Plato and Aristotle saw in mimesis the representation of nature, including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both &quot;Ion&quot; and &quot;The Republic&quot; (Books II, III, and X). In &quot;Ion&quot;, he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing &quot;art&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot; (&quot;techne&quot;) of the subject, the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato&#x27;s account of the Forms). As Plato has it, truth is the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth. He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth.

In Book II of &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato describes Socrates&#x27; dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.

Developing upon this in Book X, Plato told of Socrates&#x27;s metaphor of the three beds: One bed exists as an idea made by God (the Platonic ideal, or form); one is made by the carpenter, in imitation of God&#x27;s idea; and one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter&#x27;s.

So the artist&#x27;s bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter&#x27;s (the craftsman&#x27;s) art, and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, the imitators will nonetheless still not attain the truth (of God&#x27;s creation).

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato&#x27;s writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of four causes in nature. The first, the formal cause, is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as &quot;telos&quot;.

Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. &quot;Poetics&quot; is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling the urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to catharsis. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through &quot;simulated representation,&quot; mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage, which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may empathise with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can be achieved only if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being &quot;an imitation of an action&quot; and of tragedy as &quot;falling from a higher to a lower estate&quot; and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more &quot;tragic&quot; circumstances than before. He posited the characters in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
===Contrast to diegesis===
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted &quot;mimesis&quot; with &quot;diegesis&quot; (Greek: διήγησις). Mimesis &quot;shows&quot;, rather than &quot;tells&quot;, by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the &quot;telling&quot; of the story by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters&#x27; minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the &quot;invisible narrator&quot; or even the &quot;all-knowing narrator&quot; who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book III of his &quot;Republic&quot; (c. 373 BC), Plato examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, tragedy, and epic and lyric poetry): all types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (&quot;diegesis&quot;) and imitation or representation (&quot;mimesis&quot;). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the dithyramb is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in epic poetry. When reporting or narrating, &quot;the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is anyone else;&quot; when imitating, the poet produces an &quot;assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture.&quot; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.

In his &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and lyre music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their &quot;medium&quot;, according to their &quot;objects&quot;, and according to their &quot;mode&quot; or &quot;manner&quot; (section I); &quot;For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us.&quot;

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato&#x27;s and Aristotle&#x27;s formulations.

In ludology, mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay &quot;Crimes Against Mimesis&quot;.

===Dionysian &quot;imitatio&quot;===

Dionysian &quot;imitatio&quot; is the influential literary method of imitation as formulated by Greek author Dionysius of Halicarnassus in the 1st century BC, who conceived it as technique of rhetoric: emulating, adapting, reworking, and enriching a source text by an earlier author.

Dionysius&#x27; concept marked a significant departure from the concept of &quot;mimesis&quot; formulated by Aristotle in the 4th century BC, which was only concerned with &quot;imitation of nature&quot; rather than the &quot;imitation of other authors.&quot; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius&#x27; &quot;imitatio&quot; and discarded Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;mimesis&quot;.

==Modern usage==
===Samuel Taylor Coleridge===
Referring to it as &quot;imitation&quot;, the concept of mimesis was crucial for Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s theory of the imagination. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and Philip Sidney, adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to William Wordsworth&#x27;s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

=== Erich Auerbach ===
One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis—understood in literature as a form of realism—is Erich Auerbach&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1953), which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the way it appears in the Bible. From these two seminal texts Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study.

=== Walter Benjamin ===
In his essay, &quot;On The Mimetic Faculty&quot;(1933) Walter Benjamin outlines connections between mimesis and sympathetic magic, imagining a possible origin of astrology arising from an interpretation of human birth that assumes its correspondence with the apparition of a seasonally rising constellation augurs that new life will take on aspects of the myth connected to the star.

===Luce Irigaray===
Belgian feminist Luce Irigaray used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves to expose and undermine such stereotypes.

===Michael Taussig===

In &quot;Mimesis and Alterity&quot; (1993), anthropologist Michael Taussig examines the way that people from one culture adopt another&#x27;s nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of alterity). He describes how a legendary tribe, the &quot;White Indians&quot; (the Guna people of Panama and Colombia), have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Guna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this reductionism is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his &quot;Mimesis and Alterity&quot; to see values in the anthropologists&#x27; perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.

===René Girard===
In &quot;Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World&quot; (1978), René Girard posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: &quot;It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world,&quot; but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: &quot;rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another.&quot;

=== Roberto Calasso ===
In &quot;The Unnameable Present,&quot; Calasso outlines the way that mimesis, called &quot;Mimickry&quot; by Joseph Goebbels—though it is a universal human ability—was interpreted by the Third Reich as being a sort of original sin attributable to &quot;the Jew.&quot; Thus, an objection to the tendency of human beings to mimic one another instead of &quot;just being themselves&quot; and a complementary, fantasized desire to achieve a return to an eternally static pattern of predation by means of &quot;will&quot; expressed as systematic mass-murder became the metaphysical argument (underlying circumstantial, temporally contingent arguments deployed opportunistically for propaganda purposes) for perpetrating the Holocaust amongst the Nazi elite. Insofar as this issue or this purpose was ever even explicitly discussed in print by Hitler&#x27;s inner-circle, in other words, this was the justification (appearing in the essay &quot;Mimickry&quot; in a war-time book published by Joseph Goebbels). The text suggests that a radical failure to understand the nature of mimesis as an innate human trait or a violent aversion to the same, tends to be a diagnostic symptom of the totalitarian or fascist character if it is not, in fact, the original unspoken occult impulse that animated the production of totalitarian or fascist movements to begin with.

Calasso&#x27;s argument here echoes, condenses and introduces new evidence to reinforce one of the major themes of Adorno and Horkheimer&#x27;s &quot;Dialectic of the Enlightenment&quot; (1944)&quot;,&quot; which was itself in dialog with earlier work hinting in this direction by Walter Benjamin who died during an attempt to escape the gestapo. Calasso insinuates and references this lineage throughout the text. The work can be read as a clarification of their earlier gestures in this direction, written while the Holocaust was still unfolding.

Calasso&#x27;s earlier book &quot;The Celestial Hunter,&quot; written immediately prior to &quot;The Unnamable Present,&quot; is an informed and scholarly speculative cosmology depicting the possible origins and early prehistoric cultural evolution of the human mimetic faculty. In particular, the books first and fifth chapters (&quot;In The Time of the Great Raven&quot; and &quot;Sages &amp; Predators&quot;) focuses on the terrain of mimesis and its early origins, though insights in this territory appear as a motif in every chapter of the book.

=== Nidesh Lawtoo ===
In &quot;Homo Mimeticus&quot; (2022) Swiss philosopher and critic Nidesh Lawtoo develops a relational theory of mimetic subjectivity arguing that not only desires but all affects are mimetic, for good and ill. Lawtoo opens up the transdisciplinary field of &quot;mimetic studies&quot; to account for the proliferation of hypermimetic affects in the digital age.

<doc id="329631" wikidata="Q273880" url="?curid=329631" title="Beppu">
<text>is a city in Ōita Prefecture on the island of Kyushu, Japan. As of November 30, 2023, the city had a population of 113,045 in 62,702 households, and a population density of 900 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . Beppu is famous for its hot springs. In 2024, Beppu celebrated its centenary as a city.

==Geography==
Beppu is situated at the west end of Beppu Bay, around the east central prefecture. Adjacent municipalities include Ōita (the prefectural capital), Usa, Yufu, and Hiji.

The east area of the city consists of an alluvial fan as well as alluvial plain, made with rivers flowing into Beppu Bay, namely Asami River, Haruki River and Sakai River. The main urban area of Beppu has been formed within this relatively narrow land which spans approximately 5 km from east to west and 10 km from north to south.

The west area of the city includes a number of scenic locations such as Yufugawa Canyon, which has been selected as one of One Hundred Views of Oita, and/or some designated areas of Aso Kujū National Park, with a large amount of forests.

Around the city are mountains or highlands with elevations of several hundreds meters above sea level. Most of those mountains are Quaternary volcanoes. Particularly, locations such as Mount Tsurumi is relatively new, and fumarolic activities are observed. Besides Mount Tsurumi, Mount Yufu, Mount Ohira and others comprise a range of mountains.

There are a large number of seismic faults on the north and south of the alluvial fan, surrounding the urban area (giving rise to a large number of thermal vents). Given the short distance from the sea shore on the east coast to the west part of the city with altitude of several hundreds meters or higher, the city has many slopes mainly on the east-west direction.

===Climate===
Beppu has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Beppu is 15.2 °C.

Beppu Port (later Kunisaki Port) was opened on May 30, 1871, with connections to Osaka and other ports on the Seto Inland Sea. It was the main logistics hub for the Imperial Japanese Army during the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. Hot spring development as a tourist destination began in earnest from 1879 with the opening of Takegawara Onsen. In 1885, a ferry service to Uwajima in Shikoku commenced. The village of Beppu was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system and was raised to town status on April 11, 1893.

<text>is a city located in Ōita Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 61,148 in 27556 households, and a population density of 96 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . 

==Geography==
Hita is located in the far west of Ōita Prefecture, and borders the neighboring prefectures of Fukuoka and Kumamoto. Surrounding cities include Kurume to the west, Nakatsu to the north, and Kusu to the east. Hita is a natural basin surrounded by mountains, with several rivers that eventually become the Chikugo River. Due to this connection, although Hita is placed within Ōita Prefecture, it shares a historical connection to Fukuoka Prefecture. The dialect used in Hita has characteristics of the Hichiku dialect used in Fukuoka, Nagasaki, and Saga Prefectures.

Many rivers that run through Hita join up to the Mikuma River, and later the Chikugo River. These rivers were used to distribute lumber to Kurume and Ōkawa at the end of the Edo Period, but with the completion of the Yoake Dam, the use of this route stopped.

The mountains surrounding the Hita basin reach 1000 meters (3,281 ft) above sea level, while some mountains around Nakatsue, Maetsue, and Kamitsue reach 1200 meters (3,937 ft) above sea level.

===Climate===
Hita has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). As a basin, the change in temperature from day to night during summer and winter is steep. Hita has a high annual precipitation rate, with over one third of the rain falling during the rainy season months of June and July. Heavy rainfall is frequent, and severe flood damage has occurred in the past. From spring to autumn, a deep fog known locally as &quot;sokogiri&quot; (底霧, shallow ground fog) often appears in the morning.

Summer gets very hot, with temperatures often rising above , while winter gets notably cold. At times the temperature falls to . Hita gets more snow than average for Ōita Prefecture. While snow inside the main city area accumulates to less than a year, the mountain regions can accumulate more than of snow.

In the Maetsue mountain area the precipitation rate is high. While this helps grow the Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress trees used in the forestry industry, it also causes landslides.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hita in 2020 is 62,657 people. Hita has been conducting censuses since 1920.

==History==

The area of Hita was part of ancient Bungo Province. It is mentioned in the &quot;Bungo no Kuni Fudoki&quot;, which was compiled between 720 and 740, which states that Emperor Keiko visited this area during his expedition to Kyushu. Numerous Kofun period ruins indicate the presence of a powerful local kingdom in late prehistoric times. During the Edo period it was divided between Mori Domain and &quot;tenryō&quot; territory ruled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji restoration, the towns of Mameda (豆田町 ) and Kuma (隈町) within Hita District, Ōita were established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On November 1, 1901 the two towns merged to form the town of Hita. On December 11, 1940 Hita merged with the villages of Miyoshi, Mitsuoka, Takase, Asahi, Mihana, and Nishiarita merge to form the city of Hita. On March 31, 1955 the villages of Higashiarita, Ono, Otsuru, Yoake, and Gowa were annexed by the city of Hita.

On March 22, 2005, the towns of Amagase and Ōyama, and the villages of Kamitsue, Maetsue and Nakatsue (all from Hita District) were merged into Hita. With this merger, the borders of the city of Hita were now the same as the original district of Hita, and the district was abolished. 

==Government==
Hita has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Hita contributes three members to the Ōita Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Ōita 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Forestry has long flourished in Hita due to the abundant tree supply in the surrounding mountains. Japanese cedar trees called &quot;Hita Cedar&quot; are used to make &quot;geta&quot; and lacquerware. In recent years the forest industry has declined as a result of the importation of cheap foreign lumber.

From the 1960s, after large areas of cultivated land became difficult to obtain, agriculture in Hita has been shifting its focus from rice to crops grown in the mountains, such as ume, Japanese chestnuts, and mushrooms.

A fishing industry is present, with ayu and other fish captured in the Mikuma River.

Hita is well-known for its high quality water. Hita Tenryosui produces mineral water, and many distilleries produce sake and shōchū.

Recently, companies such as TDK, Kyushu Sumidenso, Sapporo Breweries, and Sanwa Shurui have expanded manufacturing in the area.

=== Tourism ===
During the Edo period, Hita was modeled after Kyoto and its merchant culture, and even now is nicknamed &quot;Little Kyoto&quot;. Traces of old Kyoto are apparent in the streets of Mameda-machi (豆田町), a town where buildings of the time period have been preserved. Prominent buildings include the Hirose Museum (廣瀬資料館), the Kusano House (草野本家), the Nihongan Medicine Museum (日本丸館), and the Tenryō Hita Museum (天領日田資料館). There is also the Kuncho Shuzō Sake Brewery (薫長酒蔵資料館), which has a museum and shop.

Kangien (咸宜園跡) was a private school built by Hirose Tansō in 1805. The school&#x27;s name means &quot;everyone is welcome,&quot; and students from all over Japan came to study in Hita, regardless of age, gender, or social status. Kangien has been designated as a Japan Heritage site and two buildings remain standing: Shūfūan (秋風庵) and Enshirō (遠思楼). An education research center has also been built at the site.

Taio gold mine is located in Nakatsue village; the mine was in operation from 1898 to 1972, but now remains as a museum.

From July to November, fishermen erect bamboo fish traps in the Mikuma River to capture ayu fish, which are covered in salt and grilled.

Hita has many onsen hot springs, particularly along the Mikuma River and in Amagase.

<text>MTV3 (, ) is a Finnish commercial television channel owned and operated by the media company MTV Oy, originally launched in 13 August 1957 as a programming block, becoming its own channel on 1 January 1993. It had the biggest audience share of all Finnish TV channels until Yle TV1 (from Yle) took the lead. MTV actually stands for Mainos-TV (literally &quot;Advertisement-TV&quot;, i.e. &quot;Commercial TV), due to the channel carrying advertising for revenue. Number 3 was added later, when the channel was allocated the third nationwide television channel and it generally became known as &quot;Channel Three&quot;—Finnish Broadcasting Company&#x27;s Yle TV1 and Yle TV2 being the first two—and also to distinguish it from the later MTV Finland, which is a Finnish version of Paramount&#x27;s MTV channel. From 1957 until 2001, the channel&#x27;s logo was a stylised owl, changed to an owl&#x27;s eye after an image renewal in 2001, which was then used until 2013. MTV3 has about 500 employees. It is also known as Maikkari ( slang for &quot;Mainos-TV&quot;). From 1986 to 1993, Kolmoskanava was a precursor to MTV3. It was shut down at midnight on December 31, and MTV3 immediately started broadcasting.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Oy Mainos-TV-Reklam Ab, or MTV for short, was founded on 29 April 1957 with the idea of establishing a commercial television channel that would show advertisements between programmes. MTV was one of the earliest nationwide private television networks in Europe, preceded only by the ITV network in the United Kingdom and RTL in Luxembourg.

The project set out to lease programming blocks from Yleisradio (YLE), the public broadcaster, whose television project &quot;Suomen Televisio&quot; had already begun test broadcasts. Yleisradio was initially reluctant but eventually agreed to get additional revenue, which was required to produce programmes to compete with TES-TV. According to the initial agreement, MTV only got around ten hours a week of airtime, all outside the prime time and was not allowed to produce its newscasts nor air party political broadcasts. MTV&#x27;s first broadcast was on 13 August 1957.

During the early years, MTV was on shaky financial and political grounds. The company survived the troubles and by the early 1960s had begun to establish its position. As Yleisradio expanded the range of television broadcasts, MTV&#x27;s coverage also increased. This gave them a significant competitive edge over TES-TV since renamed to Tesvisio, whose broadcasts could only be watched in some of the larger cities. In 1964, Yleisradio announced that they had purchased Tesvisio (who were nearing bankruptcy) outright and that they would launch a second channel reorganized from Tesvisio&#x27;s assets. MTV expressed demands that the second channel be given to them, but Yleisradio refused any such attempts, agreeing however to give MTV more air time, even some prime time, on the second channel. TV-ohjelma 2 (&quot;TV programme 2&quot;) launched on 7 March 1965, with Suomen Televisio renamed to TV-ohjelma 1 (&quot;TV programme 1&quot;). 

Even though YLE and MTV broadcast on the same two channels, they were effectively considered separate networks and organised daily handovers, including airing idents, to the other network whenever MTV&#x27;s programming blocks began or ended. This could happen independently for either of the two channels, since they had independent schedules as time went on, a distinction in terms of programming between the two broadcasters developed, with MTV focusing on lighter entertainment and YLE on informative programmes. MTV moved their headquarters to a new building, &quot;Pöllölaakso&quot; , in Ilmala in 1967. The first colour broadcast on MTV was aired in 1970. Like with Yleisradio, colour programming increased gradually and by the end of the 1970s, most programmes were in colour. To commemorate the colour transition, MTV introduced a new, simplified owl logo in 1975 which would remain in use until 1993.

=== MTV becomes MTV3 ===
After much political wrangling and prolonged discussions with Yleisradio, in 1981, MTV managed to introduce their news programme, Kymmenen uutiset (&quot;the ten o&#x27;clock news&quot;). The company was renamed to MTV Oy in 1982.

In the mid-1980s, Yleisradio, MTV, and Nokia began a joint venture to establish a pay television channel. This project culminated in 1986 in the launch of a third nationwide channel, Kolmoskanava, which was however free-to-air. The channel mostly broadcast imports but some original shows were broadcast as well (albeit not produced by the channel). MTV also began broadcasting their programmes on the channel and started to increase their share in the project. By 1990, MTV had a majority share in the channel.

MTV3, a replacement for Kolmoskanava was launched at midnight on 1 January 1993 in a grand launch event. MTV moved all of its programming to MTV3 and stopped leasing blocks from channels one and two, leaving them entirely to YLE and to become the modern channels Yle TV1 and Yle TV2.

=== After 1993 ===

MTV Oy was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union in 1993, the same year MTV3 was launched. This membership ended in 2019.

In 2005 Alma Media sold MTV3 and its sister channels (MTV3+, Subtv, Radio Nova and a share in Urheilukanava) to Swedish company Bonnier, which in turn sold the channel to telecommunications company Telia on 20 July 2018.

In late-2022 and early-2023, MTV3 moved its headquarters and studios to its present location at the Fredriksberg D office building in Vallila. The former building at Ilmala was subsequently demolished to make way for apartments.

==Programming==
MTV3 broadcasts every day from morning to small hours. The pre-dawn hours are allocated to a reel showing clips from programs that are on MTV Katsomo, a streaming service.

Much of the output of MTV3 is a mixture of Finnish versions of popular program formats and of American and British imports. However, MTV3 also airs its own domestic original programming. For example, many of Spede Pasanen&#x27;s productions were produced for MTV3.

MTV3 maintains two main news broadcasts every day on prime time, the Seitsemän uutiset at 19:00 EET and Kymmenen uutiset at 22:00 EET. MTV3 also broadcast news every morning and short bulletins at 21:00 EET.

MTV3 brought the first daily soap opera to Finland, by showing the American &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, which in 1990s became the most popular show on the channel. In 1999, MTV3 started showing Finnish daily soap opera &quot;Salatut elämät&quot;.

== Biography ==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Thatcher&#x27;s family moved to Butler County, Kentucky in 1874 and settled near Morgantown. Thatcher worked in farming, on a newspaper and in county offices. He was elected the circuit court clerk for Butler County in 1892 and served from January 1, 1893, until his resignation in 1896. He studied law in Frankfort, Kentucky and was admitted to the bar in 1898, commencing his law practice in Frankfort. Thatcher was an Assistant Attorney General of Kentucky 1898–1900 and then moved to Louisville, Kentucky in 1900. He was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky from 1901 to 1906 and a state inspector and examiner for Kentucky 1908–1910.

Thatcher was also a member of the Isthmian Canal Commission and governor of the Canal Zone from 1909 to 1913. Thatcher was the Commission&#x27;s longest-lived and last surviving member.

During his congressional tenure, he guided the passage of several Kentucky landmarks and parks: Mammoth Cave National Park, Lincoln&#x27;s birthplace, and the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery. In 1932, he gave up his seat in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat Alben W. Barkley for election to the United States Senate.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Nichinan in 2020 is 50,848 people. Nichinan has been conducting censuses since 1920.
==History==
The area of Nichinan was part of ancient Hyūga Province. During the Sengoku period, the area was ruled by the Itō clan based at Obi Castle and the site of numerous battles with the neighbouring Shimazu clan. The Shimazu clan had unified Satsuma Province and Ōsumi Province under its control, and began to clash with the Itō in 1570. The Itō were finally defeated by the Shimazu clan in 1578. After seeking help from the hegemon Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the family&#x27;s lands were restored in 1587 after his invasion of Kyūshū. By the Edo Era, the Itō clan ruled as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Obi Domain, and the present-day city borders roughly correspond to the holdings of the domain. The domain was noted for the quality of its han school, one of whose graduates was the Meiji period diplomat Marquis Komura Jutarō. 

The town of Aburatsu and the villages of Agata, Obi, Hosoda, Nangō and Tōgō were established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Obi was raised to town status on January 1, 1900, followed by Nangō on December 1, 1940, Hosoda on January 1, 1941 and Agata on May 3, 1950. On January 1, 1950, the city of Nichinan was established through an amalgamation of the towns of Agata, Aburatsu, and Obi, and the village of Tōgō. On February 1, 1955, Futo village and Hosoda town joined the city. On April 1, 1956, Nichinan absorbed Sakatani village, Kahara village, and the Odotsu district. 

Since 1963, Nichinan has been the spring training location for the Hiroshima Carp baseball team.

In 1999, a 12-meter wharf was completed at the eastern head of Aburatsu port. Aburatsu&#x27;s increasing role as a harbor has made it a regular stopover for both domestic and foreign ships, and it is becoming an authentic international trading port. From 2001 to 2010, a general plan for the future of Nichinan was drawn up, with the simple theme of progressing Nichinan as, &quot;a city that combines its fragrant history and culture with the sunshine and lush green mountains.&quot;

During the nationwide round of Heisei-era mergers, the was formed in August 2004 by the area&#x27;s residents to consider the merger of the three municipalities. The group was dissolved in May 2005 when the Kitagō Town Council vetoed the proposed merger bill despite support for the merger by residents in both Kitagō and Nangō towns. The association was reconstituted on September 28, 2007, when merger supporters in both towns gained majorities on their respective town councils. On March 30, 2009, the three municipalities agreed to merge and become the new city of Nichinan.

On August 8, 2024 at 16:22 JST, the 7.1 2024 Hyūga-nada earthquake struck in the Hyūga Sea off the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan, northeast of Nichinan. Nichinan experienced seismic intensity of 6- on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale.

The area of Kobayashi was part of ancient Hyūga Province and was called &quot;Hinamori&quot; (夷守) in the Nara period as it was the location of a military settlement on the frontier of the Yamato Kingdom against the Hayato people further south. Miyama Castle was completed around the time of the Genpei War at the end of the Heian period, and the area came to be called &quot;Miyama&quot;. In the Sengoku period, after considerable turmoil, the area came under the control of the Itō clan. The Itō were defeated by the Shimazu clan of Satsuma Province in 1572, who established a stronghold at Kobayashi Castle. The &quot;jōkamachi&quot; which developed around this castle became the core of modern Kobayashi. The Shimazu continued to rule the area as part of Satsuma Domain to the end of the Edo Period. In 1871, with the abolition of the han system, the area was incorporated into Kagoshima Prefecture, but was later transferred to Miyazaki Prefecture. The village of Kobayashi was established on May 1, 1889, with the creation of the modern municipalities system.

Mythology

The inhabitants, who lived in the mountains of Kuma-gun in Higo, Kurino, Yokokawa, Hyokiyama, and Soo-gun in Osumi, defeated the court and did not donate their annual tribute to the court. Emperor Keiko visited the Kyushu region to subdue them. He departed from Kyoto, passed through Nagato and Toyokuni, then at Hyuga, he established Takaya-no-miya (near Saito) to fight the Kumaso. On his way back to Kyoto, he stopped by Hinamori, nearby Kobayashi city. At that time, the hills surrounding the Mt. Idenoyama were said to have housed the royal family, and there was a beautiful lady called Izumihime. Izumihime poured tea made with the spring water from Idenoyama to the Emperor. The cup of tea made him comforted and healed the tiredness of the battle. The emperor and Izumihime grew warm affection one day. The time of return came and the Emperor departed for Kyoto. It is said that she mourned herself in the pond and turned into a snake as a guardian angel. Even now, the Benzaiten Festival is held every April to celebrate Mizugami-sama, and there is still a stone that is connected to the grave of Izumihime next to the cemetery in Oidemizu district. Excerpt of the legendary &quot;Izumihime Monogatari&quot;
;Inyoseki Rock

Inyoseki is a couple rock in the Homanose river which is located in east part of Kobayashi city. You can find them in the downstream of Sannomiyakyo Gorge. The volcanic activity that was activated about 1.8 million years ago, deposited a large amount of volcanic ash and lava, which was formed by erosion by rivers. There is a 17.5-meter-high phallic-shaped yang stone (male stone), and beside it is a 5.5-meter-periphery-shaped gylinite (female stone). Since ancient times, it has been worshiped as the god of marriage, child treasure and prayer for safe delivery. However, it became widely known as a sightseeing spot after a new road was constructed in 1917 (until then, there was no other way to the ridge). In 1950, Kobayashi Municipal &quot;Hamanoseso Ryokan&quot; was opened, and since then, the &quot;Inyoseki Festival&quot; is held every September. In April 1929, Noguchi Ujo, a poet, visited this Inyoseki and composed a poem, which is on a monument erected in 1951.
;Kirishima Mountain
Kirishimayama Mountain is a collective term for volcanic groups near the border between Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures in southern Kyushu. Also called Kirishima Volcanoes, they form a mountain mass between and around the highest peak of Karakuni-dake (1,700m above sea level) and the sacred peak of Takachiho-no-Mine (1,574m above sea level). It is an active volcano that repeats eruptions since its history was recorded (volcanic activation is ranked B by the Japan Meteorological Agency), and active volcanic activity has continued particularly at Shinmoe-dake and Ohachi. Those mountains have been selected as volcanoes that need to be monitored and an observation system for volcanic disaster prevention by the Volcanic Eruption Prediction Council has been established.

History

According to the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, this mountain was the place of Tenson-korin; a couple of gods, Izanagi (male) and Izanami (female) descended from Takama-no-Hara, heaven, to Takachiho-no-Mine. There is a halberd placed upside down on the peak of Takachiho-no-Mine, this is called Ama-no-Sakahoko, or the halberd of the heaven. It is said, that Izanagi-no-Mikoto and Izanami-no-Mikoto placed the Ama-no-Sakahoko on the peak of Takachiho-no-Mine, and mixed the earth to create the country. The origin of &quot;Kirishima&quot; is based on the theory that, if you look into this area from afar, Kirishima Mountain range looks like an island floating in the sea of fog. Or, it is said that when the Tenson-Korin, the fog was very thick and they could hardly see surroundings. As soon as they sowed the rice ears brought from Takama-no-Hara, the fog soon cleared. Or, there is also a theory that the volcanic plume was regarded as fog.

Folklore

People say that a hermit lives in the Kirishima. Below are The Seven Wonders of Kirishima:

# Makazu-no-Tane, or seeds without sowing rice may grow on the mountains. This is attributed to the species brought from Takama-no-Hara, or heaven, when the Tenson-Korin; two gods descendant to Kirishima mountain in ancient times.
# Moji Iwa, or character rock on the west side of Kirishima Shrine, there is a large rock of 10 cubic meters. You will find some Sanskrit characters are engraved on the inside despite the small gaps that are difficult to reach. 
# Kame Ishi, or turtle rock on the old approach to Kirishima Shrine, there is a rock that looks exactly like a turtle. It is said, that a turtle that has broken his promise to God and was then turned into a rock. 
# Kazaana, or wind hole. There is a rock with a hole where the wind blows out on the old approach to Kirishima Shrine. 
# Mitarashigawa, or Mitarashi river. A river that dries out in winter and a lot of water comes out around May. It is said, that it contains the water of Manai brought from Takama-no-Hara when Tenson-Korin, or when the gods descended.
# Ryodogawa, or Ryodo river. A river that flows only from June to September. The river flows twice at intervals of several days and is called the Ryodo, meaning twice river. 
# Kagura at midnight. When Kirishima Jingu was relocated to its current location, many people are said to have heard Kagura, sounds that should not be heard at midnight. Originally, Kagura involved songs and dances that were dedicated to the deities.
;Ito-zuka
Ito Yoshisuke was a daimyo who ruled most of the Himuka-no-Kuni. On May 3, 1572, he with around 3,000 troops attacked Kakuto Castle, protected by Shimadzu&#x27;s vassal, Kawakami Tadatomo, from Minoyama (Kobayashi), the front base. However, the Ito army retreats to Kizakibaru (Iino, Ebino-city) once after unexpected resistance. When Shimazu Yoshihiro, who had been waiting for the Ito army at Iino Castle, received the report, he immediately sent his troops to Kizakibaru, and on May 4, the troops went into a fierce battle. The battle ended with a major victory for Shimadzu, and the defeated Ito quickly declined, and Shimadzu began to rule over Himuka-no-Kuni. This is The Battle of Kizakibaru, which was later called &quot;The Battle of Okehazama&quot; in Kyushu.

[The Battle of Okehazama took place in Nagoya, Aichi in 1560. It is a historic upheaval battle in which only 3,000 Oda Nobunaga troops defeated 45,000 Imagawa Yoshimoto troops. By this battle, Oda made his name known throughout the country.]
Of the more than 500 Ito troops who died in the battle of Kizakibaru, more than 200 main ones, such as General Ito Kagamori/Sukeyasu, were buried in Magata-Inba-Zuka, and this tomb was later called Ito-zuka. They are just memorial towers, there are no bodies under them.
The descendants of Shimazu warlord Godai Tomoyasu/Shozaemon built a five-story pagoda to comfort the spirits of Ito troops, and in 1817, the lord of Kobayashi built a monument and engraved the sentence &quot;Look at the old days of today&quot;. The mound is a historic site designated by Miyazaki prefecture. Location; 160-2 Magata, Kobayashi, Miyazaki (located on a hill behind Kobayashi High School)
;Kobayashi Castle

Kobayashi Castle was a castle on a hill in the plains. It is also known as Mitsuyama Castle or Minoyama Castle. Currently, Shiroyama Park.

In 1566, Ito Yoshisuke commanded Mera Shigekata, the lord of Suki castle, to build a castle to defend against the Shimazu, the daimyo of Satsuma and as a front-line base for the Iino Castle attack. The Iwase river (now Ishigori river) surrounds the west, north and east of this Kobayashi castle, forming like a natural moat, and the southern part faces cliffs of shirasu soil, which is volcanic ash soil making it difficult to climb. The Kobayashi castle was protected by the natural hazards that cannot be easily reached to the castle. At first it was called Mitsuyama Castle or Minoyama Castle, however there was another castle called the same for Kitahara, so Ito&#x27;s castle was renamed Kobayashi Castle since it was in Kobayashi Village. At present, it is a privately owned land. There are markers, such as the indicator of the Honmaru, the main bailey, but most of part is covered with grove of mixed trees.

;Suki Castle
Suki Castle was one of the Forty-eight Castles of Ito on a hill in the plains. It is also known as Tsurumaru Castle. Currently, Shiroyama Park nearby Sukimuland.

Suki Castle is a collective term. It has Hidaki castle at the foot, Araki castle on the middle, then Matsuo / Tsurumaru castle at the summit as a Honmaru, the main bailey. Matsuo Castle is surrounded by cliffs and only a part of the southwest is a steep slope. At present there are markers that mark the spots of the castle.

;Nojiri Castle

Nojiri Castle is one of the Forty-eight Castles of Ito on a hill in the plains. It is located in Kobayashi city, former Nojiri Town.

The Castle is surrounded by the Jonoshita river and a cliff, which forms a natural barrier. Initially, it was thought that the castle had Honmaru, the main bailey, in the west and Ninomaru, the second bailey, in the east, but later investigation revealed those were opposite. The Nojiri Honjo, Honmaru, was at the east and the Nojiri Shinjo, Ninomaru, which was later built in the west. So, this castle was actually a paired castle.
Currently it is a farmland, but only the remains on the Nojiri Shinjo side. This well is a Cultural Property designated by Nojiri Town.
;Kayumochida the Old Battlefield Ruins

In 1572, the troops of Ito were chased by their enemy Shimadzu at the Kizakibaru-no-Tatakai, or the battle of Kizakibaru. The best spearman, Yunokizaki Tango-no-Kami (Masaie) boldly turned back, and had a one on one fight against Shimazu Hyogo-no-Kami (Yoshihiro). At the moment when Masaie made a deadly blow to Yoshihiro, the spear missed the target because Yoshihiro&#x27;s horse broke its front knee. During that time Masaie was surrounded and killed by Shimadzu.

They say that the place where this one on one battle took place is today&#x27;s Kayumochida area. The tomb of Yunokizaki Tango-no-Kami remains in the northwest, and a stone monument was built in honor of the martial arts, and is still carefully protected. Kayumochida the Old Battlefield Ruins is where is designated by Kobayashi city.
;The Tomb of Ijuin Tadasane

Ijuin Tadasane was a warlord, serving Shimadzu like his father, Ijuin Tadamune.
In 1597, Toyotomi Hideyoshi commanded the invasion to Korea. Father and son, Ijuin Tadasane, went to war as the Shimadzu troops. In 1598 in the Shisen-no-Tatakai, the Battle at Shisen, it is said that 7,000 of Shimadzu troops defeated 37,000 Korean troops. Since then the name of Shimadzu was feared through Korea, even China.

However, in 1599, Ijuin Tadamune, the father was killed by Shimadzu Tadatsune because the father was too proud of his power. The son, Ijuin Tadasane was standing in his castle, Tsuno Castle, and decided to break ranks with Shimadzu. This is called Shonai-no-Ran, the Shonai Rebellion. He surrendered the next year, but in 1602, he was killed by Shimadzu Tadatsune on the way to Kyoto. According to Professor Yamamoto from Historiographical Institute at the University of Tokyo, for Shimadzu, there was no choice to kill his vassals, Ijuin Tadasane, who was a key person of opposition.
Here in his tomb, there is a memorial tower, which was built for Ijuin Tadasane.
;Tomb of Mera Chikugo-no-Kami
Mera Shigekata was a warlord, serving Ito, the Daimyo of Himuka-no-Kuni, and Shigekata also was the lord of Suki Castle.

In 1566, Shimadzu troops attacked Kobayashi castle, which was under construction, Shigekata fought with his younger brother, Noriyuki. Shigekata injured one of the key warlords, Yoshihiro, and made the Shimadzu troops retreat. In 1568, Shigekata who was as the representative of Ito and Hongo who was from Shimadzu sat down in post-war negotiations in Obi. Shigekata achieved pledging two things, Shimadzu troops retreating and ceding of Obi territory. Since then Shigekata was known as a man with great intelligence and bravery. In 1572, at the Kizakibaru-no-Tatakai, or the Battle of Kizakibaru, Shigekata fought with Ito where he died. Shegekata&#x27;s head was sent to Ichirinji Temple, which was his family temple. There is a five-story pagoda which is engraved the word, which says &quot;Ryushitsukuko&quot;. They say that this pagoda is the one for Mera Shigekata, who was also known as Chikugo-no-Kami.

In 1572, he joined the Kizakibaru-no-Tatakai, or the Battle of Kizakibaru. However, his general Ito was routed because of the trap called &quot;Tsuri-no-Buse&quot; by their enemy, Shimadzu. Tsuri-no-Buse were tactics in a field battle. The entire army is divided into three squads, two of which are hide or lay down and wait ( meaning buse) to the two different sides in advance, then the left squad attacks ( meaning tsuri) pretending to be defeated. The best spearman, Masaie boldly turned back, and was one on one fight against Shimazu Hyogo-no-Kami (Yoshihiro).

<text>is a city in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 57,746, and a population density of 170 persons per km²., making it the 4th largest city in Miyazaki Prefecture in terms of population. The total area of the city is .Hyūga is a port city known for the production of Go stones and for beaches, many of which are popular surfing spots.

== Origin of name ==
Hyuga City took its name from , the historical name of what is now Miyazaki Prefecture. According to Japanese legend in the Nihon Shoki, following the conquest of the Kumaso people, Emperor Keikō watched the sunrise over the ocean and said . From that time, the province was known as Hyuga or Hinata (the country facing the sun) until the Meiji Restoration when it was renamed Miyazaki.

==Geography==
Hyūga is located in central Miyazaki Prefecture. It is bordered by the Hyūga Sea to the east and the Kyushu Mountains to the west. The area along Cape Hyūga with its exposed hexagonal pillar rocks and ria (saw tooth) coastline are designated as part of the Nippō Kaigan Quasi-National Park. A bit south are beaches such as Ise-ga-hama, Okura-ga-hama, and Kane-ga-hama, known for their surfing.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Miyazaki Prefecture
*Kadogawa to the north
*Kijō to the southwest
*Misato to the west
*Tsuno to the south

===Climate===
Hyūga is located in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;), exhibiting four distinct seasons. It has a mild, but humid subtropical climate with no dry season. The climate is comparable to the southern coastal areas of the United States or southern Europe. The average summer daytime temperature is about 30 °C (86 °F) with 80% humidity. The average winter daytime temperature is about 13 °C (56 °F) with 60% humidity. Early summer is marked with the rainy season in June and July. This is followed by a hot, humid summer and daily sunshine, but is often accompanied by typhoons. Winter is mild with small amounts of rain.

===Demographics===
, Hyūga had a total population of 63,011 people; 30,150 males and 32,861 females.

===Districts===
 is Hyūga&#x27;s downtown area. Hyūga City has been engaged in large scale urban renewal, slowly widening roads, creating new businesses, beautifying, and modernizing the city center. As such, Shinmachi is relatively new and modern. This region is centered on Hyūgashi Station.
* 
The southern part of Hososhima is centered on Hyūga&#x27;s commercial fishing port between Komenoyama and Makishimayama. This is an older less frequented part of Hyūga. The streets are narrow and there are numerous old Edo-period buildings.
The northern part of Hososhima is far more industrial. This region has several manufacturing plants and large areas for storage of goods and raw materials. Hososhima Industrial Port currently serves as the main international port in northern Miyazaki Prefecture handling materials and goods import and export in the region. Hososhima Industrial Port is designated as a Special Major Port and was selected as a focus port by the Japanese government in 2010. There continues to be major development and expansion of the port and its available services. Hososhima Port was selected by the Japanese government as Port of the Year 2015.
Mimitsu was a port town to the south of Hyūga which merged in 1955. It is famous for &quot;washi&quot; paper and fishing. It is also supposedly the port from which the first Japanese Emperor, Jimmu, launched his military expedition to conquer Yamato and establish it as the center of power.

In the 19th century, it was a prosperous commercial port that was a hub for trade with the cities of Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, with so many houses belonging to merchants and shipping agents crowded together that people used to refer to the thousand houses of Mimitsu (Mimitsu-sengen). It fell into sharp decline with the advent of railroads. In 1986, it was designated as a national important preservation district for groups of historic buildings, and much of the 19th-century atmosphere, including traditional buildings, earthen walls, and stone pavements, remains.
Tōgō was a small mountain town which merged with Hyūga on February 25, 2006. Togo was the home town of the Japanese writer Bokusui Wakayama.

==History==
Archaeologists working in Hyūga have reported finding artifacts such as stone tools and stone piles from as much as 30,000 years ago, the Japanese Paleolithic period. There is also evidence of inhabitation during the Jōmon period. Archaeological digs uncovering pottery from this time period continue today in parts of the city.

During the Edo period, Hyūga was divided between the holdings of Nobeoka Domain and &quot;tenryō&quot; territory administered directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Hososhima and villages of Iwawaki ad Tomidaka were established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Tomidaka was raised to town status on October 1, 1921. On October 1, 1937, Hososhima and Tomidaka merged to form Toshima Town. Toshima merged with Iwawaki to form the city of Hyūga on April 1, 1951.

===Municipal consolidation===
Modern Hyūga City is a result of the merger of numerous smaller towns and villages. These mergers began at the start of the Meiji Period when the han system was abolished and the concept of towns and cities arose. This time period, between 1888 and 1889, became known as the Great Meiji Consolidation. Following this, towns continued to merge mainly due to population limitations or financial limitations. The most recent merger in 2006 with Tōgō (from Higashiusuki District) was part of the Great Heisei Consolidation. This was a government initiative to counter population declines and financial problems while promoting decentralization of the national government. This merger increased Hyuga City&#x27;s population, tax money, and autonomy.

==Government==
Hyūga has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 20 members. Hyūga contributes two members to the Miyazaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Miyazaki 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Hyūga is a major industrial center, with many chemical plants belonging to the Asahi Kasei group. Other major industries include smelting, titanium production and food processing.

<doc id="329655" wikidata="Q46747" url="?curid=329655" title="Sendai">
<text>is the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture and the largest city in the Tōhoku region. , the city had a population of 1,098,335 in 539,698 households, making it the twelfth most populated city in Japan.

The modern city was founded in 1600 by the &quot;daimyō&quot; Date Masamune. It is nicknamed the ; there are Japanese zelkova trees lining many of the main thoroughfares such as and .
In the summer, the Sendai Tanabata Festival, the largest Tanabata festival in Japan, is held. In winter, the trees are decorated with thousands of lights for the , lasting through most of December. The city is also home to Tohoku University, one of the former Imperial Universities. On 11 March 2011, coastal areas of the city suffered catastrophic damage from a magnitude 9.0 offshore earthquake, which triggered a destructive tsunami.

== History ==
=== Edo period ===
Although the Sendai area was inhabited as early as 20,000 years ago, the history of Sendai as a city begins from 1600, when the &quot;daimyō&quot; Date Masamune relocated. Masamune was not happy with his previous stronghold, Iwadeyama, which was located in the northern portion of his territories and was difficult to access from Edo (modern-day Tokyo). Sendai was an ideal location, being in the centre of Masamune&#x27;s newly defined territories, upon the major road from Edo. Tokugawa Ieyasu gave Masamune permission to build a new castle in Aobayama after the Battle of Sekigahara. The previous ruler of the Sendai area had used a castle located on Aobayama. At this time Sendai was written as (&quot;a thousand generations&quot;), because a temple with a used to be located in Aobayama. Masamune changed the &quot;kanji&quot; to &quot;, which later became &quot; (literally: &quot;hermit/wizard&quot; plus &quot;platform/plateau&quot; or figuratively, &quot;hermit on a platform/high ground&quot;). The character came from a Chinese poem that praised a palace created by the Emperor Wen of Han China (reigned 180–157 BCE), comparing it to a mythical palace in the Kunlun Mountains. Tradition says that Masamune chose this &quot;kanji&quot; so that the castle would prosper as long as a mountain inhabited by an immortal hermit.

Masamune ordered the construction of Sendai Castle in December 1600 and the construction of the surrounding castle town in 1601. The grid plan roads in modern-day central Sendai are based upon his plans.

=== Modern era ===
The first railway line between Sendai and Tokyo, now the Tōhoku Main Line, opened in 1887, bringing the area within a day&#x27;s travel from Tokyo for the first time in history. Tohoku Imperial University, the region&#x27;s first university, was founded in Sendai in 1907 and became the first Japanese university to admit female students in 1913.

Sendai was incorporated as a city on 1 April 1889, with the post-Meiji restoration creation of the modern municipalities system following the abolition of the han system. At the time of incorporation, the city&#x27;s area was and its population was 86,000. The city grew, however, through seven annexations that occurred between 1928 and 1988. The city became a designated city on 1 April 1989; the city&#x27;s population exceeded one million in 1999.

Sendai was considered to be one of Japan&#x27;s greenest cities, mostly because of its great numbers of trees and plants. Sendai became known as The City of Trees before the Meiji Restoration, after the feudal Sendai Domain encouraged residents to plant trees in their gardens. As a result, many houses, temples, and shrines in central Sendai had , which were used as resources for wood and other everyday materials.

In 1925, the Senseki Line to Sendai Station became the first underground railway segment in Japan, preceding the opening of the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line (Asia&#x27;s first subway line) by two years.

The 2nd Infantry Division was known as the &quot;Sendai Division&quot; as it was based in Sendai, and recruited locally. During the Second World War it was involved in many different campaigns, but one of the most important was the Battle of Guadalcanal. During the bombing of Sendai during World War II by the United States on 10 July 1945, much of the historic center of the city was burned, with 2,755 inhabitants killed and 11,933 houses destroyed in the city.

===Postwar development===
Following World War II, the city was rebuilt, and Sendai became a vital transportation and logistics hub for the Tōhoku region with the construction of major arteries such as the Tōhoku Expressway and Tōhoku Shinkansen.

In the early 1950s, the United States Army, Japan operated Camp Schimmelpfennig and Camp Sendai in the city.

Sendai has been subject to several major earthquakes in recent history, including the 1978 Miyagi earthquake, which was a catalyst for the development of Japan&#x27;s current earthquake resistance standards, and the 2005 Miyagi earthquake. Most recently, the coastal area of Sendai, including Sendai Airport, was severely damaged in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami reportedly reached as far as Wakabayashi Ward Office, from the coastline. Thousands were killed, and countless more were injured and/or made homeless. Sendai&#x27;s port was heavily damaged and temporarily closed, reopening on 16 April 2011.

==Geography==
Sendai is located at lat. 38°16&#x27;05&quot; north, long. 140°52&#x27;11&quot; east. The city&#x27;s area is , and stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the Ōu Mountains, which are the east and west borders of Miyagi Prefecture. As a result, the city&#x27;s geography is quite diverse. Eastern Sendai is a plains area, the center of the city is hilly, and western areas are mountainous. The highest point in the city is Mount Funagata which stands above sea level. Unique among Japan&#x27;s large coastal cities, Sendai&#x27;s city core is built on a terrace at elevation.

The Sendai basin area is (the mountainous area is , the plain area is and the water body is ). The basin consists of urban areas, paddy fields and forests. The mid and upstream areas have forests. The Natori River flows through the area and reaches Sendai Bay after .

The flows through Sendai. The river is well known as a symbol of Sendai, especially because it appears in the lyrics of Aoba-jō Koi-uta (青葉城恋唄; literally, &quot;The Aoba Castle Love Song&quot;), a popular song sung by Muneyuki Satō. Aoba Castle was built close to the river to use the river as a natural moat. The river frequently flooded until the 1950s, but dams and levees constructed in the 1960s and 1970s have made such floods rare.

Most mountains in Sendai are dormant volcanoes, much older than the more famous Mount Zaō and Naruko volcanoes in nearby municipalities. However, many hot springs can be found in the city, indicating hydrothermal activity. The Miyagi Oki earthquake occurs offshore Sendai once every 25 to 40 years. The 7.2 magnitude 2005 Miyagi earthquake, which occurred on August 16, 2005, had an epicenter close to the &quot;Miyagi Oki&quot; earthquake area. However, the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion concluded that it was not the &quot;Miyagi Oki&quot; earthquake, saying &quot;...the recent event is not thought to be this earthquake. This is because the magnitude of the earthquake was small, and the source area, which was estimated from the aftershock distribution and seismic waves, didn&#x27;t cover the whole expected source region. Although, the recent event ruptured a part of the focal region of the expected earthquake.&quot; In 2011, the 9.0 magnitude 2011 Tōhoku earthquake occurred offshore Sendai, resulting in a devastating tsunami.

===Wards===
Sendai has five wards (&quot;ku&quot;), which were created when it became a designated city in 1989. The city consciously avoided names that included directions (e.g., north , center ) when it chose names for the new wards.
=== Cityscape ===


===Climate===
Sendai has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), which features warm and wet summers, and cool and dry winters. Sendai summers are not as hot as Tokyo to the south, while the winters are much milder than Sapporo to the north, but retains significant seasonal differences in temperature and rainfall. Extremes range from . Of Japan&#x27;s prefectural capitals, Sendai experiences the fewest days of extreme temperatures (highs outside ) at 19.6 per year, compared to Tokyo&#x27;s average of 49.

Winters are cool and relatively dry, with January temperatures averaging . Snowfall is much lower than cities on the Sea of Japan coast, such as Niigata and Tottori. Summers are very warm and much of the year&#x27;s precipitation is delivered at this time, with an August average of . The city is rarely hit by typhoons, and experiences only 6 days with more than of rainfall on average. Sendai&#x27;s monsoon season usually begins in late April to early October, which is later than in most cities in Japan. During this season, cold winds from the Okhotsk air mass, called &quot;Yamase&quot;, blow in and depress daytime highs.

== Demographics ==
, the city had an estimated population of 1,097,407 and a population density of 1,397 persons per km2. The city&#x27;s total area was 786.35 km2.

The 2000 National Census revealed that 88.5% of the city&#x27;s population (892,252 people) lived in a 129.69 km2 area, which is 16.6% of the city&#x27;s total area. The population density in this area was 6,879.9 persons per km2, more than 5 times higher than the city&#x27;s average population density at that time, 1,286.6 persons per km2. Approximately 10,000 people in Sendai were non-Japanese citizens.

Sendai had 525,828 households in 2020. The average household had approximately 2.07 members. The average household was becoming smaller every year, because single-member households were increasing. At this time Sendai had more people in their early 50s and in their 20s and early 30s than in other age groups. This is a result of the first and second baby booms in Japan, and university students. The average age in Sendai is 38.4, which makes the city one of the youngest major cities in Japan.

== Governance ==
Sendai&#x27;s political system is similar to other cities in Japan, because the Local Autonomy Law makes all municipalities uniform in terms of organization and power. However, Sendai is a designated city, so it has the same jurisdiction as prefectures in some areas.

Sendai has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature. The Sendai City Assembly members are elected from 5 elective districts, which correspond to the city&#x27;s 5 wards. The number of assembly members allocated to each ward is based upon population. As of May 2005, the city has 60 assembly members; 17 from Aoba Ward, 11 from Miyagino, 8 from Wakabayashi, 13 from Taihaku, and 11 from Izumi. The City Assembly elects an Assembly Chairperson and Vice Chairperson. Sendai has two vice mayors, who are not elected by the populace. Miyagi contributes 24 seats to the Miyagi Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Miyagi 1st district and the Miyagi 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

Sendai is the center of the Tōhoku region&#x27;s economy, and is the base of the region&#x27;s logistics and transportation. The GDP in Greater Sendai, Sendai Metropolitan Employment Area (1.6 million people), is US$61.7 billion in 2010. Sendai city by itself has a nominal GDP of approximately US$50 billion . The city&#x27;s economy heavily relies upon retail and services – the two industries provide approximately two thirds of the employment and close to half of the establishments.

Sendai is frequently called a branch-office economy, because very few major companies are headquartered in the city. Various authorities are cooperating to alleviate this problem, primarily by encouraging high-tech ventures from Tohoku University, which is well known for its science and engineering departments. There are also incentives for startups available from the prefectural government.

Tohoku Electric Power, a major regional supplier of electric power, has its headquarters in Sendai and also operates the Shin-Sendai Thermal Power Station located within the city.

Sendai&#x27;s economic growth rate has stabilized since the 2011 Japan earthquake. The growth rate was only 0.4% in 2011 after the quake created economic turmoil in coastal areas. The year after, in 2012 the rate spiked to 10.4% after reconstruction efforts. It has since fallen to a closer trend to what is expected of 3.7% in 2013.

Aoba-Dori is the main business road in Sendai. Other major roads in the city include Hirose-Dori (ginkgo), and Higashi-Nibancho-Dori.

===Festivals===
The most famous festival in Sendai is Tanabata, which attracts more than 2 million visitors every year and is the largest Tanabata Festival in Japan. It is relatively quiet compared to other traditional Japanese festivals, because its main attractions are intricate Tanabata decorations.

The Aoba Matsuri Festival follows more typical Japanese festival traditions, with a mikoshi, floats, a samurai parade, and traditional dancing.

Local people burn their New Year decorations and pray for health in the new year during the Dontosai Festival, the oldest festival in Miyagi Prefecture.

Various contemporary festivals also take place in Sendai, such as the Jōzenji Streetjazz Festival, the Michinoku Yosakoi Festival, and the Sendai Pageant of Starlight. The Jōzenji Streetjazz Festival is one of the largest amateur music festivals in Japan. It began as a jazz festival in 1991, but soon began to accept applications from all genres. The Michinoku Yosakoi festival is a dance festival, derived from the Yosakoi Festival that takes place in Kōchi. Trees in downtown Sendai are decorated with lights during the Sendai Pageant of Starlights. The event provided the idea for the Festival of Lights annually held in Riverside, Sendai&#x27;s sister city. In 2005, the streets were lit up with one million miniature bulbs.

===Specialties and crafts===
Sendai is the origin of several foods, including &quot;gyūtan&quot; (beef tongue, usually grilled), hiyashi chūka (cold Chinese noodles), and robatayaki (Japanese-style barbecue). However, robatayaki was later introduced to Kushiro, which developed and popularized the dish. As a result, many people believe Kushiro is the origin of Robatayaki. Zundamochi (ずんだ餅, mochi balls with sweet, bright green edamame paste), and sasakamaboko (笹かまぼこ, kamaboko shaped like bamboo leaves) are also considered to be Sendai specialties. Sendai is also known for good sashimi, sushi, and sake. This is because Sendai is near several major fishing ports, such as Kesennuma, Ishinomaki, and Shiogama, and the fact that Miyagi Prefecture is a major producer of rice. There are many ramen restaurants in Sendai, and the area is known for a particular spicy miso ramen. Also, Sendai station offers the most types of ekiben of any station in Japan. In autumn, many people organise Imonikai, a sort of picnic by the river which involves making a potato stew called &quot;Imoni&quot;.

Many crafts from Sendai were originally created under the influence of the Date family during the Edo period. Examples are Sendai Hira, a hand woven silk fabric, Tsutsumiyaki pottery, and Yanagiu Washi paper. However, some crafts, such as umoregi zaiku (crafts created from fossil wood) were developed by low-ranking samurai who needed side jobs to survive. Kokeshi dolls were popularized by hot spring resorts that sold them as gifts. Some relatively recent developments include Sendai Tsuishu lacquerware and Tamamushinuri lacquerware, both of which were developed after the Meiji Restoration.

Sendai was also known for its production of Tansu, clothing drawers made from wood with elaborate ironwork.

Although the embassy was successful in its aim of establishing relations with the Holy See, Masamune&#x27;s plans were frustrated by the suppression of Christianity in Japan. The Diocese of Sendai (previously the Diocese of Hakodate) was established in 1891, only two years after the promulgation of a new constitution guaranteeing freedom of religion in Japan, in 1889. The Bishop of Sendai currently oversees the four northern prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate and Aomori, serving 11,152 Catholics in 56 parishes.

<text>Television was introduced in Finland in 1955. Color television started in 1969 and was introduced gradually, with most programs in color by the late 1970s. All terrestrial analogue stations stopped broadcasting on 1 September 2007 after the introduction of digital television; cable providers were allowed to continue analog broadcasting in their networks until 1 March 2008.

Typically, foreign-language content is subtitled, retaining the original language soundtrack. This includes interview responses in news or magazine programmes not given in the main language of that programme. Foreign programming intended for children is, however, usually dubbed into one of the national languages. Regardless of the intended audience or original language, many shows receive a Finnish and/or Swedish title which is used in programme schedules.

In 2016 it was said that 47% of people watch via terrestrial antenna, 43% via cable, 11% via IPTV and 4% via satellite.

== History ==
On 24 May 1955, the first public television broadcast in Finland was aired by the (later ). The project eventually developed into TES-TV (later Tesvisio), the first television channel in Finland that began regular broadcasts on 21 March 1956. The public broadcaster Yleisradio began their television project in 1957, with regular broadcasts starting from 1 January 1958. &quot;Suomen Televisio&quot; (now Yle TV1), as the channel was called, also featured commercial programming from MTV, a separate channel that leased programming blocks from Yleisradio. This arrangement would last until 1993.

Yleisradio acquired Tesvisio in 1964 and reorganized its assets into a second TV channel (now Yle TV2). Despite MTV&#x27;s demands that the second channel be in their control, Yleisradio maintained ownership of the second channel but sold MTV more time on it. In 1986, a third channel Kolmoskanava was introduced as a joint venture between Yleisradio, MTV and Nokia. MTV gradually purchased Kolmoskanava into their ownership and in 1993, turned it into MTV3. Once MTV3 was introduced, MTV moved all of its programming there.

Since 2021, around 75% of the Finnish population watch television content online via YouTube, Vimeo, and other, in addition to online TV broadcasting companies.

== Digital terrestrial ==
Digital terrestrial television was launched on 21 August 2001. The analogue networks continued its broadcasts alongside the digital ones until 1 September 2007, when they were shut down nationwide.

Before the analogue switchoff, the terrestrial network had three multiplexes: MUX A, MUX B and MUX C. MUX A contained the channels of the public broadcaster Yleisradio and MUX B was shared between the two commercial broadcasters: MTV3 and Nelonen. MUX C contained channels of various other broadcasters. After the analogue closedown, a fourth multiplex named MUX E was launched.

In addition the free-to-air broadcasts, two companies are providing encryption cards for pay television: Canal Digital and PlusTV. Canal Digital was the first to launch, originally only offering four Canal+ channels (the Disney Channel was added later on). PlusTV was launched in November 2006, originally only broadcasting MTV3 Max and Subtv Juniori (later on adding Subtv Leffa and Urheilu+kanava). Both packages got more channels with the launch of MUX E in September 2007: SVT Europa and MTV3 Fakta was added to PlusTV and KinoTV was added to Canal Digital, while Discovery Channel, Eurosport, MTV Finland and Nickelodeon were added to both packages. 

September 2007 also saw the launch of the SveaTV package in Ostrobothnia which broadcasts channels from Sweden. 

The digital channel YLE Extra was closed on 31 December 2007 and was replaced by YLE TV1+, a simulcast of TV1 with subtitles included in the video stream. TV1+ was closed on 4 August 2008 due to its low viewing share.

Finland fully launched DVB-T2 in November 2024, and will exclusively use DVB-T2 starting June 2025.

==Cable==
Analogue cable television were switched off in Finland on 1 March 2008, but digital cable television is widespread all over the country and its infrastructure used for cable internet services.

The major cable operators are DNA, Welho and TTV, operating in Turku, Helsinki and Tampere areas. All pay television uses digital broadcasts, DVB-C set-top boxes have been available since 2001.

==Satellite==
Digital satellite television started in Nordic countries, and also in Finland, by Multichoice Nordic pay-TV platform during 1996. The first set-top boxes available were manufactured by Nokia and Pace. After that, the service merged with Canal Digital in late 1997. Competing pay television Viasat and Yle&#x27;s channel TV Finland started digital broadcasts in 1999. 

Canal Digital launched some HDTV channels, like Discovery HD, on their digital paytv-package during 2006. Pan-European HDTV-channel Euro1080 HD1 is available also in Finland. 

== List of channels ==
All Yle channels are broadcast free-to-air and so are a few commercial ones including MTV3, Nelonen, MTV Sub, Jim, TV5, Star Channel and Kutonen. Yle channels are state owned and are funded by a ring fenced so-called &quot;Yle tax&quot;.

Most of the channels are the same throughout mainland Finland. In Ostrobothnia and Åland there is an extra multiplex available which provides encrypted channels from Sweden, along with respective local stations, and of course due to overlapping signals, Russian, Swedish, Norwegian and Estonian stations are able to be seen near the border areas and vice versa.

<text>was a city located in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It is now part of the city of Isa. The city was founded on April 1, 1954.

As of 2008, the city had an estimated population of 21,643 and the density of 78.02 persons per km2. The total area was 291.88 km2.

On November 1, 2008, Ōkuchi was merged with the town of Hishikari (from Isa District) to create the city of Isa. Isa District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

Ōkuchi was the northernmost city on the mainland part of Kagoshima Prefecture. Only the Nagashima island of Nagashima city extends further north. Ōkuchi is a mountainous area that borders on Kumamoto Prefecture and Miyazaki Prefecture. Part of the southern border of the city is the Sendai River and the artificial lake formed from the Tsuruta dam. It is the only city in Kagoshima Prefecture that is not bordered by the sea.

At one time, Ōkuchi was a prosperous city but has declined for several reasons in recent years. First, there has been a decline in forestry and agriculture in the area, but the aging Japanese population and the flight to larger cities have also been significant factors. For these reasons two Japanese National Railways railway lines that served Ōkuchi were discontinued in the 1987 and 1988. They were the Yamano line that went from Minamata to Kurino and the Miyajo line that went from Sendai to Ōkuchi.

<doc id="329668" wikidata="Q310973" url="?curid=329668" title="Lorenzo Lotto">
<text>Lorenzo Lotto (c. 1480 – 1556/57) was an Italian Renaissance painter, draughtsman, and illustrator, traditionally placed in the Venetian school, though much of his career was spent in other north Italian cities. He painted mainly altarpieces, religious subjects and portraits. He was active during the High Renaissance and the first half of the Mannerist period, but his work maintained a generally similar High Renaissance style throughout his career, although his nervous and eccentric posings and distortions represented a transitional stage to the Florentine and Roman Mannerists.

==Overview==
During his lifetime Lotto was a well-respected painter and certainly popular in Northern Italy; he is traditionally included in the Venetian School, but his independent career actually places him outside the Venetian art scene. He was certainly not as highly regarded in Venice as in the other towns where he worked, for he had a stylistic individuality, even an idiosyncratic style (although it fits within the parametres of High Renaissance painting), and, after his death, he gradually became neglected and then almost forgotten. This oblivion could be attributed to the fact that his works now remain in lesser known churches or in provincial museums.

==Biography==
Born in Venice, he worked in Treviso (1503–1506); in the Marche (1506–1508); in Rome (1508–1510); in Bergamo (1513–1525); in Venice (1525–1549); in Ancona (1549), and finally, as a Franciscan lay brother, in Loreto (1549–1556).

===Apprenticeship===
Little is known of his training. As a Venetian he was influenced by Giovanni Bellini as he had a good knowledge of contemporary Venetian painting. Though Bellini was doubtless not his teacher, the influence is clear in his early painting &quot;Virgin and Child with St. Jerome&quot; (1506; National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh). However, in his portraits and in his early painting &quot;Allegory of Virtue and Vice&quot; (1505; National Gallery of Art, Washington), he shows the influence of Giorgione&#x27;s Naturalism. As he grew older his style changed, perhaps evolving, from a detached Giorgionesque classicism, to a more vibrant dramatic setpiece, more reminiscent of his contemporary from Parma, Correggio.

===Treviso (1503–1506)===
Lotto soon left Venice, because there the competition for a young painter would have been too great, with established names such as Giorgione, Palma the Elder and certainly with Titian. Nevertheless, Giorgio Vasari mentions in the third part of his book &quot;Vite&quot; that Lotto was a friend of Palma the Elder. In Treviso, a prospering town within the domain of the republic of Venice, he came under the patronage of bishop Bernardo de&#x27; Rossi. The already mentioned painting &quot;Allegory of Virtue and Vice&quot; was intended as an allegorical cover of his portrait (1505) of the bishop (now in National Museum of Capodimonte in Naples), who had survived an assassination attempt. The painting &quot;St. Jerome in the Desert&quot; (1500 or 1506; Louvre, Paris) shows his youthful inexperience as a draughtsman, however the dramatic rocky landscape is accentuated by the red garment of the saint, while at the same time giving an early impression of his skill as a miniaturist. He painted his first altarpieces for the parish church San Cristina al Tiverone (1505) and the baptistery of the Cathedral of Asolo (1506), both still on display in those churches.

===Recanati (1506–1508) and Rome (1508–1510)===
In 1508 he began the Recanati Polyptych altarpiece for the church of San Domenico; this two-tiered and rather conventionally painted polyptych consists of six panels. His portrait &quot;Young Man against a White Curtain&quot; in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (c. 1506) and &quot;Adoration of the Child&quot; (c. 1508) in the National Museum in Kraków with Catherine Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus portraited as Saint Catherine, are paintings from this period.
As he became a respected painter, he came to the attention of Bramante, the papal architect, who was passing through Loreto (a pilgrimage site near Recanati). Lotto was invited to Rome to decorate the papal apartments, but nothing survives of this work, as it was destroyed a few years later. This was probably because he had imitated the style of Raphael, a rapidly rising star in the Papal court; indeed he had done it before, in the &quot;Transfiguration&quot; of the Recanati polyptych.

===The Marche (1511–1513) and Bergamo (1513–1525)===
In 1511 he was at work for the confraternity of the Buon Gesù in Jesi, painting an &quot;Entombment&quot; (Pinacoteca Civica, Jesi); soon after he was painting altarpieces in Recanati: a &quot;Transfiguration&quot; (c.1512, now in the Pinacoteca Comunale, Recanati and a fresco (&quot;St Vincent Ferrer&quot;) for the church of San Domenico. His work in Bergamo, the westernmost town of the Venetian republic, was to prove his best and most productive artistic period, when he received many commissions from wealthy merchants, well educated professionals and local aristocrats. He had become a rich colourist and an experienced draughtsman, who also developed the concept of the psychological portrait that revealed the thoughts and emotions of his subjects. In this he was continuing the tradition begun by Antonello da Messina and a good example would be his &quot;Portrait of a Young Man with a Book&quot; (now in the Accademia, Venice). He began 1513 with a monumental altarpiece: the &quot;Martinengo Altarpiece&quot; in the Dominican church of the Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano in Bergamo. This altarpiece was commissioned by Count Alessandro Martinengo-Colleoni, grandson of the famous condottiere Bartolomeo Colleoni, which would be finished in 1516 and shows us the influence of Bramante and Giorgione. His next assignment was the decoration of the churches of S Bernardino and of Sant&#x27;Alessandro in Colonna, with frescoes and distemper paintings. He would finish five more altarpieces between 1521 and 1523. In 1523 he went for a brief stay in the Marche, obtaining there several commissions for altarpieces, which he would paint during his stay in Venice.

His next works are mostly wall paintings: in 1524 he painted a series of frescoes with the lives of saints (such as Saint Barbara) in the Suardi Chapel in Trescore (near Bergamo). In the details he depicts scenes of each saint&#x27;s life, such as in the fresco &quot;Martyrdom of St. Claire&quot;. In the same fresco he portrays Christ with vines sprouting from his hands, illustrating the words of the New Testament: &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches&quot;. In 1524 he also painted cartoons with Old Testament stories, as models for the intarsia panels for the choir stalls of Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo.

More than 20 private paintings date from the same period; they are mostly of religious and pious subjects, such as &quot;Madonnas&quot; or a &quot;Deposition&quot;, used for worship at home. Though he painted in the Classical tradition, Lotto adds a personal touch to the intense emotions. Using contrasting poses and opposing movement, he breaks the traditional symmetry of the Virgin surrounded by angels and saints.

===Venice (1525–1532)===
In Venice, Lotto first resided at the Dominican monastery of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, but he was forced to leave after a few months after a conflict with intarsia artist Fra Damiano da Bergamo. To cope with the many commissions he started to receive, he founded a workshop. He shipped five altarpieces for churches in the Marche and another one for the church Santa Maria Assunta in Celano (near Bergamo). Another altarpiece was for the Venetian church of Santa Maria dei Carmini, portraying &quot;St. Nicholas of Bari in Glory&quot;.

As Venice was a city of great wealth and as popularity increased, he received many orders for private paintings, including ten portraits, among them, &quot;Portrait of a Young Man&quot; (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin). His portrait of &quot;Andrea Odoni&quot; (Royal Art Collection, Hampton Court) (1527) would later influence the portrait of &quot;Jacopo Strada&quot; by Titian (1568) (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). But in Venice he was overshadowed by Titian, who dominated the artistic scene.

===Venice, the Veneto and the Marche (1532–1556)===
In this last period of his life, Lorenzo Lotto would frequently move from town to town, searching for patrons and commissions. In 1532 he went to Treviso. Next he spent about seven years in the Marche (Ancona, Macerata and Jesi), before returning to Venice in 1540. He moved again to Treviso in 1542 and back to Venice in 1545. Finally he went back to Ancona in 1549.

This was a productive period in his life, during which he painted several altarpieces and portraits.

At the end of his life, Lotto found it difficult to earn a living. Furthermore, in 1550, when he was about 70, one of his works had an unsuccessful auction in Ancona. As recorded in his personal account book, this deeply disillusioned him. As he had always been a deeply religious man, in 1552 he joined the Holy Sanctuary at Loreto, becoming a lay brother. During that time he decorated the basilica of Santa Maria and painted a &quot;Presentation in the Temple&quot; for the Palazzo Apostolico in Loreto. He died in 1556 and was buried, at his request, in a Dominican habit.

Giorgio Vasari included Lotto&#x27;s biography in the third volume of his book &quot;Vite&quot;. Lorenzo Lotto himself left many letters and a detailed notebook (&quot;Libro di spese diverse&quot;, 1538–1556), giving insight to his life and work. His influence was felt by many painters, including probably Giovanni Busi, and Ercole Ramazzani, born in Arcevia and active near Jesi. Another pupil was Durante Nobili.

Thanks to the work of the art historian Bernard Berenson, Lotto was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century. Since then, many monographs and several exhibitions have been dedicated to Lorenzo Lotto, such as the exhibition in Venice in 1953 and one in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, USA, in 1998.

The American occupation forces abolished Nodake City in 1946, and renamed the area Ginowan Village. Subsequently, the occupation authorities confiscated the main areas of Ginowan to build military bases. The area became a base town with military bases centered in Nodaka and Futenma.

Around 33% of Ginowan has been leased by the Japanese Ministry of Defense for use as a US military base under the Japanese and American mutual defense agreement. and hosts Marine Corps Air Station Futenma and part of the Marine Corps&#x27; Camp Foster.

<text>, (Miyako: &quot;Pїsara&quot;) was a city located in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan on the island of Miyako. As of 2003, the city had an estimated population of 33,861 and a density of 521.58 persons per km2. The total area was 64.92 km2.

== History ==
Hirara was founded on March 7, 1947.

On October 1, 2005, Hirara, along with the towns of Gusukube, Irabu and Shimoji, and the village of Ueno (all from Miyako District), was merged to create the city of Miyakojima. This merger was one of a large number of mergers that was conducted in 2005, which was nicknamed &quot;the great Heisei mergers&quot;.

The merger was conducted by the &quot;Miyako District Municipal Merger Council&quot;, which was responsible for planning mergers in Miyako District. Before the merger, the district consisted of all of the Miyako Islands, but now (after the merger) it only consists of Tarama Village.

<doc id="329679" wikidata="Q714339" url="?curid=329679" title="Ishigaki Island">
<text>, also known as &quot;Ishigakijima&quot;, is a Japanese island south-west of Okinawa Hontō and the second-largest island of the Yaeyama Island group, behind Iriomote Island. It is located approximately south-west of Okinawa Hontō. It is within the City of Ishigaki in Okinawa Prefecture. The city functions as the business and transport center of the archipelago. The island is served by New Ishigaki Airport, the largest airport in the Yaeyamas.

Much of the island and surrounding waters including Mount Omoto and Kabira Bay are protected as part of Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park.

Ishigaki Island, like the rest of Okinawa, is culturally influenced by both Japan and Taiwan due to its location, about off the north eastern coast of Taiwan.

==History==
A tsunami of record height hit Ishigaki Island in 1771.

One of the perpetrators of Aum Shinrikyo&#x27;s sarin gas attack, Yasuo Hayashi, was arrested on Ishigaki Island 21 months after the attacks and from the scene of the crime.

On 11 April 2024, locals protested against the Japanese military&#x27;s presence.

==Ishigaki Port==
Located southwest of Okinawa Island and east of Keelung, Ishigaki serves as a gateway to the Yaeyama Islands. Ishigaki Port is the 5th most popular of Japan&#x27;s cruise ports as of 2017, and 4th for port calls by non-Japanese ships with a weekly call by Star Cruises from Taiwan. Several companies offer daily ferry service to Hateruma, Iriomote, Kohama, and Taketomi Island.

Due to Japan&#x27;s increased focus on grey-zone challenges, Ishigaki Port has been expanded so more than a dozen large (over 1,000 tons) Japan Coast Guard ships can be stationed there. There are currently 11 &quot;Kunigami-class&quot; large patrol vessels and 2 &quot;Hateruma-class&quot; large patrol vessels, as well as a &quot;Bizan-class&quot; small patrol vessel, and a &quot;Kagayuki-class&quot; patrol craft have been homeported at Ishigaki along with facilities for housing up to 600 crew, making Ishigaki JCG&#x27;s largest base, surpassing JCG&#x27;s facilities in Yokohama.

Tokyo has currently earmarked ¥21.2 billion yen (US$205 million) in FY2021 to build new patrol boats and buy helicopters for the region, with plans to assign 22 ships of over 1,000 tons (including the 3 &quot;Tsugarus&quot;, a &quot;Kunigami&quot;, and a &quot;Hateruma&quot; class patrol vessel based in Naha) in the region by 2024. Tokyo has also bulked up the JCG presence on Miyako-jima between Ishigaki and Naha with nine &quot;Shimoji-class&quot; small patrol vessels and a &quot;Tokara-class&quot; medium patrol vessel

The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) are also considering deploying short range anti-ship missiles (possibly the Type 96 multi-purpose missile system) on the island.

These reinforcements are mostly in relation to the Japanese uninhabited Senkaku Islands, which lie north of Ishigaki and are under the control of the mayor of Ishigaki, which has been given civic authority over the territory since the Senkaku Islands reverted from the US to the Japanese government control in 1972. China and to a lesser extent Taiwan have challenged Japan&#x27;s sovereignty over these islands since 1972, with more intensity since 2012.

==Culture==
* Miyaradunchi is a residence erected around 1819 by the local governor, it has been designated an Important Cultural Property as representative of the architecture of the Yaeyama Islands.

==Food==
Ishigaki has different cuisine from mainland Japan. Due to the relative warmth of the surrounding sea and various cultural influences, the food of Ishigaki and Okinawa is more meat-centered than the rest of Japan. The Ryukyu Kingdom served as an important trading post between Japan and the rest of the world despite various trading bans between Japan and China.

Located only from Taiwan, Okinawan cuisine is best defined by the Okinawan word &quot;Chanpurū&quot; (チャンプルー) or &quot;something mixed&quot;, incorporating aspects of Chinese, Japanese, Southeast Asian, and American cultures. Although Okinawa is best known for its love of pig, Ishigaki is famous for its Japanese Black cattle, both which are thought to have originally been brought from China as far back as the Yayoi period. Ishigaki is also unique in its use of spice and tropical fruits mainland Japanese palates tend to be unaccustomed with.

==Flora==
&quot;Satakentia liukiuensis&quot;, the only species in the genus &quot;Satakentia&quot;, is a palm tree that is endemic to the two islands of Ishigaki and Iriomote in the Yaeyama Islands.

<doc id="329680" wikidata="Q695895" url="?curid=329680" title="Urasoe, Okinawa">
<text>is a city located in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The neighboring municipalities are Naha to the south, Ginowan to the north, and Nishihara to the east. As of February 2024, the city has an estimated population of 115,518 and a population density of 6,051.2 persons per km2. The total area is 19.09 km2.

United States Marine Corps base Camp Kinser is located on the city&#x27;s coast.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Urasoe&quot; is made up of two kanji characters. The first, , means &quot;a coastal area&quot;, and the second, , means &quot;ruling&quot; or &quot;uniting&quot;. The name is a reference to &quot;ruling over many areas&quot;.

However, what appears to be an older form of this word is attested in Old Okinawan under the forms &quot;*uraosoi&quot; うらおそい and &quot;*uraosoe&quot; うらおそへ.

==Geography==
Urasoe sits to the south of Okinawa Island. Urasoe is rugged and hilly to the east, and the city slopes gently to the East China Sea in the west. Urasoe, while formerly agricultural, has become heavily urbanized due to its proximity to the prefectural capital of Naha.

==History==
Urasoe was the original capital of the Okinawan kingdom of Chūzan for several centuries until it was supplanted by Shuri in the late 14th or early 15th century. Shunten (1166–1237), the first known king of the Chuzan Kingdom, located in the central region of the island of Okinawa, ruled from Urasoe, as did his son and grandson. For much of the 14th century, Urasoe Castle was the largest on the island of Okinawa. The castle now contains the remains of several kings of the Ryukyu Kingdom.

Urasoe was completely razed during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 at the end of World War II. 45% of the population, 4,117 residents, died during the battle. The village office of Urasoe was re-established in 1946 to conduct basic administrative functions, settle refugees returning to the village, and restore agricultural land. The village saw a significant increase in U.S. military presence in 1950 in the western coast of the village, which eventually became Camp Kinser. The population of Urasoe rapidly from 1956, and the city became a bedroom community of Naha in this period. Urasoe was elevated to city status on July 1, 1970.

==Climate==
Nago has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with very warm summers and mild winters. Precipitation is abundant throughout the year; the wettest month is August and the driest month is December.

==History==
Nago Castle was built in the 14th century and served as the home of the Aji of Nago Magiri. Nago had always been one of the major settlements in Northern Okinawa, and a major port along with Unten. Nago Magiri became Nago town in 1907. Nago was upgraded to city status on August 1, 1970 with the merger of nine smaller towns and villages.

Nago hosted Expo &#x27;75 in a park which utilized a monorail train to move tourists to each exhibit. Its most popular exhibit was the Japanese Floating City; similar to an oil rig, the city floated on large pontoons which allowed it to be moved. If the city was threatened with a typhoon, it would move close to shore, fill the pontoons with sea water and sit on the ocean floor for more stability. The city was self sufficient, and used the ocean floor for cultivating seaweed and other edible plants. Nago also hosted the 26th G8 summit in 2000.

Nago is the site of Camp Schwab, a United States Marine Corps base established in 1956. It has gained national attention in Japan due to the controversy surrounding the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan, as there have been proposals at various times to relocate the base to a new site adjacent to or within Camp Schwab, most recently in April 2013. The January 19, 2014 mayoral election in Nago became a de facto referendum on the April 2013 relocation plan, with incumbent mayor Susumu Inamine opposing the plan and his challenger, former Vice Mayor Bunshin Suematsu, supporting the plan.
== Tourism ==
Nago is a tourist town. The many beaches draw Okinawans, mainland Japanese, Americans and other tourists to the northern part of the island. The main beach, known as Nago beach, is located on highway 58 in 21st Century Park. The facilities have showers, washrooms, and vending machines, and sites can be rented for picnics or barbecues. There is a lifeguard on duty and a net in the water to prevent harmful sea creatures from entering the swimming area.

A popular tourist destination is the Pineapple Park which is located on route 84. Right beside the Pineapple Park is Okinawa Fruits land. Pineapple Park is an interactive museum where visitors can see how pineapple is grown, and how pineapple wine is made. There is also a collection of thousands of seashells.

Okinawa Fruits Land is a conservatory with many plants, birds and fruits. A map is provided and tourists can wander through the park as they wish. There are many types of tropical birds.

The corals and seagrass beds of the east coast of Nago are home to the last remaining population of dugong in Japan.

Nago also hosts the international bicycle race known as the Tour de Okinawa, which is usually held in November.

Since 1959, Nago has hosted the Nago 1/2 marathon race in February.

Because of Nago&#x27;s sub tropical environment, cherry blossoms bloom early in the year. Nago is always one of the first cities to host the cherry blossom festival every year in January.

==Economy==
Nago established itself as a tax haven for financial companies in 2002, following the example of Dublin, Ireland. The Nago Multimedia Building was established as the core of this zone, with various subsidies for foreign financial firms to establish offices there.

Orion Breweries has its factory in Nago. The city is also noted for the production of cement, rice, sugarcane, and pineapples.

==Education==
Founded as a private university, the now public Meio University is located in Nago. The National Institute of Technology, Okinawa College is also located in Nago.

==Cultural Properties==
Nago City hosts sixty-three designated or registered cultural properties and monuments, at the national, prefectural or municipal level.

<doc id="329685" wikidata="Q4643871" url="?curid=329685" title="7 Rideau Gate">
<text>7 Rideau Gate is the Canadian government&#x27;s official state guest house for very important dignitaries, such as visiting heads of government or other high-level officials. The house is located in Ottawa, Ontario, near other official residences such as Rideau Hall and 24 Sussex Drive.

Due to ongoing renovations at Rideau Hall, 7 Rideau Gate served from October 2017 as a residence for then Governor General Julie Payette, who resigned on January 22, 2021.

==History==
The house was built in 1862 for Henry Osgoode Burritt, an Ottawa woollen mill owner. Burritt sold the house in 1873, for the sum of $10,000, to Philemon Wetherall Wright, who named the house &#x27;Edgewood&#x27; in acknowledgement of its location (then) at the edge of the town.

The Wrights departed Edgewood three years later, leaving it vacant until it was purchased in 1884 by Octavius Henry Lambart, a son of the 8th Earl of Cavan. The Lambarts remained in the house until 1934, passing it to Octavius&#x27; son, Frederick Howard John Lambart.

Commodore Percy W. Nelles, Chief of Staff of the Royal Canadian Navy, became the occupant of 7 Rideau Gate in 1947. He renovated the house to remove its verandas and gut its Victorian interiors.

The last private owner was Thomas Franklin Ahearn (son of the inventor Thomas Ahearn), who further altered the structure by removing the roof walk and adding exterior shutters, a sunroom on the east side of the original building, and a wing on the west side. Ahearn&#x27;s daughter Lilias, who grew up in the house, would later become the châtelaine of Rideau Hall during her father-in-law Vincent Massey&#x27;s term as Governor General of Canada.

The property was acquired by the Crown in 1966. The house was, with the assistance of the Canadiana Fund, restored and renovated in 1989 to reinstate historical features, as well as to upgrade the guest facilities. Art and furniture from the National Capital Commission&#x27;s (NCC) Official Residences Crown Collection are used throughout, as are pieces donated by the Lambart family.

==Current use==
Since 1966, 7 Rideau Gate has generally been used as a guest house for high-level foreign officials who are visiting Canada in an official capacity as guests of the Canadian government. The hospitality offered by the Crown comes via Global Affairs Canada.

However, due to renovation work at Rideau Hall that began in September 2017, the house served from October 2017 as a residence for the Governor General at that time, Julie Payette.

<doc id="329686" wikidata="Q208863" url="?curid=329686" title="Hachiōji">
<text>is a city located in the western portion of the Tokyo Metropolis, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 561,344, and a population density of 3,000 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . It is the most populous city in Tokyo outside of the special wards.
In 2015, it was designated as a core city for the first time in Tokyo. It was the second first city in Tokyo Prefecture (present-day Tokyo) to implement the municipal system after Tokyo City (present-day Tokyo&#x27;s 23 wards).

==Geography==

Hachiōji is located in the foothills of the Okutama Mountains of western Tokyo, about 40 kilometers west of the center of the 23 special wards of Tokyo. The city is surrounded on three sides by mountains, forming the Hachioji Basin which opens up toward the east in the direction of Tokyo. The mountain ranges in the southwest include Mount Takao (599 m) and Mount Jinba (857 m), two popular hiking destinations which can be reached by train and bus, respectively.

===Surrounding municipalities===
Kanagawa Prefecture
*Sagamihara
Tokyo Metropolis
*Akiruno
*Akishima
*Fussa
*Hino
*Hinohara
*Machida
*Tama

===Climate===

The average annual rainfall is 1998 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.3 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.4 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hachiōji has recently plateaued after nine decades of strong growth.

==History==
The area of present-day Hachiōji was part of ancient Musashi Province. It has been an important junction point and post town along the &quot;Kōshū Kaidō&quot;, the main road that connected the historical Edo (today&#x27;s Tokyo) with western Japan. Hachiōji Castle was built during the Sengoku period in 1584 by Hōjō Ujiteru, but was destroyed in 1590 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. During the Edo period, the area was &quot;tenryō&quot; controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. In the post-Meiji Restoration cadastral reform of July 22, 1878, the area became part of Minamitama District in Kanagawa Prefecture. The town of Hachiōji was created on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Minaitama District was transferred to the administrative control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893. Hachiōji gained city status on September 1, 1917.

During the 1964 Summer Olympics, the city played host to the road cycling events. A velodrome in the city played host to the track cycling events.

Hachiōji became a Core city on April 1, 2015 with increased local autonomy.

==Government==
Hachiōji has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 40 members, whose members are elected for a four-year term. Hachiōji contributes five members to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Tokyo 21st district and Tokyo 24th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

=== Mayors of Hachiōji (1917–present) ===



==Economy==
During the Meiji period, Hachiōji prospered as an important location for the production of silk and silk textiles. The industry faded away, however, in the 1960s. Today, Hachiōji mainly serves as a commuter town for people working in Tokyo, and as a location for many large colleges and universities.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Akishima has increased steadily over the past century.

==History==
The area of present-day Akishima was part of ancient Musashi Province, and a center for sericulture. In the post–Meiji Restoration cadastral reform of July 22, 1878, the area became part of Kitatama District in Kanagawa Prefecture. Haiji, Nakagami, and Sotoyatsu villages were created on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The entire district was transferred to the control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893. The latter two villages merged on January 1, 1928, to form Shōwa Village. Following the dedication of Tachikawa Airfield, which was established in 1922, the surrounding area developed in the 1930s with large-scale munitions factories for aircraft manufacturing for the Imperial Japanese Army.

Shōwa was elevated to town status on January 1, 1941, and through merger with the village of Haiji on May 1, 1954, became the city of Akishima. The name comes from the &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; of the first &quot;kanji&quot; in the name of the former town of Shōwa, and the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; of the second &quot;kanji&quot; in the name of the former village of Haijima.

==Government==
Akishima has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Akishima contributes one member to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Tokyo 25th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.
