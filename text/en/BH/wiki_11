<text>The San Fernando Valley, known locally as the Valley, is an urbanized valley in Los Angeles County, California. Situated northwards of the Los Angeles Basin, it comprises a large portion of Los Angeles, the incorporated cities of Burbank, Calabasas, Glendale, Hidden Hills and San Fernando, plus several unincorporated areas. The valley is the home of Warner Bros. Studios, Walt Disney Studios, and the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park.

==Geography==

The valley of San Fernando is an area of , bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains in the northeast, the Verdugo Mountains in the east, the Santa Monica Mountains and Chalk Hills in the south, the Simi Hills in the west, and the Santa Susana Mountains in the northwest. The northern Sierra Pelona Mountains, northwestern Topatopa Mountains, southern Santa Ana Mountains, and Downtown Los Angeles skyscrapers can be seen from higher neighborhoods, passes, roads and parks in the San Fernando Valley.

The Los Angeles River begins at the confluence of Calabasas Creek (&quot;Arroyo Calabasas&quot;) and Bell Creek (&quot;Escorpión Creek&quot;), between Canoga Park High School and Owensmouth Avenue (just north of Vanowen Street) in Canoga Park. These creeks&#x27; headwaters are in the Santa Monica Calabasas foothills, the Simi Hills&#x27; Hidden Hills, Santa Susana Field Laboratory, and Santa Susana Pass Park lands. The river flows eastward along the southern regions of the Valley. One of the river&#x27;s two unpaved sections can be found at the Sepulveda Basin. A seasonal river, the Tujunga Wash, drains much of the western facing San Gabriel Mountains and passes into and then through the Hansen Dam Recreation Center in Lake View Terrace. It flows south along the Verdugo Mountains through the eastern communities of the valley to join the Los Angeles River in Studio City. Other notable tributaries of the river include Dayton Creek, Caballero Creek, Bull Creek, Pacoima Wash, and Verdugo Wash. The elevation of the floor of the valley varies from about to above sea level.

Most of the San Fernando Valley is within the jurisdiction of the City of Los Angeles, although a few other incorporated cities are located within the valley as well: Burbank is in the southeastern corner of the valley, and San Fernando, which is completely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles, is near the northern end of the valley. Universal City, an enclave in the southern part of the valley, is an unincorporated area housing the Universal Studios filming lot and theme park. Mulholland Drive, which runs along the ridgeline of the Santa Monica Mountains, marks the boundary between the valley and the communities of Hollywood and the Los Angeles Westside.
The San Fernando Valley has connections to other regions: the Santa Clarita Valley via Newhall Pass, the Westside via Sepulveda Pass, Hollywood via Cahuenga Pass, Simi Valley via Santa Susana Pass, and the Crescenta Valley via Interstate 210.

===Habitat===
The valley&#x27;s natural habitat is a &quot;temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome&quot; of grassland, oak savanna, and chaparral shrub types of plant community habitats, along with lush riparian plants along the river, creeks, and springs. In this Mediterranean climate, post-1790s European agriculture for the mission&#x27;s support consisted of grapes, figs, olives, and general garden crops.

===Climate===
The San Fernando Valley has a subtropical/hot-summer Mediterranean climate, with long, hot, dry summers, and short, mild winters, with chilly nights and sporadic rainfall. Due to its relatively inland location and other factors, summer days are typically hotter and winter nights typically colder than in the Los Angeles basin. More recently, statewide droughts in California have further strained the San Fernando Valley’s and Los Angeles County’s water security.


==History==

===Pre-California statehood===
The valley was a center of &quot;the crossroads of cultures and languages, including the Tongva, Fernandeño, and Chumash.&quot; The Tongva, later known as the Gabrieleño Mission Indians after colonization, the Tataviam to the north, and Chumash to the west, had lived and thrived in the valley and its arroyos for over 8,000 years. They had numerous settlements, and trading and hunting camps, before the Spanish arrived in 1769 to settle in the Valley, including the village of Pasheeknga.

The first Spanish land grant in the San Fernando Valley (or &quot;El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bononia de los Encinos&quot;) was called &quot;Rancho Encino&quot; (present-day Mission Hills on the &quot;Camino Viejo&quot; before Newhall Pass), in the northern part of the San Fernando Valley. Juan Francisco Reyes built an adobe dwelling beside a Tongva village or rancheria at natural springs known as Achooykomenga, but the land was soon taken from him so that a mission could be built there. Mission San Fernando Rey de España was established in 1797 as the 17th of the 21 missions. The land trade granted Juan Francisco Reyes the similarly named Rancho Los Encinos, also beside springs (Los Encinos State Historic Park in present-day Encino). Later the Mexican land grants of Rancho El Escorpión (West Hills), Rancho Providencia and Rancho Cahuenga (Burbank), and Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando (rest of valley) covered the San Fernando Valley.

The Treaty of Cahuenga, ending the Mexican–American War fighting in Alta California, was signed in 1847 by Californios and Americans at Campo de Cahuenga, the Verdugo Family adobe at the entrance to the Cahuenga Pass in the southeast San Fernando Valley (North Hollywood). The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the entire war.

===California statehood and beyond===
The Valley officially became part of the State of California on September 9, 1850, when the California Statehood Act was approved by the federal government.
In 1874, dry wheat farming was introduced by J. B. Lankershim and Isaac Van Nuys, which became very productive for their San Fernando Homestead Association that owned the southern half of the valley. In 1876, they sent the first wheat shipment from both San Pedro Harbor and from the United States to Europe.

===20th century===
====Aqueduct====


Through the late-19th-century court decision &quot;Los Angeles&quot; v. &quot;Pomeroy&quot;, Los Angeles had won the rights to all surface flow water atop an aquifer beneath the valley, without it being within the city limits. San Fernando Valley farmers offered to buy the surplus aqueduct water, but the federal legislation that enabled the construction of the aqueduct prohibited Los Angeles from selling the water outside of the city limits. This induced several independent towns surrounding Los Angeles to vote on and approve annexation to the city so that they could connect to the municipal water system. These rural areas became part of Los Angeles in 1915.
The aqueduct water shifted farming in the area from dry crops, such as wheat, to irrigated crops, such as corn, beans, squash, and cotton; orchards of apricots, persimmons, and walnuts; and major citrus groves of oranges and lemons. They continued until the next increment of development converted land use, with postwar suburbanization leaving only a few enclaves, such as the &quot;open-air museum&quot; groves at the Orcutt Ranch Park and CSUN campus.

====Developments====

In 1909, the Suburban Homes Company, a syndicate led by H. J. Whitley, general manager of the board of control, along with Harry Chandler, Harrison Gray Otis, M. H. Sherman, and Otto F. Brant purchased 48,000 acres of the Farming and Milling Company for $2,500,000. Henry E. Huntington extended his Pacific Electric Railway (Red Cars) through the Valley to Owensmouth (now Canoga Park). The Suburban Home Company laid out plans for roads and the towns of Van Nuys, Reseda (Marian), and Canoga Park (Owensmouth). The rural areas were annexed into the city of Los Angeles in 1915. Laurel Canyon and Lankershim in 1923, Sunland in 1926, La Tuna Canyon in 1926, and the incorporated city of Tujunga in an eight-year process lasting from 1927 to 1935. These annexations more than doubled the area of the city.

Two valley cities incorporated independently from Los Angeles: Burbank and San Fernando in 1911. Universal City remains an unincorporated enclave that is home to Universal Studios and became home to Universal CityWalk later in the century. Other unincorporated areas in the valley include Bell Canyon and Kagel Canyon.

The advent of three new industries in the early 20th century—motion pictures, automobiles, and aircraft—also spurred urbanization and population growth. World War II production and the subsequent postwar boom accelerated this growth so that between 1945 and 1960, the valley&#x27;s population had quintupled. Los Angeles continued to consolidate its territories in the San Fernando Valley by annexing the former Rancho El Escorpión for Canoga Park-West Hills in 1959, and the huge historic Porter Ranch at the foot of the Santa Susana Mountains for the new planned developments in Porter Ranch in 1965. The additions expanded the Los Angeles portion of San Fernando Valley from the original to .

In the late 1970s, there was a proposed east-west freeway labeled SR 64 that would have cut through the center of the valley from Calabasas in the western end of the valley to the SR-170 and I-5 freeway interchange in Sun Valley, Los Angeles in the eastern end of the valley, but local opposition gained traction and the proposed freeway was never approved or built.

====Pop culture====
In the 1980s, a distinctive valley youth culture was recognized in the media, particularly in the 1982 Frank Zappa / Moon Zappa song &quot;Valley Girl&quot; and the 1983 film &quot;Valley Girl&quot;. These helped fix the socio-economic stereotype of the &quot;Valley girl&quot; into the public consciousness, including a distinct Valley accent.

====Northridge earthquake====

The 1994 Northridge earthquake struck on January 17 and measured 6.7 on the Moment magnitude scale. It produced the largest ground motions ever recorded in an urban environment and was the first earthquake that had its hypocenter located directly under a U.S. city since the Long Beach earthquake of 1933. It caused the greatest damage in the United States since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Although given the name Northridge, the epicenter was located in the community of Reseda, between Arminta and Ingomar streets, just west of Reseda Boulevard. The death toll was 57, and more than 1,500 people were seriously injured. A few days after the earthquake, 9,000 homes and businesses were still without electricity; 20,000 were without gas; and more than 48,500 had little or no water. About 12,500 structures were moderately to severely damaged, which left thousands of people temporarily homeless. Of the 66,546 buildings inspected, 6 percent were severely damaged (red tagged) and 17 percent were moderately damaged (yellow tagged). In addition, damage to several major freeways serving Los Angeles choked the traffic system in the days following the earthquake. Major freeway damage occurred as far away as from the epicenter. Collapses and other severe damage forced closure of portions of 11 major roads to downtown Los Angeles.

This was the second time in 23 years that the San Fernando Valley had been affected by a strong earthquake. On February 9, 1971, at 6:01 a.m., a magnitude 6.5 event struck about northeast of the epicenter of the 1994 event in the area of Sylmar. The 1971 earthquake caused 58 fatalities and about 2,000 injuries. At the time, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake was the most destructive event to affect greater Los Angeles since the magnitude-6.3 Long Beach earthquake of 1933.

===Independence movement===
The Valley attempted to secede in the 1970s, but the state passed a law barring city formation without the approval of the City Council. In 1997, Assemblymen Bob Hertzberg and Tom McClintock helped pass a bill that would make it easier for the Valley to secede by removing the City Council veto. AB 62 was signed into law by Governor Pete Wilson. Meanwhile, a grassroots movement to split the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and create new San Fernando Valley-based school districts became the focal point of the desire to leave the city. Though the state rejected the idea of Valley-based districts, it remained an important rallying point for Hertzberg&#x27;s mayoral campaign, which proved unsuccessful.

===21st century===
By the late 1990s, the San Fernando Valley had become more urban and more ethnically diverse with rising poverty and crime. In 2002, the valley again tried to secede from the city of Los Angeles and become its own independent, incorporated city to escape Los Angeles&#x27; perceived poverty, crime, gang activity, urban decay, and poorly maintained infrastructure. The movement gained some momentum, but Measure F did not receive the necessary votes to pass. Since that unsuccessful secession attempt, a new Van Nuys municipal building was built in 2003; the Metro Orange Line opened in October 2005; and 35 new public schools had opened up by 2012.

The NoHo Arts District was established and the name chosen as a reference for its location in North Hollywood and as a play off New York City&#x27;s arts-centered SoHo District. According to the &quot;San Fernando Guide&quot;, the change helped develop a &quot;primarily lower to middle-class suburb into … a collection of art and a home for the artists who ply their trade in the galleries, theaters and dance studios in this small annex.&quot;

According to the Lake Balboa Neighborhood Council, from 2002 through November 2007 there was a debate about the official recognition of Lake Balboa as a community by the City of Los Angeles. New community names were not sanctioned by the city until January 2006, when the city adopted a formal community-naming process (City of Los Angeles Council File Number 02 -0196). On November 2, 2007, the City Council of Los Angeles approved a motion renaming a larger portion of Van Nuys to Lake Balboa.

By 2017, numerous urban development projects began in the valley, mainly in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of North Hollywood, Panorama City, and Woodland Hills. These projects started with the first few in Woodland Hills and the NoHo West project in North Hollywood began groundbreaking and construction on April 6, 2017.

LA Metro is planning to upgrade the Metro G Line by 2024 with at-grade crossing gates and two bridges crossing both Sepulveda and Van Nuys boulevards, and a full-scale light rail conversion is planned to be completed by 2050. The valley will get its first light rail line in seven decades by 2027, the East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project. Construction of the line is planned to begin in 2024 along Van Nuys Boulevard and San Fernando Road.

==Economy==

The Valley is home to numerous companies, the most well known of which work in motion pictures, music recording, and television production. The former movie ranches were branches of original studios now consisting of CBS Studio Center, NBCUniversal, The Walt Disney Company (and its ABC television network), and Warner Bros.

The valley was previously known for advances in aerospace technology and nuclear research by companies such as Lockheed, Rocketdyne and its Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Atomics International, Litton Industries, Marquardt, and TRW&#x27;s predecessor Thompson Ramo Wooldridge.

===Pornography industry ===
The valley became the pioneering region for producing adult films in the 1970s and grew to become home to a multibillion-dollar pornography industry, earning the monikers Porn Valley, Silicone Valley (in contrast to Silicon Valley, nickname for the Santa Clara Valley), and San Pornando Valley. The leading trade paper for the industry, &quot;AVN&quot; magazine, is based in the Northwest Valley, as were a majority of U.S. adult video and magazine distributors. The Paul Thomas Anderson film, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; explores these aspects of the valley. According to the HBO series &quot;Pornucopia&quot;, at one time, nearly 90 percent of all legally distributed pornographic films made in the United States were either filmed in or produced by studios based in the San Fernando Valley. The pornography industry began to decline by the mid-2000s, owing, for the most part, to the growing amount of free content on the Internet, which undercut consumers&#x27; willingness to pay. In 2007 industry insiders estimated that revenue for most adult production and distribution companies had declined 30 percent to 50 percent and the number of new films made had fallen sharply. A 2019 article stated that &quot;the porn industry in Budapest is as big as what remains of the industry in California&quot;.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Freeways====
Major freeways cross the Valley, including Interstate 405 (San Diego Freeway), U.S. Route 101 (Ventura Freeway/Hollywood Freeway), State Route 118 (Ronald Reagan Freeway), State Route 170 (Hollywood Freeway), Interstate 210 (Foothill Freeway), and Interstate 5 (Golden State Freeway). Notable streets include Sepulveda Boulevard, Ventura Boulevard, Laurel Canyon Boulevard, San Fernando Road, Victory Boulevard, Reseda Boulevard, Riverside Drive, Mulholland Drive, and State Route 27 (Topanga Canyon Boulevard).

====Rapid transit====
Subway, dedicated transitway, and express and local buses, provided by many agencies, serve the San Fernando Valley. Some of the former rights-of-way of the Pacific Electric Railway, which first accelerated population growth in the Valley, have been repurposed for busways and light rail lines.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates two Metro B Line subway stations in the Valley, which are located at Universal City and North Hollywood, which connect it directly to Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. The Metro B Line is the first heavy rail subway in the valley, extended from its prior terminus in 2000. With transfers, it connects the Valley to the entire Metro regional light rail and subway network. The B Line&#x27;s two Valley subway stations provide access to national travel through Bob Hope Airport and Amtrak and regional travel through Metrolink, Metro Rapid, Metro Local, and the Metro G Line. Metro approved a new light rail line, the East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project that will run north–south on Van Nuys Boulevard from the G Line Van Nuys station to the Sylmar/San Fernando Metrolink station, however will be built in two phases. The first between Van Nuys and Pacoima, and the second from Pacoima to Sylmar/San Fernando station. Pre construction began in 2022, and is expected to be completed between 2028 and 2030.

The G Line busway uses a dedicated transitway route running the east–west length of the Valley connecting the North Hollywood B Line Station through the valley, then heads north through Canoga Park to the Chatsworth Metrolink station.

An additional Metro Busway line is planned for the Valley operating from North Hollywood station: the North Hollywood to Pasadena Transit Corridor which will run to Pasadena with connections to the A Line. Metro is also studying a route through the Sepulveda Pass, the Sepulveda Transit Corridor, including heavy rail and monorail alternatives.

====Rail and air====
Metrolink commuter rail has two Valley lines, the Antelope Valley Line and Ventura County Line, which connect the Valley and beyond to downtown Los Angeles and south, becoming one line at the Downtown Burbank station. Metrolink always had one Burbank Airport station on the Ventura County Line, but a second Burbank Airport station was built in 2017 on the Antelope Valley Line.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; long-distance rail line has stops at Burbank Airport station, Van Nuys, and Chatsworth Station, before proceeding on to Ventura County, Santa Barbara, and Northern California or Union Station and San Diego.

The California High-Speed Rail Authority was planning two stations in the Valley, one in Burbank and the other in Sylmar, but the proposed Sylmar high-speed rail station was canceled owing to local opposition from the city of San Fernando. As of now, there&#x27;s only one planned station in the valley, located in Burbank with an initial section of the railroad possibly opening in 2029.

The Valley&#x27;s two major airports are Hollywood Burbank Airport and the Van Nuys Airport. The Van Nuys–Airport FlyAway Terminal provides nonstop scheduled shuttle service to LAX and back to the valley, with parking.

===Utilities===
Most of the utilities in the valley are served by public municipal governments, primarily the cities of Los Angeles, and Burbank, while there are only two private-owned utilities for gas and electricity in the valley as well. Southern California Edison has their overhead power lines going through the city of Burbank and through the Los Angeles city neighborhoods of Sylmar, Mission Hills, Arleta, North Hollywood, Studio City, Woodland Hills, Granada Hills, Porter Ranch, and Chatsworth as well. Internet, cable television, and cellular phone service in the valley are by large private companies.

The valley is served by the following utility companies:

* Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (serves the entire Los Angeles city section of the valley, which is two thirds of the land area, and is also the largest electric utility in the San Fernando Valley)
* Burbank Water and Power
* Southern California Edison (serves the cities of San Fernando, Calabasas, and Hidden Hills)

Natural gas

* Southern California Gas Company

Water

* Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (serves the entire Los Angeles city section of the valley, which is two thirds of the land area)

===Healthcare===

There are two Kaiser Permanente hospitals serving the San Fernando Valley, one in Panorama City and one in Woodland Hills. Also, there are three Providence hospitals, in Burbank, Providence Tarzana Medical Center in Tarzana, and Mission Hills. Besides Kaiser Permanente and Providence hospitals, most of the valley is served by non-profit hospitals such as: Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, Northridge Hospital Medical Center in Northridge, Olive View – UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar, Encino Hospital Medical Center in Encino, and Sherman Oaks Hospital in Sherman Oaks.

=== Municipal services ===
The Los Angeles satellite administrative center for the valley, The Civic Center Van Nuys, is in Van Nuys. The area in and around the Van Nuys branch of Los Angeles City Hall is home to a police station, limited and unlimited jurisdiction superior courts and Los Angeles city and county administrative offices.

Branches of the Los Angeles Public Library and independent city&#x27;s libraries service the residents.

===Emergency services===

Los Angeles Police Department; Los Angeles Fire Department; Burbank Police Department; Burbank Fire Department; and the San Fernando Police Department are independent city emergency departments in the valley. Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department only serves unincorporated Universal City; the cities of Calabasas, Agoura Hills, &amp; Hidden Hills; and also serves the three Los Angeles Community College District campuses in the San Fernando valley. The California State University system also has its own police force within the California State University, Northridge campus. Los Angeles County Fire Department only serves unincorporated areas, including Universal City; and the cities of Calabasas &amp; Hidden Hills.

==Demographics==
As of 2023 the population of the San Fernando Valley was 1,815,801, of which 42 percent were Hispanic or Latino, 39 percent were non-Hispanic white, 11 percent were Asian, 4 percent were African Americans, 4 percent were two or more races and 1 percent other. The largest city located entirely in the valley is Burbank, with over 107,000 residents. The most populous districts of Los Angeles in the Valley are Van Nuys and Pacoima, which like the city of Burbank have more than 100,000 residents each. Despite the San Fernando Valley&#x27;s reputation for sprawling, low-density development, the valley communities of Panorama City, North Hollywood, Van Nuys, Reseda, Canoga Park, and Northridge, all in Los Angeles, have numerous apartment complexes and contain some of the densest census tracts in Los Angeles.

The San Fernando Valley has a significant population below the poverty level. About 30 percent of Valley households in 2009 earned less than $35,000 a year, including 10 percent who made less than $15,000 a year.
The Pacoima district, once considered the hub of suburban blight and of having the highest poverty rate, is no longer such. Other San Fernando Valley neighborhoods such as North Hollywood, Panorama City, and Arleta now have poverty rates which are higher.
In general, the areas with lower poverty rates have become fewer and more scattered, while many of the now affluent communities have become compartmented, having their own private, planned and gated communities. Many of these tend to be on or near the borders of the Valley in the foothill regions.

According to Mapping L.A., Mexican and Salvadoran were the most common ancestries in San Fernando Valley in 2000. Mexico and El Salvador were the most common foreign places of birth.

<doc id="324332" wikidata="Q323301" url="?curid=324332" title="Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch">
<text>The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch (), also known as the Antiochian Orthodox Church and legally as the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch|Rūm]] Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East (), is an autocephalous Greek Orthodox church within the wider communion of Eastern Orthodox Christianity that originates from the historical Church of Antioch. Headed by the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Antioch, it considers itself the successor to the Christian community founded in Antioch by the Apostles Peter and Paul. It is one of the largest Christian denominations of the Middle East, alongside the Copts of Egypt and the Maronites of Lebanon.

Its adherents, known as Antiochian Christians, are a Middle-Eastern semi-ethnoreligious Eastern Christian group residing in the Levant region including the Hatay Province of Turkey. Many of their descendants now live in the global Eastern Christian diaspora. The number of Antiochian Greek Christians is estimated to be approximately 4.3 million.

==Background==

The seat of the patriarchate was formerly Antioch, in what is now Turkey. The Church of Cassian was the cathedral church of Antioch to the Melkite and Latin patriarch during late antiquity and the Middle Ages. However, in the 14th century, it was moved to Damascus, modern-day Syria. Its traditional territory includes Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, and also parts of Turkey. Its territory formerly included the Church of Cyprus until the latter became autocephalous in 431. Both the Orthodox Churches of Antioch and Cyprus are members of the Middle East Council of Churches.

Its North American branch is autonomous, although the Holy Synod of Antioch still appoints its head bishop, chosen from a list of three candidates nominated in the North American archdiocese. Its Australasia and Oceania branch is the largest in terms of geographic area due to the relatively large size of Australia and the large portion of the Pacific Ocean that the archdiocese covers.

The head of the Orthodox Church of Antioch is called Patriarch. The present Greek Orthodox patriarch of Antioch is John X (Yazigi), who presided over the Archdiocese of Western and Central Europe (2008–2013). He was elected as primate of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East as John X of Antioch (Yazigi) on December 17, 2012. He succeeded Ignatius IV who had died on December 5, 2012. Membership statistics are not available, but may be as high as 1,100,000 in Syria and 400,000 in Lebanon where they make up 8% of the population or 20% of Christians who make up 39–41% of Lebanon. The seat of the patriarch in Damascus is the Mariamite Cathedral of Damascus.

The Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch is one of several churches that lay claim to be the canonical incumbent of the ancient see of Antioch. The Syriac Orthodox Church makes the same claim, as do the Syriac Catholic Church, the Maronite Church, and the Melkite Greek Catholic Church; the latter three are Eastern Catholic Churches in full communion with the Holy See and mutually recognize each other as holding authentic patriarchates, being part of the same Catholic communion. Their fellow Catholic particular church, the Latin Church, also appointed titular patriarchs for many centuries, until the office was left vacant in 1953 and abolished in 1964 with all claims renounced.

==History and cultural legacy==

===Pauline Greco-Semitic roots===
According to Luke the Evangelist- himself a Greco-Syrian member of that community:
St Peter and St Paul the Apostle are considered the cofounders of the Patriarchate of Antioch, the former being its first bishop. When Peter left Antioch, Evodios and Ignatius took over the charge of the Patriarchate. Both Evodios and Ignatius died as martyrs under Roman persecution.

Hellenistic Judaism and the Judeo-Greek &quot;wisdom&quot; literature popular in the late Second Temple era among both Hellenized Rabbinical Jews (known as &quot;Mityavnim&quot; in Hebrew) and gentile Greek proselyte converts to mainstream Judaism played an important part in the formation of the Melkite-Antiochian Greek Orthodox tradition. Some typically Grecian &quot;Ancient Synagogal&quot; priestly rites and hymns have survived partially to the present in the distinct church service, architecture and iconography of the Melkite Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic communities of the Hatay Province of Southern Turkey, Syria and Lebanon.

Some historians believe that a sizable proportion of the Hellenized Jewish communities and most gentile Greco-Macedonian settlers in Southern Turkey (Antioch, Alexandretta and neighboring cities) and Syria/Lebanon – the former being called &quot;Hellenistai&quot; in the Acts – converted progressively to the Greco-Roman branch of Christianity that eventually constituted the &quot;Melkite&quot; (or &quot;Imperial&quot;) Hellenistic Churches in Western Asia and North Africa:
Acts 6 points to the problematic cultural tensions between the Hellenized Jews and Greek-speaking Judeo-Christians centered around Antioch and related Cilician, Southern-Anatolian and Syrian &quot;Diasporas&quot; and (the generally more conservative) Aramaic-speaking Jewish converts to Christianity based in Jerusalem and neighboring Israeli towns:

===&quot;There is neither Jew nor Greek&quot;===
These ethno-cultural and social tensions were eventually surmounted by the emergence of a new, typically Antiochian Greek doctrine (&quot;doxa&quot;) spearheaded by Paul (himself a Hellenized Cilician Jew) and his followers be they 1. Established, autochthonous Hellenized Cilician-Western Syrian Jews (themselves descendants of Babylonian and &#x27;Asian&#x27; Jewish migrants who had adopted early on various elements of Greek culture and civilization while retaining a generally conservative attachment to Jewish laws &amp; traditions), 2. Heathen, &#x27;Classical&#x27; Greeks, Greco-Macedonian and Greco-Syrian gentiles, and 3. the local, autochthonous descendants of Greek or Greco-Syrian converts to mainstream Judaism – known as &quot;Proselytes&quot; (Greek: προσήλυτος/proselytes or &#x27;newcomers to Israel&#x27;) and Greek-speaking Jews born of mixed marriages.

Paul&#x27;s efforts were probably facilitated by the arrival of a fourth wave of Greek-speaking newcomers to Cilicia, Northwestern Syria, Galilee and Jerusalem: Cypriot and &#x27;Cyrenian&#x27; (Libyan) Jewish migrants of non-Egyptian North African Jewish origin and gentile Roman settlers from Italy — many of whom already spoke fluent Koine Greek and/or sent their children to Greco-Syrian schools. Some scholars believe that, at the time, these Cypriot and Cyrenian North African Jewish migrants were generally less affluent than the autochthonous Cilician-Syrian Jews and practiced a more &#x27;liberal&#x27; form of Judaism, more propitious for the formation of a new canon:
These subtle, progressive socio-cultural shifts are somehow summarized succinctly in Chapter 3 of the Epistle to the Galatians:
===Dual self-designation: &quot;Melkites&quot; and &quot;Eastern Romans&quot;===
The unique combination of ethnocultural traits inhered from the fusion of a Greek cultural base, Hellenistic Judaism and Roman civilization gave birth to the distinctly Antiochian &quot;Eastern Mediterranean-Roman&quot; Christian traditions of Cilicia (Southeastern Turkey) and Syria/Lebanon:
Some of the typically Antiochian ancient liturgical traditions of the community rooted in Hellenistic Judaism and, more generally, Second Temple Greco-Jewish Septuagint culture, were expunged progressively in the late medieval and modern eras by both Phanariot European-Greek (Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople) and Vatican (Roman Catholic) theologians who sought to &#x27;bring back&#x27; Levantine Greek Orthodox and Greek-Catholic communities into the European Christian fold.

But members of the community in Southern Turkey, Syria and Lebanon still call themselves Rūm (روم) which means &quot;Eastern Romans&quot; or &quot;Asian Greeks&quot; in Arabic. In that particular context, the term &quot;Rūm&quot; is used in preference to &quot;Yūnāniyyūn&quot; (يونانيون) which means &quot;European Greeks&quot; or &quot;Ionians&quot; in Biblical Hebrew (borrowed from Old Persian &quot;Yavan&quot; = Greece) and Classical Arabic. Members of the community also call themselves &#x27;Melkites&#x27;, which literally means &quot;monarchists&quot; or &quot;supporters of the emperor&quot; in Semitic languages – a reference to their past allegiance to Greco-Macedonian, Roman and Byzantine imperial rule. But, in the modern era, the term tends to be more commonly used by followers of the Greek Catholic Church of Antioch and Alexandria and Jerusalem.

===Interaction with other non-Muslim ethnocultural minorities===
Following the fall of the Turkish Ottoman Empire and the Tsarist Russian Empire (long the protector of Greek-Orthodox minorities in the Levant), and the ensuing rise of French colonialism, communism, Islamism and Israeli nationalism, some members of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch embraced secularism and/or Arab Nationalism as a way to modernize and &quot;secularize&quot; the newly formed nation-states of Northern Syria and Lebanon, and thus provide a viable &quot;alternative&quot; to political Islam, communism and Jewish nationalism (viewed as ideologies potentially exclusive of Byzantine Christian minorities).

This often led to interfaith conflicts with the Maronite Church in Lebanon, notably regarding Palestinian refugees after 1948 and 1967. Various (sometimes secular) intellectuals with a Greek Orthodox Antiochian background played an important role in the development of Baathism, the most prominent being Michel Aflaq, one of the founders of the movement.

===Abraham Dimitri Rihbany===
In the early 20th century (notably during World War I), Lebanese-American writers of Greek-Orthodox Antiochian background such as Abraham Dimitri Rihbany, known as Abraham Mitrie Rihbany (a convert to Presbyterianism), popularized the notion of studying ancient Greco-Semitic culture to better understand the historic and ethnocultural context of the Christian Gospels: his original views were developed in a series of articles for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and in 1916 published in book form as &quot;The Syrian Christ&quot;.

At a time when most of the Arab world area was ruled by the Ottoman Empire, France and Britain, Rihbany called for US military intervention in the Holy Land to fend off Ottoman Pan-Islamism, French colonialism, Soviet Communism and radical Zionist enterprises- all viewed as potentially detrimental to Christian minorities.

==Administration and structure==
The administration and structure of the Antiochian See are governed by statutes.

===The Patriarch===

The Patriarch is elected by the Holy Synod from among the metropolitans who compose it. The Patriarch presides the Holy Synod and executes its decisions. He also acts as metropolitan of the Archdiocese of Antioch and Damascus.

The current Patriarch, John X (Yazigi), was elected on December 17, 2012, succeeding to Metropolitan Saba Esber, who had been elected &quot;locum tenens&quot; on December 7, 2012, following Ignatius IV (Hazim)&#x27;s death.

<doc id="324336" wikidata="Q766381" url="?curid=324336" title="Dulce et Decorum est">
<text>&quot;Dulce et Decorum Est&quot; is a poem written by Wilfred Owen during World War I, and published posthumously in 1920. Its Latin title is from a verse written by the Roman poet Horace: &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot;. In English, this means &quot;it is sweet and right to die for one&#x27;s country&quot;. The poem is one of Owen&#x27;s most renowned works; it is known for its horrific imagery and its condemnation of war. It was drafted at Craiglockhart in the first half of October 1917 and later revised, probably at Scarborough, but possibly at Ripon, between January and March 1918. The earliest known manuscript is dated 8 October 1917 and is addressed to the poet&#x27;s mother, Susan Owen, with the note &quot;Here is a gas poem done yesterday (which is not private, but not final).&quot;

==Summary==
The text presents a vignette from the front lines of World War I: A group of British soldiers on the march are attacked with chlorine gas. Poison-gas artillery shells explode, and one soldier takes too long to put on his gas mask. The speaker of the poem describes the gruesome effects of the gas on the man, and concludes that anyone who sees the reality of war at first hand would not repeat mendacious platitudes such as &quot;dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot;: &quot;How sweet and honourable it is to die for one&#x27;s country&quot;. Owen himself was a soldier who served on the front line during World War I, and his poem is a statement about a type of war atrocity that the poet had personally experienced.

==Dedication==
Throughout the poem, and particularly strong in the last stanza, there is a running commentary, a letter to Jessie Pope, a civilian propagandist of World War I, who encouraged—&quot;with such high zest&quot;—young men to join the battle, through her poetry, e.g. &quot;Who&#x27;s for the game?&quot;

The first draft of the poem, indeed, was dedicated to Pope. A later revision amended this to &quot;a certain Poetess&quot;, though this did not make it into the final publication, either, as Owen apparently decided to address his poem to the larger audience of war supporters in general such as the women who handed out white feathers during the conflict to men whom they regarded as cowards for not being at the front. In the last stanza, however, the original intention can still be seen in Owen&#x27;s address.

==Title==
The title of this poem means &quot;It is sweet and fitting&quot;. The title and the Latin exhortation of the final two lines are drawn from the phrase &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot; written by the Roman poet Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus):
These words were well known and often quoted by supporters of the war near its inception and were, therefore, of particular relevance to soldiers of the era. In 1913, the line &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot; was inscribed on the wall of the chapel of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In the final stanza of his poem, Owen refers to this as &quot;The old Lie&quot;.

Some uncertainty arises around how to pronounce the Latin phrase when the poem is read aloud. There are essentially three choices:

1. The traditional English pronunciation of Latin, current until the early twentieth century (“dull-see et decorum est, pro pay-tria mor-eye”).

2. The Italianate or Ecclesiastical Latin pronunciation, used in Owen’s day in both the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, and in continued use today in the Catholic Church (“dool-chay et decorum est, pro patria mor-ee”).

3. The Classical Latin pronunciation reconstructed by scholars in the nineteenth century and generally taught in schools since the early 1900s (“dool-kay et decorum est, pro patria mor-ee”).

Owen’s own schooling took place at a time when the teaching of Latin pronunciation was in transition and therefore – without knowing how he himself would have pronounced the phrase – any of the three versions can be considered acceptable. Based on the rhyme scheme, the first version is the least likely.

==Structure==
The style of &quot;Dulce et Decorum Est&quot; is similar to the French ballade poetic form. By referencing this formal poetic form and then breaking the conventions of pattern and rhyming, Owen accentuates the disruptive and chaotic events being told. Each of the stanzas has a traditional rhyming scheme, using two quatrains of rhymed iambic pentameter with several spondaic substitutions. These make the poem&#x27;s reading experience seem close to a casual talking speed and clarity.

The poem is in two parts, each of 14 lines. The first part of the poem (the first 8 line and the second 6 line stanzas) is written in the present as the action happens and everyone is reacting to the events around them. In the second part (the third 2 line and the last 12 line stanzas), the narrator writes as though at a distance from the horror: he refers to what is happening twice as if in a &quot;dream&quot;, as though standing back watching the events or even recalling them. Another interpretation is to read the lines literally. &quot;In all my dreams&quot; may mean this sufferer of shell shock is haunted by a friend drowning in his own blood, and cannot sleep without revisiting the horror nightly. The second part looks back to draw a lesson from what happened at the start. The two 14 line parts of the poem echo a formal poetic style, the sonnet, but a broken and unsettling version of this form. This poem is considered by many as one of the best war poems ever written.

Studying the two parts of the poem reveals a change in the use of language from visual impressions outside the body, to sounds produced by the body – or a movement from the visual to the visceral. In the opening lines, the scene is set with visual phrases such as &quot;haunting flares&quot;, but after the gas attack the poem has sounds produced by the victim – &quot;guttering&quot;, &quot;choking&quot;, &quot;gargling&quot;. In this way, Owen evokes the terrible effects of chlorine gas corroding the body from inside.

==Composition==

In May 1917 Owen was diagnosed with neurasthenia (shell-shock) and sent to Craiglockhart hospital near Edinburgh to recover. Whilst receiving treatment at the hospital, Owen became the editor of the hospital magazine, &quot;The Hydra&quot;, and met the poet Siegfried Sassoon, who was to have a major impact upon his life and work and to play a crucial role in the dissemination of Owen’s poetry following his untimely death in 1918, aged 25. Owen wrote a number of his most famous poems at Craiglockhart, including several drafts of &quot;Dulce et Decorum Est&quot;, &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot;. Sassoon advised and encouraged Owen, and this is evident in a number of drafts which include Sassoon’s annotations.

Only five of Owen&#x27;s poems were published in his lifetime. However, after his death, his heavily-worked manuscript drafts were brought together and published in two different editions by Siegfried Sassoon with the assistance of Edith Sitwell (in 1920) and Edmund Blunden (in 1931).

<text>The Church of Antioch (, ; ) was the first of the five major churches of what later became the pentarchy in Christianity, with its primary seat in the ancient Greek city of Antioch (present-day Antakya, Turkey).

The earliest record of the church of Antioch is given in Acts 11, stating that some &quot;men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus [...] and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.&quot; Later, at the start of their missionary journeys, Paul the Apostle (also called Saul) and Barnabas preached in Antioch for a year, and followers of the church were called &quot;Christians&quot; for the first time.

==History==
Followers of Jesus as the messiah trace the origin of the term &quot;Christian&quot; to the church established at Antioch. The first church was founded by Jesus Christ, before Pentecost on a mountain top with the disciples while Christ was still alive. 

According to verses 19–26 of Acts 11, Barnabas went to Tarsus in search of Saul and brought him to Antioch. They met with the church and taught for a year. The disciples, who had been scattered because of persecution in Jerusalem, were first called &quot;Christians&quot; in Antioch. One of the leading members of this group was Barnabas, who was sent to organize the new church. The group later became the Patriarchate of Antioch, part of the pentarchy as one of the five great patriarchates.

Saul, also known as Paul the Apostle, began his missionary journeys in Antioch. According to Acts, Judaizers from Jerusalem caused a disturbance in the church. Paul started his first missionary journey from Antioch and returned there. After the Jerusalem decree to the gentile converts in Antioch, Paul began his second missionary journey from Antioch. His third journey also began there. Ignatius then served as bishop there for forty years until his martyrdom in 107 AD.

Antioch served as a central point for sending missionaries to the gentiles, probably after the Great Commission. Nicolas, one of the Seven Deacons, was a missionary from Antioch.

Antioch was also the birthplace of John Chrysostom, a prominent Christian father who died in 407AD.

The seat of the Patriarchate was originally in Antioch (in present-day Turkey). In response to the Ottoman invasion in the 15th century, it was moved to Damascus.

Some ancient synagogue priestly rites and hymns of Greek origin have partially survived to the modern day, particularly in the unique worship of the Melkite and Greek Orthodox communities in the Turkish Hatay province, Syria, Lebanon and northern Israel. Members of these communities still refer to themselves as &quot;Rūm&quot;, which literally means &quot;Eastern Romans&quot; or &quot;Byzantines&quot; in Turkish, Persian and Arabic. The term &quot;Rūm&quot; is preferred to &quot;Yūnāniyyūn&quot;, which means &quot;Greek&quot; or &quot;Ionian&quot;.

==Successive branches==
===Oriental Orthodox===
*Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East

===Eastern Orthodox===
*Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East

===Catholic===
The Maronite, Melkite, and Syriac Catholic patriarchates are in full communion with the Catholic Church and thus recognise each other&#x27;s claims. The Catholic Church also appointed a Latin Patriarch of Antioch in 1100 by way of Bohemond (founder of the Principality of Antioch, one of the crusader states). After the Crusades, this office became titular in 1268, and lasted as titular for many centuries until it was abolished in 1964.

The Maronite Patriarchate of Antioch and all the East was founded by Maron in the 5th century; it survived the later Muslim invasions, reaffirming communion with Rome in the 12th century. The Melkite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch and of All the East, of Alexandria and of Jerusalem was formed in 1724 by Cyril VI Tanas, who brought a group of the Greek Orthodox community of Antioch into communion with Rome. The Syriac Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch was first formed in 1662 with the election of the Catholic-aligned Andrew Akijan as Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, and later re-established in 1782 with the election of the Catholic Michael III Jarweh as the same.

<text>Anita Blake is the title and viewpoint character of the &quot;Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter&quot; series by Laurell K. Hamilton. The series takes place in a parallel world in which supernatural characters like vampires and werewolves exist alongside regular humans, with Blake&#x27;s jobs including the re-animation of the dead as well as the hunting and executing of supernatural creatures (mostly vampires) that have broken the law. Hamilton stated that she created the character after perceiving a gender inequality in detective fiction, with female characters rarely getting the same treatment as male heroes of the genre.

==Description==
Anita Blake is a petite woman of mixed German and Mexican heritage with curly long raven hair and pale skin with scars scattered over her body. She is very direct and flippant in her speech, but is said to be highly competent in the professions she is involved in. At the start of the series, she is an animator (a person who raises zombies) and a vampire executioner. She is trained in several forms of hand-to-hand combat as well as in the use of several firearms, with her firearm of preference being the Browning BDM. Blake practices Christianity and is currently of the Episcopal faith, having left Catholicism since the Catholic Church has excommunicated all animators. In the short story &quot;Dancing&quot; she describes herself as being 5&#x27;3 inches tall, as well as in &quot;Laughing Corpse&quot;, Ch. 1.

Blake is known to be carrying between four and five strains of the lycanthropy virus. As of &quot;Affliction,&quot; Anita carries wolf, leopard, lion, hyena, as well as several different colors of tiger. This is considered to be unusual in the &quot;Vampire Hunter&quot; universe, with very few other characters possessing more than one form of lycanthropy.

=== Knowledge and abilities ===
*Necromancer: Anita is one of the most powerful living animators in St. Louis at the beginning of the series, with her powers eventually making her one of the strongest animators in history. Her level of ability has been shown to exert power over both vampires and the undead, with her being capable of raising lifelike zombies.
* Combat Training: Anita has a black belt in Judo as of the first book. In &quot;Obsidian Butterfly&quot; she is also studying Kenpo Karate. Later (&quot;Affliction&quot;) she started MMA training. She works out regularly, first with her best friend Ronnie &quot;to be able to outrun the bad guys&quot; when she needs to, then with Circus of the Damned guards. She credits Edward (Federal Marshall Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Forrester, The Death) for much of her training in weapons, primarily handguns and knives. She is primarily right-handed, but she can fight with her left hand.
* Detective Training: Though she rarely uses these skills in later novels, Anita has been involved with many investigations with RPIT and in the later books with the FBI. Her police contact, Rudolph Storr, routinely requires her to engage in independent crime scene reconstruction in order to obtain an analysis—Anita&#x27;s reconstructions are almost always correct and frequently include insights that the police have missed. Anita thinks like both a cop and a monster, according to some, which is what makes her so insightful.
* Supernatural Experience: Anita holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in preternatural biology and is a trained Vampire executioner. She is able to resist the mental influence of Jean-Claude&#x27;s, a vampire who is also her love interest. In the later books Anita has given Damian, her Vampire servant, the fourth mark. This does not interfere with Jean Claude&#x27;s marks. It is uncertain if this unconventional fourth mark grants Anita immortality.
* Triumvirate Member: Anita is a member of a &quot;triumvirate&quot; with Jean-Claude and her additional love interest Richard Zeeman (&quot;The Killing Dance&quot;). At first the only effect is their powers boosting when they are together, even more so when touching. (The usefulness of the triumvirate varies with the interpersonal conflicts between Richard, Jean-Claude and Anita.) In later novels she creates a secondary triumvirate with Nathaniel as her wereleopard to call and Damian as her vampire servant.
* Vampire Powers: The combination of her necromancy and her membership in the triumvirate has caused Anita to develop a series of powers formerly seen only in Vampires, which includes the &quot;ardeur&quot;, a sexual power that allows her to feed from other supernatural creatures and humans.
* Vampire Marks: In the Anita Blake world Master Vampires can create a mystic link with a human or with an animal to call. The creation of such a link is a four-step process; steps are called marks and it is understood that a Master Vampire &quot;gives&quot; the marks to subjugate a human or wereanimal. A human which received all four marks is a Human Servant to Master Vampire; a wereanimal (or siren, or ghost, or selkie, etc.) which received all four marks is The Animal to Call (as opposed to an animal to call). Each mark gives both sides of the marking process new abilities. Without any mental precautions a pair Master Vampire - Human Servant may become one personality in two bodies (&quot;Kiss the Dead&quot;, Chapter 45). Anita Blake received unknowingly the first two marks from Jean-Claude in &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, then the third mark in &quot;Circus of the Damned&quot;; then Master Vampire Alejandro took her over with all four marks, which made her capable to kill Alejandro with her bare hands, thus wiping all marks. In &quot;Killing Dance&quot; Anita Blake accepted voluntarily the first three marks from Jean-Claude to save his life and Richard Zeeman&#x27;s life. In &quot;Incubus Dreams&quot;, Chapter 13 Anita Blake, acting as Master Vampire, accidentally gave all four marks to both Damian and Nathaniel Graison, thus forming her own Triumvirate of Power.
*Power Mimicry: &quot;It was almost as if the more often I was used by, or borrowed magic from, someone else, the more likely it became that their magic would become part of my arsenal.&quot; Anita discussing this ability in Chapter 47 of Danse Macabre.

== Character biography ==

===Early years===
Anita Blake was born with the power of necromancy, a power that she inherited from her grandmother. Her mother died in a car accident when Anita was 8, which greatly impacted her throughout her childhood and adult years. When Anita was 10, her father remarried after her mother&#x27;s death to Judith, whom Anita often clashed with over her powers and differences. Anita could &#x27;see&#x27; ghosts, and raised her dead pet dog and even road kill, to her, her father and step-mothers dismay. Anita initially exerted little control over her powers, eventually leading her father to request that her maternal grandmother teach Anita how to &quot;turn off&quot; her abilities. Her Maternal Grandmother taught her how to control her abilities, but seeing how powerful Anita was, encouraged Anita&#x27;s dad to raise her as a Christian instead of vaudun. During college she raised a professor who had killed himself-her roommate moved out the next day. Anita majored in preternatural biology and became engaged to a fellow student, who later broke off the engagement due to his parents disapproving of him dating a Mexican woman. He was her first sexual experience. This would cause Anita to remain celibate for much of the initial books in the series (until &quot;The Killing Dance&quot;). After graduation Anita was recruited by Bert Vaughn to join Animators, Inc. as a professional zombie animator, where she was trained by Manny Rodriguez and became a licensed vampire executioner. She also met Edward, and learned about weapons. During the events in &quot;First Death&quot; she met the vampire hunter Edward and received several of her scars, which includes a cross-shaped brand on her arm.

===Books 1–5===
In the first novel (&quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;) Anita receives her first marks from the vampire Jean-Claude and begins to gain advanced healing powers and abilities. By the end of the book she has become instrumental in removing the previous Master Vampire of the City Nikolaos from power by killing her and has received two of the four marks necessary to become Jean-Claude&#x27;s Human Servant. These marks also enhance her necromancy powers, with Jean-Claude remarking in &quot;The Laughing Corpse&quot; that he could feel her power calling to him at the end of the book. In the third novel (&quot;Circus of the Damned&quot;) Anita meets high school science teacher and closet werewolf Richard Zeeman and begins dating him. She is also attacked by rival vampire Alejandro, who too marks her as his Human Servant, which cancels out the control that Jean-Claude previously exerted through the marks he had given her.

In (&quot;The Lunatic Cafe&quot;) Anita becomes engaged to Richard, only to have Jean-Claude quickly blackmail her into dating him after learning of the engagement. Anita also meets Raina, the lupa of the local wolf pack, as well as Jason, a young werewolf. Anita&#x27;s powers grow in (&quot;Bloody Bones&quot;), as does her relationship with Jean-Claude.

===Books 6–10===
In (&quot;The Killing Dance&quot;) Richard has become the Ulfric, or leader, of his pack after killing off the previous leader Marcus. Anita herself kills Raina, who later inhabits Anita&#x27;s body, both antagonizing her as well as giving her the ability to heal others. It is during this book that Anita forms a triumvirate with Richard and Jean-Claude as well as accepting further vampire marks from him. This makes it impossible for Anita to separate herself from Richard or Jean-Claude, which is further exacerbated when Anita breaks her engagement with Richard and becomes Jean-Claude&#x27;s lover after watching Richard eat Marcus and transform into his wolf form. Despite this, Anita&#x27;s magical bonds with the two are further strengthened throughout the series and Anita is still considered to be the &quot;lupa&quot; or female leader of the pack despite her relationship issues with Richard. Anita becomes the protector of the local were-leopard pack in (&quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;), a role that places her alongside the were-leopard Nathaniel, who has expressed a sexual interest in Anita.

Her relationship with Richard is somewhat reconciled in (&quot;Blue Moon&quot;) when she travels to Tennessee to clear him of rape charges. Her powers continue expanding, as Damian begins showing signs of being Anita&#x27;s vampire servant. During this book she also begins learning magic through the Wiccan Marianne in an attempt to help teach Anita how to close off her metaphysical ties to Richard and Jean-Claude in an attempt to keep from being overwhelmed by them. This proves to be detrimental to Richard and Jean-Claude in (&quot;Obsidian Butterfly&quot;), where she learns from a powerful vampire in New Mexico that it weakens all three of them. It is also during this novel that Anita is introduced to the serial killer Olaf, who becomes infatuated with Anita becoming his &quot;serial killer sweetie&quot;, partially because she fits what he looks for in a victim. In (&quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot;) the damage done to her friends and allies from the closing off of the marks is further shown, with Damian having become a feral killing machine in her absence, confirming that he is her vampire servant. During this book Anita also contracts several strains of lycanthropy after being injured by a wereleopard and Chimera, the split personality of Orlando King, a lycanthrope hunter. Anita also becomes sexually involved with the were-leopard Micah, who becomes her Nimir-Raj and mate by the end of the book. It is during &quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot; that Anita develops the &quot;ardeur&quot; through Jean-Claude, a rare sexual power that allows Anita to draw power through lust but also initially requires that she has sex multiple times a day to keep it under control. This power causes the official end of Anita&#x27;s relationship with Richard after she is forced to feed off of him, although she still serves as the lupa and punisher of the St. Louis wolf pack. At the end of the novel, Anita has yet to physically shift into any one form of lycanthrope. She has started a complex romantic and sexual relationship with Jean-Claude, Micah and Nathaniel, who she has begun to use as a source of food for the &quot;ardeur&quot;.

=== Books 11–15 ===
Anita takes on further lovers through the next few books, partially due to the needs of the ardeur as well as to extend protection from other vampire Masters, as seen in (&quot;Cerulean Sins&quot;) where she takes Asher as a lover in order to outmaneuver Belle Morte. Her closeness with the supernatural world causes issues with her job as a U.S. Marshall, with Lt. Rudolph &quot;Dolph&quot; Storr expressing extreme disapproval of her romantic and sexual choices and attempting to have one of her lovers, Jason, imprisoned for being a shapeshifter. In (&quot;Incubus Dreams&quot;) she begins to exhibit control over the ardeur but accidentally forms a triumvirate with Damian and Nathaniel. During this time Anita shows reluctance to let her sexual partners have other lovers, which she eventually eases up on through the course of the series. The formation of the second triumvirate allows Anita&#x27;s powers to develop to where she has the ability to raise an entire cemetery without the use of human sacrifice.

Anita has a pregnancy scare in (&quot;Danse Macabre&quot;), as the &quot;ardeur&#x27;s&quot; control over her made it difficult to consistently use birth control during each feeding. She also discovers that her &quot;ardeur&quot; is seeking out people powerful enough to be &quot;food&quot; and has the potential to shape personalities to be more compatible relationship-wise. Anita gains the ability to pass the need to shape-shift onto others, although she can only pass the need on to others of the same strain of lycanthropy. During the novel Anita begins to accept that she has become a succubus, with her powers resembling that of a vampire. During this time, Anita is frequently visited and harassed by Marmee Noir, the Mother of All Darkness that has been sleeping for years.

As a result of her growing powers Anita manages to overpower the extremely old and very strong vampire force named the Harlequin that was sent after her in &quot;The Harlequin&quot;, but only after having to feed off of the leaders of the various lycanthrope groups in St. Louis in order to heal the others in her group and supply them with power. It is during this time that the leader of the were-lion group, Joseph, refuses to have sex with Anita since he is married; this leads to his exile and potential death. At the end of &quot;The Harlequin&quot; it is discovered that the Harlequin were not operating on official Council orders and were planning to take over Jean-Claude&#x27;s territory.

===Books 16–21===
Marmee Noir&#x27;s attacks on Blake intensify and in &quot;Blood Noir&quot; she manages to &quot;roll&quot; Blake for two days during a visit to Asheville, North Carolina, during which Marmee Noir forces her to have sex with two were-tigers that were in the area. Blake also discovers that her anger and rage have been affecting those around her, specifically Richard. He is eventually released from that anger, gaining a power in the process and Anita learns that she can feed from feelings of anger as much as from lust and that Jason has become her wolf to call. Blake&#x27;s troubles with Marmee Noir continue in &quot;Skin Trade&quot; in which she is also attacked by the ancient vampire Vittorio, who attempts and fails to make her his Human Servant. However, under Vittorio&#x27;s influence, Blake is once again forced to have sex with several were-tigers, one of which is a sixteen-year-old boy and virgin. Blake&#x27;s &quot;ardeur&quot; powers reach a head in &quot;Flirt&quot; when she uses it in self-defense against a were-lion (Nicky) that had kidnapped her to perform a zombie raising for his client, only for Nicky to have all of his free will taken away and to become Anita&#x27;s &quot;slave&quot;. At the end of &quot;Skin Trade&quot; Marmee Noir&#x27;s body was destroyed, however in &quot;Bullet&quot; her spirit returns to attack Anita and the Vampire Council. Marmee Noir&#x27;s previous plan was to have a powerful were-tiger impregnate Anita and then to possess the unborn infant, but her plans shift to her taking over Anita&#x27;s body or kill her in the process. She&#x27;s ultimately defeated by Anita in &quot;Hit List&quot;, despite Marmee Noir having the Harlequin assist her in this task.

Blake&#x27;s ongoing relationships become even more complicated by the end of &quot;Kiss the Dead&quot;, as one of the were-tigers she had sex with in &quot;Skin Trade&quot; (Cynric) has moved to St. Louis to be with her, but is still only seventeen at the beginning of the novel. Her tentative relationship with Asher is also on hold and potentially over, as he is sent away to potentially become the Master of a different city due to him attacking her out of jealousy. This plot element is further complicated in &quot;Affliction&quot; after Jean Claude and Blake bring Asher back home because they and several others miss him as well as because Asher has been purposely alienating people in each city he visited. During the events in &quot;Affliction&quot; Blake also gains the ability to call hyenas after she was forced to shoot one of her were-hyena guards while he was being controlled by the Lover of Death, who was previously thought to be dead. Currently Blake has agreed to marry Jean Claude, Micah, and Nathaniel in a dedication ceremony, but has decided to place the ceremony on hold due to potential problems that some of her various men have with the arrangement.

<text>Ramsgate is a seaside town and civil parish in the district of Thanet in east Kent, England. It was one of the great English seaside towns of the 19th century. In 2021 it had a population of 42,027. Ramsgate&#x27;s main attraction is its coastline, and its main industries are tourism and fishing. The town has one of the largest marinas on the English south coast, and the Port of Ramsgate provided cross-channel ferries for many years.

==History==

Ramsgate began as a fishing and farming hamlet. The Christian missionary St Augustine, sent by Pope Gregory the Great, landed near Ramsgate in AD 597. The town is home to the Shrine of St Augustine.

The earliest reference to the town is in the Kent Hundred Rolls of 1274–5, both as &quot;Remmesgate&quot; (in the local personal name of &#x27;Christina de Remmesgate&#x27;) and as &quot;Remisgat&quot; (with reference to the town). The names &quot;Ramisgate&quot; and &quot;Raunsgate&quot; appear in the parish of St. Laurence records . These are all derived from late Anglo-Saxon &#x27;Hremmes&#x27; from earlier &#x27;Hræfnes&#x27; (raven&#x27;s) and &#x27;geat&#x27; (gate), with reference to the gap in the cliffs. In 1357, the area became known as &quot;Ramesgate&quot;.

Ramsgate was a member of the Confederation of Cinque Ports, under the &#x27;Limb&#x27; of Sandwich, Kent. The construction of Ramsgate Harbour began in 1749 and was completed in around 1850. The harbour has the distinction of being the only Royal Harbour in the United Kingdom. Because of its proximity to mainland Europe, Ramsgate was a chief embarkation point both during the Napoleonic Wars and for the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940.

&quot;The Official Illustrated Guide to South-Eastern and North and Mid-Kent Railways&quot; (June 1863) by George Measom from describes Ramsgate thus: &#x27;It is impossible to speak too favourably of this first-rate town, its glorious sands, its bathing, its hotels, libraries, churches, etc. etc. not forgetting its bracing climate...The streets of Ramsgate are well paved or macadamed and brilliantly lighted with gas.&#x27;

The architect A W Pugin and his sons lived in Ramsgate and built several important buildings there, including St Augustine&#x27;s Church, The Grange, St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, and The Granville Hotel.

The artist Vincent van Gogh moved to Ramsgate in April 1876, at age 23. He boarded at 11 Spencer Square, which is identified by a blue plaque. He obtained work as a teacher at a local school in Royal Road, where he received his post. In one of his letters to his brother Theo, he described his surroundings: &quot;There&#x27;s a harbour full of all kinds of ships, closed in by stone jetties running into the sea on which one can walk. And further out one sees the sea in its natural state, and that&#x27;s beautiful.&quot;

In 1901, an electric tram service, one of the few inter-urban tramways in Britain, was introduced on the Isle of Thanet. The towns of Ramsgate, Margate and Broadstairs were linked by 11 miles of track.

In 1915–1916, early aircraft began to use the open farmland at Manston as a site for emergency landings. The location near the Kent coast gave Manston some advantages over other previously established aerodromes. During the First World War, Ramsgate and its harbour were the target of bombing raids by Zeppelin airships and German Navy torpedo boats. By 1917 the Royal Flying Corps was well established and taking an active part in the defence of Britain. As RAF Manston, the aerodrome played an important role in the Second World War. It is now called Kent International Airport, but is currently not operational.

In 1923, Ramsgate elected its first woman Mayor, Janet Stancomb-Wills, after whom the Dame Janet Primary Academy on Newington Road is named. As the Second World War approached, Ramsgate Borough Council embarked on plans to create a network of Deep Shelter tunnels linking to a former railway tunnel which would provide shelter for 60,000 people. The tunnels were opened on 1 June 1939. In 2014 (75 years later), part of this network was opened to visitors.

In October 1939, the Royal Navy established a Coastal Forces base at Ramsgate called HMS &quot;Fervent&quot;, which operated Motor Torpedo Boats, Motor Gun Boats and Motor Launches until September 1945. From 27 May 1940, Ramsgate harbour was the main assembly point for the build-up of small craft needed for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk. Once the evacuation was under way, Ramsgate became the second-busiest port after Dover, and just under 43,000 men passed through the port, transported onwards by 82 special trains.

In 2017 Ramsgate was chosen as one of the first ten Heritage Action Zones (HAZ) by Historic England, with the aim of stimulating economic growth by taking advantage of Ramsgate&#x27;s historic environment. Part of this project included a Historic Landscape Characterisation Study which assessed and mapped the patterns of historic character in the town, using geological and topographical surveys, and covering aspects from the Neolithic, medieval, Georgian, Victorian, and through to the First and Second World War periods.

==Geography==

Ramsgate is located 78 miles from central London in an east south-easterly direction at one of the most easterly points of the United Kingdom (the furthest point east is Lowestoft in Suffolk).

The town is an amalgamation of two settlements: a fishing community on the coast in the shallow valley between two chalk cliffs, and an inland farming community that is now the Parish of St Lawrence. The cliffs are known as the East Cliff and the West Cliff and are predominantly residential areas. There are promenades along both cliff tops with parks at either end and sandy beaches on the coast.

===Climate===
Ramsgate has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) as is typical in the United Kingdom; the nearest Met Office weather station for which data is available is Manston Airport, about two miles west of the town centre.

The highest temperature ever recorded is 34.6 °C (94.3 °F) in August 2003, though typically the warmest day of the year averages 28.5 °C (83.3 °F) and 8.8 days will record a temperature of 25.1 °C (77.2 °F) or above.

The lowest recorded temperature is -14.5 °C (5.9 °F), in February 1986, though typically the coldest night of the year averages -6.2 °C (20.8 °F).
A total of 21.4 days of the year should record an air frost.

Rainfall averages around 600 mm per year, a figure similar to that for the driest parts of England. Over 1 mm of rain can be expected on 110.1 days. Averages refer to a mixture of the 1971–2000, 1981–2010 and 1991–2020 climate periods.

Being close to the coast, and in Southern England, sunshine compares favourably with most of the United Kingdom, at over 1800 hours a year. Only the Sussex coast tends to be notably sunnier, although much of the remainder of the south coast receives a similar amount of sunshine as Ramsgate.

==Governance==
Ramsgate is in the parliamentary constituency of East Thanet, which is represented by Labour MP Polly Billington. She won the seat in the 2024 general election, representing a Labour win after Craig Mackinlay held the seat for the Conservatives in the 2015 General Election. Before 2015 the MP for Ramsgate was Conservative Laura Sandys. She was preceded by Stephen Ladyman, a Labour minister; he was preceded by Jonathan Aitken.

Ramsgate was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1884. This was abolished in 1974, since when Ramsgate has been part of the Thanet local government district. The town is made up of seven electoral wards: Central Harbour, Cliffsend and Pegwell, Eastcliff, Nethercourt, Newington, Northwood, and Sir Moses Montefiore. These wards have seventeen of the fifty-six seats on the Thanet District Council; since the 2019 local elections eleven of those seats have been held by Labour, three by Thanet Independents, two by the Conservative Party and one by the Green Party. Currently the council is run by a Conservative minority.

Following a successful campaign by local activist Gerry O&#x27;Donnell, a town council was established for Ramsgate in June 2009. The Town Mayor of Ramsgate is currently Councillor Raushan Ara.

==Economy==

Ramsgate&#x27;s main industries are tourism and fishing. The town has a thriving marina with over 800 moorings and a range of marine-related businesses that operate in the renovated arches under Royal Parade. Colleges in the town also cater for students of English as a foreign language.

Although Ramsgate has the most valuable fish landings in Kent (~£700,000 in 2003), the fishing industry is in decline. The Port of Ramsgate has provided cross-channel ferries for many years. Previously, Sally Ferries UK provided a passenger and car ferry service to Dunkirk. Until April 2013, Transeuropa Ferries operated a freight and car ferry between Ramsgate and Oostende.

Unemployment in Thanet stands at 4.1%; this is higher than the national average (2.5%). There is some light industry in the town. An emerging industry is power generation, with 800 jobs expected to be created by the Thanet offshore wind project, a wind farm just off the coast. Ramsgate market is held in High Street, King Street and Queen Street every Friday and Saturday.

Ramsgate has a LETS scheme (RAMLETS) which was set up in 2014 enabling residents to trade goods and services using the virtual currency RAMs. It is working with the Newington Wellbeing Network to improve the lives of people living in the Newington ward of Ramsgate.

==Culture==

===Tourism===
The town&#x27;s main attraction is its coastline, particularly Ramsgate Main Sands, which was awarded a Blue Flag in 2015. Ramsgate&#x27;s wartime deep shelter tunnels are open to the public for tours, which have been running since 2014.

The town has a small population of feral rose-ringed parakeets. The story about them appearing in Ramsgate still remains a mystery. According to some sources, they may have flown away from the trading ships coming from British India in the 1800s. The local council publishes a website specifically aimed at tourists visiting Ramsgate and neighbouring towns.

There is an annual regatta event during the summer. Ramsgate Carnival is an annual parade that takes place during the summer. Other events include the annual Addington Street Fair and the French Market.

===Sport===
The town&#x27;s main football club, Ramsgate FC, plays in the Isthmian League Division One South. The local rivals of the club are Margate FC, situated 4 miles away. When the two teams meet, it is known as the &quot;Thanet Derby&quot;. The club run a reserves team, which plays in the Kent Football League Second Division, and a women&#x27;s team, which plays in the South East Counties Women&#x27;s League Kent County Division. Ramsgate FC run five youth teams; the under-13 to under-18 teams compete in the Valley Express Kent Youth League and the club also runs Ramsgate Youth U7 to U16, which play in the Molten East Kent Youth League. Two other youth teams in Ramsgate are Trinity and Hugin Vikings; both play in The Molten East Kent Youth League.

Thanet Wanderers is the island&#x27;s only rugby team and has played at London Division 1 level, achieving its best result by defeating Doncaster at Twickenham in the final of the Intermediate Cup in 1997. The club runs five senior sides and many junior teams, all of which play at St Peter&#x27;s. Cliftonville Hockey Club plays its home matches at St Lawrence College and has a clubhouse that it shares with Broadstairs Cricket Club.

Thanet Galaxy is a pan-disability football club that provides structured coaching for male and female footballers of all ages, who qualify within the nationally and internationally recognised Pan Disability categories. The club trains at Chatham House Grammar School and plays in Kent Disability Football League in three age bands: U-11, U-16, and 16+.

Ramsgate&#x27;s sports facilities include a public swimming pool, and a fitness centre with a gym and sports hall. Tennis clubs can be found at Spencer Square and St Laurence. Ramsgate has three golf clubs: St Augustine&#x27;s, Stonelees, and Manston. There is also a sailing club, the Royal Temple Yacht Club, which is steeped in yacht-racing history and hosts racing throughout the year for a variety of historic trophies. The highlight of the season is the annual international sailing regatta, known as &#x27;Ramsgate Week&#x27;, which is usually held in August.

===Arts and local media===
The Gallery IOTA (Isle Of Thanet Arts) was based on the town&#x27;s west cliff but is now on the harbour front.
Ramsgate Maritime Museum near the harbour quayside has exhibits showing the evolution of Ramsgate Harbour and east Kent maritime history. The Museum Building featured in the 2018 romantic comedy &quot;Juliet, Naked&quot; as the fictional Sandcliff Museum where the film&#x27;s star Annie Platt (Rose Bryne) works. The King&#x27;s Theatre, near the town centre, offers shows, community events and a seniors&#x27; club every Monday. Talks on Ramsgate&#x27;s history are frequently held there.

Ramsgate has two paid-for newspapers, the &quot;Isle of Thanet Gazette&quot; and &quot;Thanet Times&quot;, both of which are owned by Northcliffe Media. Free newspapers covering the town include the &quot;Thanet Extra&quot;, part of the KM Group; and &quot;yourthanet&quot;, belonging to KOS Media.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East &amp; ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Dover TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in the town centre. 

The local radio stations are KMFM Thanet, owned by the KM Group, community radio station Academy FM (Thanet), and the county-wide stations Heart South, Gold and BBC Radio Kent. Thanet Community Radio (TCR) offers an online arts- and features-based service for Thanet District and the surrounding area where people can listen to podcasts of local interest.

===Landmarks===
The Hugin is a reconstructed Viking longship located at Pegwell Bay in Ramsgate. It was a gift from the Danish government in commemoration of the 1500th anniversary of the legendary arrival of conquering brothers Hengist and Horsa to England in the year 449.

==Architecture==
There are many Regency and Victorian buildings in Ramsgate. In all, there are 900 listed buildings in the town with more than 200 in the vicinity of the harbour. One of the town&#x27;s most notable buildings is the 18th century Townley House designed by Mary Townley.

The town has three notable churches:

*The first building used for worship in the Thanet parish of St Lawrence was at St Laurence-in-Thanet; it was built in 1062 and rebuilt during the following centuries, with the most significant changes made in the 16th century. Note the difference in spelling between the village of St Lawrence and its church, which is dedicated to the Roman martyr Laurence.

*The second notable church is St Augustine&#x27;s, on the town&#x27;s West Cliff. It was designed by Augustus Pugin in 1847 in the Gothic Revival style. Its dedication commemorates Augustine, the first Archbishop of Canterbury, who landed at Ramsgate in AD 597 bringing Christianity to Britain. In March 2012 the church was designated a shrine to St Augustine of Canterbury; this ended a five-century absence of a shrine to St Augustine, as the original (at St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Canterbury) had been destroyed during the Reformation.

*The town&#x27;s parish church of St George is situated just off the High Street. Its lantern tower was added at the request of Trinity House as a navigational aid to passing ships, and it looks over the town. The ground was consecrated on 23 October 1827.

St Augustine&#x27;s is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark, whilst St Laurence and St George are both Church of England and serve the Anglican community as part of the Diocese of Canterbury. Christ Church, built in 1847, also serves the Anglican community.

Ramsgate library was originally built and paid for by Andrew Carnegie in 1904. On the evening of Friday 13 August 2004, it was destroyed by fire just two months short of its 100th anniversary. Though suspicions were raised about the causes of the fire, due to a similarly timed fire at Aberdeen House (the town&#x27;s registry office), an investigation was unable to establish how the fire had started.

Shortly after the blaze, planning permission was granted for a new library. The library was fully restored, and was officially re-opened on 20 February 2009.

==Transport==
===By sea===
The Port of Ramsgate has a 700 berth marina, &quot;Royal Harbour Marina&quot;, and a ferry terminal built on reclaimed land. The harbour provides shelter from the effects of storms. The Goodwin Sands are nearby. In 2005, the marina had 12,000 visiting boats. Transeuropa Ferries passenger (with vehicle only) and freight ferries sailed until April 2013 to the Port of Ostend in Ostend, Belgium. The Port of Ramsgate has its own road access tunnel from outside the town, avoiding town centre congestion. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution&#x27;s Ramsgate Lifeboat Station is in Ramsgate Harbour.

===By road===
Ramsgate is connected to the national road network primarily through the A299 Thanet Way, which continues on to the M2/A2 for the M25 (approx 1 hour) and London. The A256 provides a link to Dover and onwards to the A20 for the Channel Tunnel. Bus services are provided by Stagecoach South East and also serve Broadstairs, Canterbury, Sandwich and Margate.

===By rail===

Ramsgate railway station is situated at the top of the town near the parish of St Lawrence.

A new high-speed service to London St Pancras started in December 2009, running on High Speed 1, the UK&#x27;s first high-speed rail line, between London and Kent. The journey time from Ramsgate to St Pancras is 76 minutes.

In March 2015, it was announced that journey times between Ramsgate and London St Pancras are expected to be reduced to 63 minutes in 2019, due to infrastructure enhancements.

Other trains run from Ramsgate to London Charing Cross and London Victoria. Commuting time to the capital on these lines is approximately 1 hour 50 minutes.

Trains from Ramsgate are routed via Margate, Chatham and Bromley South, or via Canterbury West or Dover Priory and Ashford International. Ramsgate railway station is operated by Southeastern who operate all services.

Thanet Parkway railway station, opened on 31 July 2023, is situated near the village of Cliffsend just outside Ramsgate, and easily accessible by road off of the A299 (Hengist Way).

===By air===

A municipal airport was opened on 1 July 1935, operating until World War II broke out in 1939. Following a short spell as a satellite of RAF Manston, it closed in 1940. The airport was re-opened in 1952 and operated until closure in 1968.

From September 2004 to August 2005 a low-cost airline EUjet operated frequent flights to many European destinations, replacing a large freight operator. However, flights were suspended after the collapse of its parent company, PlaneStation Group plc.

Manston was sold to Infratil on 26 August 2005. Until May 2014, KLM Cityhopper operated two daily passenger flights from the airport to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands. The airport was regularly used by freight operators such as Cargolux and Meridian.

The airport was sold to Ann Gloag in November 2013. She was reported to be seeking a buyer, but her spokesman reported that a buyer had not been found, and the airport closed on 15 May 2014.

If the airport were to resume operations, the town would be directly under the flight path.

<text>East Kilbride (; ), sometimes referred to as EK, is the largest town in South Lanarkshire in Scotland, and the country&#x27;s sixth-largest locality by population. Historically a small village, it was designated Scotland&#x27;s first &quot;new town&quot; on 6 May 1947. The area lies on a raised plateau to the south of the Cathkin Braes, about southeast of Glasgow and close to the boundary with East Renfrewshire.

The town ends close to the White Cart Water to the west and is bounded by the Rotten Calder Water to the east. Immediately to the north of the modern town centre is The Village, the part of East Kilbride that existed before its post-war development into a New Town. East Kilbride is twinned with the town of Ballerup, in Denmark.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The earliest-known evidence of occupation in the area dates as far back as the late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, as archaeological investigation has demonstrated that burial cairns in the district began as ceremonial or ritual sites of burial during the Neolithic, with the use of cup-marked, and other inscribed stones at key elevated sites, only to be later built upon with earth and re-used for burial into the Bronze Age.

These findings have found further support through ongoing research indicating that many East Kilbride Cairns first noticed by the Reverend David Ure in his &quot;History of Rutherglen and East Kilbride&quot; (1793), are embedded, alongside other monuments, into a ritual landscape related to ancestor cults and relationships with key topographical features and annual solar events. A flint arrow head was discovered by Allan Forrest, a then child resident whilst groundworks were taking place in his family&#x27;s garden at Glen Bervie, St Leonards in 1970 which later was identified as dating to 1500 BC (Bronze Age).

Prehistoric – possibly Roman – graves have also been found near the Kype Water close to town of Strathaven, some distance from East Kilbride but suggesting a Roman context for the wider area. Roman coins, footwear, and a Romano-British oil lamp have also been found in the area.

===History===
East Kilbride traditionally takes its name from an Irish saint named St Bride (or Brigit), who may have founded a monastery for nuns and monks in Kildare in Leinster, Ireland, in the 6th century. Dál Riatan monks afterwards introduced her order to parts of Scotland, although the origins of the East Kilbride example - situated in the West of Scotland, is less certain due to a lack of early historical or linguistic involvement with Dalriada.

The Scots anglicisation &quot;kil&quot; takes its root from the Gaelic &quot;cille&quot;, borrowed from the Latin for cell or chapel, of St Brigit. the use of &quot;cille&quot; to mark a probable dedication to an Irish saint in this part of Scotland is problematic due to linguistic dating issues, but some analysis suggests that churches with &quot;cille&quot; place-names in the south west represent an early and short-lived influx of Irish church influence in or before the eighth century, which may or may not have involved the &quot;Céilí Dé&quot; who were monastics. However, it has been suggested by Prof. T. O. Clancy and others that &quot;cille&quot; place-names in the region, including the East Kilbride example, may instead relate to the main period of Gaelic cultural influx in the period post 900 AD.

The original parish church was located on what may have been a site of a pre-Christian significance, and tentatively the origin of the association with St Brigit, since the site may be dedicated to the Celtic goddess Brigid, whose traditions have been continued through the reverence of St Brigit brought on by the Celtic Church. However, this view is unpopular amongst academic audiences due to a complete lack of evidence supporting such earlier origins, thus making it an unfalsifiable concept.

Alternatively, the later dedication may commemorate the Scottish St Bryde, who is alleged to have been born in 451 AD and died at Abernethy 74 years later. However, this is also the same year Brigit is supposed to have been born, and the same year of her death.

Culdee-type Christian settlements were essential to the spread of the Celtic church in Scotland, with small pagan sites being converted and chapels or cells forming little more than crude shelters, or timber and turf buildings with crude circular enclosures. Additionally, the number of place-name dedications to St. Brigit in Scotland is further evidence of the possibility of Culdee activity in the southwest, if extrapolations are allowed from known areas of culdee activity. How this possibility relates to the relatively late dating-periods in the British kingdom of Strathclyde has not been explored owing to a lack of surviving written sources to provide insights for this geographical area.

===Contemporary History===

In the early 18th century, the word &#x27;East&#x27; was added to the name of East Kilbride, and &#x27;West&#x27; to West Kilbride to distinguish the towns from each other.

East Kilbride grew from a small village of around 900 inhabitants in 1930 to become a large burgh in 1967. The rapid industrialisation of the 20th century underpins this growth and left much of the working population throughout Scotland&#x27;s Central Belt, from Glasgow to Edinburgh, living in the housing stock built at the end of the previous century. The Great War postponed any housing improvements, as did the Treaty of Versailles and the period of post-war settlement it created. In turn, this was followed by the Great Depression. After the Second World War, Glasgow, already suffering from chronic housing shortages, incurred bomb damage from the war. In 1946, the Clyde Valley Regional Plan allocated sites where overspill satellite &quot;new towns&quot; could be constructed to help alleviate the housing shortage. Glasgow would also undertake the development of its peripheral housing estates. East Kilbride was the first of six new towns in Scotland to be designated, in 1947, followed by Glenrothes (1948), Cumbernauld (1956), Livingston (1962), Irvine (1964) and Stonehouse (1972), although Stonehouse new town was never built.

The planned town has been subdivided into residential precincts, each with its own local shops, primary schools and community facilities. The housing precincts surround the shopping centre, which is bound by a ring road. Industrial estates were concentrated on the outskirts of the town in northern, western and south-eastern directions (Nerston, College Milton and Kelvin respectively).

The Calderglen gorge bordering the eastern fringe of East Kilbride, was celebrated in a high number of printed works as a picturesque forest and &#x27;magnificent in its grouping of craggy heights, sprinkled with trees and [...] the richly wooded and festooned valley&#x27;, and with &#x27;delightful cascades&#x27;, and described as indescribable, or as &#x27;the GRAND, the ROMANTIC, and BEAUTIFUL&#x27; - the latter being the only part of David Ure&#x27;s book where he emphasised the descriptive characteristics of a place in bold characters. The northern part of the gorge and adjoining Calderwood, the gorge&#x27;s namesake, was the home of an ancient family known as the &#x27;Maxwells of Calderwood&#x27; who resided in Calderwood Castle, and were the oldest branch of the Maxwells of Pollok. The remnants of Calderwood Castle were demolished in 1951 and only a few parts of the structure remain. &quot;Calderglen Heritage&quot; formally constituted in early 2017 as a body to protect, record, and restore local and national interest in the areas of the former Calderwood and Torrance estates of Calderglen.

The story of how workers at the Rolls-Royce factory in East Kilbride prevented engines for military jets being serviced and supplied between 1974 until 1978 to the Chilean military dictatorship is told in the 2018-released documentary, &quot;Nae Pasaran&quot;. The factory was scheduled for closure in 2017 and was subsequently demolished and the land (at Nerston Industrial Estate) used for housing; a monument consisting of one of the unrepaired engines was installed at the town&#x27;s South Lanarkshire College in 2019.

==Geography==
Hamilton, the administrative headquarters for South Lanarkshire Council, is about east of East Kilbride. The A725 road linking the towns also passes Blantyre and one of the University of the West of Scotland campuses, with links to Bothwell, Motherwell and ultimately to the M74 and M8 motorways.

The nearest Glasgow district of Castlemilk is about northwest, with the Cathkin Braes, farmland and the village of Carmunnock in between; a bypass (the B766) was built in 1988 to remove Glasgow traffic from Carmunnock. Rutherglen and Cambuslang lie about the same distance to the north-east and are linked to East Kilbride via the dual carriageway A749 road which continues into Glasgow.

Clarkston and Busby are also about northwest via the A727 road, with Thorntonhall much closer. Eaglesham lies about west of East Kilbride centre; the Glasgow Southern Orbital, another modern bypass which is part of the A726 road, keeps East Kilbride traffic heading for the M77 motorway away from Eaglesham and Newton Mearns.

The closest town to the south of East Kilbride is Strathaven, about away via another section of the A726. The majority of land in the area in between is taken up by Whitelee Wind Farm on the moorland hills to the southwest, including Elrig close to where one of the principal feeder burns of the Calder Water originates. The Calder itself flows northwards past East Kilbride adjacent to Blantyre, before joining the River Clyde opposite Daldowie near Newton.

East Kilbride is often considered to form part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. However, the urban area is not directly connected to any other, being designed from the outset to serve as a self-contained town with some commute requirements to Glasgow. The hamlets of Nerston, Kittochside, Auldhouse and Jackton which were once separate settlements are now on the periphery of the expanding town. Statistically, as of 2020 it is the sixth-largest locality (a single defined populated place) in Scotland with a population of , but only the tenth-largest settlement, as these are formed by connected clusters of localities: for example neighbouring Hamilton&#x27;s settlement – – is combined with Blantyre, Bothwell and Uddingston to exceed the population of isolated East Kilbride, with neither counted as part of Greater Glasgow under this definition.

East Kilbride is divided into a number of smaller neighbourhoods bordered by main through-roads. Part of the new town design was that each of these would be a self-contained entity, with a variety of housing types, local shops and primary schools, and accessed safely for pedestrians via paths and underpasses separate from main roads. This is true for the original areas of the new town (principally Calderwood, Greenhills, The Murray, St Leonards and Westwood) while newer developments, such as Stewartfield, Lindsayfield and Mossneuk do not adhere as closely to this model and have a more generic suburban layout of low-density private housing, arranged mainly in cul-de-sacs fed by distributor roads.

==Governance==
East Kilbride Civic Centre, which was commissioned by the burgh of East Kilbride was designed by Scott Fraser &amp; Browning, built by Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts and completed in 1968. From 1975 East Kilbride lent its name to a local government district in the Strathclyde region. From creation until 1980 the East Kilbride District Council was governed by the Scottish National Party (SNP), subsequently, until dissolution, the district was under the control of Labour. In 1996, administrative functions were taken over by the South Lanarkshire unitary council.

There is an East Kilbride constituency of the Scottish Parliament. From the opening of the Scottish Parliament, the constituency was represented by Andy Kerr MSP (Labour), until May 2011 when the seat was won by Linda Fabiani MSP (Scottish National Party).

East Kilbride was formerly a constituency of the UK Parliament. In 2005 it was replaced by the constituency of East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow. The seat was held from 1987 to 2010 by Labour politician, Adam Ingram. In the 2010 election Labour politician, Michael McCann, previously a South Lanarkshire Councillor was elected as the MP for the area. In the 2015 election, Lisa Cameron for the SNP was elected as part of the landslide victory the party had in Scotland, with Cameron, after holding the seat in 2017 and 2019, defecting to the Conservatives in 2023.

This seat was abolished for the 2024 general election and largely replaced by East Kilbride and Strathaven which was won by Joani Reid, the Scottish Labour candidate.

==Economy==

The town centre is occupied by a large shopping centre comprising six linked malls (The Plaza (development started in 1972), Princes Mall (1984), Southgate (1989), Princes Square (1997), Centre West (2003) and The Hub (2016)).

A £400m redevelopment of part of East Kilbride shopping centre was approved in 2006 by South Lanarkshire Council. The plan proposed demolishing some existing buildings to create a new civic centre, health centre, library and shopping facilities. The shopping centre&#x27;s owners went into administration in 2022. There are plans to demolish a large part of the Centre West segment and turn this into housing with the overall retail space to be reduced and new civic amenities to be built.

A branch of the government&#x27;s Department for International Development, now the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, is located in the western Hairmyres area of East Kilbride.

==Religion==
There are approximately 30 Christian churches in East Kilbride. This includes nine Church of Scotland churches, three Baptist churches, and four Roman Catholic churches. St Bride&#x27;s RC church is a category A listed building. St Mark&#x27;s Episcopal church is situated in the Murray. There is one Lutheran parish of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of England, which is located in the Westwood hill area. An Evangelical Christian congregation is also located in the Westwood area. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints meeting hall is situated in Vancouver Drive, Westwood. Two congregations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses share a Kingdom Hall near the centre of the town. The Christadelphians meet in Calderwood Community Centre. There are two United Reformed Churches, one in the Village, and one in the Murray. In the Greenhills area is a congregation of the Methodist church, whose premises are currently shared by the Seventh Day Adventist church. An Islamic Centre opened in 2018.

==Transport==

East Kilbride is connected to Glasgow city centre by road and rail. Three main roads connect East Kilbride with surrounding suburbs and the city, one being the A727 (formerly A726) leading west to Busby and on to Clarkston Toll. Another route being the A749 which runs north into Rutherglen. Recently, the addition of the Glasgow Southern Orbital road links the west of the town directly with Newton Mearns and the M77; this road has taken over the designation A726. Similar to other New Towns, the road network within the area is populated by many roundabouts, which credible survey work as of August 2023 numbers at 199, inclusive of all types of roundabout and exclusive of traffic islands not functioning as roundabouts. This is despite much spurious reference elsewhere numbering them at over 600. Glaswegians jokingly refer to East Kilbride as &quot;Polo mint City&quot; after the round, mint sweet. The main dual carriageway road running north–south through the town is known as the Kingsway, while the main east–west road is known as the Queensway.

===Public transport===
East Kilbride bus station, at the East Kilbride Shopping Centre, was rebuilt in June 2005 with modern facilities, including 14 rapid drive-through stances, allowing quick turnover of buses. East Kilbride railway station is situated in the Village, about a 10-minute walk from the bus station. Trains depart to Glasgow Central railway station every half-hour, with a journey time of about 27 minutes. The town is also served by Hairmyres railway station in Hairmyres.

East Kilbride&#x27;s primary bus operator is First Glasgow which provides regular services to the city centre, Busby, Clarkston, Castlemilk, Rutherglen, Blantyre, Hamilton, Motherwell and to many other destinations across Greater Glasgow.

====Bus station====

East Kilbride bus station is managed and operated by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport. It is situated by East Kilbride Shopping Centre and is situated right outside the Princes Mall section of the Shopping Centre, and is easily accessible from the Olympia Arcade section also. It is approximately a 10-minute walk from the town&#x27;s rail station.

The current bus station went under a major £4 million expansion and re-planning of the existing site to form 14 rapid drive-through stances with new travel centre and CAB facility at the eastern gateway to the Town Centre. The bus station, which was designed by the architectural firm CDA, opened in 2005. The brief given to the designers was that they were &quot;to achieve a fast turn around of buses, safe pedestrian/vehicular segregation and a secure and accessible environment set within an attractive urban realm&quot;.

There are 14 stances (stands) at the bus station that are equipped with electronic displays showing the next few departures. There is also a Travel Centre which is open Saturdays between 9.00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. The operators at the bus station are First Glasgow, McGill&#x27;s Bus Services, JMB Travel and Whitelaw&#x27;s Coaches.

===Cycling===
Many of the busy roundabouts in East Kilbride feature underpasses which allow pedestrians and cyclists safe access across roads. On 19 June 2009, National Cycling Route 756, connecting East Kilbride and Rutherglen with the City Boundary, was opened. In November 2007, South Lanarkshire Council published three cycle routes, named the &quot;East Kilbride Cycle Network&quot; which start at the East Kilbride Shopping Centre in the centre of the town and are signposted. Route One is route is to Strathaven, via Newlandsmuir; Route Two to St Leonard&#x27;s Shopping Centre, and Route Three is to Calderglen Country Park. Incidentally East Kilbride prior to new town development was a prized health resort, with cycling being a popular pastime there from the late 19th to early 20th centuries.

==Leisure and culture==

East Kilbride as a new town was designed to provide elements of culture, sport, and heritage for residents so as to create a sense of belonging and place.

*The James Hamilton Heritage Park is a park primarily containing a man-made loch with water sports facilities and surrounding nature sanctuary, adjacent to the Category A listed, 15th-century Mains Castle, now a private residence.
*The Dollan Baths is one of the most significant buildings of an earlier phase of development. The leisure complex (opened 1968) has category A listed status is regarded as an outstanding and rare example of a mid-20th century public amenity building in a striking internationally inspired design. Inspired by Pier Luigi Nervi&#x27;s Olympic complex in Rome, it is also very similar to the complex built for the 1964 Japanese Olympic Games. Its pool was the first champion-sized swimming pool in Scotland although was built long but only six lanes wide, as compared with the Olympic standard which requires a length of exactly 50 m and a width of ten lanes; a local urban myth said it was built too short to be of Olympic Standard, rather than too few lanes. The Aqua Centre re-opened on 28 May 2011 after a major refurbishment costing £6.5 million.
*Long Calderwood Farm was formerly Hunter House Museum, and contained exhibits relating to the medical and veterinary pioneers, doctors William and John Hunter, who were born on the estate. It closed as a museum after the financial crash to later open again as a café operated by the neighbouring Calderwood Baptist Church. The largest single collection of historical archives and records pertaining to East Kilbride parish is that owned or managed by the EK&amp;DH Archive, which is administered by a private board of trustees comprising archivists, historians, and business advisors. This collection of upwards of 630,000 records is accessible by appointment or remotely using dedicated consultation spaces.
*East Kilbride Central Library holds the primary fiction and non-fiction reading stock as well as some local reference collections, photographs and records, representing some of the history of both East Kilbride new town and the earlier parish, whilst South Lanarkshire Archives based at College Milton holds publicly accessible extensive development archives related to East Kilbride Development Corporation and records of local council authorities.
*St Bride&#x27;s Church was designed by the architects Gillespie, Kidd and Coia and built between 1957 and 1964.
*Langlands Moss is a local nature reserve which comprises a Lowland Raised Peat Bog, a UK BAP priority habitat. The reserve is owned by South Lanarkshire Council and maintained by The Friends of Langlands Moss L.N.R.
*The National Museum of Rural Life is located at the 18-century, Category A-listed Wester Kittochside Farm (donated to the National Trust for Scotland in 1949 and set up to demonstrate farming practices of that era) and at a modern, purpose-built building off Stewartfield Road, the sites connected for visitors by a short tractor journey across the fields.

The town is also home to East Kilbride Arts Centre, a popular arts and performance venue, as well as the longstanding Village Theatre. The town hosted the National Mòd in 1975.

<text>Cambuslang (, from ) is a town on the south-eastern outskirts of Greater Glasgow, Scotland. With approximately 30,000 residents, it is the 27th largest town in Scotland by population, although, never having had a town hall, it may also be considered the largest village in Scotland. It is within the local authority area of South Lanarkshire and directly borders the town of Rutherglen to the west. Historically, it was a large civil parish incorporating the nearby hamlets of Newton, Flemington, Westburn and Halfway.

Cambuslang is located just south of the River Clyde and about southeast of the centre of Glasgow. It has a long history of coal mining, from at least 1490, iron and steel making, and ancillary engineering works, most recently The Hoover Company (in the town from 1946 to 2005). The Clydebridge Steelworks and other smaller manufacturing businesses continue but most employment in the area comes from the distribution or service industries. The headquarters of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is in Cambuslang.
==History==

The local geography of Cambuslang explains a great deal of its history. It has been very prosperous over time, depending first upon its agricultural land (supplying food, then wool, then linen), then the mineral resources under its soil (limestone and coal and to some extent, iron). These were guarded by the medieval Church, and later by the local aristocracy, particularly the Duke of Hamilton (previously Barons of Cadzow and Earls of Arran).

Because of its relative prosperity, Cambuslang has been intimately concerned in the politics of the country (through the Hamilton connection) and of the local Church. Bishop John Cameron of Glasgow, and Cardinal Beaton, were both Rectors of Cambuslang. This importance continued following the Protestant Reformation. From then until the Glorious Revolution a stream of Ministers of Cambuslang came, were expelled, or were re-instated, according to whether supporters of the King, Covenanters, or Oliver Cromwell were in power. The religious movements of the 18th century, including the Cambuslang Wark, were directly linked to similar movements in North America. The Scottish Enlightenment was well represented in the person of Rev Dr James Meek, the Minister. His troubles with his parishioners foreshadowed the split in the Church of Scotland during the 19th century.

The manufacturing industries that grew up from the agricultural and mineral resources attracted immigrants from all over Scotland and Ireland and other European countries. Cambuslang benefited at all times from its closeness to the burgeoning city of Glasgow, brought closer in the 18th century by a turnpike road then, in the 19th century, by a railway. In the 21st century, it continues to derive benefit from its proximity to Glasgow and to wider communication networks, particularly via the M74 motorway system. Its increasing (and increasingly diverse) population posed problems, over the centuries, of employment and housing as well as of schooling and health, not all of which have been solved; in this regard, it is fairly typical of most Scottish towns.

In sport, Cambuslang F.C. were founder members of the Scottish Football League whose most notable achievement was being the runners-up in the 1887–88 Scottish Cup. They folded by the early 20th century, as did Scottish Junior Cup winners Cambuslang Hibernian, but a new team Cambuslang Rangers F.C. was established and continues to this day – they enjoyed great success in the 1970s.

==Governance==
===Westminster===
Cambuslang is in the Rutherglen Constituency for elections to the House of Commons at Westminster, having been within Rutherglen and Hamilton West between 2005 and 2024.

As of October 2023, Michael Shanks of the Scottish Labour Party is the local MP. He won a by-election after the previous incumbent Margaret Ferrier, latterly an independent, was removed in a recall petition. Ferrier won the 2015 and 2019 elections representing the Scottish National Party, with Labour&#x27;s Ged Killen serving from 2017 to 2019. Michael Shanks retained the seat comfortably when the revived Rutherglen constituency was first contested in 2024.

===Holyrood===
Cambuslang was originally in the Glasgow Rutherglen Constituency for the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood. In 2011 the boundaries were redrawn and the new constituency renamed simply &quot;Rutherglen&quot;, despite its boundaries taking in not only Cambuslang but also Blantyre.

In the 2016 election, Clare Haughey won the seat for the SNP with 15,222 votes, giving a majority of 11.4%, replacing James Kelly who had been elected both in 2007 and 2011. Haughey was re-elected in 2021 with a slightly increased majority. Kelly remained in the Parliament as a &#x27;list member&#x27; for the Glasgow region, elected on a proportional representation basis, until 2021.

===South Lanarkshire Council===
Administratively, the town centre is within the Cambuslang West ward of South Lanarkshire Council, which has a population of around 15,000. Taking another ward encompassing the eastern parts of the town into consideration, its overall population was approximately 30,000 in 2016. With neighbouring Rutherglen&#x27;s figures being very similar, the many services and amenities shared between the towns should provide for 60,000 residents, many assessed as living in economic hardship.

*South Lanarkshire Council election results detailing local wards: 1995, 1999; 2003; 2007; 2012; 2017; 2022.

==Geography==
Cambuslang is located on a lengthy bend on the River Clyde, south-east of Glasgow. The town is accessible from the nearby M74; the nearby A724 links to Glasgow city centre and Hamilton; the town is also accessible by car from East Kilbride by the A725, A749 and then the B759. The town&#x27;s railway station, Cambuslang, lies on the Argyle Line between central Glasgow and Lanark.

The Reverend Dr John Robertson, Minister of Cambuslang Kirk, described the Parish in the Second Statistical Account of Scotland 1845. &quot;It is bounded by the Clyde on the north, which separates it from the Parish of Old Monkland; by the Calder on the east, which separates it from Blantyre; by part of Blantyre and Kilbryde, on the south; and by Carmunnock and Rutherglen on the west.&quot; The highest points in this low-lying Parish are Dechmont Hill (602 ft) and Turnlaw (or Turnlea) Hill (553 ft.) There are remains of an Iron Age fort on Dechmont.

==Landmarks==

Cambuslang has an interesting range of churches, public buildings, schools, industrial and commercial buildings (see Buildings of Cambuslang). Its domestic buildings range from 19th-century mansions, villas and tenements to modern flats and detached houses, along with sheltered and nursing homes.

===Sites===
Cambuslang Park spans encompassing the contrast of open parkland and the Borgie Glen, which is a steep tree-lined ravine, containing a complex network of pathways. The park also features a pond, sports pitches, war memorial (depicting a soldier in a kilt), woodland areas and the Bandstand, which is a natural amphitheatre, near where the famous Cambuslang Wark took place in the 18th century.

==Education==
There is a range of schools in Cambuslang, and a history of further education colleges, although there are no longer any in the town.

===Primary schools===
Primary schools (&quot;2022–23 pupil roll in parentheses&quot;: 
*Cairns Primary School (333)
*Hallside Primary School (254)
*James Aiton Primary School (148)
*Newton Farm Primary School (639)
*Park View Primary School (206)
*St Bride&#x27;s Primary School (273)
*St Cadoc&#x27;s Primary School (140)
*St Charles&#x27; Primary School (350)
*West Coats Primary School (409)

===Secondary schools===
*Cathkin High School (1006)
*Trinity High School (1186)
*Rutherglen High School (additional support needs) (110)

Some parts of Cambuslang are within the catchment area of Stonelaw High School, which is situated in Rutherglen, the adjoining town. Uddingston Grammar School, one train stop from Cambuslang on the Motherwell via Bellshill line, includes Newton Farm Primary in its catchment.

===Colleges===

Cambuslang College of the Building Trades was a specialist college established in the mid-twentieth century but it gradually expanded to teach other trades and academic subjects. It became Cambuslang College of Further Education in the 1960s, and went on to open a campus in East Kilbride, as well as facilities in Hamilton and Wishaw. A substantial annexe remained in Cambuslang on Hamilton Road, by now located in the former Gateside School. Reflecting its wider geographical coverage, it became South Lanarkshire College in 2000. In 2008, the Cambuslang campus closed and all South Lanarkshire College facilities were moved to a new, custom-built campus in East Kilbride.

South Lanarkshire College has links with University of the West of Scotland, Hamilton Campus, a degree-awarding higher education institution, away in Hamilton, so that local students can progress through to degrees.

As well as hosting the headquarters of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the Scottish national training centre for firefighters is based in Cambuslang (having previously been located in Gullane, East Lothian).

===Early schools in Cambuslang===
There has been a Parish school in Cambuslang at least since the Reformation, and probably before that. The schoolteacher was appointed and paid by the heritors, though he also charged fees. Free primary education came with the Education Act for Scotland (1871). 
The original Cambuslang Public School can be seen on Greenlees Road, where it is now Greenlees Care Home. It had been for some time the Cambuslang College of the Building Trades, which became part of Cambuslang College (now South Lanarkshire College ). An even earlier school is now a Gospel Hall in Bushiehill Street.
The Cambuslang Subscription School of 1848 provided basic education to the children of miners and weavers in return for a few coppers. It was attractive to those who did not like the influence of the gentry and the minister on the parish school.

==Transport==
 There are three railway stations within the boundaries of Cambuslang - Cambuslang itself, on the Argyle Line section of the West Coast Main Line, Kirkhill on the Newton branch of the Cathcart Circle, and Newton, which is situated at a junction serving all of the aforementioned lines. Several bus routes pass through Cambuslang, with First Bus Glasgow currently operating most services between Lanarkshire and Glasgow. Several private hire taxi firms currently operate out of Cambuslang too.

National Cycle Route 75 passes through Cambuslang and extensive cycle lanes were added to the Main Street (A724) in 2016, although these were to prove controversial.

==Notable natives/residents==
===Cadoc===
St Cadoc (c 497 – c 580), also called &quot;&quot;Cadow&quot; or &quot;Cattwg&quot;, reputedly founded a monastery on the site of the present &quot;Old Parish Church&quot; in the later sixth century. He is the patron saint of Cambuslang, where there is a modern primary school named after him. His feast day is 25 September. In medieval times, &quot;Cadoc&quot; was called on for help by (among others) deaf people and those suffering from cramp.

He was a Celtic saint – previously, a Prince of Glamorgan – who brought succour to the native Christians against the invading Saxons. Cambuslang is at the northernmost reach of the Welsh speaking Brythons, so he may well have visited here in his wanderings, or in an effort to secure help against the Saxons. He had travelled to Ireland, to Brittany (to visit the Welsh-speaking monks there), Rome (the centre of Western Christianity) and Jerusalem (from where he brought back two altar stones that had touched the Holy Sepulchre.

The Europe he walked through was being battered by the barbarian invasions, so it is not improbable that he managed to reach Cambuslang. However, as no mention is made in the legends of an expedition this far north, it might have been a disciple, or a pilgrim returning from Glamorgan with a relic, who established the church at Cambuslang. Cadoc was cut down, while serving Mass, by a Saxon raiding party at &quot;Benevenna&quot;, most probably near Weedon Bec, Northamptonshire.

St Cadoc was prestigious enough in his lifetime for local chiefs to have recourse to him to settle disputes. This reputation lasted well into the Middle Ages, where solemn bonds and oaths were sworn over his (or his followers&#x27;) remains. Just before the Reformation, a wealthy Cambuslang notable expressed in his will a desire to be interred &quot;with the ashes of St Cadoc&quot;, in the Parish Kirk.

===David Dale===
David Dale (1739–1806) was a Scottish industrialist and philanthropist. His efforts to establish a cotton-spinning factory at Flemington failed but he was very successful as co-founder of the New Lanark Mills in 1786. Dale owned the estate of Rosebank in Cambuslang, which he used as a summer retreat from his townhouse (reputedly still standing) in Charlotte Street Glasgow and to where he retired and lived until his death. The estate was sold after his death to the Caledonian Railway Company, which divided it in two to accommodate the new railway. The half to the north of the railway line, including Rosebank House, eventually became Rosebank Industrial Estate. The southern half was sold to Thomas Gray Buchanan, a Glasgow merchant, related to the Buchanan who established Buchanan Street in Glasgow, who established a country retreat at Wellshott House, but his son Michael sold off the lands to build suburban villas in the 1860s.

===James Meek===
Rev Dr James Meek (1739–1810) was Minister of Cambuslang from 1774 until his death. He had been Dean of the Chapel at Glasgow University, when the Rector was Edmund Burke and the professors included the philosopher Thomas Reid. He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1795. He wrote the entry for Cambuslang in the First Statistical Account of Scotland. The cool, objective account in his report of the Cambuslang Wark remains the prime historical source for that event. He kept a detailed &quot;Journal and Register of the Weather&quot;...&quot; for each day over 29 years, with remarks on weather and events throughout Britain and the world. This Journal is still quoted in modern histories of the weather. He is buried in the &quot;Old Parish Church&quot; kirkyard, just inside the gate.

<text>The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS; ) is the official statistical institution of Palestine. Its main task is to provide credible statistical figures at the national and international levels. It is a state institution that provides service to the governmental, non – governmental and private sectors in addition to research institutions and universities. It is established as an independent statistical bureau. The PCBS publishes the &quot;Statistical Yearbook of Palestine&quot; and the &quot;Jerusalem Statistical Yearbook&quot; annually.

The head office of the agency is in Ein Munjed Quarter, Ramallah.

==Activities==
Besides general statistics, such as the Retail Price Index, the PCBS also carries out special projects. It conducted the first Palestinian census in 1997, although Israel prevented the national census team from surveying the population in East Jerusalem. In 2007, the second census was carried out. In the 2007 census, a limited census was carried out in East Jerusalem.

Also, the PCBS provided the 2003 &quot;Survey on the Impact of separation Wall on the Location Where it Passed Through&quot;.

The PCBS publishes the &quot;Statistical Yearbook of Palestine&quot; and the &quot;Jerusalem Statistical Yearbook&quot; annually.

==Offices==
The PCBS has its main office in the Balu&#x27;a area of Ramallah. In October 2001, the building was raided by the Israeli Defence Forces. The soldiers confiscated hard drives and vandalized a number of the offices. In March and April 2002, its &quot;Fieldwork section&quot; in downtown Ramallah was raided four times; soldiers searched the apartments.

<text>The GNU C Library, commonly known as glibc, is the GNU Project implementation of the C standard library. It provides a wrapper around the system calls of the Linux kernel and other kernels for application use. Despite its name, it now also directly supports C++ (and, indirectly, other programming languages). It was started in the 1980s by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU operating system.

glibc is free software released under the GNU Lesser General Public License. The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system, as well as many systems that use Linux as the kernel. These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt, login, exit and more.

==History==



The glibc project was initially written mostly by Roland McGrath, working for the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in the summer of 1987 as a teenager. In February 1988, FSF described glibc as having nearly completed the functionality required by ANSI C. By 1992, it had the ANSI C-1989 and POSIX.1-1990 functions implemented and work was under way on POSIX.2. In September 1995 Ulrich Drepper made his first contribution to the glibc and by 1997 most commits were made by him. Drepper held the maintainership position for many years and until 2012 accumulated 63% of all commits to the project.

In May 2009 glibc was migrated to a Git repository.

In 2010, a licensing issue was resolved which was caused by the Sun RPC implementation in glibc that was not GPL compatible. It was fixed by re-licensing the Sun RPC components under the BSD license.

In 2014, glibc suffered from an ABI breakage bug on s390.

In July 2017, 30 years after he started glibc, Roland McGrath announced his departure, &quot;declaring myself maintainer emeritus and withdrawing from direct involvement in the project. These past several months, if not the last few years, have proven that you don&#x27;t need me anymore&quot;.

In 2018, maintainer Raymond Nicholson removed a joke about abortion from the glibc source code. It was restored later by Alexandre Oliva after Richard Stallman demanded to have it returned.

In 2021, the copyright assignment requirement to the Free Software Foundation was removed from the project.

===Fork and variant ===
In 1994, the developers of the Linux kernel forked glibc. Their fork, &quot;Linux libc&quot;, was maintained separately until around 1998. Because the copyright attribution was insufficient, changes could not be merged back to the GNU Libc. When the FSF released glibc 2.0 in January 1997, the kernel developers discontinued Linux libc due to glibc 2.0&#x27;s superior compliance with POSIX standards. glibc 2.0 also had better internationalisation and more in-depth translation, IPv6 capability, 64-bit data access, facilities for multithreaded applications, future version compatibility, and the code was more portable. The last-used version of Linux libc used the internal name (soname) . Following on from this, glibc 2.x on Linux uses the soname 

In 2009, Debian and a number of derivatives switched from glibc to the variant eglibc. Eglibc was supported by a consortium consisting of Freescale, MIPS, MontaVista and Wind River. It contained changes that made it more suitable for embedded usage and had added support for architectures that were not supported by glibc, such as the PowerPC e500. The code of eglibc was merged back into glibc at version 2.20. Since 2014, eglibc is discontinued. The Yocto Project and Debian also moved back to glibc since the release of Debian Jessie.

===Steering committee===
Starting in 2001 the library&#x27;s development had been overseen by a committee, with Ulrich Drepper kept as the lead contributor and maintainer. The steering committee installation was surrounded by a public controversy, as it was openly described by Ulrich Drepper as a failed hostile takeover maneuver by Richard Stallman.

In March 2012, the steering committee voted to disband itself and remove Drepper in favor of a community-driven development process, with Ryan Arnold, Maxim Kuvyrkov, Joseph Myers, Carlos O&#x27;Donell, and Alexandre Oliva holding the responsibility of GNU maintainership (but no extra decision-making power).

==Functionality==
glibc provides the functionality required by the Single UNIX Specification, POSIX (1c, 1d, and 1j) and some of the functionality required by ISO C11, ISO C99, Berkeley Unix (BSD) interfaces, the System V Interface Definition (SVID) and the X/Open Portability Guide (XPG), Issue 4.2, with all extensions common to XSI (X/Open System Interface) compliant systems along with all X/Open UNIX extensions.

In addition, glibc also provides extensions that have been deemed useful or necessary while developing GNU.

===Supported hardware and kernels===
glibc is used in systems that run many different kernels and different hardware architectures. Its most common use is in systems using the Linux kernel on x86 hardware, however, officially supported hardware includes: ARM, ARC, C-SKY, DEC Alpha, IA-64, Motorola m68k, MicroBlaze, MIPS, Nios II, PA-RISC, PowerPC, RISC-V, s390, SPARC, and x86 (old versions support TILE). It officially supports the Hurd and Linux kernels. Additionally, there are heavily patched versions that run on the kernels of FreeBSD and NetBSD (from which Debian GNU/kFreeBSD and Debian GNU/NetBSD systems are built, respectively), as well as a forked-version of OpenSolaris. It is also used (in an edited form) and named in BeOS and Haiku.

===Use in small devices===
glibc has been criticized as being &quot;bloated&quot; and slower than other libraries in the past, e.g. by Linus Torvalds and embedded Linux programmers. For this reason, several alternative C standard libraries have been created which emphasize a smaller footprint. However, many small-device projects use GNU libc over the smaller alternatives because of its application support, standards compliance, and completeness. Examples include Openmoko and Familiar Linux for iPaq handhelds (when using the GPE display software).

=== Secure string functions ===
glibc does not implement bounds-checking interfaces defined in C11 and did not implement strlcpy and strlcat until 2023 on the grounds that &quot;in practice these functions can cause trouble, as their intended use encourages silent data truncation, adds complexity and inefficiency, and does not prevent all buffer overruns in the destinations.&quot; The FAQ pointed out that the bounds-checking interfaces were optional in the ISO standard and that snprintf was available as an alternative.

==Compatibility layers==
There are compatibility layers (&quot;shims&quot;) to allow programs written for other ecosystems to run on glibc interface offering systems. These include libhybris, a compatibility layer for Android&#x27;s Bionic, and Wine, which can be seen as a compatibility layer from Windows APIs to glibc and other native APIs available on Unix-like systems.

<doc id="324365" wikidata="Q5436560" url="?curid=324365" title="Faryadi Sarwar Zardad">
<text>Faryadi Sarwar Zardad (also known as Zardad Khan and Commander Zardad; born 1963) is an Afghan former warlord and mujahideen leader. In 2005, he was convicted in the United Kingdom (where he was living), for conspiring to take hostages and conspiring to torture during the 1990s in Afghanistan.

==Early life and war crimes==
Faryadi Sarwar Zardad is Pashtun and was born circa 1963 in Afghanistan. He is a former Mujahideen leader who fought during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He ran a Sarobi checkpoint, blocking the major route heading from Jalalabad into Kabul, that commonly robbed, abducted and killed travellers between 31 December 1991 to 30 September 1996.
A widely publicised allegation regarding Zardad was that one of his militiamen, Abdullah Shah, viciously bit prisoners and had even eaten at least one victim&#x27;s testicles.

Shah was described as a &quot;human dog&quot; and kept in a cave with a chain around his neck by Zardad, and brought out to intimidate captured travellers. Shah was reportedly executed by the Afghan government in April 2004.

In 1998, Zardad fled to Britain using a false passport to avoid persecution under the ruling Taliban, and requested asylum. He was the subject of an exposé on a BBC television programme, &quot;Newsnight&quot;, first broadcast on 26 July 2000.
Zardad&#x27;s presence in London had been discussed with a BBC reporter, John Simpson, by the Taliban&#x27;s Foreign Minister in Kabul, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, during an interview in 1999.

The minister had retorted to a question that &quot;Well, you British are sheltering the criminal Commander Zardad&quot;. The BBC eventually tracked Zardad down after nearly a year, and found him living in Mitcham, London.
He was interviewed by Simpson for the programme, in which Zardad claimed to have been based in Kabul and had only visited Sarobi as an adviser to the local commanders.
After the BBC report, Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) launched an international campaign
urging the British government to prosecute Zardad. They issued a statement in many languages and circulated it through the Internet.

RAWA also issued a report entitled &quot;Some reports of crimes committed by Zardad in Afghanistan&quot;, which were used in his prosecution.

Zardad was briefly arrested on 10 May 2003 by officers of the Scotland Yard&#x27;s anti-terrorist branch and bailed only to be re-arrested on 14 July 2003, by which time he was living in Streatham had been running a pizza parlour in Bexleyheath for three years.

==The trials==

===The first trial===
The day following his arrest he was charged with 16 offenses relating to his time as a military commander during the Afghan civil war in the early 1990s. There were nine counts under §134 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 that, as a military commander in the Sarobi region of Afghanistan, he tortured or gave orders to carry out torture as part of his official duties; five counts under §1(1) of the Taking of Hostages Act 1982 that he detained hostages and held them to ransom, and two charges, under §1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977, that he had conspired to carry out or order torture and hostage-taking.

Although the alleged crimes had taken place outside of the United Kingdom, the Law Lords had ruled in March 1999 when examining the case against General Augusto Pinochet that torture is a crime of universal jurisdiction and thus could be prosecuted within the United Kingdom; and indeed the UK was obliged under the United Nations Convention Against Torture to either extradite or prosecute someone facing plausible accusations of torture. Hostage taking is similarly a crime of universal jurisdiction under the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages.
The trial took place in October 2004, with Zardad pleading not guilty to all of the charges.

During the trial, the prosecutor, Lord Goldsmith, stated that he believed that this was the first time in which someone had been prosecuted in one jurisdiction for alleged offences committed in the other.
One witness testified that he was stopped at a checkpoint by men with covered faces and sunglasses tied to a nearby metal chair where he was interrogated and tortured. Another, a lorry driver, claimed to have been kept prisoner for six months until a ransom was paid by the driver&#x27;s brother. Zardad also denied having previously admitted to the British police that he attended a 15-day training camp where he had learned to use AK-47s, rocket launchers and other weapons. However, the jury was unable to come to a verdict.

===The second trial===
Zardad was retried in 2005, with charges of conspiracy to torture, and conspiracy to take hostages, both contrary to the 1977 Criminal Law Act. Evidence was taken from 16 witnesses via a video link to the British Embassy in Kabul. As in the first trial, a court order prevented the identities of many of the victims and witnesses from being revealed for fear of retaliation.

The trial included evidence of:
* Summary executions and hostage taking
* The killing of 10 or 11 men in a minibus; their families screaming at the roadside
* An elderly man whipped and locked in a metal cupboard
* A man having petrol poured over him whilst Saleh&#x27;s militia joked about setting fire to it.
* A small boy witnessing his father&#x27;s ear being cut off.

===The outcome===
The jury in the second trial found him guilty on 18 July 2005, and he was sentenced 20 years in prison – receiving 20 years for each of the two charges to be served concurrently. The judge, Mr Justice Colman Treacy, QC, recommended that Zardad be deported upon release. It was reported in December 2016 that he had been so deported.

A video, &quot;Zardad&#x27;s Dog&quot;, of parts of the 2002 Kabul trial of Abdullah Shah, was withdrawn from the October 2004 Turner Prize exhibition at the Tate Gallery just before the first trial started, to avoid potential contempt of court prosecution. It was not publicly displayed until 3 October 2005.

<doc id="324375" wikidata="Q1410440" url="?curid=324375" title="Parameter (computer programming)">
<text>In computer programming, a parameter or a formal argument is a special kind of variable used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are the values of the arguments (often called &quot;actual arguments&quot; or &quot;actual parameters&quot;) with which the subroutine is going to be called/invoked. An ordered list of parameters is usually included in the definition of a subroutine, so that, each time the subroutine is called, its arguments for that call are evaluated, and the resulting values can be assigned to the corresponding parameters.

Unlike &quot;argument&quot; in usual mathematical usage, the &quot;argument&quot; in computer science is the actual input expression passed/supplied to a function, procedure, or routine in the invocation/call statement, whereas the &quot;parameter&quot; is the variable inside the implementation of the subroutine. For example, if one defines the codice_1 subroutine as codice_2, then codice_3 are parameters, while if this is called as codice_4, then codice_5 are the arguments. Variables (and expressions thereof) from the calling context can be arguments: if the subroutine is called as codice_6 then the &quot;variables&quot; codice_7 are the arguments, not the &quot;values&quot; codice_5. See the Parameters and arguments section for more information.

The semantics for how parameters can be declared and how the (value of) arguments are passed to the parameters of subroutines are defined by the evaluation strategy of the language, and the details of how this is represented in any particular computer system depend on the calling convention of that system. In the most common case, call by value, a parameter acts within the subroutine as a new local variable initialized to the value of the argument (a local (isolated) copy of the argument if the argument is a variable), but in other cases, e.g. call by reference, the argument variable supplied by the caller can be affected by actions within the called subroutine.

==Example==
The following program in the C programming language defines a function that is named &quot;SalesTax&quot; and has one parameter named &quot;price&quot;. The type of price is &quot;double&quot; (i.e. a double-precision floating point number). The function&#x27;s return type is also a double.

double SalesTax(double price)
 return 0.05 * price;


After the function has been defined, it can be invoked as follows:

SalesTax(10.00);
In this example, the function has been invoked with the &quot;argument&quot; 10.00. When this happens, 10.00 will be assigned to price, and the function begins calculating its result. The steps for producing the result are specified below, enclosed in {}. codice_9 indicates that the first thing to do is multiply 0.05 by the value of price, which gives 0.50. codice_10 means the function will produce the result of codice_9. Therefore, the final result (ignoring possible round-off errors one encounters with representing decimal fractions as binary fractions) is 0.50.

== Parameters and arguments ==
The terms &quot;parameter&quot; and &quot;argument&quot; may have different meanings in different programming languages. Sometimes they are used interchangeably, and the context is used to distinguish the meaning. The term &quot;parameter&quot; (sometimes called &quot;formal parameter&quot;) is often used to refer to the variable as found in the function declaration, while &quot;argument&quot; (sometimes called &quot;actual parameter&quot;) refers to the actual input supplied at a function call statement. For example, if one defines a function as codice_12, then codice_13 is the parameter, and if it is called by codice_14 then codice_15 is the argument. A parameter is an (unbound) variable, while the argument can be a literal or variable or more complex expression involving literals and variables. In case of call by value, what is passed to the function is the value of the argument – for example, codice_16 and codice_17 are equivalent calls – while in call by reference, with a variable as argument, what is passed is a reference to that variable - even though the syntax for the function call could stay the same. The specification for pass-by-reference or pass-by-value would be made in the function declaration and/or definition.

Parameters appear in procedure definitions; arguments appear in procedure calls. In the function definition codice_18 the variable x is a parameter; in the function call codice_16 the value 2 is the argument of the function. Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.

A parameter is an intrinsic property of the procedure, included in its definition. For example, in many languages, a procedure to add two supplied integers together and calculate the sum would need two parameters, one for each integer. In general, a procedure may be defined with any number of parameters, or no parameters at all. If a procedure has parameters, the part of its definition that specifies the parameters is called its &quot;parameter list&quot;.

By contrast, the arguments are the expressions supplied to the procedure when it is called, usually one expression matching one of the parameters. Unlike the parameters, which form an unchanging part of the procedure&#x27;s definition, the arguments may vary from call to call. Each time a procedure is called, the part of the procedure call that specifies the arguments is called the &quot;argument list&quot;.

Although parameters are also commonly referred to as arguments, arguments are sometimes thought of as the actual values or references assigned to the parameter variables when the subroutine is called at run-time. When discussing code that is calling into a subroutine, any values or references passed into the subroutine are the arguments, and the place in the code where these values or references are given is the &quot;parameter list&quot;. When discussing the code inside the subroutine definition, the variables in the subroutine&#x27;s parameter list are the parameters, while the values of the parameters at runtime are the arguments. For example, in C, when dealing with threads it is common to pass in an argument of type void* and cast it to an expected type:

void ThreadFunction(void* pThreadArgument)
 // Naming the first parameter &#x27;pThreadArgument&#x27; is correct, rather than
 // &#x27;pThreadParameter&#x27;. At run time the value we use is an argument. As
 // mentioned above, reserve the term parameter for when discussing
 // subroutine definitions.


To better understand the difference, consider the following function written in C:

int Sum(int addend1, int addend2)
 return addend1 + addend2;


The function &quot;Sum&quot; has two parameters, named &quot;addend1&quot; and &quot;addend2&quot;. It adds the values passed into the parameters, and returns the result to the subroutine&#x27;s caller (using a technique automatically supplied by the C compiler).

The code which calls the &quot;Sum&quot; function might look like this:

int value1 = 40;
int value2 = 2;
int sum_value = Sum(value1, value2);

The variables &quot;value1&quot; and &quot;value2&quot; are initialized with values. &quot;value1&quot; and &quot;value2&quot; are both arguments to the &quot;sum&quot; function in this context.

At runtime, the values assigned to these variables are passed to the function &quot;Sum&quot; as arguments. In the &quot;Sum&quot; function, the parameters &quot;addend1&quot; and &quot;addend2&quot; are evaluated, yielding the arguments 40 and 2, respectively. The values of the arguments are added, and the result is returned to the caller, where it is assigned to the variable &quot;sum_value&quot;.

Because of the difference between parameters and arguments, it is possible to supply inappropriate arguments to a procedure. The call may supply too many or too few arguments; one or more of the arguments may be a wrong type; or arguments may be supplied in the wrong order. Any of these situations causes a mismatch between the parameter and argument lists, and the procedure will often return an unintended answer or generate a runtime error.

===Alternative convention in Eiffel===
Within the Eiffel software development method and language, the terms &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;parameter&quot; have distinct uses established by convention. The term &quot;argument&quot; is used exclusively in reference to a routine&#x27;s inputs, and the term &quot;parameter&quot; is used exclusively in type parameterization for generic classes.

Consider the following routine definition:
 sum (addend1: INTEGER; addend2: INTEGER): INTEGER
 do
 Result := addend1 + addend2
 end
The routine codice_20 takes two arguments codice_21 and codice_22, which are called the routine&#x27;s formal arguments. A call to codice_20 specifies actual arguments, as shown below with codice_24 and codice_25.
 sum_value: INTEGER
 value1: INTEGER = 40
 value2: INTEGER = 2
 sum_value := sum (value1, value2) 
Parameters are also thought of as either formal or actual. Formal generic parameters are used in the definition of generic classes. In the example below, the class codice_26 is declared as a generic class which has two formal generic parameters, codice_27 representing data of interest and codice_28 representing the hash key for the data:
class HASH_TABLE [G, K -&gt; HASHABLE] 


When a class becomes a client to codice_26, the formal generic parameters are substituted with actual generic parameters in a generic derivation. In the following attribute declaration, codice_30 is to be used as a character string based dictionary. As such, both data and key formal generic parameters are substituted with actual generic parameters of type codice_31.
 my_dictionary: HASH_TABLE [STRING, STRING] 
== Datatypes ==
In strongly typed programming languages, each parameter&#x27;s type must be specified in the procedure declaration. Languages using type inference attempt to discover the types automatically from the function&#x27;s body and usage. Dynamically typed programming languages defer type resolution until run-time. Weakly typed languages perform little to no type resolution, relying instead on the programmer for correctness.

Some languages use a special keyword (e.g. &quot;void&quot;) to indicate that the subroutine has no parameters; in formal type theory, such functions take an empty parameter list (whose type is not &quot;void&quot;, but rather &quot;unit&quot;).

== Argument passing ==
The exact mechanism for assigning arguments to parameters, called &quot;argument passing&quot;, depends upon the evaluation strategy used for that parameter (typically call by value), which may be specified using keywords.

=== Default arguments ===
Some programming languages such as Ada, C++, Clojure, Common Lisp, Fortran 90, Python, Ruby, Tcl, and Windows PowerShell allow for a default argument to be explicitly or implicitly given in a subroutine&#x27;s declaration. This allows the caller to omit that argument when calling the subroutine. If the default argument is explicitly given, then that value is used if it is not provided by the caller. If the default argument is implicit (sometimes by using a keyword such as &quot;Optional&quot;) then the language provides a well-known value (such as &quot;null&quot;, &quot;Empty&quot;, zero, an empty string, etc.) if a value is not provided by the caller.

PowerShell example:

function doc($g = 1.21) {
 &quot;$g gigawatts? $g gigawatts? Great Scott!&quot;


PS &gt; doc
1.21 gigawatts? 1.21 gigawatts? Great Scott!

PS &gt; doc 88
88 gigawatts? 88 gigawatts? Great Scott!

Default arguments can be seen as a special case of the variable-length argument list.

=== Variable-length parameter lists ===
Some languages allow subroutines to be defined to accept a variable number of arguments. For such languages, the subroutines must iterate through the list of arguments.

PowerShell example:

function marty {
 $args | foreach { &quot;back to the year $_&quot; }


PS &gt; marty 1985
back to the year 1985

PS &gt; marty 2015 1985 1955
back to the year 2015
back to the year 1985
back to the year 1955
=== Named parameters ===
Some programming languages—such as Ada and Windows PowerShell—allow subroutines to have named parameters. This allows the calling code to be more self-documenting. It also provides more flexibility to the caller, often allowing the order of the arguments to be changed, or for arguments to be omitted as needed.

PowerShell example:

function jennifer($adjectiveYoung, $adjectiveOld) {
 &quot;Young Jennifer: I&#x27;m $adjectiveYoung!&quot;
 &quot;Old Jennifer: I&#x27;m $adjectiveOld!&quot;

PS &gt; jennifer &#x27;fresh&#x27; &#x27;experienced&#x27;
Young Jennifer: I&#x27;m fresh!
Old Jennifer: I&#x27;m experienced!

PS &gt; jennifer -adjectiveOld &#x27;experienced&#x27; -adjectiveYoung &#x27;fresh&#x27;
Young Jennifer: I&#x27;m fresh!
Old Jennifer: I&#x27;m experienced!
=== Multiple parameters in functional languages===
In lambda calculus, each function has exactly one parameter. What is thought of as functions with multiple parameters is usually represented in lambda calculus as a function which takes the first argument, and returns a function which takes the rest of the arguments; this is a transformation known as currying. Some programming languages, like ML and Haskell, follow this scheme. In these languages, every function has exactly one parameter, and what may look like the definition of a function of multiple parameters, is actually syntactic sugar for the definition of a function that returns a function, etc. Function application is left-associative in these languages as well as in lambda calculus, so what looks like an application of a function to multiple arguments is correctly evaluated as the function applied to the first argument, then the resulting function applied to the second argument, etc.

==Output parameters==
An output parameter, also known as an out parameter or return parameter, is a parameter used for output, rather than the more usual use for input. Using call by reference parameters, or call by value parameters where the value is a reference, as output parameters is an idiom in some languages, notably C and C++, while other languages have built-in support for output parameters. Languages with built-in support for output parameters include Ada (see ), Fortran (since Fortran 90; see ), various procedural extensions to SQL, such as PL/SQL (see PL/SQL functions) and Transact-SQL, C# and the .NET Framework, Swift, and the scripting language TScript (see TScript function declarations).

More precisely, one may distinguish three types of parameters or parameter modes: &quot;s&quot;, &quot;output parameters,&quot; and &quot;s;&quot; these are often denoted codice_32, codice_33, and codice_34 or codice_35. An input argument (the argument to an input parameter) must be a value, such as an initialized variable or literal, and must not be redefined or assigned to; an output argument must be an assignable variable, but it need not be initialized, any existing value is not accessible, and must be assigned a value; and an input/output argument must be an initialized, assignable variable, and can optionally be assigned a value. The exact requirements and enforcement vary between languages – for example, in Ada 83 output parameters can only be assigned to, not read, even after assignment (this was removed in Ada 95 to remove the need for an auxiliary accumulator variable). These are analogous to the notion of a value in an expression being an r-value (has a value), an l-value (can be assigned), or an r-value/l-value (has a value and can be assigned), respectively, though these terms have specialized meanings in C.

In some cases only input and input/output are distinguished, with output being considered a specific use of input/output, and in other cases only input and output (but not input/output) are supported. The default mode varies between languages: in Fortran 90 input/output is default, while in C# and SQL extensions input is default, and in TScript each parameter is explicitly specified as input or output.

Syntactically, parameter mode is generally indicated with a keyword in the function declaration, such as codice_36 in C#. Conventionally output parameters are often put at the end of the parameter list to clearly distinguish them, though this is not always followed. TScript uses a different approach, where in the function declaration input parameters are listed, then output parameters, separated by a colon (:) and there is no return type to the function itself, as in this function, which computes the size of a text fragment:

TextExtent(WString text, Font font : Integer width, Integer height)
Parameter modes are a form of denotational semantics, stating the programmer&#x27;s intent and allowing compilers to catch errors and apply optimizations – they do not necessarily imply operational semantics (how the parameter passing actually occurs). Notably, while input parameters can be implemented by call by value, and output and input/output parameters by call by reference – and this is a straightforward way to implement these modes in languages without built-in support – this is not always how they are implemented. This distinction is discussed in detail in the &quot;Ada &#x27;83 Rationale,&quot; which emphasizes that the parameter mode is abstracted from which parameter passing mechanism (by reference or by copy) is actually implemented. For instance, while in C# input parameters (default, no keyword) are passed by value, and output and input/output parameters (codice_33 and codice_38) are passed by reference, in PL/SQL input parameters (codice_39) are passed by reference, and output and input/output parameters (codice_40 and codice_41) are by default passed by value and the result copied back, but can be passed by reference by using the codice_42 compiler hint.

A syntactically similar construction to output parameters is to assign the return value to a variable with the same name as the function. This is found in Pascal and Fortran 66 and Fortran 77, as in this Pascal example:

function f(x, y: integer): integer;
begin
 f := x + y;
end;

This is semantically different in that when called, the function is simply evaluated – it is not passed a variable from the calling scope to store the output in.

===Use===
The primary use of output parameters is to return multiple values from a function, while the use of input/output parameters is to modify state using parameter passing (rather than by shared environment, as in global variables). An important use of returning multiple values is to solve the semipredicate problem of returning both a value and an error status – see Semipredicate problem: Multivalued return.

For example, to return two variables from a function in C, one may write:

int width
int height;

F(x, &amp;width, &amp;height);

where codice_13 is an input parameter and codice_44 and codice_45 are output parameters.

A common use case in C and related languages is for exception handling, where a function places the return value in an output variable, and returns a Boolean corresponding to whether the function succeeded or not. An archetypal example is the codice_46 method in .NET, especially C#, which parses a string into an integer, returning codice_47 on success and codice_48 on failure. This has the following signature:

public static bool TryParse(string s, out int result)

and may be used as follows:

int result;
if (!Int32.TryParse(s, result)) {
 // exception handling

Similar considerations apply to returning a value of one of several possible types, where the return value can specify the type and then value is stored in one of several output variables.

===Drawbacks===
Output parameters are often discouraged in modern programming, essentially as being awkward, confusing, and too low-level – commonplace return values are considerably easier to understand and work with. Notably, output parameters involve functions with side effects (modifying the output parameter) and are semantically similar to references, which are more confusing than pure functions and values, and the distinction between output parameters and input/output parameters can be subtle. Further, since in common programming styles most parameters are simply input parameters, output parameters and input/output parameters are unusual and hence susceptible to misunderstanding.

Output and input/output parameters prevent function composition, since the output is stored in variables, rather than in the value of an expression. Thus one must initially declare a variable, and then each step of a chain of functions must be a separate statement. For example, in C++ the following function composition:

Object obj = G(y, F(x));

when written with output and input/output parameters instead becomes (for codice_49 it is an output parameter, for codice_27 an input/output parameter):

Object obj;
F(x, &amp;obj);
G(y, &amp;obj);

In the special case of a function with a single output or input/output parameter and no return value, function composition is possible if the output or input/output parameter (or in C/C++, its address) is also returned by the function, in which case the above becomes:

Object obj;
G(y, F(x, &amp;obj));
===Alternatives===
There are various alternatives to the use cases of output parameters.

For returning multiple values from a function, an alternative is to return a tuple. Syntactically this is clearer if automatic sequence unpacking and parallel assignment can be used, as in Go or Python, such as:

def f():
 return 1, 2
a, b = f()
For returning a value of one of several types, a tagged union can be used instead; the most common cases are nullable types (option types), where the return value can be null to indicate failure. For exception handling, one can return a nullable type, or raise an exception. For example, in Python one might have either:

result = parse(s)
if result is None:
 # exception handling

or, more idiomatically:

try:
 result = parse(s)
except ParseError:
 # exception handling
The micro-optimization of not requiring a local variable and copying the return when using output variables can also be applied to conventional functions and return values by sufficiently sophisticated compilers.

The usual alternative to output parameters in C and related languages is to return a single data structure containing all return values. For example, given a structure encapsulating width and height, one can write:

WidthHeight width_and_height = F(x);
In object-oriented languages, instead of using input/output parameters, one can often use call by sharing, passing a reference to an object and then mutating the object, though not changing which object the variable refers to.

<text>Wilhelm Waiblinger (; 21 November 1804 – 17 or 30 January 1830) was a German romantic poet, mostly remembered today in connection with Friedrich Hölderlin. After he had attended Gymnasium Illustre in Stuttgart, he was a student at the seminary of Tübingen in the 1820s, when Hölderlin, already mentally ill, lived there as a recluse in a carpenter&#x27;s house. Waiblinger, who used to visit the older poet and take him out for walks, left an account of Hölderlin&#x27;s life then, &quot;Hölderlins Leben, Dichtung und Wahnsinn&quot; (&quot;Hölderlin&#x27;s life, poetry and madness&quot;). In the late 1820s, Waiblinger left Tübingen for Italy, dying at the age of 25 in Rome, where he is buried in the Protestant Cemetery.

In his short story &quot;Im Presselschen Gartenhaus&quot; (&quot;In Pressel’s Garden-house&quot;, 1913), Hermann Hesse gives a touching picture of a visit to Hölderlin by Waiblinger and the poet Eduard Mörike, both young theology students in Tübingen, like Hölderlin himself decades before.

<text>Eduard Friedrich Mörike (; 8 September 18044 June 1875) was a German Lutheran pastor who was also a Romantic poet and writer of novellas and novels. Many of his poems were set to music and became established folk songs, while others were used by composers Hugo Wolf and Ignaz Lachner in their symphonic works.

==Biography==
Mörike was born in Ludwigsburg. His father was Karl Friedrich Mörike (died 1817), a district medical councilor; his mother was Charlotte Bayer. After the death of his father, in 1817, he went to live with his uncle Eberhard Friedrich Georgii in Stuttgart, who intended his nephew to become a clergyman. Therefore, after one year at the Stuttgart &quot;Gymnasium illustre&quot;, Mörike joined the Evangelical Seminary Urach, a humanist grammar school, in 1818 and from 1822 to 1826 attended the Tübinger Stift. There, he scored low grades and failed the admission test to Urach Seminary, yet was accepted anyhow. At the Seminary he went on to study the classics, something that was to become a major influence on his writing, and he made the acquaintance of Wilhelm Hartlaub and Wilhelm Waiblinger. Afterwards he studied theology at the Seminary of Tübingen where he met Ludwig Bauer, David Friedrich Strauss and Friedrich Theodor Vischer. Many of these friendships were long-lasting. In Tübingen, with Bauer, he invented the fairyland &quot;Orplid&quot; – see the poem &quot;Song Weylas (You are Orplid)&quot; dating from 1831.

Mörike became a Lutheran pastor and, in 1834, he was appointed vicar of Cleversulzbach near Weinsberg. In the Autumn of 1843 he stayed for over half a year with his friend Pastor Wilhelm Hartlaub (1804–1885) in the village of , situated in the state of Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. During this time he produced a drawing of the Wermutshausen Petruskirche, dating from the early 1800s. This drawing is speculated, due to the perspective, to be from a top-floor room of a local brewery, distillery, and guesthouse at the edge of town, which remains in operation today as Gasthaus und Manufaktur Krone Wermutshausen. In town there is also a Museum commemorating this visit, in which guests can see the room in which Mörike lived. For reasons of health, Mörike retired quite early, and in 1851 became professor of German literature at the Katharinenstift in Stuttgart. This office he held until he retired in 1866. He continued to live in Stuttgart until his death.

==Works==
Mörike was a member of the so-called Swabian school of writers around Ludwig Uhland. His poems (&quot;Gedichte&quot;, 1838), are mostly lyrical, yet often humorous and written in simple and seemingly everyday German. His ballad &quot;Schön Rotraut&quot; – opening with the line &quot;Wie heisst König Ringangs Töchterlein?&quot; – became a popular favorite.

His first published work was the novel &quot;Maler Nolten&quot; (&quot;The painter Nolten&quot;, 1832), a tale about the life of a painter, and which revealed his imaginative power; it became fairly popular. The novella &quot;Mozart auf der Reise nach Prag&quot; (&quot;Mozart on the way to Prague&quot;, 1856) was a humorous examination of the problems of artists in a world uncongenial to art. It is frequently cited as his finest achievement. He also wrote a somewhat fantastic &quot;Idylle vom Bodensee, oder Fischer Martin und die Glockendiebe&quot; (1846), the fairy tale &quot;Das Stuttgarter Hutzelmännlein&quot; (1855), and published a collection of hymns, odes, elegies, and idylls of the Greeks and Romans, entitled &quot;Klassische Blumenlese&quot; (1840). He also translated Anacreon and Theocritus into German.

Mörike&#x27;s &quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; (&quot;Collected Writings&quot;) were first published posthumously in 1878 (4 vols.). Later editions are those edited by R. Krauss (6 vols., 1905), and the &quot;Volksausgabe&quot; (&quot;Popular edition&quot;), published by Göschen (4 vols., 1905). Selections from his literary estate were published by R. Krauss in &quot;Eduard Mörike als Gelegenheitsdichter&quot; (1895), and his correspondence with Hermann Kurz, Moritz von Schwind, and Theodor Storm, by J. Bachtold (1885–1891); an edition of Mörike&#x27;s &quot;Ausgewählte Briefe&quot; (&quot;Selected letters&quot;), in 2 vols., appeared 1903–1904.
His work was greatly praised by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein who recommended him to Bertrand Russell as really a &quot;great&quot; poet and his poems are among the best things we have...the beauty of Mörike&#x27;s work is very closely related to Goethe&#x27;s.

===Musical settings===
Many of his lyrics were set to music by Hugo Wolf, Ludwig Hetsch, Didia Saint Georges, Elise Schmezer, Julie Waldburg-Wurzach, Pauline Volkstein, and Fritz Kauffmann. Ignaz Lachner set to music his opera &quot;Die Regenbrüder&quot;. Hugo Distler composed 48 settings of Mörike&#x27;s poetry in his &quot;Mörike-Chorliederbuch.&quot; Many of his poems became established folksongs. Wilhelm Killmayer set several of his poems in his song cycle &quot;&quot; in 2003.

===As an artist===

Mörike was also known to produce drawings in his time, though it is not the subject of much discussion. While staying in the town of Wermutshausen in the Autumn of 1843, Mörike produced a drawing of the Petruskirche, a small church built in the early 1800s.

<text>The C standard library, sometimes referred to as libc, is the standard library for the C programming language, as specified in the ISO C standard. Starting from the original ANSI C standard, it was developed at the same time as the C POSIX library, which is a superset of it. Since ANSI C was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, the C standard library is also called the ISO C library.

The C standard library provides macros, type definitions and functions for tasks such as string manipulation, mathematical computation, input/output processing, memory management, and input/output.

== Application programming interface (API) ==

=== Header files ===

The application programming interface (API) of the C standard library is declared in a number of header files. Each header file contains one or more function declarations, data type definitions, and macros.

After a long period of stability, three new header files (codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3) were added with &quot;Normative Addendum 1&quot; (NA1), an addition to the C Standard ratified in 1995. Six more header files (codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, and codice_9) were added with C99, a revision to the C Standard published in 1999, five more files (codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, and codice_14) with C11 in 2011 and one more file (codice_15) with C23 in 2023. In total, there are now 30 header files:

Three of the header files (codice_4, codice_11, and codice_13) are conditional features that implementations are not required to support.

The POSIX standard added several nonstandard C headers for Unix-specific functionality. Many have found their way to other architectures. Examples include codice_19 and codice_20. A number of other groups are using other nonstandard headers – the GNU C Library has codice_21, and OpenVMS has the codice_22 function.

=== Documentation ===
On Unix-like systems, the authoritative documentation of the API is provided in the form of man pages. On most systems, man pages on standard library functions are in section 3; section 7 may contain some more generic pages on underlying concepts (e.g. codice_23 in Linux).

== Implementations ==
Unix-like systems typically have a C library in shared library form, but the header files (and compiler toolchain) may be absent from an installation so C development may not be possible. The C library is considered part of the operating system on Unix-like systems; in addition to functions specified by the C standard, it includes other functions that are part of the operating system API, such as functions specified in the POSIX standard. The C library functions, including the ISO C standard ones, are widely used by programs, and are regarded as if they were not only an implementation of something in the C language, but also &quot;de facto&quot; part of the operating system interface. Unix-like operating systems generally cannot function if the C library is erased. This is true for applications which are dynamically as opposed to statically linked. Further, the kernel itself (at least in the case of Linux) operates independently of any libraries.

On Microsoft Windows, the core system dynamic libraries (DLLs) provide an implementation of the C standard library for the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler v6.0; the C standard library for newer versions of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is provided by each compiler individually, as well as &quot;redistributable&quot; packages. Compiled applications written in C are either statically linked with a C library, or linked to a dynamic version of the library that is shipped with these applications, rather than relied upon to be present on the targeted systems. Functions in a compiler&#x27;s C library are not regarded as interfaces to Microsoft Windows.

Many C library implementations exist, provided with both various operating systems and C compilers. Some of the popular implementations are the following:

* The BSD libc, various implementations distributed with BSD-derived operating systems
* GNU C Library (glibc), used in GNU Hurd, GNU/kFreeBSD, and most Linux distributions
* Microsoft C run-time library, part of Microsoft Visual C++. There are two versions of the library: MSVCRT that was a redistributable till v12 / Visual Studio 2013 with low C99 compliance, and a new one UCRT (Universal C Run Time) that is part of Windows 10 and 11, so always present to link against, and is C99 compliant too .
* dietlibc, an alternative small implementation of the C standard library (MMU-less)
* μClibc, a C standard library for embedded μClinux systems (MMU-less)
** uclibc-ng, an embedded C library, fork of μClibc, still maintained, with memory management unit (MMU) support
* Newlib, a C standard library for embedded systems (MMU-less) and used in the Cygwin GNU distribution for Windows
* klibc, primarily for booting Linux systems
* musl, another lightweight C standard library implementation for Linux systems
* Bionic, originally developed by Google for the Android embedded system operating system, derived from BSD libc
* picolibc, developed by Keith Packard, targeting small embedded systems with limited RAM, based on code from Newlib and AVR Libc

=== Compiler built-in functions ===
Some compilers (for example, GCC) provide built-in versions of many of the functions in the C standard library; that is, the implementations of the functions are written into the compiled object file, and the program calls the built-in versions instead of the functions in the C library shared object file. This reduces function-call overhead, especially if function calls are replaced with inline variants, and allows other forms of optimization (as the compiler knows the control-flow characteristics of the built-in variants), but may cause confusion when debugging (for example, the built-in versions cannot be replaced with instrumented variants).

However, the built-in functions must behave like ordinary functions in accordance with ISO C. The main implication is that the program must be able to create a pointer to these functions by taking their address, and invoke the function by means of that pointer. If two pointers to the same function are derived in two different translation units in the program, these two pointers must compare equal; that is, the address comes by resolving the name of the function, which has external (program-wide) linkage.

=== Linking, libm ===

Under FreeBSD and glibc, some functions such as sin() are not linked in by default and are instead bundled in the mathematical library libm. If any of them are used, the linker must be given the directive codice_24. POSIX requires that the c99 compiler supports codice_24, and that the functions declared in the headers codice_26, codice_4, and codice_5 are available for linking if codice_24 is specified, but does not specify if the functions are linked by default. musl satisfies this requirement by putting everything into a single libc library and providing an empty libm.

=== Detection ===
According to the C standard the macro codice_30 shall be defined to 1 if the implementation is hosted. A hosted implementation has all the headers specified by the C standard. An implementation can also be &quot;freestanding&quot; which means that these headers will not be present. If an implementation is &quot;freestanding&quot;, it shall define codice_30 to 0.

== Problems and workarounds ==

=== Buffer overflow vulnerabilities ===
Some functions in the C standard library have been notorious for having buffer overflow vulnerabilities and generally encouraging buggy programming ever since their adoption. The most criticized items are:
* string-manipulation routines, including codice_32 and codice_33, for lack of bounds checking and possible buffer overflows if the bounds are not checked manually;
* string routines in general, for side-effects, encouraging irresponsible buffer usage, not always guaranteeing valid null-terminated output, linear length calculation;
* codice_34 family of routines, for spoiling the execution stack when the format string does not match the arguments given. This fundamental flaw created an entire class of attacks: format string attacks;
* codice_35 and codice_36 family of I/O routines, for lack of (either any or easy) input length checking.

Except the extreme case with codice_37, all the security vulnerabilities can be avoided by introducing auxiliary code to perform memory management, bounds checking, input checking, etc. This is often done in the form of wrappers that make standard library functions safer and easier to use. This dates back to as early as &quot;The Practice of Programming&quot; book by B. Kernighan and R. Pike where the authors commonly use wrappers that print error messages and quit the program if an error occurs.

The ISO C committee published Technical reports TR 24731-1 and is working on TR 24731-2 to propose adoption of some functions with bounds checking and automatic buffer allocation, correspondingly. The former has met severe criticism with some praise, and the latter saw mixed response.

Despite concerns, TR 24731-1 was integrated into the C standards track in ISO/IEC 9899:2011 (C11), Annex K (&quot;Bounds-checking interfaces&quot;), and implemented approximately in Microsoft’s C/++ runtime (CRT) library for the Win32 and Win64 platforms.

(By default, Microsoft Visual Studio’s C and C++ compilers issue warnings when using older, &quot;insecure&quot; functions. However, Microsoft’s implementation of TR 24731-1 is subtly incompatible with both TR 24731-1 and Annex K, so it’s common for portable projects to disable or ignore these warnings. They can be disabled directly by issuing #pragma warning(disable : 4996) before/around the call site[s] in question, or indirectly by issuing #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS 1
before including any headers. Command-line option codice_38 should have the same effect as this codice_39.)

=== Threading problems, vulnerability to race conditions ===
The codice_40 routine is criticized for being thread unsafe and otherwise vulnerable to race conditions.

=== Error handling ===
The error handling of the functions in the C standard library is not consistent and sometimes confusing. According to the Linux manual page codice_41, &quot;The current (version 2.8) situation under glibc is messy. Most (but not all) functions raise exceptions on errors. Some also set &quot;errno&quot;. A few functions set &quot;errno&quot;, but do not raise an exception. A very few functions do neither.&quot;

== Standardization ==
The original C language provided no built-in functions such as I/O operations, unlike traditional languages such as COBOL and Fortran. Over time, user communities of C shared ideas and implementations of what is now called C standard libraries. Many of these ideas were incorporated eventually into the definition of the standardized C language.

Both Unix and C were created at AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During the 1970s the C language became increasingly popular. Many universities and organizations began creating their own variants of the language for their own projects. By the beginning of the 1980s compatibility problems between the various C implementations became apparent. In 1983 the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to establish a standard specification of C known as &quot;ANSI C&quot;. This work culminated in the creation of the so-called C89 standard in 1989. Part of the resulting standard was a set of software libraries called the ANSI C standard library.

=== POSIX standard library ===
POSIX, as well as SUS, specify a number of routines that should be available over and above those in the basic C standard library. The POSIX specification includes header files for, among other uses, multi-threading, networking, and regular expressions. These are often implemented alongside the C standard library functionality, with varying degrees of closeness. For example, glibc implements functions such as codice_42 within codice_43, but before NPTL was merged into glibc it constituted a separate library with its own linker flag argument. Often, this POSIX-specified functionality will be regarded as part of the library; the basic C library may be identified as the ANSI or ISO C library.

=== BSD libc ===
BSD libc is a superset of the POSIX standard library supported by the C libraries included with BSD operating systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and macOS. BSD libc has some extensions that are not defined in the original standard, many of which first appeared in 1994&#x27;s 4.4BSD release (the first to be largely developed after the first standard was issued in 1989). Some of the extensions of BSD libc are:

* codice_44 contains an implementation of red–black tree and splay tree
* codice_45 implementations of Linked list, queues, tail queue, etc.
* codice_46 defined in codice_47. This can be used to read a file line by line.
* codice_48 contains some functions to traverse a file hierarchy
* codice_49 some functions to connect to the Berkeley DB
* codice_50 and codice_51 secure alternatives for codice_52 and codice_53
* codice_54 contains some functions to print formatted error messages
* codice_55 contains the codice_56 function. This function is used to display non-printable characters in a visual format.

== The C standard library in other languages ==
Some languages include the functionality of the standard C library in their own libraries. The library may be adapted to better suit the language&#x27;s structure, but the operational semantics are kept similar.

=== C++ ===
The C++ language incorporates the majority of the C standard library’s constructs into its own, excluding C-specific machinery. C standard library functions are exported from the C++ standard library in two ways.

For backwards-/cross-compatibility to C and pre-Standard C++, functions can be accessed in the global namespace (), after ing the C standard header name as in C. Thus, the C++98 program #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
 return ::puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;) == EOF;
} should exhibit (apparently-)identical behavior to C95 program #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
 return puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;) == EOF;

From C++98 on, C functions are also made available in namespace (e.g., C  as C++ , as , as ), by including header codice_57 instead of corresponding C header codice_58. E.g., substitutes for and for ; note lack of &quot; extension on C++ header names.

Thus, an equivalent (generally preferable) C++≥98 program to the above two is: #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int main() {
 return std::puts(&quot;Hello, world&quot;) == EOF;

A declaration above or within 
 can be issued to apply the prefix automatically, although it’s generally considered poor practice to use it globally in headers because it pollutes the global namespace.

A few of the C++≥98 versions of C’s headers are missing; e.g., C≥11 and have no C++ counterparts.

Others are reduced to placeholders, such as (until C++20) for C95 , all of whose requisite macros are rendered as keywords in C++98. C-specific syntactic constructs aren’t generally supported, even if their header is.

Several C headers exist primarily for C++ compatibility, and these tend to be near-empty in C++. For example, C99–17 require only #define bool _Bool
#define false 0
#define true 1
#define __bool_true_false_are_defined 1 in order to feign support for the C++98 , , and keywords in C. C++11 requires and for compatibility, but all they need to define is . C23 obsoletes older keyword in favor of new, C++98-equivalent , , and keywords, so the C≥23 and C++≥11 / headers are fully equivalent. (In particular, C23 doesn’t require any macro for .)

Access to C library functions via namespace and the C++≥98 header names is preferred where possible. To encourage adoption, C++98 obsoletes the C (&quot;) header names, so it’s possible that use of C compatibility headers will cause an especially strict C++98–20 preprocessor to raise a diagnostic of some sort. However, C++23 (unusually) de-obsoletes these headers, so newer C++ implementations/modes shouldn’t complain without being asked to specifically.
Other languages take a similar approach, placing C compatibility functions/routines under a common namespace; these include D, Perl, and Ruby.
=== Python ===
CPython includes wrappers for some of the C library functions in its own common library, and it also grants more direct access to C functions and variables via its &quot;&quot; package.

More generally, Python 2. specifies the built-in file objects as being “implemented using C&#x27;s &quot;stdio&quot; package,&quot; and frequent reference is made to C standard library behaviors; the available operations (, , , etc.) are expected to have the same behavior as the corresponding C functions (, , , etc.).

Python 3’s specification relies considerably less on C specifics than Python 2, however.

=== Rust ===
Rust offers crate , which allows various C standard (and other) library functions and type definitions to be used.

== Comparison to standard libraries of other languages ==
The C standard library is small compared to the standard libraries of some other languages. The C library provides a basic set of mathematical functions, string manipulation, type conversions, and file and console-based I/O. It does not include a standard set of &quot;container types&quot; like the C++ Standard Template Library, let alone the complete graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits, networking tools, and profusion of other functionality that Java and the .NET Framework provide as standard. The main advantage of the small standard library is that providing a working ISO C environment is much easier than it is with other languages, and consequently porting C to a new platform is comparatively easy.

<text>Tales from Topographic Oceans is the sixth studio album by English progressive rock band Yes, released in the UK on 7 December 1973 and in the US on 9 January 1974 by Atlantic Records. It is their first studio album to feature drummer Alan White, who had replaced Bill Bruford the previous year. Frontman Jon Anderson devised its concept during the Close to the Edge Tour, when he read a footnote in &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; by Paramahansa Yogananda that describes four bodies of Hindu texts about a specific field of knowledge, collectively named shastras–śruti, smriti, puranas, and tantras. After pitching the idea to guitarist Steve Howe, the pair spent the rest of the tour developing an outline of the album&#x27;s musical themes and lyrics.

Rehearsals lasted for two months in London, during which the band decided to produce a double album containing four side-long tracks based on each text, ranging between 18 and 21 minutes. Keyboardist Rick Wakeman was critical of the concept and felt unable to contribute to the more experimental music that was being produced to fit a double album, and distanced himself from the group. Yes decided against recording in the countryside in order to use Britain&#x27;s first 24-track machine at Morgan Studios, where they decorated the studio to resemble a farm. Roger Dean incorporated suggestions from the band into the album&#x27;s cover art, which inspired his designs for the stage used on its tour.

&quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; received mixed reviews upon release and became a symbol of the perceived excesses of progressive rock, but earned a more positive reception in later years. It was a commercial success, becoming the first UK album to be certified Gold based solely on pre-orders, and spent two weeks at number one. In the US it peaked at number 6, where it was certified gold in 1974 for surpassing 500,000 copies. Yes toured the album for five months across Europe and North America, the first half of which featured the entire album performed live. Wakeman, who was against playing the whole album, quit the band at its conclusion to continue his solo career. In 2003, the album was remastered with previously unreleased tracks, and an edition with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Steven Wilson, with additional bonus tracks, followed in 2016.

==Background and writing==
===Conception===

By 1973, Yes had stabilised with a line-up of frontman and lead vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Alan White, who had replaced original drummer Bill Bruford in the previous year. Their fifth album, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972), was released to commercial and critical acclaim, and the band toured worldwide to support the album between July 1972 and April 1973.

Anderson had begun searching for ideas for their next album during this time, one of which involved a &quot;large-scale composition&quot; as the group were writing successful longform pieces, including the 18-minute &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. While in his hotel room in Tokyo during the Japanese tour in March 1973, Anderson found himself &quot;caught up in a lengthy footnote&quot; in &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; by Paramahansa Yogananda which outlines four bodies of Hindu texts named shastras. Yogananda described them as &quot;comprehensive treatises [that cover] every aspect of religious and social life, and the fields of law, medicine, architecture, art...&quot; that &quot;convey profound truths under a veil of detailed symbolism&quot;. Anderson &quot;became engrossed&quot; with the idea of a &quot;four-part epic&quot; concept album based on the four texts, though he later admitted that he only had a basic understanding of them. King Crimson drummer and percussionist Jamie Muir recommended Yogananda&#x27;s book to Anderson at Bruford&#x27;s wedding reception earlier in the month. Anderson said of Muir: &quot;I felt I had to learn from him. We started talking about meditation in music—not the guru type but some really heavy stuff.&quot; Anderson gained further clarification of the texts from talking to Vera Stanley Alder, a mystic, painter, and author of spirituality books that had a profound influence on him. The 1973 BBC documentary series &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; also gave Anderson &quot;a lot to think about&quot;, and was influenced by host Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s explanations of Earth, the solar system, and human &quot;knowledge and truth&quot;.

Yes moved on to Australia and the US in March and April 1973, during which Anderson pitched his idea to Howe, a prolific songwriter and arranger in the group, who took an interest in building on Anderson&#x27;s concept. The pair held writing sessions in their hotel rooms lit by candlelight, exchanging musical and lyrical ideas. Howe recalled: &quot;Jon would say to me, &#x27;What have you got that&#x27;s a bit like that...?&#x27; so I&#x27;d play him something and he&#x27;d go: &#x27;that&#x27;s great. Have you got anything else?&#x27; and I&#x27;d play him another tune&quot;. One riff that Howe played was initially discarded, but it was later incorporated into side three as by then, the two sought for a different theme that would suit the track. Howe looked back on this time as a &quot;golden opportunity&quot; for Anderson and himself to &quot;explore the outer reaches of our possibilities&quot;, and avoided predictable choruses and song structures. A six-hour session in Savannah, Georgia, that ended at 7 a.m. saw Anderson and Howe complete the outline of the album&#x27;s vocals, lyrics, and instrumentation, which took the form of one track based on each of the four texts. Anderson described the night as &quot;magical [that] left both of us exhilarated for days&quot;. Anderson and Howe presented the album&#x27;s concept to the rest of the band, which was met with some uncertainty; Howe recalled: &quot;But Jon and I did manage to sell the idea ... sometimes [we] really had to spur the guys on&quot;.

Phil Carson, then the London Senior Vice President of Atlantic Records, remembered that, during a dinner with Anderson and Nesuhi Ertegun, Anderson was originally going to name the album &quot;Tales from Tobergraphic Oceans&quot;. He claimed he had invented the word &quot;tobergraphic&quot;, which he used to depict one of astronomer Fred Hoyle&#x27;s theories on space. Ertegun informed Anderson that &quot;tobergraphic&quot; was similar to the word &quot;topographic&quot; and described its meaning, and Anderson changed the title accordingly. An interview with Eddy Offord and a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; advert congratulating Yes for winning a readership poll published in August and September 1973, respectively, touted the upcoming album as &quot;Tales from the Tobergraphic Ocean&quot; and &quot;Tales from Tobergraphic Oceans&quot;. Wakeman jokingly nicknamed the album &quot;Tales from Toby&#x27;s Graphic Go-Kart&quot;. 

===Rehearsals at Manticore===

After touring finished, Yes regrouped at Manticore Studios in Fulham, London, a former cinema bought by fellow progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, in May 1973. They spent eight weeks rehearsing and developing Anderson and Howe&#x27;s initial ideas. This resulted in four tracks, as Wakeman described: &quot;One was about eight minutes. One was 15. One was 19 and one was 12, but the band had to decide whether to refine them to fit a single album or extend them to make a double. Howe recalled a mutual agreement to make a double, which Wakeman supported provided that the group could come up with strong enough material. Anderson had gained confidence towards a double from the success of &quot;Yessongs&quot;, their first live album, released as a triple in May 1973 that contained almost 130 minutes of music. Wakeman described an early musical concept for &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; around the time of its release, whereby its parts could be interchangeable at any time depending on the audience&#x27;s reaction, thus allowing the band to perform upbeat portions back to back and skip the slower sections until a later time in the piece. The problem, however, was putting such a concept on a record.

The group agreed to make a double album but had no ideas at hand to develop, so the four tracks were fleshed out through improvisations. Wakeman disagreed with the &quot;almost busking, free-form thinking&quot; approach and the musical &quot;padding&quot; that resulted, which he thought needed further rehearsal. He felt sections resembled &quot;avant-garde jazz rock, and I had nothing to offer&quot;. Squire recognised &quot;a lot of substance&quot; to the four tracks but at times they lacked strength, which resulted in an album that was varied and scattered. Despite the uncertainty, Anderson stated in the liner notes that Squire, Wakeman, and White made important contributions to the music. Anderson looked back at this time and thought the band were on the same page, but disagreements from Wakeman and producer Eddy Offord marked the end of the period of &quot;illusive harmony&quot; that had been in the group since &quot;Fragile&quot;. Yes took a break roughly one month into rehearsals, during which Anderson vacated to Marrakesh with his family and wrote lyrics.

==Recording==
The group were split in deciding where to record; Anderson and Wakeman wanted to retreat in the countryside while Squire and Howe preferred to stay in London, leaving White, who was indifferent, as the tie-breaking vote. Anderson wanted to record at night under a tent in a forest with electrical generators buried into the ground so they would be inaudible, but &quot;when I suggested that, they all said, &#x27;Jon, get a life!&#x27;&quot; Yes were joined by Offord, their engineer and producer who had worked with the band since 1970 and mixed their sound on tour. He pushed their manager, Brian Lane, to record in the country, thinking &quot;some flowers and trees&quot; would lessen the tension that the album was creating within the group. Yes were swayed to remain in London, but wanted to avoid the familiar surroundings of Advision Studios in Fitzrovia, so they chose to record at Morgan Studios in Willesden as it housed a 3M M79, Britain&#x27;s first 24-track tape machine, which presented greater possibilities in the studio. Despite the advantage, the machine malfunctioned often and required periods of down time for repairs. Squire worked in the studio for as long as sixteen-hour days, seven days a week.
In July 1973, Yes settled into studio 3 at Morgan for a period of ten weeks. Lane and Anderson proceeded to decorate the studio to resemble a farm; Squire believed Lane did so as a joke on Anderson as his tent idea was shut down. Anderson brought in flowers, pots of greenery, and cutout cows and sheep; white picket fences were placed around Wakeman&#x27;s keyboards with amplifiers placed on stacks of hay. When Black Sabbath moved into studio 4 to record &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, singer Ozzy Osbourne visited and recalled a model cow with electronic udders and a small barn in the corner, &quot;like a kid&#x27;s plaything.&quot; Offord remembered the cows being covered in graffiti and the plants dying halfway through recording, &quot;that just kind of sums up that whole album&quot;. One time during recording, Anderson wanted to replicate the sound he heard while singing in the bathroom and asked lighting engineer Michael Tait to build him a three-sided tiled booth for him to sing in. Despite Tait explaining how the idea would not work, he built one using plywood and glued tiles on the inside. Sound engineer Nigel Luby recalled tiles falling off the box during takes. Wakeman distanced himself from the band as recording went on and spent most of his time drinking and playing darts in the studio bar. Osbourne befriended him and remembered Wakeman was &quot;bored out of his mind&quot;, and invited him to play the synthesizer on &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot;. Wakeman would not accept money for his contribution, so the band paid him in beer. While talking to reporter Chris Welch in August 1973, Anderson dispelled rumours that someone was quitting the band, and that a difference of opinion from an unnamed member had been resolved.

Yes spent one week putting down the backing tracks for each of the four songs, after which they worked on the overdubs. Howe said a considerable amount of time was spent on both tasks, and took turns with Anderson to lead and convince the other members when they questioned if the arrangements were going to work. Anderson recalled a near-disaster situation with the finished tapes. After working through the night with Offord to complete the last mix, the pair left Morgan at dawn and Offord placed the tapes on the roof of his car to find the keys. He proceeded to drive off, forgetting about the tapes. They stopped the car to find the tapes had fallen onto the road, and Anderson rushed back to save them from an oncoming bus. The tapes were unharmed from the incident. Yes had spent five months arranging, rehearsing, and recording &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;, and their time spent in Morgan amounted to £90,000 in studio costs.

==Songs==

The album contains four tracks, or &quot;movements&quot;, as described by Anderson, that range between 18 and 21 minutes. All band members are credited for composing the music. Anderson provided a short description of how the album came together, and how its concept is expressed in a musical sense in each track, in the album&#x27;s liner notes. The original LP lists Anderson and Howe as co-writers of the lyrics, but the 2003 reissue lists Squire as an additional co-author for &quot;The Ancient&quot; and Squire, Wakeman, and White as additional co-authors for &quot;The Remembering&quot;.

&quot;The Revealing Science of God (Dance of the Dawn)&quot; is based on the shruti, which Yogananda described as scriptures that are &quot;directly heard&quot; or &quot;revealed&quot;, in particular the Vedas. Regarding its title, Anderson said: &quot;It&#x27;s always delicate to start talking about religious things ... [it] should have just been &#x27;The Revealing&#x27;. But I got sort of hip.&quot; The track was originally 28 minutes long, but six minutes were cut due to the time constraints of a record. Anderson was inspired to open the track with voices that gradually build from listening to Gregorian chants, and used the Vietnam War as a source for its lyrics. Howe plays a Gibson ES-345, and his solos were influenced by his belief that Frank Zappa performed lengthy solos &quot;because the audience wanted it. I was thinking at one stage, &#x27;I&#x27;ll do that. They&#x27;ll love it&#x27;. The &quot;Young Christians see it&quot; section originated from an unused take from the &quot;Fragile&quot; sessions, a take from which was released as a bonus track in 2015 as &quot;All Fighters Past&quot;. White recalled the group spent around six days mixing the track. The 2003 CD reissue of the album includes a previously unreleased two minute introduction.

&quot;The Remembering (High the Memory)&quot; relates to the smriti, texts literally meaning &quot;that which is remembered&quot;. Yogananda wrote the smritis were &quot;written down in a remote past as the world&#x27;s longest epic poems&quot;, specifically the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Anderson described it as &quot;a calm sea of music&quot; and wanted the band to play like the sea with &quot;rhythms, eddies, swells, and undercurrents&quot; of sound. The track includes a keyboard solo that Anderson wrote &quot;bring[s] alive the ebb and flow and depth of our mind&#x27;s eye&quot;, and rated it as one of Wakeman&#x27;s best. Squire played a fretless Guild bass, and described his performance as &quot;one of the nicest things&quot; he has done, and ranked it higher than his playing on more popular songs. He considered the track was particularly successful in its arrangement. White came up with the chord basis of a section on a guitar, which he does not play confidently, but Anderson recognised his tune and told him to repeat it until he could grasp his idea. Howe plays a Danelectro electric sitar, lute, and acoustic guitar.
&quot;The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun)&quot; is attributed to the puranas, meaning &quot;of ancient times&quot;, which contain eighteen &quot;ancient&quot; allegories. &quot;Steve&#x27;s guitar&quot;, wrote Anderson, &quot;is pivotal in sharpening reflection on the beauties and treasures of lost civilisations.&quot; The lyrics contain several translations of the word &quot;Sun&quot; or an explanation of the Sun from various languages. Howe felt the opening section amazes him to this day, thinking how the band could &quot;go so far out&quot;. He plays a steel guitar and a Spanish Ramirez acoustic guitar, and described it as &quot;quite Stravinsky, quite folky&quot;. To help achieve the right sound he wanted out of his guitars, Howe played several recordings by classical guitarist Julian Bream to Offord as a guide. The track ends with an acoustic-based song which later became known as &quot;Leaves of Green&quot;. White used a hollowed out log and brushes on an aluminium sheet as percussion.

&quot;Ritual (Nous sommes du soleil)&quot; relates to the tantras, literally meaning rites or rituals. Anderson described its bass and drum solos as a presentation of the fight and struggle that life presents between &quot;sources of evil and pure love&quot;. Howe is particularly fond of his guitar solo at the beginning, which to him was &quot;spine-chilling&quot; and &quot;heavenly to play&quot;, and uses a Gibson Les Paul Junior. He wrote the chords and some lyrics to the &quot;Life is like a fight&quot; section. His outro guitar solo was more improvised and jazz-oriented at first, but the rest of the group felt dissatisfied with the arrangement. Anderson suggested that Howe pick several themes from the album and combine them, which Howe did with &quot;a more concise, more thematic approach&quot;. During one of Wakeman&#x27;s absences from the studio, White came up with the piano sequence for the closing &quot;Nous sommes du soleil&quot; section. The second half contains a percussion jam that features the main melody played on the drums. White, who played a standard kit, taught the sequence to the other members, with Anderson on a cocktail kit and Squire on timpani. Howe, despite participating on the drum solo on stage early on, opted out as it affected his guitar playing afterward.

==Artwork==
The album was packaged as a gatefold sleeve designed and illustrated by Roger Dean, who had also designed the artwork for &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, and &quot;Yessongs&quot;. Each of them carried a loose narrative thread that Dean did not continue for &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;. Dean and Anderson discussed ideas for the cover during a flight from London to Tokyo via Anchorage, Alaska, for the Japanese leg of the Close to the Edge Tour. Prior to the flight, Dean had completed the artwork to John Michell&#x27;s book &quot;The View over Atlantis&quot;. He recalled: &quot;The wives and girlfriends made a cake ... and we all had some. I have no idea what was in it but from London to Anchorage, I was stoned ... But from Anchorage to Tokyo, I couldn&#x27;t stop talking. And I was telling Jon all about this book, about patterns in the landscape and dragon lines, and we were flying hour after hour after hour over the most amazing landscapes ... So the idea of ... a sort of magical landscape and an alternative landscape ... that informed everything: the album cover, the merchandising, the stage.&quot;
Dean, who primarily describes himself as a landscape painter, wished to convey his enthusiasm for landscapes on the cover, and everything depicted in the design is of something that exists. Painted using watercolour and ink, the front depicts fish circling a waterfall under several constellations of stars. In his book &quot;Views&quot;, Dean explained that the final collection of landmarks on the front was more complex than intended &quot;because it seemed appropriate to the nature of the project that everyone who wanted to contribute should do so.&quot; Anderson wanted a Mayan temple at Chichen Itza with the sun behind it, and White suggested using markings from the plains of Nazca. The landscape comprised, amongst other things, famous English rocks taken from Dominy Hamilton&#x27;s postcard collection, including Brimham Rocks, the last rocks at Land&#x27;s End, Logan Rock at Treen, and single stones from Avebury and Stonehenge. Dean thought &quot;the result is a somewhat incongruous mixture, but effective nonetheless.&quot;

Initial pressings included a slipstream in the background behind the fish that was removed from later copies. Although it was not a part of the original design, Anderson persuaded Dean to add it after it had been painted, so Dean drew it on a clear cel and photographed the cover with and without the slipstream. Dean thought the idea still did not work, and used the original design for the advertisements and posters. In 2002, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine voted the album&#x27;s cover as the best cover art of all time.

==Release==
The album was finished in the first week of November 1973, and aired on British radio several times before its release in stores. It was set for broadcast on David Jensen&#x27;s show on Radio Luxembourg on 8 November, but according to Anderson, the radio station somehow received blank tapes, resulting in dead air after the album was introduced. Two more radio broadcasts followed, one on &quot;Your Mother Wouldn&#x27;t Like It&quot; hosted by Nicky Horne on Capital Radio on 9 November, and on &quot;Rock on Radio One&quot; with Pete Drummond on BBC Radio 1 the following day. A listening session was held at Morgan, which studio engineer and manager Roger Quested attended and remembered rows of seats laid out by a set of speakers before the whole album was played. &quot;All but the diehard had drifted away before it had finished.&quot; Radio consultant Lee Abrams recalled the risk and difficulty in getting the album played on American radio, with many stations mainly playing &quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot; and primarily at night hours.

The album was released in the UK on 7 December 1973, followed by its North American release on 9 January 1974. It was a commercial success for the group; following a change in industry regulations by the British Phonographic Industry for albums to qualify for a Gold disc in April 1973, the album became the first UK record to reach Gold certification based on pre-orders alone after 75,000 orders were made. It was number 1 on the UK Album Chart for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. The album was certified Gold in the UK on 1 March 1974 and in the US on 8 February 1974, the latter for surpassing 500,000 copies.

==Reception==
=== Early reviews ===
The album initially received a divided reaction from British critics. Robert Sheldon for &quot;The Times&quot; termed the music as &quot;rockophonic&quot;, and selected &quot;The Ancient&quot; as a piece of music that &quot;will be studied twenty-five years hence as a turning point in modern music&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper thought Anderson&#x27;s &quot;high-pitched and carefully modulated voice ... seemed at ease and control&quot;. Steve Peacock reviewed the album and a live performance of it for &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine using the headlines &quot;Wishy washy tales from the deep&quot; and &quot;Close to boredom&quot;. Critic and Yes biographer Chris Welch reviewed the album for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and wrote: &quot;It is a fragmented masterpiece, assembled with loving care and long hours in the studio. Brilliant in patches, but often taking far too long to make its various points, and curiously lacking in warmth or personal expression&quot;. He thought &quot;Ritual&quot; brought the &quot;first enjoyable moments&quot; of the entire album, &quot;where Alan&#x27;s driving drums have something to grip on to and the lyrics of la la la speak volumes. But even this cannot last long and cohesion is lost once more to the gods of drab self-indulgence.&quot; For &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Steve Clarke, who had listened to the album for two months and saw the band perform the album live once, declared the album &quot;a great disappointment&quot;, coming from the strength of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and notes the &quot;colour and excitement&quot; that the group usually puts on their albums was missing. He thought Wakeman&#x27;s abilities were restricted, and a lack of &quot;positive construction&quot; in the music which too often loses itself to &quot;a wash of synthetic sounds&quot;. Howe&#x27;s guitar adopts the same tone as Wakeman&#x27;s keyboards, which bored Clarke, but Anderson was praised in helping carry the music through with his &quot;frail, pure and at times very beautiful&quot; voice. Clarke concluded with a hope of Yes making a return to &quot;real songs&quot; which demonstrate their musicianship better.

The album also received mixed reviews in America. Abrams thought it could have received better marketing, and suggested &quot;an experiment in recording&quot; as a tag line. &quot;Record World&quot; magazine considered it &quot;by far the most progressive album to date&quot; and displays the talents of each band member well, particularly Wakeman&#x27;s. A review in &quot;Billboard&quot; said the four sides produce mixed results, with Anderson&#x27;s &quot;weighty spiritual concept&quot; having &quot;indigestible lyrics that are fortunately outplayed by the band&#x27;s rich, sweeping playing&quot; and praised Wakeman&#x27;s keyboards in particular. It concluded with &quot;Ritual (Nous sommes du soleil)&quot; as the most &quot;complete&quot; track. In his negative review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Gordon Fletcher described the record as &quot;psychedelic doodles&quot; and thought it suffers from &quot;over-elaboration&quot; compared to more successful songs on &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. He complained about the album&#x27;s length, Howe&#x27;s guitar solos on &quot;The Ancient&quot;, and the percussion section on &quot;Ritual&quot;, but praised Wakeman for his &quot;stellar performance&quot; throughout and believed the keyboardist was the &quot;most human of the group&quot;. Fletcher singled out the acoustic guitar section from &quot;The Ancient&quot; as the album&#x27;s high point. &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine praised the album with its &quot;spectacular cuts&quot; making a &quot;phenomenal&quot; record, and noted the band &quot;are as much in touch with the bright future of their art form as they are with its rich, traditional past&quot;. Wakeman&#x27;s &quot;inspirational&quot; playing was also pointed out which &quot;sparkles&quot; throughout the album. It concluded with &quot;one of this year&#x27;s best without doubt.&quot; In September 1974, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called it &quot;by far the most provocative album of the past year.&quot;

=== Later reviews ===
Retrospectively, Bruce Eder of AllMusic thought the album contains &quot;some of the most sublimely beautiful musical passages ever to come from the group, and develops a major chunk of that music in depth and degrees in ways that one can only marvel at, though there&#x27;s a big leap from marvel to enjoy. If one can grab onto it, &quot;Tales&quot; is a long, sometimes glorious musical ride across landscapes strange and wonderful, thick with enticing musical textures&quot;. In its fortieth anniversary issue from 1992, &quot;NME&quot; selected &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; as their &quot;40 Records That Captured The Moment&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Progression&quot; magazine writer John Covach wrote that it is &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;, not &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, that represents the band&#x27;s true hallmark of the first half of their 1970s output and their &quot;real point of arrival&quot;. He pointed out &quot;the playing is virtuosic throughout, the singing innovative and often complex, and the lyrics mystical and poetic. All this having been asserted ... even the most devoted listener to &quot;Tales&quot; is also forced to admit that the album is in many ways flawed. Tracks tend to wander a bit ... and the music therefore is perhaps not as focused as it might be.&quot; He notes that while Howe &quot;set a new standard for rock guitar&quot;, he thought Wakeman&#x27;s parts were not used properly and that the keyboardist was instead &quot;relegated to the role of sideman&quot;. Author and critic Martin Popoff called the album the &quot;black hole of Yes experiences, the band dissipating, expanding, exploding and imploding all at once&quot;, though he thought it contained &quot;some fairly accessible music&quot;.

=== Band members ===
In January 1974, Squire picked &quot;The Yes Album&quot; and &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; as the two most personally satisfying Yes albums &quot;in terms of being captivated&quot;. In 1984, after Yes had released &quot;90125&quot; (1983), Anderson looked back on &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; as &quot;difficult in some respects&quot;, but felt it was &quot;stupid to even think about defending it.&quot; In 1990, he said that he was pleased with three quarters of the album, with the remaining quarter &quot;not quite jelling&quot;, but the tight deadline to finish it meant there was little time to make the necessary changes. Squire recalled the album as an unhappy period in the band&#x27;s history, and commented on Anderson&#x27;s attitude then: &quot;Jon had this visionary idea that you could just walk into a studio, and if the vibes were right ... the music would be great at the end of the day ... It isn&#x27;t reality&quot;. Wakeman continues to hold a mostly critical view. In 2006, he clarified that there are some &quot;very nice musical moments in &quot;Topographic Oceans&quot;, but because of the format of how records used to be we had too much for a single album but not enough for a double, so we padded it out and the padding is awful ... but there are some beautiful solos like &quot;Nous sommes du soleil&quot; ... one of the most beautiful melodies ... and deserved to be developed even more perhaps.&quot; In 2023, Steve Howe stated that the album was for the band &quot;a time of spreading our wings, a wonderful project where we went to the ends of the Earth to do it. There was often a feeling that disaster was almost about to strike, but we got there in the end. You have to account for &quot;Tales&quot; in our history to properly talk about what Yes achieved, because it was quite exceptional. I don’t think we’d be the same group without it&quot;, adding that he was &quot;still very proud of it and very pleased with it [...] &quot;&quot;Tales&quot; is totally epic, and I love it to bits&quot;.

==Reissues==
Anderson spoke about his wish to edit the album and reissue it as a condensed 60-minute version with remixes and overdubs, but the plan was affected by &quot;personality problems&quot;. The album was digitally remastered for CD by Joe Gastwirt using the original master tapes, in 1994. It was remastered again by Bill Inglot in 2003 as an &quot;expanded&quot; version on Elektra/Rhino Records, which features a restored two-minute introduction to &quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot; not included on the original LP, but previously released on the 2002 box set &quot;In a Word: Yes (1969–)&quot;. The set includes studio run-throughs of the same track and &quot;The Ancient&quot;. The 2003 edition was included in the band&#x27;s 2013 studio album box set, &quot;The Studio Albums 1969–1987&quot;.

&quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; was reissued with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Steven Wilson in October 2016 on the Panegyric label. The four-disc set was available on CD and Blu-ray or DVD-Audio and includes the new mixes, bonus and previously unreleased mixes and tracks, and expanded and restored cover art.

==Tour and aftermath==
Yes had planned to start touring the album with an American leg from October 1973, but it was cancelled in order to have more time to complete it in the studio. Shortly after its release, Anderson wished the album and tour to be pushed back until January 1974 in order to allocate more time for rehearsals, but half of the available tickets for the opening British tour had quickly sold and the band were unable to cancel. Yes sold out five consecutive nights at the Rainbow Theatre in London, which marked the first time a rock band achieved the feat. They tried to secure two extra shows, but the dates were unavailable; promoter Harvey Goldsmith said the huge demand for tickets for the UK dates was comparable to a Rolling Stones tour. The first Rainbow show was to be filmed by the BBC for broadcast on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and to air on radio, but recording did not go ahead. Initial tour rehearsals took place at Manticore.

The 77-date tour visited Europe and North America between November 1973 and April 1974, with a two-hour set of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; performed in their entirety, plus encores. The band toured with no support act. The set was altered as the tour progressed; within a month Lane, Tait, and the road crew had advised Yes to drop &quot;The Ancient&quot; as they thought it was dragging the set, but the group had started to perform it better and kept it in. &quot;The Remembering&quot; was removed completely from March. The North American leg included two sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City that grossed over $200,000, (equivalent to $1,276,024 in 2024). The band spent £5,000 on a hot air balloon which was decorated with the album&#x27;s artwork and tethered in each city they performed in the US.

Yes brought four times as much equipment than their previous tours, which included an elaborate set designed by Dean and his brother Martyn. Two versions of the stage were built; the second, used from the American leg onward, consisted of fibreglass structures, dry ice effects, a drum platform surrounding White, and a tunnel that the band emerged from. During one show, the structure around White that opened and closed failed to operate, leaving him trapped inside. White and Wakeman claimed the incident was the inspiration behind a scene depicted in the rock mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;. Tait spent £10,000 on lighting equipment for the tour, and Offord mixed the band&#x27;s live sound using a 24-track mixing desk.

No full recording from the tour has been officially released, apart from a performance of &quot;Ritual&quot; from Zürich in April 1974 on the album&#x27;s 2016 reissue. Yes continued to perform &quot;Ritual&quot; until the end of their 1976 North American tour, after which material from &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; would not be performed for 20 years, when the album&#x27;s line-up reunited for the &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot; albums and performed &quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot;. From 1997 to 2004 either &quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot; or &quot;Ritual&quot; was performed live, which included the latter performed with an orchestra on stage in 2001. From 2016 to 2018, Yes performed sides one and four as part of their Album Series Tour.

===Wakeman&#x27;s departure===
Following the Rainbow gigs Wakeman called for a band meeting and announced his decision to quit, but the band, Lane, and Carson convinced him to stay for the rest of the tour. His frustration from playing the entire album, and the lack of rehearsal time for the British tour, culminated at a subsequent show in Manchester where his technician brought him a curry which he ate on stage. Roadie Bill Turner recalled Wakeman waving to the audience with a hand puppet and running a wind-up toy dinosaur across the stage when he got bored. Anderson felt he had pushed Wakeman too far, as he was unsatisfied with one of his keyboard solos in the set and had constantly asked him to get it right. Despite the problems, Wakeman said the situation improved as the American leg progressed. When the tour finished, Wakeman declined to attend rehearsals for their next album and confirmed his exit on 18 May 1974, his twenty-fifth birthday; later that day, he found out his solo album, &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;, had entered the UK chart at number one. Wakeman was replaced by Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz.

<text>Samuel Eliot Morison (July 9, 1887 – May 15, 1976) was an American historian noted for his works of maritime history and American history that were both authoritative and popular. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1912, and taught history at the university for 40 years. He won Pulitzer Prizes for &quot;Admiral of the Ocean Sea&quot; (1942), a biography of Christopher Columbus, and &quot;John Paul Jones: A Sailor&#x27;s Biography&quot; (1959). In 1942, he was commissioned to write a history of United States naval operations in World War II, which was published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962. Morison wrote the popular &quot;Oxford History of the American People&quot; (1965), and co-authored the classic textbook &quot;The Growth of the American Republic&quot; (1930) with Henry Steele Commager.

Over the course of his career, Morison received eleven honorary doctoral degrees, and garnered numerous literary prizes, military honors, and national awards from both foreign countries and the United States, including two Pulitzer Prizes, two Bancroft Prizes, the Balzan Prize, the Legion of Merit, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life (1887–1912)==
Samuel Eliot Morison was born July 9, 1887, in Boston, Massachusetts, to John Holmes Morison (1856–1911) and Emily Marshall (Eliot) Morison (1857–1925). He was named for his maternal grandfather Samuel Eliot—a historian, educator, and public-minded citizen of Boston and Hartford, Connecticut. The Eliot family, which produced generations of prominent American intellectuals, descended from Andrew Eliot, who moved to Boston in the 1660s from the English village of East Coker. The most famous of this Andrew Eliot&#x27;s direct descendants was poet T.S. Eliot, who titled the second of his &quot;Four Quartets&quot; &quot;East Coker&quot;.

Morison attended Noble and Greenough School (1897–1901) and St. Paul&#x27;s (1901–1903) prior to entering Harvard University, where he was a member of the Phoenix S K Club. At the age of fourteen, he learned to sail, and soon after learned horsemanship—both skills would serve him well in his later historical writings. He earned both a Bachelor of Arts and Master&#x27;s degree from Harvard in 1908. After studying at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques (1908–1909), Morison returned to Harvard.

==Scholar and historian (1913–1941)==
Morison originally intended to major in mathematics until Albert Bushnell Hart talked him into researching some papers of an ancestor stored in his wine cellar. His Harvard dissertation was the basis for his first book &quot;The Life and Letters of Harrison Gray Otis, Federalist, 1765–1848&quot; (1913), which sold 700 copies. After earning his Ph.D. at Harvard, Morison became an instructor in history at the University of California, Berkeley in 1912. In 1915 he returned to Harvard and took a position as an instructor. During World War I he served as a private in the US Army. He also served as the American Delegate on the Baltic Commission of the Paris Peace Conference until June 17, 1919.

In 1922–1925 Morison taught at Oxford University as the first Harmsworth Professor of American History. In 1925 he returned to Harvard, where he was appointed a full professor. One of several subjects that fascinated Morison was the history of New England. As early as 1921 he published &quot;The Maritime History of Massachusetts, 1783–1860&quot;. In the 1930s Morison published a series of books on the history of Harvard University and New England, including &quot;Builders of the Bay Colony: A Gallery of Our Intellectual Ancestors&quot; (1930), &quot;The Founding of Harvard College&quot; (1935), &quot;Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century&quot; (1936), &quot;Three Centuries of Harvard: 1636–1936&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Puritan Pronaos&quot; (1936). In later years, he returned to the subject of New England history, writing &quot;The Ropemakers of Plymouth&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Story of the &#x27;Old Colony&#x27; of New Plymouth&quot; (1956) and editing the definitive work, &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation, 1620–1647&quot; (1952).

Returning to Harvard in 1925, it is noteworthy that Morison was the last professor to arrive there on horseback. He was chosen to speak at the 300th Anniversary celebration of Harvard in 1936 and a recording of his speech is included as part of the &quot;Harvard Voices&quot; collection.

In 1938 Morison was elected as an honorary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati.

In 1940, Morison published &quot;Portuguese Voyages to America in the Fifteenth Century&quot;, a book that presaged his succeeding publications on the explorer, Christopher Columbus. In 1941, Morison was named Jonathan Trumbull Professor of American History at Harvard. For &quot;Admiral of the Ocean Sea&quot; (1942), Morison combined his personal interest in sailing with his scholarship by actually sailing to the various places that Columbus explored. The Harvard Columbus Expedition, led by Morison and including his wife and Captain John W. McElroy, Herbert F. Hossmer, Jr., Richard S. Colley, Dr. Clifton W. Anderson, Kenneth R. Spear and Richard Spear, left on 28 August 1939 aboard the 147 foot ketch &quot;Capitana&quot; for the Azores and Lisbon, Portugal from which they sailed on the 45 foot ketch &quot;Mary Otis&quot; to retrace Columbus&#x27; route using manuscripts and records of his voyages reaching Trinidad by way of Cadiz, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. After following the coast of South and Central America the expedition returned to Trinidad on 15 December 1939. The expedition returned to New York on 2 February 1940 aboard the United Fruit liner . The book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1943.

==Naval war service (1942–1952)==
In 1942, Morison met with his friend President Franklin D. Roosevelt and offered to write a history of United States Navy operations during the war from an insider&#x27;s perspective by taking part in operations and documenting them. The President and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox agreed to the proposal. On May 5, 1942, Morison was commissioned a lieutenant commander in the US Naval Reserve, and was called at once to active duty. 
Gregory Pfitzer explained his procedures:

Morison worked with a team of researchers to prepare the &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War II&quot;, published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962, documenting everything from strategy and tactics to technology and the exploits of individuals. British military historian Sir John Keegan called it the best to come out of that conflict. Issued as &quot;The Rising Sun in the Pacific&quot; in 1948, Volume 3 won the Bancroft Prize in 1949.

Morison was promoted to the rank of captain on December 15, 1945. On August 1, 1951, he was transferred to the Honorary Retired List of the Naval Reserve and was promoted to rear admiral on the basis of combat awards.

In &quot;History as a Literary Art: An Appeal to Young Historians&quot; (1946), Morison argued that vivid writing springs from the synergy of experience and research:

==Later years (1953–1976)==
In 1955, Morison retired from Harvard University. He devoted the rest of his life to writing. In quick succession, Morison wrote &quot;Christopher Columbus, Mariner&quot; (1955), &quot;Freedom in Contemporary Society&quot; (1956), &quot;The Story of the &#x27;Old Colony&#x27; of New Plymouth, 1620–1692&quot; (1956), &quot;Nathaniel Holmes Morison&quot; (1957), &quot;William Hickling Prescott&quot; (1958), &quot;Strategy and Compromise&quot; (1958), and &quot;John Paul Jones: A Sailor&#x27;s Biography&quot; (1959), which earned Morison his second Pulitzer Prize.

In the early 1960s, Morison&#x27;s focus returned to his New England youth, writing &quot;The Story of Mount Desert Island, Maine&quot; (1960), &quot;One Boy&#x27;s Boston, 1887–1901&quot; (1962), &quot;Introduction to Whaler Out of New Bedford&quot; (1962), and &quot;A History of the Constitution of Massachusetts&quot; (1963). In 1963, &quot;The Two-Ocean War&quot; was published, a one-volume abridged history of the United States Navy in World War II.

In 1964, Morison received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Lyndon B. Johnson. In presenting the distinguished historian with the highest civilian award in the United States, Johnson noted:

Morison&#x27;s later years were devoted to books on exploration, such as &quot;The Caribbean as Columbus Saw It,&quot; written jointly with Mauricio Obregón (1964), &quot;Spring Tides&quot; (1965), &quot;The European Discovery of America&quot; (1971–1974), and &quot;Samuel de Champlain: Father of New France&quot; (1972). His research for the latter book included sailing many of the routes taken by Champlain, and tracing others by airplane.

Morison&#x27;s first marriage to Elizabeth S. Greene produced four children—one of whom, Emily Morison Beck, became editor of &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot;. Elizabeth died August 20, 1945. In 1949, Morison married Baltimore widow Priscilla Barton. Priscilla died February 22, 1973.

==Death and legacy==
Morison died of a stroke on May 15, 1976. His ashes are buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Northeast Harbor, Maine.

During his life Morison had received two Pulitzer Prizes, two Bancroft Prizes, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&#x27; Emerson-Thoreau Medal (1961), and numerous honorary degrees, military awards, and honors from foreign nations.

On July 19, 1979, the frigate USS &quot;Samuel Eliot Morison&quot; was launched, honoring Morison and his contributions to the United States Navy. Morison&#x27;s legacy is also sustained by the United States Naval History and Heritage Command&#x27;s Samuel Eliot Morison Naval History Scholarship. Boston&#x27;s Commonwealth Avenue Mall features a bronze statue depicting Morison in sailor&#x27;s oilskin.

Morison&#x27;s last known public appearance was on April 8, 1976, when he served as the ribbon cutter to open the USS Constitution Museum. &quot;The Museum&#x27;s research library and an annual award given by the Museum for scholarship in history are both named in his honor.&quot; The museum gives the annual Samuel Eliot Morison Award to a person whose public service has enhanced the image of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, and who reflects the best of Samuel Eliot Morison: artful scholarship, patriotic pride, and eclectic interest in the sea and things maritime.

In 1976, the &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine initiated an award named in honor of Morison called the Samuel Eliot Morison Award, honoring an American author whose work shows &quot;that good history is literature as well as high scholarship.&quot; It lasted two years.

Since 1982, the Naval Order of the United States gives an honor in Morison&#x27;s name, the Samuel Eliot Morison Award for Naval Literature, for significant works about the US Navy.

In 1985, the Society for Military History established the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize, recognizing an author&#x27;s body of contributions in the field of military history.

==Criticism==
===Slavery===
Morison was criticized by some African-American scholars for his treatment of American slavery in early editions of his book &quot;The Growth of the American Republic&quot;, which he co-wrote with Henry Steele Commager and later with Commager&#x27;s student William E. Leuchtenburg. The book originated as Morison&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Oxford History of the United States&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1927). First published in 1930, the first two editions of the textbook, according to these critics, echoed the thesis of &quot;American Negro Slavery&quot; (1918) by Ulrich Bonnell Phillips. This view, sometimes called the Phillips school of slavery historiography, was considered an authoritative interpretation of the history of American slavery during the first half of the twentieth century, despite the intense criticism by some African-American scholars for its alleged racist underpinnings. Phillips&#x27;s theories remained authoritative, considered by many white scholars to be ground-breaking and progressive when first proposed. In 1944, the NAACP began its criticism of &quot;The Growth of the American Republic&quot;.

In 1950, despite denying any racist intent (he noted his daughter&#x27;s marriage to the son of Joel Elias Spingarn, the second president of the NAACP), Morison reluctantly agreed to most of the demanded changes. Morison refused to eliminate references to slaves who were loyal and devoted to their masters because they were treated well and to some positive &quot;civilizing&quot; effects of the American system of slavery. Morison also refused to remove references to stereotypes of African Americans that he believed were vital in accurately depicting the racist nature of American culture in the 19th and the early 20th centuries, an era during which even the most enlightened progressive thinkers routinely explained many aspects of human behavior as a result of innate racial or ethnic characteristics. In the 1962 edition of the textbook, Morison removed additional content that his critics had found to be offensive.

===Battle of Savo Island===
In his semi-official account of the Battle of Savo Island, a disastrous defeat for the US Navy during World War II, Morison partly blamed the defeat on the failure of an Australian aircrew to inform the Americans of the approaching Japanese forces. Morison appears to have based that story on inaccurate information that has since been refuted. On October 21, 2014, the US Navy issued a letter of apology to the last surviving member of the RAAF Hudson crew, which had sighted and duly reported the approach of the Japanese Naval Task Force. The letter states that &quot;RAdm. Morison&#x27;s criticism was unwarranted.&quot;

<text>Antonio Cipriano José María y Francisco de Santa Ana Machado y Ruiz (26 July 1875 – 22 February 1939), known as Antonio Machado, was a Spanish poet and one of the leading figures of the Spanish literary movement known as the Generation of &#x27;98. His work, initially modernist, evolved towards an intimate form of symbolism with romantic traits. He gradually developed a style characterised by both an engagement with humanity on one side and an almost Taoist contemplation of existence on the other, a synthesis that, according to Machado, echoed the most ancient popular wisdom. In Gerardo Diego&#x27;s words, Machado &quot;spoke in verse and lived in poetry.&quot;

==Biography==
Machado was born in Seville, Spain, one year after his brother Manuel. He was a grandson to the noted Spanish folklorist, Cipriana Álvarez Durán. The family moved to Madrid in 1883 and both brothers enrolled in the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. During these years—with the encouragement of his teachers—Antonio discovered his passion for literature. While completing his &quot;Bachillerato&quot; in Madrid, economic difficulties forced him to take several jobs, including working as an actor. In 1899, he and his brother traveled to Paris to work as translators for a French publisher. During these months in Paris, he came into contact with the great French Symbolist poets Jean Moréas, Paul Fort and Paul Verlaine, and also with other contemporary literary figures, including Rubén Darío and Oscar Wilde. These encounters cemented Machado&#x27;s decision to dedicate himself to poetry.

In 1901, he had his first poems published in the literary journal &#x27;Electra&#x27;. His first book of poetry was published in 1903, titled &quot;Soledades&quot;. Over the next few years, he gradually amended the collection, removing some and adding many more. In 1907, the definitive collection was published with the title &quot;Soledades&quot; and &quot;Galerías. Otros Poemas&quot;. In the same year, Machado was offered the job of Professor of French at the school in Soria. Here, he met Leonor Izquierdo, daughter of the owners of the boarding house Machado was staying in. They were married in 1909, he was 34 and Leonor was 15. Early in 1911, the couple went to live in Paris where Machado read more French literature and studied philosophy. In the summer however, Leonor was diagnosed with advanced tuberculosis and they returned to Spain. On 1 August 1912, Leonor died, just a few weeks after the publication of &quot;Campos de Castilla&quot;. Machado was devastated and left Soria, the city that had inspired the poetry of &quot;Campos&quot;, never to return. He went to live in Baeza, Andalusia, where he stayed until 1919. Here, he wrote a series of poems dealing with the death of Leonor which were added to a new (and now definitive) edition of &quot;Campos de Castilla&quot; published in 1916 along with the first edition of &quot;Nuevas canciones&quot;. While his earlier poems are in an ornate, Modernist style, with the publication of &quot;Campos de Castilla&quot; he showed an evolution toward greater simplicity, a characteristic that was to distinguish his poetry from then on.

Between 1919 and 1931, Machado was Professor of French at the Instituto de Segovia, in Segovia. He moved there to be nearer to Madrid, where Manuel lived. The brothers would meet at weekends to work together on a number of plays, the performances of which earned them great popularity. It was here also that Antonio had a secret affair with Pilar de Valderrama, a married woman with three children, to whom he would refer in his work by the name &quot;Guiomar&quot;. In 1932, he was given the post of professor at the &quot;Instituto Calderón de la Barca&quot; in Madrid. He collaborated with Rafael Alberti and published articles in his magazine, &quot;Octubre&quot;, in 1933–1934.

When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, Machado was in Madrid. The war permanently separated him from his brother Manuel who was trapped in the Nationalist (Francoist) zone, and from Valderrama who was in Portugal. Machado was evacuated with his elderly mother and uncle to Valencia, and then to Barcelona in 1938. Finally, as Franco closed in on the last Republican strongholds, they were obliged to move across the French border to Collioure. It was here, on 22 February 1939, that Antonio Machado died, just three days before his mother. In his pocket was found his last poem, &quot;Estos días azules y este sol de infancia&quot;. Machado is buried in Collioure where he died; Leonor is buried in Soria.

On his way to Collioure in December 1938, he wrote &quot;For the strategists, for the politicians, for the historians, all this will be clear: we lost the war. But at a human level I am not so sure: perhaps we won&quot;.&quot;&quot;

He turned away from the hermetic esthetic principles of post-symbolism and cultivated the dynamic openness of social realism. Like such French æsthetes as Verlaine, Machado began with a fin de siècle contemplation of his sensory world, portraying it through memory and the impressions of his private consciousness. And like his socially conscious colleagues of the Generation of 1898, he emerged from his solitude to contemplate Spain&#x27;s historical landscape with a sympathetic yet unindulgent eye. His poetic work begins with the publication of &quot;Soledades&quot; in 1903. In this short volume, many personal links which will characterize his later work are noticeable. In &quot;Soledades, Galerías. Otros poemas&quot;, published in 1907, his voice becomes his own and influences 20th Century poets Octavio Paz, Derek Walcott, and Giannina Braschi who writes about Machado&#x27;s impact in her Spanglish classic &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot;. The most typical feature of his personality is the antipathetic, softly sorrowful tone that can be felt even when he describes real things or common themes of the time, for example abandoned gardens, old parks or fountains: places which he approaches via memory or dreams.

After Machado&#x27;s experience with the introspective poetry of his first period, he withdrew from the spectacle of his conflictive personality and undertook to witness the general battle of the &quot;two Spains&quot;, each one struggling to gain the ascendancy. In 1912, he published &quot;Campos de Castilla&quot;, a collection of poems lyricising the beauty of the Castilian countryside. Just as the poet&#x27;s own personality revealed mutually destructive elements in the earlier &quot;Galerías&quot; and &quot;Soledades,&quot; so too did the Cain–Abel Bible story, interpreted in &quot;La Tierra de Alvargonzález&quot;, later attest to the factions in Spain that shredded one another and the national fabric in an effort to restore unity. At the same time, other poems projected Castilian archetypes that evoked emotions like pathos (&quot;La mujer manchega&quot;, &quot;The Manchegan Woman&quot;), revulsion (&quot;Un criminal&quot;), and stark rapture (&quot;Campos de Soria&quot;). The book also included a series of short reflective poems, often resembling popular songs or sayings, called &quot;Proverbios y Cantares&quot; (Proverbs and Songs).

In 1917, various poems were added to &quot;Campos&quot;, including a group of poems written in Baeza about the death of his young wife, new &quot;Proverbios y Cantares&quot;, and a series of &quot;Elogios&quot;, dedicated to people such as Rubén Darío and Juan Ramón Jiménez who had been influential in his life.

Machado&#x27;s later poems serve as a virtual anthropology of Spain&#x27;s common people, depicting their collective psychology, social mores, and historical destiny. He creates this panorama through fundamental myths and recurring, timeless patterns of group behavior. These archetypes are developed in his work &quot;Campos de Castilla&quot; (&quot;Castilian Fields&quot;), particularly in key poems such as &quot;La tierra de Alvargonzález&quot; and &quot;Por tierras de España,&quot; which draw on Biblical inheritance stories. The metaphors from this period employ geographical and topographical references to convey strong judgments about the socio-economic and moral conditions on the Peninsula.

His next book, &quot;Nuevas canciones&quot; (&quot;New Songs&quot;), published in 1924, marks the last period of his work. The complete works of his poetry, &quot;Poesías Completas&quot; was published in 1938 and contains &quot;Poesias de Guerra&quot; (&quot;Poems of War&quot;), with &quot;El crimen fue en Granada&quot; (&quot;The crime took place in Granada&quot;), an elegy to Federico García Lorca.

Poet Geoffrey Hill has hailed him as Montale&#x27;s &#x27;grand equal&#x27;. His phrase &quot;the two Spains&quot;—one that dies and one that yawns—referring to the left-right political divisions that led to the Civil War, has passed into Spanish and other languages.

The band is composed of Damian Kulash (lead vocals, guitar), Tim Nordwind (bass, vocals), Dan Konopka (drums and percussion), and Andy Ross (guitar, keyboards and vocals), who joined them in 2005, replacing original guitarist Andy Duncan. The band is known for its quirky and complex music videos which are often elaborately choreographed to be filmed in a single long take.

The original members formed as OK Go in 1998 and released two studio albums before Duncan&#x27;s departure. The band&#x27;s video for &quot;Here It Goes Again&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2007.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1998–2000)===
The band&#x27;s lead singer, Damian Kulash, met bassist Tim Nordwind at Interlochen Arts Camp near Traverse City, Michigan, when they were 11. The band name comes from an inside joke developed at Interlochen; their art teacher had an often high assistant who would repeatedly say, &quot;OK... Go!&quot; while they were drawing. They kept in touch after camp, often exchanging mixtapes which influenced each other&#x27;s musical tastes and the band&#x27;s future sound. They met the band&#x27;s future guitarist and keyboardist Andy Duncan in high school. Nordwind and Duncan moved to Chicago for college, and, with drummer Dan Konopka, formed the band Stanley&#x27;s Joyful Noise. After graduating from Brown University, Kulash moved to Chicago. The quartet formed OK Go with the name being &quot;an obvious choice for us&quot; according to Nordwind.

The band marketed themselves aggressively, putting up posters all around Chicago and touring heavily. Within a year the group had shared the stage with international artists such as Elliott Smith, the Promise Ring, the Olivia Tremor Control and Sloan. At the end of 2000, the band was invited by radio host Ira Glass to serve as the house band for live performances of &quot;This American Life&quot;. Glass also helped the band creatively after asking Kulash the question, &quot;Do you see yourselves as being earnest or clever?&quot; Kulash struggled with the question before deciding that the answer was &quot;earnest.&quot; &quot;I wanted to write a full-on rock song, one that made me feel like Queen songs made me feel,&quot; after which he wrote &quot;Get Over It&quot;.

The band self-released two EPs, titled &quot;Brown EP&quot; (2000) and &quot;Pink EP&quot; (2001), which were culled from an album&#x27;s worth of songs recorded in February 2000 with producer Dave Trumfio, to serve as demos. The demos did not land the band a label deal, but got them the attention of booking agent Frank Riley, who booked them as the opening act for a few shows by They Might Be Giants. OK Go would eventually open for the Giants on five tours; singer John Flansburgh briefly sought to co-manage them. 

In 2001 the group moved to Los Angeles, although they considered their Chicago roots important even a decade later.

===&quot;OK Go&quot; (2001–2004)===

In April 2001, the band signed with Capitol Records, forgoing offers from bigger labels because they believed that, as the first signing by newly hired label president Andy Slater, they would get more attention and support.

The band recorded its self-titled debut album at the Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. OK Go&#x27;s original plan was to do minor tweaks to its original demo recordings; instead, the band rerecorded everything and added five new songs, including the first single &quot;Get Over It,&quot; which later appeared in &quot;Triple Play Baseball,&quot; &quot;Madden NFL 2003,&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot; video games. 

The label delayed the album&#x27;s release from its original June 2002 date to September 17. To promote the album, the label sent out miniature ping pong tables to press outlets, a reference to the &quot;Get Over It&quot; video directed by Francis Lawrence, while the band toured with acts including the Vines, Phantom Planet, Superdrag, the Donnas, Fountains of Wayne, and Mew, and played festival shows including Leeds in 2002 and 2003, and NoisePop, Reading, Witnness, and T in the Park in 2003.

In the United States, the album reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Chart and #107 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Chart. In the United Kingdom, the first single &quot;Get Over It&quot; debuted at no. 27, in the UK singles chart on March 16, 2003, and the band performed it on that week&#x27;s edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Also that week, the single&#x27;s video was named video of the week by &quot;Q magazine&quot;.

===&quot;Oh No&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot; (2005–2008)===
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Oh No&quot;, was recorded in Malmö, Sweden, in the fall of 2004 and was produced by Tore Johansson (the Cardigans, Franz Ferdinand) and mixed by Dave Sardy (Nine Inch Nails, Jet, System of a Down). In February 2005, Andy Duncan left the band, citing creative differences, major label pressures, and the band&#x27;s rigorous touring schedule. Duncan was replaced by Andy Ross, who beat out 34 other guitarists who auditioned for the role, in a process that ended with each candidate being asked about their willingness to do a choreographed dance on stage. Ross introduced himself to the band&#x27;s fans by writing a blog post entitled &quot;The Will To Rock,&quot; in which he detailed life on the road, beginning with his first show with the band on February 18, 2005.

Released in August 2005, &quot;Oh No&quot; gained popularity for its first single, &quot;A Million Ways&quot;. Ross programmed a web application, hosted at a1000000ways.com, that allowed people to hear the single and to share it with their friends in exchange for free downloads from the iTunes music store. The video for &quot;A Million Ways&quot; featured the band in a backyard performing a dance choreographed by lead singer Kulash&#x27;s sister, Trish Sie. By August 2006, the video had become the most downloaded music video ever, with over 9 million downloads. The band performed the dance live on British TV show &quot;Soccer AM&quot;, as well as on the late-night American comedy show &quot;Mad TV&quot;. The US version of the album includes &quot;9027 km&quot;, a 35-minute track of lead singer Damian Kulash&#x27;s girlfriend sleeping that is not listed on the album art. Fans speculated that the track&#x27;s name is derived from the distance between Los Angeles, California, and Malmö, Sweden, where the album was recorded and that the track was included to prevent the band&#x27;s label from using the extra space for digital rights management (DRM) software. On December 6, 2005, Kulash published an op-ed piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; advocating against record labels&#x27; use of DRM.

The band toured extensively to support &quot;Oh No&quot;, sharing dates with Death Cab For Cutie, Panic! at the Disco, Kaiser Chiefs, and Snow Patrol. They did special performances, including free shows on New Year&#x27;s Eve in New York City&#x27;s Times Square and in the parking lot before the University of Michigan-vs.-Michigan State University football game They played festivals such as the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Bennicassim in Spain, Formoz Festival in Taiwan, Summer Sonic in Japan, and Incheon Pentaport in South Korea.

On November 7, 2006, after the success of the &quot;Here It Goes Again&quot; video, the band released a deluxe DVD version of the album. The DVD contains a documentary on the making of the album, the four official Capitol Records videos, a video of the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Chic-a-Go-Go&quot;, a &quot;super cut&quot; of the hundreds of fan versions of the &quot;A Million Ways&quot; dance, a behind-the-scenes video of the making of &quot;Here It Goes Again&quot;, rehearsals for the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, an acoustic performance of &quot;What to Do,&quot; a video for &quot;There&#x27;s A Fire&quot; featuring video game characters, a dance booth version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me”, and live versions of &quot;Do What You Want&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re So Damn Hot.&quot;

After visiting New Orleans in 2007, the band returned to record an EP with New Orleans funk rock band Bonerama and producer Mark Nevers, to raise money for musicians who were still displaced by the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. The EP, entitled &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;, was released on Mardi Gras, February 5, 2008. The title is taken from a line in David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot;, a cover of which appears on the EP, along with renditions of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; and three songs from &quot;Oh No&quot;. The EP was sold through iTunes and raised over $40,000, which helped buy a new home for New Orleans musician Al &quot;Carnival Time&quot; Johnson in the Musicians Village. Johnson, who sings on &quot;I Will Be Released,&quot; the final song on the EP, moved into his new home in December 2008. In support of the EP, OK Go and Bonearama played benefit shows on January 11, 2008, at Tipitina&#x27;s in New Orleans, and on February 2, 2008, at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C. The D.C. show was streamed live by NPR and featured on a subsequent NPR podcast.

===&quot;Of the Blue Colour of the Sky&quot; (2008–2012)===

On October 12, 2008, OK Go announced that the members had finished writing new songs for its third album and were in the studios in upstate New York with producer Dave Fridmann (the Flaming Lips, MGMT). The band previewed its third album, titled &quot;Of the Blue Colour of the Sky&quot;, with several dates on the U.S. East Coast, starting in Philadelphia on March 6, 2009, at the TLA Theatre. The name of the album comes from a pseudo-scientific book written by Augustus Pleasonton in 1876 entitled &quot;The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Colour of the Sky&quot;. The members of the band have said that these songs are the &quot;danciest, most anthemic, most heartbroken, and honest songs&quot; of their career, and the album itself takes a much more funky, dance-prone, yet melancholy sound to it, drawing influence from Prince. On May 7, 2009, a song from the album, titled &quot;Skyscrapers,&quot; was released for streaming online. The first single, &quot;WTF?&quot;, was released on November 17, 2009. On January 8, 2010, OK Go appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and performed a song from the album, &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot;. &quot;Of the Blue Colour of the Sky&quot; was released on January 12, 2010.

After the first two videos for &quot;Of the Blue Colour of the Sky&quot; were posted to YouTube in 2009, the band was quickly met with complaints from fans who were only able to view them on YouTube. In response, Kulash posted a long letter on the band&#x27;s website explaining the record label&#x27;s policies. The letter itself went viral, after being reprinted in Gizmodo, cited as &quot;required reading&quot; on BoingBoing, and excerpted on many other websites. At the end of the letter, Kulash included embed codes for the band&#x27;s most recent video in direct opposition to the desires of the label. On February 20, 2010, the &quot;New York Times&quot; printed an op-ed in which Kulash furthered the arguments he made in his open letter.

On March 9, 2010, the band uploaded a video to YouTube entitled &quot;OK Go Announces new label,&quot; in which Kulash, accompanied by two dogs in neckties, announces the creation of Paracadute. On March 10, 2010, the band announced it had cut ties with EMI and Capitol and formed the independent label Paracadute. The split became official on April 1, 2010. Paracadute then assumed ownership of the album, &quot;Of the Blue Colour of the Sky&quot;, though the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;OK Go&quot; and &quot;Oh No&quot; remained catalog items of EMI. That night OK Go performed a single from its newly independent record on Late Night with Jimmy Kimmel. Now charting its own destiny as an independent entity, the band has attempted to plot a new course for itself, as Kulash puts it: &quot;We&#x27;re trying to be a DIY [do-it-yourself] band in a post-major label world.&quot;

The first wholly new release on the band&#x27;s label Paracadute Recordings was &quot;180/365&quot;, a live album recorded over several shows in 2010, mixed by producer Fridmann, and released on June 21, 2011. The album title refers to the number of concerts the band played in the course of one year. A stream of the album premiered on the technology website Mashable before its official street date.&lt;ref name=&quot;180/365/mashable&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate the release, the band printed and sold 200 signed copies of &quot;180/365: The Book&quot;, a limited-edition book of tour photographs by Nathaniel Wood that was made available only to purchasers of the album. The album was sold digitally and on CD in six-panel eco-friendly &quot;Tron Pack&quot; packaging from Norway.

In July 2012, the band partnered with the Humble Bundle for a pay-what-you-will release of the remix collection &quot;Twelve Remixes Of Four Songs&quot;, alongside titles from MC Frontalot, They Might Be Giants, Christopher Tin, Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Jonathan Coulton.

The band&#x27;s most successful example of its new business model was taking money from State Farm Insurance, which was looking to tap into a younger audience by creating a piece of interesting digital content. The band created a music video for &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot;, in which a toy truck with State Farm branding was used to start a large Rube Goldberg machine built in a warehouse. Released on March 1, 2010, the video quickly went viral, with 1.4 million YouTube views in the first 48 hours and over 50 million total views . Since that video, OK Go has employed a similar model in projects funded by Range Rover, Yahoo, Cisco, Samsung, Google Chrome, Jose Cuervo, and Chevrolet.

===&quot;Hungry Ghosts&quot; (2012–2019)===

In December 2012, OK Go released a collection of rare songs, B-sides and covers called &quot;Twelve Days of OK Go&quot;. The collection was released for free on the band&#x27;s website and includes covers of songs by the Beatles, They Might Be Giants, the Kinks, Adam and the Ants, and Pixies.

Following &quot;Twelve Days of OK Go&quot;, in January 2013 the band announced &quot;Twelve Months of OK Go&quot;, a free long-form release of new and rare recordings, B-sides, and covers. One song per month was distributed through the band&#x27;s email list and free MP3 web store. The collection includes covers of songs by the Breeders, the Specials, and Nelly. In March 2013, OK Go released a new single, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Through&quot;, through &quot;Twelve Months of OK Go&quot; and in partnership with advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for The Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Music Video Challenge.

On April 3, 2013, OK Go announced on its YouTube channel that the band was recording its fourth studio album. On May 6, 2014, OK Go announced that the album, &quot;Hungry Ghosts&quot;, would be released in October 2014. The album was made available for pre-order on the direct-to-fan platform, PledgeMusic. The first official single, &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; was released on June 17, 2014, along with a music video which received over 7 million views on YouTube within a week.

On October 14, 2014, &quot;Hungry Ghosts&quot; was released. Since then, the Pledge Music campaign has stopped. A music video for &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot; was released on October 27, 2014. In its first two weeks, the video hit 12 million views on YouTube. The video features a cameo from the J-pop band Perfume.

The video for &quot;Upside Down &amp; Inside Out&quot; was released on February 11, 2016, where the band perform the song while moving about in microgravity, with the aid of a reduced-gravity aircraft provided by the Russian S7 Airlines.

On July 20, 2016, OK Go released &quot;I Don&#x27;t Understand You,&quot; a stand-alone single that was a collaboration with Perfume, as ending theme of TOKYO MX 20th Anniversary Memorial TV Animation 3DCG short &#x27;SUshi Police&#x27; anime series.

On November 24, 2016, OK Go released the music video for &quot;The One Moment&quot;, featuring multiple seemingly unconnected events filmed in the span of a few seconds. The video is then slowed down to reveal each action being played in perfect synchronization with the song.

On November 23, 2017, OK Go released the music video for &quot;Obsession.&quot; 567 printers were used to create a multicolored backdrop in the video.

=== Pandemic activities and legal dispute (2020–2023) ===
In early 2020, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kulash and his wife fell ill with the 2019 novel coronavirus. After his recovery, while the band members were following stay-at-home orders at their homes, they wrote and recorded &quot;All Together Now&quot; and filmed a video for it over two months as a tribute to the healthcare workers battling the infection. The song and video were released on May 12, 2020; proceeds went to Partners in Health. The band uploaded several alternate music videos for &quot;All Together Now&quot; on YouTube, including clips sent to them by fans.

In early 2021, the band released an acoustic cover of &quot;This Will Be Our Year&quot; by the Zombies, which they also covered in 2004. 

In 2021, Kulash hinted in an interview that he might do another video in zero gravity for a future song similar to &quot;Upside Down and Inside Out.&quot;

In 2022 and early 2023, the band became involved in a legal dispute with Minnesota company Post Consumer Brands, which registered a trademark on the phrase &quot;OK Go!&quot; for a new line of portable breakfast cereals. A lawyer for the band cited a previous collaboration between OK Go and Post as evidence that the &quot;namejacking&quot; was most likely intentional. On May 31, 2023, OK Go and Post reached a settlement, which resulted in Post abandoning its registration of the &quot;OK Go!&quot; name.

=== &quot;And the Adjacent Possible&quot; (2024–present) ===
In late 2024, OK Go announced through their newsletter that they had finished recording their then-untitled fifth album. On October 1, 2024, OK Go posted a YouTube video in which they said the album would be released in early 2025. The video also described &quot;4 Flavors of OK Go&quot;, a series of Spotify playlists the band listened to while creating the album. The first playlist, &quot;Arty Party&quot;, was released the same day; the second, &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;, on November 11, 2024. 

On January 16, 2025, the band posted a music video for &quot;A Stone Only Rolls Downhill&quot;, the first song on the album, which is named&quot; And the Adjacent Possible&quot;.

==Videos==

OK Go has earned fame for its creative and often low-budget music videos, most of which have been promoted through Internet video sharing sites such as YouTube. Many of these have become viral; the 2006 video for &quot;Here It Goes Again&quot;, in which the band performed a complex routine on motorized treadmills, had received over 50 million views on YouTube four years later when EMI took it off the platform during a dispute with YouTube. The subsequent reposting had been viewed over 66 million times as of February 15, 2025. The band&#x27;s video for &quot;Needing/Getting&quot;, funded by Chevrolet and released February 5, 2012, debuted during Super Bowl XLVI and within the year received more than 47 million views on YouTube. Samuel Bayer, who produced many music videos in the 1990s, said that OK Go&#x27;s promotion of music videos on the Internet was akin to Nirvana&#x27;s ushering in the grunge movement. Many of the videos use long or single-shot takes, which &quot;Salon&quot;″s Matt Zoller Seitz claims &quot;restore[s] a sense of wonder to the musical number by letting the performers&#x27; humanity shine through and allowing them to do their thing with a minimum of filmmaking interference&quot;. OK Go won the 14th Annual Webby Special Achievement Award for Film and Video Artist of the Year. The video for &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot; was named both &quot;Video of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Rock Video&quot; at the 3rd annual UK Music Video Awards. &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot; won the LA Film Fest&#x27;s Audience Award for Best Music Video, UK MVA Awards – Music Video of the Year Winner 2010, among others.

The band has worked with directors including Francis Lawrence, Olivier Gondry (brother of Michel Gondry), Brian L. Perkins, Scott Keiner, and Todd Sullivan. The videos have been screened and displayed at museums, art galleries, and film festivals around the world including the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of the Moving Image, the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Los Angeles Film Festival, and the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New Director&#x27;s Showcase.

In 2008, Damian Kulash said that the band had not produced the music videos as part of any overt &quot;Machiavellian&quot; marketing campaign. &quot;In neither case did we think, &#x27;A-ha, this will get people to buy our records.&#x27; It has always been our position that the reason you wind up in a rock band is you want to make stuff. You want to do creative things for a living.&quot; On the release of the band&#x27;s video for &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; in 2014, Kulash explained to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the band continued to make such quirky videos following their success after &quot;Here It Goes Again&quot; because the band worried about being considered a one-hit wonder: &quot;We could go in two directions: We could either try to out-cool it – try to out-run it like Radiohead did with &#x27;Creep&#x27; – or just embrace it and go, OK, what really worked here.&quot;

==Other appearances==
&quot;Get Over It&quot; is featured in the EA Sports video games &quot;Triple Play 2002&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 2003&quot;, while a censored version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me&quot; is featured in &quot;MVP Baseball 2003&quot; and as background to the transitions in the British TV show &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot;.

Lead singer Damian Kulash wrote a how-to-guide entitled &quot;How Your Band Can Fire Bush&quot; for bands hoping to help unseat President George W. Bush.

After visiting New Orleans in 2006, the band recorded an EP with New Orleans funk rock band Bonerama, to raise money for musicians who were still displaced by the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. The EP, entitled &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;, was released on February 5, 2008.

In April 2010, OK Go collaborated with Brett Doar of Syyn Labs to build a speciality Rube Goldberg Machine called &quot;The Colbert Machine&quot; for the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. At the end of the episode, the band performed &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot; with host Stephen Colbert singing lead vocals. Later that year, the OK Go song &quot;Here It Goes Again&quot; was included in the soundtrack for the children&#x27;s film &quot;Ramona and Beezus&quot;.

In 2011, OK Go were featured in the meta-documentary &quot;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold&quot; by Morgan Spurlock with the song &quot;The Greatest Song I Ever Heard&quot;. In the film, Damian Kulash says: &quot;Does that mean... Hold on, if we make the theme for &quot;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold&quot;, does that mean that we&#x27;re the greatest rock band ever to write a theme song?&quot; whereby Spurlock responds: &quot;Absolutely.&quot;

On May 9, 2013, the band, through its label Paracadute, released &quot;Say the Same Thing&quot;, a collaborative word guessing game app for iOS and Android in which two players attempt to guess the same word, by finding common points between two random starting words. The app, which was created by guitarist Andy Ross during the band&#x27;s down time, is based on an improv game which the band plays together while on tour. The band advertised the app by releasing a comedic video that introduces and explains the game. On May 15, 2013, &quot;Say the Same Thing&quot; became the 50 billionth download in Apple&#x27;s App Store.

OK Go also contributed a song to the 2015 film &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine 2&quot;, titled &quot;You&#x27;re a Fucking Nerd and No One Likes You&quot;.

In February 2015, the band was featured in a segment created to help children learn colors in a premiere for &quot;The Cookie Thief&quot;, a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; movie special.

In March 2015, OK Go made a cameo appearance in the music video for &quot;Pick Me Up&quot; by Japanese electropop group Perfume, following Perfume&#x27;s cameo appearance at the beginning of OK Go&#x27;s &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot;.

The band composed a new original song titled &quot;This&quot; for the 2023 Apple TV movie &quot;The Beanie Bubble&quot;, directed by Kulash and his wife Kristin Gore. The single and associated video were released on July 21, 2023.

==Charity work==
In 2007, the band released &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;, a charity EP whose proceeds raised money for musicians displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The successful EP, which helped purchase a home for New Orleans musician Al &quot;Carnival Time&quot; Johnson, was the most public example of the band&#x27;s increasing interest in politics and social issues, as the campaign included promotional appearances on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; as well as charity concerts. Earlier examples of the band&#x27;s activism include a ten-page PDF titled &quot;How Your Band Can Fire Bush,&quot; which was written by Kulash and distributed on the band&#x27;s website. Other efforts have included direct appeals to fans of the band via the band&#x27;s email newsletter, auctioning themselves off on behalf of Sweet Relief Musician&#x27;s Fund, and the Burrito Project in which the group enlisted fans to join them in handing out burritos to homeless people before concerts. In Chicago, the band partnered with the Inspiration Corporation, a local provider of services to the homeless. The band has played several high-profile political and charity events, including a Super Tuesday Voter Awareness show hosted by Stella in 2008, and a star-studded benefit in Los Angeles led by Frank Black, and including &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Tenacious D, and others. Lead singer Damian Kulash has written op-eds in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on digital rights management and net neutrality, an issue he also testified about in front of the House Judiciary Antitrust Task Force about in March 2008, and also discussed with the FCC commissioner. The day after that meeting, it was announced that the Internet would be reclassified under Title 2 of the telecommunications act — one of the band&#x27;s short-term goals, which the band members nodded to in their five-word Webby acceptance speech: &quot;Fight for Net Neutrality now.&quot;

The band has also used the massive popularity of its videos to further its favored causes. Downloads of the &quot;White Knuckles&quot; video went to ASPCA and were earmarked for rural animal shelters, and the video itself ends with a call to support animal rescue. A marching band costume from &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot; was auctioned off to feed the homeless and eleven of the signed Gretsch guitars and amplifiers used in &quot;Needing/Getting&quot; were sold to benefit the Fender Music Foundation, which provides instruments to music education programs.

OK Go has also allowed its music on benefit albums, most notably &quot;Dear New Orleans,&quot; a 31-song online compilation that benefits a variety of New Orleans organizations. Lyrics from the band&#x27;s contribution, &quot;Louisiana Land&quot;, reference a number of New Orleans personalities and institutions, which the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot; called &quot;indicative of just how deeply the members of OK Go waded into the local gestalt.&quot; and the &quot;Future Soundtrack for America,&quot; a compilation released by Barsuk Records that benefited MoveOn.org and Music for America, which included OK Go&#x27;s cover of &quot;This Will Be Our Year&quot; by The Zombies.

On January 18, 2017, two days before Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, OK Go released a cover of the politically charged Morrissey song &quot;Interesting Drug&quot;. The music video includes images of Trump and other prominent political figures as bad people and ends with a list of organizations the band recommends viewers support. Fans of the band had mixed reactions, prompting this status update on OK GO&#x27;s Facebook page: &quot;Morrissey Official wrote this song almost 30 years ago but it seems truer to us now than ever. The comments we’ve gotten over the past day are fascinating. We especially applaud those who disagree with us without abandoning civility or respect. You give us hope.&quot;

In recent years, OK Go has worked on OK Go Sandbox to create music videos and educational tools with the Playful Learning Lab (a partnership with the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota).

<text>Binyamin &quot;Beny&quot; Alagem (; born 1953) is an Israeli-American entrepreneur, business executive, hotelier and philanthropist. He is the founder and former chief executive of Packard Bell Computers. He is the owner of the Beverly Hilton Hotel and the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills, California.

==Early life==
Beny Alagem was born in Israel. He was a tank driver. Alagem studied at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona where he met fellow Israeli immigrants Jason Barzilay and Alex Sandel. In 1983, Alagem would partner up with Sandel and Barzilay to start Cal-Abco, a wholesaler of computer parts. In 1986, all three then invested into creating Packard Bell. As of 1995, Cal-Abco was still intact and was listed in the Packard Bell prospectus as a supplier of parts to Packard Bell with a shared credit line between the two companies.

==Career==
Alagem founded Packard Bell, a personal computer manufacturer, in 1986. He served as its chief executive and president until 1998, when he resigned after he disagreed with NEC and Groupe Bull, the two other main shareholders. In January 1999, he acquired the rights to the AST Research name from Samsung.

Alagem serves as the chairman of the Alagem Capital Group, an asset management firm headquartered in Beverly Hills, California. In December 2003, Alagem purchased the Beverly Hilton Hotel from entertainer Merv Griffin for US$130 million through Oasis West Realty LLC, where he serves as chief executive officer. He proceeded to renovate it for an extra US$90 million. He oversaw the development of the Beverly Hills Waldorf Astoria with Guggenheim Partners, which was dedicated in 2017. Designed by the architectural firm Gensler, it is adjacent to the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills was the first new luxury hotel for the brand on the West Coast.

==Philanthropy==
Alagem was appointed an honorary ambassador of the City of Tel Aviv in 1995. He serves as an honorary member of the board of directors of the Israeli-American Council (IAC). Indeed, he has been described by &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; as one of the &quot;major donors&quot; to the IAC. For example, he underwrote the entire cost of the Council Leadership Gala on March 11, 2012. He also serves on the advisory board of the American Friends of The Citizens&#x27; Empowerment Center in Israel, a non-profit organization headquartered in Beverly Hills which promotes peace in Israel through research and education.

In 2004, Alagem held a fundraiser for the March of the Living, a non-profit organization which annual funds trips for 18,000 students to see the horror of the Auschwitz concentration camp, followed by trip to Israel on Independence Day. The event, which took place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel and was attended by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Israeli ministers Ehud Olmert and Avraham Hirschenson, raised US$1 million.

Alagem co-chaired a fundraiser for the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on December 17, 2009. It raised US$5.2 million for the Israel Defense Forces.

Alagem was the recipient of the Philanthropic Leadership Award from the board of governors of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in 2016.

==Personal life==
Alagem has a wife, Adele. They reside in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.

<text>&quot;In God We Trust&quot; (also rendered as &quot;In God we trust&quot;) is the official motto of the United States as well as the motto of the U.S. state of Florida, along with the nation of Nicaragua (Spanish: &quot;En Dios confiamos&quot;). It was adopted by the U.S. Congress in 1956, replacing (&quot;Out of many, one&quot;), which had been the &quot;de facto&quot; motto since the initial design of the Great Seal of the United States.

The fourth stanza of the U.S. national anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, adopted from the 1814 poem &quot;The Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;, contains the line: &quot;And this be our motto—&quot;In God is our trust&quot;&quot;. The origins of &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as a political motto lie in the American Civil War, where Union supporters wanted to emphasize their attachment to God and to boost morale. The capitalized form &quot;IN GOD WE TRUST&quot; first appeared on the two-cent piece in 1864 and initially only appeared on coins, but it gradually became accepted among Americans. Much wider adoption followed in the 1950s. The first postage stamps with the motto appeared in 1954. A law passed in July 1955 by a joint resolution of the 84th Congress () and approved by President Dwight Eisenhower requires that &quot;In God We Trust&quot; appear on all American currency. This law was first implemented on the updated one-dollar silver certificate that entered circulation on October 1, 1957. The 84th Congress later passed legislation (), also signed by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1956, declaring the phrase to be the national motto. Several states have also mandated or authorized its use in public institutions or schools; while Florida, Georgia and Mississippi have incorporated the phrase in some of their state symbols. The motto has also been used in some cases in other countries, most notably on Nicaragua&#x27;s coins.

The motto remains popular among the American public. According to a 2003 joint poll by &quot;USA Today&quot;, CNN, and Gallup, 90% of Americans support the inscription &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on U.S. coins; and a 2019 student poll by &quot;College Pulse&quot; showed that 53% of students supported its inclusion in currency. Some groups and people in the United States, however, have objected to its use, contending that its religious reference violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. These groups believe the phrase should be removed from currency and public property, which has resulted in numerous lawsuits. This argument has not overcome the interpretational doctrine of accommodationism and the notion of &quot;ceremonial deism&quot;. The former allows the government to endorse religious establishments as long as they are all treated equally, while the latter states that a repetitious invocation of a religious entity in ceremonial matters strips the phrase of its original religious connotation. The New Hampshire Supreme Court, as well as the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, have all upheld the constitutionality of the motto in various settings. The Supreme Court has discussed the motto in footnotes but has never directly ruled on its compliance with the U.S. constitution.

== Origins ==
The earliest recorded usage of the motto in English was in January 1748, when &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; reported on the colours of Associators regiments, namely that of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s Pennsylvania militia, one of which said: &quot;IX. A Coronet and Plume of Feathers. Motto, .&quot; According to Thomas S. Kidd, an American historian, this appears to be an isolated instance of an official usage, which could be traced to some renderings of .

The precise phrase, &quot;In God We Trust&quot; is also found in a publication of Isaac Watts&#x27; Psalter which was revised and printed in the United States in 1785. Watts had translated Psalm 115:9–11 with the words, &quot;Britain, trust the Lord.&quot; An American publisher, Joel Barlow, sought to revise Watts&#x27; Psalter for an American audience. Barlow&#x27;s goal was to modify Watts in such a way as to purge the un-American flavor. Barlow simply translated Psalm 115: 9–11 with the words &quot;In God we Trust.&quot;There were several other unrelated recordings of the motto. It can be encountered in some literary works of the early 19th century. One of them, &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot;, contained a version of the motto and subsequently became the national anthem of the United States. It also appeared in 1845, when D.S. Whitney published an anti-slavery hymn in &quot;The Liberator&quot;. Odd Fellows have also used the phrase as their motto from the 1840s at least into the 1870s.

== Motto on U.S. currency ==
=== Initial adoption ===
In a letter dated November 13, 1861, Rev. Mark R. Watkinson of Ridleyville, Pennsylvania (pastor of the Prospect Hill Baptist Church in present-day Prospect Park, Pennsylvania), petitioned the Treasury Department to add a statement recognizing &quot;Almighty God in some form on our coins&quot; in order to &quot;relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism&quot;. At least part of the motivation was to declare that God was on the Union side of the Civil War, given that the Confederacy&#x27;s constitution, unlike the Union&#x27;s, invoked God. This sentiment was shared by other citizens who supported such inclusion in their letters. Indeed, the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry for the Union Army assumed the motto &quot;In God we trust&quot; in early August 1862.

In the South, the phrase has also gained significant traction. A Confederate bunting with &quot;In God We Trust&quot; printed in the center, dated to late 1861 or early 1862 and attributed to the 37th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, was probably captured by the 33rd Iowa Infantry Regiment at the Battle of Helena and is currently in possession of the Iowa Historical Society. Another flag with exactly the same motto, this time of the 60th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, was captured in the course of the Battle of Big Black River Bridge. Additionally, in 1864, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; reported that the Union Navy had captured a flag whose motto said: &quot;Our cause is just, our duty we know; In God we trust, to battle we go.&quot; Other Confederate symbols included close paraphrasing of the motto, such as the banner of the Apalachicola Guard of Florida (&quot;In God is our trust&quot;) and &quot;The Star-Spangled Cross and the Pure Field of White&quot;, a popular song in the Southern military whose refrain contains the following passage: &quot;Our trust is in God, who can help us in fight, And defend those who ask Him in prayer.&quot;

President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, a lifelong evangelical Episcopalian who was known for his public shows of piety, acted swiftly on the proposal to include a motto referring to God and directed the then-Philadelphia Director of the Mint and member of the National Reform Association, James Pollock, to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase. Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to the Congress for the new designs in late 1863. He then decided on the final version of the new motto, &quot;In God We Trust,&quot; in December 1863. Walter H. Breen, a numismatist, wrote that Chase drew inspiration from the motto of Brown University of Providence, Rhode Island, &quot;In Deo speramus&quot;, which is Latin for a similarly sounding &quot;In God we hope&quot;. President Lincoln&#x27;s degree of involvement in the process of the motto&#x27;s approval is unclear, though he was aware of such talks.

As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the federal legislature passed a bill on January 18, 1837, which determined the mottos and devices that should be stamped on U.S. coins. This meant that enactment of some additional legislation was necessary before &quot;In God We Trust&quot; could be engraved. Such bill was introduced and passed as the Coinage Act of 1864 on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.

On March 3, 1865, the U.S. Congress passed a bill, which Lincoln subsequently signed as the last act of Congress prior to his assassination, that allowed the Mint Director to place &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on all gold and silver coins that &quot;shall admit the inscription thereon&quot;, subject to the Secretary&#x27;s approval. In 1873, Congress passed another Coinage Act, granting the Secretary of the Treasury the right to &quot;cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto&quot;.

In God We Trust (or, rarely, its variation, God We Trust) first appeared on 2¢ coins, which were first minted in 1863 and went into mass circulation the following year. According to David W. Lange, a numismatist, the inclusion of the motto on a coin was a major driver for the popularisation of the slogan. Other coins, that is, nickels, quarter dollars, half dollars, half eagles and eagles, have had In God We Trust engraved from 1866 on. Dollar coins got the motto in 1873 for trade dollars and 1878 for common circulation Morgan dollars. However, there was no obligation for the motto to be used, so some denominations still didn&#x27;t have it. Others, such as nickels, have seen the phrase disappear after a redesign, so that by the late 19th century, most of the coins did not bear the motto. Finally, in 1892, an oversight caused the Coinage Act to lose the language which mandated inclusion of the phrase. 

Banknotes did not have formal authorization, or mandate, to have &quot;In God We Trust&quot; engraved until 1955. However, a version of the motto (&quot;In God Is Our Trust&quot;) first made a brief appearance on the obverse side of the 1864 $20 interest-bearing and compound interest treasury notes, along with the motto &quot;God and our Right&quot;.

==== Reactions ====
The initial reaction of the general populace was far from unanimous approval. On the one hand, Christian newspapers were generally happy with the phrase being included in coins, though some advocated for more religiously connoted mottos, such as &quot;In God &quot;alone&quot; is our trust&quot; or &quot;God our Christ&quot;. On the other, non-religious press was less impressed by the developments. &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial board asked to &quot;let us try to carry our religion—such as it is—in our hearts, and not in our pockets&quot; and criticized the Mint for including the motto only on golden and larger silver coins. &quot;New York Illustrated News&quot; ridiculed the new coins for marking &quot;the first time that God has ever been recognized on any of our counters of Mammon,&quot; with a similar comparison made by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;. The different opinions on its inclusion eventually grew into a dispute between secularists and faith congregations. Others still started to make jokes of &quot;In God We Trust&quot;. The &quot;American Journal of Numismatics&quot; suggested that people would misread the motto as &quot;In Gold we Trust&quot;, which they said was &quot;much nearer the fact&quot;. Newspapers also started reporting on puns made of the slogan. Already in 1860s, newspapers reported signs reading &quot;In God we Trust – terms cash,&quot; &quot;In God we trust. All others are expected to pay cash&quot; and the like.

The phrase, however, gradually became a symbol of national pride. Just six years after it first appeared on coins, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;our nation&#x27;s motto&quot;; similarly, groups as diverse as prohibitionists and suffragists, pacifists and nativists, Democrats and Republicans, Christians and Jews all adopted the motto or endorsed its usage by the end of the 19th century. The motto stayed popular even as fewer denominations had &quot;In God We Trust&quot; embossed on coins.

=== 1907 Saint-Gaudens coins controversy ===
In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt sought to beautify American coinage and decided to give the task to his friend, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who, after several delays and technical issues with his design, produced a new design for eagles and double eagles. Roosevelt specifically instructed Saint-Gaudens not to include &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on the coins, as the President feared that these coins would be used to further ungodly activities, such as gambling, and facilitate crime. Saint-Gaudens did not oppose the order, as he thought that the phrase would distract from the coin&#x27;s design features.
The coin, whose ultra-high relief version is now considered one of the most beautiful coins ever struck in the U.S., was indeed appreciated for its esthetics by art critics. However, a scandal immediately erupted over the lack of &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on the eagles and double eagles. Theodore Roosevelt insisted that while he was in favor of placing the motto on public buildings and monuments, doing so for money (or postage stamps and advertisements) would be &quot;dangerously close to sacrilege&quot;:
Press response was largely negative. Most news outlets affiliated with Christian organisations, as well as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot; and other newspapers were critical of the decision, with accusations amounting to the President being guilty of premeditated assault on religion and disregard for Americans&#x27; religious sentiments. &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; wrote that people were to choose between &quot;God and Roosevelt&quot;, while &quot;The New York Sun&quot; published a poem mocking Roosevelt&#x27;s attitude. In contrast, &quot;The New York Times, Chicago Tribune&quot;, and some religious newspapers such as &quot;The Churchman&quot;, sided with the President, who was both stunned and irritated by people&#x27;s opposition to excluding the motto. This prompted debate in Congress, which quickly decided to reinstate the motto on the coins in an act adopted in 1908. As a result of controversy, relevant design changes were subsequently introduced by the Mint Chief Engraver, Charles E. Barber.

Other coins have also retained or renewed the usage of the motto. All gold coins and silver $1 coins, half dollars and quarters have had the motto engraved since July 1, 1908; pennies followed in 1909 and dimes in 1916. Since 1938, all U.S. coins have borne the &quot;In God We Trust&quot; inscription on them.

=== Road to universal mandate ===

It is generally thought that during the Cold War era, the government of the United States sought to distinguish itself from the Soviet Union, which promoted state atheism and thus implemented antireligious legislation, therefore, a debate for further usage of religious motto was started in Congress. Kevin M. Kruse offers an alternative explanation. In his book, he argues that conservative opposition to the New Deal, and those politicians&#x27; subsequent successful campaigns to expand the influence of religion, were the main factors that contributed to further adoption of &quot;In God We Trust&quot;.

The Eisenhower administration struck a deeply religious tone, which proved a fertile ground for lobbying for inclusion of the motto in more contexts. This is often attributed to the influence of Billy Graham, a prominent evangelist of the time. After intense public pressure for inclusion of the national motto, it appeared for the first time on some postage stamps of the 1954 Liberty Issue, though lobbying for universal inclusion by Michigan Senator Charles E. Potter and Representative Louis C. Rabaut failed.

The following year, Democratic Representative Charles Edward Bennett of Florida cited the Cold War when he introduced 619, which obliged &quot;In God we trust&quot; to be printed on all banknotes and struck on all coins, in the House, arguing that &quot;[in] these days when imperialistic and materialistic communism seeks to attack and destroy freedom, we should continually look for ways to strengthen the foundations of our freedom&quot;. The American Numismatic Association and the American Legion concurred and made resolutions urging to promote further usage of &quot;In God We Trust&quot;.

On July 11, 1955, the bill, having passed with bipartisan support of both chambers of Congress, was signed into law by President Eisenhower. Since all coins already complied with the law, the only changes were made to the paper currency. The motto first appeared on the $1 silver certificate in 1957, followed by other certificates. Federal Reserve Notes and United States Notes were circulated with the motto starting from 1964 to 1966, depending on the denomination.

== Adoption and display by government institutions in U.S. ==
=== Federal government ===
On July 30, 1956, the 84th Congress passed a joint resolution &quot;declaring &#x27;IN GOD WE TRUST&#x27; the national motto of the United States.&quot; The resolution passed both the House and the Senate unanimously and without debate. It replaced , which had existed before as a &quot;de facto&quot; official motto. The United States Code at , now states: &quot;&#x27;In God we trust&#x27; is the national motto.&quot; The resolution was reaffirmed in 2006, on the 50th anniversary of its adoption, by the Senate, and in 2011 by the House of Representatives, in a 396 to 9 vote. In 2000, the House additionally encouraged to publicly display the motto.

The House of Representatives features the motto above the rostrum of the Speaker, which was carved in the wall in December 1962 in response to the Supreme Court banning public school prayer in &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot;.
=== State and local governments ===

==== Adoption of the national motto in state symbols ====
In Florida, 1145 provided for the adoption of &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as the official state motto, instead of fairly similar &quot;In God Is Our Trust&quot;, effective July 1, 2006. The motto has also appeared on the seal of Florida and on the flag of Florida, as the seal is one of its elements, since 1868.

Georgia&#x27;s flag features the motto since 2001, which was retained after a redesign two years later.

In Mississippi, the Mississippi Senate voted to add the words, &quot;In God We Trust&quot; to the state seal, justifying it as an effort to protect religious freedom. The change was made effective on July 1, 2014. Six years later, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves signed into law a bill requiring that the state&#x27;s flag, which had contained the Confederate battle emblem, be replaced with a new one containing the phrase &quot;In God We Trust.&quot; A new flag containing the motto was approved by voters in a referendum, and it became the official state flag in January 2021.

On April 28, 2023, Governor Bill Lee of Tennessee signed a bill that would require him to submit a new state seal design which would include the national motto. The secretary of state should receive the proposal by July 1, 2025.

==== Mandating display ====
* Arkansas: In March 2017, Act 911, sponsored by state Representative Jim Dotson, made it a requirement of Arkansas state law for public schools to display posters with the national motto, if these were donated. In 2019, the law was later amended to require public display of the national motto in public schools, higher education institutions and state government buildings, if funds are available for that purpose.
* Florida: In early 2018, Kimberly Daniels, a Democrat who served as a representative for the Florida House of Representatives, introduced 839, a bill that requires public schools to display the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; in a conspicuous place. On February 21, 2018, the bill passed 97 to 10 in the House. Governor Rick Scott then signed the mandate into law.
* Idaho: House Concurrent Resolution 32, adopted in March 2020, mandates that the national motto be placed over the chairs of presiding officers of both chambers of Idaho Legislature.
* Kentucky: In 2014, a law was passed that obliged display of the national motto in legislative buildings and in committees. In June 2019, a bill sponsored by state Representative Brandon Reed of Hodgenville was passed that required Kentucky public schools to display the motto &quot;in a prominent location&quot;, beginning from the 2019–20 school year. To protest the requirement, Fayette County Public Schools, a school district which serves Lexington, complied by posting framed one-dollar bills, which bear the slogan, while in LaRue County, of which Hodgenville is seat, schools were using oversized images of pennies.
* Louisiana: A bill requiring public display of the motto in public schools was introduced by state Senator Regina Ashford Barrow in March 2018. It was passed unanimously both in the Senate (33 to 0) and in the House (93 to 0) and signed into law by Governor John Bel Edwards in May that year. The bill also mandated school instruction about &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as part of the social studies curriculum. The law was strengthened in August 2023 to require the motto to be hung in each classroom.
* Mississippi: In March 2001, Governor of Mississippi Ronnie Musgrove signed legislation requiring the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; to be displayed in every public school classroom, as well as the school auditoriums and cafeterias, throughout the state.
* Ohio: Ohio requires public schools to hang material featuring the motto if school districts receive it as donation, or if money is donated with the stated purpose of buying such materials.
* South Dakota: In March 2019, South Dakota required public schools to prominently display &quot;In God We Trust&quot; motto on their walls, starting from the 2019–20 school year.
* Tennessee: In March 2018, a bill sponsored by state Representative Susan Lynn, which requires Tennessee schools to prominently display &quot;In God We Trust&quot; passed the state House with 81 of the 99 members voting in favor of it. After being approved unanimously in the Senate, it was signed by Governor Bill Haslam into law the following month.
* Texas: Texas allowed display of the motto in public schools and higher education institutions since 2003. The Texas Legislature then passed a bill in 2021 to mandate donated copies of the motto to be hung in a &quot;conspicuous place&quot; in a collage that should, aside from the motto, also include the United States flag and the Texas flag, but nothing more. Two years later, another bill prohibited anyone from denying the possibility to hang such mottos.
* Virginia: A regulation that obliges all Virginia schools to publicly display the motto was signed into law in May 2002.
* Utah: Utah&#x27;s law to oblige schools to publicly display &quot;In God We Trust&quot; was signed into law in March 2002 by Governor Mike Leavitt. The law also mandates school instruction about the motto.

==== Allowing display ====
* Alabama: A 2018 law allows display of the motto in schools, libraries, government buildings, and on law enforcement vehicles.
* Arizona: Arizona allows public display of the motto in public schools.
* Georgia: Georgia allows for usage of the national motto in schools and government buildings, provided they have funds for pay for its display.
* Indiana: Indiana allows display of the national motto in public schools since 2005.
* Michigan: Michigan allows and encourages the display of the motto in and on public schools as well as state and local government buildings.
* New Hampshire: 69, introduced in April 2021, initially proposed to require schools to display the national and state motto&#x27;s, and passed the House 204–169. It was amended in the Senate to allow publication of the mottos and approved on May 13, 2021, which was approved by the House the following month. The bill was signed into law by Governor Chris Sununu on July 30, 2021.
* North Dakota: North Dakota statute allows display of the national motto in public schools.
* Oklahoma: A bill was passed in 2004 that allowed public schools to display &quot;In God We Trust&quot; and &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; in classrooms, auditoriums and cafeterias; a 2018 Senate bill to mandate such display died in the House.
* South Carolina: South Carolina allows political subdivisions and schools to post a display detailing the foundations of the American law and government, of which the national motto is one of thirteen documents, while providing context to these documents in terms detailed by the state statute.

In addition to that, several local governments have introduced the display of the motto in government buildings and municipal cars. School boards have also seen voluntary introduction of the motto, particularly after the September 11 attacks, when the American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to their display.

==Society and culture==

Multiple scholars have noted that &quot;In God We Trust&quot; motto is one of the main elements of civil religion in the United States.

===Religion===
In Judaism and Christianity, the official motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; is not found verbatim in any verses from the Bible, but the phrase is translated in similar terms in , in the Old Testament (&quot;I will say of the LORD, &quot;He is&quot; my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust&quot;) and in the New Testament in (&quot;Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver &quot;us&quot;.&quot;) The concept is paraphrased in , , , and . According to Philip Jenkins, a historian of religion, some Bible translations rendered Psalm 56:11 as &quot;In God I trust; I will not fear&quot;, which could lead to substitution of the first &quot;I&quot; for &quot;we&quot;.

In Islam the word for the concept of reliance on God is called ; the phrase &quot;In God We Trust&quot; is closely paraphrased in two places of the Quran, in &quot;surah&quot; Yunus (10:85), as well as &quot;surah&quot; Al-A&#x27;raf (7:89), and several other verses reinforce this concept. Melkote Ramaswamy, a Hindu American scholar, writes that the presence of the phrase &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on American currency is a reminder that &quot;there is God everywhere, whether we are conscious or not.&quot;

===License plates===
As of May 25, 2021, the following U.S. states currently offer an &quot;In God We Trust&quot; license plate (vanity and standard issues): Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Among the states that use the motto in standard issues, the Mississippi&#x27;s standard plate will feature the motto as displayed on its state seal until the end of 2023, when it will change to the design that does not contain the motto. Utah offers a standard option license plate with a seal. Florida, which also offers a specialty plate, has an option to place &quot;In God We Trust&quot; instead of the official state nickname or county name; Georgia also provides for such an option, while North Carolina offers an option with North Carolina&#x27;s state motto and &quot;In God We Trust&quot; instead of &quot;First in Flight&quot; or &quot;First in Freedom&quot;. In Tennessee, the 2022 issue license plates have two versions: with and without the national motto. As of March 2023, about 60% of the state&#x27;s license tags feature &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, but this falls to 21% in Davidson County, which includes the state capital, Nashville.

=== Opinion polls ===
According to a 2003 joint poll by &quot;USA Today&quot;, CNN, and Gallup, 90% of Americans support the inscription &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on U.S. coins. MSNBC launched a similar live survey online that ran for several years in the late 2000s and yielded overwhelming opposition to the removal of the motto. However, a more recent student poll in 2019 by &quot;College Pulse&quot; made for &quot;The College Fix&quot; showed that just over a half of students supports inclusion of the national motto in currency, with two-thirds of those who recognised themselves as Democrats opposing and 94% of Republicans in favor of the measure.

==Controversy==
&quot;In God We Trust&quot; has long been controversial as an official motto due to what opponents perceive as being a religious statement, and as such, violating the separation of church and state. Secular and atheist organizations, such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Freedom From Religion Foundation&quot;,&quot; as well as The Satanic Temple&quot;&quot; members, have all opposed inclusion of such motto. On the other hand, Project Blitz as well as conservative organizations and lawmakers have lobbied for its further adoption.

Proponents have extensively argued for inclusion of the national motto in more settings, grounding it in the traditional invocations of God that they say have now become an element of a civil religion and should express the will of the founders, who believed in God. Opponents, on the other hand, argue that not only does the motto violate the secular character of the United States, but it also predefines the type and number of gods (if any) to be trusted.

=== Litigation ===
The constitutionality of the phrase &quot;In God We Trust&quot; has been repeatedly upheld according to the judicial interpretation of accommodationism, whose adherents state that this entrenched practice has not historically presented any constitutional difficulty, is not coercive, and does not prefer one religious denomination over another. In &quot;Zorach v. Clauson&quot; (1952), the Supreme Court also wrote that the nation&#x27;s &quot;institutions presuppose a Supreme Being&quot; and that government recognition of God does not constitute the establishment of a state church as the U.S. constitution&#x27;s authors intended to prohibit. The courts also rely on the notion of &quot;ceremonial deism&quot; (as defined in Brennan&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Lynch v. Donnelly&quot;, 1984), i.e. that there exist religious references that, through their repetitious and customary usage, have become secular and are thus constitutional. While opponents of such rulings argue that Jefferson&#x27;s notion of a &quot;wall of separation between church and state&quot; prohibits any aid, direct or indirect, to any religious institution, and therefore any ruling to the contrary goes counter to Founders&#x27; intent, this separationist view has not gained significant ground in judicial settings.

Even though not directly related to the motto, &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; (1962) elicited much speculation on the future of &quot;In God We Trust&quot; in public settings. In the ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a New York law that encouraged public schools to recite a prayer as written in state law on First Amendment grounds. The ruling sparked widespread outrage and was extremely unpopular at the time, even as the judges&#x27; decision was near-unanimous. Almost 4/5 of Americans disapproved of the ruling, according to a Gallup poll. Congressmen were afraid that &quot;In God We Trust&quot; would have to disappear from coins and banknotes, the feeling shared by the then president of the American Bar Association, John C. Salterfield. Senator Sam Ervin, a Democrat from North Carolina, went so far as to wonder if God was declared unconstitutional by that decision. Congressmen tried to direct federal funds to buy Bibles for the Supreme Court justices and to propose a constitutional amendment allowing school prayer (both measures failed). A similar ruling the following year in &quot;Abington Township v. Schempp&quot; prompted senators to attempt to force the Supreme Court to hang the national motto in the courtroom, which also did not succeed.

Even though the Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the constitutionality of &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, several appellate federal courts and some state courts have, and the Supreme Court itself did not seem to have any problem with the phrase being inscribed on coins and banknotes.

&quot;Aronow v. United States&quot; (1970) was the first case to challenge the inclusion of &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on U.S. currency. The passage of the statute that the lawsuit challenged (&quot;the inscription &#x27;In God we Trust&#x27;...shall appear on all United States currency and coins&quot;, ) stood, and the Ninth Circuit stated that &quot;its [motto&#x27;s] use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise&quot;. In &quot;O&#x27;Hair v. Blumenthal&quot; (1978), the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas also upheld the law. A similar decision was reached on appeal to the Fifth Circuit in 1979, which affirmed that the &quot;primary purpose of the slogan was secular&quot;. The same decision was reached in &quot;Gaylor v. United States&quot; (1996) when it was appealed to the Tenth Circuit&quot;.&quot;

Michael Newdow then launched a series of lawsuits attempting to outlaw &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, with support of the Freedom From Religion Foundation. Newdow was known for his previous case &quot;Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow&quot; (2004), in which the Ninth Circuit issued a ruling removing &quot;under God&quot; from the Pledge of Allegiance (the ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court). A federal judge in California rejected his reasoning in a June 2006 ruling, as did the Ninth Circuit. Because the Supreme Court denied certiorari, the appellate court&#x27;s decision, which said that &quot;the national motto is of a &quot;patriotic or ceremonial character,&quot; has no &quot;theological or ritualistic impact,&quot; and does not constitute &quot;governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise,&quot;&quot; remained unchanged and in force. A lawsuit filed by Newdow and Freedom from Religion Foundation in 2013 in New York also failed, both on trial and on appeal to the Second Circuit; yet another one, filed in Ohio in 2016, was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and the Sixth Circuit. The same happened with the lawsuit in the Eighth Circuit, which was unrelated to Newdow&#x27;s efforts.

In 2015, David F. Bauman, a New Jersey state judge, dismissed a case against the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District brought by a student of the district and the American Humanist Association that argued that the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance created a climate of discrimination because it promoted religion, making non-believers &quot;second-class citizens&quot;. Bauman noted that &quot;as a matter of historical tradition, the words &#x27;under God&#x27; can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words &#x27;In God We Trust&#x27; from every coin in the land, than the words &#x27;so help me God&#x27; from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787.&quot;

Additionally, several courts have agreed that &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on public buildings did not violate the Establishment Clause: the New Hampshire Supreme Court (1967) and the Fourth Circuit (2005) did so for public schools, and the same appellate federal court argued the same for a county government office (2005).

Even though efforts to remove &quot;In God We Trust&quot; in most settings were largely fruitless, mandatory display of mottos in general on license plates drew some skepticism from the judiciary. In &quot;Wooley v. Maynard&quot; (1977), the Supreme Court struck down a New Hampshire law mandating that every person carry the state motto on their license plates. The Supreme Court noted in the case that the state can&#x27;t force its citizens to &quot;use their private property as a &#x27;mobile billboard&#x27; for the State&#x27;s ideological message&quot;. Applying &quot;Wooley&quot; in &quot;Griggs v. Graham&quot; (2023), a federal judge in Mississippi ruled that under the Free Speech Clause, the state may not force individuals to display &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as it appears on the state seal on their license plates (see above). The judge suggested that objectors to the statement may deface the part of the license tag containing it even though a Mississippi statute may arguably punish this behavior, but declined to order the state to issue religiously neutral license plates free of charge. In an unrelated development while the ruling was on appeal, Mississippi announced the winner of a design contest for the new standard plate, which did not include the motto. Atheist plaintiffs were satisfied and dropped the lawsuit in May that year.

The Supreme Court never decided a case challenging the constitutionality of &quot;In God we Trust&quot; as a national/state motto. But in &quot;obiter dicta&quot;, the majority of the Supreme Court in &quot;Wooley&quot; indicated they would reject the line of argument that the plaintiffs used in that case to declare the presence of the national motto on currency unconstitutional. They argued that unlike license plates, currency was not something that was either associated directly with the owner or made to display.

== Usage in other countries ==
The Spanish equivalent of &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, , is an unofficial motto of the Republic of Nicaragua. The phrase can be seen on most of Nicaragua&#x27;s coins. In 2023, Shas, a Haredi religious political party in Israel, proposed a bill that would order inclusion of &quot;In God we trust&quot; motto on banknotes, but it died in the Knesset.

Additionally, the phrase has been used in heraldic settings. In 1860, the phrase was included in the coat of arms of New Westminster, British Columbia, and it stayed there ever since. Until 1997 (though still traditionally remembered), the official heraldic motto of Brighton, England was the Latin equivalent of the phrase: .

<text>Hydrazones are a class of organic compounds with the structure . They are related to ketones and aldehydes by the replacement of the oxygen =O with the = functional group. They are formed usually by the action of hydrazine on ketones or aldehydes.

==Synthesis==
Hydrazine, organohydrazines, and 1,1-diorganohydrazines react with aldehydes and ketones to give hydrazones.

Phenylhydrazine reacts with reducing sugars to form hydrazones known as osazones, which was developed by German chemist Emil Fischer as a test to differentiate monosaccharides.

==Uses==

Hydrazones are the basis for various analyses of ketones and aldehydes. For example, dinitrophenylhydrazine coated onto a silica sorbent is the basis of an adsorption cartridge. The hydrazones are then eluted and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a UV detector.

The compound carbonyl cyanide-&quot;p&quot;-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (abbreviated as FCCP) is used to uncouple ATP synthesis and reduction of oxygen in oxidative phosphorylation in molecular biology.

Hydrazones are the basis of bioconjugation strategies. Hydrazone-based coupling methods are used in medical biotechnology to couple drugs to targeted antibodies (see ADC), e.g. antibodies against a certain type of cancer cell. The hydrazone-based bond is stable at neutral pH (in the blood), but is rapidly destroyed in the acidic environment of lysosomes of the cell. The drug is thereby released in the cell, where it exerts its function.

==Reactions==
Hydrazones are susceptible to hydrolysis:
Alkyl hydrazones are 102- to 103-fold more sensitive to hydrolysis than analogous oximes.

When derived from hydrazine itself, hydrazones condense with a second equivalent of a carbonyl to give azines:

Hydrazones are intermediates in the Wolff–Kishner reduction.

Hydrazones are reactants in hydrazone iodination, the Shapiro reaction, and the Bamford–Stevens reaction to vinyl compounds. Hydrazones can also be synthesized by the Japp–Klingemann reaction via β-keto acids or β-keto-esters and aryl diazonium salts. Hydrazones are converted to azines when used in the preparation of 3,5-disubstituted 1&quot;H&quot;-pyrazoles, a reaction also well known using hydrazine hydrate. With a transition metal catalyst, hydrazones can serve as organometallic reagent surrogates to react with various electrophiles.

==&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dialkylhydrazones==

In &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dialkylhydrazones the C=N bond can be hydrolysed, oxidised and reduced, the N–N bond can be reduced to the free amine. The carbon atom of the C=N bond can react with organometallic nucleophiles. The alpha-hydrogen atom is more acidic by 10 orders of magnitude compared to the ketone and therefore more nucleophilic. Deprotonation with for instance lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) gives an azaenolate which can be alkylated by alkyl halides. The hydrazines SAMP and RAMP function as chiral auxiliary.

== Recovery of carbonyl compounds from N,N-dialkylhydrazones ==
Several methods are known to recover carbonyl compounds from N,N-dialkylhydrazones. Procedures include oxidative, hydrolytic or reductive cleavage conditions and can be compatible with a wide range of functional groups.

<doc id="324404" wikidata="Q1050551" url="?curid=324404" title="IMesh">
<text>iMesh was a media and file sharing client that was available in nine languages. It used a proprietary, centralized, P2P network (IM2Net) operating on ports 80, 443 and 1863. iMesh was owned by American company iMesh, Inc., who maintained development centers around the world. , it was the third most popular music subscription service in the US.

iMesh operated the first &quot;RIAA-approved&quot; P2P service, allowing users residing in the United States and Canada to download music content of choice for a monthly fee in the form of either a Premium subscription or a &quot;ToGo&quot; subscription. This subscription-based approach is advocated by theories such as the Open Music Model. A third option was also available for users (residing in either country) to permanently purchase tracks for 99 cents (USD) each, without a subscription.

In September 2013, the website of iMesh was hacked and approximately 50M accounts were exposed. The data was later put up for sale on a dark market website in mid-2016 and included email and IP addresses, usernames and salted MD5 hashes.

==Shutdown==

On June 9, 2016, iMesh shut down their service without prior notification. Their top-level web page was changed to read &quot;We are sad to inform you that iMesh is no longer available.&quot; Their Support page was changed to read &quot;Due to changes in the music industry we regret to inform you that iMesh will no longer be available for download, and will no longer sell subscriptions or music tracks.&quot; They posted to their Facebook page: &quot;After many years of wonderful music, iMesh is no longer available. Thank you for listening with us. Stay tuned for our next adventure.&quot; Multiple Facebook users commented on the post to express frustration that they had no way to contact friends made via the iMesh social networking features.

==Legal aspects==

===RIAA lawsuit===
On September 18, 2003 the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) sued iMesh for encouraging copyright infringement. iMesh settled the lawsuit a little over 10 months later on July 20, 2004, where according to the RIAA, the terms of the settlement were that iMesh would pay them US$4.1 million and could continue operating as normal (unlike Grokster) while implementing a paid service (iMesh 6.0). iMesh had first agreed to have the new service available by the end of 2004, but this was pushed back towards the end of 2005 due to technicalities.

===Legality===
After the relaunch, iMesh was advertised as a 100% legal P2P client, and acknowledged as being so by the RIAA. This was because downloads through the client were limited to a select database of 15 million licensed songs and videos.

The iMesh 6 client (and later versions) achieved this by detecting attempts to download copyrighted material and blocking the transfer through the use of acoustic fingerprinting, provided by content protection company Audible Magic.

An agreement with the MPAA had also been reached. Video files more than 50 MB in size and 15 minutes in length could no longer be shared on the iMesh network, ensuring feature-length releases would not be transferred across the network.

<doc id="324406" wikidata="Q2891993" url="?curid=324406" title="Jane Stanford">
<text>Jane Elizabeth Lathrop Stanford (August 25, 1828 – February 28, 1905) was an American philanthropist and co-founder of Stanford University in 1885 (opened 1891), along with her husband, Leland Stanford, in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who died of typhoid fever at age 15 in 1884. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1893, she funded and operated the university almost single-handedly until her unsolved murder by strychnine poisoning in 1905.

She was the eighth First Lady of California. Her husband served as governor from January 10, 1862 to December 10, 1863.

==Early life==

Born Jane Elizabeth Lathrop in Albany, New York, she was the daughter of shopkeeper Dyer Lathrop and Jane Anne (Shields) Lathrop. She attended The Albany Academy for Girls, the longest-running girls&#x27; day school in the country. She was the second of six siblings:

* Daniel Shields Lathrop (1825–1883)
* Jane Elizabeth Lathrop (8/25/1828-2/28/1905)
* Ariel (1830–1908)
* Anna Maria Lathrop (9/3/1832 – 8/3/1892) (married David Hewes)
* Henry Clay Lathrop (5/20/1844 – 4/3/1899)
* Charles Gardner Lathrop (5/11/1849 – 5/24/1914)

==Marriage==
She married Leland Stanford on September 30, 1850.

The Stanfords lived in Port Washington, Wisconsin until 1852, when Leland Stanford&#x27;s law library and other property were lost to fire; they then returned to Albany, New York. Leland Stanford went to California to join his brothers in mercantile businesses related to the California Gold Rush, and Jane remained in Albany with her family. He returned in 1855, and the following year, they moved to San Francisco, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits on a large scale. Leland Stanford was a co-founder of the Central Pacific Railroad and served as its president from 1861 until his death in 1893. Leland Stanford was president of the Southern Pacific Railroad, served as governor of California from 1862 to 1863, and was a United States senator from California from 1885 until his death in 1893.

On May 14, 1868, Jane Stanford gave birth to a son, Leland Stanford, Jr., at age 39. He died at age 15 on March 13, 1884, of typhoid fever while the family was in Florence, Italy.

==Stanford University==
Following their son&#x27;s death, Jane and Leland Stanford sought ways to memorialize him. Before they left Europe in April 1884, with his remains, they changed their wills to give everything to a proposed institution at Palo Alto. In November 1885, they created foundational plans for the Leland Stanford Junior University, which opened on October 1, 1891. After her husband&#x27;s death on June 21, 1893, Jane Stanford effectively took control of the university. The university struggled financially in this period and the trustees advocated a temporary closure of the university until tax and legal issues could be resolved. From 1893 to 1898, she collected $10,000 per month from the university, as its co-founder. The estate left probate in 1898. As the remaining founder, she wielded a great deal of legal control over the university until her death.

It was at her direction that Stanford University gained an early focus on the arts. She also advocated for the admission of women; the university had been co-educational since its founding. She took a strong position on the issue of academic freedom when she sought and ultimately succeeded in having Stanford University economist Edward A. Ross fired. Ross had made speeches favoring the Democrat William Jennings Bryan, had collectivist economic teachings, favored racism against Chinese American &quot;coolies&quot;, and outlined eugenics policies directed against Chinese people and other racial groups.

She traveled to London in 1897, the year of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, in hopes of selling her rubies and other jewels to raise funds for the university, but was disappointed in the prices offered and returned home with most of her jewelry intact. In 1905, Jane Stanford directed the university trustees to sell her jewels after her death and use the funds as a permanent endowment &quot;to be used exclusively for the purchase of books and other publications&quot;. The board of trustees confirmed that arrangement, and the Jewel Fund continues to add to the university&#x27;s library collections. The endowment, originally $500,000, is now worth about $20 million. Items purchased through the Jewel Fund display a distinctive bookplate that depicts a romanticized Jane Stanford offering her jewels to Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom. Since 2007, benefactors who provide endowments for library acquisitions are referred to as members of the Jewel Society.

==Death==
In 1905, she died in Hawaii, where she had traveled after a failed poisoning attempt in San Francisco. The verdict in Hawaii was that she had died of strychnine poisoning. However, David Starr Jordan, the then-president of Stanford, immediately went to Hawaii, where he suppressed the report of poisoning and insisted that she had died of natural causes. His coverup was accepted as the truth for decades.

On January 14, 1905, at her Nob Hill mansion in San Francisco, Stanford consumed mineral water that tasted bitter. She quickly forced herself to vomit the water with prompting from and assistance by her maid, and when both the maid and her secretary agreed that the bottled water tasted strange, she sent it to a pharmacy to be analyzed. The findings, returned a few weeks later, showed that the water had been poisoned with a lethal dose of strychnine. Stanford moved out of her mansion and vowed never to return. Elizabeth Richmond, the maid, fell under suspicion and was dismissed. (Richmond had worked in Britain and had reportedly regaled Stanford&#x27;s domestic staff with tales of English aristocrats being poisoned by their servants.)

The Harry Morse Detective and Patrol Agency was retained for a discreet investigation of the incident. Its detectives put Richmond under surveillance and scoured records of Bay Area pharmacies for possibly-suspicious purchases of strychnine but found none. The agency learned that the mansion was a hothouse of petty staff jealousies, graft, and intrigue, but it could not come up with evidence pointing to a culprit or a motive for an attempted murder. Depressed by the conviction that an unknown party had tried to kill her and suffering from a cold, Stanford soon decided to sail to Hawaii, with plans to continue on to Japan. The Stanford party left San Francisco for Honolulu on February 15, 1905.

At the Moana Hotel on the island of Oahu on the evening of February 28, Stanford asked for bicarbonate of soda to settle her stomach while in her room. Her personal secretary, Bertha Berner (a trusted employee of 20 years&#x27; standing and the only other person present who had also been at the scene of the previous incident), prepared the solution, which Stanford drank. At 11:15 p.m., Stanford cried out for her servants and hotel staff to call for a physician, declared that she had lost control of her body, and believed that she had been poisoned again. This time, attempts to induce vomiting were unsuccessful. Robert Cutler, a retired Stanford neurologist, recounted in &quot;The Mysterious Death of Jane Stanford&quot; what took place upon the arrival of Francis Howard Humphris, the hotel physician:
As Humphris tried to administer a solution of bromine and chloral hydrate, Mrs. Stanford, now in anguish, exclaimed, &#x27;My jaws are stiff. This is a horrible death to die.&#x27; Whereupon she was seized by a tetanic spasm that progressed relentlessly to a state of severe rigidity: her jaws clamped shut, her thighs opened widely, her feet twisted inwards, her fingers and thumbs clenched into tight fists, and her head drew back. Finally, her respiration ceased. Stanford was dead from strychnine poisoning.
The &quot;San Francisco Evening Bulletin&quot; trumpeted the news with the March 1 headline &quot;Mrs. Stanford Dies, Poisoned.&quot; Forensic chemical analysis revealed the presence of a pure form of strychnine in samples from the bicarbonate she had taken, as well as traces of the poison in her tissues. After hearing three days of testimony, the coroner&#x27;s jury concluded in less than two minutes that she had died of strychnine &quot;introduced into a bottle of bicarbonate of soda with felonious intent by some person or persons to this jury unknown.&quot; The testimony revealed that the bottle in question had been purchased in California (after Richmond had been let go), had been accessible to anyone in Stanford&#x27;s residence during the period when her party was packing, and had not been used until the night of her death.

The jury&#x27;s quick verdict was to prove controversial. A March 11, 1905, dispatch in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the verdict was &quot;written out with the knowledge and assistance of Deputy High Sheriff Rawlins&quot; and implied that the jurors had been coached on the conclusion to reach. The controversy was largely stoked by Stanford University President David Starr Jordan, who had sailed to Hawaii himself and hired a local doctor, Ernest Coniston Waterhouse, to dispute poisoning as the cause of death. He then reported to the press that Stanford had in fact died of heart failure, a &quot;medically preposterous&quot; diagnosis given the dramatic and highly distinctive symptoms of strychnine poisoning that she had displayed.

In his book, Cutler concluded, &quot;There is ample evidence that Mrs. Stanford was poisoned, that she was given good care, and that Jordan went over there to hush it up.&quot; Stanford had long had a difficult relationship with Jordan. At the time of her death, she was president of the university&#x27;s board of trustees and was reportedly planning to remove him from his position.

Jordan&#x27;s motives for involvement in the case are uncertain, but he had written to the new president of Stanford&#x27;s board of trustees, offered several alternate explanations for Jane Stanford&#x27;s death, and suggested to select whichever would be most suitable. The university leadership may have believed that avoiding the appearance of scandal was of overriding importance. The coverup succeeded so well that the likelihood that she was murdered was largely overlooked by historians and commentators until the 1980s. In 2022, Stanford University historian Richard White concluded that Stanford was likely poisoned by her employee Bertha Berner, who was the only person present at both poisonings. White concludes that the first poisoning may have been intended to be non fatal and that Jordan and the San Francisco Police likely suspected Berner but covered up the murder to suit their own interests.

The source of the strychnine was never identified. Stanford was buried alongside her husband, Leland, and their son at the Stanford family mausoleum on the Stanford campus.

==Recognition==

Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School in the Palo Alto Unified School District was named after her in 1985. The town of Lathrop, California in San Joaquin County was developed by her husband&#x27;s railroad company in the late 1860s and named after Jane and her brother Charles Lathrop.

<text>Caribbean stud poker, also called casino stud poker, is a casino table game with rules derived from five-card stud poker. However, unlike standard poker games, Caribbean stud poker is played against the house rather than against other players. There is no option to bluff or deceive as this is played against the house and not other players.

==History==
As a result of the popularity of poker, casinos created house-banked games in order to entice poker fans to play more table games. The birth of the game is not well recorded, which is unusual for a relatively new game. Professional poker player David Sklansky has claimed that he invented the game in 1982 using the name “Casino Poker”. This early version had some differences, for example the dealer having two cards revealed instead of only one. Likewise, there was no progressive jackpot in the game he allegedly founded. Due to patent laws, Sklansky was allegedly unable to patent &quot;Casino Poker&quot;. A few years afterwards he was approached by a poker player who brought the game to The King International Casino in Aruba (now known as the Excelsior Casino) and had it patented. The rules were shifted slightly to create current Caribbean stud poker.

==Rules==
The following rules are typical of play in U.S. casinos, but some of the details, such as payouts and betting limits, vary by location.

To play, each player places their ante on a marked spot on the table playing surface (&quot;the layout&quot;); all ante wagers must be placed prior to the dealer announcing &quot;no more bets&quot;. Each player also has the option to participate in the progressive jackpot feature of the game. This is also done before the dealer announces, &quot;no more bets&quot;, usually in a separate marked area. Each player and the dealer will then receive five cards, face down. The dealer will turn over one of his cards, after which the players may look at their cards.

Players have the option to either play or fold. Any player choosing to play places their raise, an additional wager equal to twice the amount of the ante, into the box marked &quot;Bet&quot;. Any player who chooses to fold forfeits their ante. After all the players have made their decisions, the dealer reveals their four face down cards. The dealer only &quot;qualifies&quot; (plays) if his hand either contains both an ace and a king or forms a pair or any higher-ranked poker hand. The dealer then compares his five-card hand to those of the other players, individually, and both the ante and the raise bets of all players whose hands beat the dealer&#x27;s qualified hand win. If they do not beat the dealer&#x27;s hand, they lose both the ante and the raise wager. If a player ties with the dealer, both ante and raise bets push (return to their respective players with no additional money won). If the dealer&#x27;s hand does not qualify, the ante bets of players get paid even money while the respective raise bets all push.

In the United Kingdom, the game is officially known as &quot;Casino Five Card stud poker&quot;, and not all casinos have the jackpot prize. Those who do have the prize, usually the large chain groups, officially call the game &quot;Casino Jackpot Five Card stud poker&quot;. In both instances, the game is commonly referred to as &quot;Casino stud poker&quot;.

The basic rules are the same in the UK as the US, although the payouts differ – the maximum bet is generally £100 on the ante and £200 on the raise, and all payouts are paid on the raise, meaning the maximum payout can potentially be £10,000 (a Royal Flush pays at the same odds, 50:1, as a Straight Flush). If the dealer does not show an Ace/King, hands playing the jackpot must be turned over, face up, and shown to the dealer and table. If the player is not playing the jackpot prize, the cards are not shown.

===Payout===
If a player&#x27;s cards beat the dealer&#x27;s cards, the player will receive even money (1-1) on the ante, and the following on their bet (with a maximum payout of $5,000 U.S. Dollars per hand on each bet wager):

Progressive jackpot payouts typically follow:

<doc id="324412" wikidata="Q422642" url="?curid=324412" title="Chromic acid">
<text>Chromic acid is jargon for a solution formed by the addition of sulfuric acid to aqueous solutions of dichromate. It consists at least in part of chromium trioxide.

The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (and a valence of VI or 6). It is a strong and corrosive oxidizing agent and a moderate carcinogen.

==Molecular chromic acid==
Molecular chromic acid, , in principle, resembles sulfuric acid, . It would ionize accordingly:

The p&quot;K&quot;a for the equilibrium is not well characterized. Reported values vary between about −0.8 to 1.6. The structure of the mono anion has been determined by X-ray crystallography. In this tetrahedral oxyanion, three Cr-O bond lengths are 156 pm and the Cr-OH bond is 201 pm

 condenses to form dichromate:
:, log&quot;K&quot;D = 2.05.
Furthermore, the dichromate can be protonated:
:, p&quot;K&quot;a = 1.8
Loss of the second proton occurs in the pH range 4–8, making the ion a weak acid.

Molecular chromic acid could in principle be made by adding chromium trioxide to water (&quot;cf.&quot; manufacture of sulfuric acid).

In practice, the reverse reaction occurs: molecular chromic acid dehydrates. Some insights can be gleaned from observations on the reaction of dichromate solutions with sulfuric acid. The first colour change from orange to red signals the conversion of dichromate to chromic acid. Under these conditions deep red crystals of chromium trioxide precipitate from the mixture, without further colour change.

Chromium trioxide is the anhydride of molecular chromic acid. It is a Lewis acid and can react with a Lewis base, such as pyridine in a non-aqueous medium such as dichloromethane (Collins reagent).
Higher chromic acids with the formula are probable components of concentrated solutions of chromic acid.

==Uses==
Chromic acid is an intermediate in chromium plating, and is also used in ceramic glazes, and colored glass. Because a solution of chromic acid in sulfuric acid (also known as a sulfochromic mixture or chromosulfuric acid) is a powerful oxidizing agent, it can be used to clean laboratory glassware, particularly of otherwise insoluble organic residues. This application has declined due to environmental concerns. Furthermore, the acid leaves trace amounts of paramagnetic chromic ions () that can interfere with certain applications, such as NMR spectroscopy. This is especially the case for NMR tubes. Piranha solution can be used for the same task, without leaving metallic residues behind.

Chromic acid was widely used in the musical instrument repair industry, due to its ability to &quot;brighten&quot; raw brass. A chromic acid dip leaves behind a bright yellow patina on the brass. Due to growing health and environmental concerns, many have discontinued use of this chemical in their repair shops.

It was used in hair dye in the 1940s, under the name &quot;Melereon&quot;.

It is used as a bleach in processing black and white photographic reversal film.

==Reactions==
Chromic acid is capable of oxidizing many kinds of organic compounds and many variations on this reagent have been developed:
* Chromic acid in aqueous sulfuric acid and acetone is known as the Jones reagent, which will oxidize primary and secondary alcohols to carboxylic acids and ketones respectively, while rarely affecting unsaturated bonds.
* Pyridinium chlorochromate is generated from chromium trioxide and pyridinium chloride. This reagent converts primary alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes (R–CHO).
* Collins reagent is an adduct of chromium trioxide and pyridine used for diverse oxidations.
* Chromyl chloride, is a well-defined molecular compound that is generated from chromic acid.

===Illustrative transformations===
* Oxidation of methylbenzenes to benzoic acids.
* Oxidative scission of indene to homophthalic acid.
* Oxidation of secondary alcohol to ketone (cyclooctanone) and .

===Use in qualitative organic analysis===
In organic chemistry, dilute solutions of chromic acid can be used to oxidize primary or secondary alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes and ketones. Similarly, it can also be used to oxidize an aldehyde to its corresponding carboxylic acid. Tertiary alcohols and ketones are unaffected. Because the oxidation is signaled by a color change from orange to brownish green (indicating chromium being reduced from oxidation state +6 to +3), chromic acid is commonly used as a lab reagent in high school or undergraduate college chemistry as a qualitative analytical test for the presence of primary or secondary alcohols, or aldehydes.

===Alternative reagents===
In oxidations of alcohols or aldehydes into carboxylic acids, chromic acid is one of several reagents, including several that are catalytic. For example, nickel(II) salts catalyze oxidations by bleach (hypochlorite). Aldehydes are relatively easily oxidized to carboxylic acids, and mild oxidizing agents are sufficient. Silver(I) compounds have been used for this purpose. Each oxidant offers advantages and disadvantages. Instead of using chemical oxidants, electrochemical oxidation is often possible.

==Safety==
Hexavalent chromium compounds (including chromium trioxide, chromic acids, chromates, chlorochromates) are toxic and carcinogenic. Chromium trioxide and chromic acids are strong oxidizers and may react violently if mixed with easily oxidizable organic substances.

Chromic acid burns are treated with a dilute sodium thiosulfate solution.

<text>Juan Ramón Jiménez Mantecón (; 23 December 1881 – 29 May 1958) was a Spanish poet, a prolific writer who received the 1956 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his lyrical poetry, which in the Spanish language constitutes an example of high spirit and artistic purity&quot;. One of Jiménez&#x27;s most important contributions to modern poetry was his advocacy of the concept of &quot;pure poetry&quot;.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Juan Ramón Jiménez was born in Moguer, near Huelva, in Andalucia, on 23 December 1881. He was educated in the Jesuit institution of San Luis Gonzaga, in El Puerto de Santa María, near Cadiz. Later, he studied law and painting at the University of Seville, but he soon discovered that his talents were better used for writing. He then dedicated himself to literature, under the influence of Rubén Darío and French symbolism. He published his first two books at the age of eighteen, in 1900. The death of his father the same year devastated him, and a resulting depression led to his being sent first to France, where he had an affair with his doctor&#x27;s wife, and then to a sanatorium in Madrid staffed by novice nuns, where he lived from 1901 to 1903. 

In about 1904 Jiménez was hoodwinked by some Peruvians. José Gálvez, Carlos Rodríguez Hübner and a 15 year old Maria Isabel Sanchez-Concha created a fictional woman named Georgina Hübner and they started a correspondence with the poet. José and Carlos were hoping to get access to his writing and Sanchez-Concha did the writing. Jiménez fell in love with their creation and planned to travel to Peru to meet the young woman. The plan was only aborted by a telegram they arranged via the Spanish consul to the poet, giving him the fabricated news of Georgina&#x27;s death.

=== Career ===
He was among the contributors of the Madrid-based avant-garde magazine &quot;Prometeo&quot; between 1908 and 1912. In 1911 and 1912, he wrote many erotic poems depicting romps with numerous women in numerous locales. Some of them alluded to sex with novices who were nurses. Eventually, apparently, their mother superior discovered the activity and expelled him, although it is not known whether the sexual activity described in his poems actually occurred. 

The main subjects of many of his other poems were music and color, which, at times, he compared to love or lust.

He suffered a mental breakdown and depression, so he stayed hospitalised in France and Madrid. He celebrated his home region in his prose poem about a writer and his donkey called &quot;Platero and I&quot; (1914). In 1916 he and Spanish-born writer and poet Zenobia Camprubí were married in the United States. Zenobia became his indispensable companion and collaborator.

Upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he and Zenobia went into exile in Puerto Rico, where he settled in 1946. Jiménez was hospitalized for eight months due to another deep depression. He later became a Professor of Spanish Language and Literature at the University of Puerto Rico. His literary influence on Puerto Rican writers strongly marks the works of Giannina Braschi, René Marqués, Aurora de Albornoz, and Manuel Ramos Otero. The university named a building on campus and a writing program in his honor. He was also a professor at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. While living in Coral Gables he wrote &quot;Romances de Coral Gables&quot;. In addition, he was a professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Maryland, which renamed Jimenez Hall for him in 1981.

Although he was primarily a poet, Jiménez&#x27; prose work &quot;Platero y yo&quot; (1917; &quot;Platero and I&quot;; Platero is a donkey) sold well in Latin America and in translation won him popularity in the USA. He also collaborated with his wife in the translation of the Irish playwright John Millington Synge&#x27;s &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; (1920). His poetic output during his life was immense.

Among his better known works are:

* &quot;Sonetos espirituales 1914–1916&quot; (1916; “Spiritual Sonnets, 1914–15”)
* &quot;Piedra y cielo&quot; (1919; “Stones and Sky”)
* &quot;Poesía en verso&quot;, 1917–1923 (1923; “Poetry in Verse”)
* &quot;Poesía en prosa y verso&quot; (1932; “Poetry in Prose and Verse”)
* &quot;Voces de mi copla&quot; (1945; “Voices of My Song”), and
* &quot;Animal de fondo&quot; (1947; “Animal at Bottom”). 

Both Jiménez and Camprubí used a simplified Spanish orthography different from the RAE standard.
A collection of 300 poems (1903–53) in English translation by Eloise Roach was published in 1962.

=== Later life and death ===
In 1956, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature; two days later, his wife died of ovarian cancer. Jiménez never recovered from the emotional devastation, and he died two years afterwards, on 29 May 1958, in the same clinic where his wife had died. Both are buried in his hometown of Moguer, Spain.

==In popular culture==

*A quotation from Jiménez, &quot;If they give you ruled paper, write the other way,&quot; is the epigraph to Ray Bradbury&#x27;s novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1953).
*The same quotation used in Fahrenheit 451 is used in &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; (2002) by Alice Sebold.
* In 1968, the Spanish film director Alfredo Castellón adapted Jiménez&#x27;s novel &quot;Platero and I&quot; into a movie by the same title.
* The Spanglish novel &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; (1998) by the Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi features a scene in which poets and artists debate Jiménez&#x27;s genius versus that of other Spanish-language poets Francisco de Quevedo, Luis de Góngora, Rubén Darío, Pablo Neruda, Federico García Lorca, and Julia de Burgos.
* A rock band in Spain is named Platero y Tú after Jiménez&#x27;s novel

==Streets named after Jiménez==
Several streets have been named after Jiménez, including one in Madrid and one in Valencia.

<doc id="324415" wikidata="Q7715421" url="?curid=324415" title="The Ballad of Halo Jones">
<text>The Ballad of Halo Jones is a science fiction comic strip written by Alan Moore and drawn by Ian Gibson, with lettering by Steve Potter (Books 1 &amp; 2) and Richard Starkings (Book 3).

&quot;Halo Jones&quot; first appeared July 1984 in five-page instalments in the pages of the weekly British comic &quot;2000 AD&quot; and is regarded as one of the high points of &quot;2000 AD&quot;. The eponymous heroine is a highly sympathetic 50th-century everywoman, and the tone of the strip ranges from the comic to the poignant. The three &quot;books&quot; span more than ten years of her life, and also serve as a tour of the well-realised futuristic universe which Moore and Gibson created. Originally, &quot;Halo Jones&quot; was planned to run to nine books, chronicling Halo&#x27;s life from adolescence to old age. However, the series was discontinued after three books due to a dispute between Moore and Fleetway, the magazine&#x27;s publishers, over the intellectual property rights of the characters Moore and Gibson had co-created.

==Synopsis==

In Book One, 18-year-old Halo Jones lives in a floating ring-shaped conurbation or housing estate called &quot;The Hoop&quot; that is moored in the Atlantic Ocean off the East coast of America. The story takes place over one day, and follows Halo&#x27;s violent though also partly comical misadventures on a shopping trip. Finally returning to her apartment, Halo finds her flatmate and best friend Brinna murdered, then discovers another good friend has become a &quot;Different Drummer&quot; (a youth cult perpetually numbed by the implant-generated beat of a drum in their ears). She decides to leave Earth, never to return.

Book Two depicts Halo&#x27;s life as a stewardess on a year-long space voyage. Halo discovers that it was her loyal robot dog Toby, harbouring a perverse crush on Halo, who was responsible for her flatmate&#x27;s death and is forced to destroy him. It is also revealed, in a framing sequence, that Halo becomes a legendary historical figure in centuries to come.

In Book Three, ten years have elapsed and Halo has become a soldier serving in a Vietnam-style guerrilla interstellar war which has appeared as back-story in the previous two books, and is courted by a famous general, Luiz Cannibal. The series ends with the cessation of hostilities, after which Halo commandeers a spaceship and deserts, determined to take charge of her own fate.

==Locations and characters==
* The Hoop (ghetto for &quot;increased-leisure citizens&quot;, a euphemism for the unemployed) tethered to the Manhattan peninsula: Halo Jones, Rodice Andelia Olsun, Brinna Childresse-Lao, Ludy, Toby, Swifty Frisko, Box, Winky &amp; The Checkout Hags, Snivelling, Rumble Jack Volunteer, Clara Pandy Engineer

* Pwuc (planet): Halo ends up on Pwuc in the year 4960 having wandered the inner systems for almost a decade.
* Hispus (planet): The planet Halo finds herself on after signing her army release papers.

Other places she had visited or spent time in included Proxima IV, Vescue, Sirius, Skinner&#x27;s World, and Popotoplec. Although it is mentioned that she met the famous historical figure Sally Quasa, this meeting does not take place in the first three books.

==Development==

In his introductions to the three 1986 Titan editions, Moore described its genesis. The story was designed from the outset to avoid the typical &quot;2000 AD&quot; story elements: &quot;guns, guys and gore.&quot; Moore said that he had &quot;no inclination to unleash yet another &#x27;Tough Bitch with a Disintegrator and an Extra Y-Chromosome&#x27; upon the world&quot;. The idea to base the strip around an ordinary, unremarkable woman, typical of the society she lived in, was also very different for &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

Gibson and Moore designed the world that Halo would live in with as much detail as possible. Book One may have been mildly criticised for dropping readers into a future world with no explanation of its social structure, culture, language etc., but the Introduction explains that it was designed to reveal aspects of this carefully constructed world in subtle and clever ways. In this book the creators introduce the reader to 50th-century politics, social problems, diet, cults, music, futuristic slang, fashion and also an ongoing off-world war that is clearly taking place in the background.

Moore and Gibson&#x27;s collaboration paid off when the go-ahead for a second series was given. Both men were excited about where the story was heading and Book Two expanded upon what they had created before. They upped the action quotient and also created some shattering emotional scenes. Moore has said that the character of &quot;the Glyph&quot;, introduced in Book Two, clinched the book&#x27;s success (according to his comments in the introduction to the Titan Books collected edition in 1986).

===Creator cameos===
Both Ian Gibson and Alan Moore make a cameo appearance in the series. In Book 3, when Halo first arrives at the Glory Barge on the planet Pwuc (where she meets Toy recruiting soldiers for the Terran army), Gibson and Moore appear as two figures in the crowd – a bearded man holding a pencil and another man holding a paintbrush. Moore can also be seen being rickshawed through the rainy street on the planet Hispus after Halo has signed her release papers.

===Book 4 and possible continuations===

Since the publication of Book Three in 1986 fans of the series have been speculating on the possibility of Halo returning for further adventures. In his introduction to the Titan reprint of Book Three in 1986 Alan Moore seemed to be leaving an open door for Halo&#x27;s story to return to the comic:

Moore has had very little to say about Halo&#x27;s return since then. &quot;I&#x27;d got plans to have her grow up and eventually end as an old woman,&quot; Moore told &quot;Mustard&quot; magazine in January 2006. &quot;But I got to the point where I&#x27;d said to IPC, &quot;Look, you know that you&#x27;ve ripped these characters off from us. If you were to give us the rights back, I would gladly write another three books of Halo Jones. Whereas if you don&#x27;t I will never write Halo Jones and you won&#x27;t get any money from the character. And they thought, &#x27;Yeah, let&#x27;s hang on to the character forever and you never get any rights to it and never write any again.&#x27; So that&#x27;s where it is.&quot; A report from a 2004 BBC radio interview taping recalls that when asked to tell the audience about Halo Jones, &quot;Moore smiled fondly as if someone had just reminded him of an ex-girlfriend who he&#x27;d never meant to split up with.&quot;

In a 2011 interview for &quot;3:AM&quot; magazine Alan Moore stated &quot;the next adventure would have probably been when she was a female space pirate with Sally Quasa&quot;, &quot;I would have been basically going through all the decades of her life, with her getting older in each one, because I liked the idea, at the time, of having a strip in 2000AD with a seventy or eighty year old woman as the title character ... it would have ended up with Halo Jones upon some planet that is right at the absolute edge of the universe where, beyond that, beyond some sort of spectacular lightshow, there is no space, no time, and it would have ended up with Halo Jones – all the rest of the people on this planetoid because, actually, time is not passing; you could stay there forever, potentially – and what would have happened is that Halo Jones, after spending some time with the rest of the immortals, would have tottered across the landing field, got into her spacecraft, and flown into the psychedelic lightshow, to finally get out.&quot;

In a 2002 interview with Gavin Hanly on the&quot;2000AD Review&quot; website, Ian Gibson was asked about people&#x27;s ongoing interest in the series and whether there was ever any intention to do a fourth series:
In another interview on the Ximoc site Gibson reiterated his desire to keep the series going. When asked about his &quot;dream project&quot; he says: &quot;I&#x27;m also sure that many of Halo&#x27;s fans would like me to do some more books to continue the series. Just a shame Alan doesn&#x27;t want to be involved (as far as I know?)&quot;

==Publication history==
===Other appearances===

The last occasion that Moore and Gibson collaborated on a Halo piece was for the 500th edition of &quot;2000 AD&quot; in December 1986. A portrait of Halo is featured on this special issue&#x27;s glossy cover. Inside many &quot;2000 AD&quot; artists had fun with their own creations. In the strip &quot;Thargshead Revisited&quot; the editor of the comic (the alien Tharg) takes a journey through his own head and encounters many characters from &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s past. The page drawn by Ian Gibson features Halo, Rodice and Toy involved in a game of strip poker with Sam Slade (with the head of Luiz Cannibal on a plate on the table). This was the last time that Moore wrote dialogue for these characters.

Prog 2000 featured Halo beating Hap Hazzard and Finn before getting blown away by the Missionary Man in that issue&#x27;s character Deathmatch.

&quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, a Judge Dredd story written by Garth Ennis (12 episodes Progs 1250–1261) features cameos from a myriad of previous &quot;2000AD&quot; characters including Halo Jones in episodes 6 &amp; 7. Artwork by Carlos Ezquerra and Henry Flint.

Jones has since appeared on one page of the 20th anniversary strip &#x27;A Night 2 Remember&#x27; (Prog 1280), written by Robbie Morrison and illustrated by Gibson.

==Reprinting==
In December 2000 a special &quot;2000 AD&quot; issue (titled &#x27;Prog 2001&#x27;) was released featuring another full colour portrait of Halo. Titan were planning a reissue of the &quot;Complete Ballad of Halo Jones&quot; in July 2001 and this portrait was used as the cover art. The first collected edition had been published by Titan in September 1991. This time the introduction to the book was written by Ian Gibson. &quot;2000AD&quot; hyped up the release on its site: &quot;Alan Moore&#x27;s hugely acclaimed saga of one woman&#x27;s quest for reason in a galaxy gone mad. Out of print now for nearly a decade, fans have been clamouring for this collection anew, especially with the success of Moore&#x27;s ABC line. This classic tale, lovingly rendered by artist Ian Gibson, is now available again in its epic entirety&quot;.

The back cover of the book similarly heralded the return of a comic legend: &quot;Meet Halo Jones. She&#x27;s going out...and out...and out! Escaping the Hoop, Manhattan Island&#x27;s land of mindless leisure, is just the first step in a cosmic adventure that will take Halo to the far ends of the galaxy, through war and peace, trial, despair and triumph. You&#x27;ve never met anyone quite like Halo...and you never will again.&quot;

&quot;Possibly the first feminist heroine in comics&quot;, wrote &quot;The Observer&quot; of Alan Moore&#x27;s epic tale of one woman&#x27;s search for her place in a galaxy out of control. &quot;Originally published in 2000 AD and then collected by Titan Books, this classic tale of future alienation and an individual&#x27;s struggle remains a timeless testament to the genius of Moore. Beautifully illustrated by artist Ian Gibson, this is the ultimate sci-fi opus. Don&#x27;t dare miss it!&quot;

US reviewers also welcomed the book&#x27;s return: &quot;Criminally out of print for the last few years. Halo Jones is one of the finest graphic novels ever created – if you&#x27;ve never given them a go, shame on you – but this is the perfect place to start if men in tights superhero stuff puts you off. Halo Jones has it all – a fantastic storyline, cinematic graphics and characters that knock dead most of the ciphers you find in contemporary fiction.&quot;

&quot;The Complete Ballad of Halo Jones&quot; was voted the third best book of 2001 by the readers of &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; magazine.

The whole trilogy was reprinted in &quot;2000 AD: The Ultimate Collection&quot; in September 2017.

===US Quality Comics===

A year after the end of the publication on the pages of &quot;2000 AD&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of Halo Jones&quot; was reprinted in the United States by Quality Comics. Publisher&#x27;s Bob Keenan and Sal Quartuccio had secured the rights to reissue colourised versions of &quot;2000 AD&quot; characters Judge Dredd, Rogue Trooper, Strontium Dog, Sam Slade and Halo Jones. New covers were commissioned for these comics by artists such as Bill Mayer, Bart Sears and Jim Fern. Eva Brozowski served as the colourist for the covers (her initials can be seen separately to the artist&#x27;s). To fit the square &quot;2000 AD&quot; pages to American comic book format, Quality attached a distorting lens to a photocopy machine, elongating and &quot;effectively destroying the art in the process&quot; according to one reviewer.

As well as the main story these reprints also include some Gibson work from &quot;2000 AD&quot;s vaults such as &quot;The Amazing Maze Dumoir&quot;, and &quot;You Win Some You Lose Some&quot; (both scripted by Alan Hebden). Also featured during this run were episodes of Anderson Psi Division, Ro-busters, Sooner or Later, Dash Decent and Alan Moore&#x27;s Abelard Snazz and his&quot; Future Shocks&quot; story &quot;Sunburn&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Halo Jones has been mentioned in popular culture:

The UK band Halo James was named after the eponymous character.

The debut album &quot;Pop Art&quot; by 1980s group Transvision Vamp features a track entitled &quot;Hanging out with Halo Jones&quot;.

The Shriekback song &quot;Malaria&quot; includes the line &quot;I wanna live with Halo Jones&quot;.

==Merchandise and adaptations==
A stage adaptation of &quot;The Ballad of Halo Jones&quot; was a surprise hit at the 1987 Edinburgh Festival. In 1988 the Red Theatre Company toured the show around the UK.

Another stage adaptation: In 2001, &quot;Book One&quot; of the story appeared as a play in Liverpool.

In 2012, a new stage adaptation covering Book One and Book Two of the series was performed as a fringe theatre production in Manchester. Leah Moore attended one of the performances.

Halo Jones T-shirts issued by &quot;2000 AD&quot; in the 1980s had the slogan &quot;Hoop-life Hero&quot; on them.

In the 1980s, a computer game was developed for the Spectrum and Amstrad computers, based around the shopping trip that Halo takes. It was unreleased due to the Piranha Software being closed down by its parent company.

A Full-Cast audioplay adaptation was released in 2021 by Penguin Audio featuring Sheila Atim as Halo Jones.

<doc id="324424" wikidata="Q16244733" url="?curid=324424" title="Bowel obstruction">
<text>Bowel obstruction, also known as intestinal obstruction, is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion. Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, bloating and not passing gas. Mechanical obstruction is the cause of about 5 to 15% of cases of severe abdominal pain of sudden onset requiring admission to hospital.
Causes of bowel obstruction include adhesions, hernias, volvulus, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, tumors, diverticulitis, ischemic bowel, tuberculosis and intussusception. Small bowel obstructions are most often due to adhesions and hernias while large bowel obstructions are most often due to tumors and volvulus. The diagnosis may be made on plain X-rays; however, CT scan is more accurate. Ultrasound or MRI may help in the diagnosis of children or pregnant women.
The condition may be treated conservatively or with surgery. Typically intravenous fluids are given, a nasogastric (NG) tube is placed through the nose into the stomach to decompress the intestines, and pain medications are given. Antibiotics are often given. In small bowel obstruction about 25% require surgery. Complications may include sepsis, bowel ischemia and bowel perforation.
About 3.2 million cases of bowel obstruction occurred in 2015 which resulted in 264,000 deaths. Both sexes are equally affected and the condition can occur at any age. Bowel obstruction has been documented throughout history, with cases detailed in the Ebers Papyrus of 1550 BC and by Hippocrates.
==Signs and symptoms==
Depending on the level of obstruction, bowel obstruction can present with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and constipation. Bowel obstruction may be complicated by dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities due to vomiting; respiratory compromise from pressure on the diaphragm by a distended abdomen, or aspiration of vomitus; bowel ischemia or perforation from prolonged distension or pressure from a foreign body and subsequently sepsis due to bowel flora.
In small bowel obstruction, the pain tends to be colicky (cramping and intermittent) in nature, with spasms lasting a few minutes. The pain tends to be central and mid-abdominal. Vomiting may occur before constipation. Common physical exam findings may include signs of dehydration, abdominal distension with tympany, nonspecific abdominal tenderness, and high pitched tinkly bowel sounds.

In large bowel obstruction, the pain is felt lower in the abdomen and the spasms last longer. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, distension, and severe constipation. Constipation occurs earlier and vomiting may be less prominent. Proximal obstruction of the large bowel may present as small bowel obstruction. Patients may notice a history of bloating and narrowing of stools before the onset of more severe symptoms. Symptoms can present quickly in the cases of volvulus and can present over a longer period of time in the setting of cancer. Common physical exam findings may include a palpable hernia, abdominal distension with tympany, nonspecific lower abdominal tenderness, and a rectal mass.

==Diagnosis==


The main diagnostic tools are blood tests, X-rays of the abdomen, CT scanning, and ultrasound. If a mass is identified, biopsy may determine the nature of the mass.

Radiological signs of bowel obstruction include bowel distension (small bowel loops dilated &gt;3 cm) and the presence of multiple (more than 2) air-fluid levels on supine and erect abdominal radiographs. Ultrasounds may be as useful as CT scanning to make the diagnosis.

Contrast enema or small bowel series or CT scan can be used to define the level of obstruction, whether the obstruction is partial or complete, and to help define the cause of the obstruction. The appearance of water-soluble contrast in the cecum on an abdominal radiograph within 24 hours of it being given by mouth predicts resolution of an adhesive small bowel obstruction with sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 96%.

Colonoscopy, small bowel investigation with ingested camera or push endoscopy, and laparoscopy are other diagnostic options.

===Differential diagnosis===
Differential diagnoses of bowel obstruction include:
* Ileus
* Pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie&#x27;s syndrome
* Intra-abdominal sepsis
* Pneumonia or other systemic illness

==Causes==

===Small bowel obstruction===

Causes of small bowel obstruction include:
* Adhesions from previous abdominal surgery (most common cause)
* Barbed sutures
* Pseudoobstruction
* Hernias containing bowel
* Crohn&#x27;s disease causing adhesions or inflammatory strictures
* Neoplasms, benign or malignant
* Intussusception
* Volvulus
* Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a compression of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery and the abdominal aorta
* Ischemic strictures
* Foreign bodies (e.g. gallstones in gallstone ileus, swallowed objects such as expandable water toys)
* Intestinal atresia
* Urinary retention

After abdominal surgery, the incidence of small bowel obstruction from any cause is 9%. In those where the cause of the obstruction was clear, adhesions are the single most common cause (more than half).

===Large bowel obstruction===

Causes of large bowel obstruction include:
* Neoplasms / cancer
* Diverticulitis / Diverticulosis
* Hernias
* Inflammatory bowel disease
* Colonic volvulus (sigmoid, caecal, transverse colon)
* Adhesions
* Constipation
* Fecal impaction
* Fecaloma
* Colon atresia
* Intestinal pseudoobstruction
* Endometriosis
* Narcotic induced (especially with the large doses given to cancer or palliative care patients)

====Outlet obstruction====
Outlet obstruction is a sub-type of large bowel obstruction and refers to conditions affecting the anorectal region that obstruct defecation, specifically conditions of the pelvic floor and anal sphincters. Outlet obstruction can be classified into four groups.
* Functional outlet obstruction
** Inefficient inhibition of the internal anal sphincter
*** Short-segment Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease
*** Chagas disease
*** Hereditary internal sphincter myopathy
** Inefficient relaxation of the striated pelvic floor muscles
*** Anismus (pelvic floor dyssynergia)
*** Multiple sclerosis
*** Spinal cord lesions
* Mechanical outlet obstruction
** Internal intussusception
** Enterocele
* Dissipation of force vector
** rectocele
** Descending perineum
** Rectal prolapse
* Impaired rectal sensitivity
** Megarectum
** Rectal hyposensitivity

==Treatment==
Treatment of small and large bowel obstructions are initially similar and non-operative management is usually the initial management strategy as the majority of small bowel obstruction resolve spontaneously with non-operative management. Patients are monitored by the surgical team for signs of improvement and resolution of the obstruction on imaging; if the obstruction does not clear then surgical management for the treatment of the causative lesion is required. In malignant large bowel obstruction, endoscopically placed self-expanding metal stents may be used to temporarily relieve the obstruction as a bridge to surgery, or as palliation. Diagnosis of the type of bowel obstruction is normally conducted through initial plain radiograph of the abdomen, luminal contrast studies, computed tomography scan, or ultrasonography prior to determining the best type of treatment.

Further research is needed to find out if parenteral nutrition is of benefit to people with an inoperable blockage of the bowel caused by advanced cancer.

===Small bowel obstruction===
In the management of small bowel obstructions, a commonly quoted surgical aphorism is: &quot;never let the sun rise or set on small-bowel obstruction&quot; because about 5.5% of small bowel obstructions are ultimately fatal if treatment is delayed. Improvements in radiological imaging of small bowel obstructions allow for confident distinction between simple obstructions, that can be treated conservatively, and obstructions that are surgical emergencies (volvulus, closed-loop obstructions, ischemic bowel, incarcerated hernias, etc.). Exam findings of bowel compromise requiring immediate surgery include: severe abdominal pain, signs of peritonitis such as rebound tenderness, elevated heart rate, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers on lab work, such as lactic acid.

A small flexible tube (nasogastric tube) may be inserted through the nose into the stomach to help decompress the dilated bowel. This tube is uncomfortable but relieves the abdominal cramps, distention, and vomiting. Intravenous therapy is utilized and the urine output may be monitored with a catheter in the bladder.

Most people with SBO are initially managed conservatively because in many cases, the bowel will open up. Some adhesions loosen up and the obstruction resolves. The patient is examined several times a day, and X-ray images are made to ensure he or she is not getting clinically worse.

Conservative treatment involves insertion of a nasogastric tube, correction of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Opioid pain relievers may be used for patients with severe pain but alternate pain relievers are preferred as opioids can decrease bowel motility.Antiemetics may be administered if the patient is vomiting. Adhesive obstructions often settle without surgery. If the obstruction is complete surgery is usually required.

Most patients improve with conservative care in 2–5 days. When the obstruction is cancer, surgery is the only treatment. Those with bowel resection or lysis of adhesions usually stay in the hospital a few more days until they can eat and walk.

Small bowel obstruction caused by Crohn&#x27;s disease, peritoneal carcinomatosis, sclerosing peritonitis, radiation enteritis, and postpartum bowel obstruction are typically treated conservatively, i.e. without surgery.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for non-ischemic cases of SBO is good with mortality rates of 3–5%, while prognosis for SBO with ischemia is fair with mortality rates as high as 30%.

Cases of SBO related to cancer are more complicated and require additional intervention to address the malignancy, recurrence, and metastasis, and thus are associated with a more poor prognosis. Surgical options in patients with malignant bowel obstruction need to be considered carefully as while it may provide relief of symptoms in the short term, there is a high risk of mortality and re-obstruction.

All cases of abdominal surgical intervention are associated with increased risk of future small-bowel obstructions. Statistics from U.S. healthcare report 18.1% re-admittance rate within 30 days for patients who undergo SBO surgery. More than 90% of patients also form adhesions after major abdominal surgery.
Common consequences of these adhesions include small-bowel obstruction, chronic abdominal pain, pelvic pain, and infertility.

<text>John Patrick McEnroe Jr. (born February 16, 1959) is an American former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 170 weeks, and as world No. 1 in men&#x27;s doubles for 269 weeks (third-most of all time). He is one of two male players (alongside Stefan Edberg) to have held both No. 1 rankings, and the only one to hold both simultaneously. McEnroe was best known during his playing career for his shot-making and volleying skills, his rivalries with Björn Borg and Jimmy Connors, and his confrontational on-court behavior, which frequently landed him in trouble with umpires and tennis authorities.

McEnroe won an Open Era record 155 career titles: 77 in singles and 78 in doubles. This includes seven singles majors (four at the US Open and three at Wimbledon), nine men&#x27;s doubles majors, and one mixed doubles major. McEnroe is the only male player to win more than 70 titles in both singles and doubles. His singles match record of 82–3 in 1984 remains the best single-season win rate of the Open Era. McEnroe also excelled at the year-end tournaments, winning eight singles and seven doubles titles, both of which are records. Three of his winning singles year-end championships were at the Masters Grand Prix (the ATP year-end event) and five were at the World Championship Tennis (WCT) Finals, an event that ended in 1989. He was named the ATP Player of the Year and the ITF World Champion three times each: in 1981, 1983 and 1984.

McEnroe contributed to five Davis Cup titles for the U.S. and later was team captain. He has stayed active in retirement, often competing in senior events on the ATP Champions Tour, where he has won 25 titles. He also works as a television commentator during the majors.

==Early life==
McEnroe was born in Wiesbaden, West Germany, to American parents, John Patrick McEnroe and his wife Kay (). His father, the son of Irish immigrants, was at the time stationed with the United States Air Force (USAF), once revealing during a press conference in Belgium that his son &#x27;John was made in Belgium but born in Germany.&#x27; McEnroe&#x27;s Irish paternal grandfather was from Ballyjamesduff in County Cavan and his grandmother was from County Westmeath.

When John was about nine months old his father was transferred back to the US, and the family relocated to Stewart Air Force Base in Newburgh, New York. After leaving the service, McEnroe&#x27;s father worked as an advertising agent while attending Fordham Law School at night. In 1961 the family moved to New York City, settling in Flushing, Queens. Two years later it shifted to the nearby neighborhood of Douglaston. John has two younger brothers: Mark (born 1964) and former professional tennis player Patrick (born 1966).

McEnroe began playing tennis at the Douglaston Club when he was eight. At nine, his parents enrolled him in the Eastern Lawn Tennis Association, followed by competing in regional tournaments, then national juniors tournaments. By twelve he was ranked seventh in his age group, and joined the Port Washington Tennis Academy on Long Island, New York. McEnroe attended Trinity School in Manhattan, graduating in 1977.

==Career==
McEnroe began to make his mark as an 18-year-old amateur in 1977. He won both the Junior singles and mixed doubles titles at the French Open, partnering with Mary Carillo in the latter. He later progressed through the singles qualifying tournament at Wimbledon and into the main draw, where he lost in the semifinals to Jimmy Connors in four sets. It was the best performance by a male qualifier at any major, and a record performance by an amateur in the Open era.

After Wimbledon, McEnroe was recruited by coach Dick Gould and entered Stanford University. In 1978 he won the NCAA singles title, and he led the Stanford team to an NCAA championship. Later that year he joined the ATP tour and signed his first professional endorsement deal, with Sergio Tacchini. He again advanced to the semifinals at a major, this time the US Open, losing again to Connors. In all, McEnroe won five titles in 1978, including his first Masters Grand Prix, beating Arthur Ashe in straight sets, as well as Grand Prix events at Stockholm and Wembley. His late-season success allowed him to finish as the year-end world No. 4 player.

===1979–83===

In 1979, McEnroe and partner Peter Fleming won the Wimbledon men&#x27;s doubles title, followed shortly by a win in the US Open doubles. That same week, McEnroe won the singles US Open title, his first major singles title. He defeated his friend Vitas Gerulaitis in straight-sets in the final to become the youngest male winner of the singles title at the US Open since Pancho Gonzales, who was also 20 in 1948. McEnroe also won the prestigious season-ending WCT Finals, beating Björn Borg in four sets. McEnroe won 10 singles and 17 doubles titles that year for a total of 27 titles, an Open Era record, finishing at No. 3 in the year-end world singles rankings.

At Wimbledon in 1980, McEnroe reached the singles final for the first time, where he faced Björn Borg, who was seeking his fifth consecutive Wimbledon title. At the start of the final, McEnroe was booed by the crowd as he entered Centre Court, following heated exchanges with officials during his semifinal victory over Jimmy Connors. In a fourth-set tiebreaker that lasted 20 minutes, McEnroe saved five championship points en route to an 18–16 win. McEnroe, however, could not break Borg&#x27;s serve in the fifth set, which he dropped 8–6. This match was voted the third greatest open era Wimbledon men&#x27;s singles final in a BBC poll in 2020.

Two months later McEnroe bested Borg in the five-set final of the 1980 US Open. He was a finalist at the season-ending WCT Finals, and finished as the world No. 2 ranked player behind Borg.
McEnroe remained controversial when he returned to Wimbledon in 1981. Following his first-round match against Tom Gullikson, McEnroe was fined U.S. $1,500 and came close to being ejected after he called umpire Ted James &quot;the pits of the world&quot; and then swore at tournament referee Fred Hoyles. He also made famous the phrase &quot;you cannot be serious&quot;, which years later became the title of his autobiography, by shouting it after several umpires&#x27; calls during his matches. This behavior was in sharp contrast to that of his then-rival Borg, who was painted by the press as an unflappable &quot;Ice Man.&quot; However, in matches against Borg, McEnroe notably never lost his temper.

After the controversy and criticism from the British press (earning him the nicknamed &quot;SuperBrat&quot; from Ian Barnes of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;), McEnroe again reached the Wimbledon men&#x27;s singles final against Borg. McEnroe prevailed in four sets, ending the Swede&#x27;s run of 41 consecutive match victories at the All England Club. American TV commentator Bud Collins quipped after the match (which took place on the United States&#x27; Independence Day), paraphrasing &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;, &quot;Stick a feather in his cap and call it &#x27;McEnroe-ni&#x27;!&quot;.

In response to McEnroe&#x27;s on-court outbursts during the Championships, the All England Club declined to accord McEnroe honorary club membership, an honor normally given to singles champions after their first victory. McEnroe responded by not attending the traditional champions&#x27; dinner that evening. The honor was eventually granted McEnroe as a repeat champion.

Borg and McEnroe had their final confrontation in the final of the 1981 US Open. McEnroe won in four sets, becoming the first man since the 1920s to win three consecutive US Open singles titles. Borg never played another major. McEnroe also won his second WCT Final, beating Johan Kriek in straight sets and finished the year as the number one ranked player. He was named the Associated Press Athlete of the Year, the second men&#x27;s tennis player to receive the honor after Don Budge in the 1930s.

McEnroe lost only one set going into the final of Wimbledon 1982. However, he lost to Connors in the final, despite being a tiebreak from victory at the end of the fourth set. He then fell in the semifinals at the US Open and was runner-up at the WCT Finals. He was able to retain the ATP&#x27;s world No. 1 ranking based on points at the end of the year, having won significant events at Philadelphia, Wembley, and Tokyo; but due to Connors&#x27;s victories at the two most important events of the year (Wimbledon and the US Open), Connors was named the Player of the Year by the ATP and most other tennis authorities.

In 1983, McEnroe reached his fourth consecutive Wimbledon final, dropping only one set en route, and swept aside the unheralded Chris Lewis in straight sets for his second Wimbledon crown. At the US Open, he was defeated in the fourth round, his earliest exit since 1977. He then played at the Australian Open for the first time, reaching the semifinals before being defeated in four sets by Mats Wilander. He made the WCT Final for the third time and beat Ivan Lendl in an epic five-setter. He took the Masters Grand Prix title for the second time, again beating Lendl in straight sets. He also won prized events at Philadelphia, Forest Hills, and Wembley, enabling him to capture the year-end No. 1 ranking once again.

===1984: best season===

McEnroe&#x27;s best season came in 1984, as he compiled an 82–3 match record that remains the highest single-season win rate of the Open Era. He won a career-best 13 singles tournaments, including Wimbledon and the US Open, capturing the year-end No. 1 ranking. He also played on the winning US World Team Cup and runner-up Davis Cup teams.

McEnroe began the year with a 42-match win streak, winning his first six tournaments and reaching his first French Open final, where his opponent was Ivan Lendl. McEnroe won the first two sets, but Lendl&#x27;s adjustments of using more topspin lobs and cross-court backhand passing shots, as well as McEnroe&#x27;s fatigue and temperamental outbursts, resulted in a demoralizing five-set loss. In his autobiography, McEnroe described this as his most bitter defeat and implied that he&#x27;s never quite gotten over it.

He rebounded at Wimbledon, losing just one set en route to his third Wimbledon singles title. This included a straight-set rout over Jimmy Connors in the final. He then won his fourth US Open title, defeating Lendl in straight sets in the final, after defeating Connors in a five-set semifinal. He also won his fourth WCT Final, defeating Connors in straight sets, and took his third Masters Grand Prix, beating Lendl in straight sets. His combined record against the number 2 and 3 ranked players for the year, Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl, respectively, was 11–1, only losing to Lendl at the French Open and going undefeated versus Connors in five matches.

The year did not end without controversy. While playing and winning the tournament in Stockholm, McEnroe had an on-court outburst that soon became notorious. After questioning a call made by the chair umpire, McEnroe demanded, &quot;Answer my question! The question, jerk!&quot; McEnroe then slammed his racquet into a juice cart beside the court in anger, and the stadium crowd booed him. He was suspended for 3 weeks (21 days) for exceeding a $7,500 limit on fines that had been levied due to his behavior. As a result, he was disqualified from competing in the following week&#x27;s significant Wembley (London) Indoor tournament, at which he was supposed to be the number one seed, with Connors and Lendl (the eventual winner) as the second and third seeds. During his suspension, he injured his left wrist in practice, causing him to withdraw from the Australian Open.

===Taking time off===
In 1985, having reached the semifinals at the French Open, McEnroe was beaten in straight sets by Kevin Curren in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. He reached his last major singles final at the US Open; this time, he was beaten in straight sets by Lendl. He did not advance past the quarterfinals at the WCT Finals or the Masters Grand Prix. He did win important events at Philadelphia (his fourth straight there), Canada (second straight) and Stockholm (second straight and fourth overall) and finished the year as the world No. 2 ranked player.

In 1986, McEnroe took a six-month break from the tour. This meant he would miss Wimbledon. It was during this sabbatical that on August 1, 1986, he married actress Tatum O&#x27;Neal, with whom he had already had a son, Kevin (1986). They had two more children, Sean (1987) and Emily (1991), before divorcing in 1994. When McEnroe returned to the tour later in 1986, he won three ATP tournaments, but in 1987 he failed to win a title for the first time since turning professional. After losing in the first round of the French Open he withdrew from Wimbledon with an injured back just prior to the start of the tournament. This was the second consecutive year that he missed the championships at Wimbledon. He took another seven-month break from the game following the US Open, where he was suspended for two months and fined US$17,500 () for misconduct and verbal abuse.

===World No. 1 ranking===
McEnroe became the top-ranked singles player in the world on March 3, 1980. He was the top-ranked player on 14 separate occasions between 1980 and 1985 and finished the year ranked No. 1 four straight years from 1981 through 1984. He spent a total of 170 weeks at the top of the rankings.

===Success in doubles===

In addition to his success as a singles player, McEnroe was also highly successful in doubles, ranking at number 1 in doubles for a combined 270 weeks and winning ten Grand Slam doubles titles. His first Grand Slam doubles title was the 1977 French Open mixed doubles with childhood friend Mary Carillo. His most successful partnership was with Peter Fleming, which whom he won 57 doubles titles, including seven Grand Slams (four at Wimbledon and three at the US Open). Fleming was modest about his own contribution to the partnership, once remarking that &quot;the best doubles partnership in the world is John McEnroe and anybody.&quot;

McEnroe&#x27;s success led to some writing that he might have been &quot;the greatest doubles player of all time&quot; and &quot;possibly the greatest team player never to have played a team sport.&quot;

McEnroe won a fourth US Open men&#x27;s doubles title in 1989 with Mark Woodforde, and a fifth Wimbledon men&#x27;s doubles title in 1992 with Michael Stich.

===Davis Cup===
More than any other player in his era, McEnroe was responsible for reviving American interest in the Davis Cup, which had been shunned by Jimmy Connors and other leading U.S. players, and had not seen a top U.S. player regularly compete since Arthur Ashe. Connors&#x27;s refusal to play Davis Cup instead of lucrative exhibitions had been a source of enmity between him and Ashe. In 1978, McEnroe won two singles rubbers in the final as the U.S. captured the Cup for the first time since 1972, beating Great Britain in the final. McEnroe continued to be a mainstay of U.S. Davis Cup teams for the next 14 years, and was part of title-winning teams in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1992. He set numerous U.S. Davis Cup records, including years played (12), ties (30), singles wins (41), and total wins in singles and doubles (59). He played both singles and doubles in 13 series, and he and Peter Fleming won 14 of 15 Davis Cup doubles matches together.

An epic performance was McEnroe&#x27;s 6-hour, 22-minute victory over Mats Wilander in the deciding rubber of the quarterfinal win over Sweden in 1982, played in St. Louis, Missouri. McEnroe won the match, at the time the longest in Davis Cup history, 9–7, 6–2, 15–17, 3–6, 8–6. McEnroe nearly broke that record in a 6-hour, 20-minute Davis Cup loss to Boris Becker five years later. Becker won that match, the second rubber in a 3–2 loss to West Germany in World Group Relegation play, 4–6, 15–13, 8–10, 6–2, 6–2.

McEnroe also helped the U.S. win the World Team Cup in 1984 and 1985, in both cases defeating Czechoslovakia in the final.

===Final years on the tour===
McEnroe struggled to regain his form after his 1986 sabbatical. He lost three times at majors to Ivan Lendl, losing straight-set quarterfinals at both the 1987 US Open and the 1989 Australian Open, and a long four-set match, played over two days, in the fourth round of the 1988 French Open. Rumors of drug abuse had begun during his second sabbatical. McEnroe denied them at the time, but later acknowledged he had used cocaine during his career in a 2000 interview, although he denied that the drug affected his play.

McEnroe had multiple notable victories in the final years of his career. In the 1988 French Open, McEnroe beat 16-year-old Michael Chang 6–0, 6–3, 6–1 in the third round; Chang went on to win the title the next year. In 1989, McEnroe won a record fifth title at the World Championship Tennis Finals (the championship tournament of the WCT tour, which was being staged for the last time), defeating top-ranked Lendl in the semifinals. At Wimbledon, he defeated Mats Wilander in a four-set quarterfinal before losing to Stefan Edberg in the semifinals. He won the RCA Championships in Indianapolis and reached the final of the Canadian Open, where he lost to Lendl. He also won both of his singles rubbers in the quarterfinal Davis Cup tie with Sweden.

Controversy was never far from McEnroe, however; in his fourth-round match against Mikael Pernfors at the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe was ejected from the tournament for swearing at the umpire, supervisor, and referee. He was warned by the umpire for intimidating a lineswoman, and then docked a point for smashing a racket. McEnroe was apparently unaware that a new Code of Conduct, which had been introduced just before the tournament, meant that a third code violation would lead not to the deduction of a game but instead in immediate disqualification. He was also fined $6,500 for the incidents.

Later that year, McEnroe reached the semifinals of the US Open, losing to the eventual champion Pete Sampras in four sets. He also won the Davidoff Swiss Indoors in Basel, defeating Goran Ivanišević in a five-set final. The last time McEnroe was ranked in the world&#x27;s top ten was on October 22, 1990; his end-of-year singles ranking was 13th.

In 1991, McEnroe won the last edition of the Volvo Tennis-Chicago tournament by defeating his brother Patrick in the final. He won both of his singles rubbers in the quarterfinal Davis Cup tie with Spain. He reached the fourth round at Wimbledon (losing to Edberg) and the third round at the US Open (losing to Chang in a five-set night match). His end-of-year singles ranking was No. 28.

In 1992, McEnroe defeated third-ranked and defending champion Boris Becker in the third round of the Australian Open 6–4, 6–3, 7–5 before a sell-out crowd. In the fourth round, McEnroe needed 4 hours 42 minutes to defeat ninth-ranked Emilio Sánchez 8–6 in the fifth set. He lost to Wayne Ferreira in the quarterfinals. At Wimbledon, McEnroe reached the semifinals where he lost in straight sets to the eventual champion Andre Agassi. McEnroe also teamed with Michael Stich to win his fifth Wimbledon men&#x27;s doubles title in a record-length 5-hour-1-minute final, which the pair won 5–7, 7–6, 3–6, 7–6, 19–17. At the end of the year, he teamed with Pete Sampras to win the doubles rubber in the Davis Cup final, where the U.S. defeated Switzerland 3–1.

McEnroe retired from the professional tour at the end of 1992. He ended his singles career ranked world No. 20. He played in one tournament in 1994 as a wildcard at the Rotterdam Open, losing in the first round. This was his last singles match on the ATP Tour.

After Steffi Graf won the 1999 French Open, McEnroe suggested to her that they play mixed doubles at Wimbledon. She agreed, and they went on to reach the semifinals, but withdrew at that stage because Graf had reached the singles final, and preferred to focus on that tournament.

===Post-retirement from tennis ===

After retiring, McEnroe pursued his post-tour goal of becoming a working musician. He had learned to play guitar with the help of friends like Eddie Van Halen and Eric Clapton. During his divorce, McEnroe formed The Johnny Smyth Band with himself as lead singer and guitarist, began writing songs, and played small gigs in cities where he played with the senior tour. Although Lars Ulrich complimented his &quot;natural instinct for music&quot;, a bar owner where McEnroe&#x27;s band played said that &quot;he couldn&#x27;t sing to save his life.&quot; The band toured for two years, but McEnroe suddenly quit in 1997 just before finishing his first album. In 1997, McEnroe&#x27;s wife, singer-songwriter Patty Smyth, told him, &quot;In future only one of us will be working away from home on a music tour and it ain&#x27;t gonna be you!&quot;

McEnroe was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1999. He is now a sports commentator providing commentary for American television networks such as ESPN, CBS, NBC, and USA at the US Open, the Australian Open, and various ATP tournaments, as well as at Wimbledon for the BBC in the UK.
McEnroe became the U.S. Davis Cup captain in September 1999. His team barely escaped defeat in their first two outings in 2000, beating Zimbabwe and the Czech Republic in tight 3–2 encounters. They were then defeated 5–0 by Spain in the semifinals. McEnroe resigned in November 2000 after 14 months as captain, citing frustration with the Davis Cup schedule and format as two of his primary reasons. His brother Patrick took over the job.

In 2002, McEnroe played himself in &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; and again in 2008 in &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot;. McEnroe played himself in the 2004 movie &quot;Wimbledon&quot;. In July 2004, McEnroe began a CNBC talk show titled &quot;McEnroe&quot;. The show, however, was unsuccessful, twice earning a 0.0 Nielsen rating, and was canceled within five months. In 2002, he hosted the American game show &quot;The Chair&quot; on ABC as well as the British version on BBC One, but this venture also was unsuccessful.

In 2004, McEnroe said that during much of his career he had unwittingly taken steroids. He said that he had been administered these drugs without his knowledge, stating: &quot;For six years I was unaware I was being given a form of steroid of the legal kind they used to give horses until they decided it was too strong even for horses.&quot;

McEnroe is active in philanthropy and tennis development. For years he has co-chaired the City Parks Foundation&#x27;s annual CityParks Tennis fundraiser. The charitable benefit raises crucial funds for New York City&#x27;s largest municipal youth tennis programs. He collects American contemporary art, and opened a gallery in Manhattan in 1993.

McEnroe still plays regularly on the ATP Champions Tour. One victory came at the Jean-Luc Lagardere Trophy in Paris in 2010, where he defeated Guy Forget in the final. Playing on the Champions Tour allows him to continue his most iconic rivalries with old adversaries Ivan Lendl and Björn Borg. His last and 26th win (a record since 2001 when the ATP acquired the Champions Tour) was his 2016 win at Stockholm against Thomas Muster.

In charity events and World Team Tennis, he has beaten many top players, including Mardy Fish and Mark Philippoussis.

In 2007, McEnroe received the Philippe Chatrier Award (the ITF&#x27;s highest accolade) for his contributions to tennis both on and off the court. Later that year, he also appeared on the NBC comedy &quot;30 Rock&quot; as the host of a game show called &quot;Gold Case&quot; in which he uttered his famous line &quot;You cannot be serious!&quot; when a taping went awry. McEnroe also appeared on the HBO comedy &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

In 2009, McEnroe appeared on &quot;30 Rock&quot; again, in the episode &quot;Gavin Volure&quot;, where the title character, a mysterious, reclusive businessman (played by Steve Martin) invites him to dinner because he bridges the worlds of &quot;art collecting and yelling.&quot;
In 2010, he founded the John McEnroe Tennis Academy on Randall&#x27;s Island in New York City.

In 2012, McEnroe, commentating for ESPN, heavily criticized Australian tennis player Bernard Tomic for &quot;tanking&quot; against Andy Roddick at the US Open. However, Tomic was cleared of any wrongdoing, saying that he was &quot;simply overwhelmed by the occasion&quot; (this was the first time that he had played at Arthur Ashe Stadium).

McEnroe was part of Milos Raonic&#x27;s coaching team from May to August 2016.

In addition to his other commentary roles, McEnroe was a central figure for Australian television network Nine&#x27;s coverage of the 2019/2020 Australian Open.

McEnroe performed as the off-camera narrator for four seasons (2020–2023) of &quot;Never Have I Ever&quot;, appearing in one episode in Season 1.

On April 2, 2023, McEnroe participated with Michael Chang, Andre Agassi, and Andy Roddick in the first live airing of Pickleball on ESPN in the Million dollar Pickleball Slam at the Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida.

===Return to the tour===
McEnroe returned to the ATP Tour in 2006 to play two doubles tournaments. In his first tournament, he teamed with Jonas Björkman to win the title at the SAP Open in San Jose. This was McEnroe&#x27;s 78th doubles title (No. 5 in history) and his first title since capturing the Paris Indoor doubles title in November 1992 with his brother Patrick. The win meant that McEnroe had won doubles titles in four different decades.

In his second tournament, McEnroe and Björkman lost in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Stockholm.

McEnroe won the over-45 legends doubles competition at the French Open in 2012. He was partnered with his brother Patrick. They beat Guy Forget and Henri Leconte 7–6, 6–3. McEnroe and his brother Patrick won again at the 2014 French Open in the over-45 legends doubles competition. They beat Andres Gomez and Mark Woodforde 4–6, 7–5, 1–0 (10–7).

==Personal life==
McEnroe was married to Academy Award winner Tatum O&#x27;Neal, the daughter of actor Ryan O&#x27;Neal, from 1986 to 1994. They had three children. After their divorce, they were awarded joint custody of the children, but in 1998 McEnroe was awarded sole custody due to O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s addiction to heroin.

In 1997, McEnroe married rock singer Patty Smyth, with whom he has two daughters. They live on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side.

McEnroe has published two autobiographies: &quot;You Cannot Be Serious&quot; (released as &quot;Serious&quot; in the UK) in 2002, and 2017&#x27;s &quot;But Seriously&quot;.

==In popular culture==

McEnroe&#x27;s fiery temper has led to him being parodied in popular culture:
*In 1982, British impressionist Roger Kitter and Kaplan Kaye, under the name of &quot;The Brat&quot;, recorded the single &quot;Chalk Dust - The Umpire Strikes Back&quot; in which Kitter parodied McEnroe losing his temper during a match. The single reached the UK Top 20 and was a Top 10 hit in the Netherlands, Belgium and South Africa.
*His bursts of rage were parodied in the satirical British programme &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, on which he and wife Tatum frequently screamed and threw things at each other.
*Another parody was in the satirical British programme &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, portrayed by Griff Rhys Jones, showing him as a boy arguing with his parents over breakfast.
*He mocked himself in a PETA ad promoting spay and neuter, by launching into one of his famous tirades when challenged about his decision to have his dog fixed.
* In the 1980s he appeared in a commercial for R. White&#x27;s Lemonade in the UK.

* McEnroe was portrayed by Shia LaBeouf in the Swedish biopic &quot;Borg vs McEnroe&quot;, which was released in 2017 depicting their rivalry and in particular the 1980 Wimbledon final.
*McEnroe is referenced in the 1992 hit song &quot;Jump Around&quot; by House of Pain, with the lyric &quot;I&#x27;ll serve your ass like John McEnroe!&quot;.
* In the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; Halloween cartoon &quot;3 Times Halloween Funjob,&quot; Homestar Runner dresses up as McEnroe, and in an Easter egg at the end of the cartoon, a puppet version of Homestar quotes McEnroe&#x27;s Wimbledon tirade.
* In his guest cameo appearance in season four of &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; had Oliver Putnam (played by Martin Short) accidentally bump into McEnroe and angering him, threatening Putnam in the city streets.

<text>Wuyashu (c. 1061–1113) was a chieftain of the Wanyan tribe, the most dominant among the Jurchen tribes which later founded the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). He was the eldest son of Helibo and the elder brother of Aguda (Emperor Taizu), the founder and first emperor of the Jin dynasty. He was posthumously honoured with the temple name Kangzong.

==Life==
Wuyashu was born to the Jurchen chieftain Helibo in 1061. He inherited the leadership position of the Wanyan tribe from his uncle, Yingge (盈歌), in 1104. Yingge died during the conquest of Helandian (曷懶甸; present-day Hamgyong Province, North Korea) after pacifying the Tumen River basin. Wuyashu resumed the project in the next year. Under his order, Shishihuan (石適歡) led a Wanyan army from the Tumen River basin to subdue rival Jurchen tribes in Helandian and advance southward to chase about 1,800 remnants who defected to the Korean kingdom Goryeo. Goryeo did not hand them over but sent Im Kan (林幹) to intercept the Wanyan army. However, Shishihuan defeated Im Kan north of the Chŏngp&#x27;ŏyng wall and invaded northeastern frontier of Goryeo. Goryeo dispatched Yun Kwan to resist the Jurchens but lost in battle again. As a result, Wuyashu subjugated the Jurchens in Helandian.

In 1107, Goryeo sent a delegate, Heihuanfangshi (黑歡方石), to celebrate Wuyashu&#x27;s accession to the chieftainship of the Wanyan tribe, and promised to return those Helandian Jurchens who escaped to Goryeo. However, when Wuyashu&#x27;s delegates, Aguo (阿聒) and Wulinda Shengkun (烏林答勝昆), arrived in Goryeo, the Koreans killed them and dispatched five large armies led by Yun Kwan to attack Helandian. The Goryeo army destroyed a hundred Jurchen villages and built nine fortresses there. Wuyashu thought about giving up Helandian, but his brother Aguda convinced him to dispatch Wosai (斡賽), another of their brothers, to fight Goryeo. Wosai also built nine fortresses facing Goryeo&#x27;s nine fortresses. After a one-year battle, the Wanyan army won two fortresses but they suffered heavy losses and seven other fortresses were still held by the Goryeo forces. Jurchens offered a truce to Goryeo and Goryeo and the Jurchens achieved a settlement. As a result, Jurchens swore not to invade Goryeo and Goryeo withdrew from the nine fortresses.

Wuyashu also pacified the Suifen River basin. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Aguda, when he died in 1113.

<text>Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody, sold under the brand name Remicade among others, is a medication used to treat a number of autoimmune diseases. This includes Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Behçet&#x27;s disease. It is given by slow injection into a vein, typically at six- to eight-week intervals.
Common side effects include infections, acute infusion reactions, and abdominal pain. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody biologic. It seems to work by binding to and neutralizing TNF-α, preventing it from interacting with its receptors on the cell. TNF-α is a chemical messenger (cytokine) and a key part of the autoimmune reaction.
Infliximab was originally developed in mice as a mouse antibody. Because humans have immune reactions to mouse proteins, the mouse common domains were replaced with similar human antibody domains. They are monoclonal antibodies and have identical structures and affinities to the target. Because they are a combination of mouse and human antibody amino acid sequences, they are called a &quot;chimeric monoclonal antibody&quot;.

Infliximab was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998, and in the European Union in August 1999. Infliximab biosimilars have been approved in the EU (2013), in Japan (2014), and in the United States (2016, 2017, 2019). It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.
==Medical uses==

===Crohn&#x27;s disease===
Three phenotypes, or categories of disease, are present in Crohn&#x27;s disease: stricturing disease (which causes narrowing of the bowel), penetrating disease (which causes fistulae or abnormal connections of the bowel), and inflammatory disease (which primarily causes inflammation).

====Fistulizing disease====
Infliximab was first used for closure of fistulae in Crohn&#x27;s disease in 1999. In a 94-patient, phase II clinical trial, the researchers showed infliximab was effective in closing fistulae between the skin and bowel in 56–68% of patients. A large, 296-patient Phase III clinical trial called the ACCENT 2 trial showed infliximab was additionally beneficial in maintaining closure of fistulae, with almost two-thirds of all patients treated with the three initial doses of infliximab having a fistula response after 14 weeks, and 36% of patients maintaining closure of fistulae after a year, compared with 19% who received placebo therapy. This final trial resulted in the FDA approval of the drug to treat fistulizing disease.

====Inflammatory disease====
Infliximab has been used to induce and maintain remission in inflammatory Crohn&#x27;s disease. The ACCENT 1 trial, a large, multicentre trial, found 39–45% of patients treated with infliximab, who had an initial response to it, maintained remission after 30 weeks, compared with 21% who received placebo treatment. It also showed a mean maintenance of remission from 38 to 54 weeks compared with 21 weeks for patients who received placebo treatment.

Crohn&#x27;s patients have flares of their disease between periods of disease quiescence. Severe flares are usually treated with steroid medications to obtain remission, but steroids have many undesirable side effects, so some gastroenterologists are now advocating the use of infliximab as the first drug to try to get patients into remission. This has been called the top-down approach to treatment.

===Ulcerative colitis===
Infliximab targets TNF, thought to be more related to Th1 cytokines. Ulcerative colitis was thought to be a Th2 disease, and infliximab would be of limited use. However, patients with ulcerative colitis have begun to be treated with infliximab on the basis of two large clinical trials conducted in 2005 by Paul Rutgeerts and William Sandborn. The Acute ulcerative Colitis Treatment trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to evaluate the utility of infliximab in ulcerative colitis showed 44–45% of patients treated with infliximab for a year maintained a response to the medication, compared with 21% of patients who were treated with placebo medication. At two months, the response was 61–69% for patients treated with infliximab, and 31% for those treated with placebo.

===Psoriatic arthritis===
In psoriatic arthritis (PsA), inhibitors of TNF, such as infliximab, improve the signs and symptoms. Several therapies with modest efficacy have been studied in nail psoriasis. Among available agents, higher quality data are available to support the efficacy of cyclosporine and infliximab. Based on studies in AS, the results suggest infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab have the potential to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active axial involvement in PsA in patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAID (level 1a, grade A). The anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept; level 1b, grade A) are more effective for the treatment of enthesitis than traditional agents. Results suggest infliximab is effective for the treatment of dactylitis in PsA.

===Other===
It was approved for treating ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis.

Infliximab is also prescribed (out of indication) for the treatment of Behçet&#x27;s disease.

Infliximab is the most frequently used biological agent in treating relapsing polychondritis. Half of the patients saw benefit from this treatment, and a few other patients experienced infections that in some cases lead to death.

There have been numerous case reports of the efficacy of infliximab in various inflammatory skin conditions diseases; the FDA approved infliximab for chronic severe plaque psoriasis in adults in September 2006.

Infliximab has been used off-label in treating refractory sarcoidosis, where other treatments have not been effective.

Infliximab has been tested in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but there was no evidence of benefit with the possibility of harm.

Infliximab is indicated for steroid refractory checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis, at a dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg.

Infliximab has been found to be a safe alternative treatment to a second dose of IVIG for Kawasaki Disease resistant to initial IVIG therapy, showing better outcomes in fever resolution and fewer severe adverse effects such as hemolytic anemia.

== Adverse effects ==
Infliximab has adverse effects, some life-threatening, common to drugs in the class of TNF inhibiting immunosuppressants (which also includes etanercept (Enbrel) and adalimumab (Humira)). Some of the most severe are:

* serious infections
* reactivation of hepatitis B
* reactivation of tuberculosis
* lethal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (generally only when combined with 6-mercaptopurine)
* drug-induced lupus
* demyelinating central nervous system disorders
* psoriasis and psoriasiform skin lesions
* new-onset vitiligo

Cases of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia (some fatal) have been reported with infliximab. The FDA issued a warning to doctors appearing in the respective product labeling of infliximab instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully. The FDA issued a warning to doctors that there is an increased risk of lymphoma and other cancers associated with the use of infliximab and other tumor necrosis factor blockers in children and adolescents.

Maintenance therapy with the drug (versus intermittent or sporadic therapy) lessens the likelihood of developing antibodies to infliximab which are known to reduce the efficacy of the drug. Combination treatment with methotrexate (an antifolate drug which suppresses the immune system) has been shown to reduce the formation of these antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and combination therapy with other immunosuppressants has been shown to reduce the likelihood of these antibodies being formed in Crohn&#x27;s disease. The use of immunosuppressants may not be necessary in all diseases for which infliximab is indicated, and indiscriminant uses of these other immunosuppressants carry their own risks. Infliximab was studied in monotherapy (without concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or azathioprine) in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.

== Pharmacology ==
Infliximab is a purified, recombinant DNA-derived chimeric human-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody that consists of mouse heavy and light chain variable regions combined with human heavy and light chain constant regions. It has a serum half-life of 9.5 days and can be detected in serum 8 weeks after infusion treatment.

Infliximab neutralizes the biological activity of TNF-α by binding with high affinity to the soluble (free floating in the blood) and transmembrane (located on the outer membranes of T cells and similar immune cells) forms of TNF-α, and inhibits or prevents the effective binding of TNF-α with its receptors. Infliximab and adalimumab (another TNF antagonist) are in the subclass of &quot;anti-TNF antibodies&quot; (they are in the form of naturally occurring antibodies), and are capable of neutralizing all forms (extracellular-, transmembrane-, and receptor-bound) of TNF-α. Etanercept, a third TNF antagonist, is in a different subclass (receptor-construct fusion protein), and, because of its modified form, cannot neutralize receptor-bound TNF-α. Additionally, the anti-TNF antibodies adalimumab and infliximab have the capability of lysing cells involved in the inflammatory process, whereas the receptor fusion protein apparently lacks this capability.

Other monoclonal antibodies targeting TNF-α are golimumab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol. Etanercept also binds and inhibits the action of TNF-α, but is not a monoclonal antibody (it is instead a fusion of TNF-receptor and an antibody constant region).

==History==

The importance of TNF in the development of rheumatoid arthritis was originally demonstrated by George Kollias and colleagues in proof of principle studies in transgenic animal models.

Infliximab was developed by Junming Le (b. 1940) and Jan Vilček (b. 1933) at New York University School of Medicine and in collaboration with Centocor (now Janssen Biotech, Inc.).

==Society and culture==

===Marketing===

Remicade is marketed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. (formerly Centocor Biotech, Inc.) in the United States, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma in Japan, Xian Janssen in China, and Schering-Plough (now part of Merck &amp; Co) elsewhere.

===Biosimilars===
In June 2013, two biosimilar versions (Inflectra and Remsima) were submitted for approval in the European Union, by Hospira and Celltrion Healthcare respectively. Both had a positive opinion from European Medicines Agency&#x27;s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for sale in the European Union (EU). Celltrion obtained marketing authorization approval (MAA) from 27 EU countries and 3 EEA (European Economic Area) countries by September 2013. Inflectra was approved for use in the European Union in September 2013, and Remsima was approved for use in the European Union in October 2013.

In Japan, Celltrion received marketing authorization for Remsima from Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in July 2014.

In India, Epirus Biopharmaceuticals obtained approval to produce biosimilar infliximab under the brand name &quot;Infimab&quot; (trail name BOW015).

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Celltrion/Hospira/Pfizer&#x27;s Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb) in April 2016.

The FDA approved Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd.&#x27;s Renflexis (infliximab-abda) in April 2017.

Biogen released another biosimilar, Flixabi, which was approved in Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. Flixabi was approved for use in the European Union in May 2016.

In December 2017, Ixifi (infliximab-qbtx) was approved in the United States.

Zessly was approved for use in the European Union in May 2018.

In December 2019, Avsola (infliximab-axxq) was approved in the United States.

Avsola was approved for medical use in Canada in March 2020.

In December 2021, Ixifi was approved for medical use in Canada.

=== Availability/affordability ===
Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting. For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages.

In the UK, infliximab is available from the NHS for Crohn&#x27;s disease treatment provided three criteria are met. Patients should have severe active Crohn&#x27;s disease with a CDAI score of 300 or more, have not responded to immunomodulating drugs and corticosteroids, and for whom surgery is inappropriate. Since February 2015, it is also approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis where other treatments have not worked.

In Australia, infliximab is available through the PBS for Crohn&#x27;s disease treatment provided the patient has not responded to conventional treatment and has a severe case of the condition.

Johnson &amp; Johnson reported in its 2013 annual report, &quot;Remicade (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.4% of the Company&#x27;s total revenues for fiscal 2013.&quot;

Zymfentra was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2023.

<doc id="324474" wikidata="Q367056" url="?curid=324474" title="Ben Mulroney">
<text>Benedict Martin Paul Mulroney (born March 9, 1976) is a Canadian radio host and former television host. He is the eldest son of Brian Mulroney, the 18th Prime Minister of Canada.

Best known for his 20-year broadcasting career with the Canadian network CTV, Mulroney began as an entertainment reporter on CTV&#x27;s former morning show &quot;Canada AM&quot; in 2001, and co-hosted the entertainment news program &quot;etalk&quot; from 2002 to 2020, &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; from 2003 to 2008, and CTV&#x27;s national morning show &quot;Your Morning&quot; from 2016 to 2021. Mulroney departed etalk in June 2020. A year later, on September 29, 2021, Mulroney departed both &quot;Your Morning&quot; and CTV to pursue a producing career.

Mulroney currently hosts &quot;The Ben Mulroney Show&quot; mornings on 640 Toronto, syndicated nationally on Corus Entertainment&#x27;s talk radio stations.

==Early life and education==
Mulroney was born in Montreal, Quebec, and grew up in Ottawa, Ontario. He is the second of four children born to former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mila Pivnički Mulroney, who is of Serbian descent. Mulroney is one of several children of former Prime Ministers who became Canadian media personalities between 1998 and 2001. Moreover, just like his father, Ben Mulroney is fluent in both French and English.

His older sister, Caroline, is the President of the Treasury Board of Ontario and Minister of Francophone Affairs, having been an unsuccessful candidate for the 2018 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; later revealed that he helped her rehearse scripts during the leadership campaign.

Mulroney attended Lycée Claudel d&#x27;Ottawa and the Hotchkiss School, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree, with a major in history, from Duke University. He subsequently earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from Université Laval. During the Oliphant hearings, it was revealed that all the Mulroney children&#x27;s university educations were paid from the cash that their father received from Karlheinz Schreiber.

==Career==
In the late 1990s, Mulroney wrote a regular column for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;. He began his career as an entertainment reporter as the Quebec City correspondent for &quot;The Chatroom&quot; in 2000 on CTV-owned digital channel Talktv and became one of five co-hosts of the show in July 2001. From 2001 to 2002, he was entertainment reporter on &quot;Canada AM&quot;. He hosted &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; from 2003 to 2008.

===&quot;etalk&quot;===
Mulroney is best known as the former host of the entertainment news program &quot;etalk&quot; from 2002 to 2020, where he covered major events in entertainment, including the Oscars, the Golden Globes, and the Juno Awards.
In April 2009, Mulroney added radio show host to his résumé with the launch of the CHUM Radio show, &quot;etalk 20&quot;. The two-hour radio program was broadcast on 11 radio stations across Canada and counted down the top 20 chart-topping hits and includes celebrity interviews.

In 2006, he was appointed as the National Ambassador for UNICEF Canada. In February 2010, Mulroney and other staff from &quot;etalk&quot; covered the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games for CTV.

On June 22, 2020, Mulroney announced his resignation as host of &quot;etalk&quot; saying, &quot;More than ever, we need more Black voices, more Indigenous voices, more people of colour in the media as well as every other profession – and that is why I have decided to immediately step away from my role at &quot;etalk&quot; to create space for a new perspective and a new voice.&quot; His resignation came in the wake of a controversy in which his wife was accused of harassing Sasha Exeter, a black influencer.

===American career===
Mulroney joined ABC News in June 2012 as a contributor to &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Former ABC News President Ben Sherwood announced that Mulroney would be temporarily substituting for Dan Harris during the weekends, while serving as contributor to &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. This followed Mulroney&#x27;s previous stints as temporary co-host with Kelly Ripa on &quot;Live with Kelly&quot;.

===&quot;Your Morning&quot;===
In June 2016, he was announced as the cohost, with Anne-Marie Mediwake, of CTV&#x27;s new morning show &quot;Your Morning&quot;, which replaced the venerable &quot;Canada AM&quot;. He left the program, effective October 1, 2021, in order to &quot;pursue a career as a producer, developing unique projects for both Canadian and global audiences&quot;.

===&quot;The Ben Mulroney Show&quot;===
Mulroney has been an on-air contributor at 640 Toronto since October 2023. He appeared regularly on the station&#x27;s morning show, &quot;Toronto Today,&quot; as well as filling in for regular hosts such as Greg Brady and John Oakley when they were away. He hosted &quot;Toronto This Weekend&quot; until November 2024 when he became host of &quot;The Ben Mulroney Show&quot;, a mid-morning program on the station. The first hour focuses on issues local to the Greater Toronto Area and Ontario and is carried only on 640 Toronto and 980 CFPL in London, while the final two hours of the three-hour program are nationally syndicated on Corus Radio&#x27;s talk stations, and as well as airing live in Ontario, are carried in the afternoon or evening on 770 CHQR Calgary, 880 CHED Edmonton, 680 CJOB Winnipeg, and 980 CKNW Vancouver.

==Personal life==

Mulroney became engaged to his girlfriend of one year, fashion designer and stylist Jessica Brownstein, on December 28, 2007, in Montreal. They were married on October 30, 2008, in a private ceremony at St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica, Montreal. Mulroney first met Brownstein when they were both teenagers through his younger brother Mark, who was a student at the all-boys Selwyn House School during the same time she was a student at sister school Miss Edgar&#x27;s and Miss Cramp&#x27;s School.

They have three children: sons, who are fraternal twins, Brian Gerald Alexander Mulroney and John Benedict Dimitri Mulroney (born August 12, 2010) and daughter Isabel Veronica Mulroney known as &quot;Ivy&quot; (born June 12, 2013).

Ben and Jessica Mulroney attended the 2018 wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and their three children participated as page boys and bridesmaid.

<doc id="324479" wikidata="Q5505497" url="?curid=324479" title="From Ritual to Romance">
<text>From Ritual to Romance is a 1920 book written by Jessie Weston.

Weston&#x27;s book is an examination of the roots of the King Arthur legends. It seeks to make connections between the early pagan elements and the later Christian influences. The book&#x27;s main focus is on the Holy Grail tradition and its influence, particularly the Wasteland motif.

The origins of Weston&#x27;s book are in James George Frazer&#x27;s work on folklore, magic and religion, &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890), and in the works of Jane Ellen Harrison.

The work is mentioned by T. S. Eliot in the notes to his poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

<text>Colonoscopy () or coloscopy () is a medical procedure involving the endoscopic examination of the large bowel (colon) and the distal portion of the small bowel. This examination is performed using either a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera, which is mounted on a flexible tube and passed through the anus.

The purpose of a colonoscopy is to provide a visual diagnosis via inspection of the internal lining of the colon wall, which may include identifying issues such as ulceration or precancerous polyps, and to enable the opportunity for biopsy or the removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions.

Colonoscopy is similar in principle to sigmoidoscopy, with the primary distinction being the specific parts of the colon that each procedure can examine. The same instrument used for sigmoidoscopy performs the colonoscopy. A colonoscopy permits a comprehensive examination of the entire colon, which is typically around 1,200 to 1,500 millimeters in length. 

In contrast, a sigmoidoscopy allows for the examination of only the distal portion of the colon, which spans approximately 600 millimeters. This distinction is medically significant because the benefits of colonoscopy in terms of improving cancer survival have primarily been associated with the detection of lesions in the distal portion of the colon.

Routine use of colonoscopy screening varies globally. In the US, colonoscopy is a commonly recommended and widely utilized screening method for colorectal cancer, often beginning at age 45 or 50, depending on risk factors and guidelines from organizations like the American Cancer Society. However, screening practices differ worldwide. For example, in the European Union, several countries primarily employ fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) or sigmoidoscopy for population-based screening. These variations stem from differences in healthcare systems, policies, and cultural factors. Recent studies have stressed the need for screening strategies and awareness campaigns to combat colorectal cancer - on a global scale.

==Medical uses==

Conditions that call for colonoscopies include gastrointestinal hemorrhage, unexplained changes in bowel habit and suspicion of malignancy. Colonoscopies are often used to diagnose colon polyp and colon cancer, but are also frequently used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease. 

Another common indication for colonoscopy is the investigation of iron deficiency with or without anaemia. The examination of the colon, to rule out a lesion contributing to blood loss, along with an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (gastroscopy) to rule out oesophageal, stomach, and proximal duodenal sources of blood loss.

Fecal occult blood is a quick test which can be done to test for microscopic traces of blood in the stool. A positive test is almost always an indication to do a colonoscopy. In most cases the positive result is just due to hemorrhoids; however, it can also be due to diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis), colon cancer, or polyps. Colonic polypectomy has become a routine part of colonoscopy, allowing quick and simple removal of polyps during the procedure, without invasive surgery.

With regard to blood in the stool either visible or occult, it is worthy of note, that occasional rectal bleeding may have multiple non-serious potential causes.

===Colon cancer screening===
Colonoscopy is one of the colorectal cancer screening tests available to people in the US who are 45 years of age and older. The other screening tests include flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema, computed tomographic (CT) colonography (virtual colonoscopy), guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and multitarget stool DNA screening test (Cologuard).

Subsequent rescreenings are then scheduled based on the initial results found, with a five- or ten-year recall being common for colonoscopies that produce normal results. People with a family history of colon cancer are often first screened during their teenage years.
Among people who have had an initial colonoscopy that found no polyps, the risk of developing colorectal cancer within five years is extremely low. Therefore, there is no need for those people to have another colonoscopy sooner than five years after the first screening.

Some medical societies in the US recommend a screening colonoscopy every 10 years beginning at age 50 for adults without increased risk for colorectal cancer. Research shows that the risk of cancer is low for 10 years if a high-quality colonoscopy does not detect cancer, so tests for this purpose are indicated every ten years.

Colonoscopy screening is associated with approximately two-thirds fewer deaths due to colorectal cancers on the left side of the colon, and is not associated with a significant reduction in deaths from right-sided disease. It is speculated that colonoscopy might reduce rates of death from colon cancer by detecting some colon polyps and cancers on the left side of the colon early enough that they may be treated, and a smaller number on the right side.

Since polyps often take 10 to 15 years to transform into cancer in someone at average risk of colorectal cancer, guidelines recommend 10 years after a normal screening colonoscopy before the next colonoscopy. (This interval does not apply to people at high risk of colorectal cancer or those who experience symptoms of the disease.)

The large randomized pragmatic clinical trial NordICC was the first published trial on the use of colonoscopy as a screening test to prevent colorectal cancer, related death, and death from any cause. It included 84,585 healthy men and women aged 55 to 64 years in Poland, Norway, and Sweden, who were randomized to either receive an invitation to undergo a single screening colonoscopy (invited group) or to receive no invitation or screening (usual-care group). Of the 28,220 people in the invited group, 11,843 (42.0%) underwent screening. A total of 15 people who underwent colonoscopy (0.13%) had major bleeding after polyp removal.

None of the participants experienced a colon perforation due to colonoscopy. After 10 years, an intention-to-screen analysis showed a significant relative risk reduction of 18% in the risk of colorectal cancer (0.98% in the invited group vs. 1.20% in the usual-care group). The analysis showed no significant change in the risk of death from colorectal cancer (0.28% vs. 0.31%) or in the risk of death from any cause (11.03% vs. 11.04%). To prevent one case of colorectal cancer, 455 invitations to colonoscopy were required.

As of 2023, the CONFIRM trial, a randomized trial evaluating colonoscopy vs. FIT is currently ongoing.

In 2021, the US spent $43 billion on cancer screening to prevent five cancers, with colonoscopies accounting for 55% of the total. The death rate from colon cancer has been on a linear decline for 40 years, falling by nearly 50 percent from the 1980s (when few were screened) to 2024; however, the increase in screening did not accelerate the decline. Therefore, resources devoted to cancer screening would be better directed toward ensuring widespread access to effective cancer treatment.

In 2025, a recent study has revealed an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals diagnosed with both advanced and nonadvanced adenomas during colonoscopy. These findings emphasize the importance of surveillance colonoscopy and suggest that patients with advanced adenomas may require more frequent screenings. Researchers analyzed data from the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study and determined that individuals with adenomas—whether advanced or not—had a higher likelihood of developing CRC compared to those without adenomas. Additionally, the study indicated that those with advanced adenomas faced an elevated risk of CRC-related and overall mortality. 

===Recommendations===
The American Cancer Society issues recommendations on colorectal cancer screening guidelines. These guidelines often change and are updated as new studies and technologies have become available

Many other national organizations also issue such guidance, such as the UK&#x27;s NHS and various European agencies, guidance can vary between such agencies.

===Medicare coverage===
In the United States, Medicare insurance covers a number of colorectal-cancer screening tests.

==Procedural risks==
The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy estimates around three in 1,000 colonoscopies lead to serious complications.

===Perforation===
The most serious complication is generally gastrointestinal perforation, which is life-threatening and requires immediate surgical intervention.

The key to managing a colonoscopic perforation is diagnosis at the time. Typically, the reasons are that the bowel prep done to facilitate the examination acts to reduce the potential for contamination, resulting in a higher likelihood of conservative management. In addition, detection at the time allows the physician to deploy strategies to seal the colon, or mark it should the patient require surgery.

===Issues from general anesthesia===
As with any procedure involving anaesthesia, complications can occur, such as:
* allergic reactions,
* cardiovascular issues,
* paradoxical agitation,
* aspiration,
* dental injury.

===Colon preparation electrolyte issues===
Electrolyte imbalance caused by bowel preparation solutions is possible, but current bowel cleansing laxatives are formulated to account for electrolyte balance, making this a very rare event.

===Other===
During colonoscopies, when a polyp is removed (a polypectomy), the risk of complication increases. One of the most serious complications is postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome, occurring in 1 in procedures. It results from a burn injury to the wall of the colon causing abdominal pain, fever, elevated white blood cell count and elevated serum C-reactive protein. Treatment consists of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and avoiding oral intake of food, water, etc. until symptoms improve. Risk factors include right colon polypectomy, large polyp size (&gt;2 cm), non-polypoid lesions (laterally spreading lesions), and hypertension.

Although rare, infections of the colon are a potential colonoscopy risk. The colon is not a sterile environment, and infections can occur during biopsies from what is essentially a &#x27;small shallow cut&#x27;, enabling bacterial intrusion into lower parts of the colon wall. In cases where the lining of the colon is perforated, bacteria can infiltrate the abdominal cavity. Infection may also be introduced if the endoscope is not cleaned and sterilized appropriately between procedures.

Minor colonoscopy risks may include nausea, vomiting or allergies to the sedatives that may have been used. If medication is given intravenously, the vein may become irritated, or mild phlebitis may occur.

==Technique==

===Preparation===
The colon must be free of solid matter for the test to be performed properly. For one to three days, the patient is required to follow a low fiber or clear-liquid-only diet. Examples of clear fluids are apple juice, chicken and/or beef broth or bouillon, lemon-lime soda, lemonade, sports drink, and water. It is important that the patient remains hydrated. Sports drinks contain electrolytes which are depleted during the purging of the bowel. Drinks containing fiber such as prune and orange juice should not be consumed, nor should liquids dyed red, purple, orange, or sometimes brown; however, cola is allowed. In most cases, tea or coffee taken without milk are allowed.

The day before the colonoscopy (or colorectal surgery), the patient is either given a laxative preparation (such as bisacodyl, phospho soda, sodium picosulfate, or sodium phosphate and/or magnesium citrate) and large quantities of fluid, or whole bowel irrigation is performed using a solution of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes. The procedure may involve both a pill-form laxative and a bowel irrigation preparation with the polyethylene glycol powder dissolved into any clear liquid, such as a sports drink that contains electrolytes.

The patient may be asked not to take aspirin or similar products such as salicylate, ibuprofen, etc. for up to ten days before the procedure to avoid the risk of bleeding if a polypectomy is performed during the procedure. A blood test may be performed before the procedure.

===Procedure===
During the procedure, the patient is often given sedation intravenously, employing agents such as fentanyl or midazolam. Although meperidine (Demerol) may be used as an alternative to fentanyl, the concern of seizures has relegated this agent to second choice for sedation behind the combination of fentanyl and midazolam. The average person will receive a combination of these two drugs, usually between 25 and 100μg IV fentanyl and 1–4mg IV midazolam. Sedation practices vary between practitioners and nations; in some clinics in Norway, sedation is rarely administered.

The first step is usually a digital rectal examination (DRE), to examine the tone of the anal sphincter and to determine if preparation has been adequate. A DRE is also useful in detecting anal neoplasms and the clinician may note issues with the prostate gland in men undergoing this procedure. The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon (sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending colon, the cecum), and ultimately the terminal ileum. The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure that gives the patient the false sensation of needing to take a bowel movement). Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as indigo carmine) may be sprayed through the endoscope onto the bowel wall to help visualize any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumors in the colon and rectum.

In most experienced hands, the endoscope is advanced to the junction of where the colon and small bowel join up (cecum) in under 10 minutes in 95% of cases. Due to tight turns and redundancy in areas of the colon that are not &quot;fixed&quot;, loops may form in which advancement of the endoscope creates a &quot;bowing&quot; effect that causes the tip to actually retract. These loops often result in discomfort due to stretching of the colon and its associated mesentery. Manoeuvres to &quot;reduce&quot; or remove the loop include pulling the endoscope backwards while twisting it. Alternatively, body position changes and abdominal support from external hand pressure can often &quot;straighten&quot; the endoscope to allow the scope to move forward. In a minority of patients, looping is often cited as a cause for an incomplete examination. Usage of alternative instruments leading to completion of the examination has been investigated, including use of pediatric colonoscope, push enteroscope and upper GI endoscope variants.

Lawsuits over missed cancerous lesions have recently prompted some institutions to better document endoscope examination times, as rapid examination times may be a source of potential medical legal liability. This is often a real concern in clinical settings where high caseloads could provide financial incentive to complete colonoscopies as quickly as possible.

===Patient comfort and pain management===
The pain associated with the procedure is not caused by the insertion of the scope but rather by the inflation of the colon in order to do the inspection. The scope itself is essentially a long, flexible tube about a centimeter in diameter — that is, as big around as the little finger, which is less than the diameter of an average stool.

The colon is wrinkled and corrugated, somewhat like an accordion or a clothes-dryer exhaust tube, which gives it the large surface area needed for nutrition and water absorption. In order to inspect this surface thoroughly, the physician blows it up like a balloon, using air from a compressor or carbon dioxide from a gas bottle (CO2 is absorbed into the bloodstream through the mucosal lining of the colon much faster than air and then exhaled through the lungs which is associated with less post procedural pain), in order to get the creases out.

The colon has sensors that can tell when there is unexpected gas pushing the colon walls out—which may cause mild discomfort. Usually, total anesthesia or a partial twilight sedative are used to reduce the patient&#x27;s awareness of pain or discomfort, or just the unusual sensations of the procedure. Once the colon has been inflated, the doctor inspects it with the scope as it is slowly pulled backward. If any polyps are found they are then cut out for later biopsy.

Colonoscopy can be carried out without any sedation and a number of studies have been performed evaluating colonoscopy outcomes without sedation. Though in the US and EU the procedure is usually carried out with some form of sedation.

==Economics==
Researchers have found that older patients with three or more significant health problems (i.e., dementia or heart failure) had higher rates of repeat colonoscopies without medical indications. These patients are less likely to live long enough to develop colon cancer.

==History==
In the 1960s, Niwa and Yamagata at Tokyo University developed the fibre-optic endoscopy device. After 1968, William Wolff and Hiromi Shinya pioneered the development of the colonoscope. Their invention, in 1969 in Japan, was a significant advance over the barium enema and the flexible sigmoidoscope because it allowed for the visualization and removal of polyps from the entire colon. Wolff and Shinya advocated for their invention and published much of the early evidence needed to overcome skepticism about the device&#x27;s safety and efficacy.

Some of the leading medical device companies in the colonoscopy market as of 2023 include: Fujifilm, Karl Storz SE, Pro Scope Systems, Olympus Corporation, Medtronic Plc, Steris and Pentax Medical.

===Etymology===
The terms &quot;colonoscopy&quot; or &quot;coloscopy&quot; are derived from the ancient Greek noun κόλον, same as English &quot;colon&quot;, and the verb σκοπεῖν, &quot;look (in)to&quot;, &quot;examine&quot;. The term &quot;colonoscopy&quot; is however ill-constructed, as this form supposes that the first part of the compound consists of a possible root κολων- or κολον-, with the connecting vowel -o, instead of the root κόλ- of κόλον. A compound such as κολωνοειδής, &quot;like a hill&quot;, (with the additional -on-) is derived from the ancient Greek word κολώνη or κολωνός, &quot;hill&quot;. Similarly, colonoscopy (with the additional -on-) can literally be translated as &quot;examination of the hill&quot;, instead of the &quot;examination of the colon&quot;.

In English, multiple words exist that are derived from κόλον, such as &quot;colectomy&quot;, &quot;colocentesis&quot;, &quot;colopathy&quot;, and &quot;colostomy&quot; among many others, that actually lack the incorrect additional -on-. A few compound words such as &quot;colonopathy&quot; have doublets with -on- inserted.

==Society and culture==
The procedure of colonoscopy gained national attention in the United States in 1985 when President Ronald Reagan underwent a life-saving colonoscopy.

A survey on colonoscopy shows a poor understanding of its protective value and widespread misconceptions. The public has perceptual gaps around the purpose of colonoscopies, the subjective experience of the colonoscopy procedure, and the quantity of bowel preparation needed.

Actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have used their social media platform to raise awareness about the importance of colonoscopy as a procedure for colon cancer screening. They filmed their own colonoscopies as part of a campaign called &quot;Lead From Behind&quot;, demonstrating that the procedure can be both easy and lifesaving.

<doc id="324483" wikidata="Q466675" url="?curid=324483" title="American Renaissance">
<text>The American Renaissance was a period of American architecture and the arts from 1876 to 1917, characterized by renewed national self-confidence and a feeling that the United States was the heir to Greek democracy, Roman law, and Renaissance humanism. Local conditions and requirements of America, including the aforementioned nationalism, spurred this change of style, allowing it to slowly developed over time in various places around the United States. The era spans the period between the Centennial Exposition (celebrating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence) and the United States&#x27; entry into World War I.

== Building materials ==
The early building material for the structures of the American Renaissance was wood, the United States&#x27; great national building commodity of the time given its plentiful availability. Due to a lack of money for the fairly new country, stone, the material used by the Greeks and Romans, was out of reach. Columns were initially carved of wood for the earliest structures of this period. With an increase of national wealth, architects and builders were able to begin using white marble, a more durable material, for intricate carvings and details.

Both materials had their benefits. Wood is more easily repaired and replaced given its lack of lengthy durability in addition to its charm, warmth, and personality, which is characteristic of the American style. Stone, especially white marble, has a shine and glow to it. It is also more durable and able to withstand harsh weather conditions.

Decorative elements, such as arches, domes, vaulted ceilings, and columns were commonplace during the American Renaissance. There was a strong desire for the revival of Classical forms, symmetrical designs, and elaborate decorative elements. A sense of national identity was created and explored through the use of local materials and motifs.

Structures of the American Renaissance were made using both building materials, with early ones more commonly being entirely done in wood and painted. A great variety of buildings were made using this style, such as townhouses, cottages, state houses, libraries, capitol buildings, museums, banks, railway terminals, and more.

==Characteristics==
During the period of the American Renaissance, the United States&#x27; preoccupation with national identity (or New Nationalism) was expressed by modernism and technology, as well as academic classicism. This classicism made way for a new form of creative and artistic rhetoric, which in turn helped establish the new aesthetic of the time. It expressed its self-confidence in new technologies, such as the wire cables of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. It found its cultural outlets in Prairie School houses and in Beaux-Arts architecture and sculpture, in the &quot;City Beautiful&quot; movement, and in the creation of the American empire. A goal of the &quot;City Beautiful&quot; movement, which coincides with the American Renaissance, was, &quot;to shape American culture and society aesthetically, morally, and professionally&quot;. Through this goal, order, acculturation, and assimilation were meant to be brought to the American city, easing the transition for immigrants while also establishing a professional authority through architecture. Americans felt that their civilization was uniquely the modern heir, and that it had come of age. Politically and economically, this era coincides with the Gilded Age and the New Imperialism.

The classical architecture of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois in 1893 was a demonstration that impressed Henry Adams, who wrote that people &quot;would some day talk about Hunt and Richardson, La Farge and Saint-Gaudens, Burnham and McKim and Stanford White, when their politicians and millionaires were quite forgotten.&quot; Praise for this exhibition included the unity and consistency of the symmetrical structures, which inspired many of Charles McKim&#x27;s campus projects, a mall, and other buildings in the city center of Washington D.C. In 1909, the year of McKim&#x27;s death, his architectural firm was the largest in the world, having produced nearly 900 buildings of Classical orders and finely proportioned masonry.

In the dome of the reading room at the new Library of Congress, Edwin Blashfield&#x27;s murals were on the given theme, &quot;The Evolution of Civilization.&quot;

The exhibition &quot;American Renaissance: 1876–1917&quot; at the Brooklyn Museum, 1979, encouraged the revival of interest in this movement.

==Notable examples==

*Cuyahoga County Courthouse (1906–1912): the exterior includes sculpture by Karl Bitter, Daniel Chester French, Herbert Adams, Isidore Konti and Herman Matzen, while the interior contains murals by Frank Brangwyn, Violet Oakley, Charles Yardley Turner, Max Bohm and Frederick Wilson. A stained glass window was designed and executed by Frederick Wilson and Charles Schweinfurth.
*San Francisco City Hall (completed 1915): designed by Arthur Brown, Jr, who also designed several other buildings in the style in San Francisco, including the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, Veterans Building, Temple Emanuel, Coit Tower and the Federal office building at 50 United Nations Plaza.
*The Boston Public Library (1888-1895): designed and created by Charles McKim, inspired by the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris, among other Classical structures. The interior contains a grand vaulted, coffered ceiling, lavish decorative elements, and large windows which provide natural light.
*The Metropolitan Museum of Art (1870s-1910): designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould, with work later done by Richard Morris Hunt and his son, Richard Howland Hunt, and the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White. This grand museum, being the fourth largest in the world, displays the American Renaissance style with its arched windows, grand columns, and lavish decorative elements present on the main facade and lobby.



The above images, displaying the notable example buildings, all contain architectural elements of the American Renaissance.

<text>Jane Bowles (; born Jane Sydney Auer; February 22, 1917 – May 4, 1973) was an American writer and playwright.

==Early life==
Born into a Jewish family in New York City on February 22, 1917, to Sydney Auer (father) and Claire Stajer (mother), Jane Bowles spent her childhood in Woodmere, New York, on Long Island. She had had a bad knee from birth, which was later broken from falling off a horse when she was a teenager. After knee surgery, she developed tuberculous arthritis, and her mother took her to Switzerland for treatment, where she attended boarding school. She also attended Julia Richmond High School in New York and the Stoneleigh School for Girls in Greenfield, Massachusetts.

At this point in her life, she developed a passion for literature coupled with insecurities. She developed phobias related to dogs, sharks, mountains, jungles, and elevators as well as fears of being burned alive. During the mid-1930s she returned to New York, where she gravitated to the intellectual bohemia of Greenwich Village.

She married the composer and writer Paul Bowles in 1938. The location of the honeymoon inspired the setting for her novel &quot;Two Serious Ladies&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bowles had a rich love life. In 1937, she and Paul Bowles were introduced to each other by Erika Mann, and in the following year (1938), they were married and went on a honeymoon in Central America. She visited lesbian bars while they traveled together in Paris. The marriage was a sexual marriage for about a year and a half. Thereafter, Jane and Paul were platonic companions. They both were bisexual, and mainly preferred to have sex outside of their marriage.

After this, Jane and Paul went to Mexico, where Jane later met Helvetia Perkins (1895–1965), who became her lover.

==Career==
In 1943, her novel &quot;Two Serious Ladies&quot; was published. The Bowleses lived in New York until 1947, when Paul moved to Tangier, Morocco; Jane followed him in 1948. While in Morocco, Jane had an intense, complicated relationship with a Moroccan woman named Cherifa. She also had a close relationship with the torch singer Libby Holman. Holman was attracted to both Jane and Paul, but Paul did not reciprocate.

Jane Bowles wrote the play &quot;In the Summer House&quot;, performed on Broadway in 1953 to mixed reviews. Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, and John Ashbery all highly praised her work.

==&quot;In the Summer House&quot;==
&quot;In the Summer House&quot; was her only full-length play. It was first performed in 1951 in the Hedgerow Theater in Moylan, Pennsylvania. The play opened on Broadway at the Playhouse Theatre on December 29, 1953, with music by Paul Bowles, where it ran for two months to mixed reviews and low attendance. Around 1963, the play was revived. The play was revived again in 1993 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater with incidental music by Philip Glass. This revival received nominations for the 1994 Drama Desk Awards for outstanding director of a play, set design, and supporting actress (JoAnne Akalaitis, George Tsypin, and Frances Conroy, respectively).

The overarching plot is the comparison of an overbearing mother and gentle daughter and a gentle mother and an overbearing daughter. The plot is driven by character interaction and not action. It begins with a monologue by Ms. Gertude Eastman Cuevas, an isolated widow from Southern California who marries a rich Mexican (with a singing and dancing comrade), who is oppressive towards her daughter. The other widow is Ms. Constable and her challenging daughter. The daughters are both unstable.

Miss Cuevas has a suitor which makes the mother feel like she needs to be more overbearing. The first act closes on Ms. Cuevas and her new husband reading newspaper silently.

The second act occurs in a restaurant named The Lobster Bowl and uses intensive food imagery. Bowles&#x27;s complex relationship with her mother could have been an inspiration for the plot.

==Death==
Bowles, who was an alcoholic, suffered a stroke in 1957 at age 40. The stroke affected her sight and mental capacity, but she pushed through her health problems and continued to write. Her health continued to decline despite various treatments in England and the United States until she had to be admitted to a clinic in Málaga, Spain, where she died in 1973, at age 56.

==Legacy==
In Paul Bowles&#x27; semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, the characters Port and Kit Moresby were based on him and his wife. Debra Winger played Kit in the film adaptation of the novel. Although Bowles&#x27; literary output was not substantial in terms of volume, she was highly respected, with Truman Capote calling her &quot;one of the really original pure stylists&quot; and Tennessee Williams calling her &quot;the most important writer of prose fiction in modern American letters.&quot;

<doc id="324489" wikidata="Q1372559" url="?curid=324489" title="Canadian Idol">
<text>Canadian Idol is a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the &quot;roving reporter&quot; for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six.

The show began with a cross-Canada tour in which singers audition in front of four judges: Jake Gold of Toronto, Sass Jordan of Montreal, Quebec, Zack Werner of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Farley Flex of Ajax, Ontario. Eventually the performers were narrowed down to 10 finalists (11 in season one due to a near-tie), with each competitor performing live. Viewers had two hours following the broadcast of the show to phone in their votes for their favourite competitor. On the following night&#x27;s episode (live again), the competitor with the fewest votes was sent home. After the final two perform, viewers had more than two hours to vote. The next day (five days later in season 4; two days later in season 6), the competitor with the most votes was declared the winner. The show was taped at the John Bassett Theatre in Toronto, Ontario.

In December 2008, CTV announced that &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; would be &quot;suspended&quot;, not airing in the 2009 season due to &quot;the current economic climate&quot;. At that time, the network stated that it expected the show would return in 2010. However, CTV has not made any further announcement regarding the series since that time, and the series is now generally considered to have been cancelled. Following the announcement of the show&#x27;s suspension, Joel Rubinoff, television critic for the &quot;Waterloo Region Record&quot;, strongly criticized the show&#x27;s direction, declaring that it had &quot;bottomed out creatively in every possible way&quot; and &quot;outlived its usefulness&quot;.

== Final results ==

In its six seasons, the winners and runners-up were:
==Season 1==
In the first season, which debuted on June 9, 2003, Ryan Malcolm of Kingston, Ontario won, with Gary Beals of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia coming in second. Malcolm released his debut album entitled &quot;Home&quot; in October 2003, which included his first single from &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;: &quot;Something More&quot;. In fact, eight members of the Season One Top 11 have now released their own solo albums, including Gary Beals, Billy Klippert, Audrey De Montigny, Jenny Gear, Toya Alexis, Mikey Bustos, and Karen Lee Batten.

Auditions were held in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary, Winnipeg, Halifax, and St. John&#x27;s.

==Season 2==
The second season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; debuted on June 1, 2004, and became the most-watched show in Canada, drawing in over 3 million viewers each week.

Auditions were held in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Halifax, Regina, and St. John&#x27;s. The season provided an &quot;Idol&quot; franchise first when the final six contestants played their own instruments during a group performance of the Gordon Lightfoot classic &quot;Canadian Railroad Trilogy&quot;.

Kalan Porter of Medicine Hat, Alberta won the series, and Theresa Sokyrka of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan was the runner-up. In November 2004, merely two months after the competition, Porter released his debut album entitled &quot;219 Days&quot; – the number of days spanning from his first audition to the release of his CD. It was certified double platinum within two months and he received three Juno nominations. Porter also won Fan Favourite Canadian Artist at the MuchMusic Video Awards. Other competitors from Season Two&#x27;s Top 10 who have released albums include: Sokyrka, Jacob Hoggard (four albums with his band Hedley), Jason Greeley, Shane Wiebe, and Joshua Seller. Porter is the first CI winner to have a second CD released by Sony BMG (&quot;Wake Up Living&quot; launched August 28, 2007). Jacob Hoggard released his second album (Universal) with his band, Hedley; the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;She&#x27;s So Sorry&quot;, was released to radio August 20, 2007.

==Season 3==
In December 2004, CTV announced that they would be producing a third season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; in 2005. Auditions began in February and finished in April 2005 and the show debuted May 30, just days after the conclusion of the fourth season of &quot;American Idol&quot; but did not follow suit yet on the new change to that show.

Auditions were held in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary, Winnipeg, London, Sudbury, Saskatoon, St. John&#x27;s, Moncton, Charlottetown, Sydney, and Whitehorse.

This season introduced a twist in the Wildcard semi-final round. On the group 4 results show, after the results were revealed, 11 previous competitors were brought out. (CTV had advertised the broadcast as having 12 competitors, but one dropped out at the last minute.) The judges expressed how they felt about each competitor, and each competitor had a chance to show why they should sing in the Wildcard, whether it be through song or a plea. Then, the public had a chance to vote which would decide which of the 11 competitors would sing in the Wildcard.

After the final, Melissa O&#x27;Neil of Calgary, Alberta was crowned the winner; with Rex Goudie of Burlington, Newfoundland and Labrador the runner-up. Melissa O&#x27;Neil, Rex Goudie, Aaron Walpole, and Suzi Rawn have released albums; while Casey LeBlanc, Ashley Leitao and Amber Fleury have released an album as a group called Braided. Josh Palmer is also working on an album release.

==Season 4==
In January 2006, CTV announced their plans for a fourth season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;. An 11-week audition tour took place in February, March and April 2006. Auditions were held in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Kitchener-Waterloo, Halifax, Regina, St. John&#x27;s, and Yellowknife. Season two competitor Elena Juatco joined the show as the roving reporter, while Jon Dore did not return for the fourth season. The season premiered on May 29, five days after the finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; Season 5. The season finale of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; took place on Sunday, September 17, 2006. The finale, originally scheduled for Tuesday, September 12, was moved to help resolve a conflict with ABC&#x27;s &#x27;Dancing with the Stars&#x27;, which CTV also carried and which ABC announced would debut September 12. Eva Avila took the title in the closest final vote to date; CTV announced that 3.3% -- which amounted to 131,000 votes—separated her from Newfoundland&#x27;s Craig Sharpe.

On Saturday, September 16, 2006, a day prior to the public announcement of the &quot;Idol&quot; results, Sony BMG Music Entertainment began offering Avila&#x27;s version of the first single, &quot;Meant to Fly&quot;, for sale on the website EvaAvila.com. Although the page was subsequently blanked, the artwork for the single can currently be located within the image files of the webpage. This occurrence led to the creation of many rumours regarding the winner of the competition. Both Avila&#x27;s and Sharpe&#x27;s singles were made available for pre-order for the September 26, 2006 release date on Amazon.

As of 2009, Eva Avila (&#x27;Somewhere Else&#x27; and &#x27;Give Me the Music&#x27;), Craig Sharpe (&#x27;I Am&#x27;), Chad Doucette (&#x27;Hit It&#x27;), Tyler Lewis (&#x27;I&#x27;m Coming Home&#x27;), and Brandon Jones (&#x27;All for You&#x27;) had all launched debut CDs.

==Season 5==

In December 2006, CTV announced the plans for the fifth season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;. The audition tour began in Vancouver on February 3, and visited nine more cities across Canada in a 10-week trip. This year, the network announced that the auditioners can play along with their instrument in their audition. The network also indicated that Dave Kerr will replace Elena Juatco in the co-hosting role for Season Five. Season Five premiered on June 5, 2007. On July 11, 2007 &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; voters picked their top ten. On September 4, 2007 these were narrowed down to the final two, Jaydee Bixby and Brian Melo. On September 11, 2007, Brian Melo was voted the winner. Placing 3rd was Carly Rae Jepsen, globally the best selling &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; alum to-date. 

==Season 6==

In January 2008, CTV announced the plans for the sixth season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;. The sixth season held auditions in Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Hamilton, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, St. John&#x27;s, and Toronto. In addition to the auditions, contestants who failed to advance to the next round or were unable to make it to an audition on the scheduled date were able to audition via cyberspace by uploading their 2-minute audition to the show&#x27;s website. This was the first season to feature a top 24 instead of top 22 along with an uneven number of men and women in the cast. The Canadian voters selected their Top 10 on July 9, 2008, and chose Theo Tams as the winner in the finale, which aired September 10.

<text>Max Shachtman (; September 10, 1904 – November 4, 1972) was an American Marxist theorist. He went from being an associate of Leon Trotsky to a social democrat and mentor of senior assistants to AFL–CIO President George Meany.

==Beginnings==

Shachtman was born to a Jewish family in Warsaw, Poland, which was then part of the Russian Empire. He emigrated with his family to New York City in 1905.

At an early age, he became interested in Marxism and was sympathetic to the radical wing of the Socialist Party. Having dropped out of City College, in 1921 he joined the Workers Council, a Communist organization led by J.B. Salutsky and Alexander Trachtenberg which was sharply critical of the underground form of organization of the Communist Party of America. At the end of December 1921 the Communist Party launched a &quot;legal political party,&quot; the Workers Party of America, of which the Workers&#x27; Council was a constituent member. Shachtman thereby joined the official communist movement by virtue of the Workers&#x27; Council&#x27;s dissolution by merger.

Shachtman was persuaded by Martin Abern to move to Chicago to become an organizer for the communist youth organization and edit the &quot;Young Worker&quot;. After joining the Communist Party, he rose to become an alternate member of its Central Committee. He edited &quot;Labor Defender&quot;, a journal of International Labor Defense, which he made the first photographic magazine on the U.S. left. As editor of &quot;Labor Defender&quot; he fought to save anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti from execution, speaking at street-corner meetings that were broken up again and again by police.

Through most of his time in the Communist Party Shachtman, along with Abern, associated with a group led by James P. Cannon. Central in the party leadership from 1923 to 1925 but pushed aside due to the influence of the Communist International (Comintern), the Cannon group became in 1928 supporters of Leon Trotsky.

==Trotskyist leader==
Shachtman, Cannon and Abern were expelled from the Communist Party in October 1928 as Joseph Stalin took control of the Comintern. These three and a handful of others formed a group around a newspaper called &quot;The Militant&quot;. Winning new support, including an important group of trade unionists in Minneapolis, the group shortly thereafter formed the Trotskyist Communist League of America (CLA). As Tim Wohlforth notes, Shachtman was already noted as a talented journalist and intellectual: &quot;The Militant&quot; listed Shachtman as its managing editor. Shachtman took up a series of positions as a journalist, which allowed him the time and resources to bring the American Trotskyists into contact with their co-thinkers. The CLA often gave him responsibility for contact and correspondence with Trotskyists in other countries. While holidaying in Europe during 1930, he became the first American to visit Trotsky in exile, on an island called Prinkipo in Russian, one of the Princes&#x27; Islands near Istanbul, Turkey. He attended the first European conference of the International Left Opposition in April 1930 and represented the CLA on the International Bureau of the ILO.

Shachtman&#x27;s working relationship with Abern was strengthened in 1929 and 1930. They invited Albert Glotzer, already an old friend and political colleague of Shachtman from their days as leaders of the Communist youth organization, to work with them.

Shachtman&#x27;s journalistic and linguistic skills allowed him to become a successful popularizer and translator of Trotsky&#x27;s work and to help found and run the Trotskyists&#x27; publishing house, Pioneer Press. He was known for the liberal use of humor and sarcasm in his polemical speeches. A division of labor developed within the CLA in which Cannon led the organization while Shachtman directed its literature and international relations.

===Differences with Cannon and Trotsky===

Frictions between Shachtman and Cannon, especially over Shachtman&#x27;s work when representing the League in Europe, broke out into a factional struggle in 1932. Trotsky and other leaders of the International Left Opposition complained to the CLA that Shachtman had intervened against them within the ILO&#x27;s fragile European affiliates.

These tensions were amplified by the social differences within the leadership: the older trade unionists supported Cannon; Shachtman and his allies Abern, Albert Glotzer and Maurice Spector were young intellectuals. Stanton and Tabor explain that the CLA&#x27;s modest progress also increased the frustration between the factions. During this time, Cannon experienced a spell of depression, during which the CLA&#x27;s organizing secretary was Abern while Shachtman worked on &quot;The Militant&quot;. Writing in 1936, Shachtman would criticize Abern&#x27;s habit of nourishing secret cliques of friends and supporters by supplying them with insider information about debates in the League&#x27;s leadership. Wohlforth&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; reports a factional battle upon Cannon&#x27;s return, in which the Minneapolis branch successfully backed Cannon&#x27;s return to leadership against Abern and Shachtman. Glotzer&#x27;s memoir mentions age as a factor: Cannon and other leaders were older than Shachtman, Abern, Maurice Spector, and himself. It was only a sharp intervention by the ILO in 1933 that ended the fight. Although the line-up of opponents largely anticipated Shachtman&#x27;s 1940 split from the mainstream Trotskyists, the years from 1933 to 1938 restored the co-operation between Cannon and Shachtman.

In 1933, in an internal party document entitled &quot;Communism and the Negro Question,&quot; Shachtman dissented from Trotsky&#x27;s view that Black self-determination was a transitional demand for recruiting Black workers in the United States to a socialist program, a position that was later more fully developed by C.L.R. James. His views, later published by Verso as &quot;Race and Revolution&quot; in 2003, launched the doctrine of revolutionary integrationism within the U.S. Marxist movement, later to be further developed by Daniel Guérin, Richard S. Fraser, and James Robertson. &quot;Race and Revolution&quot; was harshly critical of what it saw as white and Black reformism both within and outside the Socialist and Communist Left; it criticized the &quot;petty bourgeois&quot; proposals of major Black figures such as W.E.B. du Bois and NAACP official Walter Francis White, believing they rested on narrow, class-bound visions of Black progress.

===Workers&#x27; Party Merger===
Early in 1933, Shachtman and Glotzer traveled to Europe. While in Britain, the pair were able to meet with Reg Groves and other members of the recently formed Communist League with whom Shachtman had corresponded. When Trotsky&#x27;s household moved to France in July 1933, Shachtman accompanied them on their journey from Turkey.

The Trotskyists expanded their role in the U.S. labor movement through their leadership of the 1934 Minneapolis Teamster strike, which broadened into a citywide general strike. Important to the strike&#x27;s victory was the strike daily &quot;The Organizer&quot;; although Farrell Dobbs was listed on its masthead as the editor, Shachtman wrote much of it and organized its production. The Trotskyists&#x27; role in Minneapolis brought them closer to A. J. Muste&#x27;s American Workers Party, which had played a similar role in the Toledo general strike that same year.

In 1934, after the CLA merged with the AWP to form the U.S. Workers Party, Shachtman began editing the party&#x27;s new theoretical journal, &quot;New International&quot;. During this time, he wrote a notable booklet on the Moscow Trials and translated Leon Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;The Stalin School of Falsification&quot; (in 1937) and his &quot;Problems of the Chinese Revolution&quot; (originally published in 1932).

When the development of the WP was cut short by the rapid growth of the Socialist Party, George Breitman recalls that Shachtman and Cannon successfully proposed that the U.S. Workers Party, should dissolve, so that its members could recruit to Trotskyism from inside the Socialist Party.

===The Fourth International===
After the Trotskyists were expelled from the SP in 1937, Shachtman became a leader of their new organization, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Shachtman gave the report on the political situation at the SWP&#x27;s 1938 convention. The SWP included socialists like James Burnham who had come from A. J. Muste&#x27;s party rather than from the Trotskyist tradition. At the SWP&#x27;s founding congress, Burnham proposed that the USSR was no longer a degenerated workers&#x27; state: Shachtman spoke for the majority view that it remained a workers&#x27; state, and considered it important enough to hold a vote by roll call on the resolution. In March 1938, Shachtman and Cannon were part of a delegation sent to Mexico City to discuss the draft &quot;Transitional Program&quot; of the Fourth International with Trotsky: they would later teach a series of classes together in New York about the Program.

Shachtman came into closer contact with other left-wing intellectuals in or around the SWP, including James Burnham, Dwight Macdonald and the group around &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. Shachtman became a focal point for many in the milieu of the New York Intellectuals.

In the same period Shachtman worked with Trotsky on international issues, arranging Trotsky&#x27;s move from Norway to Mexico and playing a prominent role at several Trotskyist conferences that Trotsky could not attend. When the first congress of the Fourth International met in a village outside Paris in 1938, Shachtman led its presiding committee.

In January 1938, as editor of the SWP weekly, &quot;Socialist Appeal,&quot; Shachtman had given front-page coverage (&quot;Boss Court Holds Beal on Old Score&quot;) to a campaign to prevent recommittal of Fred Beal in North Carolina where he had been convicted in 1929 for conspiracy in the strike-related death of a policeman. Beal, returned from exile in the Soviet Union, had just published a memoir, &quot;Proletarian Journey&quot;, in which he identified the Soviet party-state bureaucracy as a &quot;new exploiting class&quot;, a formula Shachtman was later to adopt.

===Break with Trotsky===
In 1938, Shachtman shocked Trotsky by publishing an article in the &quot;New International&quot; in which James Burnham declared his opposition to dialectical materialism, the philosophy of Marxism. Although Trotsky reassured Shachtman, &quot;I did not deny in the least the usefulness of the article you and Burnham wrote,&quot; the issue would soon be revived as Shachtman and Trotsky clashed on the outbreak of World War II.

Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (August 23, 1939, a non-aggression treaty between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union), the combined invasion of Poland (September 1 – October 6, 1939) resulted in German and Soviet occupation of Poland. Inside the SWP, Shachtman and James Burnham argued in response that the SWP should drop its traditional position of unconditional defense of the USSR in war. The differences intensified with the outbreak of the Winter War (November 30, 1939 – March 12, 1940), when the Soviet Union invaded Finland. Shachtman and his allies broke with Cannon and the majority of the SWP leadership, which along with Trotsky continued to uphold unconditional critical defense of the USSR.

A bitter dispute opened up in the SWP. The case against Burnham and Shachtman&#x27;s position is reflected in books by Cannon and Trotsky. Trotsky was especially critical of Shachtman&#x27;s role as a member of the International Executive Committee of the Fourth International. At the start of World War II, the Fourth International was placed under the control of a resident committee formed by IEC members who happened to be in New York City. Shachtman&#x27;s tendency held a majority of the resident IEC. Trotsky and others criticized Shachtman for failing to convene the resident IEC or using its authority to reduce the tensions developing in the SWP.

A year into the debate, a special convention was held in April 1940. After the April 1940 convention of the SWP, when Shachtman and his supporters on the new Political Committee refused to a vote on a motion pledging each member to abide by the convention decisions, they were expelled from the party. The minority excluded from the SWP represented 40% of its membership and a majority of the youth group. Even before the Workers Party was formally founded, James Burnham resigned from membership and renounced Marxism, and adopted the position of &quot;evolutionary&quot; or moral socialism. Many of those who had left the SWP did not join the Workers&#x27; Party: according to George Novack, a member of the Cannon/Trotsky faction, around half did.

==Political evolution==

While Cannon and his allies regarded the Soviet Union as a &quot;degenerated workers&#x27; state&quot;, Shachtman and his party argued that the Stalinist bureaucracy was following an imperialist policy in Eastern Europe. After a four-sided debate in 1940–41 in the new Workers Party between advocates of different theories, a majority concluded that the bureaucracy had become a new ruling class in a society they called &quot;bureaucratic collectivist.&quot;

Alongside the WP&#x27;s paper &quot;Labor Action&quot;, Shachtman continued to edit &quot;New International&quot;, the Trotskyist magazine which his supporters had taken with them on resigning from the SWP.

===The development of the &quot;Third Camp&quot;===
In the early 1940s, Shachtman further developed the idea, already used by Trotskyists in the 1930s, of a &quot;Third Camp,&quot; an independent revolutionary force, made up of the world working class, movements resisting fascism and colonial peoples in rebellion, that would side neither with the Axis nor the Allies. Beginning in 1943, he predicted that the Soviet army would impose Stalinism in Eastern Europe, and added democratic resistance to Stalinism to his conception of the Third Camp. By 1948, Shachtman regarded capitalism and Stalinism to be equal impediments to socialism. Shachtman&#x27;s Workers Party became active in union struggles. Although its influence in the labor movement remained limited, it played a central role in the fight against the wartime no-strike pledge in the United Auto Workers. Shachtman was present in Grand Rapids for the 1944 UAW convention, helped convince its Rank and File Caucus to stand fast against the no-strike pledge, and felt triumphant when a convention majority voted the pledge down.

In 1949, Shachtman&#x27;s group dropped its self-description as a &quot;party&quot; and became the Independent Socialist League (ISL). The WP/ISL attracted many young intellectuals, including Michael Harrington, Irving Howe, Hal Draper, and Julius Jacobson. Shachtman also maintained contact with Trotsky&#x27;s widow, Natalia Sedova, who generally agreed with his views at that time.

During the 1950s, Shachtman&#x27;s supporters in the UAW abandoned their opposition to President Walter Reuther and increasingly took staff positions at UAW headquarters. As early as 1949 they supported the purge of CP-linked unions from the CIO. Internationally they gave up their identification with the Fourth International after a failed attempt in 1947–48 to reunify with the SWP, and aligned with the left wings of the British Labour Party, other European social democratic parties, and nationalist forces like the Indian National Congress party in colonial and ex-colonial countries. Shachtman and the ISL moved from Leninism to an avowedly Marxist version of democratic socialism. In the same period Shachtman left his second wife and New York City, moving with his third wife, Yetta, to the Long Island suburb of Floral Park.

In 1962, Shachtman published &quot;The Bureaucratic Revolution: The Rise of the Stalinist State&quot;. This collected and codified Shachtman&#x27;s key thoughts on Stalinism, and reworked some of his previous conclusions. On the first page of the book&#x27;s foreword, Shachtman claimed that &quot;Stalinist Russia and all countries of the same structure represent a new social order. I call it bureaucratic collectivism. The name is meant to reject the belief that Stalinist society is in any way socialist or compatible with socialism.&quot; 

===Shachtman in the Socialist Party===
In 1958, the ISL dissolved so that its members could join the Socialist Party, which from its height in the 1910s had fallen in strength to approximately 1,000 members. Shachtman helped pressure the SP to work with the Democratic Party in order to push the Democrats to the left. This strategy was known as &quot;realignment&quot;. With the eager participation of the Shachtmanites, the SP took an active role in the early events of the New Left and the Civil Rights Movement. Shachtman developed close and enduring ties to African-American pacifist and civil rights leader Bayard Rustin, and thought up the name for the 1966 Freedom Budget that Rustin developed as director of the A. Philip Randolph Institute. By contrast, Shachtman&#x27;s initial ties to the young leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee frayed after the 1964 Democratic Convention, when he and his allies backed the Johnson Administration&#x27;s decision to seat only two delegates from the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.

During this time, Shachtman started the research for a major book on the Communist International. Although the book was never completed, his views were collected in a working paper prepared for a 1964 conference of the Hoover Institute at Stanford University. Shachtman&#x27;s research notes for the book are held at the Tamiment Library.

In 1961 Hal Draper criticized Shachtman&#x27;s refusal to condemn the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and in 1964 Draper helped to form the Independent Socialist Club. Shachtman favored a negotiated peace settlement rather than a unilateral US withdrawal from the Vietnam War.

===Death and legacy===
Max Shachtman died in Floral Park on November 4, 1972, from coronary failure. He was 68 years old at the time of his death.

Individuals influenced by Shachtman&#x27;s organisations have shared his opposition to Stalinism. A number of political organizations have emerged from the Trotskyist movement which have considered themselves to be Marxist. This broad tendency is described as &quot;Left Shachtmanism,&quot; but does not include followers of Tony Cliff, such as the International Socialist Tendency, as Cliff himself was greatly critical of Shachtman&#x27;s entire political life and theoretical work.

Glotzer argues that Shachtman&#x27;s theory of bureaucratic collectivism has also informed unorthodox approaches within Marxism towards the class nature of the Eastern Bloc.

==Yetta Barsh Shachtman==
Yetta Barsh Shachtman (1915–1996) was married to Max Shachtman and also held Marxist views. Barsh attended Tuley High School in Chicago, where she and her future husband Nathan Gould were chosen to give the commencement address for the class of 1932. They delivered &quot;a fiery attack on the capitalist system replete with quotes from Big Bill Haywood and Eugene Debs&quot;.

Barsh was first married to Nathan &quot;Natie&quot; Gould, her high school boyfriend, who was also a Trotskyist activist. Her friends in high school also included the future novelist Isaac Rosenfeld, who shared her interest in radical politics. After obtaining a divorce from Gould, she married Shachtman in 1954.

Barsh worked as the secretary of Albert Shanker, the president of the United Federation of Teachers. The money she earned from this job allowed Shachtman to focus on his political work. While working for Shanker, Barsh was responsible for the hiring of Sandra Feldman and Eugenia Kemble.

She appears in the letters of classmate Saul Bellow who also attended Tuley High School. She graduated in 1932. Bellow delivered a eulogy at her funeral, crediting her with introducing him to politics and Marxism, and describing her as &quot;one of those persons who draw you into their lives and also install themselves in yours&quot;.

<doc id="324498" wikidata="Q189566" url="?curid=324498" title="Mortar (masonry)">
<text>Mortar is a workable paste which hardens to bind building blocks such as stones, bricks, and concrete masonry units, to fill and seal the irregular gaps between them, spread the weight of them evenly, and sometimes to add decorative colours or patterns to masonry walls. In its broadest sense, mortar includes pitch, asphalt, and soft clay, as those used between bricks, as well as cement mortar. The word &quot;mortar&quot; comes from the Old French word &quot;mortier&quot;, &quot;builder&#x27;s mortar, plaster; bowl for mixing.&quot; (13c.). 

Cement mortar becomes hard when it cures, resulting in a rigid aggregate structure; however, the mortar functions as a weaker component than the building blocks and serves as the sacrificial element in the masonry, because mortar is easier and less expensive to repair than the building blocks. Bricklayers typically make mortars using a mixture of sand, a binder, and water. The most common binder since the early 20th century is Portland cement, but the ancient binder lime (producing lime mortar) is still used in some specialty new construction. Lime, lime mortar, and gypsum in the form of plaster of Paris are used particularly in the repair and repointing of historic buildings and structures, so that the repair materials will be similar in performance and appearance to the original materials. Several types of cement mortars and additives exist.

==Ancient mortar==

The first mortars were made of mud and clay, as demonstrated in the 10th millennium BC buildings of Jericho, and the 8th millennium BC of Ganj Dareh.

According to Roman Ghirshman, the first evidence of humans using a form of mortar was at the Mehrgarh of Baluchistan in what is today Pakistan, built of sun-dried bricks in 6500 BC. 

Gypsum mortar, also called plaster of Paris, was used in the construction of many ancient structures. It is made from gypsum, which requires a lower firing temperature. It is therefore easier to make than lime mortar and sets up much faster, which may be a reason it was used as the typical mortar in ancient, brick arch and vault construction. Gypsum mortar is not as durable as other mortars in damp conditions.

In the Indian subcontinent, multiple cement types have been observed in the sites of the Indus Valley civilization, with gypsum appearing at sites such as the Mohenjo-daro city-settlement, which dates to earlier than 2600 BC. 

Gypsum cement that was &quot;&quot;light grey and contained sand, clay, traces of calcium carbonate, and a high percentage of lime&quot; was used in the construction of wells, drains, and on the exteriors of &quot;important looking buildings&quot;.&quot; Bitumen mortar was also used at a lower-frequency, including in the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro.

In early Egyptian pyramids, which were constructed during the Old Kingdom (~2600–2500 BC), the limestone blocks were bound by a mortar of mud and clay, or clay and sand. In later Egyptian pyramids, the mortar was made of gypsum, or lime. Gypsum mortar was essentially a mixture of plaster and sand and was quite soft.

2nd millennium Babylonian constructions used lime or pitch for mortar. 

Historically, building with concrete and mortar next appeared in Greece. The excavation of the underground aqueduct of Megara revealed that a reservoir was coated with a pozzolanic mortar 12 mm thick. This aqueduct dates back to c. 500 BC. Pozzolanic mortar is a lime based mortar, but is made with an additive of volcanic ash that allows it to be hardened underwater; thus it is known as hydraulic cement. The Greeks obtained the volcanic ash from the Greek islands Thira and Nisiros, or from the then Greek colony of Dicaearchia (Pozzuoli) near Naples, Italy. The Romans later improved the use and methods of making what became known as pozzolanic mortar and cement. Even later, the Romans used a mortar without pozzolana using crushed terra cotta, introducing aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide into the mix. This mortar was not as strong as pozzolanic mortar, but, because it was denser, it better resisted penetration by water.

Hydraulic mortar was not available in ancient China, possibly due to a lack of volcanic ash. Around 500 CE, sticky rice soup was mixed with slaked lime to make an inorganic−organic composite sticky rice mortar that had more strength and water resistance than lime mortar.

It is not understood how the art of making hydraulic mortar and cement, which was perfected and in such widespread use by both the Greeks and Romans, was then lost for almost two millennia. During the Middle Ages when the Gothic cathedrals were being built, the only active ingredient in the mortar was lime. Since cured lime mortar can be degraded by contact with water, many structures suffered over the centuries from wind-blown rain.

==Ordinary Portland cement mortar==
&quot;Ordinary Portland cement mortar&quot;, commonly known as OPC mortar or just cement mortar, is created by mixing powdered ordinary Portland cement, fine aggregate and water.

It was invented in 1794 by Joseph Aspdin and patented on 18 December 1824, largely as a result of efforts to develop stronger mortars. It was made popular during the late nineteenth century, and had by 1930 became more popular than lime mortar as construction material. The advantages of Portland cement is that it sets hard and quickly, allowing a faster pace of construction. Furthermore, fewer skilled workers are required in building a structure with Portland cement.

As a general rule, however, Portland cement should not be used for the repair or repointing of older buildings built in lime mortar, which require the flexibility, softness and breathability of lime if they are to function correctly.

In the United States and other countries, five standard types of mortar (available as dry pre-mixed products) are generally used for both new construction and repair. Strengths of mortar change based on the mix ratio for each type of mortar, which are specified under the ASTM standards.
These premixed mortar products are designated by one of the five letters, M, S, N, O, and K. Type M mortar is the strongest, and Type K the weakest. 
The mix ratio is always expressed by volume of formula_1.

These type letters are taken from the alternate letters of the words &quot;MaSoN wOrK&quot;.
==Polymer cement mortar==
Polymer cement mortars (PCM) are the materials which are made by partially replacing the cement hydrate binders of conventional cement mortar with polymers. The polymeric admixtures include latexes or emulsions, redispersible polymer powders, water-soluble polymers, liquid thermoset resins and monomers. Although they increase cost of mortars when used as an additive, they enhance properties. Polymer mortar has low permeability that may be detrimental to moisture accumulation when used to repair a traditional brick, block or stone wall. It is mainly designed for repairing concrete structures. The use of recovered plastics in mortars is being researched and is gaining ground. Depolymerizing PET to use as a polymeric binder to enhance mortars is actively being studied.

The setting speed can be increased by using impure limestone in the kiln, to form a hydraulic lime that will set on contact with water. Such a lime must be stored as a dry powder. Alternatively, a pozzolanic material such as calcined clay or brick dust may be added to the mortar mix. Addition of a pozzolanic material will make the mortar set reasonably quickly by reaction with the water.

It would be problematic to use Portland cement mortars to repair older buildings originally constructed using lime mortar. Lime mortar is softer than cement mortar, allowing brickwork a certain degree of flexibility to adapt to shifting ground or other changing conditions. Cement mortar is harder and allows little flexibility. The contrast can cause brickwork to crack where the two mortars are present in a single wall.

Lime mortar is considered breathable in that it will allow moisture to freely move through and evaporate from the surface. In old buildings with walls that shift over time, cracks can be found which allow rain water into the structure. The lime mortar allows this moisture to escape through evaporation and keeps the wall dry. Re−pointing or rendering an old wall with cement mortar stops the evaporation and can cause problems associated with moisture behind the cement.

==Pozzolanic mortar==

Pozzolana is a fine, sandy volcanic ash. It was originally discovered and dug at Pozzuoli, nearby Mount Vesuvius in Italy, and was subsequently mined at other sites, too. The Romans learned that pozzolana added to lime mortar allowed the lime to set relatively quickly and even under water. Vitruvius, the Roman architect, spoke of four types of pozzolana. It is found in all the volcanic areas of Italy in various colours: black, white, grey and red. Pozzolana has since become a generic term for any siliceous and/or aluminous additive to slaked lime to create hydraulic cement.

Finely ground and mixed with lime it is a hydraulic cement, like Portland cement, and makes a strong mortar that will also set under water.

The fact that the materials involved in the creation of pozzolana are found in abundance within certain territories make its use more common there, with areas inside of Central Europe as well as inside of Southern Europe being an example (significantly because of the many European volcanoes of note). It has, as such, been commonly associated with a variety of large structures constructed by the Roman Empire.

==Radiocarbon dating==
As the mortar hardens, the current atmosphere is encased in the mortar and thus provides a sample for analysis. Various factors affect the sample and raise the margin of error for the analysis.
Radiocarbon dating of mortar began as early as the 1960s, soon after the method was established (Delibrias and Labeyrie 1964; Stuiver and Smith 1965; Folk and Valastro 1976). The very first data were provided by van Strydonck et al. (1983), Heinemeier et al.(1997) and Ringbom and Remmer (1995). Methodological aspects were further developed by different groups (an international team headed by Åbo Akademi University, and teams from CIRCE, CIRCe, ETHZ, Poznań, RICH and Milano-Bicocca laboratory. 
To evaluate the different anthropogenic carbon extraction methods for radiocarbon dating as well as to compare the different dating methods, i.e. radiocarbon and OSL, the first intercomparison study (MODIS) was set up and published in 2017.
