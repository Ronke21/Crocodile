<doc id="330508" wikidata="Q148610" url="?curid=330508" title="Tupi–Guarani languages">
<text>Tupi–Guarani (/tuːˈpiː ɡwɑˈrɑːni/ /ɡwɑˈɾɑ-/; Tupi-Guarani: [tuˈpi ɡwaɾaˈni];) is the most widely distributed subfamily of the Tupian languages of South America. It consists of about fifty languages, including Guarani and Old Tupi. The most widely spoken in modern times by far is Guarani, which is one of the two official languages of Paraguay.

The words &quot;petunia, jaguar, piranha, ipecac, tapioca, jacaranda, anhinga, carioca&quot;, and &quot;capoeira&quot; are of Tupi–Guarani origin.

==Classification==
===Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2012)===
Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2012) propose eight branches of Tupí–Guaraní:
* Tupí–Guaraní
** Guaraní (Group I)
** Guarayu (Group II): Guarayu, Pauserna**, Sirionó (dialects: Yuqui, Jorá**)
** Tupí (Group III): Old Tupi (lingua franca dialect: Tupí Austral), Tupinambá (dialects: Nheengatu, Língua Geral as lingua franca, and Potiguára), Cocama–Omagua*, Tupinikin**
** Tenetehara (Group IV): Akwáwa (dialects: Asuriní, Suruí do Pará, Parakanã), Avá-Canoeiro, Tapirapé, Tenetehára (dialects: Guajajara, Tembé), Turiwára
** Kawahíb (Group VI): Apiacá, Kawahíb (numerous varieties; incl. Piripkúra, Diahói?), Kayabí, Karipúna, ?Uru-Pa-In
** Kamayurá (Group VII)
** Xingu (Group VIIIa): Anambé (of Cairarí), Amanayé, Xingú Asuriní, Araweté, Aurá, Ararandewara
** Northern Tupi–Guaraní (Group VIIIb): Anambé of Ehrenreich, Emerillon, Guajá, Wayampi, Zo&#x27;é, Takunyapé, Urubú–Kaapor, Wayampipukú
*Cabral argues that Kokama/Omagua is a mixed language, and so not directly classifiable, though most of its basic vocabulary is Tupi–Guarani.

**Not listed in Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2012)

Karipuna language (Amapá) may be spurious.

Sound changes from Proto-Tupi-Guarani (PTG) defining each of the 8 Tupi-Guarani groups as listed by Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2002):

===Michael, et al. (2015)===
Michael, et al. (2015) propose the following classification for the Tupi–Guarani languages.
* Tupí-Guaraní
** Kamaiurá (600 speakers)
** Nuclear Tupí-Guaraní
*** Northern
**** Guajá (280 speakers)
**** Ka&#x27;ápor (800 speakers)
**** Avá-Canoeiro (14 speakers)
*** Central
***** Anambé, Araweté (Anambé 6 speakers, Araweté 280 speakers)
***** Xingú Asurini (120 speakers)
***** Tocantins Asuriní, Parakanã (700-1,500 speakers)
***** Tapirapé (560 speakers)
*** Peripheral
**** Wayampi, Emerillon (Wayampi 1,200 speakers, Emerillon 400 speakers)
**** Kayabí, Parintintin (Kayabí 1,000 speakers, Kagwahiva 870 speakers)
**** Diasporic
***** Tembé (13,000 speakers)
****** Tupi
******* Omagua, Kokama (Omagua 10 speakers, Cocama 250 speakers)
******* Tupinambá (Nheengatu 19,000 speakers)
****** Southern
******* Sirionó, Yuki (500 speakers)
******* Guarayu, Pauserna (Guarayu 5,900 speakers)
******* Guaranian
******** Aché (910 speakers)
******** Mbyá
******** Paraguay Guaraní (4.85 million speakers)
********* Xetá , Kaiowá, Ñandeva (Kaiwá 18,000 speakers, Ava Guarani 16,000 speakers)
********* Tapiete, Chiriguano (Chiriguano 51,000 speakers)
O&#x27;Hagan et al. (2014, 2019) proposes that Proto-Tupi-Guarani was spoken in the region of the lower Tocantins and Xingu Rivers, just to the south of Marajó Island in eastern Pará State, Brazil. Proto-Omagua-Kokama then expanded up the Amazon River, Proto-Tupinambá expanded south along the Atlantic coast, and the Southern branch expanded up along the Tocantins/Araguaia River towards the Paraná River basin.

<doc id="330509" wikidata="Q3797509" url="?curid=330509" title="Ina Coolbrith">
<text>Ina Donna Coolbrith (born Josephine Donna Smith; March 10, 1841 – February 29, 1928) was an American poet, writer, librarian, and a prominent figure in the San Francisco Bay Area literary community. Called the &quot;Sweet Singer of California&quot;, she was the first California Poet Laureate and the first poet laureate of any American state. 

Coolbrith, born the niece of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints founder Joseph Smith, left the Mormon community as a child to enter her teens in Los Angeles, California, where she began to publish poetry. She terminated a youthful failed marriage to make her home in San Francisco, and met writers Bret Harte and Charles Warren Stoddard with whom she formed the &quot;Golden Gate Trinity&quot; closely associated with the literary journal &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;. Her poetry received positive notice from critics and established poets such as Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce and Alfred Lord Tennyson. She held literary salons at her home in Russian Hill—in this way she introduced new writers to publishers. Coolbrith befriended the poet Joaquin Miller and helped him gain global fame. 

While Miller toured Europe and lived out their mutual dream of visiting Lord Byron&#x27;s tomb, Coolbrith cared for his Wintu daughter and members of her own family. As a result, she came to reside in Oakland and accepted the position of city librarian. Her poetry suffered as a result of her long work hours, but she mentored a generation of young readers including Jack London and Isadora Duncan. After she served for 19 years, Oakland&#x27;s library patrons called for reorganization, and Coolbrith was fired. She moved back to San Francisco and was invited by members of the Bohemian Club to be their librarian.

Coolbrith began to write a history of California literature, including much autobiographical material, but the fire following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake consumed her work. Author Gertrude Atherton and Coolbrith&#x27;s Bohemian Club friends helped set her up again in a new house, and she resumed writing and holding literary salons. She traveled by train to New York City several times and, with fewer worldly cares, greatly increased her poetry output. 

On June 30, 1915, Coolbrith was named California&#x27;s poet laureate, and she continued to write poetry for eight more years. Her style was more than the usual melancholic or uplifting themes expected of women—she included a wide variety of subjects in her poems, which were noted as being &quot;singularly sympathetic&quot; and &quot;palpably spontaneous&quot;. Her sensuous descriptions of natural scenes advanced the art of Victorian poetry to incorporate greater accuracy without trite sentiment, foreshadowing the Imagist school and the work of Robert Frost. California poet laureate Carol Muske-Dukes wrote of Coolbrith&#x27;s poems that, though they &quot;were steeped in a high tea lavender style&quot;, influenced by a British stateliness, &quot;California remained her inspiration.&quot;

==Early life==

Ina Coolbrith was born Josephine Donna Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois, the last of three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith, brother to Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. Coolbrith&#x27;s father died of malarial fever four months after her birth, and a sister died one month after that; Coolbrith&#x27;s mother then married Joseph Smith, in 1842, becoming his sixth or seventh wife. No children came of the union—Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of Smith. In June 1844, Smith was killed at the hands of an anti-Mormon mob. 

Losing her faith and fearful of her life, Coolbrith&#x27;s mother left the Latter-day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis, Missouri, where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett. Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train. On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare&#x27;s works and from a collection of Byron&#x27;s poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front of the wagon train with the famous African-American scout James Beckwourth, riding with him on his horse, through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass. The family settled in Los Angeles, California, and Pickett established a law practice.

To avoid identification with her former family or with Mormonism, Ina&#x27;s mother reverted to using her maiden name, Coolbrith. The family resolved not to speak of their Mormon past, and it was only after Ina Coolbrith&#x27;s death that the general public learned of her origin. Coolbrith did keep in touch with her Smith relations, however, including a lifelong correspondence with her first cousin Joseph F. Smith to whom and for whom she frequently expressed her love and regard.

Coolbrith, sometimes called &quot;Josephina&quot; or just &quot;Ina&quot;, wrote poems beginning at age 11, first publishing &quot;My Ideal Home&quot; in a newspaper in 1856, writing as Ina Donna Coolbrith. Her work appeared in the Poetry Corner of the &quot;Los Angeles Star&quot;, and in the &quot;California Home Journal&quot;. As she grew into young womanhood, Coolbrith was renowned for her beauty; she was selected to open a ball with Pío Pico, the last Mexican governor of California. 

In April 1858, at the age of 17, Coolbrith married Robert Bruce Carsley, an iron worker and part-time actor. However, she experienced abuse at his hands, and suffered further emotional pain from the death of the couple&#x27;s infant son. An altercation between Pickett and Carsley resulted in a bullet mutilating Carsley&#x27;s hand, requiring amputation. Carsley accused Coolbrith of infidelity, and she divorced him in a sensational public trial; the dissolution was finalized on December 30, 1861. Her later poem, &quot;The Mother&#x27;s Grief&quot;, was a eulogy to her lost son, but she never publicly explained its meaning; it was only upon Coolbrith&#x27;s death that her literary friends discovered that she had ever been a mother. 

In 1862, Coolbrith moved with her mother, stepfather and twin half-brothers to San Francisco to ward off depression. She also changed her name from Josephine Donna Carsley to Ina Coolbrith. In San Francisco she found employment as an English teacher.

==Poet==

Coolbrith soon met Bret Harte and Samuel Langhorne Clemens, writing as Mark Twain, in San Francisco. She published poems in &quot;The Californian&quot;, a new literary newspaper formed in 1864 and edited by Harte and Charles Henry Webb. In 1867, four of Coolbrith&#x27;s poems appeared in &quot;The Galaxy&quot;. In July 1868, Coolbrith supplied a poem, &quot;Longing&quot;, for the first issue of the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;, and served unofficially as co-editor with Harte in selecting poems, articles and stories for the periodical. She became a friend of actress and poet Adah Menken, adding to Menken&#x27;s credibility as an intellectual, but was unable to impress Harte of Menken&#x27;s worth. Coolbrith also worked as a schoolteacher for extra income. 

For a decade, Coolbrith supplied one poem for each new issue of the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;. After the 1866 publication of four of her poems in an anthology edited by Harte, Coolbrith&#x27;s &quot;The Mother&#x27;s Grief&quot; was positively reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Another poem, &quot;When the Grass Shall Cover Me&quot;, appeared unattributed in an anthology of John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s favorite works by other poets, entitled &quot;Songs of Three Centuries&quot; (1875); Coolbrith&#x27;s poem was judged the best of that group. In 1867, recently widowed Josephine Clifford arrived at the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; to take a position as secretary. She formed a lifetime friendship with Coolbrith.

Coolbrith&#x27;s literary work connected her with poet Alfred Lord Tennyson and naturalist John Muir, as well as Charles Warren Stoddard who also helped Harte edit the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;. As editors and arbiters of literary taste, Harte, Stoddard and Coolbrith were known as the &quot;Golden Gate Trinity&quot;. Stoddard once said that Coolbrith never had any of her literary submissions returned from a publisher. Coolbrith met writer and critic Ambrose Bierce in 1869, and by 1871 when he was courting Mary Ellen Day, Bierce organized friendly card games between himself, Day, Coolbrith and Stoddard. Bierce felt that Coolbrith&#x27;s best poems were &quot;California&quot;, the commencement ode she wrote for the University of California in 1871, and &quot;Beside the Dead&quot;, written in 1875.
In mid-1870, Coolbrith met the eccentric poet Cincinnatus Hiner Miller, newly divorced from his second wife, and introduced him to the San Francisco literary circle at the suggestion of Stoddard. Miller quoted Tennyson in describing Coolbrith as &quot;divinely tall, and most divinely fair&quot;. When Coolbrith discovered that Miller was enamored of the heroic, tragic life of the legendary &quot;Californio&quot; outlaw Joaquin Murrieta, she suggested that Miller take the name Joaquin Miller as his pen name, and also that he dress the part with longer hair and a more recognizably mountain man-style costume. 

Coolbrith then helped Miller prepare for his upcoming trip to England, where he would lay a laurel wreath on the tomb of Lord Byron, a poet they both greatly admired. The two gathered California Bay Laurel branches in Sausalito and took portrait photographs together. Coolbrith wrote &quot;With a Wreath of Laurel&quot; about this enterprise. Miller went to New York by train, calling himself &quot;Joaquin Miller&quot; for the first time, and was in London by August 1870. When he placed the wreath at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall, it caused a stir among the English clergy who did not see any connection between California poets and the late lord. They sent to Constantine I, the King of Greece for another laurel wreath from that country of Byron&#x27;s heroic death, accompanied by some Greek funding which was joined in kind from the purse of the Bishop of Norwich to rebuild and refurbish the 500-year-old church. The two wreaths were hung side by side over Byron&#x27;s tomb. After this, Miller was nicknamed &quot;The Byron of the West.&quot;

==Librarian==
Coolbrith had hoped to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller, but stayed behind in San Francisco because she felt obliged to care for her mother and her seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable to care for herself or for her two children. In late 1871 she took on the care of another dependent when Joaquin Miller brought her a teenaged Indian girl (widely rumored to be his own daughter) to care for while he went abroad again, this time to Brazil and Europe.

At a literary dinner on May 5, 1874, Coolbrith was elected an honorary member of the Bohemian Club, the second of four women so honored. This allowed the members of the club to discreetly assist her in her finances, but their help was not enough to cover her full burden. Coolbrith moved to Oakland to set up a larger household for her extended family. Coolbrith&#x27;s sister Agnes died late in 1874, and the orphaned niece and nephew continued to live with Coolbrith. Coolbrith wrote &quot;Beside the Dead&quot; in grief from the loss of her sister. Her mother Agnes died in 1876.

To support the household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a position as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association, a subscription library that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less than a man would have received. She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry suffered as a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland&#x27;s librarian was the low point of her poetic career.
At the library, her style was personal: she discussed with the patrons their interests, and she selected books she felt were appropriate. In 1886, she befriended and mentored the 10-year-old Jack London, guiding his reading. London called her his &quot;literary mother&quot;. Twenty years later, London wrote to Coolbrith to thank her.

Coolbrith also mentored young Isadora Duncan, who later described Coolbrith as &quot;a very wonderful&quot; woman, with &quot;very beautiful eyes that glowed with burning fire and passion&quot;. Magazine writer Samuel Dickson reported that, at a soirée in 1927, an aging Coolbrith told him of the famous lovers she had known, and that she had once dazzled Joseph Duncan, Isadora&#x27;s father. Coolbrith said that his attentions led to the breakup of his marriage. Duncan&#x27;s mother left San Francisco and settled her four children in Oakland, little knowing that Coolbrith would soon meet one of her children, and help the young dancer develop a wider knowledge of the world through reading. Duncan wrote in her autobiography that, as a librarian, Coolbrith was always pleased with the youthful dancer&#x27;s book choices, and that Duncan did not find out until later that Coolbrith was &quot;evidently the great passion of [Joseph Duncan&#x27;s] life&quot;.

Coolbrith&#x27;s nephew Henry Frank Peterson came to work with her at the library, and began to organize the books into a faceted classification scheme that she specified, one which used one- and two-digit numbers to stand for general subjects, and three-digit numbers to indicate individual books in that subject. Before this, Coolbrith had resisted library trustee attempts to classify the books; she had wished to continue the reading-room atmosphere that she had established.

In 1881, Coolbrith&#x27;s poetry was published in book form, entitled &quot;A Perfect Day, and Other Poems&quot;. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, after Coolbrith&#x27;s publisher sent him a copy, said &quot;I know that California has at least one poet.&quot; Of the poems, he said &quot;I have been reading them with delight.&quot; Yale poet Edward Rowland Sill, professor at the University of California and a keen critic of American literature, gave Coolbrith a letter of introduction that he wished her to send to publisher Henry Holt. It said, simply, &quot;Miss Ina Coolbrith, one of our few really literary persons in California, and the writer of many lovely poems; in fact, the most genuine singer the West has yet produced.&quot; Quaker poet and former abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier wrote to Coolbrith from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to share his opinion that her &quot;little volume&quot; of poetry, &quot;which has found such favor with all who have seen it on this side of the Rocky mountains&quot;, should be republished on the East Coast. He told her &quot;there is no verse on the Pacific Slope which has the fine quality of thine.&quot;

Beginning as early as 1865 in San Francisco, Coolbrith held literary meetings at her home, hosting readings of poetry, and topical discussions, in the tradition of European salons. She helped writers such as Gelett Burgess and Laura Redden Searing gain wider notice.
Once warmly social with her, in the 1880s Ambrose Bierce turned his caustic pen to criticism of Coolbrith&#x27;s work, and thus lost her as a friend. In 1883, he wrote that her finely-wrought poem &quot;Our Poets&quot; should have been made a dirge, as the great poets of California were dead. He wrote that the periodical she worked for should be named the &quot;Warmed-Overland Monthly&quot; because it delivered nothing new. Regarding her poem &quot;Unattained&quot;, Bierce complained of &quot;this dainty writer&#x27;s tiresome .&quot; In response, Coolbrith sided with those who said his incessant needling led local writer David Lesser Lezinsky to suicide.
Coolbrith published poems in &quot;The Century&quot; in 1883, 1885, 1886 and 1894. All four poems were included in Coolbrith&#x27;s 1895 book, &quot;Songs from the Golden Gate&quot;—a re-issue of her earlier 1881 collection, with some 40 poems added. In New York, Coolbrith was acknowledged by a reviewer in the monthly journal &quot;Current Opinion&quot; as &quot;a true, melodious and natural singer. Her work is characterized by great delicacy and refinement of feeling, and comprises dainty love songs, verses of deep religious feeling, stately odes, written for special occasions, and charming bits of description.&quot;

In September 1892, Coolbrith was given three days&#x27; notice to clear her desk, to be replaced as librarian by her nephew Henry Frank Peterson. A library trustee was quoted as saying &quot;we need a librarian not a poet.&quot; Coolbrith&#x27;s literary friends were outraged, and published a lengthy opinion piece to that effect in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. Peterson&#x27;s plans for the library were quite successful, however; under his guidance circulation quickly grew from 3,000 to 13,000. Peterson opened the library on Sundays and holidays and increased accessibility to the stacks—he was praised by trustees for his &quot;management improvements&quot;.

In 1893 at the World&#x27;s Congress of Representative Women, held at the beginning of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Coolbrith was described by Ella Sterling Cummins (later Mighels) as &quot;the best known of California writers... who stands peerless at the head.&quot; Coolbrith was commissioned to write a poem for the Exposition, and in October 1893 she brought with her to Chicago the poem &quot;Isabella of Spain&quot; to help dedicate Harriet Hosmer&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Queen Isabella&quot; which stood before the Pampas Plume Palace within the California Pavilion. Listening to Coolbrith were well-known women such as suffragist Susan B. Anthony and journalist Lilian Whiting. During Coolbrith&#x27;s visit, Charlotte Perkins Stetson, her friend from the Pacific Coast Woman&#x27;s Press Association (the two women served as president and vice-president, respectively), wrote to May Wright Sewall on her behalf; Stetson observed that Coolbrith could benefit from introductions to Chicago&#x27;s best writers.

Coolbrith&#x27;s difficulties in Oakland, followed by her trip to Chicago, unsettled her friends, who did not wish to see her move away and &quot;become an alien&quot; to California. John Muir had long been in the habit of sending Coolbrith letters, as well as the occasional box of fruit (such as cherries picked from the trees on his Martinez estate). He made such an offering in late 1894, accompanied by a suggestion for a new career which he thought would keep her in the area: she could fill the position of San Francisco&#x27;s librarian, recently vacated by John Vance Cheney. Coolbrith sent a response to Muir, thanking him for &quot;the fruit of your land, and the fruit of your brain&quot;. After signing the letter &quot;your old-time friend&quot;, she added a post-script comment: &quot;No, I cannot have Mr. Cheney&#x27;s place. I am &quot;disqualified by sex&quot;.&quot; At that time, San Francisco required that their librarian be a man.

In 1894, Coolbrith honored poet Celia Thaxter with a memorial poem entitled &quot;The Singer of the Sea&quot;. Thaxter had been to the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; what Coolbrith was to the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;: its &quot;lady poet&quot; who submitted verse containing &quot;local color&quot;.
A second poetry collection, &quot;Songs from the Golden Gate&quot;, was published in 1895. It contained &quot;The Mariposa Lily&quot;, a description of California&#x27;s natural beauty, and &quot;The Captive of the White City&quot;, which detailed the cruel mistreatment of Native Americans in the late 19th century. In addition, the collection included &quot;The Sea-Shell&quot; and &quot;Sailed&quot;, two poems in which Coolbrith described a woman&#x27;s love with deep sympathy and unusually vivid physical imagery, in a way that presaged the later Imagist school of Ezra Pound and Robert Frost. The book included four monochrome reproductions of paintings by William Keith that he had devised as visual representations of the poetry. It was well received in London, where editor Albert Kinross of &quot;The Outlook&quot; papered the walls of the London Underground with posters announcing &quot;his great discovery&quot;.

Connections among Coolbrith&#x27;s circle of friends resulted in a librarian job at San Francisco&#x27;s Mercantile Library Association in 1898, and she moved back to Russian Hill in San Francisco. In January 1899, artist William Keith and poet Charles Keeler obtained for her a part-time position as librarian of the Bohemian Club, of which Keith and Keeler were members. Her first assignment was to edit &quot;Songs from Bohemia&quot;, a book of poems by Daniel O&#x27;Connell, Bohemian Club co-founder and journalist, following his death. Her salary was $50 each month, less than she had been earning in Oakland, but her duties were light enough that she was able to devote a greater proportion of her time to writing, and she signed on as sometime staff of Charles Fletcher Lummis&#x27;s &quot;The Land of Sunshine&quot; magazine. As a personal project, she began to work on a history of California literature.

==Earthquake and fire==

By February 1906, Coolbrith&#x27;s health was showing signs of deterioration. She was often sick in bed with rheumatism, and hard-pressed to continue her work at the Bohemian Club. Still, in March 1906 she gave a lengthy reading to the Pacific Coast Woman&#x27;s Press Association entitled &quot;Some Women Poets of America.&quot; Coolbrith, third vice president and life member of the club, briefly discussed the most prominent early American women poets but focused more fully on ones that became known in the second half of the 19th century, reciting example verse, and critically evaluating the work. 

A month later, disaster struck in the form of the calamitous fire that followed the great San Francisco earthquake in April 1906: Coolbrith&#x27;s home at 1604 Taylor Street burned to the ground. Directly after the earthquake but before fire threatened, Coolbrith had left her house carrying a pet cat, thinking she would soon return. Her student boarder Robert Norman and her companion Josephine Zeller were unable to carry more than another cat, a few small bundles of letters and Coolbrith&#x27;s scrapbook. Immediately after he spotted heavy smoke from across the bay, Joaquin Miller took the ferry from Oakland to San Francisco in order to assist Coolbrith in saving her valuables from the approaching fire, but was prevented from doing so by soldiers who had orders to use deadly force against looters. In the blaze, Coolbrith lost 3,000 books including priceless signed first editions, artwork by Keith, many personal letters from famous people such as Whittier, Clemens, George Meredith and, worst of all, her nearly complete manuscript that was part autobiography and part history of California&#x27;s early literary scene.
Coolbrith never resumed the work of writing the history, as she was unable to balance its revelatory autobiographical truth with the scandal that would then ensue. In her life, there were rumors that she had accepted men such as Harte, Stoddard, Clemens and Miller as occasional lovers—a book discussing these liaisons was one she considered too controversial.

Coolbrith spent a few years in temporary residences while friends rallied to raise money to build a house for her. From New York, Coolbrith&#x27;s old associate Mark Twain sent three autographed photographs of himself that sold for $10 apiece—he was subsequently convinced to sit for 17 more studio photographs to add further to the fund. In February 1907, the San Jose Women&#x27;s Club hosted an event called &quot;Ina Coolbrith Day&quot; to promote interest in legislating a state pension for Coolbrith, and in a book project being put forward by the Spinners&#x27; Club. In June 1907, the Spinners&#x27; Club printed a book entitled &quot;The Spinners&#x27; book of fiction&quot; whose proceeds were to be given to Coolbrith. Frank Norris, Mary Hallock Foote and Mary Hunter Austin were among the authors who contributed stories. The poet George Sterling, a friend from the Bohemian Club, submitted an introductory poem, and Bohemian Maynard Dixon was among the illustrators. The driving force behind the effort was Gertrude Atherton, a writer who saw in Coolbrith a connection to California&#x27;s literary origins. When the book failed to produce sufficient funding, Atherton added enough from her own pocket to start construction. 

A new house was built for Coolbrith at 1067 Broadway on Russian Hill. Settled there, she resumed hosting salons. In 1910, she received a trust fund from Atherton. During 1910–1914, with money from Atherton and a discreet grant from her Bohemian friends, Coolbrith spent time going between residences in New York City and San Francisco, writing poetry. In four winters, she wrote more poetry than in the preceding 25 years.

==Poet laureate==

In 1911, Coolbrith accepted the presidency of the Pacific Coast Woman&#x27;s Press Association, and a park was dedicated to her, at 1715 Taylor Street, one block from her pre-earthquake home. Coolbrith was named honorary member of the California Writers Club around 1913, a group that eventually grew into a state-wide organization. In 1913, Ella Sterling Mighels founded the California Literature Society which met informally once a month at Coolbrith&#x27;s Russian Hill home, newspaper columnist and literary critic George Hamlin Fitch presiding. Mighels, who has been called California&#x27;s literary historian, credited her breadth of knowledge to Coolbrith and the society meetings.

In preparation for the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, Coolbrith was named President of the Congress of Authors and Journalists. In this position she sent more than 4,000 letters to the world&#x27;s most well-known writers and journalists. At the Exposition itself on June 30, Coolbrith was lauded by Senator James D. Phelan who said that her early associate Bret Harte called her the &quot;sweetest note in California literature.&quot; Phelan continued, &quot;she has written little, but that little is great. It is of the purest quality, finished and perfect, as well as full of feeling and thought.&quot; The &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; reported that &quot;eyes were wet throughout the large audience&quot; when Coolbrith was crowned with a laurel wreath by Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California, who called her the &quot;loved, laurel-crowned poet of California.&quot; After several more speeches were made in her honor, and bouquets brought in abundance to the podium, Coolbrith, wearing a black robe with a sash bearing a garland of bright orange California poppies, addressed the crowd, saying, &quot;There is one woman here with whom I want to share these honors: Josephine Clifford McCracken. For we are linked together, the last two living members of Bret Harte&#x27;s staff of &quot;Overland&quot; writers.&quot; McCracken was then ushered up from her seat in the audience to join Coolbrith. Coolbrith&#x27;s official status as California Poet Laureate was confirmed in 1919 as the &quot;Loved Laurel Crowned Poet of California&quot; by the California State Senate with no financial support attached.

Several months after the San Francisco fair, at the Panama–California Exposition held in San Diego, festivities included a series of Authors&#x27; Days, featuring 13 California writers. November 2, 1915, was &quot;Ina Coolbrith Day&quot;: her poems were recited, a lecture on her life was given by George Wharton James, and her poetry was set to music and performed on piano and voice, with compositions by James, Humphrey John Stewart, and Amy Beach.

In 1916, Coolbrith sent copies of her poetry collections to her cousin Joseph F. Smith who publicized her sending them to him and her identity as a niece of Joseph Smith, which upset her. She told him that &quot;To be crucified for a faith in which you believe is to be blessed. To be crucified for one in which you do not believe is to be crucified indeed.&quot; She assured him she was not angry but she certainly was not pleased.

Coolbrith continued to write and work to support herself. From 1909 to final publication in 1917, she painstakingly collected and edited a book of Stoddard&#x27;s poetry, writing a foreword and joining her short memorial poem &quot;At Anchor&quot; to verse submitted by Stoddard&#x27;s friends Joaquin Miller, George Sterling and Thomas Walsh. At the age of 80, McCracken wrote to Coolbrith to complain to her dear friend of still having to work for a living: &quot;The world has not used us well, Ina; California has been ungrateful to us. Of all the hundred thousands the state pays out in pensions of one kind and another, don&#x27;t you think you should be at the head of the pensioners, and I somewhere down below?&quot;

==Death and legacy==

In May 1923, Coolbrith&#x27;s friend Edwin Markham found her at the Hotel Latham in New York, &quot;very old, ill and moneyless&quot;. He asked Lotta Crabtree to gather help for her. Crippled with arthritis, Coolbrith was brought back to California where she settled in Berkeley to be cared for by her niece. In 1924, Mills College conferred upon her an honorary Master of Arts degree. Coolbrith published &quot;Retrospect: In Los Angeles&quot; in 1925. In April 1926, she received visitors such as her old friend, art patron Albert M. Bender, who brought young Ansel Adams to meet her. Adams made a photographic portrait of Coolbrith seated near one of her white Persian cats and wearing a large white mantilla on her head.

Coolbrith died on Leap Day, February 29, 1928, and was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland. Her grave (located in Plot 11 at ) was unmarked until 1986 when a literary society known as The Ina Coolbrith Circle placed a headstone. Her name is commemorated by Mount Ina Coolbrith, a peak near Beckwourth Pass in the Sierra Nevada mountains near State Route 70. Near her Russian Hill home, Ina Coolbrith Park, established earlier as a series of terraces ascending a steep hill, received a memorial plaque placed in 1947 by the San Francisco parlors of the Native Daughters of the Golden West. The park is known for its &quot;meditative setting and spectacular bay views&quot;.

&quot;Wings of Sunset&quot;, a book of Coolbrith&#x27;s later poetry, was published in the year after her death. Charles Joseph MacConaghy Phillips edited the collection, and wrote a brief memorial to Coolbrith&#x27;s life.

In 1933, the University of California established the Ina Coolbrith Memorial Poetry Prize, given annually to authors of the best unpublished poems written by undergraduate students enrolled at the University of the Pacific, Mills College, Stanford University, Santa Clara University, Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California, and any of the University of California campuses.
The California Writers Club (CWC) occasionally selects a member, one distinguished by &quot;exemplary service&quot;, to receive the Ina Coolbrith Award. In 2009, the award was given to Joyce Krieg, editor of the &quot;CWC Bulletin&quot;. In 2011, Kelly Harrison received the award for work on the anthology &quot;West Winds Centennial&quot;. In his 1997 novel &quot;Separations&quot;, author Oakley Hall set Coolbrith and others of her 1870 literary circle as main characters in the story. Hall was sympathetic to Coolbrith&#x27;s legacy, himself helping to develop new California writers through the forum Squaw Valley Writer&#x27;s Conference.

In 2001, a $63,000 sculpture by Scott Donahue was placed in Oakland&#x27;s central Frank Ogawa Plaza, adjacent to Oakland City Hall. The artist said his polychrome patchwork statue was a composite image of 20 women, historic and current, important to Oakland, including Coolbrith, Isadora Duncan, Julia Morgan and more. Entitled &quot;Sigame/Follow Me&quot;, the sculpture elicited protests because the city did not follow its own process for acquiring public art and because &quot;some people&quot;, according to Ben Hazard, Oakland&#x27;s Craft and Cultural Arts Department leader, &quot;just don&#x27;t like the sculpture&#x27;s looks&quot;. By late 2004, the sculpture had been removed to a remote former industrial site called Union Point Park on the Oakland Estuary, opening to the public in 2005.

The City of Berkeley in 2003 installed a series of 120 poem-imprinted cast-iron plates flanking one block of a downtown street, to become the Addison Street Poetry Walk. Former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Hass determined that one of Coolbrith&#x27;s works should be included. A plate bearing Coolbrith&#x27;s poem &quot;Copa De Oro (The California Poppy)&quot; in raised porcelain enamel text is set into the sidewalk at the high-traffic northwest corner of Addison and Shattuck Avenues.
In 2016, a path in the Berkeley Hills was renamed for Coolbrith. When byways in the Berkeley hills were named after Bret Harte, Charles Warren Stoddard, Mark Twain, and other literati in Coolbrith&#x27;s circle, women were not included. Through the efforts of the City of Berkeley, the Berkeley Historical Society, the Berkeley Historical Plaque Project, and the Berkeley Path Wanderers Association, the name of a stairway in the hills that connects Grizzly Peak Boulevard and Miller Avenue was changed from Bret Harte Lane to Ina Coolbrith Path. (Bret Harte still has three byways named for him in the area.) At the bottom of the stairway, the Berkeley Historical Society has installed a plaque to commemorate Coolbrith.

<text>The Separate Baptists in Christ are a denomination of Separate Baptists found mostly in United States.

==History==

The Separate Baptists had no formal statement of faith before 1776. They purported to only follow the Bible. In 1776 there was split in the Separate Baptist movement over the Arminian system. This split was in part due to the preaching of John Walker who was known as a &quot;very able preacher&quot;. At the 1776 session of the General Association of the Separate Baptists in Virginia, Elder John Waller used Corinthians 13:11 in his sermon against particular redemption which outlined the basis on which he and the ministers of churches he and they had started withdrew from the General Association to form a network of &quot;independent&quot; Baptist churches who were accused of being &quot;Arminians.&quot; In the 1780s many of the Separate Baptists who supported the Arminian view moved west into Kentucky and Tennessee. The Separate Baptists who are now known as the Separate Baptist in Christ come from these people who settled in Kentucky and Tennessee. They started the churches who formed the South Kentucky Association of the Separate Baptist in 1786. Over the years a large number of these churches folded into other groups like the United Baptists or Campbellites (also known as the Christian Churches). The South Kentucky Association of Separate Baptists choose not to stay in any union.

==Associations==

The present-day Separate Baptists in Christ descend from that association and others organized by it, which consists of the following surviving associations: Nolynn (KY, 1819); Ambraw (IL, 1844); Northern Indiana (IN, 1854); Central Indiana (IN, 1870); the Christian Unity in Virginia and North Carolina (1935), 
and Mt. Olive (TN, 1892 Dissolved around 2016). The old Kentucky Association is now called South Kentucky Association of Separate Baptists in Christ (org. 1785). A division of the Christian Unity Separate Baptist Association (org. 1935) united in fellowship with the Separate Baptists in 1975. Two associations have also been recently organized, the West Virginia Association and the Northeast Florida Association, each constituted with one church, but both have now dissolved. The churches and associations labored in 1912 to organize a general association, called the &quot;General Association of Separate Baptists&quot;. A general association had previously been organized in 1877, but it dissolved. Separate Baptist Missions, Inc. was formed in 1967. They also support Sunday Schools and youth camps. All local associations of Separate Baptists had participated in the General Association, but Ambraw withdrew in 1991 and Northern Indiana in 1992, each now independent associations. This division was precipitated by the General Association&#x27;s adoption of an article which rejected premillennialism: &quot;&quot;ARTICLE 12. We believe that, at Christ&#x27;s coming in the clouds of Heaven, all Christians will be gathered with Him in the clouds and that time shall be no more, thus leaving no time for a literal one thousand year reign&quot;.&quot;

== Separate Baptist in Christ Ordinances ==
Separate Baptists hold a standard orthodoxy in common with many other Baptists. They hold five ordinances, Baptism, the Lord&#x27;s Supper, the anointing with oil and laying on hands for the sick, right hand of fellowship, and feet washing. Separate Baptists hold many of these in common with Free Will Baptists, General Association of Baptists, Christian Baptist Church of God, Primitive Baptist, Pleasant Valley and Jasper Baptist Association, United Baptists, Union Baptists, Old Regular Baptists and many Independent Baptist Associations. Separate Baptists are Arminian in persuasion, believing &quot;that he who endures to the end, the same shall be saved&quot; rather than eternal security. Separate Baptist believe that a &quot;saved&quot; person can choose to turn from God to a life of sin. This is called &quot;backsliding.&quot; The Separate Baptist believe a backslider must ask God for forgiveness of their sin. Separate Baptists hold this in common with Free Will Baptists, General Baptist, the General Six-Principle Baptists and some United Baptists. In 1999, the churches of the General Association numbered 80, with about 7500 members. The Ambraw and Northern Indiana Associations consist of approximately 1500 members in about 20 churches. This makes the total membership of all Separate Baptists about 9000 in 100 churches.

==International Separate Baptist in Christ Missions==

There also are some Separate Baptists in Christ in the Ahmednagar district of India. These churches are not in association with the General Association. In 1993 Separate Baptist Missions, Inc. began contributing to missionaries Lonnie Palmer and Steve Palmer in their work among the Koulango in Ivory Coast, Africa, and have since began supporting Bro Jerry Ridge in the same mission.

<doc id="330523" wikidata="Q457289" url="?curid=330523" title="Siddhartha (novel)">
<text>Siddhartha: An Indian novel (; ) is a 1922 novel by Hermann Hesse that deals with the spiritual journey of self-discovery of a man named Siddhartha during the time of the Gautama Buddha. The book, Hesse&#x27;s ninth novel, was written in German, in a simple, lyrical style. It was published in the United States in 1951 by New Directions Publishing and became influential during the 1960s. Hesse dedicated the first part of it to the French writer Romain Rolland and the second part to Wilhelm Gundert, his cousin.

The word &quot;Siddhartha&quot; is made up of two words in the Sanskrit language: &quot;siddha&quot; (achieved) + &quot;artha&quot; (what was searched for), which together means &quot;he who has found meaning (of existence)&quot; or &quot;he who has attained his goals&quot;. In fact, the Buddha&#x27;s own name, before his renunciation, was Siddhartha Gautama, prince of Kapilavastu. In this book, the Buddha is referred to as &quot;Gotama&quot;.

==Plot==
The story takes place in ancient India, where Siddhartha decides to leave his home in the hope of gaining spiritual illumination by becoming an ascetic Śamaṇa. Joined by his best friend Govinda, Siddhartha fasts, becomes homeless, renounces all personal possessions, and intensely meditates. Eventually the pair seek out and personally speak with the enlightened Gautama, but although Govinda hastily joins the Buddha&#x27;s order, Siddhartha does not. For him, the Buddhist philosophy, though supremely wise, must be individually realized independently of instruction by a teacher. He thus resolves to carry on his quest alone.

Siddhartha crosses a river and the ferryman, whom Siddhartha is unable to pay, predicts that Siddhartha will return later to compensate him in some way. Venturing onward toward city life, Siddhartha encounters the courtesan Kamala, the most beautiful woman he has seen. She notes Siddhartha&#x27;s handsome appearance and fast wit, but warns him that he must become wealthy to win her affections so that she may teach him the art of love. Although Siddhartha despised materialistic pursuits as a Śamaṇa, he agrees now to Kamala&#x27;s suggestion. She directs him to the employ of Kamaswami, a local businessman, and insists that he have Kamaswami treat him as an equal rather than an underling. Siddhartha easily succeeds, providing a voice of patience and tranquility, which Siddhartha learned from his days as an ascetic, against Kamaswami&#x27;s fits of passion. Thus Siddhartha becomes a rich man and Kamala&#x27;s lover, but in his middle years he realizes that the luxurious lifestyle he has chosen is merely a game that lacks spiritual fulfillment. Leaving the bustle of the city, Siddhartha returns to the river, disillusioned and contemplating suicide. Falling into a meditative sleep, he is saved only by an internal experience of the holy word, Om.

The next morning, Siddhartha briefly reconnects with Govinda, who is passing through the area as a wandering Buddhist monk. Siddhartha decides to live the rest of his life in the presence of the spiritually inspirational river, companioning Vasudeva, the elderly ferryman, with whom he begins a humbler way of life. Although Vasudeva is a simple man, he has spiritual insight and relates that the river has many voices and significant messages to divulge to any who might listen.

Some years later, Kamala, now a Buddhist convert, is traveling to see the Buddha on his deathbed, accompanied by her reluctant young son, when she is bitten by a venomous snake near the river bank. Siddhartha recognizes her and she informs him that the boy is his own son. After Kamala&#x27;s death, Siddhartha attempts to console and raise the furiously resistant boy, until one day the child flees altogether. Although Siddhartha is desperate to follow the runaway, Vasudeva urges him to let the boy find his own path, just as Siddhartha did himself in his youth. Listening to the river with Vasudeva, Siddhartha realizes that time is an illusion and that all of his feelings and experiences, even those of suffering, are part of a great and ultimately jubilant fellowship of all things connected in the cyclical unity of nature. After Siddhartha&#x27;s moment of illumination, Vasudeva claims that his work is done and he must depart into the woods, leaving Siddhartha peacefully fulfilled and alone once more.

Toward the end of his life, Govinda hears about an enlightened ferryman and travels to Siddhartha, not initially recognizing him as his old childhood companion. Govinda asks the now-elderly Siddhartha to relate his wisdom and Siddhartha replies that for every true statement there is an opposite one that is also true; that language and the confines of time lead people to adhere to one fixed belief that does not account for the fullness of the truth. Because nature works in a self-sustaining cycle, every entity carries in it the potential for its opposite and so the world must always be considered complete. Siddhartha simply urges people to identify and love the world in its completeness. He then requests the puzzled Govinda to kiss his forehead; when he does so, Govinda experiences the same visions of timelessness that Siddhartha himself saw with Vasudeva by the river. Govinda then bows to his wise and radiantly smiling friend.

==Major themes==
In Hesse&#x27;s novel, experience, the totality of conscious events of a human life, is shown as the best way to approach understanding of reality and attain enlightenment⁠—⁠Hesse&#x27;s crafting of Siddhartha&#x27;s journey shows that understanding is attained not through intellectual methods, nor through immersing oneself in the carnal pleasures of the world and the accompanying pain of samsara; rather, it is the completeness of these experiences that allows Siddhartha to attain understanding.

Thus, individual events are meaningless when considered by themselves—⁠Siddhartha&#x27;s stay with the Shramanas and his immersion in the worlds of love and business do not &quot;ipso facto&quot; lead to nirvana, yet they cannot be considered distractions, for every action and event gives Siddhartha experience, which in turn leads to understanding.

A major preoccupation of Hesse in writing &quot;Siddhartha&quot; was to cure his &quot;sickness with life&quot; (&quot;Lebenskrankheit&quot;) by immersing himself in Indian philosophy such as that expounded in the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. The reason the second half of the book took so long to write was that Hesse &quot;had not experienced that transcendental state of unity to which Siddhartha aspires. In an attempt to do so, Hesse lived as a virtual semi-recluse and became totally immersed in the sacred teachings of both Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. His intention was to attain to that &#x27;completeness&#x27; which, in the novel, is the Buddha&#x27;s badge of distinction.&quot; The novel is structured on three of the traditional stages of life for Hindu males (student (&quot;brahmacharin&quot;), householder (&quot;grihastha&quot;) and recluse/renunciate (&quot;vanaprastha&quot;) as well as the Buddha&#x27;s Four Noble Truths (Part One) and Eightfold Path (Part Two) which form twelve chapters, the number in the novel. 

Ralph Freedman mentions how Hesse commented in a letter &quot;[my] Siddhartha does not, in the end, learn true wisdom from any teacher, but from a river that roars in a funny way and from a kindly old fool who always smiles and is secretly a saint.&quot; In a lecture about Siddhartha, Hesse claimed &quot;Buddha&#x27;s way to salvation has often been criticized and doubted, because it is thought to be wholly grounded in cognition. True, but it&#x27;s not just intellectual cognition, not just learning and knowing, but spiritual experience that can be earned only through strict discipline in a selfless life&quot;. Freedman also points out how &quot;Siddhartha&quot; described Hesse&#x27;s interior dialectic: &quot;All of the contrasting poles of his life were sharply etched: the restless departures and the search for stillness at home; the diversity of experience and the harmony of a unifying spirit; the security of religious dogma and the anxiety of freedom.&quot; Eberhard Ostermann has shown how Hesse, while mixing the religious genre of the legend with that of the modern novel, seeks to reconcile with the double-edged effects of modernization such as individualization, pluralism or self-disciplining. The character Siddhartha honors the character Gotama (Gautama Buddha) by not following him in person, but by following Gotama&#x27;s example. 

==Cultural reinterpretations==
&quot;Zachariah&quot;, an adaptation loosely based on two Hesse novels, including &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, was released as a musical Western in 1971. In the following year, the film version of the novel was released as &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, starring Shashi Kapoor and directed by Conrad Rooks.

Musical compositions based on the novel have included Claude Vivier&#x27;s symphonic poem, &quot;Siddhartha&quot; (1976), and Pete Townshend&#x27;s song &quot;The Ferryman&quot;, written for an amateur dramatisation in June 1976. By 2024 the novel had become a new &#x27;literary and musical reinvention&#x27; titled &quot;The Seeker&quot;, composed by Townshend&#x27;s wife Rachel Fuller and starring him as the ferryman. Earlier, in 2015, Joel Puckett composed a piece for wind ensemble titled &quot;That Secret from the River&quot;, based on the Ferryman&#x27;s words from the book: &quot;Have you also learned that secret from the river; that there is no such thing as time? That the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past nor the shadow of the future.&quot;

There was also an Indian-themed photographic essay by Fred Mayer published in 2011 under the title &quot;Homage to Hermann Hesse and His Siddhartha&quot;

<text>The Tupi or Tupian language family comprises some 70 languages spoken in South America, of which the best known are Tupi proper and Guarani.

==Homeland and &quot;urheimat&quot;==
Rodrigues (2007) considers the Proto-Tupian urheimat to be somewhere between the Guaporé and Aripuanã rivers, in the Madeira River basin. Much of this area corresponds to the modern-day state of Rondônia, Brazil. Five of the ten Tupian branches are found in this area, as well as some Tupi–Guarani languages (especially Kawahíb), making it the probable urheimat of these languages and maybe of its speaking peoples. Rodrigues believes the Proto-Tupian language dates back to around 3,000 BC.

==Language contact==
Tupian languages have extensively influenced many language families in South America. Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Arawa, Bora-Muinane, Guato, Irantxe, Jivaro, Karib, Kayuvava, Mura-Matanawi, Taruma, Trumai, Yanomami, Harakmbet, Katukina-Katawixi, Arawak, Bororo, Karaja, Macro-Mataguayo-Guaykuru, Takana, Nadahup, and Puinave-Kak language families due to contact.

==History, members and classification==
When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, they found that wherever they went along the vast coast of South America, most of the indigenous peoples spoke similar languages. Jesuit missionaries took advantage of these similarities, systematizing common standards then named &quot;línguas gerais&quot; (&quot;general languages&quot;), which were spoken in that region until the 19th century. The best known and most widely spoken of these languages was Old Tupi, a modern descendant of which is still used today by indigenous peoples around the Rio Negro region, where it is known as &quot;Nheengatu&quot; (), or the &quot;good language&quot;. However, the Tupi family also comprises other languages.

In the neighbouring Spanish colonies, Guarani, another Tupian language closely related to Old Tupi, had a similar history, but managed to resist the spread of Spanish more successfully than Tupi resisted Portuguese. Today, Guarani has seven million speakers, and is one of the official languages of Paraguay. The Tupian family also includes several other languages with fewer speakers. These share irregular morphology with the Je and Carib families, and Rodrigues connects them all as a Je–Tupi–Carib family.

===Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2012)===
Rodrigues &amp; Cabral (2012) list ten branches of Tupian, which cluster into Western Tupian and Eastern Tupian. Within Western and Eastern Tupian, the most divergent branches are listed first, followed by the core branches.
* Tupian
** Western Tupian
*** Arikém (2 languages)
*** Tuparí (6 languages)
*** Mondé (6 languages)
*** Puruborá
*** Ramaráma (Rondônia) (2 languages)
** Eastern Tupian
*** Yurúna (Jurúna) (3 languages)
*** Mundurukú (2 languages)
*** Mawé
*** Awetï
*** Tupi–Guarani (50 languages: Tupí [extinct], Guaraní (5 million speakers), etc.)
Meira and Drude (2015) posit a branch uniting Mawé and Aweti with Tupi-Guarani, also known as Maweti-Guarani. Purubora may form a branch together with Ramarama.

<text>The Israel Border Police () is the gendarmerie and border security branch of the Israel National Police. It is also commonly known by its Hebrew abbreviation Magav (), meaning border guard; its members are colloquially known as &quot;magavnikim&quot; (; singular &quot;magavnik&quot;). &quot;Border Guard&quot; is often used as the official name of the Israel Border Police in English. While its main task is securing Israel&#x27;s borders, it has also been deployed to assist the Israel Defense Forces, and for counter-terrorism and law enforcement operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Jerusalem.

The Israeli Border Police is known to include many soldiers from minority backgrounds, being a particularly popular choice for Druze recruits, and also including many soldiers from Circassian, Arab Christian, and Bedouin backgrounds.

==History==

The Border Police was founded in 1949 as the Frontier Corps (, &quot;Heil HaSfar&quot;), a gendarmerie under the IDF with the task of providing security in rural areas and along the borders. Over the following years, it was gradually transferred to the command of the Police and became the Border Police. During these years, it secured new settlements and countered infiltration of Palestinian fedayeen, especially from Egypt and Jordan.

During the 1956 Suez War, the Border Police was involved in the Kafr Qasim massacre. On the second day of the war, a curfew was imposed on the Israeli Arab village. Villagers who had worked in the village fields and were apparently unaware of the curfew were shot as they returned to the village, resulting in 49 dead. This event was strongly protested by the Israeli public and resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the obligation of soldiers to disobey manifestly illegal orders.

During the 1967 Six-Day War, the Border Police fought alongside the IDF. After the war, it was deployed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and charged with maintaining law and order as part of the military administration of Israeli-occupied territories. Since then, a significant portion of the Border Police&#x27;s activity has been in these territories, especially during the years of the First Intifada and the Second (al-Aqsa) Intifada.

In 1974, the counter-terror unit Yamam was established.

In the 2000 October Riots, the Border Police was used as the main branch of the treatment in the events. During the Second Intifada, the Border Police took a large part in the security activity.

In 2005, the Border Police participated in the implementation of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza.

The Border Police&#x27;s heaviest area of operation is Jerusalem. Virtually all &quot;soldiers&quot; seen patrolling Jerusalem&#x27;s streets are Border Guard Police officers. Approximately 20% of all Border Guard personnel in the country are in Jerusalem. Jerusalem MAGAV also provides security and conducts military operations, raids, and arrests on Palestinians in cities like Jenin, Nablus, Jericho, Qalqilya, Tulkarm, Ramallah, and Hebron.

The number of Border Guards is believed to be about 6,000 soldiers and officers.

==Structure==

The Border Police is composed of professional officers on payroll and field policemen redirected from the IDF (at age 18, Israelis can choose to serve in the Border Police instead of the IDF). All border policemen are trained in combat, counter-terrorism, riot control, and police work. Outstanding officers can train as specialists, such as snipers, buggy-drivers, dog operators, or bomb squad members.

Because of their combat training, border police are employed in areas with greater risk of riots, violence and terror. They serve mainly in the countryside, in Arab villages and towns (along with the regular police), near the borders and in the West Bank.

===Settlements security===
The Border Police is also responsible for security of rural settlements inside Israel with its Rural Police (Hebrew: שיטור כפרי, &quot;shitur kafri&quot;) units and Community Security Coordinators (Hebrew: רב&quot;ש, &quot;rabash&quot;). Rural policemen are full-time professional officers and security coordinators are a mixture of full-time and volunteer officers.

===Special Operations Units===
The Border Police has four Special forces units:

====Yamam====
The Yamam (, an acronym for &quot;Centralized Special Unit&quot; , &quot;Yeḥida Merkazit Meyuḥedet&quot;), also called in Hebrew and Israel&#x27;s National Counter Terror Unit (I.N.C.T.U.) in English, is Israel&#x27;s national counter-terrorism unit. The Yamam is capable of both hostage-rescue operations and offensive takeover raids against terrorist targets in civilian areas. Besides military and counter-terrorism duties, it also performs SWAT duties and undercover police work. The unit operates snipers, police dog (K9) handlers, rappelling teams, EOD experts, paramedics, and undercover operators.

YAMAM was formed in 1974 as a response to a wave of Palestinian terrorism. The unit has since carried out thousands of operations, killed hundreds of terrorists, and foiled countless terror attacks. It was awarded five citations of recommendation () from the Police Commissioner and one from the IDF Chief of general staff ().

====Yamas====
The Yamas is the undercover counter-terror unit.

The Yamas is often expected to carry out complex missions with little or no preparation, often involving daylight raids in volatile areas. It does not follow regular military or police command structure and answers directly to the Shabak. The IDF long denied its existence.

====Others====
* Samag (Tactical Counter-Crime and Counter-Terror Rapid Deployment Unit)
* Matilan (Intelligence Gathering and Infiltrations Interception Unit)

==Volunteer Border Guard==
The Border Guard also deploys many volunteers. These members serve in regular Border Guard units. The Border Guard relies on volunteer soldiers to reinforce its manpower and help maintain Israel&#x27;s security needs. The volunteer Border Guard are given special attention in sensitive places like Jerusalem where security threats are highest and sometimes double or even triple the manpower of full-time security forces in a given area.

Many of these special Border Guard volunteers are Jewish immigrants who immigrated to Israel from places like the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Italy, France, Germany, South Africa, South America, and the former Soviet Union.

Volunteer Border Guard members leave behind jobs and families on a regular basis to serve in this combat unit. Some come from cities like Beit Shemesh, Ofrah, Ashkelon, Ra&#x27;anana and Haifa. They are not paid for serving in the Border Guard and serve in their spare time.

==Commanders==

==Ranks==
Border Police ranks are the same as those of the Israel Police and are similarly sworn in: the ranks of police officers and junior officers on the shirt collar, ranks of officers and senior officers on the cover. But in field uniforms, Border Police officers wear rank insignia on a green background worn on epaulets on top of both shoulders or on green epaulets. Border Police branch insignia is worn on the cap or beret. Enlisted grades wear rank insignia on the sleeve, halfway between the shoulder and the elbow. The Border Police British Army style insignia are white with blue interwoven threads backed with the appropriate corps color.

;Others
==Uniforms==
The Border has several types of uniforms:

* Service dress (מדי אלף Madei Alef – Uniform &quot;A&quot;) – the everyday uniform which is a grey variant of the khaki Navy and Air Corps uniform. A green lanyard is worn on the left shoulder with the Class A uniform
* Field dress ( מדי ב Madei Bet – Uniform &quot;B&quot;) – worn into combat, training, work on base.

The first two resemble each other but the Madei Alef is made of higher quality materials in grey while the madei bet is in grey drab.

* Officers / Ceremonial dress (מדי שרד madei srad) – worn by officers, or during special events/ceremonies. Consists of a light yellow shirt and brown-gray trousers.

The service uniform for all Border Police personnel is grey. The uniforms consist of a two-pocket shirt, plain or combat trousers, sweater, jacket or blouse, and shoes or boots. The grey fatigues are the same for winter and summer and heavy winter gear is issued as needed. Women&#x27;s dress parallels the men&#x27;s but may substitute a skirt for the trousers.

Headgear included a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a field cap or bush hat worn with fatigues. Border Police personnel generally wear green berets in lieu of the service cap.

Some units have small variations in their uniforms such as certain Security and Tactical units in Jerusalem who wear the standard IDF olive fatigues.

==Weapons and equipment==

The primary Border Police weapons are the CAR-15 and M-16 rifles, some of which are attached to the M-203 grenade launcher. The Border Police also use standard IDF equipment such as vests and helmets. Special units of Border Police use Glock 17, Glock 19, Jericho, or FN HP pistols. Some units, such as the Jerusalem Patrol Unit, carry the Beretta M9-22LR .22LR pistol. Special units use a variety of other weapons, Ruger S22s, sniper rifles, submachine guns, and shotguns.

The Border Police extensively use riot dispersal means such as batons and shields, tear gas canisters, stun grenades, rubber bullets, and water cannons.

==Transportation==
The Border Police use Sufa, Carkal, Dawid wheeled armored personnel carriers and a variety of patrol cars and vehicles. Several units use motorcycles and ATVs.

==Memorial==

The Border Police Memorial and Heritage Center is in the western Carmel mountains near Zomet Iron at road 65.


==Criticism==
In 2001, the Israeli NGO B&#x27;tselem reported that violence against Palestinians in the occupied territories was widespread among Border Police units. Several cases of abuse, including the breaking of the hand of a three-year-old child, were documented over a short period of months. It added that prosecution of officers who perpetrate such acts was difficult, since Border Police, in contravention of the law, do not carry tags allowing them to be identified, and registering complaints against them was hindered by numerous bureaucratic obstacles, such as making travel permits to Israeli courts difficult to obtain.

<text>Yahoo! Groups was a free-to-use system of electronic mailing lists offered by Yahoo!.

Prior to February 2020, Yahoo! Groups was one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of online discussion boards. It allowed members to subscribe to various groups, read subscribed discussions online, view and share photos, files and bookmarks within a group, access a group calendar, create polls for group members, and receive email notifications of new discussion topics. Some groups were simply announcement boards, to which only the group moderators could post, while others were discussion forums. Depending on each group&#x27;s settings, membership could be open to everyone or only to invited or approved people.

On February 1, 2020, Yahoo! removed online access to discussions and all other features except simple membership management, essentially turning all groups into mailing lists, and on October 13, 2020, it announced that Yahoo Groups would shut down completely on December 15, 2020.

==History==

Yahoo! Groups was launched in early 2001 as an integration of technology from eGroups.com and community groups from both eGroups.com and Yahoo! Clubs.

Yahoo! Clubs was launched in 1998 as an extension of services developed by Yahoo! Message. In August 2000 Yahoo acquired eGroups.com. In 2001 Yahoo! deleted adult groups from its search directory, making it very difficult to locate Yahoo! groups with adult content. The &quot;Groups Updates Email&quot; feature was introduced in 2010. It summarized, in a single email, all the updates that occurred every twenty-four hours in all groups. 

In September 2010, a major facelift was rolled out, making Yahoo! Groups look very similar to Facebook. 
In December, Yahoo! Groups Japan emailed its users and posted a notice on its homepage, to announce that its service, which commenced in February 2004, would be closing on May 28, 2014.

In October 2019, Yahoo! announced that all content that had been posted to Yahoo! Groups will be deleted on December 14, 2019; that date was later amended to January 31, 2020. Yahoo! announced that adding new content would be blocked on October 28, 2019. 

Once the content was deleted, users of Yahoo! Groups were only able to browse the group directory, request invitations and, if members of a group, send messages to that group.

On October 13, 2020, Yahoo! announced they would be shutting down Yahoo! Groups on December 15, 2020. The site was closed down a few days after the advertised date, displaying a message that the service was officially shut down. This message stopped appearing at the end of January 2021 and the Yahoo! Groups web address began redirecting to the main Yahoo! page.

===Criticism and controversy ===
On August 31, 2010, Yahoo! Groups started rolling out a major software change, which was denounced by a large number of users. The re-model was completely abandoned on January 12, 2011.

According to a September 9, 2013 Reuters article, &quot;Americans use the Internet to abandon children adopted from overseas&quot;, Yahoo! and Facebook groups were being used, illegally and without government regulation, by parents to advertise unwanted children for &quot;private re-homing&quot;. Yahoo! immediately closed down the forums that Reuters brought to their attention, although Facebook did not.

==Site statistics==
In August 2008, Yahoo! Group staff reported that there were 113 million users, and nine million Groups using 22 languages.

In July 2010, the web analytics website Quantcast reported around 915 thousand unique visitors daily to the Yahoo! Groups website (US). In January 2011, that number had increased to 933 thousand unique visitors daily. The number did not include Yahoo! Group members who accessed the Groups site via email.

In September 2010, at its &quot;Product Runway&quot; event, Yahoo! told reporters that Yahoo! Groups had 115 million group members and that there were 10 million Yahoo! groups.

<doc id="330544" wikidata="Q387103" url="?curid=330544" title="Deschutes River">
<text>The Deschutes River ( ) in central Oregon is a major tributary of the Columbia River. The river provides much of the drainage on the eastern side of the Cascade Range in Oregon, gathering many of the tributaries that descend from the drier, eastern flank of the mountains. The Deschutes provided an important route to and from the Columbia for Native Americans for thousands of years, and then in the 19th century for pioneers on the Oregon Trail. The river flows mostly through rugged and arid country, and its valley provides a cultural heart for central Oregon. Today the river supplies water for irrigation and is popular in the summer for whitewater rafting and fishing.

The Deschutes flows generally north, as do several other large Oregon tributaries of the Columbia River, including the Willamette and John Day.

==Course==
The headwaters of the Deschutes River are at Little Lava Lake, a natural lake in the Cascade Range approximately northwest of the city of La Pine. The river flows south into Crane Prairie Reservoir, then into Wickiup Reservoir, from where it heads in a northeasterly direction past the resort community of Sunriver and into the city of Bend, about from the river mouth on the Columbia.

In central Bend, the river enters Mirror Pond, an impoundment behind Newport hydroelectric dam. The pond extends upstream to the Galveston Bridge and is a feature of Drake Park as well as Harmon, Pageant, and Brooks parks. From April through October, diversions to Central Oregon Irrigation District canals reduce the river flow between Bend and Pelton Reregulating Dam, at river mile (RM) 100 (river kilometer (RK) 160).
The river continues north from Bend, and just west of Redmond, Oregon. Here it passes by Eagle Crest Resort and Cline Falls State Scenic Viewpoint. As it heads north through the central Oregon high desert, the river carves a gorge bordered by large basalt cliffs. By the time it reaches Lake Billy Chinook, a reservoir west of Madras, the river is approximately below the surrounding plateau, the Little Agency Plains and Agency Plains. At Lake Billy Chinook the river is joined by the Crooked and Metolius rivers.

Beyond the dam, the river continues north in a gorge well below the surrounding countryside. It passes through the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, which includes the city of Warm Springs and the Kah-Nee-Ta resort. The river ends at its confluence with the Columbia River, southwest of Biggs Junction and from the Columbia&#x27;s mouth on the Pacific Ocean.

===Tributaries===
Named tributaries of the Deschutes River from source to mouth include Snow Creek then the Cultus River, Cultus Creek and Deer Creek, which enter at Crane Prairie Reservoir. Further downstream come the Fall River, the Little Deschutes River, and the Spring River followed by Tumalo Creek and Whychus Creek.

The Metolius River and the Crooked River are next, both entering at Lake Billy Chinook. Then come Seekseequa Creek and Willow Creek followed by Dry Hollow and Campbell, Shitike and Trout creeks, after which comes the Warm Springs River. Further downstream are Swamp, Skookum, Oak, Antoken, Cove, Eagle, Nena, Wapinitia and Bakeoven creeks. Spring Creek is next, followed by Oak Springs Creek and the White River. Below that are Winterwater and Elder creeks.

==History==
Prior to 80,000 years ago, the river ran along the east side of Pilot Butte and a lava flow from Lava Top Butte filled in this ancient channel. Previously, the basalt of the Bend lava flow, associated with the Lava River Cave, had diverted the river westward to its present-day location.

The river was named &quot;Rivière des Chutes&quot; or &quot;Rivière aux Chutes&quot;, French for &quot;River of the Falls&quot;, during the period of fur trading. The waterfall it referred to was the Celilo Falls on the Columbia River, near where the Deschutes flowed into it. (These falls no longer exist, having been inundated by the lake behind The Dalles Dam).

Lewis and Clark encountered the river on October 22, 1805, and referred to it by the Native American name &quot;Towarnehiooks&quot;; on their return journey they gave it the new name &quot;Clarks River&quot;. Variant names include Clarks River, River of the Falls, Riviere des Chutes, Chutes River, and Falls River.

During the middle 19th century, the river was a major obstacle for immigrants on the Oregon Trail. The major crossing point on the river was near its mouth in present-day Deschutes River State Recreation Area. Many immigrants camped on the bluff on the west side of the river after making the crossing. The remains of the trail leading up to the top of the bluff are still visible.

In 1910, Mirror Pond was created by the construction of the Bend Water, Light &amp; Power Company dam on the river in Bend. The dam provided the city with its initial source of electricity. The dam has been owned by Pacific Power since 1930 and still produces electricity that supplies approximately 400 Bend households.

In 1908, two competing railroad companies, the Deschutes Railroad and the Oregon Trunk Railway, raced to build a line from the mouth of the river to Bend. The Deschutes Railroad, a Union Pacific subsidiary, was owned by Edward H. Harriman and the Oregon Trunk was owned by James J. Hill.

In 1964, on the Deschutes River, Portland General Electric (PGE) built, what was at the time, the largest hydroelectric dam in Oregon. This dam, named Round Butte Dam, stands above Lake Simtustus, a reservoir impounded by Pelton Dam.

==Fishing==

The river is world-renowned for its fly fishing. It is home to Columbia River redband trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri&quot;) known locally as &quot;redsides&quot;. The redsides grow larger than most and also have a distinct darker red stripe than most wild rainbow trout. They are abundant in this stretch of the river, which has counts of 1,700 fish of 7 inches in size per mile (1,100 fish of 18 centimeters in size per kilometer) above Sherar&#x27;s Falls, and they are noticeably stronger than trout who do not have to cope with life in such a big, powerful river. The average catch for these fish is , and some are much larger. These redside or redband trouts are found throughout the river. Fishing for them is most popular from Warm Springs down to Macks Canyon (Warm Springs Reservation owns the entire Deschutes west bank from south of Maupin to Lake Billy Chinook and on up to Jefferson Creek on the Metolius River arm) below Pelton Dam. Fishing from Tribal lands requires special permits. From Pelton Dam to the mouth the Deschutes is one of America&#x27;s most productive trout waters and a top producer of summer steelhead, managed primarily for wild trout. This stretch of river drops , carving a volcanic rock canyon deep.

Fly fishermen come from around the world in the last two weeks in May through the first two weeks in June to take advantage of the hatching stoneflies, both salmonflies and golden stoneflies (&quot;Hesperoperla pacifica&quot;). These insects are in the river year-round; however their large adults are a major food source for the fish: artificial weighted stonefly nymph patterned tied flies are a staple for Deschutes anglers year round.

Sport fishing for Steelhead occurs in the river from the mouth to Round Butte Dam. Sport fishing for spring and fall Chinook salmon occurs from the mouth to Sherars Falls. Tribal fishing for Chinook and steelhead occurs at Sherars Falls.

Crane Prairie Reservoir, the first major lake/reservoir the Deschutes flows into, offers some of the best rainbow trout fishing in Oregon, with a large number of rainbows in the 4-10 pound range and some reaching 20 pounds. These trout are renowned for their size and are given the nickname &quot;cranebows&quot;. Other fish found in Crane Prairie are brook trout, kokanee salmon, largemouth bass, black crappie, tui chub, three-spined stickleback, and whitefish. Fly, lure, and bait fishing are popular methods, with the majority of trout fisherman casting or trolling in the channels. For the best chance of catching large fish, a boat or other flotation device is recommended as the channels can be wide and deep.

Located roughly seven miles southeast of Crane Prairie Reservoir, you will find Wickiup Reservoir. Wickiup Reservoir holds a wide variety of species open to angling. Wickiup holds a reputable amount of both kokanee and Coho salmon. It is not uncommon to catch rainbow trout, brook trout, whitefish and chub. However, most anglers whether they know it or not, are targeting large brown trout. Wickiup Reservoir holds many brown trout in the five to eight pound range, and has also been known to produce brown trout in the mid-twenty pound range. This reservoir is most easily fished from a boat due to its depth. Most people find success in trolling lures horizontally through the depths of the reservoir. Vertical jigging in an aggressive manner can be an effective method of targeting the salmon species of the reservoir. Bank fishing offers dry fly-fishing enthusiasts an opportunity to catch fish hiding under the obstructions of the shallows.

In Lake Billy Chinook, there are fisheries for kokanee, bull trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, and several warm-water species such as large mouth bass and a very large population of small mouth bass. There are also periodic commercial fisheries for crayfish. The bull trout that are caught in this reservoir are some of the largest bull trout caught on the west coast. The numbers are scarce because the bulls are threatened; however, numbers have risen every year since they became protected. The lake allows an individual to keep a bull trout that measures more than . (This is included for a daily bag limit.)

==River use==
Much of the flow of the upper Deschutes River is diverted into canals to irrigate farmland; irrigation districts take nearly 98% of the river&#x27;s flow in the summer months. The growth of cities like Bend and Redmond also increased demand on the river&#x27;s water, which is over-allocated. Because the existing canals lose about half of their water due to seepage, there is pressure to convert these canals into pipelines, a move that is resisted by many locals for historic and aesthetic reasons. Golf courses have also been an issue with water allocation. There are 13 golf courses throughout Bend, Redmond, and Sunriver.

There are primarily two sections of the river popular for whitewater rafting and kayaking. The upstream section known as the Big Eddy is a short segment upriver from the city of Bend between Dillon and Lava Island falls. The lower and more heavily used section is from the town of Warm Springs downstream to just above Sherars Falls. The densest use is from RM 56—about above Maupin—to RM 44, just above Sherars Falls.

<text>Old Tupi, Ancient Tupi or Classical Tupi () is a classical Tupian language which was spoken by the indigenous Tupi people of Brazil, mostly those who inhabited coastal regions in South and Southeast Brazil. In the words of Brazilian tupinologist Eduardo Navarro, &quot;it is the classical indigenous language of Brazil, and the one which had the utmost importance to the cultural and spiritual formation of the country&quot;.

Old Tupi belongs to the Tupi–Guarani language family, and has a written history spanning the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries. In the early colonial period, Tupi was used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; throughout Brazil by Europeans and Amerindians, and had literary usage, but it was later suppressed almost to extinction. Today, its sole living descendant is the Nheengatu language.

As the most important native language of Brazil, it is the origin of most city names of indigenous origin (Pindamonhangaba, Ubatuba, Botucatu, Jacareí). It also names several plants and animals, and many proper names are tupi names, such as Moacir, Iara, Iracema and Jandaia. It has a rich literature, which includes catechisms, poems and plays.

The names Old Tupi or Classical Tupi are used for the language in English and by modern scholars (it is referred to as in Portuguese). It has previously been known, in Portuguese, as &quot;Brazilian language&quot;.

== Linguistic description ==
The following is a summary of the main characteristics of Classical Tupi, its typology and other distinguishing features.

* Tupi is a SOV language but was influenced by its Portuguese superstratum toward the latter&#x27;s SVO,
* It presents a system of vowel symmetry where each of the six phonemic oral vowels has its nasal phonemic counterpart: /i/, /ĩ/; /ɨ/, /ɨ̃/; /u/, /ũ/; /ɛ/, /ɛ̃/; /ɔ/, /ɔ̃/; /a/, /ã/.
* Its consonantal inventory, on the other hand, is considered &quot;relatively small&quot;.
* It is neither isolating, fusional, agglutinative or polysynthetic, rather displaying features of each, with none significantly more prevalent.
* There is no number, case or gender distinction in nouns.
* There are no marks of definiteness.
* It contains an inclusive first person plural (inclusive &quot;we&quot;), as well as an exclusive one, which does not include the listener.

== History ==

Old Tupi was first spoken by the Tupinambá people, who lived under cultural and social conditions very unlike those found in Europe. It is quite different from Indo-European languages in phonology, morphology, and grammar, but it was adopted by many Luso-Brazilians born in Brazil as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

It belonged to the Tupi–Guarani language family, which stood out among other South American languages for the vast territory it covered. Until the 16th century, these languages were found throughout nearly the entirety of the Brazilian coast, from Pará to Santa Catarina, and the Río de la Plata basin. Today, Tupi languages are still heard in Brazil (states of Maranhão, Pará, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, and Espírito Santo), as well as in French Guiana, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina.

It is a common mistake to speak of the &quot;Tupi–Guarani language&quot;: Tupi, Guarani and a number of other minor or major languages all belong to the Tupian language family, in the same sense that English, Romanian, and Sanskrit belong to the Indo-European language family. One of the main differences between the two languages was the replacement of Tupi by the glottal fricative in Guarani.

The first accounts of the Old Tupi language date back from the early 16th century, but the first written documents containing actual information about it were produced from 1575 onwards – when Jesuits André Thévet and José de Anchieta began to translate Catholic prayers and biblical stories into the language. Another foreigner, Jean de Lery, wrote the first (and possibly only) Tupi &quot;phrasebook&quot;, in which he transcribed entire dialogues. Lery&#x27;s work is the best available record of how Tupi was actually spoken.

In the first two or three centuries of Brazilian history, nearly all colonists coming to Brazil would learn the &quot;tupinambá&quot; variant of Tupi, as a means of communication with both the Indigenous people and with other early colonists who had adopted the language.

The Jesuits, however, not only learned to speak &quot;tupinambá&quot;, but also encouraged the natives to keep it. As a part of their missionary work, they translated some literature into it and also produced some original work written directly in Tupi. José de Anchieta reportedly wrote more than 4,000 lines of poetry in &quot;tupinambá&quot; (which he called &quot;lingua Brasilica&quot;) and the first Tupi grammar. Luís Figueira was another important figure of this time, who wrote the second Tupi grammar, published &quot;circa&quot; 1628. In the second half of the 18th century, the works of Anchieta and Figueira were republished and Father João Filipe Bettendorff wrote a new and more complete catechism. By that time, the language had made its way into the clergy and was the &quot;de facto&quot; national language of Brazil – though it was probably seldom written, as the Roman Catholic Church held a near monopoly of literacy.

When the Portuguese Prime Minister Marquis of Pombal expelled the Jesuits from Brazil in 1759, the language started to wane quickly, as few Brazilians were literate in it. A new rush of Portuguese immigration had been taking place since the early 18th century, due to the discovery of gold, diamonds, and gems in the interior of Brazil, and these new colonists spoke only their mother tongue. Old Tupi survived as a spoken language (used by Europeans and Indian populations alike) only in isolated inland areas, far from the major urban centres. Its use by a few non-Indian speakers in those isolated areas would last for over a century still.

== Tupi research ==

When the Portuguese first arrived on the shores of modern-day Brazil, most of the tribes they encountered spoke very closely related dialects. The Portuguese (and particularly the Jesuit priests who accompanied them) set out to proselytise the natives. To do so most effectively, doing so in the natives&#x27; own languages was convenient, so the first Europeans to study Tupi were those priests.

The priests modeled their analysis of the new language after the one with which they had already experienced: Latin, which they had studied in the seminary. In fact, the first grammar of Tupi—written by the Jesuit priest José de Anchieta and published in 1595—is structured much like a contemporary Latin grammar. While this structure is not optimal, it certainly served its purpose of allowing its intended readership (Catholic priests familiar with Latin grammars) to get enough of a basic grasp of the language to be able to communicate with and evangelise the natives. Also, the grammar sometimes regularised or glossed over some regional differences in the expectation that the student, once &quot;in the field&quot;, would learn these finer points of the particular dialect through use with his flock.

Significant works were a Jesuit catechism of 1618, with a second edition of 1686; another grammar written in 1687 by another Jesuit priest, Luís Figueira; an anonymous dictionary of 1795 (again published by the Jesuits); a dictionary published by Antônio Gonçalves Dias, a well-known 19th century Brazilian poet and scholar, in 1858; and a chrestomathy published by Dr Ernesto Ferreira França in 1859. The most recent dictionary is the &quot;Old Tupi Dictionary&quot; (2013), by the Brazilian scholar Eduardo de Almeida Navarro.

== Tupinology ==
In Brazil, tupinology is the study of tupi language and literature. It began in 1901, with the work of Theodoro Sampaio. An individual who dedicates themselves to the field of tupinology is a tupinologist.

== Phonology ==
The phonology of &quot;tupinambá&quot; has some interesting and unusual features. For instance, it does not have the lateral approximant or the multiple vibrant rhotic consonant . It also has a rather small inventory of consonants and a large number of pure vowels (12).

This led to a Brazilian pun about this language, that native Brazilians &quot;não têm fé, nem lei, nem rei&quot; (have neither faith, nor law, nor king) as the words &quot;fé&quot; (faith), &quot;lei&quot; (law) and &quot;rei&quot; (king) could not be pronounced by a native Tupi speaker (they would say &quot;pé&quot;, &quot;re&#x27;i&quot; and &quot;re&#x27;i&quot;). It is also a double pun because Brazil has not had a king for more than two centuries.

=== Vowels ===
The nasal vowels are fully vocalic, without any trace of a trailing or . They are pronounced with the mouth open and the palate relaxed, not blocking the air from resounding through the nostrils. These approximations, however, must be taken with caution, as no actual recording exists, and Tupi had at least seven known dialects.

=== Consonants ===

=== Alternative view ===
According to Nataniel Santos Gomes, however, the phonetic inventory of Tupi was simpler:
* Consonants:
** p, t, k, &#x27; ()
** b ()
** s, x ()
** m, n, ñ ()
** û (), î ()
** r ()
* Vowels
** i, y (), u, ĩ, ỹ, ũ
** e, o, õ, ẽ
** a, ã

This scheme does not regard Ŷ as a separate semivowel, does not consider the existence of G (), and does not differentiate between the two types of NG ( and ), probably because it does not regard MB (), ND () and NG () as independent phonemes, but mere combinations of P, T, and K with nasalization.

Santos Gomes also remarks that the stop consonants shifted easily to nasal stops, which is attested by the fitful spelling of words like &quot;umbu&quot; (&quot;umu&quot;, &quot;ubu&quot;, &quot;umbu&quot;, &quot;upu&quot;, &quot;umpu&quot;) in the works of the early missionaries and by the surviving dialects.

According to most sources, Tupi semivowels were more consonantal than their IPA counterparts. The Î, for instance, was rather fricative, thus resembling a very slight , and Û had a distinct similarity with the voiced stop (possibly via , which would likewise be a fricative counterpart of the labiovelar semivowel), thus being sometimes written &quot;gu&quot;. As a consequence of that character, Tupi loanwords in Brazilian Portuguese often have &quot;j&quot; for Î and &quot;gu&quot; for Û.

== Orthography ==

It would have been almost impossible to reconstruct the phonology of Tupi if it did not have a wide geographic distribution. The surviving Amazonian Nhengatu and the close Guarani correlates (Mbyá, Nhandéva, Kaiowá and Paraguayan Guarani) provide material that linguistic research can still use for an approximate reconstruction of the language.

Scientific reconstruction of Tupi suggests that Anchieta either simplified or overlooked the phonetics of the actual language when he was devising his grammar and his dictionary.

The writing system employed by Anchieta is still the basis for most modern scholars. It is easily typed with regular Portuguese or French typewriters and computer keyboards (but not with character sets such as ISO-8859-1, which cannot produce &quot;ẽ&quot;, &quot;ĩ&quot;, &quot;ũ&quot;, &quot;ŷ&quot; and &quot;ỹ&quot;).

Its key features are:
* The tilde indicating nasalisation: &quot;a&quot; → &quot;ã&quot;.
* The circumflex accent indicating a semivowel: &quot;i&quot; → &quot;î&quot;.
* The acute accent indicating the stressed syllable: &quot;abá&quot;.
* The use of the letter &quot;x&quot; for the voiceless palatal fricative , a spelling convention common in the languages of the Iberian Peninsula but unusual elsewhere.
* The use of the digraphs &quot;yg&quot; (for Ŷ), &quot;gu&quot; (for ), &quot;ss&quot; (to make intervocalic S unvoiced), and of &quot;j&quot; to represent the semivowel .
* Hyphens are not used to separate the components of compounds except in the dictionary or for didactical purposes.

==Pronouns==

Tupi features clusivity, i.e., a distinction between inclusive (including the addressee) and exclusive (excluding the addressee) first-person pronouns. Personal pronouns in Tupi come in two series, each with its own uses. 

:* &quot;a&#x27;e&quot; means this/these or that/those, but it can also be used as a third-person personal pronoun, both singular and plural.

First series pronouns are generally used alone or along with verbs of the first class (those that are conjugated). For example: &quot;ixé a-karukatu&quot;: I ate well. &quot;Abápe morubixaba? – Ixé&quot;: who&#x27;s the cacique? - I (am).

Second series pronouns are used in many different cases:
* alongside adjectives: &quot;xe porang&quot;, I&#x27;m beautiful.
* with verbs of the second class (see below): &quot;nde ma&#x27;enduar ixé resé&quot;, you remember me.
* in a genitive construction: &quot;i membyra&quot;, her son.

==Verbs==
Old Tupi verbs are divided in two classes. First class are conjugated, with person markers coming at the beginning of the word. In addition, verbs can represent a present, past, or future action because, unlike Portuguese, they do not express time. (The future, in particular, is done by adding the particle &quot;-ne&quot; to the end of the sentence, but this does not change the fact that the verb itself does not express time.)
Verbs from the second class are not conjugated and are used only with pronouns of the second series. This is because they are actually adjectives generally indicating a state or characteristic.

* &quot;xe ma&#x27;endurar&quot; (I remember)
* &quot;nde u&#x27;u&quot; (you cough) (sg.)
* &quot;i membyrar&quot; (she gives birth)
* &quot;oré rambûer&quot; (we fail) (excl.)
* &quot;îandé nhyrõ&quot; (we forgive) (incl.)
* &quot;pe poasem&quot; (you moan) (pl.)
* &quot;i pytu&quot; (they breathe)

=== Transitive verbs ===
Objects of transitive verbs in Old Tupi may come in many positions relative to the verb: either before, after or &quot;incorporated&quot; into it. In the last case, it comes after the person markers (&quot;a&quot;-, &quot;ere&quot;-, &quot;o&quot;-, etc.) in first class verbs, but before the root. For an example of incorporation:

* &quot;a-pirá-kutuk&quot; (I poke the fish)
:: &quot;a-&quot; is the first-person marker, &quot;pirá&quot; means fish and &quot;kutuk&quot; to poke.

When the object is not incorporated, then in it is replaced by a pleonastic third-person pronoun&quot;-i-&quot;, even if the object is present elsewhere in the phrase. Monosyllabic verbs use &quot;-îo-&quot; (or also &quot;-nho-&quot; close to nasals) instead of &quot;-i-&quot;, and a few others use &quot;-s-&quot; instead. Some examples:

*&quot;pirá a-î-kutuk&quot; (literally: the fish, I it poke) or &quot;a-î-kutuk pirá&quot;
:: The pronoun &quot;-i-&quot; is incorporated and becomes a diphthong.

* &quot;ere-îo-sub oré&quot;: you visit us (excl.).
:: The monosyllabic verb &quot;sub&quot; (to visit) has &quot;-îo-&quot; incorporated.

* &quot;a-îo-mim&quot; (or &quot;a-nho-mim&quot;) &quot;u&#x27;ubá&quot;: I hide the arrow.
:: The monosyllabic nasal verb &quot;mim&quot; (to hide) has &quot;-îo-&quot; or &quot;-nho-&quot; incorporated.

* &quot;São Pedro itangapema o-s-ekyî&quot;: Saint Peter pulled the sword (&quot;itangapema&quot;).
:: The verb &quot;ekyî&quot; (to pull) requires &quot;-s-&quot; instead of &quot;-i-&quot;. From Anchieta, &quot;Catecismo na Língua Brasílica&quot;.

* &quot;pe-îuká îagûareté&quot;: you (pl.) killed the jaguar.
:: For &quot;îuká&quot; (to kill), the incorporated object is absorbed by the verb since it already begins with &quot;î&quot;.

===Future===

To express something happening in the future, the clitic &quot;-ne&quot; is always added to the last word in the sentence, independent of its grammatical class. This clitic has other meanings and may then be used as a particle in different positions.

* &quot;Abá kori ka&#x27;ape osóne&quot;. The indian will go to the woods today.
* &quot;Oro&#x27;u onhemongyraba&#x27;eramane&quot;. We shall eat what fattens us. (The verb here is &quot;oro&#x27;u&quot;, but &quot;-ne&quot; for expressing the future always goes at the end of the sentence.)
* &quot;Pytuna i ro&#x27;yne&quot;. The night shall be cold (there is no verb &quot;to be&quot; in Old Tupi)
* &quot;Kururu opererekypyne&quot;. The frog will begin (&quot;ypy&quot;) to jump (&quot;pererek&quot;)
* &quot;Pytuna o&#x27;aryne&quot;. The night will fall. (&quot;y&quot; is insterted between the verb and the clitic to avoid consonants meeting, which isn&#x27;t possible in Old Tupi)

=== Verb moods ===
Tupi verbs are divided into its verbal and its nominal forms. Each division contains its respective verb moods.

== Nouns ==
All nouns in old Tupi end in a vowel. In the case of a verb or adjective substantivized, the suffix &quot;-a&quot; is added, if it does not already end in a vowel.

* &quot;Sem&quot;: to exit. &quot;Sema&quot;: the going out, the exit
* &quot;Pererek&quot;: to jump. &quot;Perereka&quot;: the jump, the leap.
* &quot;Só&quot; (verb): to go. &quot;Só&quot; (noun): the going, the going away.
* &quot;Porang&quot;: beautiful. &quot;Poranga&quot;: the beauty

The same occurs when a noun and an adjective are in composition. In this way:

* &quot;Kunhãporanga&quot;: beautiful woman (&quot;kunhã&quot;, woman; &quot;porang&quot;, beautiful; &quot;a&quot;, suffix)

=== Noun tenses ===
Unlike the Portuguese language, the tense of an action, in old Tupi, is expressed by the noun, not the verb. Such tenses are future, past and a time called &quot;unreal&quot;, which is similar to the future perfect, of Portuguese. They are indicated, respectively, by the adjectives &quot;-ram, -pûer&quot; and &quot;-rambûer&quot;. These, when in composition with the noun, receive the suffix &quot;-a&quot;, as explained above.

* Future: &quot;ka&#x27;a-ram-a&quot; = forest that will be (that has not yet been born; &quot;ka&#x27;a&quot; means forest)
* Past: &quot;ka&#x27;a-pûer-a&quot; = forest that was (place where there is no more forest; hence the word capoeira)
* Unreal: &quot;ybyrá-rambûer-a&quot; = tree that would be (if it had not been cut down)

===Augmentative and diminutive ===
The degrees of the noun (augmentative and diminutive) are made by the suffixes &quot;-&#x27;ĩ&#x27; or &#x27;-&#x27;i&#x27;&quot;, for the diminutive, and &quot;-ûasu&#x27; or &#x27;-usu&#x27;&quot; for the augmentative (these suffixes may suffer several phonetic transformations. Here are some examples with their explanations:

==Numerals==
In Old Tupi, there are only numerals from one to four, both cardinal and ordinal, as the need for mathematical precision was small in a primitive economy. Cardinal numerals can either come after or before the noun they refer to, while ordinals only come after. For example, in the case of cardinal numbers, and are equivalent terms, meaning &quot;two pigeons&quot;. In the case of ordinals, means &quot;first son (of a man)&quot; and means &quot;third day&quot;.

== Postpositions ==
They are the same as prepositions, but they come after the term they refer to. They are divided into unstressed postpositions, which are appended to the previous word, and stressed postpositions, which are written separately.

Just like in Portuguese or English, some verbs require certain postpositions:
* (Peter is afraid of his mother; the verb requires the preposition )
* (The father looks at his son; the verb requires )

==Negation==
There are many ways to negate a sentence in Old Tupi.

===&quot;na ... i&quot;===
Used to negate verbs in the indicative mood. Before a vowel, &quot;na&quot; just becomes &quot;n&quot;.

* &quot;n&#x27;a-syk-i&quot;: I didn&#x27;t arrive
* &quot;n&#x27;ere-só-î&quot;: you (sg.) didn&#x27;t go
* &quot;n&#x27;o-karuî&quot;: he/she didn&#x27;t eat
* &quot;n&#x27;oro-petymbu-î&quot;: we (excl.) didn&#x27;t smoke
* &quot;n&#x27;îa-nhe&#x27;eng-i&quot;: we (incl.) didn&#x27;t speak
* &quot;na pe-&#x27;ytab-i&quot;: you (pl) didn&#x27;t swim
* &quot;n&#x27;o-sykyîé-î&quot;: they don&#x27;t fear

The same rule applies for adjectives:

* &quot;Xe porang&quot; (I&#x27;m beautiful)
* &quot;Na xe porang-i&quot; (I&#x27;m not beautiful)
* &quot;I puku&quot; (he/she is tall)
* &quot;N&#x27;i puku-î&quot; (he/she isn&#x27;t tall)

===&quot;-e&#x27;ym(a)&quot;===
Negates verbs in the infinitive or gerund form.

*&quot;Kunhã osepyîak pitanga ker-e&#x27;yma&quot;
*The woman sees that the child doesn&#x27;t sleep (literally: the woman sees the not sleeping of the child)

===&quot;na ... ruã&quot;===

Used to negate a noun, pronoun or an adverb.

* &quot;Îagûara ixé&quot; (I&#x27;m the jaguar)
* &quot;Na îagûara ruã ixé&quot; (I&#x27;m not the jaguar)

===&quot;na ... i xué&quot;===
Negates sentences in the future. The clitic &quot;-ne&quot; is still used.

* &quot;N&#x27;asóî xué nde tápe korine&quot;
* I won&#x27;t go to your village today
* &quot;Kunimĩ n&#x27;okuruki xuéne&quot;
* The boy won&#x27;t grumble

===&quot;umẽ&quot; or &quot;ymẽ&quot;===
Negates verbs in the imperative and permissive moods.

* &quot;Eporapiti umẽ!&quot;
* Don&#x27;t kill people! (from Anchieta, &quot;Catecismo na Língua Brasílica&quot;)
* &quot;Tosepîaky bé umẽ kûarasy&quot;
* Let they not see the sun anymore. (from Anchieta, &quot;Teatro&quot;)

== Grammatical structure ==
Tupi was an agglutinative language with moderate degree of fusional features (nasal mutation of stop consonants in compounding, the use of some prefixes and suffixes), although Tupi is not a polysynthetic language.

Tupi parts of speech did not follow the same conventions of Indo-European languages:
* Verbs are &quot;conjugated&quot; for person (by means of prepositioning subject or object pronouns) but not for tense or mood (the very notion of mood is absent). All verbs are in the present tense.
* Nouns are &quot;declined&quot; for tense by means of suffixing the aspect marker (Nominal TAM) but not for gender or number.
* There is a distinction of nouns in two classes: &quot;higher&quot; (for things related to human beings or spirits) and &quot;lower&quot; (for things related to animals or inanimate beings). The usual manifestation of the distinction was the use of the prefixes &quot;t-&quot; for high-class nouns and &quot;s-&quot; for low-class ones, so that &quot;tesá&quot; meant &quot;human eye&quot;, and &quot;sesá&quot; meant &quot;the eye of an animal&quot;. Some authors argue that it is a type of gender inflection.
* Adjectives cannot be used in the place of nouns, neither as the subject nor as the object nucleus (in fact, they cannot be used alone).

Tupi had a split-intransitive grammatical alignment. Verbs were preceded by pronouns, which could be subject or object forms. Subject pronouns like &quot;a-&quot; &quot;I&quot; expressed the person was in control, while object pronouns like &quot;xe-&quot; &quot;me&quot; signified the person was not. The two types could be used alone or combined in transitive clauses, and they then functioned like subject and object in English:
* &quot;A-bebé&quot; = I-fly, &quot;I can fly&quot;, &quot;I flew&quot;.
* &quot;Xe pysyka&quot; = me catch, &quot;Someone has caught me&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m caught&quot;.
* &quot;A-î-pysyk&quot; = I-him-catch, &quot;I have caught him&quot;.

Although Tupi verbs were not inflected, a number of pronominal variations existed to form a rather complex set of aspects regarding who did what to whom. That, together with the temporal inflection of the noun and the presence of tense markers like &quot;koára&quot; &quot;today,&quot; made up a fully functional verbal system.

Word order played a key role in the formation of meaning:
* &quot;taba abá-im&quot; (village + man + tiny) = tiny man from the village
* &quot;taba-im abá&quot; = man from the small village

Tupi had no means to inflect words for gender, so used adjectives instead. Some of these were:
* &quot;apyŷaba&quot; = man, male
* &quot;kuñã&quot; = woman, female
* &quot;kunumĩ&quot; = boy, young male
* &quot;kuñãtãĩ&quot; = girl, young female
* &quot;mena&quot; = male animal
* &quot;kuñã&quot; = female animal

The notion of gender was expressed, once again, together with the notion of age and that of &quot;humanity&quot; or &quot;animality&quot;.

The notion of plural was also expressed by adjectives or numerals:
* &quot;abá&quot; = man; &quot;abá-etá&quot; = many men

Unlike Indo-European languages, nouns were not implicitly masculine except for those provided with natural gender: &quot;abá&quot; &quot;man&quot; and &quot;kuñã&quot;[&quot;tã&quot;] &quot;woman/girl&quot;; for instance.

Without proper verbal inflection, all Tupi sentences were in the present or in the past. When needed, tense is indicated by adverbs like &quot;ko ara&quot;, &quot;this day&quot;.

Adjectives and nouns, however, had temporal inflection:
* &quot;abáûera&quot; &quot;he who was once a man&quot;
* &quot;abárama&quot; &quot;he who shall be a man someday&quot;

That was often used as a semantic derivation process:
* &quot;akanga&quot; &quot;head&quot;
* &quot;akangûera&quot; &quot;skull&quot; (of a skeleton)
* &quot;abá&quot; &quot;man&quot;
* &quot;abárama&quot; &quot;teenager&quot;

With respect to syntax, Tupi was mostly SOV, but word order tended to be free, as the presence of pronouns made it easy to tell the subject from the object. Nevertheless, native Tupi sentences tended to be quite short, as the Indians were not used to complex rhetorical or literary uses.

Most of the available data about Old Tupi are based on the &quot;tupinambá&quot; dialect, spoken in what is now the Brazilian state of São Paulo, but there were other dialects as well.

According to Edward Sapir&#x27;s categories, Old Tupi could be characterized as follows:

# With respect to the concepts expressed: complex, of pure relation, that is, it expresses material and relational content by means of affixes and word order, respectively.
# With respect to the manner in which such concepts are expressed: a) fusional-agglutinative, b) symbolic or of internal inflection (using reduplication of syllables, functionally differentiated).
# With respect to the degree of cohesion of the semantic elements of the sentence: synthetic.

== Sample texts ==
=== Basic phrases === 
Here are some basic phrases in Old Tupi, some of which were attested by Europeans like Jean de Léry and Yves d&#x27;Évreux during the XVI century.

*&quot;Abápe endé?&quot; (Who are you?)
*&quot;Mamõ suípe ereîur?&quot; (Where do you come from?)
*&quot;Mamõpe ereîkó?&quot; (Where do you live?)
*&quot;Marãpe nde rera?&quot; (What&#x27;s your name?)
*&quot;Tiá nde karuka!&quot; (Good afternoon!)
*&quot;Tiá nde ko&#x27;ema!&quot; (Good morning!)
*&quot;Tiá nde pytuna!&quot; (Good night!)

===Lord&#x27;s Prayer===
This is the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Tupi, according to Anchieta in his &quot;Catecismo na língua brasílica&quot;.

Notice that two Portuguese words, (Kingdom) and (temptation) have been borrowed, as such concepts would be rather difficult to express with pure Tupi words.

== Presence of Tupi in Brazil ==
As the basis for the &quot;língua geral&quot;, spoken throughout the country by white and Indian settlers alike until the early 18th century, and still heard in isolated pockets until the early 20th century, Tupi left a strong mark on the Portuguese language of Brazil.

Tupi has given the Portuguese language:
* A few thousand words (some of them hybrids or corrupted) for animals, plants, fruit and cultural entities.
* Multiple names of locations, including states (e.g. Paraná, Pará, Paraíba)

Some municipalities which have Tupi names:
* Iguaçu (&quot;&#x27;y ûasú&quot;): great river
* Ipanema (&quot;&#x27;y panema&quot;): bad, fishless water
* Itanhangá (&quot;itá + añãgá&quot;): devil&#x27;s rock
* Itaquaquecetuba (&quot;takûakesétyba&quot;, from &quot;itá + takûara + kesé + tyba&quot;): where bamboo knives are made
* Itaúna (&quot;itá + una&quot;): black rock
* Jaguariúna (&quot;îagûara + &#x27;í + una&quot;): small black jaguar
* Pacaembu (&quot;paka + embu&quot;): valley of the pacas.
* Paraíba (&quot;pará + aíba&quot;): bad to navigation or &quot;bad river&quot;
* Paranaíba (&quot;paranãíba&quot;, from &quot;paranã + aíba&quot;): dangerous sea
* Paraná-mirim (&quot;paranã + mirĩ&quot;): salty lagoon (literally: &quot;small sea&quot;)
* Pindorama (from &quot;pindó&quot;, &quot;palm tree&quot;, and &quot;(r)etama&quot; , country): palm country. Today this is used to refer to the country of Brazil, but this use (or any other referring to the whole region natives lived in) is not attested in Old Tupi.
* Piracaia (&quot;pirá&quot; + &quot;caia&quot;): fried fish
* Piraí (&quot;pirá&quot; + &quot;y&quot;): &quot;fish water&quot;
* Umuarama (&quot;ũbuarama&quot;, from &quot;ũbu + arama&quot;): where the cacti will grow

Among the many Tupi loanwords in Portuguese, the following are noteworthy for their widespread use:
* &quot;abacaxi&quot; (pineapple, literally: &quot;fruit with thorns&quot;)
* &quot;jacaré&quot; (caiman)
* &quot;mirim&quot; (small or juvenile) as in &quot;escoteiro-mirim&quot; (&quot;Boy Scout&quot;)
* &quot;perereca&quot; (a type of small frog, also slang for vulva), literally: &quot;hopper&quot;
* &quot;peteca&quot; (a type of badminton game played with bare hands) literally: &quot;slap&quot;
* &quot;piranha&quot; (a carnivorous fish, also slang for immoral women) literally: &quot;toothed fish&quot;
* &quot;pipoca&quot; (popcorn) literally &quot;explosion of skin&quot;
* &quot;piroca&quot; (originally meaning &quot;bald&quot;, now a slang term for penis)
* &quot;pororoca&quot; (a tidal phenomenon in the Amazon firth) literally: &quot;confusion&quot;
* &quot;siri&quot; (crab)
* &quot;sucuri&quot; (anaconda)
* &quot;urubu&quot; (the Brazilian vulture)
* &quot;urutu&quot; (a kind of poisonous snake)
* &quot;uruçu&quot; (the common name for &quot;Melipona scutellaris&quot;)

It is interesting, however, that two of the most distinctive Brazilian animals, the jaguar and the tapir, are best known in Portuguese by non-Tupi names, &quot;onça&quot; and &quot;anta&quot;, despite being named in English with Tupi loanwords.

A significant number of Brazilians have Tupi names as well:
* Araci (female): &quot;ara sy&quot;, &quot;mother of the day&quot;
* Bartira, Potira (female): &quot;Ybotyra&quot;, &quot;flower&quot;
* Iara (female): &quot;&#x27;y îara&quot;, lady of the lake
* Jaci (both): &quot;îasy&quot;, the moon
* Janaína (female): &quot;îandá una&quot;, a type of black bird
* Ubirajara (male): &quot;ybyrá îara&quot;, &quot;lord of the trees/lance&quot;
* Ubiratã (male): &quot;ybyrá-atã&quot;, &quot;hard wood&quot;

Some names of distinct Indian ancestry have obscure etymology because the &quot;tupinambá&quot;, like the Europeans, cherished traditional names which sometimes had become archaic. Some of such names are Moacir (reportedly meaning &quot;son of pain&quot;) and Moema.

== Literature ==

Old Tupi literature was composed mainly of religious and grammatical texts developed by Jesuit missionaries working among the colonial Brazilian people. The greatest poet to express in written Tupi language, and its first grammarian was José de Anchieta, who wrote over eighty poems and plays, compiled at his &quot;Lírica Portuguesa e Tupi&quot;. Later Brazilian authors, writing in Portuguese, employed Tupi in the speech of some of their characters.

== Recurrence ==

Tupi is also remembered as distinctive trait of nationalism in Brazil. In the 1930s, Brazilian Integralism used it as the source of most of its catchphrases (like &quot;Anaûé&quot; meaning &quot;you are my brother&quot;, the old Tupi salutation which was adopted as the Brazilian version of the German &quot;Sieg Heil&quot;, or the Roman &quot;Ave&quot;) and terminology.

<text>The Old Baptist Union is a group of evangelical Baptist churches in the United Kingdom. 

==History==
The &quot;Old Baptist Union&quot; was founded in 1880, owing largely to the labours of Henry Augustus Squire, an itinerant preacher. Currently, the &quot;Old Baptist Union&quot; has 16 member churches (in England and Wales) with about 700 members.

The churches of the &quot;Old Baptist Union&quot; are General Baptist, believing in general atonement (that in His death, Jesus atoned generally &quot;for the sins of all&quot;). They historically put more emphasis on the laying on of hands, divine healing, and personal holiness than some other Baptist affiliations.

The Union is a member of both the Free Churches Council and the Evangelical Alliance, and most of its churches are members of local geographic associations of the Baptist Union of Great Britain. Its government structure is somewhat of a combination of congregational and presbyteral, involving in each church the appointment of elders. The &quot;Old Baptist Union&#x27;s&quot; executive body is called the &quot;Council of Management,&quot; and is composed of all the ordained officers of churches holding membership in the Union. An annual general meeting is held.

<doc id="330574" wikidata="Q757000" url="?curid=330574" title="Inaccessible Island rail">
<text>The Inaccessible Island rail, or Inaccessible rail (Laterallus rogersi) is a small bird species of the rail family, Rallidae. Endemic to Inaccessible Island in the Tristan Archipelago in the isolated south Atlantic, it is the smallest extant flightless bird in the world. The species was formally described by physician Percy Lowe in 1923 but had first come to the attention of scientists 50 years earlier. The Inaccessible Island rail&#x27;s taxonomic affinities and origin were a long-standing mystery; in 2018 its closest relative was identified as the South American dot-winged crake, and it was decided that both species are best classified in the genus &quot;Laterallus&quot;.

The Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage, black bill and feet, and adults have a red eye. It occupies most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.

Unlike many other oceanic islands, Inaccessible Island has remained free from introduced predators, allowing this species to flourish while many other flightless birds, particularly flightless rails, have gone extinct. The species is nevertheless considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), due to its single small population, which would be threatened by the accidental introduction of mammalian predators such as rats or cats.

==Discovery==
Although the Inaccessible Island rail may have been known to the Tristan Islanders who visited the island annually to hunt seals, the species first came to the attention of scientists during the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition of 1872–1876. When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson learned of the species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to collect a specimen.

Another attempt was made to collect a specimen by Lord Crawford on his yacht &quot;Valhalla&quot; in 1905. A final attempt was made during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, at a meeting of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club, in 1923.

==Evolution and taxonomy==

Prior to its collection it had been assumed by Thomson that the species was close to the other &quot;island hens&quot; known in the Atlantic, possibly a gallinule, but on examination Lowe felt &quot;compelled to refer it to a new genus&quot;. The generic name &quot;Atlantisia&quot; was named for the mythical island of Atlantis, destroyed by a volcano. The specific name &quot;rogersi&quot; honours the Rev. Rogers, who collected and sent the first specimens of the species to Lowe.

In his 1928 paper on the species, Lowe thought the Inaccessible Island rail was the descendant of flightless ancestors which had reached Inaccessible Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria. Land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before the development and acceptance of plate tectonics. By 1955 it was understood that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to Inaccessible Island. It was also presumed that, like most other land birds of the Tristan Archipelago (except the Tristan moorhen &quot;Gallinula nesiotis&quot; and the Gough moorhen &quot;G. comeri&quot;), it had probably reached the island from ancestors in South America.

The position of the Inaccessible Island rail in the larger rail family (Rallidae) has long been a source of uncertainty. Lowe thought that its closest relatives may have been black crake of Africa, or perhaps an early offshoot of the genus &quot;Porphyrio&quot; (swamphens), a conclusion based mostly on similarities of plumage. He did concede that it was difficult to assign the rail to any relatives. American paleontologist Storrs Olson suggested in 1973 that it was related to the &quot;&quot;Rallus&quot; assemblage&quot;, which included the genera &quot;Rallus&quot; and &quot;Hypotaenidia&quot; (now lumped with &quot;Gallirallus&quot;), based on the structure of the skeleton. In particular he suggested it was part of a pro-&quot;Rallus&quot; group that included the Indian Ocean genus &quot;Dryolimnas&quot;, and the Australasian &quot;Lewinia&quot;. Olson suggested the pro-&quot;Rallus&quot; rails have a relict distribution and would have been present in Africa and South America, where the ancestors of the Inaccessible Island rail came from. The most recent comparative morphological study to include the genus, in 1998, placed it in a subtribe Crecina of the crakes. Its exact position could not be determined, but it was suggested to perhaps be the sister taxon to the genus &quot;Laterallus&quot;, a genus of small crakes found mostly in South America.

Two extinct flightless species of rail were at one time placed in the genus &quot;Atlantisia&quot; with the Inaccessible Island rail. The Ascension crake (&quot;Mundia elpenor&quot;) and the Saint Helena swamphen (&quot;Aphanocrex podarces&quot;) were once considered congeners of &quot;A. rogersi&quot;. The Ascension crake disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist Peter Mundy in 1656. The Saint Helena swamphen disappeared before 1600 and has never been encountered alive by scientists. In 1973 Olson synonymised the genus &quot;Aphanocrex&quot; with the genus &quot;Atlantisia&quot;, and described the Ascension crake as being congeneric. Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with &quot;A. podarces&quot; probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus &quot;Mundia&quot; was erected and the Saint Helena swamphen moved back to &quot;Aphanocrex&quot;, leaving the Inaccessible Island rail the only species in the genus &quot;Atlantisia&quot;. Both the Ascension crake and the Saint Helena swamphen became extinct due to predation by introduced species, mainly cats and rats.

Stervander &quot;et al&quot;. (2019) resolved the taxonomic affinity and evolutionary history of the Inaccessible Island rail by phylogenetic analyses of the DNA sequence of its full mitochondrial genome and a handful mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers. According to this study, the Inaccessible Island rail belongs to a clade comprising its sister species, the dot-winged crake, the black rail (&quot;Laterallus jamaicensis&quot;) in America, and most likely the Galápagos crake (&quot;Laterallus spilonota&quot;), therefore suggested referring the Inaccessible Island rail to the genus &quot;Laterallus&quot;. It colonized Inaccessible Island from South America c. 1.5 million years ago.

==Morphology==

The Inaccessible Island rail is the smallest living flightless bird in the world, measuring . Males are larger and heavier than females, weighing , average , compared to , average , in females. It is dark chestnut-brown above and dark grey on the head and below, with degraded white barring on the flanks and belly, and adults have red eyes. The female is similar to the male but with paler grey and a faint brown wash on the underparts. It has a black bill, which is shorter than the head. The feathers of the Inaccessible Island rail are almost hair-like, and in particular the flight feathers are degenerate, as the barbules on many of the feathers (but not all, as has sometimes been reported) fail to interlock, giving the feathers a ragged appearance. The wings are reduced and weak, and smaller than same-sized flying relatives, as is the sternum. The tail is short, in length, and the and are nearly as long as the tail .

The Inaccessible Island rail has a low basal metabolic rate (BMR), measured in 1989 at around 60–68% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not as a result of flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail&#x27;s island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other competitors, and as such can be expected to be at full carrying capacity for rails. This in turn would favour energy conservation by the rails, resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness. A comparison of flighted and flightless rails, including the Inaccessible Island rail, found that rails that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Inaccessible Island rail is endemic to the uninhabited Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha group in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. The island is in area and has a temperate wet oceanic climate with high rainfall, limited sunshine and persistent westerly winds. The rail is found in almost all habitats on the island and at all altitudes, from sea-level to . It reaches its highest densities in fields of tussock grass (&quot;Spartina arundinacea&quot;), with 10 birds per hectare, and in tussock grass mixed with ferns (&quot;Blechnum penna-marina&quot;) and sedges, with 15 birds per hectare. This habitat is found close to the shore and surrounds most of the island on the steep cliffs. The Inaccessible Island rail can also be found in upland fern-bush heath, dominated by wind-stunted tree-ferns (&quot;Blechnum palmiforme&quot;) and in the island forest in the central plateau which is dominated by Island Cape myrtle (&quot;Phylica arborea&quot;)—which can reach where sheltered—and &quot;Blechnum palmiforme&quot;. In both these habitats the population is estimated to be two birds per hectare. It will also forage among boulders on the beaches, but has not been found in the short dry grasses on the cinder cones (the scientists making the observations cautioned that this does not mean that they never use the habitat). It frequently uses natural cavities among boulders or tunnels through grasses created by frequent use to move around while concealed.

==Behaviour==
The Inaccessible Island rail is territorial, and the territories they defend are tiny. The territories in the tussock grass habitats around Blenden Hall, where the population densities are highest, extend to . The small size of the territories makes encounters between families and individuals frequent, and confrontations and territorial calling are common. On meeting, confrontations start with loud trills or twittering, then birds may face off, standing very close to each other and displaying ritually with their heads lowered and their bills pointed towards the ground. They may circle, and continue displaying until one bird slowly retreats or a quick skirmish ensues and one bird is driven off.

===Diet and feeding===

The foraging method used by the Inaccessible Island rail is slow and deliberate and has been compared to that of a mouse, and the bird occupies a similar ecological niche. They feed on a range of invertebrates, including earthworms, amphipods, isopods, mites and a range of insects such as beetles, flies, moths and caterpillars. Centipedes are taken as well, and an introduced species of centipede forms an important part of their diet. Along with animal prey they will take the berries of &quot;Empetrum&quot; and &quot;Nertera&quot; as well as the seeds of the dock &quot;Rumex&quot;. Unlike the Tristan thrush they do not feed on carrion or dead fish.

===Calls===
The Inaccessible Island rail is a highly vocal species, calling frequently. This may be because of the dense vegetation in which the species lives, making calls the best way to communicate, and pairs and families frequently while feeding. Calls used include a long trill used when pairs meet and when confronting a rival. Rivals also make a long twitter &quot;keekeekeekeekee&quot; which can be long and short and end in a &quot;keekeechitrrrr&quot;. After skirmishes between rivals the victorious bird may make a &quot;weechup weechup&quot; call. Birds may make a monotonous &quot;tchik tchik tchok tchik&quot; while hunting for prey, and the alarm call when predators are around is a short and hard &quot;chip&quot;. They also make a variety of trilling calls while incubating, particularly when pairs swap places during incubation. Before changing places the incubating bird may make a &quot;chip chip chip&quot;, but they fall silent when Tristan thrushes approach the nest.

===Breeding===

The Inaccessible Island rail is a seasonal breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are situated at the base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of sedges. The nests are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock grass or sedges. Where the construction material is tussock grass, larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced &quot;Malus domestica&quot; (apple) or &quot;Salix babylonica&quot; (willow).

The clutch size is two eggs, which is low for such small rails. The eggs are greyish milk white dotted with brown-rufous spots and lavender-mauve spots that are concentrated around the apex of the egg. They are large for the size of the mother compared to other rails, and resemble the eggs of the corn crake.

The incubation period for the species is not known, but both sexes incubate the clutch, although the males incubated for longer in the observations that have been made. Both sexes bring food to their partner that is incubating, which is either consumed on the nest or close to the nest. Changeovers of incubation details are preceded by &quot;chip chip chip&quot; calls, which become louder and more frequent the longer its takes the partner to respond.

The eggs hatch within between 23 and 32 hours of each other and can be preceded by the chick in the egg calling for up to 45 hours before hatching. One hatching was recorded as taking 15 hours to complete. Newly hatched chicks are covered by downy black plumage, the legs, feet and bill are black, and the mouth is silvery.

==Ecology==

Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in the absence of mammalian predators on the island, the brown skua would be the Inaccessible Island rail&#x27;s only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species, the rail and other landbirds formed only a small part of the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause of death.

Two species of chewing lice have been found on Inaccessible Island rails, &quot;Pscudomenopon scopulacorne&quot; and &quot;Rallicola (Parricola) zumpti&quot;. &quot;R. zumpti&quot; has not been described on any other species of bird from Inaccessible Island. &quot;P. scopulacorne&quot; found on the Inaccessible Island rail were originally described as a new species, &quot;P. rowani&quot; (Keler, 1951), but were later lumped into the widespread species in 1974.

==Threats and conservation==

The Inaccessible Island rail has a tiny global range with a single population. Though still common within its tiny range, with around 5,600 adult birds in the world, the species is considered to be vulnerable if an invasive species were to reach Inaccessible Island. Insular rails, particularly flightless species, are vulnerable to extinction. House mice, feral cats and brown rats, all of which would be a serious threat to this species, are not present on the island, nor have they ever been, but are present on nearby Tristan da Cunha, and could reach the islands via fishing vessels or other boats visiting the island (mice have been found on boats visiting the neighbouring Nightingale Island). Because of this vulnerability, this species is rated as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. Fires of tussock grass, which were recorded in 1872 and 1909, are assumed to have killed large numbers of rails, but have not occurred since. In the 1950s, they were highly sought after for scientific collections, but permits to do so were rarely granted.

Several conservation measures have been undertaken or proposed to protect this species. Inaccessible Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction of invasive species. However the island was declared a nature reserve by the Tristan da Cunha Island Council in 1994. Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced New Zealand flax has been removed from the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species&#x27; future include increased education on biosecurity for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached Inaccessible Island, but this may have negative impacts on the endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.

<text>The 3rd Armored Division (also known as &quot;Spearhead&quot;, 3rd Armored, and 3AD) was an armored division of the United States Army. Unofficially nicknamed the &quot;Third Herd&quot;, the division was first activated in 1941 and was active in the European Theater of World War II. The division was stationed in West Germany for much of the Cold War and also participated in the Persian Gulf War. On 17 January 1992, still in Germany, the division ceased operations. In October 1992, it was formally inactivated as part of a general drawing down of U.S. military forces at the end of the Cold War.

==World War II==

=== Composition ===
The 3rd Armored Division was organized as a &quot;heavy&quot; armored division, as was its counterpart, the 2nd Armored Division (&quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;). Later on in World War II, higher-numbered U.S. armored divisions were made smaller, with a higher ratio of armored infantry to tanks, based on lessons learned from fighting in North Africa.

As a &quot;heavy&quot; division, the 3rd Armored commanded two armored regiments containing a total of four medium tank battalions and two light tank battalions (18 companies) instead of the usual three tank battalions containing both light and heavy tanks (12 companies). The division commanded 232 medium tanks, compared to the 168 allotted to a standard light armored division, and commanded attached units numbering over 16,000 men in place of the usual 12,000 found in the light armored divisions. The 3rd Armored also commanded three armored infantry battalions.

The division&#x27;s core units were the 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, the 32nd Armored Regiment, the 33rd Armor Regiment, the 23rd Armored Engineer Battalion, the 83rd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, and the 143rd Armored Signal Company. During World War II, these units were organized into task forces known as combat commands A, B and R (Reserve).

In addition to the core units, a number of other units of various specialties were attached to the division during various operations.

The division was composed of the following units:

* Headquarters Company
* Service Company
* Combat Command A
* Combat Command B
* 32nd Armored Regiment
* 33rd Armored Regiment
* 36th Armored Infantry Regiment
* 83rd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion

===Training timeline===
The 3rd Armored was activated on 15 April 1941 at Camp Beauregard, LA. In June 1941, it moved to Camp Polk, Louisiana (now Fort Johnson). On 9 March 1942, it came under the jurisdiction of the Army Ground Forces and was assigned to the II Armored Corps. In July 1942 it was transferred to Camp Young, CA and from August to October 1942, took part in maneuvers at the Desert Training Center there. It left Camp Young in January 1943 and moved to the Indiantown Gap Military Reservation in Pennsylvania.

The division arrived in the European Theatre on 15 September 1943, conducting pre-invasion training near Liverpool and Bristol in Great Britain. It remained in Somerset, England until 24 June 1944, when it departed to partake in the Normandy operations.

===Combat service===
The first elements of the 3rd Armored saw combat on 29 June in France, with the division as a whole beginning combat operations on 9 July 1944. During this time, it was under the command of VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps First Army, but was later reassigned to the XIX Corps under the Ninth Army and the for the rest of the war.

The division was the &quot;spearhead&quot; of the First Army through the Normandy Campaign, taking part in a number of engagements, most notably in the Battle of Saint-Lô, where it suffered significant casualties. After facing heavy fighting in the hedgerows and developing methods to overcome the vast thickets of brush and earth that constrained its mobility, the unit broke out at Marigny alongside the 1st Infantry Division and swung south to Mayenne. 3rd AD engineers and maintenance crews solved the problem of the Norman hedgerows by taking the large I-Beam invasion barriers from the beaches at Normandy and welding them on the fronts of Sherman tanks as large crossing rams. They would then hit the hedgerows at high speed, bursting through them without exposing the vulnerable underbellies of the tanks.

The division was next ordered to help close the Argentan-Falaise Pocket containing the German Seventh Army, which it finished by 18 August near Putanges. Six days later, the outfit had sped through Courville and Chartres and was approaching the banks of the Seine River. On the night of 25 August 1944, the division began the crossing of the Seine; once completed, the 3rd moved across France, reaching the Belgian border on 2 September 1944.

Liberated in the path of the division were Meaux, Soissons, Laon, Marle, Mons, Charleroi, Namur and Liège. The division cut off 40,000 Wehrmacht troops at Mons and captured 8,000 prisoners. 

===Hurtgen and the Bulge===
On 10 September 1944, the 3rd, now nicknamed the &quot;Spearhead Division&quot;, fired what it claimed was the first American field artillery shell onto German soil of the war. Two days later, it passed the German border and soon breached the Siegfried Line after taking part in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.

The 3rd Armored Division fought far north of the deepest German penetration during the Battle of the Bulge. The division worked its way south in an attack designed to help wipe out the bulge and bring First Army&#x27;s line abreast of General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army, which was fighting northward toward Houffalize. It severed a vital highway leading to St. Vith and later reached Lierneux, Belgium, where it halted to refit.

===Into the German heartland===
After a month of rest, the division resumed its offensive to the east, and on 26 February, rolled back inside Germany. In the following weeks, the 3rd bolted across the Roer River and seized several towns, crossed the Erft, and at last broke through to the Rhine River to capture Cologne by 7 March. During the engagement in Cologne, a spectacular film was shot of a 3rd Division T-26E Pershing (&quot;Eagle 7&quot;) defeating a German PzKPfW V &quot;Panther&quot; that caught the Pershing by surprise in the city streets on 6 March. Two weeks later, it crossed the Rhine at Honnef, a town south of Cologne.

On 31 March, the commander of the division, Major General Maurice Rose, rounded a corner in his jeep and found himself face to face with a German tank. As he withdrew his pistol either to throw it to the ground or in an attempt to fight back, the young German tank commander, apparently misunderstanding Rose&#x27;s intentions, shot and killed the general.

After Cologne, the division swept up Paderborn in its advance to shut the back door to the Ruhr Pocket. In April, the division crossed the Saale River north of Halle and sped on toward the Elbe River.

On 11 April 1945, the 3rd Armored discovered the Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp. The division was the first to arrive on the scene, reporting back to headquarters that it had uncovered a large concentration camp near the town of Nordhausen. With help from the 104th Infantry Division, the 3rd immediately began transporting some 250 prisoners to nearby hospitals.

The division&#x27;s last major fighting in the war was the Battle of Dessau, which the division captured on 23 April 1945 after three days of combat. Following the action at Dessau, the division moved into corps reserve at Sangerhausen. Occupational duty near Langen was given to the division following V-E Day, a role it filled until inactivation on 10 November 1945.

=== Casualties ===
The 3rd Armored Division suffered the following casualties:
*Total battle casualties: 9,243
*Killed in action: 1,810
*Wounded in action: 6,963
*Missing in action: 104
*Prisoner of war: 366

=== Enemy casualties ===

*Purple Hearts – in excess of 10,500
*Air Medals – 138
*Distinguished Flying Crosses – 3

==Cold War==
The division was reactivated on 15 July 1947 at Fort Knox, Kentucky as a training formation. In 1955, the 3rd Armored Division was reorganized for combat and was shipped to Germany the next year. It replaced the 4th Infantry Division under a program called Operation Gyroscope. It was the first U.S. armored division to be stationed east of the Rhine in the Cold War. The division, headquartered at Frankfurt am Main, served in Cold War Germany for approximately 36 years, from May 1956 to July 1992, with the exception of time spent in Saudi Arabia and Iraq during the leadup to and fighting of the Gulf War. The three main combat forces headquarters for the 3rd AD were (1) Ayers Kaserne at Kirch-Goens and Schloss Kaserne at Butzbach (The forces at these Kasernes initially formed Combat Command &quot;A&quot; [CCA] of the 3rd Armored Division), (2) Coleman Kaserne at Gelnhausen (CCB/2d Brigade); and (3) Ray Barracks at Friedberg (CCC/3rd Brigade).
The most famous soldier in the division during the 1950s was Elvis Presley, who was assigned to the 1st Medium Tank Battalion, 32d Armor, at Ray Barracks. After his time in service, Presley made a movie called &quot;G.I. Blues&quot; in which he portrays a 3rd Armored Division tank crewman with little field duty but with much opportunity for singing, particularly at Frankfurt. In real life Presley was promoted to sergeant near the end of his tour in Germany without the prospect of attending the 3d Armored Division Non Commissioned Officer Academy. In the movie he wears the insignia of a specialist five rather than sergeant&#x27;s stripes.
Colin Powell also served in the division. He was assigned to the 2nd Armored Rifle Battalion, 48th Infantry, Combat Command B, Coleman Kaserne, Gelnhausen, between 1958 and 1960. His first Army command assignment was infantry platoon leader. The 3rd Armored&#x27;s primary mission between May 1956 to July 1992 was, in the event of war, to defend the Fulda Gap alongside other NATO elements and if ordered, use tactical nuclear weapons against numerically superior Warsaw Pact forces. The Division Artillery&#x27;s (DIVARTY) 333rd Field Artillery Regiment was equipped with MGM-52 Lance surface-to-surface tactical nuclear missiles in case conventional firepower was not enough to stop advancing Warsaw Pact forces if an invasion took place. USAREUR maxed out its Cold War troop strength in June 1962; that number was never achieved again. Also in June 1962, the nuclear warheads for U.S. Davy Crockett devices arrived in Europe (3rd AD combat maneuver battalions were issued Davy Crocketts). In late October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Soviet Forces, including those in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG), were placed on the highest alert level, as there was no way to communicate between Washington and Moscow. Two of the five armies in the GSFG were positioned to advance through the Fulda Gap – the 8th Guards Army, containing three motor rifle divisions and one tank division, and 1st Guards Tank Army, containing four tank divisions and one motor rifle division. From 1963 onwards, Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) changes meant organizational changes within the 3rd AD&#x27;s three combat commands and a name changeover to &quot;brigades&quot; (e.g. Combat Command A became 1st Brigade).
To prepare their soldiers for a potential invasion by the Warsaw Pact, the 3rd Armored Division&#x27;s units frequently conducted field training, including exercises of live fire, movement and communications, in Bavaria at Hohenfels Training Center, Wildflecken Training Center, and Grafenwöhr Training Center. Throughout its time in Cold War Germany, beginning in mid-1956, the division would also frequently take to the German countryside for training maneuvers, including, beginning in January 1969, what became an annually staged war game called Reforger (REturn of FORces to GERmany), which simulated an invasion of Western Europe by Warsaw Pact forces.

Throughout the Cold War, the division headquarters company, the 503rd Administrative Company, 503rd Adjutant General Company, and 503rd MP Company were based at Drake Kaserne in Frankfurt, with 143rd Signal Battalion and other support units stationed across the street at Edwards Kaserne in Frankfurt, West Germany. A number of its subunits were based in other Kasernes throughout the German state of Hessen, notably Ayers Kaserne (50° 28&#x27; 32.44&quot; N 8° 38&#x27; 29.24&quot; E) at Kirch-Goens and Schloss Kaserne at Butzbach (CCA/1st Brigade), Gelnhausen (CCB/2d Brigade), Ray Barracks at Friedberg (CCC/3rd Brigade) and Fliegerhorst near Hanau (eventually converted to the division&#x27;s Aviation Brigade base). The NCO Academy contained two companies: Co. A was assigned to the medieval castle at Usingen-Kransberg, while Co. B was located in Butzbach. The division itself was of comprised an average of 15,000 soldiers organized into three combat commands (CCs) of comparable sizes to the World War II combat commands. These brigades were manned by at least one battalion each of infantry, armor, and artillery, and various supporting units, including medical, engineer, and aviation elements.
The division was also assigned the dedicated 533rd Military Intelligence/CEWI (Combat Electronic Warfare and Intelligence) Battalion by 1980, replacing the 503rd MI Company that previously supported the division intelligence staff.

Most of the kasernes were located adjacent to or within German communities, leading to lively trade and interaction between soldiers and German civilians. A few, however, were somewhat remotely located, particularly Ayers Kaserne (&quot;The Rock&quot;)(50° 28&#x27; 32.44&quot; N 8° 38&#x27; 29.24&quot; E) outside Kirch-Goens, where the 1st Brigade was stationed. As communism in eastern Europe collapsed in the late 1980s, the two German states reunited, and the Soviet Army was beginning to withdraw back to the Soviet Union. With these events, the Cold War came to a peaceful conclusion, freeing U.S. Army units in Europe for other deployments.

Throughout the summer of 1990, in response to the winding down of the Cold War, 3AD was instructed to begin selective standing down of various division elements. Some units, for example the 3rd Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery, were turning in equipment and cross-leveling with other 3AD units when momentous events in the Middle East developed in August 1990. That month, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and soon after, President George H. W. Bush committed U.S. troops to the theater, first to defend Saudi Arabia, and then to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Deployment of advance elements of 3AD began in December, with the remaining deploying units arriving by January. Units that had drawn down were replaced or augmented back to full strength. As an example, 3–5 ADA was replaced by the 8th Infantry Division&#x27;s 5th Battalion, 3rd Air Defense Artillery. Other units were attached to 3AD to bring it up to, and even beyond, full strength.

===Deployment and retraining===

The 3rd Armored Division, then commanded by Major General Paul Funk, was one of four U.S. heavy divisions deployed with VII Corps to the Gulf Region. The division and its equipment were shifted from Germany to Saudi Arabia, with Army National Guard and Army Reserve elements taking over some of their duties in Germany, while in others, kasernes were left virtually empty. This massive deployment was made possible by the end of the Cold War.

After deployment, the division acclimated to the desert climate, and its troops faced new challenges in mobility, tactics and maintenance in a sandy and hot climate. Various National Guard and Army Reserve units were attached to the division for the duration of the conflict, swelling the division&#x27;s size to over 20,000 troops – 25% larger than during its time in Germany.

The majority of the division&#x27;s troops never received Desert Battle Dress Uniforms due to equipment shortages, and fought instead in lightweight summer &quot;woodland pattern&quot; uniforms covered by tanker suits or chemical warfare protective MOPP suits.

===Into battle===
After months of training, the division moved to the line of departure, with the 1st Armored Division on its left flank and the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment on its right flank. While the Iraqi Army concentrated much of its defenses in and around Kuwait itself, the 3rd AD and VII Corps launched a massive armored attack into Iraq, just to the west of Kuwait, taking the Iraqis completely by surprise. 

Scouts from 2nd Brigade crossed the border on the afternoon of 23 February 1991 just after 1500 hours. Less than two hours later, they had penetrated several miles into Iraq and managed to capture over 200 prisoners. On 24 February, the official first day of action, the division as a whole swung into action as part of a coordinated attack by hundreds of thousands of Coalition troops. By dawn on the second day, an additional 50 prisoners had been taken, with scouts reporting enemy reinforcements moving to meet the division.

===Second day===
At 1115 hours on the second day of the invasion, all elements of the division finally moved across the line of departure. The day was marked by hard pushing to penetrate deep and fast for an objective south of Basra. In the course of its drive, various elements of 3AD engaged the enemy, taking prisoners, skirmishing, sometimes bypassing enemy strongholds to gain ground, and other times engaging in full-scale battle. 

By nightfall of the second day, 3AD had driven 53 miles into Iraq, with dozens of enemy vehicles destroyed, hundreds of POWs captured, and was on the verge of achieving its first objective – an accomplishment that war planners had not anticipated.

===Third day===
On the third day of combat, 26 February, the division closed in on its objective and faced for the first time the Iraqi Republican Guard, a much stronger foe than the conscripts the division had first engaged, and less inclined to retreat or surrender. Opposing forces included the highly touted Republican Guard &quot;Tawakalna&quot; Division, the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division and elements of the 17th and the 10th Armored Divisions. The division engaged in full scale tank battles for the first time since World War II, with one of the division&#x27;s veterans stating &quot;there was more than enough action for everyone&quot;.

Action continued after nightfall, and by 1840 hours, the ground and air elements of the 3rd AD reported over 20 tanks, 14 APCs, several trucks and some artillery pieces destroyed. That same evening, the 4th Battalion, 32nd Armor lost the division&#x27;s first casualties, with two soldiers killed and three wounded to 25mm cannon fire and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle they were in destroyed. During the night, both darkness and sandstorms hampered soldiers&#x27; visibility, but thermal sighting systems onboard the M1A1 Abrams tanks and Bradleys allowed gunners to continue to knock out Iraqi targets.

===Fourth and fifth days===
By the fourth day, the division had reached its objective and was pursuing its now retreating enemy. The division turned east into Kuwait, continuing to inflict heavy casualties and capture troops as it rolled forward, often hitting Iraqi units whose defensive berms and foxholes faced south from their northern flank, rendering their defenses ineffective. By nightfall, forces facing 3AD had been virtually eliminated, with their remnants in full retreat.

By the fifth day of combat, 28 February, the division had achieved all of its original objectives. It had cleared Objective Dorset after meeting stiff resistance and destroying more than 300 enemy vehicles. The 3rd Brigade, 3AD had also captured 2,500 enemy prisoners. The division was now pushing east to block the Iraqi retreat from Kuwait and conduct mopping up operations. Less than one hundred hours after the ground campaign started, President Bush declared a ceasefire.

===Gulf War legacy===

At the height of the war, the 3rd Armored Division commanded 32 battalions and 20,533 personnel. The 3rd Armored Division was the largest coalition division in the Gulf War and the largest U.S. armored division in history. In its arsenal were 360 Abrams main battle tanks, 340 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 128 self-propelled 155 mm howitzers, 27 Apache attack helicopters, 9 multiple-launch rocket systems, and additional equipment.

The 3rd AD served at the Battle of 73 Easting and the Battle of Norfolk. Only three of its M1A1 Abrams tanks were damaged during combat operations. The 3rd Armored Division suffered 15 soldiers killed between December 1990 and late February 1991. Seven soldiers were killed in action and another 27 were wounded during combat operations.

In 1991, Division Historian Dan Peterson, comparing the performance of the division in World War II and Desert Storm, stated, &quot;History does always repeat itself. 3rd Armored Division was the Spearhead in both wars.&quot;

Following the war, 3rd Armored Division was one of the first units rotated to Camp Doha, Kuwait, providing protection to Kuwait as the country was rebuilt.

==Inactivation==
Following Desert Storm, a number of the division&#x27;s units were transferred to the 1st Armored Division.

On 17 January 1992, the 3rd Armored Division officially ceased operations in Germany with a ceremony held in Frankfurt at Division Headquarters Drake Kaserne.

&quot;Sir, this is my final salute. Mission accomplished,&quot; said Maj. Gen. Jerry Rutherford, the division commander. Rutherford preceded the final salute to General Crosbie E. Saint, USAREUR Commander, with a loudly shouted &quot;Spearhead!&quot;. The division colors were then returned to the United States with the 3rd AD still officially active, since Army regulations state that a Divisional &quot;Casing of the Colors&quot; cannot occur on foreign soil.

Official Inactivation took place at Fort Knox, on 17 October 1992. In attendance at the ceremony were several former Spearhead commanding generals and division veterans from all eras. In a traditional ceremony, Command Sgt. Major Richard L. Ross, holding the division color with battle streamers, passed it to General Frederick M. Franks, Jr., completing the official inactivation of the division. With this ceremony, the 3rd Armored Division was removed from the active duty force structure of the U.S. Army.

==Reassignment==
With the end of the Cold War, several of the division&#x27;s overseas Kasernes were transferred to other units, particularly the 1st Armored Division. Over time, many were closed, fell into disrepair, or were demolished. Some 3rd Armored units were transferred to the 1st Armored, notably the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery, later portrayed in &quot;Gunner Palace&quot;.

The 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor was reflagged and is now stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky as part of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). The unit was reorganized as the 1st Squadron, 32nd Cavalry Regiment, and is assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) as its organic reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) element. The 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor was also reflagged and stationed at Fort Campbell with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) as the 1st Squadron, 33rd Cavalry Regiment, and is assigned to the Division&#x27;s 3rd Brigade Combat Team. The 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry later became part of 1st Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. It was inactivated on 2 July 2015.

The following 3AD units were assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division:

*1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry
*2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry
*3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry
*2nd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery
*2nd Battalion, 227th Aviation
*3rd Battalion, 227th Aviation

Additionally, the 122nd Support Battalion (Main) from the Division Support Command was reactivated at Fort Bragg and assigned to the Combat Aviation Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division as the 122nd Support Battalion (Aviation). The 54th Support Battalion (Main) was reactivated on 16 September 1994 as the 54th Support Battalion (Base) of the 80th Support Group (Area).

==Commanders==
The 3rd Armored Division had thirty-nine commanders over the course of its history, many of whom went on to obtain four star rank.

<doc id="330593" wikidata="Q1525305" url="?curid=330593" title="Giordano Bruno (crater)">
<text>Giordano Bruno is a lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the northeastern limb. It lies in an area that can be viewed during a favorable libration, although the area is viewed from the side and not much detail can be seen. It lies between the craters Harkhebi to the northwest and Szilard to the southeast.

When viewed from orbit, Giordano Bruno is at the center of a symmetrical ray system of ejecta that has a higher albedo than the surrounding surface. The ray material extends for over and has not been significantly darkened by space erosion. Some of the ejecta appear to extend as far as the crater Boss, over to the northwest. The outer rim of the crater is especially bright compared to its surroundings. To all appearances, this is a young formation that was created in the relatively recent past, geologically speaking. Based on photos from a lunar orbiter, the crater&#x27;s age has been estimated at 4 million years.

This feature was named after Italian intellectual Giordano Bruno by the IAU in 1961.

== Formation ==

Five witnesses from Canterbury reported to the abbey&#x27;s chronicler, Gervase, that shortly after sunset on 18 June 1178, they saw &quot;the upper horn [of the moon] split in two&quot;. Furthermore, Gervase writes:

In 1976, the geologist Jack B. Hartung proposed that this described the formation of the crater Giordano Bruno.

Modern theories predict that a (conjectural) asteroid or comet impact on the Moon would create a plume of ejecta rising up from the surface, which is consistent with the monks&#x27; description. The impact would be expected to perturb the Moon&#x27;s motions, and laser rangefinding measurements of its libration in longitude were judged to be of the expected magnitude for such an event. In addition, the location recorded fits in well with the crater&#x27;s location. Additional evidence of Giordano Bruno&#x27;s youth is its spectacular ray system. The ratio of the length of these rays to the diameter of the crater is the largest for a large crater on the Moon, suggesting it is the youngest such crater. Because micrometeorites constantly rain down, they kick up enough dust to quickly (in geological terms) erode a ray system.

However, these observations do not resolve the question of the crater&#x27;s age. The expected odds of formation of a lunar crater of that size in the last 3,000 years are on the order of 0.1%. The impact creating the 22-km-wide crater would have kicked up of debris, triggering a week-long, blizzard-like meteor storm on Earth – yet no accounts of such a noteworthy storm of unprecedented intensity are found in any known historical records, including the European, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese and Korean astronomical archives. This discrepancy is a major objection to the theory that Giordano Bruno was formed at that time. Also, much older craters, e.g., Tycho at 108 million years and Copernicus at an estimated 800 million years, still have prominent ray systems.

High-resolution images obtained by the Japanese satellite SELENE in 2008 were used to date the crater by counting the smaller craters within it and its ejecta deposits. This gave an age of million years, much too old for the hypothesis. Further scientific studies have strengthened this age.

This raises the question of what the monks saw. An alternative theory holds that the monks just happened to be in the right place at the right time to see an exploding meteor coming at them and aligned with the Moon. This would explain why the monks were the only people known to have witnessed the event; such an alignment would only be observable from a specific spot on the Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Ejected asteroid ==

In 2021, the asteroid 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, which is a quasi-satellite of Earth (orbiting the Sun with the same period and phase as the Earth, appearing to orbit the Earth when viewed from there) was found to have a chemical composition similar to that of the lunar surface. After limiting crater size based on simulations of impacts that could eject a piece this large into a quasi-satellite orbit, and limiting crater age to between 1 and 10 million years based on the instability of the asteroid&#x27;s orbit, a 2024 study found that the most likely origin is the Giordano Bruno crater.

<text>Richard &quot;Ric&quot; Berger (1894–1984) was a Swiss professor of design, decoration, and art history. He is best known for his numerous newspaper articles about historical monuments, mainly in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, including his own drawings of the buildings. Through these articles, he contributed to an increased interest in historical monuments and settings among many hitherto uninformed people, and probably also contributed indirectly to a wider interest in preserving and saving historical monuments from destruction.

Around the early 1970s, he published samples of his newspaper writings in books that were, and still are, prized by amateur historians and archeologists. He is read with more caution in university circles, being known as a &quot;vulgarizer&quot; and reflecting essentially the state of knowledge at the period of his publications, chiefly the 1950s. Being an active teacher as well, he wrote papers on heraldry, on the history of the alphabet and on the drawing habits of children.

== International auxiliary language activities ==
Ric Berger spent the majority of his life involved with international auxiliary languages, supporting four over the course of his life. Berger was an extremely active proponent of whichever language he supported at the time, while tending to heavily criticize others, including languages he had previously supported. 

=== Esperanto ===
In 1912, at the age of 18, he became interested in universal languages as an Esperantist. 

=== Ido ===
Berger began to support Ido in 1918 after six years with Esperanto. 

=== Occidental (later Interlingue) ===
Berger&#x27;s activities with Occidental began in 1928, when he became the editor of the magazine &quot;Svissia&quot; (known as &quot;Helvetia&quot; from 1929) which continued publication until 1933. Immediately after leaving Ido he began a fierce campaign to promote Occidental and criticize Ido in its stead, often writing multiple articles for Cosmoglotta and often devoting nearly entire issues to criticisms of Ido. 

He was co-editor of the Occidental magazine &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; from 1934 to 1950. In 1945 he began considering changing the name of the language, proposing the possible names &quot;Auli&quot; and &quot;Wahl&quot;. He eventually succeeded in changing the name of the language to &quot;Interlingue&quot; in 1949. 

=== Interlingua ===
Ric Berger officially became interested in Interlingua in 1956, the last auxiliary language he worked for. From January 1959 to December 1963, Berger was secretary general of the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI) and editor of the Interlingua magazine &quot;Currero&quot;. He authored more than 20 books about art and historic monuments in Switzerland and a large number of thematic notebooks in Interlingua, especially on the history of international auxiliary languages. He edited the &quot;Revista de Interlingua&quot;, which ceased with his death, from 1966 to 1983. This magazine grew to more than 6,000 pages sent to 60 countries. As head of his own publishing firm, Editiones Interlingua, he published Interlingua manuals in several languages, ensuring that manuals in the &quot;minor languages&quot; were included. 
&quot;Europe is divided by the walls of 30 languages. Happily, among these national languages, about 10,000 words of Greek and Latin origin are common. This precious linguistic treasure should be used to the utmost without mutilating a single word or inventing others.&quot;

<doc id="330599" wikidata="Q724334" url="?curid=330599" title="Felipe Carrillo Puerto">
<text>Felipe Santiago Carrillo Puerto (8 November 1874 – 3 January 1924) was a Mexican journalist, politician and revolutionary who served as the governor of Yucatán from 1922 until his assassination in 1924. He became known for his efforts at reconciliation between the Yucatec Maya and the Mexican government after the Caste War.

==Prerevolution and personal life==
Carrillo Puerto was born in the town of Motul, Yucatán, 45 km northeast of Mérida, and was of partly indigenous Maya background; he was rumored to be a descendant of the Nachi Cocom dynasty of Mayapan. His parents were the merchant Justiniano Carrillo Pasos and his wife Adelaide Puerto Solis. He was one of fourteen children, thirteen of whom lived into adulthood. Although his family were Spanish speakers, he also grew up speaking Maya (Mayathan), the language of the neighborhood children.

He was a socialist who favored land reform, women&#x27;s suffrage, and rights for the indigenous Maya people. As a teenager during the Caste War, he was briefly imprisoned for urging the Maya people to tear down a fence that had been built by the large landowners around lands in the community of Dzununcán to keep the Maya out. He obtained work on the local railways (known as tramways), joined the railway workers union, and married Isabel Palma.

Carrillo Puerto then began publishing and editing &quot;El Heraldo de Motul&quot;, which was briefly closed down in 1907 by the authorities for &quot;insulting public officials&quot;. In the Yucatán gubernatorial election of 1909, Carrillo Puerto supported the candidacy of the poet Delio Moreno Cantón in the three-way race against the Antirreeleccionista Party&#x27;s (Maderista&#x27;s) José María Pino Suárez, and the pro-Díaz Enrique Muñoz Arístegui. Arístegui was announced as the winner in what is generally considered to have been a fraudulent tally. In 1910 he attended the Third Congress of the Associated Press of the States (Congreso de la Prensa Asociada de los Estados) in Mexico City and spearheaded a resolution to free the political prisoners being held at San Juan de Ulúa; a resolution that President Díaz acceded to. In 1912, he went to work as a reporter and columnist for the periodical Revista de Mérida run by his friend and colleague Carlos R. Menéndez.

He married María Isabel Palma in 1901. They had six children. In 1923, he had a romance with a United States journalist, Alma Reed of San Francisco, California, which was commemorated in the song commissioned by him: &quot;Peregrina&quot;, written by the poet Luis Rosado de la Vega and the composer Ricardo Palmerín.

==As governor==
Carrillo Puerto&#x27;s candidacy for governor was supported by the (). On 1 February 1922, Carrillo Puerto took the oath of office and made his first speech as governor, and did so in the Maya language. He promised to respect and enforce the Federal Constitution, as well as the resolutions adopted by the Workers&#x27; Congress of Motul and Izamal. He proclaimed the &quot;first socialist government in the Americas&quot;. During his 20 months as governor, Carrillo Puerto initiated land reform, confiscating large estates and returning land to the native Maya. He promoted new farming techniques, granted women political rights, began family planning programs, fought against alcoholism, and fought for the conservation and restoration of the pre-Columbian Maya archaeological sites. In the first year of his administration 417 public schools were opened.

On 25 February 1922 he founded the Universidad Nacional del Sureste, now called the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán (UADY).

Carrillo Puerto was not a supporter of the Adolfo de la Huerta rebellion against President Álvaro Obregón, and General Plutarco Elías Calles. As a result, he was captured by rebel army officers, tried by a military tribunal, and executed by a firing squad on 3 January 1924, along with three of his brothers, Wilfrido, Benjamin, and Edesio, and eight of their friends.

==Legacy==
Felipe Carrillo Puerto was called the &quot;Red Dragon with the Eyes of Jade&quot; (&quot;El Dragón Rojo de los Ojos de Jade&quot;) by his enemies and the &quot;Apostle of the Bronze Race&quot; (&quot;Apóstol de la raza de bronce&quot;) by those who loved him.

The movie &quot;Peregrina&quot; regarding his life was made in 1974 starring Antonio Aguilar. The towns of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Nayarit, Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo (formerly Santa Cruz de Bravo), Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Michoacan, Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Oaxaca and Motul de Carrillo Puerto were named in his honor.

Tulum International Airport was named after him and started operations on December 1, 2023. During the inauguration, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared that 2024 would be the &quot;year of Felipe Carrillo Puerto&quot; (). López Obrador later formally submitted this proposal to congress, and it entered into force on 1 January 2024.

<doc id="330603" wikidata="Q3825524" url="?curid=330603" title="Disc integration">
<text>Disc integration, also known in integral calculus as the disc method, is a method for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution of a solid-state material when integrating along an axis &quot;parallel&quot; to the axis of revolution. This method models the resulting three-dimensional shape as a stack of an infinite number of discs of varying radius and infinitesimal thickness. It is also possible to use the same principles with rings instead of discs (the &quot;washer method&quot;) to obtain hollow solids of revolutions. This is in contrast to shell integration, which integrates along an axis &quot;perpendicular&quot; to the axis of revolution.

==Definition==
===Function of ===
If the function to be revolved is a function of , the following integral represents the volume of the solid of revolution:

:formula_1

where is the distance between the function and the axis of rotation. This works only if the axis of rotation is horizontal (example: or some other constant).

===Function of ===
If the function to be revolved is a function of , the following integral will obtain the volume of the solid of revolution:

:formula_2

where is the distance between the function and the axis of rotation. This works only if the axis of rotation is vertical (example: or some other constant).

===Washer method===
To obtain a hollow solid of revolution (the “washer method”), the procedure would be to take the volume of the inner solid of revolution and subtract it from the volume of the outer solid of revolution. This can be calculated in a single integral similar to the following:

:formula_3

where is the function that is farthest from the axis of rotation and is the function that is closest to the axis of rotation. For example, the next figure shows the rotation along the -axis of the red &quot;leaf&quot; enclosed between the square-root and quadratic curves: 

The volume of this solid is:
:formula_4

One should take caution not to evaluate the square of the difference of the two functions, but to evaluate the difference of the squares of the two functions.

:formula_5

(This formula only works for revolutions about the -axis.)

To rotate about any horizontal axis, simply subtract from that axis from each formula. If is the value of a horizontal axis, then the volume equals

:formula_6

For example, to rotate the region between and along the axis , one would integrate as follows:

:formula_7

The bounds of integration are the zeros of the first equation minus the second. Note that when integrating along an axis other than the , the graph of the function that is farthest from the axis of rotation may not be that obvious. In the previous example, even though the graph of is, with respect to the x-axis, further up than the graph of , with respect to the axis of rotation the function is the inner function: its graph is closer to or the equation of the axis of rotation in the example.

The same idea can be applied to both the -axis and any other vertical axis. One simply must solve each equation for before one inserts them into the integration formula.

<doc id="330604" wikidata="Q1945014" url="?curid=330604" title="Monoidal category">
<text>In mathematics, a monoidal category (or tensor category) is a category formula_1 equipped with a bifunctor
:formula_2
that is associative up to a natural isomorphism, and an object &quot;I&quot; that is both a left and right identity for ⊗, again up to a natural isomorphism. The associated natural isomorphisms are subject to certain coherence conditions, which ensure that all the relevant diagrams commute.

The ordinary tensor product makes vector spaces, abelian groups, &quot;R&quot;-modules, or &quot;R&quot;-algebras into monoidal categories. Monoidal categories can be seen as a generalization of these and other examples. Every (small) monoidal category may also be viewed as a &quot;categorification&quot; of an underlying monoid, namely the monoid whose elements are the isomorphism classes of the category&#x27;s objects and whose binary operation is given by the category&#x27;s tensor product.

A rather different application, for which monoidal categories can be considered an abstraction, is a system of data types closed under a type constructor that takes two types and builds an aggregate type. The types serve as the objects, and ⊗ is the aggregate constructor. The associativity up to isomorphism is then a way of expressing that different ways of aggregating the same data—such as formula_3 and formula_4—store the same information even though the aggregate values need not be the same. The aggregate type may be analogous to the operation of addition (type sum) or of multiplication (type product). For type product, the identity object is the unit formula_5, so there is only one inhabitant of the type, and that is why a product with it is always isomorphic to the other operand. For type sum, the identity object is the void type, which stores no information, and it is impossible to address an inhabitant. The concept of monoidal category does not presume that values of such aggregate types can be taken apart; on the contrary, it provides a framework that unifies classical and quantum information theory.

In category theory, monoidal categories can be used to define the concept of a monoid object and an associated action on the objects of the category. They are also used in the definition of an enriched category.

Monoidal categories have numerous applications outside of category theory proper. They are used to define models for the multiplicative fragment of intuitionistic linear logic. They also form the mathematical foundation for the topological order in condensed matter physics. Braided monoidal categories have applications in quantum information, quantum field theory, and string theory.

==Formal definition==

A monoidal category is a category formula_1 equipped with a monoidal structure. A monoidal structure consists of the following:
*a bifunctor formula_7 called the &quot;monoidal product&quot;, or &quot;tensor product&quot;,
*an object formula_8 called the &quot;monoidal unit&quot;, &quot;unit object&quot;, or &quot;identity object&quot;,
*three natural isomorphisms subject to certain coherence conditions expressing the fact that the tensor operation:
**is associative: there is a natural (in each of three arguments formula_9, formula_10, formula_11) isomorphism formula_12, called &quot;associator&quot;, with components formula_13,
**has formula_8 as left and right identity: there are two natural isomorphisms formula_15 and formula_16, respectively called &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right unitor&quot;, with components formula_17 and formula_18.

Note that a good way to remember how formula_19 and formula_16 act is by alliteration; &quot;Lambda&quot;, formula_15, cancels the identity on the &quot;left&quot;, while &quot;Rho&quot;, formula_16, cancels the identity on the &quot;right&quot;.

The coherence conditions for these natural transformations are: 
* for all formula_9, formula_10, formula_11 and formula_26 in formula_1, the pentagon diagram
: commutes;
* for all formula_9 and formula_10 in formula_1, the triangle diagram

: commutes.

A strict monoidal category is one for which the natural isomorphisms &quot;α&quot;, &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;ρ&quot; are identities. Every monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict monoidal category.
==Examples==

*Any category with finite products can be regarded as monoidal with the product as the monoidal product and the terminal object as the unit. Such a category is sometimes called a cartesian monoidal category. For example:
**Set, the category of sets with the Cartesian product, any particular one-element set serving as the unit.
**Cat, the category of small categories with the product category, where the category with one object and only its identity map is the unit.
*Dually, any category with finite coproducts is monoidal with the coproduct as the monoidal product and the initial object as the unit. Such a monoidal category is called cocartesian monoidal
*&quot;R&quot;-Mod, the category of modules over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, is a monoidal category with the tensor product of modules ⊗&quot;R&quot; serving as the monoidal product and the ring &quot;R&quot; (thought of as a module over itself) serving as the unit. As special cases one has: 
**&quot;K&quot;-Vect, the category of vector spaces over a field &quot;K&quot;, with the one-dimensional vector space &quot;K&quot; serving as the unit.
**Ab, the category of abelian groups, with the group of integers Z serving as the unit.
*For any commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, the category of &quot;R&quot;-algebras is monoidal with the tensor product of algebras as the product and &quot;R&quot; as the unit. 
*The category of pointed spaces (restricted to compactly generated spaces for example) is monoidal with the smash product serving as the product and the pointed 0-sphere (a two-point discrete space) serving as the unit.
*The category of all endofunctors on a category C is a &quot;strict&quot; monoidal category with the composition of functors as the product and the identity functor as the unit.
*Just like for any category E, the full subcategory spanned by any given object is a monoid, it is the case that for any 2-category E, and any object C in Ob(E), the full 2-subcategory of E spanned by {C} is a monoidal category. In the case E = Cat, we get the endofunctors example above. 
* Bounded-above meet semilattices are strict symmetric monoidal categories: the product is meet and the identity is the top element.
* Any ordinary monoid formula_31 is a small monoidal category with object set formula_32, only identities for morphisms, formula_33 as tensor product and formula_34 as its identity object. Conversely, the set of isomorphism classes (if such a thing makes sense) of a monoidal category is a monoid w.r.t. the tensor product.
* Any commutative monoid formula_35 can be realized as a monoidal category with a single object. Recall that a category with a single object is the same thing as an ordinary monoid. By an Eckmann-Hilton argument, adding another monoidal product on formula_32 requires the product to be commutative. 

== Properties and associated notions ==
It follows from the three defining coherence conditions that &quot;a large class&quot; of diagrams (i.e. diagrams whose morphisms are built using formula_12, formula_15, formula_16, identities and tensor product) commute: this is Mac Lane&#x27;s &quot;coherence theorem&quot;. It is sometimes inaccurately stated that &quot;all&quot; such diagrams commute.

There is a general notion of monoid object in a monoidal category, which generalizes the ordinary notion of monoid from abstract algebra. Ordinary monoids are precisely the monoid objects in the cartesian monoidal category Set. Further, any (small) strict monoidal category can be seen as a monoid object in the category of categories Cat (equipped with the monoidal structure induced by the cartesian product).

Monoidal functors are the functors between monoidal categories that preserve the tensor product and monoidal natural transformations are the natural transformations, between those functors, which are &quot;compatible&quot; with the tensor product.

Every monoidal category can be seen as the category B(∗, ∗) of a bicategory B with only one object, denoted ∗.

The concept of a category C enriched in a monoidal category M replaces the notion of a set of morphisms between pairs of objects in C with the notion of an M-object of morphisms between every two objects in C.

=== Free strict monoidal category ===

For every category C, the free strict monoidal category Σ(C) can be constructed as follows:
* its objects are lists (finite sequences) &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; of objects of C;
* there are arrows between two objects &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;m&quot; and &quot;B&quot;1, ..., &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; only if &quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot;, and then the arrows are lists (finite sequences) of arrows &quot;f&quot;1: &quot;A&quot;1 → &quot;B&quot;1, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;: &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; → &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; of C;
* the tensor product of two objects &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; and &quot;B&quot;1, ..., &quot;B&quot;&quot;m&quot; is the concatenation &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;B&quot;1, ..., &quot;B&quot;&quot;m&quot; of the two lists, and, similarly, the tensor product of two morphisms is given by the concatenation of lists. The identity object is the empty list.
This operation Σ mapping category C to Σ(C) can be extended to a strict 2-monad on Cat.

== Specializations ==
* If, in a monoidal category, formula_40 and formula_41 are naturally isomorphic in a manner compatible with the coherence conditions, we speak of a braided monoidal category. If, moreover, this natural isomorphism is its own inverse, we have a symmetric monoidal category.
* A closed monoidal category is a monoidal category where the functor formula_42 has a right adjoint, which is called the &quot;internal Hom-functor&quot; formula_43. Examples include cartesian closed categories such as Set, the category of sets, and compact closed categories such as FdVect, the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces.
* Autonomous categories (or compact closed categories or rigid categories) are monoidal categories in which duals with nice properties exist; they abstract the idea of FdVect.
* Dagger symmetric monoidal categories, equipped with an extra dagger functor, abstracting the idea of FdHilb, finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These include the dagger compact categories.
* Tannakian categories are monoidal categories enriched over a field, which are very similar to representation categories of linear algebraic groups.

===Preordered monoids===
A preordered monoid is a monoidal category in which for every two objects formula_44, there exists &quot;at most one&quot; morphism formula_45 in C. In the context of preorders, a morphism formula_45 is sometimes notated formula_47. The reflexivity and transitivity properties of an order, defined in the traditional sense, are incorporated into the categorical structure by the identity morphism and the composition formula in C, respectively. If formula_48 and formula_49, then the objects formula_50 are isomorphic which is notated formula_51.

Introducing a monoidal structure to the preorder C involves constructing
* an object formula_52, called the &quot;monoidal unit&quot;, and 
* a functor formula_53, denoted by &quot;formula_54&quot;, called the &quot;monoidal multiplication&quot;.
formula_8 and formula_33 must be unital and associative, up to isomorphism, meaning: 
: formula_57 and formula_58.
As · is a functor, 
:if formula_59 and formula_60 then formula_61.
The other coherence conditions of monoidal categories are fulfilled through the preorder structure as every diagram commutes in a preorder.

The natural numbers are an example of a monoidal preorder: having both a monoid structure (using + and 0) and a preorder structure (using ≤) forms a monoidal preorder as formula_62 and formula_63 implies formula_64. 

The free monoid on some generating set produces a monoidal preorder, producing the semi-Thue system.

<text>Playa del Carmen, known colloquially as Playa, is a resort city located along the Caribbean Sea in the southeastern state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. It is part of the municipality of Solidaridad. As of 2020, the city&#x27;s population was just over 300,000 people during 2020, a small yet thriving portion of which are foreign immigrants.

Playa del Carmen is a popular tourist destination in Mexico&#x27;s Riviera Maya region. Its current growth rate is set at 7.5% per year. According to Guinness World Records, it is one of Latin America&#x27;s fastest-growing communities. In 2016, the city was the tenth most popular international travel destination for U.S. travelers, and more than one million tourists passed through the city a year later. The main airport for Playa is the Cancún International Airport, which is around away.

The area is known for its white sand beaches, blue turquoise waters, coral reefs, surrounding rainforests, and balnearios. The downtown area of the city revolves around , a busy pedestrian thoroughfare lined with many shops, clubs, and restaurants. The weather is hot year-round. The summer and winter breaks are peak season for tourism.

==Geography==

Playa del Carmen is located within the Riviera Maya, which runs from south of Cancún to Tulum and the Sian Ka&#x27;an biosphere reserve. Playa is a stop for several cruise ships which dock at the nearby Calica quarry docks, about six miles (10 km) south of the city. The Xcaret Eco Park, a Mexican-themed &quot;eco-archaeological park&quot;, is just south of the town in Xcaret (pronounced &quot;ish-kar-et&quot;).

=== Climate ===

In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma passed directly over Playa del Carmen, remaining in the vicinity for two days and causing significant damage and a temporary drop in tourist arrivals. Most of the damage was relatively superficial and repaired within a few weeks of the storm. Hurricane Wilma arrived from the Caribbean Sea, passing over Cozumel before making landfall in Playa del Carmen. It then moved north along the Mexican coast, hitting Cancún especially hard.

Playa del Carmen has a tropical savannah climate (Aw) with June to November receiving most of the precipitation. Summers are hot and year-round with warm nights.

== Demographics ==

== Tourism ==
Originally a small fishing town, tourism to Playa del Carmen began with the passenger ferry service to Cozumel, an island across the Cozumel Channel and a scuba diving destination.

== Safety ==
Playa del Carmen is generally a safe travel destination in Mexico. The town is generally secure for most tourists, except for risks such as hurricanes, sunburns, and common tourist scams. &quot;Numbeo&quot; reports that both the Safety Index and Crime Index in Playa del Carmen are in the low-moderate range, with scores of 50.55 and 49.45, respectively.

== Sports ==

The city is home to Inter Playa del Carmen, an association football club founded in 1999. It competes in the south group of the Segunda División Profesional, the third tier of Mexican football league system.

The World Wide Technology Championship at Mayakoba is a PGA Tour FedEx Cup golf tournament that was held at El Camaleón Golf Club between 2007 and 2023. Since 2013, it has been a full-points tournament where the winner earns full rights for a PGA TOUR win.

== In popular culture ==
Numerous TV series have been filmed and set in Playa del Carmen. The telenovela &quot;Peregrina&quot; takes place in Playa del Carmen. The Canadian &quot;Real Housewives of Vancouver&quot; featured Playa del Carmen in two episodes. The US series &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; was shot on location in Playa del Carmen, and &quot;The Celebrity Mole&quot; was set in that area.

<text>Rockport is a seaside town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 6,992 in 2020. Rockport is located approximately northeast of Boston, at the tip of the Cape Ann peninsula. Rockport borders Gloucester to its west, and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean in all other directions.

Part of the town comprises the census-designated place of Rockport.

==History==

Before the coming of the English explorers and colonists, Cape Ann was home to a number of Native American villages, inhabited by members of the Agawam tribe. Samuel de Champlain named the peninsula &quot;Cap Aux Isles&quot; in 1605, and his expedition may have landed there briefly. The first Europeans founded a permanent settlement at Gloucester in 1623. 

Richard Tarr, a granite cutter and the first settler of the Sandy Bay Colony, lived in the area that is now Rockport in 1680. He and his wife Elizabeth had ten children, those born after 1690 were recorded in the Sandy Bay Colony record books. Richard died around the year 1732. The area provided timber for shipbuilding, especially pine, and granite was extracted from the Sandy Bay quarries. The Cape Ann area provided one of the richest fishing grounds in New England and in 1743 a dock was built at Rockport harbor on Sandy Bay and was used for both timber export and fishing. By the beginning of the 19th century, the first granite quarries were developed and, by the 1830s, Rockport granite was being shipped to cities and towns throughout the east coast of the United States.

Rockport had consisted primarily of large estates, summer homes, and a small fishing village while Gloucester was becoming increasingly urbanized. Rockport was set off as a separate town in 1840 as its residents desired a separate enclave with an identity of its own, and was incorporated in 1840. As the demand for its high-grade granite grew during the Industrial Revolution, the quarries of Rockport became a major source of the stone. A distinctive form of sloop was even developed to transport the granite to parts far and wide until the second decade of the 20th century. For many years, there was a large number of residents of Scandinavian descent, dating from the days when Finnish and Swedish immigrants with stone-working expertise made up a large part of the workforce at the quarries.

Although the demand for granite decreased with the increased use of concrete in construction during the Great Depression, Rockport still thrived as an artists colony—which began years earlier due in part to its popularity as a vacation spot known for its rocky, boulder-strewn ocean beaches, its history as a prominent fishing harbor, and its mentions in media like that of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;. A red fishing shack on Bradley Wharf in Rockport, known popularly as &quot;Motif Number 1&quot;, has for years been one of the most famous sites on Cape Ann as the subject of hundreds of paintings and photographs, and is visited by aspiring artists &amp; tourists alike from all over the world. Rockport is the home of the Rockport Art Association.

In 1856, a gang of 200 women led by Hannah Jumper swept through the town and destroyed anything containing alcohol in what is called &quot;Rockport&#x27;s revolt against rum&quot; and banned alcohol from the town. Except for a period in the 1930s, the town remained one of 15 Massachusetts dry towns. The town remained dry for many years until 2005, when it was voted that alcohol could be served at restaurants. Sales at stores were not allowed until March 2019, when a local market was granted a liquor license and began to sell beer and wine.

In 1933, the Rockport American Legion Post. No. 98 built a scale model of &quot;Motif No.1&quot; for the Legion Parade, which was held in Chicago, Illinois, site of the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair. Designed by Aldro Hibbard and Anthony Thieme, with participation by the RAA, Board of Trade and townspeople &quot;from high to low&quot;, the float was commissioned in June, completed by the end of September, and driven in daylight only, from Rockport to Chicago, in less than a week. On October 3, 1933, among 200 floats, it won first place in the historic float competition. Upon the float&#x27;s return to Rockport, a crowd of over 4,000 people lined up and down the Great Hill (5 corners) to welcome the float home.

===The Labor Movement in Rockport Quarries===

Rockport, especially the Pigeon Cove area, has historically been home to many immigrant communities, notably Finns, Swedes, Italians, and Portuguese immigrants. Scandinavian immigrants often worked in the quarries, located at what is now Halibut Point State Park. Mediterranean immigrants arrived in the Early Republic, and the first Finnish and Swedish immigrants in the 1870s. Finns and Swedes were often lumped together as one group, and as Historian Jonathan Schwartz suggests, “a generalized &quot;Scandinavian&quot; identity for the Swedish and Finnish immigrants, at least in the eyes of the New England community”. These ethnic divisions were important pieces of working-class identities, and became more important as quarry workers become more involved in labor activism against the Rockport Granite Company, which first opened on February 10, 1865, and dissolved on December 31, 1933.

From March to June 1899, for example, a group of Finnish quarrymen, who were the newest immigrant groups brought in to work in the quarries, went on strike. Originally, Finns were brought to Pigeon Cove and the Rockport Granite quarries to break strikes in the early 1890s, but eventually became one of the most militant groups to fight for workers&#x27; rights. The 1899 strike was supported by the National Granite Cutters Union and the Quarry Workers Union, allegedly due to contract violations. This strike was particularly heated, with violence and arrests throughout the conflict. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; provided many reports of the Finns being particularly strong labor activists, refusing to cut deals and threatening those who tried to go to work during the strikes. The Rockport Granite Company attempted to bring in Italian laborers from Boston to act as strikebreakers in the spring of 1899. These temporary workers were housed in shanties near Blood Ledge quarry at Bay View, about half a mile from the quarry. The Finnish workers had heard about the Italians and attempted to communicate that they were on strike and hoped that the Italians would join their cause. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Italian workers had been brought to the quarry “under false pretenses” and about half of them abandoned work. Those who remained felt threatened and the Rockport Granite Company requested police protection for them.

On May 10, 1899, a number of Finnish strikers were arrested for their labor activism. On April 20, 1899, a group of two hundred Finns rallied and worked its way to the quarry shanties, armed with clubs and stones, eventually converging on the Italian workers who had taken refuge in the boiler house, even going so far as to pull the shutters off the building. Eventually, the strikers dispersed when one member was shot in the foot. The Italian worker groups were quite frightened of the Finnish strikers, and many of them ended up heading back to Boston after this incident.

On June 8, 1899, a bombing, suspected by police to be the work of strikers or someone invested in the strike, destroyed one of the company buildings inhabited by a John Nelson and six other workers who refused to join the strike. Fortunately, the workers were uninjured. Three Finns were arrested on suspicion of the crime. They later fled Rockport to avoid trial.

Eventually, the Finns and their fellow strikers would win the right to a nine-hour work day and time-and-a-half for overtime work, and assurances that the company would not discriminate against any of the over 2,000 workers who participated in the strike. During the early years of the twentieth century, quarry workers would strike for other rights with the support of their unions, notably in 1902, 1908, and 1916. The quarries eventually closed down operations in the Great Depression. Two explanations are possible for the closing of the quarry—the introduction of new building materials such as poured concrete and quarry workers&#x27; continued movement for higher wages into the 1920s. Swedish and Finnish workers continued to work in the quarries until their closure, and have left a distinct mark on the cultural heritage of Rockport.

===Modern Rockport===

Today Rockport is primarily a suburban residential and tourist town, but it is still home to a number of lobster fishermen and artists. Its rocky beaches and seaside parks are a favorite place for tourists from the Greater Boston Area and Rhode Island among other places.

==Geography==


The town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 60.14%, is water. Rockport lies at the far eastern end of Cape Ann and is surrounded on three sides by water. There are three islands, Straitsmouth Island, Thacher Island, and Milk Island, which lie off the coast of Rockport and are part of the town. The town&#x27;s shore is mostly rocky north of Lands End, but is somewhat less so south of there, as three of the town&#x27;s six beaches are on this 1-1/4-mile stretch of shoreline. Rockport Harbor and Old Harbor, both near the center of town, provide deeper water in which boats may dock, which provides ocean access to the fishing community. The town&#x27;s highest point is atop Pool Hill, which is surrounded by the town forest. The town&#x27;s other protected areas include Halibut Point State Park &amp; Reservation, the Thacher Island National Wildlife Refuge, and the Knight Wildlife Reservation on Milk Island, as well as a smaller area just south of Halibut Point run by the Massachusetts Audubon Society.

Rockport&#x27;s only neighboring town is Gloucester. Rockport is approximately east-northeast of Salem and northeast of Boston. There are no highways within the town but two state routes, Route 127 and Route 127A, pass through. Route 127 passes from north to south, entering inland from Gloucester, passing over Great Hill before following the sea from Back Harbor to Halibut Point and then back. Route 127A follows the southern coast, looping around Land&#x27;s End, Gap Head and the downtown area before reaching its northern terminus at Route 127. Bus service in Rockport is provided by the Cape Ann Transportation Authority. Rockport is also the last station on its eponymous branch of the Newburyport/Rockport Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail, providing service along the North Shore to Boston&#x27;s North Station. The nearest airport is the Beverly Regional Airport, with the nearest national and international service at Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport.

==Demographics==

<text>This is a list of cities in Japan sorted by prefecture and within prefecture by founding date. The list is also sortable by population, area, density and foundation date. Most large cities in Japan are cities designated by government ordinance. Some regionally important cities are designated as core cities. Tokyo is &quot;not&quot; included on this list, as the City of Tokyo ceased to exist on July 1, 1943. Tokyo now exists as a special metropolis prefecture (都 &quot;to&quot;), with 23 special wards (with the same status of city) making up the former boundaries of the former city in the eastern half of the prefecture.

<doc id="330618" wikidata="Q7493717" url="?curid=330618" title="Shell integration">
<text>Shell integration (the shell method in integral calculus) is a method for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution, when integrating along an axis &quot;perpendicular to&quot; the axis of revolution. This is in contrast to disc integration which integrates along the axis &quot;parallel&quot; to the axis of revolution.

==Definition==

The shell method goes as follows: Consider a volume in three dimensions obtained by rotating a cross-section in the -plane around the -axis. Suppose the cross-section is defined by the graph of the positive function on the interval . Then the formula for the volume will be:

:formula_1

If the function is of the coordinate and the axis of rotation is the -axis then the formula becomes:

:formula_2

If the function is rotating around the line then the formula becomes:

:formula_3 
and for rotations around it becomes 
:formula_4

The formula is derived by computing the double integral in polar coordinates.

=== Derivation of the formula ===

==Example==

Consider the volume, depicted below, whose cross section on the interval [1, 2] is defined by:

:formula_5

With the shell method we simply use the following formula:

:formula_6

By expanding the polynomial, the integration is easily done giving formula_7 cubic units.

=== Comparison With Disc Integration ===

Much more work is needed to find the volume if we use disc integration. First, we would need to solve formula_5 for . Next, because the volume is hollow in the middle, we would need two functions: one that defined an outer solid and one that defined the inner hollow. After integrating each of these two functions, we would subtract them to yield the desired volume.

<text>Sam Adams (born June 13, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, earning consensus All-American honors, and was selected eighth overall by the Seattle Seahawks in the 1994 NFL draft. Following six seasons as a member of the Seahawks, he earned consecutive Pro Bowl selections and All-Pro honors during his two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens. Adams was also part of the team that won a Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXV and made another championship appearance in his one season for the Oakland Raiders in 2002. As a member of the Buffalo Bills from 2003 to 2004, Adams was named to a third Pro Bowl. He spent his last two seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Denver Broncos.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Houston, Texas to former NFL offensive guard Sam Adams Sr. He attended Cypress Creek High School in Houston, and he was part of the Cypress Creek Cougars defense that included fellow future NFL player Dan Neil. At Cy-Creek, Adams was not only the Prep Southwest Defensive Player of the Year in football, but a state champion in the shot put, placing second in the nation among high school track and field athletes.

==College career==
Adams attended Texas A&amp;M University, where he was a starter for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team for three years. He was the Southwest Conference (SWC) Newcomer of the Year as a freshman in 1991 and a first-team freshman All-American. He was a first-team All-SWC selection in 1992 after making 56 tackles, including 4.5 quarterback sacks.

In his junior year, 1993, he led the team in tackles for loss (13), sacks (10.5), forced fumbles (5), and fumble recoveries (3), while making 78 tackles. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, and was named national defensive player of the year by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. He was also the Southwest Conference defensive player of the year, as well as the runner-up for the Lombardi Award. He finished his Texas A&amp;M football career with 169 total tackles, 23 tackles for a loss, 20.5 sacks, seven forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, and two interceptions.

He was also a member of the Texas A&amp;M track team, throwing the shot and discus and for his accomplishments on the track and on the gridiron, Adams was inducted into the Texas A&amp;M Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Professional career==
Adams was selected in the first round (eighth overall) by the Seattle Seahawks in the 1994 NFL draft. He played for the Seahawks from to . He made several starts during his rookie year, splitting time between defensive tackle and defensive end. In his second season, he sacked Mark Brunell of the Jacksonville Jaguars for a safety, scoring his first points of his professional career. He also blocked a field goal in overtime against the Arizona Cardinals. He played several more years for Seattle, making the AFC Pro Bowl team as an alternate in 1997. In 2000, he signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Ravens, and was a crucial piece in helping lead the most dominant defense in the league to a victory in Super Bowl XXXV. That season, he was also named as a starter in the Pro Bowl for the first time, a feat he would repeat the following season.

In 2002, he was a free agent once again, and signed with the Oakland Raiders. He started 14 of 16 games that season, playing in 15 of those 16 games; one was missed due to injury. He was on the team that went to Super Bowl XXXVII.

In 2003, Adams signed with the Buffalo Bills as a free agent and helped anchor the defensive line there. His first game for Buffalo was a memorable one, as he registered a sack, two tackles, and an interception against Tom Brady which was returned for his second career touchdown. He was a Pro Bowl alternate in 2003 for the second time in his career.

On March 1, 2006, Adams was released by the Bills due to salary cap issues. On March 30, Adams signed a three-year contract with the Cincinnati Bengals. As a Bengal, he was reunited with head coach Marvin Lewis, who was the defensive coordinator for the Ravens when Adams played for them.

Adams signed with the Denver Broncos on June 4, 2007. He was released on December 4.

<doc id="330627" wikidata="Q220503" url="?curid=330627" title="Assiniboine River">
<text>The Assiniboine River ( ; ) is a long river that runs through the prairies of Western Canada in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It is a tributary of the Red River. The Assiniboine is a typical meandering river with a single main channel embanked within a flat, shallow valley in some places and a steep valley in others. Its main tributaries are the Qu&#x27;Appelle, Souris, and Whitesand Rivers.

The river takes its name from the Assiniboine First Nation. Robert Douglas of the Geographical Board of Canada (1933) made several comments as to its origin: &quot;The name commemorates the Assiniboine natives called by La Vérendrye in 1730 &#x27;Assiniboils&#x27; and by Governor Knight in 1715 of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company &#x27;stone Indians.&#x27; Assiniboine is the name of an Indian tribe and is derived from &#x27;assine&#x27; a stone and &#x27;bwan&#x27; native name of the Sioux, hence Stony Sioux name was possibly given because they used heated stones in cooking their food.&quot;

== Course ==

The Assiniboine River rises in eastern Saskatchewan east of the community of Kelvington on the upper prairie level above the Manitoba Escarpment. The Assiniboine River flows through three basic zones with different channel characteristics. Upstream of Brandon, the main stem of the river and its most important tributaries flow within a very large valley. The valley was cut by huge glacial melt water flows at the end of the last glaciation. The floor of this spillway valley provides a natural floodplain for the river and the valley provides a significant storage volume making the construction of the Shellmouth Dam north of Russell both technically and economically viable. The major tributaries in this reach are the Qu&#x27;Appelle, Shell and Little Saskatchewan Rivers.

The glacial flows created a large delta east of Brandon extending almost to Portage la Prairie. The river has eroded down through sediments of the delta cutting a narrow valley through these sediments as it drops through a vertical distance of about to the Lake Agassiz – Red River Plain. In this valley, the river is confined with a narrow valley floor. The Souris River is the primary tributary contributing flow to the Assiniboine in this reach.
Near Portage la Prairie the river emerges from the delta reach onto the relatively flat Red River plain (the floor of former Glacial Lake Agassiz) and at this point it can flow in any direction from roughly northwest to roughly southeast. The gradient of the river channel within the delta reach to the west is relatively high, so the river water velocities are fairly high and the waters of the river carry significant amounts of sediment. The gradient in the flat Red River plain is much less and the velocity of the river water flowing over this plain is much lower. Therefore, the sediments carried by the river waters as they flow through the delta reach are deposited onto the plain. The Assiniboine winds its way east eventually joining the Red River at &quot;The Forks&quot; in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Today, &quot;Assiniboine Herald&quot; at the Canadian Heraldic Authority is named after the river. Asessippi Provincial Park, an RV park was built on the east shore of the Shellmouth Reservoir.

The Assiniboine River has changed course numerous times over past centuries. It has followed its modern course for approximately 700 years. The Assiniboine River formerly met the Red River near the present-day mouth of the La Salle River. A Government of Manitoba report following the 2011 Assiniboine River Flood found that the flood &quot;could have resulted in the river flowing east by a different route, possibly joining the Red River south of Winnipeg, or potentially even flowing north to Lake Manitoba as it did thousands of years ago,&quot; without the flood control infrastructure currently in place.

=== Tributaries ===
Notable tributaries of the Assiniboine River include:
*Whitesand River, which joins it near Kamsack, Saskatchewan
*Lilian River, which joins it at Sturgis, Saskatchewan
*Souris River, which joins it near Wawanesa, Manitoba
*Birdtail Creek which joins at the Birdtail Sioux First Nation
*Little Saskatchewan River, which joins west of Brandon
*Qu&#x27;Appelle River, which joins near the site of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company historic Fort Ellice site

== Flow rates and flood potential ==

There are three hydrometric stations on the river that have been taking measurements since 1913. The Assiniboine River near Headingley has an average discharge of . One millimeter of runoff from half the watershed would take 70 hours to drain at flow rates of . The following discharge rates were recorded during the 1995 flood:
It is prone to spring flooding. Some flood flows can be diverted into Lake Manitoba at Portage la Prairie. In 1967, the Shellmouth Dam was built in Shellmouth to help reduce flood peaks and to supplement flows during dry periods. The Portage Diversion was completed in 1970. Despite these efforts, in May 2011 it was necessary to breach one of the dikes beside the river to relieve flood stresses east of Portage la Prairie. A Manitoba-wide state of emergency was declared in the wake of one in three hundred-year floods on the Assiniboine River at Brandon. Below are the actual observed flow rates for major floods at different locations along the river:
*Note: Flows in 1882 occurred before any flood protection measures such as the Shellmouth Reservoir and Portage Diversion were built.

Looking specifically at the Assiniboine River at Portage La Prairie, where maximum river flows occur prior to historical spillovers (prior to construction of the Portage Diversion and the Lower Assiniboine River Dikes) into the watersheds of Lake Manitoba and the La Salle River, the top 10 calculated natural peak flow rates before construction of the current flood infrastructure are:

== Fish species ==
Fish species commonly found in the river include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, mooneye, burbot, channel catfish, brown bullhead, rock bass, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, and common carp.

<text>The House of Welf (also Guelf or Guelph) is a European dynasty that has included many German and British monarchs from the 11th to 20th century and Emperor Ivan VI of Russia in the 18th century. The originally Franconian family from the Meuse-Moselle area was closely related to the imperial family of the Carolingians.

==Origins==
The (Younger) House of Welf is the older branch of the House of Este, a dynasty whose earliest known members lived in Veneto and Lombardy in the late 9th/early 10th century, sometimes called Welf-Este. The first member was Welf I, Duke of Bavaria, also known as Welf IV. He inherited the property of the Elder House of Welf when his maternal uncle Welf III, Duke of Carinthia and Verona, the last male Welf of the Elder House, died in 1055.

Welf IV was the son of Welf III&#x27;s sister Kunigunde of Altdorf and her husband Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan. In 1070, Welf IV became Duke of Bavaria.

Welf II, Duke of Bavaria married Countess Matilda of Tuscany, who died childless and left him her possessions, including Tuscany, Ferrara, Modena, Mantua, and Reggio, which played a role in the Investiture Controversy. Since the Welf dynasty sided with the Pope in this controversy, partisans of the Pope came to be known in Italy as Guelphs (&quot;Guelfi&quot;).

The first genealogy of the Welfs is the &quot;Genealogia Welforum&quot;, composed shortly before 1126. A much more detailed history of the dynasty, the &quot;Historia Welforum&quot;, was composed around 1170. It is the earliest history of a noble house in Germany.

==Bavaria and Saxony==
Henry IX, Duke of Bavaria, from 1120 to 1126, was the first of the three dukes of the Welf dynasty called Henry. His wife Wulfhild was the heiress of the house of Billung, possessing the territory around Lüneburg in Lower Saxony. Their son, Henry the Proud, was the son-in-law and heir of Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor and became also Duke of Saxony on Lothair&#x27;s death.

Lothair left his territory around Brunswick, inherited from his mother of the Brunonids, to his daughter Gertrud. Her husband Henry the Proud became then the favoured candidate in the imperial election against Conrad III of the Hohenstaufen. Henry lost the election, as the other princes feared his power and temperament, and was dispossessed of his duchies by Conrad III.

Henry&#x27;s brother Welf VI (1115–1191), Margrave of Tuscany, later left his Swabian territories around Ravensburg, the original possessions of the Elder House of Welf, to his nephew Emperor Frederick I, and thus to the House of Hohenstaufen.
The next duke of the Welf dynasty Henry the Lion (1129/1131–1195) recovered his father&#x27;s two duchies, Saxony in 1142, Bavaria in 1156 and thus ruled vast parts of Germany. In 1168 he married Matilda (1156–1189), the daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, and sister of Richard I of England, gaining ever more influence. His first cousin, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, tried to get along with him, but when Henry refused to assist him once more in an Italian war campaign, conflict became inevitable.

Dispossessed of his duchies after the Battle of Legnano in 1176 by Emperor Frederick I and the other princes of the German Empire eager to claim parts of his vast territories, he was exiled to the court of his father-in-law Henry II in Normandy in 1180. He returned to Germany three years later.

Henry made his peace with the Hohenstaufen Emperor in 1185 and returned to his much diminished lands around Brunswick without recovering his two duchies. Bavaria had been given to Otto I, Duke of Bavaria, and the Duchy of Saxony was divided between the Archbishop of Cologne, the House of Ascania and others. Henry died at Brunswick in 1195.
==Brunswick and Hanover==
Henry the Lion&#x27;s son, Otto of Brunswick, was elected King of the Romans and crowned Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV after years of further conflicts with the Hohenstaufen emperors. He incurred the wrath of Pope Innocent III and was excommunicated in 1215. Otto was forced to abdicate the imperial throne by the Hohenstaufen Frederick II. He was the only Welf to become Holy Roman Emperor.
Henry the Lion&#x27;s grandson Otto the Child became duke of a part of Saxony in 1235, the new Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and died there in 1252. The duchy was divided several times during the High Middle Ages amongst various lines of the House of Welf. The subordinate states had the legal status of principalities within the duchy, which remained as an undivided imperial fief. Each state was generally named after the ruler&#x27;s residence, e.g., the rulers of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel originally lived in Wolfenbüttel.

Whenever a branch of the family died out in the male line, the territory was given to another line, as the duchy remained enfeoffed to the family as a whole rather than its individual members. All members of the House of Welf, male or female, bore the title &quot;Duke/Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg&quot; in addition to the style of the subordinate principality. By 1705, the subordinate principalities had taken their final form as the Electorate of Hanover and the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and these would become the Kingdom of Hanover and the Duchy of Brunswick after the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

===Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel===
In 1269 the Principality of Brunswick was formed following the first division of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1432, as a result of increasing tensions with the townsfolk of Brunswick, the Brunswick Line moved their residence to Wolfenbüttel Castle, thus the name &quot;Wolfenbüttel&quot; became the unofficial name of this principality. With Ivan VI of Russia the Brunswick line even had a short intermezzo on the Russian imperial throne in 1740. Not until 1754 was the residence moved back to Brunswick, into the new Brunswick Palace. In 1814 the principality became the Duchy of Brunswick, ruled by the senior branch of the House of Welf.

=== Principality of Calenberg – later Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg ===

In 1432 the estates gained by the &quot;Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel&quot; between the Deister and Leine split away as the &quot;Principality of Calenberg&quot;. In 1495 it was expanded around Göttingen and in 1584 went back to the Wolfenbüttel Line. In 1634, as a result of inheritance distributions, it went to the House of Luneburg residing at Celle Castle. In 1635 it was given to George, younger brother of Prince Ernest II of Lüneburg, who chose Hanover as his residence.

New territory was added in 1665, and in 1705 the Principality of Luneburg was taken over by the Hanoverians. In 1692 Duke Ernest Augustus from the Calenberg-Hanover Line acquired the right to be a prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire as the Prince-Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Colloquially the Electorate was known as the Electorate of Hanover. In 1814 it was succeeded by the Kingdom of Hanover.

===British succession===
Religion-driven politics placed Ernest Augustus&#x27;s wife Sophia of the Palatinate in the line of succession to the British crown by the Act of Settlement 1701, written to ensure a Protestant succession to the thrones of Scotland and England at a time when anti-Catholic sentiment ran high in much of Northern Europe and Great Britain. Sophia died shortly before her first cousin once removed, Anne, Queen of Great Britain, the last sovereign of the House of Stuart.

Sophia&#x27;s son George I succeeded Queen Anne and formed a personal union from 1714 between the British crown and the Electorate of Hanover, which lasted until well after the end of the Napoleonic Wars more than a century later, through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the rise of a new successor kingdom. The British royal family became known as the House of Hanover.
===Kingdom of Hanover===
The &quot;Electorate of Hanover&quot; (the core duchy) was enlarged with the addition of other lands and became the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 at the Congress of Vienna. During the first half of the nineteenth century, the Kingdom was ruled as personal union by the British crown from its creation under George III of the United Kingdom, the last elector of Hanover until the death of William IV in 1837.

At that point, the crown of Hanover went to William&#x27;s younger brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale under the Salic law requiring the next male heir to inherit, whereas the British throne was inherited by an elder brother&#x27;s only daughter, Queen Victoria. Her offspring belong to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha: in 1917 the name was changed to the House of Windsor.

The Kingdom of Hanover was lost in 1866 by Ernest Augustus&#x27;s son George V of Hanover, Austria&#x27;s ally during the Austro-Prussian War, when it was annexed by Prussia after Austria&#x27;s defeat and became the Prussian province of Hanover. The Welfs went into exile at Gmunden, Austria, where they built &quot;Cumberland Castle&quot;.

===Brunswick succession===
The senior line of the dynasty had ruled the much smaller principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, created the sovereign Duchy of Brunswick in 1814. This line became extinct in 1884. Although the Duchy should have been inherited by the Duke of Cumberland, son of the last king of Hanover, Prussian suspicions of his loyalty led the duchy&#x27;s throne to remain vacant until 1913, when the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s son, Ernst August, married the daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II and was allowed to inherit it. His rule there was short-lived, as the monarchy came to an end following the First World War in 1918.

The Welf dynasty continues to exist. The last member sitting on a European throne was Frederica of Hanover, Queen of Greece († 1981), mother of Queen Sofia of Spain and King Constantine II of Greece. Frederica&#x27;s brother Prince George William of Hanover married Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark, sister of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The House&#x27;s head is Queen Frederica&#x27;s nephew Ernst August, the third and present husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco.

<text>Octavio Víctor &quot;Cookie&quot; Rojas Rivas (born March 6, 1939), is a Cuban-American former professional baseball player, coach, manager and current television sports presenter. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman and outfielder from to , most prominently for the Philadelphia Phillies where he first became an All-Star player, and later with the Kansas City Royals where his veteran experience and leadership played an integral role in helping the young Royals franchise develop into a championship team.

Although Rojas began his career as a second baseman, he was an extremely versatile athlete who could play any defensive position. He was named to four consecutive American League (AL) All-Star teams (1971-74) during his tenure with Kansas City and led the AL in fielding percentage in 1971, including a 52-game errorless streak as a second baseman.

After his playing career, Rojas worked as a coach for the Chicago Cubs and the California Angels before he became the manager of the Angels in 1988. He later worked as a coach for the Florida Marlins, New York Mets and the Toronto Blue Jays, participating in his first World Series with the Mets in . 

In 2003, Rojas began working for the Miami Marlins on their Spanish-language telecasts as a color commentator. In 1987, he was inducted into the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame, and he was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Early life and minor leagues==
Playing baseball over the objections of his father, who wanted him to be a doctor, Rojas signed his first professional baseball contract with the Cincinnati Reds as a 17-year-old amateur free agent prior to the start of the 1956 season. Rojas was then assigned to Cincinnati&#x27;s D-level team, the West Palm Beach Sun Chiefs in the Florida State League. 

From 1957 to 1959, Rojas would make steady progress through the Reds&#x27; minor league system, playing for the Wausau Lumberjacks in the C-level Northern League in 1957, the Savannah Redlegs in the Single A Sally League in 1958, before coming home and playing for the Havana Sugar Kings in the AAA International League. His advancement through the system was steady despite his batting average falling every year between 1956 and 1960, finally bottoming out at .225. 

Although he possessed an above-average glove, the Reds were not sure he&#x27;d ever hit enough to play regularly in the majors. Consequently, he would spend the next three seasons at AAA, playing for Havana and the Jersey City Jerseys, where he would continue to struggle with his bat while being blocked in the majors by superior Reds&#x27; second basemen in All Stars Johnny Temple, Billy Martin, and Don Blasingame. Rojas would finally go north with the Reds at the beginning of the 1962 season and would make his major league debut on April 10. However, he would continue to show little at the plate, hitting .221 with only 2 extra base hits in 78 at bats, and would be sent down to the AAA Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs for the remainder of the season.

==Major league career==
After the 1962 season, Rojas was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for relief pitcher Jim Owens. Although the Phillies already had an All-Star second baseman in fellow Cuban Tony Taylor, Rojas had seen the last of the minor leagues and would man second in 27 games in 1963. Although he became the regular Phillies second baseman in 1965, Rojas would go on to play at every fielding position, including catcher and pitcher, but would see the bulk of his playing time in the outfield and shortstop in addition to second base. Getting more playing time helped improve his batting, as Rojas hit .291 in 1964 and a career-high .303 in 1965, when he was named to his first All-Star team. As a Phillie, Rojas teamed with shortstop Bobby Wine in a stellar double-play combination that media and fans began to refer as “The Plays of Wine and Rojas,” a takeoff of the song, &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;.
Following the 1969 season in which Rojas hit only .228 and hot prospect Denny Doyle tore through AAA with a .310 average, the Phillies decided to include him in the blockbuster trade that sent slugging first baseman Dick Allen and right-handed pitcher Jerry Johnson to the St. Louis Cardinals for centerfielder Curt Flood, catcher Tim McCarver, outfielder Byron Browne, and left-handed pitcher Joe Hoerner, the trade that led ultimately to Major League baseball free agency. 

By the time the Phillies traded Rojas to the Cardinals in 1970, it appeared his career might be over, as he was hitting only .106 going into the June trading deadline. St. Louis in turn traded him to the Kansas City Royals for outfielder/third baseman Fred Rico on June 13. Kansas City, a team in only its second year of existence, wanted a veteran presence to steady its infield, and in return for the career–minor leaguer Rico, the Royals gained a player who would man second base for most of the next eight seasons and appear in four consecutive All-Star games from 1971 to 1974.

In April 1970, at least one news report mistakenly said Rojas was critically injured in an auto accident. In fact it was former major leaguer Minnie Rojas. In the 1972 All-Star Game in Atlanta, he hit a pinch-hit, two-run homer in the eighth inning, which was the first time that a non-American-born player had ever homered for the American League in the mid-summer classic.

Though a fan favorite, Rojas lost his job as the Royals&#x27; starting second baseman to Frank White in 1976, who was much younger than the 37-year-old Rojas and both hit and fielded better than Rojas. Remaining with the team for two more years, Rojas filled a utility role with the team, playing at first, second and third base, and designated hitter. After being released by the team after the 1977 season, Rojas spent 1978 on the sidelines. Despite signing with the Chicago Cubs on September 1, he did not get into a game with the team and retired from baseball.

Rojas is currently in second place on the Royals all-time list of games played at second base with 789, second only to White.

==Career statistics==

His main position was second base, recording a .984 fielding percentage in 1445 games at that position. He has played all other infield (including catcher) and outfield positions as well.

==Coaching career==
After his playing career, Rojas coached and scouted for various teams. From 1978 to 1981 he was a coach for the Chicago Cubs. In 1988, he became only the third Cuban-born manager in major-league history when he took the helm of the California Angels, whom he had guided to fourth place with a 75–79 record before being replaced with Moose Stubing with eight games left in the season (with the Angels losing all eight games). In 1996, Rojas managed one game for the Florida Marlins after manager Rene Lachemann was fired before John Boles finished the season for the Marlins.

During the 1999 playoffs, while coaching third base for the New York Mets, Rojas was suspended for five games for getting into a shoving match with umpire Charlie Williams while arguing a foul ball call. Rojas also served as the team&#x27;s third base coach during the 2000 season, in which they appeared in the World Series. From 2001 to 2002 he was bench coach with the Toronto Blue Jays and was unofficial manager for 3 games in 2001.

For the 2002 season, Rojas was third base coach for the Toronto Blue Jays.

==Personal life==
Rojas&#x27; second youngest son, Victor, was previously the lead play-by-play announcer for the Los Angeles Angels, and is now the general manager of the Frisco RoughRiders. His second-oldest son, Mike, is a minor league manager and former MLB bullpen coach for the Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners.

In 2011, he was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame.

<doc id="330637" wikidata="Q3894449" url="?curid=330637" title="Belmont Park">
<text>Belmont Park is a thoroughbred horse racetrack in Elmont, New York, just east of New York City limits best known for hosting the Belmont Stakes, the final leg of the American Triple Crown. It was opened on May 4, 1905, and is one of the best well known racetracks in the United States. The original structure was demolished in 1963, and a second facility opened in 1968. The second structure was demolished in 2023, and a third version of Belmont Park is expected to open in 2026.

Operated by the New York Racing Association (NYRA), Belmont Park is typically open for racing from late April through mid-July (known as the Spring meet), and again from mid-September through late October (the Fall meet). The race park&#x27;s main dirt track has earned the nickname, &quot;the Big Sandy&quot;, given its prominent overall dimensions and the deep, sometimes tiring surface. Belmont is also sometimes known as &quot;The Championship Track&quot; because almost every major champion in racing history since the early 20th century has competed on the racecourse – including all of the Triple Crown winners. Belmont Park, with its large, wide, sweeping turns and long homestretch, is considered one of the fairest racetracks in America.

Belmont hosted its largest crowd at the 2004 Belmont Stakes, when 120,139 spectators saw Smarty Jones upset by Birdstone in his Triple Crown bid.

== History ==

=== First Belmont Park (1903–1963) ===

August Belmont Jr. and William Collins Whitney, along with other investors, built the original Belmont race track, which opened on May 4, 1905. Arthur Underhill was hired as Engineer and Landscape Architect to design and oversee construction of the park. In its first 15 or so years, Belmont Park featured racing clockwise, in the &quot;English fashion&quot;—allowing the upper-class members of the racing association and their guests to have the races finish in front of the clubhouse, just to the west of the grandstand. A &quot;field stand,&quot; at what was then the top of the stretch, was located east of the grandstand. The original finish line was located at the top of the present-day homestretch. In his 1925 book, &quot;The Big Town&quot;, Ring W. Lardner refers to the then-recent directional change when he has a character at Belmont say (speaking of a recent race) &quot;At that time, they run the wrong way of the track, like you would deal cards&quot;.

A later innovation was created by Joseph E. Widener, who took over track leadership when August Belmont II died in 1924: the Widener Chute. It was a straightaway of just under that cut diagonally through Belmont&#x27;s training and main tracks, hitting near the quarter-pole of the main track; the course was removed in 1958.

Two features of the original Belmont Park remain today. The first is the display of four stone pillars on Hempstead Turnpike, a gift from the mayor and park commissioners of Charleston, South Carolina. The pillars had stood at the entrance of the Washington Course of the South Carolina Jockey Club in Charleston, which operated from 1792 to 1882. The stone pillars are now found at the clubhouse entrance. Lesser known but more visible are the racing motif iron railings seen partially bordering the walking ring. The railings, used as decoration on the south side of the old Belmont grandstand, were salvaged during the 1963 demolition.

The original Belmont Park was not only unprecedented in its size but also had the then-new innovation of a Long Island Rail Road extension from the Queens Village station, running along the property, tunneling under Hempstead Turnpike, then terminating on the south side of the property. The train terminal was moved to its present location north of the turnpike after the 1956 season.

Near the railroad terminal was yet &quot;another&quot; track—Belmont Park Terminal, a steeplechase course operated by United Hunts until 1927.

The last race at the old Belmont Park was run in October 1962. In spring 1963, NYRA Chairman James Cox Brady announced that two separate engineering surveys found the grandstand/clubhouse was unsafe due to age-induced structural defects and needed to be rebuilt. The book &quot;Belmont Park: A Century of Champions&quot; noted the comment of NYRA President Edward T. Dickinson: &quot;When you sighted down the stands, you could see some of the beams were twisted. They were in something of an S-shape.&quot;

The old structure was demolished in 1963, along with the Manice Mansion, the turreted 19th-century homestead that served as the headquarters of Belmont&#x27;s Turf and Field Club.

==== Aviation meets ====
In addition to racing history, Belmont Park made history in another industry native to the Hempstead Plains – aviation. Some 150,000 people were drawn to the track on October 30, 1910, at the climax of a Wright Brothers-staged International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park, which had started eight years earlier. The event came at the beginning of a period from 1910 to 1912 in which racing was outlawed in New York State.

Eight years later, Belmont and aviation were reunited when the racetrack served as the northern point of the first U.S. air mail route, between the New York area and Washington, D.C.

=== Second Belmont Park (1968–2024) ===
The Belmont race meetings were moved to Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, Queens from 1963 to 1968. During this period, the second grandstand was built and the Inner Turf Course was also added.

The $30.7 million grandstand, designed by Arthur Froehlich, was opened May 20, 1968, and was the largest in Thoroughbred racing. It had a total attendance capacity of more than 100,000, including a seating capacity of 33,000 and an adjoining backyard being able to accommodate more than 10,000.

A long mural by Pierre Bellocq on the second floor of the clubhouse featuring the dominant jockeys, trainers and racing personalities celebrates the track&#x27;s history.

In May 2007, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer considered closing Aqueduct Racetrack located ten miles west of Belmont in Ozone Park, New York, and turning Belmont into a nearly year-round race track when the New York Racing Association lease for all three of New York State&#x27;s tracks expired at the end of 2007. Belmont&#x27;s stands would have been heated, additional barns built for Aqueduct&#x27;s 400 horses, and the track modified to accommodate winter racing. In addition, video lottery machines would have been introduced. A new entity would have operated Belmont from fall to spring while the New York Racing Association would continue to operate Saratoga Race Course in the summer. Spitzer was forced to resign amid a prostitution scandal in March 2008 and no further plans for Belmont were developed at that time.

In December 2022, the New York Racing Association formally announced its intention to upgrade the facilities at Belmont to make it suitable to host year-round thoroughbred racing and training. Unlike Churchill and Pimlico, neither the first nor second iterations of Belmont Park allowed spectators into the infield. An infield tunnel connecting to the backstretch parking lot has been completed.

Beginning in April 2023 construction of a one-mile synthetic racing oval inside the inner turf course had begun. The next phase of reconstruction, which began after the 2023 spring and summer meet, included completion of the synthetic track, widening of the inner turf course, and construction of a second infield tunnel near the first turn. NYRA released a statement on May 1, 2023, announcing that state funding for the grandstand reconstruction and other projects had been secured by way of a $455 million loan.

The final day of racing at the second Belmont Park was held on July 9, 2023.

Demolition began in March 2024 and was completed in June 2024.

==== UBS Arena ====
In July 2017, New York State officials announced that vacant parking lots behind the Belmont grandstand had been put to tender for two area top-level professional sports teams: the New York Islanders, an NHL ice hockey team; and New York City FC, an MLS soccer team. Both teams were unhappy with their current locations (the Islanders at Barclays Center; New York City FC at Yankee Stadium) and proposed to redevelop the land into their own stadiums. The Islanders proposed an 18,000 seat sports arena, for retail development, a 225-room hotel, and a community center, while NYCFC&#x27;s pledge included a 26,000 seat soccer ground, for retail, a community park, and soccer complex: both proposals were fully privately funded and included improved parking and LIRR facilities as well.

On December 20, 2017, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Islanders project had won approval to be built. In July 2019, the plan was adopted by the Empire State Development Corporation board, and UBS Arena opened in time for the 2021-22 NHL season. The plan also included a new Elmont station on the LIRR, in addition to the hotel, arena, and retail village.

===Third Belmont Park (under construction; 2026 opening planned) ===
As of July 2024, the second Belmont Park is completely demolished with reconstruction planned until September 2026. The new grandstand, when finished, will likely result in the track hosting the Breeders&#x27; Cup for the first time since 2005.

To accommodate construction, NYRA moved the Belmont fall meet to Aqueduct in 2022, 2023, and 2024. The 2024 Belmont Stakes were moved to Saratoga Race Course, due to the renovations, and the 2025 Belmont Stakes are planned for Saratoga as well.

It was reported in February 2025 that the foundation for the new grandstand had been poured. The outlines for the new dirt, turf and synthetic courses had been set, with plans for the turf courses to be of shorter circumference and the finish line moved forward by 125 feet compared to previous course configurations. The new Belmont Park facility is planned to open in September 2026, which would ultimately lead to the closure of nearby Aqueduct Racetrack. This schedule may also result in the 2026 Belmont Stakes being held at Saratoga, although the option of holding that year&#x27;s race at Belmont Park had been discussed previously.

== Physical attributes ==

The racing, training and barn complex is located on the western edge of the Nassau County region known as the Hempstead Plains. Just a few miles (kilometers) east on the same plains, the first racing meet in North America was held in 1665, supervised by colonial governor Richard Nicolls.

The dirt racecourse, known officially as the &quot;Main Track&quot; and nicknamed &quot;Big Sandy&quot; by racing followers, has a circumference of , the longest dirt thoroughbred racetrack in North America. Immediately inside of this is the &quot;Widener Turf Course&quot; (named after the Widener family that has a long and prestigious history in American horse racing) spanning plus , which in turn encircles an &quot;Inner Turf Course&quot; with a circumference of plus . On the Main Track, it is from the top of the stretch to the finish line, and the segment between the wire and the start of the first (clubhouse) turn covers ; this latter segment is shorter by approximately on both of the turf courses, in order to accommodate the two chutes that exist on the Widener Turf Course, from which turf races of and are started; an additional chute exists for races of on the Inner Turf Course.A straightaway chute leads on to the backstretch of the Main Track and permits races on the dirt up to long to be run with one turn. The chute used to extend further back across the training track, permitting races of up to a mile and a quarter but was shortened because a crossover is now infeasible given the clay base of the Main Track and stone-dust base of the training track. Before the 1990 Breeders&#x27; Cup, the outer rail of the Main Track was moved back to widen the middle of the clubhouse turn and soften the angle of the start of the Classic. The training track is in circumference and abuts the east end of the main track. In March 2009, lights were added to the training track as a safety measure to prevent early morning workouts from occurring in the dark.

== Geopolitical status ==

The racetrack, grandstand, training, and barn facilities are located entirely in the community of Elmont in Nassau County, New York. According to the City of New York&#x27;s own map portal, the Long Island Rail Road station on the property, the ramp between the grandstand and the train station, and some of the adjoining parking fields straddle the Queens County line.

Belmont Park has direct on- and off-ramps to the Cross Island Parkway, which runs north–south and is just to the west of the park. Belmont Park&#x27;s physical address is given as 2150 Hempstead Turnpike (New York State Route 24).

The Belmont Park property originally totaled some . After the 1956 season, the construction of a wider bus road beyond the main course&#x27;s final turn forced the turn to be shortened. According to the Belmont publication commemorating the track&#x27;s 1968 reopening, that move cut off its circumference. The current layout has the entire racing course inside Nassau County.

== Racing ==
=== Belmont Stakes ===
The Belmont Stakes was named after financier and sportsman August Belmont Sr., who helped fund the race, and most sources say the racetrack itself was also named for him.

The race was first run in 1867 at Jerome Park Racetrack in the Bronx. In 1937, the wrought iron gates that bore an illustration of that first Belmont Stakes were donated to Belmont Park by August Belmont II&#x27;s sole surviving son, Perry Belmont. The gates were located on the fourth floor of Belmont Park&#x27;s clubhouse until the 2024 demolition.

The Belmont Stakes races have been run at Belmont Park since 1905, with the exceptions of 1911–12, when gambling was banned in New York State; the 1963–67 editions, held at Aqueduct while the grandstands at Belmont Park were reconstructed; and the 2024 edition, which was held at Saratoga Race Course due to the second reconstruction of Belmont Park.

Secretariat&#x27;s finishing time in his 1973 Belmont victory (2 minutes, 24 seconds) set a world record for on dirt, a world record which still stands. The 31-length victory clinched the first Triple Crown in 25 years, dating back to Citation in 1948. A statue of Secretariat is in the center of the Belmont paddock.

Another Belmont Stakes achievement is recognized by the &quot;Woody&#x27;s Corner&quot; display that was located in the first-floor clubhouse lobby, commemorating the five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners trained by Woody Stephens from 1982 to 1986.

The racetrack was also the site of Affirmed&#x27;s epic stretch duel with Alydar in the 1978 Belmont Stakes, a victory that gave Affirmed the Triple Crown; and Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew&#x27;s defeat of Affirmed in the Marlboro Cup in September of that same year. The Marlboro, a key event of the Fall Championship meets in the 1970s and 1980s, included a dramatic come-from-behind win by Forego in the 1976 installment.

Officials of the New York Racing Association made a concerted effort to boost attendance on Belmont Stakes Day after the 1995 installment drew only 37,171.

The 2000 and 2001 Belmonts—both run when there was no Triple Crown on the line—drew announced crowds of 67,810 and 73,857.

In 2004, a record attendance of 120,139 was on hand to see if Smarty Jones would be the first Triple Crown winner since 1978.

American Pharoah won the 2015 Belmont Stakes on June 6, and became the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years. It was announced before the race that attendance would be capped at 90,000. That year&#x27;s Kentucky Derby and Preakness both set attendance records, over 170,000 and 130,000 respectively.

=== Other key races at Belmont ===
In addition to the Belmont Stakes, other major races held at Belmont have included the Jockey Club Gold Cup, the Suburban Handicap and the Memorial Day standby—the Metropolitan Handicap, also known as the &quot;Met Mile.&quot;

An important race for fillies, the Acorn Stakes, which is the first leg of the US Triple Tiara, is raced at the track year.

All of the above races are contested on dirt; notable turf (grass) races include the Belmont Derby, Belmont Oaks, Manhattan Handicap, Just A Game Handicap, Bowling Green Handicap, Man O&#x27; War Stakes, Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes and the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational.

Belmont&#x27;s Fall Championship meet includes New York Showcase Day in late October, with seven stakes races for New York-bred horses. The richest race on that program is the $250,000 Empire Classic Handicap.

Other memorable performances in Belmont Park history include the opening of the track in 1905 with the famous dead heat between Sysonby and Race King in the Met Cap. In 1923, Belmont Park was host to an international duel between the American and English champions: Zev, winner of the Kentucky Derby, against Papyrus, winner of The Derby. Zev won by five lengths in front of an estimated crowd of 70,000.

Belmont Park was the site of the tragedy-marred victory of Foolish Pleasure over champion filly Ruffian in a 1975 match race. Ruffian broke down during the race and had to be euthanized. She was buried near the finish line in the infield at Belmont Park, her nose pointed towards the finish pole, from 1975 until 2023.

=== Meets ===

Before the 2024 reconstruction, racing at Belmont Park was conducted in two annual installments, or &quot;meetings&quot;. The &quot;spring-summer meeting&quot; usually began on the Thursday or Friday of the week before the Kentucky Derby in April and lasts through the first or second Sunday in July, depending on the start of the Saratoga meet that follows. The Saratoga meet was expanded to eight weeks in 2019. The &quot;fall meeting&quot; follows the Saratoga season, commencing on the Thursday or Friday after Labor Day and ending on either the last Sunday in October or in some years the first Sunday in November, usually dependent on the dates of the Breeders&#x27; Cup. Racing is held at Saratoga Race Course, during the time between these two meetings.

Prior to 1977, a summer meeting was contested at Aqueduct from mid-June until the Saratoga meet began; its abolition led to the Belmont spring meeting being lengthened to its present duration.

The autumn installment is known as the Fall Championship meet, since many of the eventual Eclipse Award title winners have earned key victories in some of the meeting&#x27;s races, such as the Jockey Club Gold Cup.

Belmont has been home to the day-long Breeders&#x27; Cup championship in 1990, 1995, 2001 and most recently in 2005.

Belmont&#x27;s backyard is well known as a gathering place for racing fans to see their horses saddled before they hit the track. The center of the paddock is dominated by a white pine that pre-dated the track itself—it turned 180 years old in 2006.

== Belmont track announcers ==
Because of Belmont&#x27;s role in hosting big, nationally televised races on broadcast and cable TV, its track announcers have been among the best known in the sport. Among the famous race callers who&#x27;ve served as Belmont PA announcers are:

* Fred Capossela (1940–1971)
* Dave Johnson (1972–1977) - Contrary to popular belief, Johnson, not Anderson, was Belmont Park&#x27;s PA announcer during Secretariat&#x27;s 1973 romp in the Belmont Stakes. There is no known audio to exist of Johnson&#x27;s call of that Belmont. It was on TV that Anderson called the 1973 Belmont Stakes aired by CBS Television, where he famously described Big Red as &quot;moving like a tremendous machine&quot;.
* Chic Anderson (1977–1979)
* Marshall Cassidy (1979–1990)
* Tom Durkin (1990–2014)
* Larry Collmus (2014–2020)
* John Imbriale (2020–2023)

== In popular culture ==
Belmont Park has been featured in the following:

=== Comedy ===
Comedian Robert Klein made Capossella&#x27;s race calls the subject of one of his routines, captured on his 1974 album &quot;Mind Over Matter.&quot;

=== Film ===
Scenes for the Woody Allen movies &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995) and &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; (2004) were shot at Belmont Park, as was a paddock scene for the 1990s remake of the film &quot;Gloria&quot; with Sharon Stone and George C. Scott.

Scenes for the movie &quot;St. Vincent&quot; (2014) starring Bill Murray were shot at Belmont Park.

Belmont Park was one of the racetracks referred to in the song &quot;It&#x27;s A Simple Little System&quot; in the Judy Holliday - Dean Martin musical Bells Are Ringing. (The code name assigned to it was &quot;Beethoven.&quot;)

=== Music ===
Belmont has hosted some concerts over the years including Natalie Cole (1979), Blondie (1979) and the Goo Goo Dolls (2015).

=== Television ===
A January 1975 episode in season 5 of the ABC sitcom &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; — entitled &quot;Felix the Horse Player&quot;—was filmed partly at Belmont Park, though one of the race clips on the show features the shot of an Aqueduct starting gate.

A few years later, Dick Cavett took the camera crew of his PBS talk show to Belmont for a look at horse racing.

In November 2004, Belmont Park was featured in an episode of the ninth season of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, titled Boys&#x27; Therapy, in which Frank, Robert, and Ray bet on a horse named &quot;Marie&#x27;s Mouth&quot;.

In 2015, Belmont Park was featured on the season finale of &quot;The Amazing Race 27&quot;.

<text>Solidaridad is one of the eleven municipalities that make up the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Its municipal seat is the town of Playa del Carmen.

Solidaridad is home to the Maya archaeological site of Xcaret.

==Geography==

The municipality has some small but rich continental sites including the ecotourism park of Xcaret. Prior to the creation of the Municipality of Tulum, the municipality was situated between latitudes 20° 45&#x27; and 19° 46&#x27; north and longitudes 86° 57&#x27; and 88° 05&#x27; west, and had an area of . Today, it borders the municipalities of Benito Juárez and Lázaro Cárdenas to the north and Tulum to the south; and is separated in most places from its neighboring municipality to the east (Cozumel) by a stretch of the Caribbean Sea known as the Cozumel Channel.

The ecotourism park of Xel-Ha and the Calica limestone quarry are not part of Solidaridad as they belong to the neighboring municipality of Cozumel. These are the only two mainland locations for the municipality of Cozumel with sizes of and respectively. All of the limestone from Calica is exported to the US, and the quarry has its own docks and also serves visiting cruise ships.

===Orography and hydrography===

Like most of the Yucatan Peninsula, Solidaridad is almost entirely flat with a gentle slope towards the sea, so from west to east, most of the area never reaches an altitude above above sea level.

Like the rest of the peninsula&#x27;s surface the land has a limestone base that does not allow the formation of surface water flows such as rivers and streams, the water instead form flows in underground rivers that sometimes rise to the surface in the cenotes. Lakes and cenotes are the major water bodies of the municipality.

===Communities===
The largest localities (cities, towns, and villages) are:
==History==
Solidaridad is one of the youngest municipalities in the country: it was formed on July 28, 1993, by decree of the State Congress during the administration of Mario Villanueva Madrid. At this time the municipality of Cozumel was split into two, with the mainland section constituting the new municipality of Solidaridad.

On March 13, 2008, Solidaridad was split in two when the new Municipality of Tulum was formed, as a result its land area and population were adjusted.
==Demographics==

The municipality has a population of 159,310 according to the results of the Population and Housing Census of 2010 conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía), of these, 83,468 are men and 75,842 are women. By this time, Tulum Municipality was already separated from Solidaridad.

Currently most of its population are immigrants, mainly from the southeastern states of Mexico; but also, according to the National Institute of Migration, Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Migración de México), the municipality has 12 percent of its population of foreign origin.

<text>Antonio Sánchez (born November 1, 1971) is a Mexican drummer and composer. He is best known for his work with jazz guitarist Pat Metheny and as a composer of the film score for the 2014 film &quot;Birdman&quot;. The score earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and BAFTA Award for Best Film Music; he won a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Score, and the Satellite Award for Best Original Score.

==Early life and education ==
Sánchez was born in Mexico City, Mexico, and started playing drums at the age of five. By his teen years, he had already begun playing professionally. He attained a degree in classical piano from the National Conservatory in 1993 and then moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to study at Berklee College of Music. After he graduated magna cum laude in jazz studies, Sánchez obtained a scholarship for a master&#x27;s degree in jazz improvisation at Boston&#x27;s New England Conservatory of Music. He is the grandson of Mexican actor Ignacio López Tarso.

==Career==

While Sánchez was still at the Conservatory in 1997, his teacher, Danilo Pérez, recommended him to Paquito D&#x27;Rivera for the drum chair in Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s United Nations Orchestra, which led to him touring with the orchestra. Later in 1997, Perez invited Sánchez to be a part of his acoustic trio which resulted in extensive touring, and the recording of the Grammy Award-nominated album &quot;Motherland&quot;. The tour resulted in him being heard by guitarist Pat Metheny who invited Sánchez to join the Pat Metheny Group as its drummer after a series of auditions.

The group recorded two albums with Sánchez. The first one, &quot;Speaking of Now&quot;, won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album in 2003. A DVD, under the same name, documenting the tour has been released. The second album, &quot;The Way Up&quot;, was released in January 2005. Sánchez has been a part of various quartets and trios under Metheny&#x27;s direction. The Pat Metheny Trio (Metheny on guitar, Sánchez on drums, and Christian McBride on bass) released &quot;Day Trip&quot; in January 2008 to wide acclaim among jazz critics. In 2012, he was the drummer on Pat Metheny&#x27;s album &quot;Unity Band&quot;.

In 2006, Sánchez joined the faculty of New York University (NYU). The next year, he recorded his first solo album, &quot;Migration&quot;, on CAM Jazz. The album includes Pat Metheny, Chick Corea, Chris Potter, David Sánchez, and Scott Colley. &quot;All About Jazz&quot; called it &quot;One of the best debuts of 2007.&quot; Sánchez said of the album: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want people to say this is a drummer&#x27;s album...I wanted it to be something that could be from any instrumentalist. I thought in terms of music, not how many solos I got and if I blew enough chops or not. I wanted the music to be very melodic and accessible and with a lot of really good interplay.&quot;

In 2010, Sánchez released his second solo album, &quot;Live in New York at Jazz Standard&quot;, to positive reviews. The double live album was recorded at the Jazz Standard in New York City after a U.S. tour of Antonio&#x27;s band, which included Miguel Zenón on alto saxophone, David Sánchez on tenor saxophone, and Scott Colley on acoustic bass guitar.

The year 2013 marked the release of his third solo album. &quot;New Life&quot; was recorded in January 2012. It includes 8 original compositions and features Thana Alexa on vocals, David Binney on alto saxophone, Donny McCaslin on tenor saxophone, John Escreet on piano and Matt Brewer on bass. All his solo albums have been released under the Cam Jazz label.

In 2014, Sánchez composed the film score for &quot;Birdman&quot;. The soundtrack album was released on October 14, 2014. The score earned him nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, BAFTA Award for Best Film Music, and other nominations; he won the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Score and Satellite Award for Best Original Score. However, he was disqualified to compete for the Academy Award for Best Original Score, since the film also contained a significant amount of classical music.

Sánchez&#x27;s 2017 album, &quot;Bad Hombre,&quot; earned him a Grammy Nomination for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album.

Sánchez continued working with the Pat Metheny band in 2019 as they toured extensively and released an album of new material in 2020 entitled &quot;From This Place&quot;.

Sánchez&#x27;s 2022 album, &quot;SHIFT (Bad Hombre Vol. II),&quot; sees Sánchez joining forces with a diverse range of collaborators, including Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross, Dave Matthews &amp; Pat Metheny, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Meshell Ndegeocello, Kimbra, Lila Downs, Ana Tijoux, Becca Stevens, Silvana Estrada, MARO and Thana Alexa.

==Equipment==
Sánchez plays Yamaha drums, Remo drumheads, and Zildjian cymbals and sticks, as well as LP Percussion exclusively.

<doc id="330647" wikidata="Q234542" url="?curid=330647" title="Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom">
<text>Princess Victoria (Victoria Alexandra Olga Mary; 6 July 1868 – 3 December 1935) was the fourth child and second daughter of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra and the younger sister of King George V.

== Early life and education ==

Victoria Alexandra Olga Maria was born on 6 July 1868 at Marlborough House, London. She was the fourth child of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and his wife Alexandra, Princess of Wales. Victoria&#x27;s father was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Her mother was the eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark. Among those close to her, the princess was known as Toria. From birth, as the granddaughter of the British monarch, she had the title &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Wales&quot;.

Princess Victoria was baptized at Marlborough House on 6 August 1868 by Archibald Campbell Tait, Bishop of London.

== Personal life ==
In 1885, Victoria was a bridesmaid at the wedding of her aunt Princess Beatrice to Prince Henry of Battenberg. She was also a bridesmaid at the wedding of her brother George, Duke of York and Victoria Mary of Teck, the future King and Queen of the United Kingdom.

Princess Victoria was educated at home with her sisters. The princess grew up at Marlborough House and Sandringham under the supervision of tutors. She occasionally spent the summer in Denmark, her mother&#x27;s homeland. In her youth, she was described as &quot;a lively, mischievous girl ... smart, tall and elegant; she had a wonderful sense of humour and was a good friend to everyone; she had big expressive blue eyes; there was no pretense or hint of a high position in her.&quot; Victoria loved horse riding, cycling, reading, listening to music and dancing. The princess&#x27;s particular passion was photography. She compiled several albums of family photographs. Victoria&#x27;s works have been displayed at several different exhibitions. She was very fond of animals. Her favorites were dogs named Sam, Mas and Punchy. For six years Victoria had a tamed pigeon, which she took with her on walks and travels in a small basket.

Victoria maintained friendly relations with her cousins in Russia and Greece. The future Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, who was her first cousin (her mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son), and exactly the same age, was in love with her in his youth. The Tsarevich liked Victoria for her seriousness, thoroughness, and &quot;unfeminine mind.&quot; In 1889, describing the princess, Nicholas told his close friend and brother-in-law, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich: &quot;She is a truly wonderful creature, and the more and deeper you delve into her soul, the clearer you see all her virtues and qualities. I must confess that it is very difficult to figure it out at first, i.e. to learn her view of things and people, but this difficulty is a special charm for me, which I am unable to explain.&quot; The princess also caught the eyes of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, and later, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich was fascinated by her.

Another candidate to seek Victoria&#x27;s hand in marriage was her cousin, Crown Prince Christian of Denmark, who later became Christian X. The princess rejected him, much to the disappointment of her parents. Yet another contender for marriage was the Portuguese king Carlos I. He demanded that Victoria accept the Catholic faith, which did not sit well with her parents. The 5th Earl of Rosebery also attempted to win her attention, in vain. Victoria never married, and her mother was said to be supportive of this decision. 

Victoria was particularly close to her parents, and if she appeared in public, it was usually in their company, as was usual in those days for an unmarried adult woman. The princess accompanied her parents during official events and ceremonies, and helped them in private life. Her first cousin, the Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, remarked in later life that she &quot;felt so very sorry&quot; for Victoria, as she seemed within her family to be &quot;a glorified maid to her mother,&quot; attributing her staying unmarried to a disinclination to oppose her mother. &quot;I&#x27;d something of a rebel in me. Toria had not.&quot;

Close as she was to her parents, the person to whom Victoria was closest was her older brother George, who in 1910 became king and emperor. Throughout their lives, which ended within a month of each other, the king-emperor and his sister maintained a warm relationship. They had similar characters and a mutual sense of humour. When Victoria died in 1935, the king said: &quot;How I will miss our daily phone calls. Nobody had such a sister as I had.&quot; The king died a month after the death of his sister. She was not close to his wife, Queen Mary, née Princess Mary of Teck, whom she described as &quot;terribly boring&quot;. This was attributed to their different characters, education and interests.

== Later years and death ==
Between 22 and 24 March 1905, Princess Victoria, along with her mother, her younger sister Maud (future Queen Maud of Norway) and her cousin / brother-in-law Carl (future Haakon VII, King of Norway), made an official visit to Portugal on the royal yacht HMY &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; following a visit by the Portuguese monarch to the United Kingdom a year prior. On the first day of her arrival, Victoria stayed on the royal yacht due to poor health. Queen Alexandra with her daughter Princess Maud and Prince Carl met with Queen Amelia and Queen Dowager Maria Pia. The next day, accompanied by her sister, Victoria paid a visit to the king, queen and their sons. On 24 March the British guests left for their homeland.

After her father&#x27;s death in 1910, Victoria remained in the shadow of her mother. Queen Alexandra suffered from constant depression and was practically deaf. Victoria accompanied her mother during her visits to various institutions and on holidays. Once, when the dowager queen was unable to attend the charity event Alexandra Rose Day, she sent her daughters Louise and Victoria together, and the latter later recorded in her diary that &quot;it was terrible to be there without dear Mama.&quot; With continuing public hostility toward Germany during World War I, King George V decided to renounce all German titles and honours. He asked all members of the royal family to do the same. The king renamed the ruling dynasty from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor, after his favourite castle. Princess Victoria followed suit and adopted the surname Windsor.

After the death of Queen Alexandra in 1925, Victoria moved to Coppins, in the village of Iver, Buckinghamshire, where she lived until her death. In her final years, Victoria enjoyed listening to music, gardening, and taking an active part in addressing local issues and problems. Victoria became a patron to the young cellist Beatrice Harrison and her sisters May and Margaret, who also studied music, and she paid for Harrison&#x27;s valuable Guarneri cello. Victoria received the Harrison sisters regularly at her home and at Sandringham, and attended concerts at the Wigmore Hall with them. She also commissioned HMV to make her some private recordings in August 1928: the recordings, capturing Victoria at the piano accompanying Beatrice Harrison on the cello and May Harrison on the violin, would many years later be commercially released, though Victoria&#x27;s musicianship would generate mixed reviews.

Other friends of Victoria included members of the Musgrave family, the widowed 5th Earl of Rosebery, and Violet Vivian, a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Alexandra. Lady Musgrave was Victoria&#x27;s lifelong friend and lady-in-waiting. The princess assisted Violet Vivian in the design of the Cestyll Garden near the village of Cemaes on the northwest coast of Anglesey.

Victoria died in the early hours of 3 December 1935 at the age of 67 at her home. She had been in poor health over the previous month, culminating in a severe haemorrhage on 1 December. The State Opening of Parliament, planned for 3 December, was cancelled in response to her death, and instead the already-written King&#x27;s Speech was read to Parliamentarians by the Lord Chancellor without ceremony.

Her funeral took place on 7 December 1935 at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, where she was initially buried. The mourners at the funeral included Victoria&#x27;s brother George V. George himself was in poor health, and his doctor pushed for the funeral service to be shortened; he was unsuccessful, and George&#x27;s final deterioration and death soon after would later be blamed on the physical strain of the long event. Victoria&#x27;s remains were later moved and reburied at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, Windsor Great Park, on 8 January 1936. Her will was sealed in London in 1936. Her estate was valued at £237,455 (or £11.7 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

<doc id="330652" wikidata="Q188942" url="?curid=330652" title="Mullah">
<text>Mullah () is an honorific title for Muslim clergy and mosque leaders. The term is widely used in Iran and Afghanistan and is also used for a person who has higher education in Islamic theology and sharia law. 

The title has also been used in some Mizrahi and Sephardic Jewish communities in reference to the community&#x27;s leadership, especially its religious leadership.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;mullah&quot; is derived from the Persian word &quot;mullā&quot; (), itself borrowed from the Arabic word &quot;mawlā&quot; (), meaning &quot;master&quot; and &quot;guardian&quot;, with mutation of the initial short vowels.

==Usage==

=== Historical usage ===

The term has also been used among Persian Jews, Bukharan Jews, Afghan Jews, and other Central Asian Jews to refer to the community&#x27;s religious and/or secular leadership. In Kaifeng, China, the historic Chinese Jews who managed the synagogue were called &quot;mullahs&quot;.

=== Modern usage ===

It is the term commonly used for village or neighborhood mosque leaders, who may not have high levels of religious education, in large parts of the Muslim world, particularly Iran, Turkey, Caucasus, Central Asia, West Asia, South Asia, Eastern Arabia, the Balkans and the Horn of Africa. In other regions, a different term may be used, such as &quot;imam&quot; in the Maghreb.

In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the title is given to graduates of a madrasa or Islamic school, who are then able to become a mosque leader, a teacher at a religious school, a local judge in a village or town, or to perform religious rituals. A person who is still a student at a madrasa and yet to graduate is a &quot;talib&quot;. The Afghan Taliban was formed in 1994 by men who had graduated from, or at least attended, madrasas. They called themselves &quot;taliban&quot;, the plural of &quot;talib&quot;, or &quot;students&quot;. Many of the leaders of the Taliban were titled &quot;Mullah&quot;, although not all had completed their madrasa education. Someone who goes on to complete postgraduate religious education receives the higher title of Mawlawi.

In Iran, until the early 20th century, the term &quot;mullah&quot; was used in Iranian seminaries to refer to low-level clergy who specialized in telling stories of Ashura, rather than teaching or issuing fatwas. However, in recent years, among Shia clerics, the term &quot;ruhani&quot; (spiritual) has been promoted as an alternative to mullah and &quot;akhoond&quot;, free of pejorative connotations.

==Training and duties==
Ideally, a trained mullah will have studied the traditional Islamic sciences not limited to:
* Classical Arabic
** Nahw (syntax) 
** Sarf (word morphology)
** Balaaghah (rhetoric)
** Shi&#x27;r (poetry)
** Adab (literature)
* Tarikh (history) 
* Islamic law (fiqh)
** Rulings pertaining to their school of jurisprudence and the rulings of other schools of jurisprudence
** The principles of jurisprudence pertaining to their school of jurisprudence and the principles of other schools of jurisprudence
** The evidences of their school of thought for principles and rulings, the evidences of others, how they differ and why
* Islamic traditions (hadith)
** Exegesis
** The principles of exegesis
* Aqidah (Islamic creed)
* Mantiq (logic)
* Ilm-ul-Kalaam (philosophy)
* (Quran)
** The meanings of the Quran
** Exegesis
** the principles and rules of Quranic exegesis
* Tasawwuf (Sufism)

Some mullahs will specialise in certain fields after completing the above foundational studies. Common specialties are:
* Iftah – after which they qualify as a mufti and can issue a fatwa (legal ruling)
* Takhasus fil Hadith – specialisation in hadith studies
* Takhasus fil Aqidah – specialisation in aqidah studies

Such figures often have memorized the Quran and historically would memorise all the books they studied. However in the modern era they instead memorise the founding books of each field (sometimes in the form of poetry to aid memorisation).

Uneducated villagers may frequently classify a literate Muslim with a less than complete Islamic training as their &quot;mullah&quot; or religious cleric. Mullahs with varying levels of training lead prayers in mosques, deliver religious sermons, and perform religious ceremonies such as birth rites and funeral services. They also often teach in a type of Islamic school known as a madrasah. Three kinds of knowledge are applied most frequently in interpreting Islamic texts (i.e. the Quran, hadiths, etc.) for matters of Sharia, i.e., Islamic law.

Mullahs have frequently been involved in politics, but only recently have they served in positions of power, since Shia Islamists seized power in Iran in 1979.

==Dress==

The dress of a Mullah usually consists of a turban ( ), a long coat with sleeves and buttons, similar to a cassock ( ), and a long gown or cloak, open at the front ( ). The &quot;aba&quot; is usually made either of brown wool or of black muslin. It is sleeveless but has holes through which the arms may be inserted. In Shiism, the turban is usually white, but those who claim descent from Muhammad traditionally wear a black turban. Sunni Mullahs generally wear neutral colored turbans, with some sufis choosing green as preferred color.

<text>The flagtails (&#x27; or&#x27; in the Hawaiian language) are a family (Kuhliidae) of centrarchiform ray-finned fish of the Indo-Pacific area. The family consists of about 12 species in one genus, Kuhlia. Most are euryhaline and often found in brackish water, but the genus also includes species restricted to marine or fresh water.

Several species are known as Hawaiian flagtails, particularly &quot;K. sandvicensis&quot; and &quot;K. xenura&quot;.

==Etymology==
The genus &quot;Kuhlia&quot; is named for the German zoologist Heinrich Kuhl (1797–1821).

==Description==
The distinctive characteristic of these fish is a scaly sheath around the dorsal and anal fins. The dorsal fin is deeply notched between the 10 spines and the 9 to 13 soft rays. The opercle has two spines, and the anal fin three. Their bodies are compressed and silvery, and they tend to be small, growing to 50 cm at most.

During the day, they usually school, dispersing at night to feed on free-swimming fish and crustaceans.

==Species==
The currently recognized species in this genus are:
* &quot;Kuhlia caudavittata&quot; 
* &quot;Kuhlia malo&quot; 
* &quot;Kuhlia marginata&quot; (spotted or dark-margined flagtail)
* &quot;Kuhlia mugil&quot; (barred flagtail)
* &quot;Kuhlia munda&quot; (silver flagtail)
* &quot;Kuhlia nutabunda&quot; (Rapanui flagtail)
* &quot;Kuhlia petiti&quot; 
* &quot;Kuhlia rupestris&quot; (rock flagtail, jungle perch)
* &quot;Kuhlia salelea&quot; 
* &quot;Kuhlia sandvicensis&quot; (Hawaiian flagtail)
* &quot;Kuhlia sauvagii&quot; 
* &quot;Kuhlia xenura&quot;

<text>Eliza McCardle Johnson (née McCardle; October 4, 1810 – January 15, 1876) was the first lady of the United States from 1865 to 1869 as the wife of President Andrew Johnson. She also served as the second lady of the United States March 1865 until April 1865 when her husband was vice president. Johnson was relatively inactive as first lady, and she stayed out of public attention for the duration of her husband&#x27;s presidency. She was the youngest first lady to wed, doing so at the age of 16.

Johnson significantly contributed to her husband&#x27;s early career, providing him with an education and encouraging him to strengthen his oratory skills and seek office. Johnson did not participate in the social aspects of politics, however, remaining at home while her husband took office. During the American Civil War, she was forced from her home for her family&#x27;s Unionist loyalties. She was affected by tuberculosis throughout much of her life, and what activity she did choose to undertake was limited due to her health.

Johnson was briefly the second lady of the United States before becoming the first lady, as her husband was vice president until the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. After becoming the first lady, Johnson delegated the role&#x27;s social duties to her daughter Martha Johnson Patterson. Though she only made two public appearances during her tenure as first lady, Johnson was a strong influence on her husband, and he would consult her regularly for advice. Johnson returned to her home of Greeneville, Tennessee with her family after leaving the White House, living a quiet retirement. She died six months after her husband and was buried beside him.

==Early life and marriage==
Eliza McCardle was born in Greeneville, Tennessee on October 4, 1810. She was the only child of John McCardle, a cobbler and innkeeper, and Sarah Phillips. The family moved to Warrensburg, Tennessee while McCardle was young, but they returned to Greeneville following her father&#x27;s death. McCardle was raised by her widowed mother, who financially supported her by weaving and taught her to read and write. McCardle attended school and received a basic education. She is believed to have attended the Rhea Academy in Greenville.

McCardle met Andrew Johnson when his family moved to Greeneville in September 1826. She is said to have first seen him while talking amongst her friends, who began to tease her when she expressed her interest in the tailor&#x27;s apprentice. McCardle and Johnson began courting almost immediately. The Johnsons left the city later that year, and the couple exchanged letters until he returned in 1827. They married on May 17, 1827. Mordecai Lincoln, the cousin once removed of Abraham Lincoln, presided over the nuptials. McCardle was 16-years-old, making her the youngest to marry of all the first ladies of the United States. After marrying, the couple moved into a two room house, where one of the rooms served as a tailor shop.

Eliza Johnson provided her husband much of his formal education, though a common myth suggests that she even taught him to read and write. They had five children together: Martha in 1828, Charles in 1830, Mary in 1832, Robert in 1834, and Frank in 1852. Once they began having children, much of Johnson&#x27;s time was spent tending to the household while her husband operated his tailor shop. In 1831, they purchased a larger home as well as a separate facility for the shop. They moved to a larger home again in 1851.

== Politician&#x27;s wife ==

=== Antebellum years ===
With Eliza&#x27;s encouragement, her husband sought political office. She played a large role in his early political career, assisting him in his education and his oratory skill. As he attained higher political offices, Johnson avoided the social role associated with a politician&#x27;s wife, instead tending to their home. By this point, the household included eight or nine slaves. It is unknown how Johnson felt about owning slaves. As Johnson&#x27;s children came of age, she enjoyed seeing her daughters seek husbands and start families of their own. At the same time, her two older sons became a cause of stress as they were affected by alcoholism.

While at home, Johnson was responsible for managing the family&#x27;s finances, including their many investments. Though she did not accompany her husband when he traveled for his work, she supported him, providing encouragement and helping him with his speeches. She suffered from tuberculosis, causing infirmity. Her health improved and worsened in turn over the following years, but she never fully recovered. She eventually traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1860 with her sons, staying until the American Civil War began the following year.

=== American Civil War ===
During the war, Johnson became an advocate for Unionists that lived in the Confederate States of America. She was forced to move after the Confederate States Army occupied the region. She moved to her daughter Mary&#x27;s farm after the Johnson home was captured by Confederate forces. While initially ordered to vacate the entire region within 36 hours in May 1862, she replied &quot;I cannot comply with the requirement&quot;, and she was granted an additional five months. 

Johnson eventually made the three week journey to Nashville, Tennessee, during which she was harassed and threatened for being the wife of a Unionist senator. The journey severely affected her health, but upon arriving in Nashville she reunited with her husband, who she had not seen in almost a year. She later traveled north, passing through Confederate lines without escort, going to Ohio and Indiana to visit her children. She returned to Nashville in May 1863. The Johnsons&#x27; eldest son, Charles, was killed later that year after being thrown from his horse. She had little reprieve in Nashville, rarely seeing her husband, especially after he began campaigning in the 1864 presidential election.

Johnson&#x27;s husband was sworn in as the Vice President of the United States in March 1865. The following month, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and her husband ascended to the presidency. This had a severe emotional effect on her; in one letter, her daughter Martha described her as &quot;almost deranged&quot; with worry that her husband would be assassinated as well. She also lamented the idea of becoming first lady, effectively rejecting the role.

==First Lady of the United States==
Johnson traveled to Washington with her surviving children, her son-in-law David T. Patterson, and her grandchildren. They arrived on August 6, 1865. After arriving, she chose a room on the second floor directly opposite the president&#x27;s office. Johnson was not able to serve effectively as first lady due to her poor health, and she remained largely confined to her bedroom, leaving the social chores to her daughter Martha. Though she disliked being the president&#x27;s wife, she enjoyed the fact that her entire family all lived together.

Johnson would receive her husband&#x27;s guests at the White House, but she appeared publicly as first lady on only two occasions: a celebration for Queen Emma of Hawaii in 1866 and a children&#x27;s ball for the president&#x27;s sixtieth birthday in 1868. In both instances, she did not rise while receiving guests. She also received many letters from the public while she was the first lady, often asking for political favors or access to the president. Her correspondences were managed by her daughter and the White House staff. Though she was not active publicly, Johnson was able to regularly engage in activities with her family with some assistance.

While living in the White House, Johnson often sewed and knitted, and she was frequently reading. Each day, she would make her way through the White House residence, checking on her husband and the staff or spending time with her grandchildren. She was close to the staff, treating both the white and black servants &quot;as members of the household&quot;. Johnson took up causes of her own, including a financial contribution to orphanages in Baltimore, Maryland, and Charleston, South Carolina. She also managed to travel while she was first lady, visiting nearby cities such as Boston, New York, and Philadelphia in 1867.

Johnson did not have an active role in the politics of her husband&#x27;s administration, though she gave him full support during his presidency, including during his impeachment. She took an interest in the proceedings, and the president would visit her each morning for her advice. She held a strong influence over the president, and he regularly considered her advice. She regularly monitored newspaper coverage of the presidency, clipping stories that she felt deserved the president&#x27;s attention. She sorted them each day, showing him positive stories each night and then negative stories the following morning.

Johnson assisted the president with his speeches as she did in his previous political positions, and she worked to prevent the outbursts caused by his temper. Her fear for her husband&#x27;s safety persisted throughout his presidency, as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln was still in recent memory. Despite her illness, she would still tend to her husband in certain areas, selecting his wardrobe for him and ensuring he was satisfied with the food provided for him. Johnson disliked living in the White House, and she was glad when her husband&#x27;s term ended.

==Later life and death==
The Johnsons returned to Greenville after leaving the White House in March 1869. Their son Robert took his own life the following month. Johnson lived a quieter life after ending her tenure as first lady, often spending her time with her children and grandchildren. She enjoyed a level of independence, sometimes traveling without her husband.Her health declined by the time her husband was elected to the United States Senate in 1875, and she moved in with her daughter Mary. She was widowed shortly afterward on July 31, 1875. Johnson&#x27;s poor health and her grief prevented her from attending the funeral, but she was appointed to execute his estate. She died on January 15, 1876, at the age of 65, and was buried beside her husband in Andrew Johnson National Cemetery.

== Legacy ==

Johnson was one of the least active first ladies, playing little role in the political or social aspects of the White House. Her influence was that of an educator and adviser to her husband. She did not meaningfully change the position of first lady during her tenure. Historians generally describe Johnson as unassuming and unable to fulfill the role of first lady, but also as a capable intellectual partner for her husband. Though her husband&#x27;s reputation declined considerably over the following century, Johnson&#x27;s reputation as first lady remained largely unchanged. Johnson&#x27;s personal papers have been lost, in large part due to the Civil War. Most primary documents associated with her are among her husband&#x27;s papers. In the 1982 Siena College Research Institute poll of historians, Johnson was ranked as the 21st of 42 first ladies.

Johnson returned to the practice common among 19th century first ladies in which she allowed a younger surrogate to perform much of her duties, reestablishing the practice after the highly public tenure of her predecessor Mary Todd Lincoln. She would be the last first lady to invoke illness in this fashion until Ida Saxton McKinley much later. Johnson may have avoided public attention specifically because of the intense criticism levied at her predecessor and the potential for similar criticism given her husband&#x27;s controversial presidency. She may also have feared that she lacked the social talents required of a hostess. By the end of her tenure, she was described as &quot;almost a myth&quot; due to her limited public contact.

<doc id="330662" wikidata="Q284156" url="?curid=330662" title="Joseph Plunkett">
<text>Joseph Mary Plunkett (Irish: &quot;Seosamh Máire Pluincéid&quot;; 21 November 1887 – 4 May 1916) was an Irish republican, poet and journalist. As a leader of the 1916 Easter Rising, he was one of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. Plunkett married Grace Gifford in 1916, seven hours before his execution.

==Background==
Plunkett was born at 26 Upper Fitzwilliam Street in one of Dublin&#x27;s most affluent districts. Both his parents came from wealthy backgrounds, and his father, George Noble Plunkett, had been made a papal count.

Plunkett contracted tuberculosis (TB) at a young age and spent part of his youth in the warmer climates of the Mediterranean and North Africa. He spent time in Algiers where he studied Arabic literature and language and composed poetry in Arabic. He was educated at the Catholic University School (CUS) and by the Jesuits at Belvedere College in Dublin and later at Stonyhurst College, in Lancashire, England where he acquired some military knowledge from the Officers&#x27; Training Corps. Throughout his life, Joseph Plunkett took an active interest in Irish heritage and the Irish language, and also studied Esperanto. Plunkett was one of the founders of the Irish Esperanto Association in 1907. He joined the Gaelic League and began studying with Thomas MacDonagh, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. The two were both poets with an interest in theatre, and both were early members of the Irish Volunteers, joining their provisional committee. Plunkett&#x27;s interest in Irish nationalism spread throughout his family, notably to his younger brothers George and John, as well as his father, who allowed his property in Kimmage, south Dublin, to be used as a training camp for young men who wished to escape conscription in Britain during the First World War.

==IRB involvement==

Sometime in 1915, Joseph Plunkett joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood and soon after was sent to Germany to meet with Roger Casement, who was negotiating with the German government on behalf of Ireland. Casement&#x27;s role as emissary was self-appointed, and, as he was not a member of the IRB, that organisation&#x27;s leadership wished to have one of their own contact Germany to negotiate German aid for an uprising the following year. He was seeking (but not limiting himself to) a shipment of arms. Casement, on the other hand, spent most of his energies recruiting Irish prisoners of war in Germany to form a brigade to fight instead for Ireland. Some nationalists in Ireland saw this as a fruitless endeavour and preferred to seek weapons. Plunkett successfully got a promise of a German arms shipment to coincide with the Rising.

According to Ernest Blythe, Plunkett&#x27;s republicanism did not prevent him from suggesting, at a briefing of Irish Volunteer organisers in January 1915, that in certain circumstances it would be in Irish interests for a German Catholic prince to be crowned king of Ireland, nor did anyone present object. During the Easter Rising, Plunkett and Patrick Pearse argued in a conversation with Desmond Fitzgerald that it would be beneficial for Prince Joachim of Prussia to be crowned king.

==Easter Rising==
Plunkett was one of the original members of the IRB Military Committee that was responsible for planning the Easter Rising, and it was largely his plan that was followed. Shortly before the rising was to begin, Plunkett was hospitalised following a turn for the worse in his health. He had an operation on his neck glands (probably goiter) days before Easter and had to struggle out of bed to take part in what was to follow. Still bandaged, he took his place in the General Post Office with several other of the rising&#x27;s leaders such as Patrick Pearse and Tom Clarke, though his health prevented him from being active.

Margaret Skinnider recalls that during Easter Week he was &quot;pale and weak&quot; and &quot;looked like death&quot;.

His &quot;aide de camp&quot; and bodyguard was the then 25-year-old Michael Collins.

==Marriage and execution==
Following the surrender, Plunkett was held in Kilmainham Gaol, and faced a court martial. Just after the rising on the 3rd of May, Thomas McDonagh was executed and Grace received news that Joseph was to be executed the following morning. Grace purchased a ring from a jeweller in Dublin and persuaded a priest to let her marry Joseph before his execution. Grace and Joseph were married in the prison chapel in Kilmainham jail, just hours before his death. There were only two witnesses (guards John Smith and John Lockerby) in addition to the priest. Grace was awoken at 2 am and taken back to the jail where they had their final meeting. With a guard counting down the 10 minutes they had together, Joseph was executed soon after along with the other 13 leaders.

==Aftermath/Legacy==

His brothers George Oliver Plunkett and Jack Plunkett joined him in the Easter Rising and later became important IRA men. His father&#x27;s cousin, Horace Plunkett, was a Protestant and unionist who sought to reconcile unionists and nationalists. Horace Plunkett&#x27;s home was burned down by the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Civil War.

Plunkett named his sister, Geraldine, the literary executor of his will. She published a volume of his poetry a month after his execution in June 1916.

The main railway station in Waterford City is named after him as was Joseph Plunkett Tower in Ballymun which has since been demolished. Plunkett barracks in the Curragh Camp, County Kildare is also named after him.

==In popular culture==
The Irish ballad &quot;Grace&quot;, written by Seán and Frank O&#x27;Meara, is a monologue of Plunkett expressing his love to Grace and his love for the cause of Irish independence in the small hours before his execution. The ballad has been notably covered by Jim McCann.

He is also mentioned in the Irish rebel song &quot;Seán South of Garryowen&quot;.

American composer Florence Turner-Maley used Plunkett&#x27;s text in her song &quot;I See Him Everywhere.&quot;

His religious poem &quot;I See His Blood upon the Rose&quot; is well-known in Ireland.

<doc id="330666" wikidata="Q261179" url="?curid=330666" title="7th Infantry Division (United States)">
<text>The 7th Infantry Division is a non-deployable administrative headquarters of the United States Army based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. It is charged with maintaining the capability of two Stryker infantry brigade combat teams, a combat aviation brigade, and a Division Artillery Unit, as well as preparing units for several U.S. Army Pacific yearly exercises. The 7th Infantry Division is the only active-duty multi-component division headquarters in the Army. Major General Michelle A. Schmidt commands the division. The 7th Infantry Division is also home to two of the Army&#x27;s newest enabling battlefield capabilities, the Multi Domain Task Force and the Intelligence, Information, Cyber, Electronic Warfare and Space Capabilities, or I2CEWS battalion.

The division was first activated in December 1917 in World War I, and has been based at Fort Ord, California for most of its history. Although elements of the division saw brief active service in World War I, it is best known for its participation in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II where it took heavy casualties engaging the Imperial Japanese Army in the Aleutian Islands, Leyte, and Okinawa. Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the division was stationed in Japan and Korea, and with the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 was one of the first units in action. It took part in the Inchon Landings and the advance north until Chinese forces counter-attacked and almost overwhelmed the scattered division. The 7th later went on to fight in the Battle of Pork Chop Hill and the Battle of Old Baldy.

After the Korean War ended, the division was headquartered at Camp Casey with artillery units supporting the 1st Cavalry Division just south of the Korean Demilitarized Zone until the mid-1960s. In the late 1980s, it briefly saw action overseas in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras and Operation Just Cause in Panama. In the early 1990s, it provided domestic support to the civil authorities in Operation Green Sweep and during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. In 1994 the division was inactivated with a few units transferring to Fort Lewis and Fort Ord closing. In June 1999 the 7th was reactivated at Fort Carson, Colorado and comprised three National Guard brigades. The 1st Battalion, 162d Infantry of the Oregon Army National Guard was attached to the 7th Infantry Division and deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2004. The division&#x27;s final role was as a training and evaluation unit for Army National Guard brigades, which it undertook until its inactivation in 2006.

On 26 April 2012, the Department of Defense announced the reactivation of the 7th Infantry Division headquarters supporting the mission of I Corps.

==History==
===World War I===
==== Activation and movement to France ====
The War Department ordered the formation of the 7th Division on 6 December 1917 at Camp Wheeler, near Macon, Georgia. The nucleus of the division was formed by Regular Army units stationed at Camp Wheeler (8th Field Artillery), Camp Greenleaf (22nd, 34th, 35th, and 36th Ambulance Companies and Field Hospitals), and Chickamauga Park (55th and 56th Infantry and 80th Field Artillery), Georgia, Fort Bliss (34th and 64th Infantry), Camp Logan (79th Field Artillery), and Fort Sam Houston (5th Engineer Regiment), Texas, Fort Sill, Oklahoma (8th Field Artillery), and Camp Vail, Vermont (10th Field Signal Battalion). Regular Army officers and graduates of the First and Second Officers&#x27; Training Camps formed the commissioned personnel of the unit, and Brigadier General Charles H. Barth assumed command on 1 January 1918. Systematic training began in the spring and was continued through the summer despite many transfers. In May and June 1918, 20,000 new men joined the division from Camp Wheeler, Camp Travis, Texas, and Columbus Barracks, Ohio, the majority hailing from Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, and Pennsylvania.

On 18 July 1918, the division moved to ports of embarkation as it prepared to deploy to Europe as a part of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). The unit arrived at Hoboken, New Jersey and in New York, via Camp Merritt, where additional replacements joined the unit. The majority of the unit sailed to Brest, France. The 7th Supply Train and the 7th Train Headquarters and Military Police sailed for Bordeaux, France. The units began to arrive in France on 26 July with the last units arriving on 3 September 1918. Most of the division sailed to Europe aboard the SS &quot;Leviathan&quot;.

==== Training in France ====
From the period of 17 August to October 9, the division conducted final training and preparation to enter the line in the Ancy-le-Franc Training Area. Some soldiers from the unit were sent to the 4th and 26th Divisions as replacements for losses. From the period of 2 September through the 14th the unit was under the administrative control of the VI Corps.

==== World War I Combat ====
While on the Western Front, the 7th Division did not see action at full divisional strength, though its infantry and reconnaissance elements did engage German forces. On 11 October 1918, it first came under shell fire and later, at Saint-Mihiel, came under chemical attack. Elements of the 7th probed up toward Prény near the Moselle River, capturing positions and driving German forces out of the region. It was at this time that the division first received its shoulder sleeve insignia.

From the period of 10 October until the end of the war on 11 November, the division, minus their artillery occupied and conducted local engagements in the Puvenelle Sector (Lorraine). On 10 October 1918, the division relieved the 90th Division on the front with a front line from Sablière, Vandières (incl), Côte 327, north edge of Bois des Rappes, la Souleuvre Fme, 1½ km south of Rembercourt-sur-Mad. The 92nd Division was on the right and the 37th Division was on the left. On 16 October, the 28th Division moved in on the left of the 7th Division. Several days later, on 23 October, the 92nd Division (VI Corps) occupied the sector on the. Three days later on 26 October the sector was reduced by moving the east boundary to a line between Villers-sous-Prény and Prény (both incl). Elements of the 92nd Division relieved the 56th Infantry Regiment. On 29 October, the sector was extended west to a line from Xammes to Charey, with the 64th Infantry relieving elements of the 28th Division, on a front along the eastern edge of Bois de Blainchamp, northern edge of Bois de Hailbat, eastern edge of Bois du Rupt, northern edge of Bois de la Montagne.

During this period in early November, the 7th Division began preparing for an assault on the Hindenburg Line as part of the Second Army. The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre plain, but the main assault was never conducted as hostilities ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the Armistice with Germany.

On 1 November the division conducted local attacks and established outposts at Bois de Trou-de-la-Haie and Bois de Grand-Fontaine. From 9 November through 11th the division executes local attacks and makes gains along the front. On 9 November the division assumes temporary occupation of a hill west of Prény. On 10 November, Hill 323 (1 km southeast of Rembercourt) is occupied. On 11 November, the line is established from 310.2 to 287.1 in the Bois de Grand-Fontaine, the quarry near 278.7, west of Rembercourt, and the small woods ¼ km south of Mon Plaisir Fme.

During its 33 days on the front line, the 7th Division suffered 1,709 casualties, including 204 killed in action and 1,505 wounded in action and was awarded a campaign streamer for Lorraine. The division then served on occupation duties as it began preparations to return to the United States.

==== Order of battle ====

===Interwar period===

The 7th Division arrived at Camp Mills, New York, 20 June 1919, after completing 6 months of training at the Colombey-les-Belles Training Area in France. On arrival, emergency period personnel were discharged from the service at Camp Mills. The division proceeded to Camp Funston, Fort Riley, Kansas, arrived 29 June, and remained there until July 1920. The division was transferred to Camp George G. Meade, Maryland, in July 1920 for permanent station. As a part of the War Department&#x27;s decision to maintain only three fully-active stateside infantry divisions, the 7th Division was inactivated, less the 14th Infantry Brigade and several smaller units, on 22 September 1921 at Camp Meade. Concurrently, the inactivated units were assigned active associate units for mobilization purposes. The 7th Division was allotted to the Seventh Corps Area for mobilization responsibility and assigned to the VII Corps. Fort Snelling, Minnesota, was designated as the mobilization and training station for the division upon reactivation. During the period 1921–39, the 7th Division was represented by the 14th Infantry Brigade and other assorted active elements that formed the base force from which the division would be reactivated in the event of war. Additionally, most of the inactive elements were organized by mid-1927 as &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; (RAI) units with Organized Reserve personnel.

The active elements of the division maintained habitual training relationships with divisional RAI units, as well as with those of the VII Corps, XVII Corps, and the 88th, 89th, and 102nd Divisions. The RAI and Reserve units often trained with the active elements of the division during summer training camps usually conducted at Forts Riley and Leavenworth, Kansas, Fort Crook, Nebraska, or Fort Snelling. The 3rd and 17th Infantry Regiments also supported the Reserve units’ conduct of the Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps held at Fort Leavenworth and Fort Des Moines, Iowa. The 14th Infantry Brigade, reinforced by the active elements of the 7th Tank Company, 9th and 14th Field Artillery Regiments, and 7th Quartermaster Regiment, held maneuvers in those years when funds were available, at Fort Riley or Camp Ripley, Minnesota. During these maneuvers, the 7th Division was occasionally formed in a provisional status to exercise division-level command and control procedures. The division headquarters was also provisionally formed on 21 July 1937 for the August 1937 Fourth Army maneuvers at Camp Ripley. For that maneuver, the division (14th Infantry Brigade as the nucleus) was reinforced by the Minnesota National Guard’s 92nd Infantry Brigade, in addition to the other active divisional elements.

===World War II===
On 1 July 1940, the 7th Division was formally reactivated at Camp Ord, California, under the command of Major General Joseph W. Stilwell. As the Regular Army was still seriously understrength, most of the early troops in the division were conscripted as a part of the United States&#x27; first peacetime military draft. The 7th Division was assigned to III Corps of the Fourth United States Army, and transferred to Longview, Washington, in August 1941 to participate in tactical maneuvers. Following this training, the division moved back to Fort Ord, California, where it was located when the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor caused the United States to declare war. The formation proceeded almost immediately to San Jose, California, arriving 11 December 1941 to help protect the west coast and allay civilian fears of invasion. The 53rd Infantry Regiment was relieved of assignment to the 7th Division and replaced with the 159th Infantry Regiment, newly deployed from the California Army National Guard. For the early parts of the war, the division participated mainly in construction and training roles. Subordinate units also practiced boat loading at the Monterey Wharf and amphibious assault techniques at the Salinas River in California.

On 9 April 1942, the division was formally redesignated as the 7th Motorized Division and transferred to Camp San Luis Obispo on 24 April 1942. Three months later, divisional training commenced in the Mojave Desert in preparation for its planned deployment to the African theater. It was again designated the 7th Infantry Division on 1 January 1943, when the motorized equipment was removed from the unit and it became a light infantry division once more, as the Army eliminated the motorized division concept fearing it would be logistically difficult and that the troops were no longer needed in North Africa. The 7th Infantry Division began rigorous amphibious assault training under US Marines from the Fleet Marine Force, before being deployed to fight in the Pacific theater instead of Africa. USMC General Holland Smith oversaw the unit&#x27;s training.

====Aleutian Islands====


Elements of the 7th Infantry Division first saw combat in the amphibious assault on Attu Island, the westernmost Japanese entrenchment in the Aleutian islands chain of Alaska. Elements landed on 11 May 1943, spearheaded by the 17th Infantry Regiment. The initial landings were unopposed, but Japanese forces mounted a counteroffensive the next day, and the 7th Infantry Division fought an intense battle over the tundra against strong Japanese resistance. The division was hampered by its inexperience, lack of winter clothing, and poor weather and terrain conditions, but was eventually able to coordinate an effective attack. The fight for the island culminated in a battle at Chichagof Harbor, when the division destroyed all Japanese resistance on the island on 29 May, after a suicidal Japanese bayonet charge. During its first fight of the war, 549 soldiers of the division were killed, while killing 2,351 Japanese and taking 28 prisoners. After American forces secured the island chain, the 159th Infantry Regiment was ordered to stay, and the 184th Infantry Regiment took its place as the 7th Division&#x27;s third infantry regiment. The 184th Infantry remained with the division until the end of the war. The 159th Infantry Regiment stayed on the island for some time longer until returning to the Lower 48. The 159th Infantry Regiment was then subsequently sent to Europe, in early 1945 and assigned to the 106th Infantry Division.

American forces then began preparing to move against nearby Kiska island, termed Operation Cottage, the final fight in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. In August 1943, elements of the 7th Infantry Division took part in an amphibious assault on Kiska with a brigade from the 6th Canadian Infantry Division, only to find the island deserted by the Japanese. It was later discovered that the Japanese had withdrawn their 5,000-soldier garrison during the night of 28 July, under cover of fog.

====Marshall Islands====

After the campaign, the division moved to Hawaii where it trained in new amphibious assault techniques on the island of Maui, before returning to Schofield Barracks on Oahu for brief leave. It was reassigned to V Amphibious Corps, a US Marine Corps command. The division left Pearl Harbor on 22 January 1944, for an offensive on Japanese territory. On 30 January 1944, the division landed on islands in the Kwajalein Atoll in conjunction with the 4th Marine Division, code named Operation Flintlock. The 7th Division landed on the namesake island while the 4th Marine Division forces struck the outlying islands of Roi and Namur. The division made landfall on the western beaches of the island at 09:30 on 1 February. It advanced halfway through the island by nightfall the next day, and reached the eastern shore at 1335 hours on 4 February, having wrested the island from the Japanese. The victory put V Amphibious Corps in control of all 47 islands in the atoll. The 7th Infantry Division suffered 176 killed and 767 wounded. On 7 February, the division departed the atoll and returned to Schofield Barracks.

Elements took part in the capture of Engebi in the Eniwetok Atoll on 18 February 1944, code named Operation Catchpole. Because of the speed and success of the attack on Kwajalein, the attack was undertaken several months ahead of schedule. After a week of fighting, the division secured the islands of the atoll. The division then returned to Hawaii to continue training. There, in June 1944, General Douglas MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt personally reviewed the division.

====Leyte====
The 7th Infantry Division left Hawaii on 11 October, heading for Leyte and include the Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were aided against the Japanese. At this time it was under the command of XXIV Corps of the Sixth United States Army. On 20 October 1944, the division made an assault landing at Dulag, Leyte, initially only encountering light resistance. Following a defeat at sea on 26 October, the Japanese launched a large, uncoordinated counteroffensive on the Sixth Army. After heavy fighting, the 184th Infantry secured airstrips at Dulag, while the 17th Infantry secured San Pablo, and the 32nd Infantry took Buri. The 17th Infantry troops moved north to take Dagami on 29 October, in intense jungle warfare that produced high casualties. The division then shifted to the west coast of Leyte on 25 November and attacked north toward Ormoc, securing Valencia on 25 December. An amphibious landing by the 77th Infantry Division effected the capture of Ormoc on 31 December 1944. The 7th Infantry Division joined in the occupation of the city, and engaged the 26th Japanese Infantry Division, which had been holding up the advance of the 11th Airborne Division. The 7th Division&#x27;s attack was successful in allowing the 11th Airborne Division to move through, however, Japanese forces proved difficult to drive out of the area. As such, operations to secure Leyte continued until early February 1945. Afterward, the division began training for an invasion of the Ryukyu island chain throughout March 1945. It was relieved from the Sixth Army and the Philippine Commonwealth military, which went on to attack Luzon.

====Okinawa====

The division was reassigned to XXIV Corps, Tenth United States Army, a newly formed command, and began preparations for the assault on Okinawa. The Battle of Okinawa began on 1 April 1945, L-Day, when the 7th Infantry Division participated in an assault landing south of Hagushi, Okinawa alongside the 96th Infantry Division, and the 1st, and 6th Marine Divisions. of III Amphibious Corps. These divisions spearheaded an assault that would eventually land 250,000 men ashore. The 7th Division quickly moved to Kadena, taking its airfield, and drove from the west to the east coast of the island on the first day. The division then moved south, encountering stiff resistance from fortifications at Shuri a few days later. The Japanese had moved 90 tanks, much of their artillery, and heavy weapons away from the beaches and into this region. Eventually, XXIV Corps destroyed the defenses after a 51-day battle in the hills of southern Okinawa, which was complicated by harsh weather and terrain. During the operation, the division was bombarded with tens of thousands of rounds of field artillery fire, encountering Japanese armed with spears as it continued its fight across the island. Japanese also fought using irregular warfare techniques, relying on hidden cave systems, snipers, and small-unit ambushes to delay the advancing 7th Infantry Division. After the fight, the division began capturing large numbers of Japanese prisoners for the first time in the war, due to low morale, high casualties, and poor equipment. It fought for five continuous days to secure areas around the Nakagusuku Wan and Skyline Ridge. The division also secured Hill 178 in the fighting. It then moved to Kochi Ridge, securing it after a two-week battle. After 39 days of continuous fighting, the 7th Infantry Division was sent into reserve, having suffered heavy casualties.

After the 96th Infantry Division secured Conical Hill, the 7th Infantry Division returned to the line. It pushed into positions on the southern Ozato Mura hills, where Japanese resistance was heaviest. It was placed on the extreme left flank of the Tenth Army, taking the Ghinen peninsula, Sashiki, and Hanagusuku, fending off a series of Japanese counterattacks. Despite heavy Japanese resistance and prolonged bad weather, the division continued its advance until 21 June 1945, when the battle ended, having seen 82 days of combat. The island and surrendering troops were secured by the next day. During the Battle of Okinawa, the soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division killed between 25,000 and 28,000 Japanese soldiers and took 4,584 prisoners. Balanced against this, the 7th Division suffered 2,340 killed and 6,872 wounded for a total of 9,212 battle casualties during 208 days of combat. The division was slated to participate in Operation Downfall as a part of XXIV Corps under the First United States Army, but these plans were scrapped after the Japanese surrendered following the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

During World War II, soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division were awarded three Medals of Honor, 26 Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, 982 Silver Star Medals, 33 Legion of Merit Medals, 50 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, 3,853 Bronze Star Medals, and 178 Air Medals. The division received four campaign streamers and a Philippine Presidential Unit Citation during the war. The three Medals of Honor were awarded to Leonard C. Brostrom, John F. Thorson, and Joe P. Martinez.

====Occupation of Japan====
A few days after V-J Day, the division moved to Korea to accept the surrender of the Japanese Army in South Korea. After the war, the division served as an occupation force in Korea and Japan. Seven thousand, five hundred members of the unit returned to the United States, and the 184th Infantry Regiment was reassigned to the California Army National Guard, cutting the division to half its combat strength. To replace it, the 31st Infantry Regiment was assigned to the division. The 7th Infantry Division remained on occupation duty in Korea patrolling the 38th parallel until 1948, when it was reassigned to occupation duty in Japan, in charge of northern Honshū and all of Hokkaido. During this time, the US Army underwent a drastic reduction in size. At the end of World War II, it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, the 7th Infantry Division was one of only 10 active divisions in the force. It was one of four understrength divisions on occupation duty in Japan alongside the 1st Cavalry Division, 24th Infantry Division, and 25th Infantry Division, all under control of the Eighth United States Army.

===Korean War===
At the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the 7th Infantry Division commander, Major General David G. Barr, assembled the division at Camp Fuji near Mount Fuji. The division was already depleted due to post-war shortages of men and equipment and further depleted as it sent large numbers of reinforcements to strengthen the 25th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division, which were sent into combat in South Korea in July. The division was reduced to 9,000 men, half of its wartime strength. To replenish the ranks of the understrength division, the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) assigned over 8,600 Korean soldiers to the division. The Colombian Battalion was at times attached to the division. With the addition of priority reinforcements from the US, the division strength was eventually increased to 25,000 when it entered combat. Also fighting with the 7th Infantry Division for much of the war were members of the three successive Kagnew Battalions sent by Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia as part of the UN forces.
The division paired with the 1st Marine Division under US X Corps to participate in the Inchon Landing, code named Operation Chromite. The two divisions would be supported by the US 3rd Infantry Division in reserve. Supported by 230 ships of the US Navy, X Corps began landing at Inchon on 15 September 1950, catching the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) by surprise. The 7th Infantry Division began landing on 18 September, after the 1st Marine Division, securing its right flank. X Corps quickly advanced to Seoul and the 1st Marine Division attacked the 20,000 defenders of the city from the north and southwest, while the 7th Infantry Division&#x27;s 32nd Infantry Regiment attacked from the southeast. The 31st Infantry followed behind. Seoul fell to X Corps after suffering moderate casualties, particularly for the Marines. The division then began advancing south to cut off KPA supply routes. The 32nd Infantry crossed the Han River on 25 September to create a bridgehead, and the next day, the division advanced to Osan south of Seoul and linked up with the 1st Cavalry Division of Eighth United States Army which had broken out from the Pusan perimeter starting on 16 September and then began a general offensive northward against crumbling KPA opposition. Radio miscommunication and attack from nearby KPA forces caused a miscommunication, the soldiers of the 1st Cavalry and 7th Infantry briefly engaged in a small-arms firefight with one another, unable to communicate. Seoul was liberated one day later with the help of air assets from the 1st Cavalry Division. The combined forces of the Eighth Army cut off and captured retreating KPA forces. X Corps was kept separate from the rest of the Eighth Army to avoid placing a burden on the logistical system. As part of the UN offensive into North Korea 7th Division withdrew to Pusan to conduct another amphibious assault on the east coast of North Korea. The entire battle for Inchon and Seoul cost the division 106 killed, 411 wounded and 57 missing American soldiers, and 43 killed, 102 wounded South Korean soldiers. The Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their first attacks in late October.

The 7th Infantry Division began landing at Wonsan on 26 October, and Iwon on 29 October. The landing was delayed due to the presence of mines, and by the time X Corps came ashore, ROK forces moving overland had already occupied the ports. The division advanced to Hyesanjin, on the China–North Korea border by the Yalu River, one of the northernmost advances for UN soldiers of the war. Much of X Corps followed behind. On 21 November, the 17th Infantry reached the banks of the Yalu River. The advance went quickly for the 7th Infantry Division and ROK troops while the Marines were not able to advance as quickly. The division halted its advance until 24 November while other units of the Eighth Army&#x27;s IX Corps and ROK II Corps caught up and supply lines were established. During this time, the 7th Division&#x27;s regiments were spread out on the front line. The 31st Infantry Regiment remained at the Chosin Reservoir with the 1st Marine Division while the 32nd and 17th Infantry Regiments were much further to the northeast, closer to ROK I Corps. It was during this time that the division was served by a new type of unit, the 1st Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (M.A.S.H.).

====Chinese intervention====

The UN forces renewed their offensive on 24 November before being stopped by the PVA Second Phase Offensive starting on 25 November with attacks on Eighth Army&#x27;s IX Corps and ROK II Corps in the west and X Corps in the east. X Corps found itself under attack from the PVA 20th, 26th and 27th Field Armies, commanding a total of 12 divisions. During the furious action that followed, the 7th Infantry Division&#x27;s spread out regiments were unable to resist the overwhelming PVA forces. Three of the division&#x27;s infantry battalions were attacked from all sides the next day. 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry (nicknamed Task Force Faith) was trapped with two other battalions by the PVA 80th and 81st Divisions from the 27th Field Army. In the subsequent Battle of Chosin Reservoir, the three battalions were destroyed by overwhelming PVA forces suffering over 2,000 casualties. The 31st Infantry suffered heavy casualties trying to fight back the PVA forces further north, but the 17th Infantry was spared of heavy attack, retreating along the Korean coastline, out of range of the offensive. By the time X Corps ordered a retreat, most of the 7th Infantry Division, save the 17th Infantry Regiment, had suffered 40 percent casualties. The scattered elements of the division saw repeated attacks as they attempted to withdrawal to the port of Hungnam in December 1950. These attacks cost the division another 100 killed before it was evacuated on 21 December. The division suffered 2,657 killed and 354 wounded during the retreat. Most of the dead were members of Task Force Faith.

The division returned to the front lines in early 1951, spearheaded by the 17th Infantry, which had suffered the fewest casualties from the PVA offensive. Division elements advanced through Tangyang in South Korea, and blocking PVA offensives from the northwest. The division reached full strength and saw action around Chechon, Chungju, and Pyeongchang as part of an effort to push the KPA and PVA forces back above the 38th Parallel and away from Seoul. The 7th Infantry Division engaged in a series of successful &quot;limited objective&quot; attacks in the early weeks of February, a series of small unit attacks and ambushes between the two sides. It would continue slowly advancing and clearing enemy hilltop positions through April. By April the entire Eighth Army was advancing north as one line stretching across the peninsula, reaching the 38th Parallel by May. The division, now assigned to IX Corps, then assaulted and fought a fierce three-day battle culminating with the recapture of the terrain that had been lost near the Hwachon Reservoir just over the 38th Parallel in North Korea. In capturing the town bordering on the reservoir it cut off thousands of PVA/KPA troops. The division fought on the front lines until June 1951 when it was assigned to the reserve for a brief rest and refitting.

====Stalemate====
When the division returned to the lines in October, after another assignment in reserve, it moved to the Heartbreak Ridge sector recently vacated by the 2nd Infantry Division, where it was supported by the 3rd Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division. During this new deployment the division fought in the Battle for Heartbreak Ridge, to take an area of staging grounds for the PVA/KPA armies. It remained static in the region until 23 February 1952 when it was sent into reserve and relieved by the 25th Infantry Division. The next year saw the 7th Division engaged in an extended campaign for nearby land, the Battle of Old Baldy. The 7th Division continued to defend &quot;Line Missouri&quot; through September 1952, though it became known as the &quot;Static Line&quot; as UN forces made few meaningful gains in the time.
The 7th Infantry Division&#x27;s Operation Showdown launched in the early morning hours of 14 October 1952, with the 31st Infantry and 32nd Infantry at the head of the attack. The target of the assault was the Triangle Hill complex northeast of Kumhwa. The 7th Infantry Division remained in the Triangle Hill area until the end of October, when it was relieved by the 25th Infantry Division. The 7th Infantry Division was highly praised by commanders for its tenacity through the fight.

The division continued patrol activity around Old Baldy and Pork Chop Hill into 1953, digging tunnels and building a network of outposts and bunkers on and around the hill. In April, the KPA began stepping up offensive operations against UN forces. During the Battle of Porkchop Hill, the PVA 67th and 141st Divisions overran Pork Chop Hill using massed infantry and artillery fire. The hill had been under the control of the 31st Infantry. The 31st counterattacked with reinforcements from the 17th Infantry and recaptured the area the next day. On 6 July the PVA/KPA launched a determined attack against Pork Chop resulting in five days of fierce fighting with few meaningful results. By the end of July, five infantry battalions from the 31st and 17th were defending the hill, while a PVA division was in position to attack it. During this standoff, the UN ordered the 7th Infantry Division to retreat from the hill in preparation for an armistice, which would end major hostilities.

During the Korean War, the division saw a total of 850 days of combat, suffering 15,126 casualties, including 3,905 killed in action and 10,858 wounded. For the next few years, the division remained on defensive duty along the 38th parallel, under the command of the Eighth Army. Thirteen members of the division received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the Korean War: Charles H. Barker, Raymond Harvey, Einar H. Ingman Jr., William F. Lyell, Joseph C. Rodriguez, Richard Thomas Shea, Daniel D. Schoonover, Jack G. Hanson, Ralph E. Pomeroy, Edward R. Schowalter Jr., Benjamin F. Wilson, Don C. Faith Jr., and Anthony T. Kahoʻohanohano.

===Cold War===
From 1953 to 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Its main garrison was Camp Casey, South Korea. On 1 July 1963, the division was reorganized as a Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD). Three Brigade Headquarters were activated and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions. The division&#x27;s former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 2nd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. The 14th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division In 1965 the division received its distinctive unit insignia, which alluded to its history during the Korean War.
In October 1974 the 7th reactivated at its former garrison, Fort Ord. The unit did not see any action in Vietnam or during the post-war era, but was tasked to keep a close watch on South American developments. It trained at Fort Ord, Camp Roberts, Fort Hunter Liggett and Fort Irwin. On 1 October 1985 the division was redesignated as the 7th Infantry Division (Light), organized again as a light infantry division. It was the first US division specially designed as such. The various battalions of the 31st, and 32nd regiments moved from the division, replaced by battalions from other regiments, including battalions from the 21st Infantry Regiment, the 27th Infantry Regiment, and the 9th Infantry Regiment. The 27th and 9th infantry regiments participated in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras.

In 1989 the 7th Infantry Division participated in Operation Just Cause in Panama, briefly occupying the country in conjunction with the 82nd Airborne Division. Elements of the 7th Infantry Division landed in the northern areas of Colón Province, Panama, securing the Coco Solo Naval Station, Fort Espinar, France Field, and Colón while the 82nd Airborne and US Marines fought in the more heavily populated southern region. Once Panama City was under US control, the 82nd quickly re-deployed and left the city under the control of the 7th Division&#x27;s 9th Infantry Regiment until after the capture of Manuel Noriega. It suffered four killed and three wounded in the operation.

In 1991 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closing of Fort Ord due to the escalating cost of living on the central California coastline. By 1994, Fort Ord closed and the 7th Infantry Division subsequently relocated to Fort Lewis, Washington. Elements of the division including the 2nd Brigade participated in one final mission in the United States before inactivation; quelling the 1992 Los Angeles riots, as part of Operation Garden Plot. The division&#x27;s soldiers patrolled the streets of Los Angeles to act as crowd control and supported the Los Angeles Police Department and California Army National Guard in preventing the violence from rampaging throughout Los Angeles County. It was part of a force of 3,500 federal troops called into the city.

In 1993 the division was slated to be inactivated as part of the post-Cold War drawdown of the US Army. The 1st Brigade relocated to Fort Lewis in 1993 and was reflagged on 15 August 1995 as the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division; while the 2nd Brigade and the 3rd Brigade of the 7th was inactivated at Fort Ord. The division headquarters was formally inactivated on 16 June 1994 at Fort Lewis.

===National Guard training command and Fort Carson===
At the end of the Cold War, the US Army considered new options for the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so they could not be deployed as divisions, however their active duty status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.

The headquarters company of the 7th Infantry Division (Light) formally reactivated on 4 June 1999, at Fort Carson, Colorado, as the first Active Component/Reserve Component division. The reserve formations that made up the 7th Infantry Division included the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the Arkansas National Guard, the 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the Oregon National Guard and the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the Oklahoma National Guard. Fort Carson became the new headquarters for the division.

The division headquarters also provided training assistance in preparation for small-scale National Guard operations, Joint Readiness Training Center rotations, leadership training for National Guard commanders, and annual summer training for the three brigades. As a part of this commitment, the 7th Infantry Division headquarters would deploy a command element to serve as higher headquarters for large-scale training and field exercises, evaluating and coordinating the units as they trained. It would also conduct quarterly status checks with the three brigades to discuss readiness and resource issues affecting those units, ensuring that they were at peak performance should they be needed.

To expand upon the concept of Reserve component and National Guard components, the First Army activated Division East and Division West, two commands responsible for training reserve units&#x27; readiness and mobilization exercises. Division West, activated at Fort Carson. This transformation was part of an overall restructuring of the US Army to streamline the organizations overseeing training. The Division West took control of reserve units in 21 states west of the Mississippi River, eliminating the need for the 7th Infantry Division headquarters. As such it was subsequently inactivated for the last time on 22 August 2006 at Fort Carson.

Though it was inactivated, the division was identified as the highest priority inactive division in the United States Army Center of Military History&#x27;s scheme based on age, campaign participation credit, and unit decorations. All of the division&#x27;s flags and heraldic items were moved to the National Infantry Museum at Fort Moore, Georgia following its inactivation. At the time it was determined that, should the US Army decide to activate more divisions in the future, the center would most likely suggest the first new division be the 7th Infantry Division, the second be the 9th Infantry Division, the third be the 24th Infantry Division, the fourth be the 5th Infantry Division, and the fifth be the 2nd Armored Division.

===Headquarters reactivation===
On 26 April 2012, Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh announced the 7th Infantry Division headquarters would be reactivated at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in October 2012. The headquarters element of about 250 would not activate any subordinate brigades. Instead, it filled an administrative role as a non-deployable unit. In the announcement, McHugh noted the base is home to I Corps, which until then had directly overseen 10 subordinate brigades on the base, while other bases with similar corps headquarters had active division commands for intermediate oversight. The unit oversees the 2nd and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams of the 2nd Infantry Division, as well as the 17th Field Artillery Brigade, 201st Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, and 555th Engineer Brigade, about 21,000 personnel. The mission of the headquarters primarily focuses on making sure soldiers are properly trained and equipped, and that order and discipline is maintained in its subordinate brigades.

In the announcement, McHugh denied that the move was made in response to several high-profile misconduct allegations leveled against soldiers from the base in the Afghanistan War such as the Maywand District murders and the Kandahar massacre. Major General Stephen R. Lanza, the Army&#x27;s chief of public affairs, was tapped to lead the division. It activated on the base on 10 October 2012.

On 16 August 2024, the 1st and 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Teams were part of a re-patching ceremony officially realigning these two brigades from the 2nd Infantry Division to the 7th Infantry Division. According to the 7th Infantry Division official Facebook post about this event, &quot;This historic event honors their extensive legacy, creates a stronger and more unified force and brings Bayonet Soldiers closer together.&quot;

<text>Andrea Tafi (1213–1294) was an Italian artist. He is probably best known for his work on the mosaics of the Baptistery in Florence, which were started in 1225 by Jacobus. His pupils included Buonamico Buffalmacco.

Tafi is shown in Frederic Leighton&#x27;s &quot;Cimabue&#x27;s Celebrated Madonna&quot; (1853–1855); the subject matter of this painting is based on Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s account of how the &quot;Rucellai Madonna&quot; was carried from Cimabue&#x27;s home to the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.

Vasari includes a biography of Andrea Tafi in his &quot;Lives&quot;; the biography includes a tale of how Buonamico di Cristofano stopped Tafi from rising so early by pretending to be a demon.

<text>John Jacob Astor III (June 10, 1822 – February 22, 1890) was an American financier, philanthropist and a soldier during the American Civil War. He was a prominent member of the Astor family, becoming the wealthiest member in his generation.

==Early life and education==
Astor was the eldest son of real estate businessman William Backhouse Astor Sr. and Margaret Alida Rebecca Armstrong. One of his younger brothers was businessman William Backhouse Astor Jr.

His paternal grandparents were merchant-trader John Jacob Astor, who made his first fortune in the North American fur trade, and Sarah Cox Todd. Astor&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Senator John Armstrong Jr. and Alida Livingston of the Livingston family.

John Astor III studied at Columbia College, graduating in 1839, and the University of Göttingen, following which he went to Harvard Law School, graduating in 1842. He practiced law for a year, to qualify for assisting in the management of his family&#x27;s immense estate, one half of which later descended to him.

==Career==
In business, Astor dabbled in railroad investment, but was outsmarted by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and forced to yield control of the original New York Central Railroad line (from Albany to Buffalo) to him. His principal business interest was the vast Astor Estate real estate holdings in New York City, which he managed profitably and parsimoniously.

===Military service===
Astor was elected lieutenant colonel of the 12th Regiment of the New York Militia. He resigned from the office in 1853.

During the American Civil War, Astor served as a volunteer aide-de-camp, with the rank of colonel, to Major General George B. McClellan (then commanding general of the U.S. Army) from November 30, 1861, to July 11, 1862. In recognition of his services during the Peninsular Campaign, Astor was brevetted as a brigadier general of Volunteers in March 1865.

In 1880 he became a companion of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States—a military society of officers who had served in the Union armed forces. He was assigned insignia number 1909.

He regarded his Civil War service as the best of his life and attended the reunions of the Loyal Legion with zeal.

===Philanthropy===
Astor donated objects and funds to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (in 1887 he presented it with his wife&#x27;s collection of valuable laces and left a bequest of $50,000). He and his brother presented Trinity Church with a memorial to their father: a sculptured reredos and altar costing $80,000. He left a bequest of $450,000 to the Astor Library, bringing the family benefactions to the institution to a total of about $1,500,000. He also gave generously to the New York Cancer Hospital ($100,000 bequest), the Woman&#x27;s Hospital, St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital ($100,000 bequest) and the Children&#x27;s Aid Society.

He took an active interest in the Astor Library beyond funding. He was treasurer of its board of trustees, and in 1879 deeded to it the three lots on which the northern wing of the present building was later constructed by him. He presented it with his collection of early books and rare manuscripts.

His deeply religious wife Charlotte supported the newly formed Children&#x27;s Aid Society and sat on the board of the Women&#x27;s Hospital of New York, an institution that to her dismay refused to accept cancer patients. She persuaded her husband to donate the money ($225,000) to erect the New York Cancer Hospital&#x27;s first wing, the &quot;Astor Pavilion&quot;. For twenty years, she supported a German industrial school. From 1872 until her death, she was a manager of the Woman&#x27;s Hospital, besides taking an active part in the Niobrara League to aid the Indians and in many other charities. She bequeathed $150,000 to charitable organizations.

==Personal life==

On December 9, 1846, Astor was married at Trinity Church in New York City to Charlotte Augusta Gibbes (February 27, 1825 – December 12, 1887). Her parents were Thomas Stanyarne Gibbes Jr. and Susan Annette Vanden Heuvel. She was a descendant of Charles Apthorp, Jan Cornelius Van den Heuvel, and South Carolina Governor Robert Gibbes. Together, they had one child, William Waldorf Astor in 1848, who later became the 1st Viscount Astor and married Mary Dahlgren Paul.

In 1859, he built a home at 338 Fifth Avenue, today the street address of the Empire State Building. Later, he had an imposing vacation home, &quot;Beaulieu&quot;, built in Newport, Rhode Island, and he had a country estate, Nuits, at Ardsley-on-Hudson in Irvington, New York. Astor increasingly visited London in his later years. His son moved there permanently with his family in 1891 and became a British citizen in 1899, later being made Lord Astor.

John Jacob Astor III died on February 22, 1890, and was interred in the Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan.

<text>In mathematical analysis, a function of bounded variation, also known as &#x27; function, is a real-valued function whose total variation is bounded (finite): the graph of a function having this property is well behaved in a precise sense. For a continuous function of a single variable, being of bounded variation means that the distance along the direction of the -axis, neglecting the contribution of motion along -axis, traveled by a point moving along the graph has a finite value. For a continuous function of several variables, the meaning of the definition is the same, except for the fact that the continuous path to be considered cannot be the whole graph of the given function (which is a hypersurface in this case), but can be every intersection of the graph itself with a hyperplane (in the case of functions of two variables, a plane) parallel to a fixed -axis and to the -axis.

Functions of bounded variation are precisely those with respect to which one may find Riemann–Stieltjes integrals of all continuous functions.

Another characterization states that the functions of bounded variation on a compact interval are exactly those which can be written as a difference , where both and are bounded monotone. In particular, a BV function may have discontinuities, but at most countably many.

In the case of several variables, a function defined on an open subset of formula_1 is said to have bounded variation if its distributional derivative is a vector-valued finite Radon measure.

One of the most important aspects of functions of bounded variation is that they form an algebra of discontinuous functions whose first derivative exists almost everywhere: due to this fact, they can and frequently are used to define generalized solutions of nonlinear problems involving functionals, ordinary and partial differential equations in mathematics, physics and engineering.

We have the following chains of inclusions for continuous functions over a closed, bounded interval of the real line:

: [[Continuously differentiable]] ⊆ [[Lipschitz continuous]] ⊆ [[absolutely continuous]] ⊆ continuous and bounded variation ⊆ [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]]

==History==
According to Boris Golubov, BV functions of a single variable were first introduced by Camille Jordan, in the paper dealing with the convergence of Fourier series. The first successful step in the generalization of this concept to functions of several variables was due to Leonida Tonelli, who introduced a class of &quot;continuous&quot; BV functions in 1926 , to extend his direct method for finding solutions to problems in the calculus of variations in more than one variable. Ten years after, in , Lamberto Cesari &quot;changed the continuity requirement&quot; in Tonelli&#x27;s definition &quot;to a less restrictive integrability requirement&quot;, obtaining for the first time the class of functions of bounded variation of several variables in its full generality: as Jordan did before him, he applied the concept to resolve of a problem concerning the convergence of Fourier series, but for functions of &quot;two variables&quot;. After him, several authors applied BV functions to study Fourier series in several variables, geometric measure theory, calculus of variations, and mathematical physics. Renato Caccioppoli and Ennio De Giorgi used them to define measure of nonsmooth boundaries of sets (see the entry &quot;Caccioppoli set&quot; for further information). Olga Arsenievna Oleinik introduced her view of generalized solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations as functions from the space BV in the paper , and was able to construct a generalized solution of bounded variation of a first order partial differential equation in the paper : few years later, Edward D. Conway and Joel A. Smoller applied BV-functions to the study of a single nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation of first order in the paper , proving that the solution of the Cauchy problem for such equations is a function of bounded variation, provided the initial value belongs to the same class. Aizik Isaakovich Vol&#x27;pert developed extensively a calculus for BV functions: in the paper he proved the chain rule for BV functions and in the book he, jointly with his pupil Sergei Ivanovich Hudjaev, explored extensively the properties of BV functions and their application. His chain rule formula was later extended by Luigi Ambrosio and Gianni Dal Maso in the paper .

==Formal definition==

=== BV functions of one variable ===
 The total variation of a real-valued (or more generally complex-valued) function &quot;f&quot;, defined on an interval formula_2 is the quantity

:formula_3

where the supremum is taken over the set formula_4 of all partitions of the interval considered.

If &quot;f&quot; is differentiable and its derivative is Riemann-integrable, its total variation is the vertical component of the arc-length of its graph, that is to say,

:formula_5

 A real-valued function formula_6 on the real line is said to be of bounded variation (BV function) on a chosen interval formula_2 if its total variation is finite, &quot;i.e.&quot;
:formula_8

It can be proved that a real function formula_9 is of bounded variation in formula_10 if and only if it can be written as the difference formula_11 of two non-decreasing functions formula_12 and formula_13 on formula_10: this result is known as the Jordan decomposition of a function and it is related to the Jordan decomposition of a measure.

Through the Stieltjes integral, any function of bounded variation on a closed interval formula_15 defines a bounded linear functional on formula_16. In this special case, the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem states that every bounded linear functional arises uniquely in this way. The normalized positive functionals or probability measures correspond to positive non-decreasing lower semicontinuous functions. This point of view has been important in
spectral theory, in particular in its application to ordinary differential equations.

===BV functions of several variables===
Functions of bounded variation, BV functions, are functions whose distributional derivative is a Radon measure. More precisely:

 Let formula_17 be an open subset of formula_1. A function formula_19 belonging to formula_20 is said of bounded variation (BV function), and written

:formula_21

if there exists a finite vector Radon measure formula_22 such that the following equality holds

:formula_23

that is, formula_24 defines a linear functional on the space formula_25 of continuously differentiable vector functions formula_26 of compact support contained in formula_17: the vector measure formula_28 represents therefore the distributional or weak gradient of formula_24.

BV can be defined equivalently in the following way.

 Given a function formula_24 belonging to formula_20, the total variation of formula_24 in formula_33 is defined as

:formula_34

where formula_35 is the essential supremum norm. Sometimes, especially in the theory of Caccioppoli sets, the following notation is used

:formula_36

in order to emphasize that formula_37 is the total variation of the distributional / weak gradient of formula_24. This notation reminds also that if formula_24 is of class formula_40 (i.e. a continuous and differentiable function having continuous derivatives) then its variation is exactly the integral of the absolute value of its gradient.

The space of functions of bounded variation (BV functions) can then be defined as

:formula_41

The two definitions are equivalent since if formula_42 then

:formula_43

therefore formula_44 defines a continuous linear functional on the space formula_45. Since formula_46 as a linear subspace, this continuous linear functional can be extended continuously and linearly to the whole formula_47 by the Hahn–Banach theorem. Hence the continuous linear functional defines a Radon measure by the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem.

===Locally BV functions===
If the function space of locally integrable functions, i.e. functions belonging to formula_48, is considered in the preceding definitions , and instead of the one of globally integrable functions, then the function space defined is that of functions of locally bounded variation. Precisely, developing this idea for , a local variation is defined as follows,

: formula_49

for every set formula_50, having defined formula_51 as the set of all precompact open subsets of formula_33 with respect to the standard topology of finite-dimensional vector spaces, and correspondingly the class of functions of locally bounded variation is defined as
:formula_53

===Notation===
There are basically two distinct conventions for the notation of spaces of functions of locally or globally bounded variation, and unfortunately they are quite similar: the first one, which is the one adopted in this entry, is used for example in references (partially), (partially), and is the following one
*formula_54 identifies the space of functions of globally bounded variation
*formula_55 identifies the space of functions of locally bounded variation
The second one, which is adopted in references and (partially), is the following:
*formula_56 identifies the space of functions of globally bounded variation
*formula_54 identifies the space of functions of locally bounded variation

==Basic properties==
Only the properties common to functions of one variable and to functions of several variables will be considered in the following, and proofs will be carried on only for functions of several variables since the proof for the case of one variable is a straightforward adaptation of the several variables case: also, in each section it will be stated if the property is shared also by functions of locally bounded variation or not. References , and are extensively used.

===BV functions have only jump-type or removable discontinuities===
In the case of one variable, the assertion is clear: for each point formula_58 in the interval formula_59 of definition of the function formula_24, either one of the following two assertions is true

:formula_61
:formula_62

while both limits exist and are finite. In the case of functions of several variables, there are some premises to understand: first of all, there is a continuum of directions along which it is possible to approach a given point formula_58 belonging to the domain formula_33⊂formula_1. It is necessary to make precise a suitable concept of limit: choosing a unit vector formula_66 it is possible to divide formula_33 in two sets

:formula_68

Then for each point formula_58 belonging to the domain formula_70 of the BV function formula_24, only one of the following two assertions is true

:formula_72
:formula_73

or formula_58 belongs to a subset of formula_33 having zero formula_76-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The quantities

:formula_77

are called approximate limits of the BV function formula_24 at the point formula_58.

===&quot;V&quot;(⋅, Ω) is lower semi-continuous on &quot;L&quot;1(Ω)===
The functional formula_80 is lower semi-continuous:
to see this, choose a Cauchy sequence of BV-functions formula_81 converging to formula_82. Then, since all the functions of the sequence and their limit function are integrable and by the definition of lower limit

:formula_83

Now considering the supremum on the set of functions formula_84 such that formula_85 then the following inequality holds true

:formula_86

which is exactly the definition of lower semicontinuity.

===BV(Ω) is a Banach space===
By definition formula_87 is a subset of formula_20, while linearity follows from the linearity properties of the defining integral i.e.

:formula_89

for all formula_90 therefore formula_91for all formula_92, and

:formula_93

for all formula_94, therefore formula_95 for all formula_96, and all formula_94. The proved vector space properties imply that formula_87 is a vector subspace of formula_20. Consider now the function formula_100 defined as

:formula_101

where formula_102 is the usual formula_20 norm: it is easy to prove that this is a norm on formula_87. To see that formula_87 is complete respect to it, i.e. it is a Banach space, consider a Cauchy sequence formula_81 in formula_87. By definition it is also a Cauchy sequence in formula_20 and therefore has a limit formula_24 in formula_20: since formula_111 is bounded in formula_87 for each formula_113, then formula_114 by lower semicontinuity of the variation formula_115, therefore formula_24 is a BV function. Finally, again by lower semicontinuity, choosing an arbitrary small positive number formula_117

:formula_118
From this we deduce that formula_115 is continuous because it&#x27;s a norm.

===BV(Ω) is not separable===
To see this, it is sufficient to consider the following example belonging to the space formula_120: for each 0 &lt; &quot;α&quot; &lt; 1 define
:formula_121
as the characteristic function of the left-closed interval formula_122. Then, choosing formula_123 such that formula_124 the following relation holds true:
:formula_125
Now, in order to prove that every dense subset of formula_126 cannot be countable, it is sufficient to see that for every formula_127 it is possible to construct the balls
:formula_128
Obviously those balls are pairwise disjoint, and also are an indexed family of sets whose index set is formula_129. This implies that this family has the cardinality of the continuum: now, since every dense subset of formula_120 must have at least a point inside each member of this family, its cardinality is at least that of the continuum and therefore cannot a be countable subset. This example can be obviously extended to higher dimensions, and since it involves only local properties, it implies that the same property is true also for formula_131.

===Chain rule for locally BV(Ω) functions===
Chain rules for nonsmooth functions are very important in mathematics and mathematical physics since there are several important physical models whose behaviors are described by functions or functionals with a very limited degree of smoothness. The following chain rule is proved in the paper . Note all partial derivatives must be interpreted in a generalized sense, i.e., as generalized derivatives.

Theorem. Let formula_132 be a function of class formula_40 (i.e. a continuous and differentiable function having continuous derivatives) and let formula_134 be a function in formula_135 with formula_17 being an open subset of formula_137.
Then formula_138 and

:formula_139

where formula_140 is the mean value of the function at the point formula_141, defined as

:formula_142

A more general chain rule formula for Lipschitz continuous functions formula_143 has been found by Luigi Ambrosio and Gianni Dal Maso and is published in the paper . However, even this formula has very important direct consequences: we use formula_144 in place of formula_145, where formula_146 is also a formula_147 function. We have to assume also that formula_148 is locally integrable with respect to the measure formula_149 for each formula_150, and that formula_151 is locally integrable with respect to the measure formula_152 for each formula_150. Then choosing formula_154, the preceding formula gives the Leibniz rule for &#x27;BV&#x27; functions

:formula_155

==Generalizations and extensions==

=== Weighted BV functions ===
It is possible to generalize the above notion of total variation so that different variations are weighted differently. More precisely, let formula_156 be any increasing function such that formula_157 (the weight function) and let formula_158 be a function from the interval formula_159formula_160 taking values in a normed vector space formula_161. Then the formula_162-variation of formula_9 over formula_164 is defined as

:formula_165

where, as usual, the supremum is taken over all finite partitions of the interval formula_164, i.e. all the finite sets of real numbers formula_167 such that

:formula_168

The original notion of variation considered above is the special case of formula_169-variation for which the weight function is the identity function: therefore an integrable function formula_9 is said to be a weighted BV function (of weight formula_169) if and only if its formula_169-variation is finite.

:formula_173

The space formula_174 is a topological vector space with respect to the norm

:formula_175

where formula_176 denotes the usual supremum norm of &quot;formula_9&quot;. Weighted BV functions were introduced and studied in full generality by Władysław Orlicz and Julian Musielak in the paper : Laurence Chisholm Young studied earlier the case formula_178 where &quot;formula_179&quot; is a positive integer.

===SBV functions===
SBV functions &quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;Special functions of Bounded Variation&quot; were introduced by Luigi Ambrosio and Ennio De Giorgi in the paper , dealing with free discontinuity variational problems: given an open subset formula_17 of formula_1, the space formula_182 is a proper linear subspace of formula_87, since the weak gradient of each function belonging to it consists precisely of the sum of an formula_113-dimensional support and an formula_76-dimensional support measure and &quot;no intermediate-dimensional terms&quot;, as seen in the following definition.

Definition. Given a locally integrable function formula_24, then formula_187 if and only if

1. There exist two Borel functions formula_9 and formula_189 of domain formula_33 and codomain formula_1 such that

:formula_192

2. For all of continuously differentiable vector functions formula_193 of compact support contained in formula_17, &quot;i.e.&quot; for all formula_195 the following formula is true:

:formula_196

where formula_197 is the formula_198-dimensional Hausdorff measure.

Details on the properties of &quot;SBV&quot; functions can be found in works cited in the bibliography section: particularly the paper contains a useful bibliography.

===BV sequences===
As particular examples of Banach spaces, consider spaces of sequences of bounded variation, in addition to the spaces of functions of bounded variation. The total variation of a sequence &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;) of real or complex numbers is defined by
:formula_199

The space of all sequences of finite total variation is denoted by BV. The norm on BV is given by
:formula_200
With this norm, the space BV is a Banach space which is isomorphic to formula_201.

The total variation itself defines a norm on a certain subspace of BV, denoted by BV0, consisting of sequences &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;i) for which
:formula_202
The norm on BV0 is denoted
:formula_203
With respect to this norm BV0 becomes a Banach space as well, which is isomorphic &quot;and&quot; isometric to formula_201 (although not in the natural way).

===Measures of bounded variation===
A signed (or complex) measure &quot;formula_205&quot; on a measurable space formula_206 is said to be of bounded variation if its total variation&quot; formula_207&quot; is bounded: see , or the entry &quot;Total variation&quot; for further details.

==Examples==

As mentioned in the introduction, two large class of examples of BV functions are monotone functions, and absolutely continuous functions. For a negative example: the function

:formula_208

is &quot;not&quot; of bounded variation on the interval formula_209
While it is harder to see, the continuous function

:formula_210

is &quot;not&quot; of bounded variation on the interval formula_209 either.
At the same time, the function

:formula_212

is of bounded variation on the interval formula_213. However, &quot;all three functions are of bounded variation on each interval&quot; formula_10 &quot;with&quot; formula_215.

Every monotone, bounded function is of bounded variation. For such a function formula_9 on the interval formula_10 and any partition formula_218 of this interval, it can be seen that

:formula_219

from the fact that the sum on the left is telescoping. From this, it follows that for such formula_9,

:formula_221

In particular, the monotone Cantor function is a well-known example of a function of bounded variation that is not absolutely continuous.

The Sobolev space formula_222 is a proper subset of formula_54. In fact, for each formula_19 in formula_225 it is possible to choose a measure formula_226 (where formula_227 is the Lebesgue measure on formula_33) such that the equality

:formula_229

holds, since it is nothing more than the definition of weak derivative, and hence holds true. One can easily find an example of a BV function which is not formula_230: in dimension one, any step function with a non-trivial jump will do.

==Applications==

=== Mathematics ===

Functions of bounded variation have been studied in connection with the set of discontinuities of functions and differentiability of real functions, and the following results are well-known. If formula_9 is a real function of bounded variation on an interval formula_10 then

* formula_9 is continuous except at most on a countable set;
* formula_9 has one-sided limits everywhere (limits from the left everywhere in formula_235, and from the right everywhere in formula_236 ;
* the derivative formula_237 exists almost everywhere (i.e. except for a set of measure zero).

For real functions of several real variables

* the characteristic function of a Caccioppoli set is a BV function: BV functions lie at the basis of the modern theory of perimeters.
* Minimal surfaces are graphs of BV functions: in this context, see reference .

===Physics and engineering===
The ability of BV functions to deal with discontinuities has made their use widespread in the applied sciences: solutions of problems in mechanics, physics, chemical kinetics are very often representable by functions of bounded variation. The book details a very ample set of mathematical physics applications of BV functions. Also there is some modern application which deserves a brief description.

*The Mumford–Shah functional: the segmentation problem for a two-dimensional image, i.e. the problem of faithful reproduction of contours and grey scales is equivalent to the minimization of such functional.

<doc id="330675" wikidata="Q4515839" url="?curid=330675" title="Chicago Tylenol murders">
<text>}}

The Chicago Tylenol murders were a series of poisoning deaths resulting from drug tampering in the Chicago metropolitan area in 1982. The victims consumed Tylenol-branded acetaminophen capsules that had been laced with potassium cyanide. Seven people died in the original poisonings, and there were several more deaths in subsequent copycat crimes.

No suspect has been charged or convicted of the poisonings as of 2025, but New York City resident James William Lewis was convicted of extortion for sending a letter to Tylenol&#x27;s manufacturer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, that took responsibility for the deaths and demanded $1 million to stop them.
The incidents led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter drugs and to federal anti-tampering laws.

==Deaths and early public-safety efforts==
On September 28, 1982, 12-year-old Mary Kellerman was hospitalized after consuming a capsule of Extra Strength Tylenol; she died the next day. On September 29, six other individuals consumed contaminated Tylenol, including Adam Janus (27), Stanley Janus (25), and Theresa Janus (20), who each took Tylenol from a single bottle. All six—the Januses, Mary McFarland (31), Paula Prince (35), and Mary Reiner (27)—would ultimately die from consuming the pills.

Asked to investigate the Januses&#x27; deaths, nurse Helen Jensen, Arlington Heights&#x27;s only public health official, visited the Janus household and discovered a Tylenol bottle with an accompanying receipt indicating it had been purchased the same day. Noticing that there were six pills missing, she turned the bottle over to investigator Nick Pishos and reported her suspicion that it was related to the Januses&#x27; deaths. Pishos called Dr. Edmund R. Donoghue, deputy chief medical examiner for Cook County, who, suspecting that cyanide may be the culprit, asked Pishos to smell the bottle. When Pishos smelled an almond-like scent, Donoghue asked the county&#x27;s chief toxicologist, Dr. Michael Schaffer, to test the capsules, and Schaffer&#x27;s team determined that four of the 44 remaining capsules from the Janus&#x27; bottle contained nearly three times the fatal amount of cyanide. Authorities held a press conference advising the public not to take Tylenol for the time being. 

By chance, the bottle of Tylenol that Kellerman used was inventoried by paramedics. Investigators noticed that the Janus bottle and the Kellerman bottle came from the same lot, MC2880, and Johnson &amp; Johnson issued a recall for all Tylenol from that lot. But when tainted bottles from other lots were discovered (for example, the pills in Mary McFarland&#x27;s possession were traced to lots 1910 MD and MB 2738), the recall expanded to cover those lots and any bottle of extra-strength capsules (from any lot) purchased in the Chicago area, making it one of the largest pharmaceutical recalls ever.

A multi-agency investigation found the tampered pills to have been sold or on the shelves at a variety of stores in the Chicago area, including two different Jewel Foods locations (one in Arlington Heights, one in Elk Grove Village); an Osco Drug store (in Schaumburg); a Walgreens and a Dominick&#x27;s (both in Chicago); and a Frank&#x27;s Finer Foods (in Winfield). One bottle had been purchased but, due to an off scent, not yet used by Linda Morgan, wife of Judge Lewis V. Morgan.

In an effort to reassure the public, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the manufacturer of Tylenol, distributed warnings to hospitals and distributors and halted Tylenol production and advertising. After other incidents, like strychnine added to Tylenol bottles in California, a nationwide recall of Tylenol products was issued on October 5, 1982; an estimated 31 million bottles were in circulation, with a retail value of over US$100 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The company also advertised in the national media for individuals not to consume any of its products that contained acetaminophen after it was determined that only these capsules had been tampered with. Johnson &amp; Johnson also offered to exchange all Tylenol capsules already purchased by the public for solid tablets.

Customs at airports outside the U.S. were asking visitors if they brought Tylenol medicine with them.

==Police investigation==
The tainted capsules were found to have been manufactured at two different locationsPennsylvania and Texassuggesting that the capsules were tampered with after the product had been placed on store shelves for sale. The police hypothesis was that someone had taken bottles off shelves in local stores of the Chicago area, placed potassium cyanide in some of the capsules, and then placed the packages back on the store shelves to be purchased by unknowing customers. In addition to the five bottles that led to the victims&#x27; deaths, a few other contaminated bottles were later discovered in the Chicago area.

In early 1983, at the FBI&#x27;s request, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Bob Greene published the address and grave location of the first and youngest victim, Mary Kellerman. The story, written with the Kellerman family&#x27;s consent, was proposed by FBI criminal analyst John Douglas on the theory that the perpetrator might visit the house or gravesite if they were made aware of their locations. Both sites were kept under 24-hour video surveillance for several months, but the killer did not surface.

A surveillance photo of Paula Prince purchasing cyanide-tampered Tylenol at a Walgreens at 1601 North Wells Street in Chicago was released by the Chicago Police Department. Police believe that a bearded man seen just feet behind Prince may be the killer.

===Suspects===
During the initial investigations, a man named James William Lewis was accused of sending a letter to Johnson &amp; Johnson demanding $1 million to stop the cyanide-induced murders. Upon his arrest, Lewis told authorities how the person behind the attacks may have carried out the killings—by buying Tylenol, adding cyanide to the bottles, and returning them to the store shelves. Lewis was also found to have previously possessed a poisoning book, and, according to a confidential law-enforcement document, his fingerprints were discovered on pages related to cyanide. Lewis denied being responsible for the poisonings, but he admitted to writing the letter, which he said he had worked on for three days. During the trial, his attorneys claimed that Lewis &quot;intended only to focus the attention of the authorities on his wife&#x27;s former employer.&quot; Lewis was convicted of extortion and sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
In 2007, authorities determined that the letter had an October 1, 1982, postmark, meaning that, if Lewis&#x27;s three-day timeline was accurate, he would have begun working on the letter prior to the first news reports concerning the poisonings. When confronted with this information, Lewis recanted his timeline. Court documents released in early 2009 &quot;show Department of Justice investigators concluded Lewis was responsible for the poisonings, despite the fact that they did not have enough evidence to charge him&quot;. In January 2010, both Lewis and his wife submitted DNA samples and fingerprints to authorities. Lewis said &quot;if the FBI plays it fair, I have nothing to worry about&quot;. The DNA samples did not match any DNA recovered on the bottles. Lewis continued to deny responsibility for the poisonings. Lewis died on July 9, 2023, at age 76.

Police also investigated a second man, Roger Arnold, a dock worker at a Jewel-Osco in Melrose Park, who told officers that he possessed potassium cyanide. Bar owner Marty Sinclair, whose establishment Arnold frequented, reported Arnold to the police, saying that Arnold had discussed killing people with a white powder and had become increasingly erratic after his marriage had dissolved. Arnold had worked with victim Mary Reiner&#x27;s father at a warehouse, and Arnold&#x27;s wife had been treated at a hospital across the street from the store in which Reiner bought her cyanide-laced pills. A copy of &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s James Bond&quot;, which contained instructions on making potassium cyanide, was found in Arnold&#x27;s home. Arnold was held several times by the police, but never charged. In the summer of 1983, Arnold, mistaking John Stanisha (a random passerby) for Sinclair, shot and killed Stanisha, a computer consultant and father of three, who was leaving a bar with multiple friends. Arnold was convicted of the killing in January 1984 and served 15 years of his 30-year sentence for second-degree murder, saying in 1996 from prison: &quot;I killed a man, a perfectly innocent person. I had choices. I could have walked away.&quot; He died in June 2008. In 2010, Arnold&#x27;s body was exhumed (and subsequently reburied) so that his femur bone could be removed for DNA testing. Arnold&#x27;s DNA did not match the DNA samples discovered on the bottles.

===21st-century investigation efforts===
In early January 2009, Illinois authorities renewed the investigation. Federal agents searched the home of Lewis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and seized a number of items. In Chicago, an FBI spokesman declined to comment but said &quot;we&#x27;ll have something to release later possibly&quot;.

In 2010, DNA samples were collected from Lewis and Arnold, whose body was exhumed for that purpose; neither&#x27;s DNA matched DNA samples found on the tainted bottles.

Law-enforcement officials received a number of tips related to the case coinciding with its 25th anniversary. In a written statement, the FBI explained,
This review was prompted, in part, by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity. Further, given the many recent advances in forensic technology, it was only natural that a second look be taken at the case and recovered evidence.
On May 19, 2011, the FBI requested DNA samples from &quot;Unabomber&quot; Ted Kaczynski in connection to the Tylenol murders. Kaczynski denied having ever possessed potassium cyanide. The first four Unabomber crimes happened in Chicago and its suburbs from 1978 to 1980, and Kaczynski&#x27;s parents had a suburban Chicago home in Lombard, Illinois, in 1982, where he stayed occasionally.

==Aftermath==
===Copycats===
Hundreds of copycat attacks involving Tylenol, other over-the-counter medications, and other products also took place around the United States immediately following the Chicago deaths.

Three more deaths occurred in 1986 from gelatin capsules.

23-year-old Diane Elsroth died in Yonkers, New York, after ingesting &quot;Extra-Strength Tylenol&quot; capsules laced with cyanide.

Excedrin capsules in Washington state were tampered with, resulting in the deaths of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell from cyanide poisoning and the eventual arrest and conviction of Bruce Nickell&#x27;s wife, Stella Nickell, for her intentional actions in the crimes connected to both murders.

That same year, Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Encaprin was recalled after a spiking hoax in Chicago and Detroit that resulted in a precipitous sales drop and a withdrawal of the pain reliever from the market.

In 1991 in Washington state, Kathleen Daneker and Stanley McWhorter were killed from two cyanide-tainted boxes of Sudafed, and Jennifer Meling went into a coma from a similar poisoning but recovered shortly thereafter. Jennifer&#x27;s husband, Joseph Meling, was convicted on numerous charges in a federal Seattle court regarding the deaths of Daneker and McWhorter and the attempted murder of his wife, who was abused during the Melings&#x27; marriage. Meling was sentenced to life imprisonment and lost an appeal for a retrial.

In 1986, University of Texas student Kenneth Faries was found dead in his apartment after succumbing to cyanide poisoning. Tampered Anacin capsules were determined to be the source of the cyanide found in his body. His death was ruled as a homicide on May 30, 1986. On June 19, 1986, the AP reported that the Travis County Medical Examiner ruled his death a likely suicide. The FDA determined he obtained the poison from a lab in which he worked.

===Johnson &amp; Johnson response===
Johnson &amp; Johnson received positive coverage for its handling of the crisis; case in point, an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;Johnson &amp; Johnson has effectively demonstrated how a major business ought to handle a disaster&quot;. The article further stated that &quot;this is no Three Mile Island accident in which the company&#x27;s response did more damage than the original incident&quot;, and applauded the company for being honest with the public. In addition to issuing the recall, the company established relations with the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, and the Food and Drug Administration. This way it could have a part in searching for the person who laced the capsules and they could help prevent further tampering. While at the time of the scare the company&#x27;s market share collapsed from 35 percent to 8 percent, it rebounded in less than a year, a move credited to the company&#x27;s prompt and aggressive reaction. In November, it reintroduced capsules in a new, triple-sealed package, coupled with heavy price promotions. Within several years, Tylenol regained the highest market share for the over-the-counter analgesic in the US.

After the recall, Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary McNeil Laboratories submitted a claim to its insurance company, Affiliated FM Insurance, for the cost of carrying out the recall, a claim which was later denied. A lawsuit determined that McNeil Laboratories was ultimately not covered because the parent company Johnson &amp; Johnson elected not to buy more expensive recall insurance. McNeil sued again in court, further contending that the language of its excess liability insurance policy covered the recall and recall-related expenses. The court hearing that case rejected a claim of liability, stating that the recall &quot;was not caused by liability for the seven deaths; it was at best merely related to the seven deaths in that they served as notice to the plaintiff that the Tylenol remaining on the shelves was potentially harmful.&quot;

In 1991, Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to settle, for an undisclosed sum, all lawsuits against it for the original Chicago area deaths. Robert Kniffin, a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, stated that &quot;though there is no way we could have anticipated a criminal tampering with our product or prevented it, we wanted to do something for the families and finally get this tragic event behind us.&quot;

The crisis management response, taught today as a model of corporate public relations, is chiefly credited to public relations executive Harold Burson.

===Pharmaceutical changes===
The 1982 incident inspired the pharmaceutical, food, and consumer product industries to develop tamper-resistant packaging, such as induction seals and improved quality control methods. Moreover, product tampering was made a federal crime. The new laws resulted in Stella Nickell&#x27;s conviction in the Excedrin tampering case, for which she was sentenced to 90 years in prison.

Additionally, the incident prompted the pharmaceutical industry to move away from capsules, which were easy to contaminate as a foreign substance could be placed inside without obvious signs of tampering. Within the year, the FDA introduced more stringent regulations to avoid product tampering. This led to the eventual replacement of the capsule with the solid &quot;caplet&quot;, a tablet made in the shape of a capsule, as a drug delivery form and with the addition of tamper-evident safety seals to bottles of many sorts.

===1982 Halloween===
While poisoned candy being given to trick-or-treaters at Halloween is rare, the Tylenol incident, which unfolded across October 1982, raised renewed fears of it. Some communities discouraged trick-or-treating for Halloween, and American grocery stores reported that candy sales were down more than 20%.

<doc id="330682" wikidata="Q4864469" url="?curid=330682" title="Barry Marder">
<text>Barry Marder is an American stand-up comedian, actor, author, and comedy writer. He is identified with the characters of Ted L. Nancy (author of the &quot;Letters from a Nut&quot; series of books) and Ed Broth (author of &quot;Stories From A Moron: Real Stories Rejected by Real Magazines&quot;). He has opened regularly for Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s stand-up act, and he co-wrote the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Bee Movie&quot;.

==Career==
Marder has performed as the opening act for Jerry Seinfeld throughout the US. He has written for Bill Maher, Jay Leno, David Letterman, and the talk show &quot;Night Stand with Dick Dietrick&quot;. He co-wrote &quot;Bee Movie&quot; for the DreamWorks, along with Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Feresten, and Andy Robin, that was released November 2, 2007. Marder appeared on Seinfeld&#x27;s internet series &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; on September 6, 2012 in the episode &quot;You Don&#x27;t Want to Offend a Cannibal&quot;, and on July 19, 2019, in the episode &quot;Big Lots and BevMo!&quot; In 1984, he appeared in a comedy film, &quot;Where the Boys Are &#x27;84&quot;, as the character Rappaport.

===Early projects===
In 2005, Seinfeld, Marder, and Kenneth Braun signed a deal for an animated comedy series pilot based on &quot;Stories From A Moron&quot;. 

===Other personas===
On the Ted L. Nancy official website, Marder confessed to being both &quot;Ted L. Nancy&quot; and &quot;Ed Broth.&quot; The books of both Broth and Ted L. Nancy include a foreword by Seinfeld, who claims in both books to have met with each author. In the foreword to &quot;Stories From A Moron&quot;, Seinfeld describes Broth as a &quot;friend,&quot; and states that his stories &quot;…don&#x27;t completely make sense, but they don&#x27;t make nonsense either…&quot; 

====Ted L. Nancy====
Under the pseudonym &quot;Ted L. Nancy,&quot; Marder wrote a series of books containing excerpts of his prank letters, together with their responses. Books in the series include: &quot;Letters from a Nut&quot;, &quot;More Letters from a Nut&quot;, &quot;Extra Nutty! Even More Letters from a Nut&quot;, &quot;Hello Junk Mail!&quot;, &quot;Ted L. Nancy’s Afternoon Stories&quot;, and &quot;All New Letters from a Nut&quot;. Comedian Bruce Baum is the co-author of the first three books. In 2013, Scholastic published an historical Ted L. Nancy book entitled &quot;Letters From A Nut&#x27;s Family Tree&quot;.

In 2002, ABC developed a pilot for a television series based on &quot;Letters From A Nut&quot;. It was written and produced by Marder and Seinfeld. In 2003 FX Television made a pilot for &quot;The Ted L. Nancy Show.&quot; That show was written and produced by Marder and Seinfeld. Again in 2007, Lionsgate Television optioned the books from Marder to make into a television show, as reported by &quot;Daily Variety&quot;. The following year, Lionsgate sold the show as a pilot presentation to Fox TV. That show, called &quot;Sincerely, Ted L. Nancy&quot;, is created and written by Seinfeld, Marder and Chuck Martin. In the pilot, Ted L. Nancy (Kevin Sussman) is the voice for the underdog consumer who is usually the last to get help from customer service.

In April 2016, the first two episodes of Ted L. Nancy&#x27;s &quot;SCAMMERS&quot; appeared on Hulu. The shorts were produced with Robert Redford&#x27;s Sundance Productions. In these, Ted L. Nancy answers unscrupulous people who promise him great wealth through emails.

====Ed Broth====
Under the pseudonym &quot;Ed Broth&quot; (at one time thought by some to be a real prank author who submits joke letters to organizations and then publishes their responses), Marder wrote &quot;Stories From A Moron: Real Stories Rejected by Real Magazines&quot;, published in January 2005 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press. The covers of the Ed Broth books show the title and author&#x27;s name written childishly. The book comprises numerous prank letters the Ed Broth persona mailed to magazines along with their responses. One example is his essay entitled &quot;I Love Dogs&quot;, that was sent to the publishers of &quot;I Love Cats&quot; magazine. The book&#x27;s dust jacket description of Ed Broth states that &quot;…[Broth] is a writer living in Toluca Lake, California. He likes pimentos in his potato salad&quot;. Jerry Seinfeld hosted a toast in his honor, although Ed Broth was not in attendance. Ed Broth&#x27;s most recent literary project is a book of cartoons called &quot;The Oddvious&quot;. Many believe the illustrator of &quot;The Oddvious&quot; is Alan Marder, who also illustrated &quot;Stories From A Moron: Real Stories Rejected by Real Magazines&quot;; &quot;Letters From a Nut&quot;; and &quot;Hello Junk Mail!&quot; by Ted L. Nancy.

==Other projects==
===&quot;Letters From A Nut: The Play&quot;===
In June 2017 the &quot;Letters From A Nut&quot; Play was presented at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles for a five-week run. Ted L. Nancy read his letters and Beth Kennedy read the replies bringing the books to life. Video and artwork by Alan Marder accompanied the presentation.

In 2019, Patrick Warburton toured the country with a different version of the Letters From A Nut Play. Warburton read the letters as the Ted L. Nancy character with rotating actors in the Service Rep role.

===&quot;Unfrosted&quot;===
Netflix won a bidding war for the film, &quot;Unfrosted&quot;, in June 2021. It stars, and is directed by, Jerry Seinfeld. It is written by Seinfeld, Feresten, and Marder. The film premiered at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theater in Hollywood on April 30, 2024. The film was released on Netflix on May 3, 2024.

<text>Saint-Denis (, ; ), unofficially Saint-Denis de La Réunion () for disambiguation, is the prefecture (administrative capital) of the French overseas department and region of Réunion, in the Indian Ocean. It is located at the island&#x27;s northernmost point, close to the mouth of the Rivière Saint-Denis.

Saint-Denis is the most populous commune in the French overseas departments and the nineteenth most populous in all of France. At the 2021 census, there were 319,141 inhabitants in the metropolitan area of Saint-Denis (as defined by INSEE), 154,765 of whom lived in the city (commune) of Saint-Denis proper and the remainder in the neighbouring communes of La Possession, Sainte-Marie, Sainte-Suzanne, Saint-André, and Bras-Panon.

==History==
===Foundation===
Saint-Denis was founded in 1669 by Étienne Regnault, the first governor of Bourbon Island (as La Réunion was then called), on the northern side of the island, where a larger and more fertile plain was deemed more propitious for the development of settlements than the drier and more barren area of Saint-Paul on the western side of the island. Saint-Paul had been the site of Bourbon Island&#x27;s first French settlement in 1663 due to the better anchorage and wind conditions of the western coast.

The new settlement was named Saint-Denis after the name of a ship owned by one of governor Regnault&#x27;s friends, which had landed in Réunion in 1668. Saint-Denis and Saint-Paul shared the role of colonial capital of Bourbon for some years, with the governor and colonial council staying alternatively in the two settlements, until Saint-Denis was chosen as the permanent location of Bourbon&#x27;s colonial government in 1738.

===18th century and Napoleonic Wars===
Soon after 1738, work was started to establish a seaport in the little bay of Le Barachois, on the eastern side of the Saint-Denis River, to replace the port of Saint-Paul, but its site did not offer a safe haven, due to unpredictable winds and tides, as well as frequent high surf which forced ships to unload their cargo in the open roadstead away from the shore, from where it was carried to the shore with the use of a mobile pier. Improvements in the 19th century resulted in the construction of a small artificial harbor where surf boats in charge of unloading cargo from larger ships could be protected from winds and swells, but it was regularly damaged by cyclones. Eventually it was replaced by a new and much larger artificial harbor built on the northwest coast of La Réunion in the 1880s, in today&#x27;s commune of Le Port, from Saint-Denis.

A royal decree in 1766 divided Bourbon Island in 5 &quot;quartiers&quot;, one of which was Saint-Denis. The checkerboard plan of the city, established by land surveyor Jean-Baptiste Bancks (sometimes spelled Banck, of Irish Jacobite descent), was officially adopted in 1777. In 1790, Saint-Denis became a commune. Its first mayor was Jean-Baptiste Delestrac.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Saint-Denis was captured by British troops on 8 July 1810. The British occupied Saint-Denis and the entire island during nearly 5 years. On 6 April 1815, after the Treaty of Paris, the British officially restored Bourbon Island to France during a ceremony held on the main square of Saint-Denis. Later in October 1815, as news of Napoleon&#x27;s return to France had arrived in the Indian Ocean, a British fleet from Mauritius presented itself in front of St Denis, asking the French governor of Bourbon Island to surrender the colony to His Britannic Majesty. The French governor refused and the British started a blockade of the island. Eventually on 28 October the news arrived of Napoleon&#x27;s 2nd abdication and Louis XVIII&#x27;s return to power, and the British fleet ended its blockade.

===Prosperity and urban development (1815–1860s)===
In the 18th century, cultivation of coffee had ensured the development of Saint-Denis. Warehouses in Saint-Denis stored the coffee beans before their export to Europe from the port of Saint-Denis. In the 19th century, following France&#x27;s loss of its largest sugar colonies of Saint-Domingue (Haiti) and the Isle of France (Mauritius) as a result of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, sugarcane replaced coffee as the main crop in Bourbon, and sugar became the main export, again ensuring the development of Saint-Denis, from where sugar was exported to Europe.

The prosperous period experienced by Saint-Denis after the Napoleonic Wars was marked by urban development and public investments. In 1818, due to the British annexation of the Isle of France (Mauritius) which was home to the only lycée in the Mascarene Islands, where Bourbon Island&#x27;s elites used to send their children for secondary education, Bourbon Island&#x27;s governor launched the construction of a royal college in Saint-Denis (), which opened in 1819, the first royal college on Bourbon Island (later renamed Lycée de La Réunion in 1848, then transformed into a collège, i.e. middle school, in 1968). In 1825 a law school (&quot;École de Jurisprudence&quot;) granting the Bachelor of Laws was established in Saint-Denis. 

Construction of the Saint-Denis Cathedral was begun in 1829 and completed in 1832. The theatre of Saint-Denis was built in 1835 with loggias and balconies (it was later destroyed by fire in 1919). That same year, construction of the &quot;Palais législatif&quot; (&quot;Legislative Palace&quot;) was begun and completed in 1837: the palace housed the Colonial Council (&quot;Conseil colonial&quot;), the legislative assembly of Bourbon Island; the palace was later turned over in 1855 to the newly created , the first natural history museum in the Indian Ocean. In 1843, following the example of Mauritius where horse races had become popular among French colonial planters, a racecourse was inaugurated at La Redoute, now transformed into a stadium. Construction of the Hôtel de Ville was started in 1846 and the building was inaugurated in 1860. The , a wrought iron structure, was built between 1864 and 1866.

The first cholera pandemic struck Saint-Denis in the beginning of 1820: cholera had arrived from Calcutta in Mauritius the year before, and despite strict orders from governor Milius forbidding any contact with Mauritius, one ship arriving from Mauritius evaded the orders and brought cholera to Saint-Denis. The authorities reacted quickly as soon as the disease was discovered in town by isolating sick people, establishing a military &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, and evacuating the rest of the population from the city. As a result, cholera was contained within the city limits and killed only 178 people (whereas it spread all over Mauritius and killed thousands of people there).

In 1841, the famous poet Charles Baudelaire, then 20 year-old, who had been sent on a voyage to Calcutta, India by his family in the hope of ending his dissolute habits, landed in Saint-Denis and stayed on Bourbon Island for 45 days, before deciding to return to metropolitan France without reaching India.

In 1847, the return to Bourbon Island of the Catholic Apostolic Vice-Prefect of the island, Alexandre Monnet, an abolitionist who had worked for the evangelization of Bourbon&#x27;s Black slaves and was returning from a trip to Europe where he had been celebrated in Paris and Rome for his work in favor of Black slaves, triggered two days of protests in Saint-Denis among the White colonists, who insulted the Apostolic Vice-Prefect without governor intervening to stop the turmoil. Due to strong opposition, and without any local support, Father Monnet, nicknamed the Father of Black People (&quot;le Père des Noirs&quot;), was forced to leave Bourbon Island only fifteen days later at the urging of the governor.

On June 9, 1848, after the arrival of news of the February 1848 French Revolution from Europe, governor Graëb announced the proclamation of the French Republic in Saint-Denis, and the island&#x27;s name was changed to La Réunion, the name it had already held between 1793 and 1806. The establishment of the Republic was met with coldness and distrust by the wealthy White planters due to the professed abolitionism of the new Republican authorities in Paris. On 18 October 1848 the new Commissioner of the Republic, Sarda Garriga, sent from Paris to replace governor Graëb, announced in Saint-Denis the abolition of slavery in Réunion Island, effective on 20 December 1848. In December the students at the lycée of Saint-Denis, sons of rich planters, demonstrated against the director of the lycée, a declared republican. Unable to calm the protestors, commissioner Sarda Garriga was forced to call in the troops and close the lycée for more than a month.

In 1853, the was founded in Saint-Denis with part of the compensation paid to Réunion&#x27;s slave owners by the French government after the 1848 abolition of slavery. It was the first commercial bank in Réunion, and also served as a central bank, with the legal right to issue banknotes. The next year a savings bank was also established in Saint-Denis.

=== Stagnation (1860s–1940s) ===
Saint-Denis was struck by the third cholera pandemic in 1859, the first time cholera was returning to Réunion since 1820. During the outbreaks of cholera in Mauritius in 1854 and 1856, strict sanitary measures forbidding the landing of ships in Réunion had prevented the disease from reaching the island. In 1859, however, a ship transporting indentured laborers from East Africa hid the cases of cholera on board from the Saint-Denis authorities and the ship was allowed to land. Cholera spread quickly and killed 863 people in the city (and 2,200 people in the entire island) in the space of two months and a half, one of the deadliest epidemics in the history of Réunion.

In the 1860s, cane cultivation was affected by the &quot;Chilo sacchariphagus&quot; pest, and the recruiting of labourers in India also became more difficult (caps introduced by British authorities), which led to a crisis of Réunion&#x27;s sugar cane industry. During the same period, the island was hit by several cyclones. Malaria also arrived in Réunion in 1868, three years after its arrival in Mauritius (both islands were malaria-free before the 1860s), and the disease became endemic in the island. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 as well as the French growing interest in colonizing Madagascar also marginalized Réunion. As a result of all these events, Saint-Denis entered a period of stagnation that lasted until World War II. The city even officially experienced population decline from the 1870s until the beginning of the 1920s, before recovering slightly after 1921 (see Demographics section).

In 1868, bitter press campaigns opposing local liberal (anti-clerical) and clerical (pro-Jesuit) newspapers degenerated when the editor-in-chief of the clerical newspaper &quot;La Malle&quot; was rumored to have sexually assaulted the son of a merchant from Saint-Denis. The rumor led to five days of anti-clerical riots in the city in November-December 1868, with crowds of up to 2,000 gathering in front of the bishop&#x27;s palace, shouting &quot;Down with &quot;La Malle&quot;! Down with the Jesuits!&quot;, and ransacking the college (high school) of the Jesuits. On 3 December governor Marie Jules Dupré ordered the dispersal of the unarmed anti-clerical crowd assembled on the square in front of the Saint-Denis Hôtel de Ville, and the troops opened fire, killing 9 people and injuring another 30 people. The next day, a state of siege was declared. The tragedy had nationwide repercussions in France in the dying days of the Second French Empire which opposed liberals and conservatives.
On 3 November 1870, after ships had brought the news of Napoleon III&#x27;s fall and proclamation of the French Republic in Paris, governor Louis Hippolyte de Lormel announced the proclamation of the French Republic in Saint-Denis. That same year, the first telegraph line in Réunion was established between Saint-Denis and the southern Réunionese subprefecture of Saint-Pierre, in length.

In December 1874, the Oudemans scientific mission sent by king William III of the Netherlands to Réunion to observe the transit of Venus established its observation camp at the seafront of Barachois, in Saint-Denis.

A railway tunnel dug in the big lava flow separating Saint-Denis from La Possession was started in 1878 and completed in 1881, allowing trains to connect Saint-Denis with the new seaport of La Réunion under construction at Le Port in replacement of the old harbor of Barachois in Saint-Denis. It was the third-longest tunnel in the world at the time. 

In 1891, the first streets in the centre of Saint-Denis started to be lit with electric lighting. In 1896, the first public screening with a movie projector of the Lumière brothers brought from Paris took place in the Saint-Denis city hall. In 1900 the first automobile arrived in Saint-Denis, a Peugeot car.

In 1896, the first Chinese temple in Réunion and in France was opened in Saint-Denis, the Chane temple (陈宅), also called Shichantang (世昌堂), dedicated to Guandi and to the ancestral worship of the Chane (陈) family, one of the Cantonese families arrived in Réunion in the 1860s and 1870s as Chinese labourers. In 1905 was inaugurated in Saint-Denis the Noor-e-Islam Mosque, the oldest mosque in France (outside of Mayotte), whose construction was authorized by the governor of Réunion in 1898 after several requests from the Muslim inhabitants of the island, Indians originally from Gujarat arrived in Réunion in the 1850s. The first Hindu temple in Saint-Denis, the Tamil , was inaugurated in 1917.

In 1897, queen Ranavalona III of Madagascar was deported to Saint-Denis, where she lived for two years before being deported to French Algeria. Sultan Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore was also exiled to Réunion where he lived in Saint-Denis in the end of the 1890s and beginning of the 1900s. The deposed emperor of Vietnam Thành Thái and his son the emperor Duy Tân were both exiled to Réunion by French authorities in 1916 and they lived in Saint-Denis until World War II. The Moroccan rebel leader Abd el-Krim, founder of the Republic of the Rif, was also exiled to Réunion in 1926 after his surrender to French troops, and he lived in Saint-Denis until 1929, before moving to Les Trois-Bassins.

In 1912, the , the museum of arts of Saint-Denis, was inaugurated in the colonial mansion which served as the bishop&#x27;s palace and had been seized by the French state the year before, following the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State.

The Spanish flu hit Saint-Denis in April and May 1919, killing thousands of people. During the Holy Week of 1919 alone, the Spanish flu killed nearly 1,000 people in Saint-Denis, a city which had less than 24,000 inhabitants at the time.

Radiotelegraphy services began operation in Saint-Denis in 1923, with a radiotelegraphy station opened in old military barracks at the Barachois. The first radio program broadcast to the public took place in 1927, and the first radio station, Radio Saint-Denis, went on the air in 1929.

In 1938, the old harbor of Le Barachois was filled to create a large square in order to host a large colonial exhibition. On 10 April 1940 the last public execution in Réunion took place at dawn on that square at the Barachois: two men were guillotined for the savage murder of a 78 year-old female shopkeeper in 1937. 

In June 1940, after the Fall of France, governor decided to declare his loyalty to Marshal Pétain, unlike the French colonial governors in the South Pacific surrounded by British territories, who chose to rally de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French, and he cut all communications with Mauritius. The British established a naval blockade of Réunion which led to severe food shortages and rationing. The governor pushed local authorities to follow Vichy France policies. In Saint-Denis, the square of Barachois was renamed square Marshal Pétain by the municipal council in February 1941. A Pétain Propaganda Committee was created in Saint-Denis in December 1941, as well as a Marshal Pétain Guard made up of 800 followers of the &quot;Révolution nationale&quot;. At the same time, an underground resistance movement started to organize itself. 
After the successful British landing in Vichy-held Madagascar, and faced with the impossibility to defend Réunion&#x27;s coastline, governor Aubert on 27 September 1942 decided to declare Saint-Denis an open city and retreat to Hell-Bourg, in the interior of the island. On 28 November the Free French Naval Forces (FNFL) destroyer &quot;Léopard&quot;, sailing from Mauritius, arrived off Saint-Denis and landed troops unopposed. These troops captured the city and established a Free French governor. Governor Aubert surrendered to the Free French governor on 30 November, thus completing the Liberation of Réunion. All Vichy policies enacted under governor Aubert were reversed in late 1942 and in 1943.

=== Urban expansion (1940s–1970s) ===
After World War II, Saint-Denis entered a new period of population growth and urban development. In February 1945, Air France opened an air route between Paris and Saint-Denis, the first air route linking Réunion with metropolitan France: operated once a week, it took 5 days and 14 stopovers to reach Paris from Saint-Denis. In June 1946, the newer Gillot airfield (now Roland Garros Airport, the international airport of Réunion) was inaugurated east of Saint-Denis&#x27;s city center, in the neighboring commune of Sainte-Marie. 

In March 1946, the colony of Réunion was turned into an overseas department of France, which led to the gradual alignment of its social and public services with those of metropolitan France. Malaria eradication campaigns, started in Réunion in 1949 thanks to the new DDT insecticide, led to a dramatic decrease of malaria prevalence in the space of four years, and its complete eradication by 1967. Malaria had acted as a brake on population growth since its arrival in the island in 1868, and with its eradication the island&#x27;s population soon started to grow tremendously due to high fertility rates. 

All these factors, combined with rural flight, led to a new period of rapid expansion for the city of Saint-Denis. After more than 70 years of stagnation, the city&#x27;s population more than doubled between the 1954 and 1967 censuses.

The June 1946 French legislative election was marked by political violence in Réunion, opposing Communist militants and the Christian-democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP), which had both emerged from the underground resistance during Vichy rule over the island (1940–1942). On 25 May 1946, in the heat of the campaign, Communist and MRP militants confronted each other in the city center of Saint-Denis, and , Gaullist and MRP leader, who was running in the 1st constituency of Réunion (the one including Saint-Denis), where he faced Raymond Vergès, a local Communist leader elected the year before mayor of Saint-Denis, was shot and killed in the mêlée. Paul Vergès, son of Raymond Vergès, and future founder of the Communist Party of Réunion (with which he led the regional council of Réunion from 1998 to 2010), was accused of having fired the fatal shot with a gun belonging to his father found on the scene. Found guilty by the criminal court of Lyon (where the trial had been relocated in order to calm tensions in Réunion), he was granted amnesty in 1953 by the French government.

In 1956 was begun the construction of a major road linking Saint-Denis and La Possession (and from there the seaport of Réunion and the western coast of the island), bypassing the big lava flow which had always impeded communications between Saint-Denis and the western coast of the island. Only a slow railway line built in 1878–1881 in a tunnel under the lava flow and a narrow, winding road climbing the lava flow existed until then, which hindered the economic development of Saint-Denis. The new road, built at the bottom of the cliffs almost at sea-level, took 7 years to complete and was opened to traffic in 1963. It was later enlarged as a 4-lane expressway between 1973 and 1976.

In 1957, a large modern hospital was opened in Saint-Denis, the , one of the results of the transformation of the colony into an overseas department in 1946.

The 1959 French municipal elections were once again marked by political violence in Réunion. In Saint-Denis, on election day (15 March 1959), a young Communist militant was shot and killed by a Gaullist militant, and another Communist militant was severely injured by the same gunman. Paul Vergès, who was the Communist candidate to become mayor of Saint-Denis, was beaten by Gendarmerie forces during clashes in the streets and left unconscious on the pavement. The Gaullist candidate, , was declared winner of the election, but the Communists accused the authorities of electoral fraud. This pushed Vergès to secede from the French Communist Party two months later and found the Communist Party of Réunion, which then campaigned for more autonomy from France. Yet in July 1959, Charles de Gaulle, president of France, received a warm welcome on his arrival to Saint-Denis, the first visit by a French head of state since the foundation of the city.

In 1961, the first modern hotel and the first supermarket opened in Saint-Denis. The city&#x27;s (and more generally the island&#x27;s) infrastructure, however, was still largely underdeveloped compared to metropolitan France, and many people lived in great poverty. In the countryside, people often resided in huts with bare earth floor, and the housing situation in the city was getting worse every year with the now rapidly growing population. De Gaulle&#x27;s prime minister Michel Debré, who had accompanied De Gaulle during his 1959 visit and witnessed the poverty and underdevelopment then prevalent in Réunion, feared that it would push the islanders towards asking independence from France, as had happened in the rest of Africa. After stepping down as prime minister in 1962 following the independence of French Algeria (to which he had been opposed), he was determined to prevent the same fate in Réunion, and decided to stand in the 1st constituency of Réunion by-election to the National Assembly in the beginning of 1963 (after the results of the 1962 French legislative election in that constituency, which the mayor of Saint-Denis Gabriel Macé had won, were invalidated by the Constitutional Council due to renewed electoral fraud).

Michel Debré decisively defeated his Communist rival Paul Vergès when the by-election took place in May 1963, and he became the leader of Réunion&#x27;s Gaullist and right-wing forces opposed to the autonomy of Réunion demanded by the local Communist Party. Debré used his connections in Paris to promote the economic development of the island and bring its housing and infrastructure closer to metropolitan French level, which benefited Saint-Denis as capital of the island. In 1964, the French National Assembly voted the so-called &#x27;Debré Law&#x27; (named after its promoter) that facilitated land expropriation and slum clearance in France&#x27;s urban areas. The law helped to eradicate the shanty towns that had started to appear in Saint-Denis and other Réunionese cities. The next year was launched the construction of large public housing projects (or council estates) in the neighborhood of , east of Saint-Denis&#x27;s city center, to rehouse the people evacuated from the shanty towns, as well as provide housing for low-income newcomers to the city arriving from the countryside. Construction of these projects, capable of housing close to 10,000 people, lasted until 1973.
In December 1964, the first TV station in Réunion opened in Saint-Denis, a local station of the national broadcaster ORTF (which has now become ), whose studios, located at the Barachois near the city center, produced local news programs. A university campus affiliated with the Aix-Marseille University was opened gradually in Saint-Denis between 1964 and 1970, later officially becoming the University of Reunion Island in 1982. In August 1967 the first nonstop commercial flights between Saint-Denis and Paris (operated by Air France&#x27;s Boeing 707) were launched after the lengthening and modernization of Gillot Airport&#x27;s runway. Saint-Denis&#x27;s new modernist city hall was constructed in the 1970s. The city hosted the first Indian Ocean Island Games in 1979 (which it hosted again in 1998 and 2015).

===1991 Chaudron riots===

Economic development and rising incomes, thanks to financial transfers from metropolitan France, led after the 1960s to a Westernization of the local culture and the emergence of a consumer society: TV sets became ubiquitous, large hypermarkets appeared on the outskirts of the city as in metropolitan French cities, selling many products imported from metropolitan France, and the ownership of motor vehicles became generalized, leading to heavy traffic during rush hours in a city whose public transports were not developed. The high level of unemployment and the high cost of living (in part due to imported goods from metropolitan France, as well as high salaries among the French state&#x27;s public servants) generated frustration and social tensions among a significant part of the city&#x27;s population with low incomes, who survived thanks to social benefits introduced after the transformation of Réunion into an overseas department in 1946, and who had difficult access to the consumer society and imported goods.
In 1991, that social tension exploded after the authorities decided to close a TV station, , which was broadcasting pirated B movies (action films and erotic movies in particular) and Reunionese Creole talk shows, particularly popular among low-income people. Télé Free Dom had been broadcasting from its studios in Saint-Denis without a license for more than 4 years when CSA, France&#x27;s electronic media regulatory authority, ordered it to cease operations. Despite protests from its viewers incited by the founder and owner of Télé Free Dom, a metropolitan Frenchman, the French government instructed the prefect of Réunion to seize the transmitter of the TV station on 24 February 1991. A month of riots throughout the city ensued after Télé Free Dom went off air, with their epicenter in the large projects of Le Chaudron built in the 1960s and 1970s. 

Hundreds of rioters threw stones at the police, and for several days they torched cars, looted and then set fire to banks, car dealerships, supermarkets, and large DIY and furniture stores in the retail parks on the outskirts of the city. Eight looters died on the night of 25–26 February 1991, trapped inside a burning furniture store, which led to a temporary lull in the riots, but they soon erupted again in March. A visit by prime minister Michel Rocard on 17 March failed to calm the situation down, and it was only after a visit by France&#x27;s first lady Danielle Mitterrand, who went to the projects at Le Chaudron to discuss with local residents and who promised to relay their grievances to the French president, that the riots finally ended on 24 March.

==Geography==
The city is located on the north end of the island, and was a port. Saint-Denis was &quot;originally the main port of Réunion, but an artificial harbour at Le Port, on the northwest coast, replaced it in the 1880s, because of unpredictable winds and tides at Saint-Denis.&quot; The city includes some of the island&#x27;s mountains, with a peak elevation of within the metro area, which begins at sea level at the coast line.

The city has many neighbourhoods:
Le Barachois, Bellepierre, Bois-de-Nèfles, La Bretagne (Le Cerf), Le Brûlé, Les Camélias, Centre-ville, Champ-Fleuri, La Montagne (Le Colorado, Ruisseau Blanc, Saint-Bernard), Montgaillard, La Providence, La Rivière Saint-Denis (La Redoute), Ruisseau des Noirs, Saint-François, Saint-Jacques, Sainte-Clotilde (Le Butor, le Chaudron, Commune Prima, Domenjod, Le Moufia), La Source, La Trinité, Vauban

=== Climate ===
Saint-Denis features a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) with two distinct seasons: a hot and humid wet season from December to April and a very warm, less humid drier season for the remaining seven months of the year, with June to October qualifying as true dry season months. The dry season does typically feature relatively light rain, but it is not wet enough to be a tropical rainforest climate. During the wet season, tropical cyclones often affect the city.


== Demographics ==
Saint-Denis is the most populous commune in the French overseas departments. The population of St Denis has grown substantially since 1954, both in the commune and the metropolitan area. In the 67 years from 1954 to the census in 2021, population has more than tripled. The annual rate of population growth has been lower in the 21st century than in the 20th century.


The places of birth of the 304,178 residents in the Saint-Denis metropolitan area at the 2015 census were the following:
*81.1% were born in Réunion
*11.1% in Metropolitan France 
*1.1% in Mayotte
*0.3% in other parts of Overseas France
*6.4% in foreign countries (notably Madagascar, the Union of the Comoros, and Mauritius); half of them were immigrants and the other half were children of French citizens born abroad (children of Réunionese settlers in Madagascar for example)

==Transport==
The closest airport is Roland Garros Airport, 7 km east of the city in Sainte-Marie, Réunion, which is also the main international airport of Réunion. Air Austral is the regional air carrier, with its Indian Ocean hub located at the airport. The airline has begun serving some cities in mainland France. Five or six other airlines serve the airport. There is a good road network in Saint-Denis.

On 15 March 2022 an aerial tramway, named Papang, started operating, stretching 2.7 km (approximately 1.67 mi) and serving 5 stations between the neighbourhoods of Le Chaudron and Bois-de-Nèfles.

== Places of worship == 
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Denis de La Réunion (Catholic Church), Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques.

==Education==
The University of Reunion Island admits 15,000 students each year, with 6 campus sites in Saint-Denis. Course work is aligned with European standards for university education. There is a school of engineering as well. The language is French, and there are connections with educational institutions in France on the continent of Europe.

The commune maintains various elementary schools for each sector.

==Economy==
IBM has an office in Saint-Denis. The island began organizing to be a digital hub for nearby African nations, relying on its two undersea cables for good internet connections. The potential for services would alter the island&#x27;s economy, now reliant on sugar, an agricultural product. The university in Saint-Denis has programs to educate the young population in digital skills. New businesses are forming to serve the needs of airlines for software.

<text>Matley Bog is an ancient woodland bog in the New Forest, Hampshire, England.

==Geography==
It is a sphagnum quaking bog with adjacent heather heathland. The stream that runs axially through the bog drains at its eastern end into the infant Beaulieu River.

==Biodiversity==
It is notable for the presence of the rare ant &quot;Formica candida&quot;, sometimes called the shining bog ant, which was discovered there in the early 20th century by Horace Donisthorpe. The wetter areas contain the rare and diminutive bog orchid, &quot;Hammarbya paludosa&quot;.

It is also home to a large population of raft spiders as well as the crab spider &quot;Thomisus onustus&quot;.

<doc id="330700" wikidata="Q160252" url="?curid=330700" title="Frederic Leighton">
<text>Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton, (3 December 1830 – 25 January 1896), known as Sir Frederic Leighton between 1878 and 1896, was a British Victorian painter, draughtsman, and sculptor. His works depicted historical, biblical, and classical subject matter in an academic style. His paintings were enormously popular and expensive, during his lifetime, but fell out of critical favour for many decades in the early 20th century.

Leighton was the bearer of the shortest-lived peerage in history; after only one day, his hereditary peerage became extinct upon his death.

==Biography==

Leighton was born in Scarborough to Augusta Susan and Dr. Frederic Septimus Leighton (1799–1892), a medical doctor. Leighton&#x27;s grandfather, Sir James Boniface Leighton (1769–1843), had been the primary physician to two Russian tsarsAlexander I and Nicholas Iand their families, and amassed a fortune while in their service. Leighton&#x27;s career was always cushioned by this family wealth, with his father paying him an allowance throughout his life. He had two sisters; one of them, Alexandra, was Robert Browning&#x27;s biographer. He was educated at University College School, London. He then received his artistic training on the European continent, first from Eduard von Steinle and then from Giovanni Costa. At age 17, in the summer of 1847, he met the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in Frankfurt and drew his portrait, in graphite and gouache on paper—the only known full-length study of Schopenhauer done from life. When he was 24 he was in Florence; he studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti, and painted the procession of the Cimabue Madonna through the Borgo Allegri. From 1855 to 1859 he lived in Paris, where he met Ingres, Delacroix, Corot, and Millet.

Travel was an important part of Leighton&#x27;s life from childhood. By his late teens, he was living with his family in Frankfurt, Germany and had already visited many of Europe&#x27;s major cities, including Florence and Rome, places which he would return to on a great many occasions over the next decades. By his late twenties, extended periods had been spent living in Rome and then Paris and Leighton had made his first trip outside Europe, travelling to north Africa in 1857. Once settled in London, he continued to make extensive trips every year until shortly before his death. The countries that Leighton visited on at least one occasion include Austria, Algeria, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Morocco, The Netherlands, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland, Syria, and Turkey.

In 1860, he moved to London, where he associated with the Pre-Raphaelites. He designed Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#x27;s tomb for Robert Browning in the English Cemetery, Florence in 1861. In 1864 he became an associate of the Royal Academy and in 1878 he became its President (1878–96). His 1877 sculpture, &quot;Athlete Wrestling with a Python&quot;, was considered at its time to inaugurate a renaissance in contemporary British sculpture, referred to as the New Sculpture. American art critic Earl Shinn claimed at the time that &quot;Except Leighton, there is scarce any one capable of putting up a correct frescoed figure in the archway of the Kensington Museum.&quot; His paintings represented Britain at the great 1900 Paris Exhibition. 

He was the first President of the Committee commissioning the Survey of London which documented the capital&#x27;s principal buildings and public art.

Leighton remained a bachelor; rumours of him having an illegitimate child with one of his models, in addition to the supposition that Leighton may have been homosexual, continue to be debated. He certainly enjoyed an intense and romantically tinged relationship with the poet Henry William Greville whom he met in Florence in 1856. The older man showered Leighton in letters, but the romantic affection seems not to have been reciprocated. Enquiry is further hindered by Leighton leaving no diaries, and his letters lack reference to his personal circumstances. No definite primary evidence has yet come to light that effectively dispels the secrecy that Leighton built up around himself, although it is clear that he did court a circle of younger men around his artistic studio.

Leighton was knighted at Windsor Castle in 1878, and was created a baronet eight years later. He was the first painter to be given a peerage, in the 1896 New Year Honours. The patent creating him Baron Leighton of Stretton, in the County of Shropshire, was issued on 24 January 1896; Leighton died the next day of angina pectoris. On his death his hereditary peerage was extinguished after existing for only a day; this is a record in the peerage.

His house in Holland Park, London has been turned into a museum, the Leighton House Museum. It contains many of his drawings and paintings, as well as some of his former art collection, including works by Old Masters and his contemporaries, such as a painting dedicated to Leighton by Sir John Everett Millais. The house also houses many of Leighton&#x27;s inspirations, including his collection of Iznik tiles. Its centrepiece is the magnificent Arab Hall, which is featured in issue ten of &quot;Cornucopia&quot;.
A blue plaque commemorates Leighton at Leighton House Museum.

==Artists Rifles==


Leighton was an enthusiastic volunteer soldier, enrolling with the first group to join the 38th Middlesex (Artists&#x27;) Rifle Volunteer Corps (later to be known as the Artists Rifles) on 5 October 1860.

His qualities of leadership were immediately identified, and he was promoted to command a Company within a few months. On 6 January 1869 Captain Leighton was elected to command the Artists Rifles by a general meeting of the corps. In the same year he was promoted to major and in 1875 to lieutenant colonel. Leighton resigned as commanding officer in 1883. The painter James Whistler famously described the then Sir Frederic Leighton, the commanding officer of the Artists Rifles, as the: &quot;Colonel of the Royal Academy and the President of the Artists Rifles – aye, and he paints a little!&quot; At his funeral, on 3 February 1896, his coffin was carried into St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, past a guard of honour formed by the Artists Rifles.

<text>The Murray-Latta Machine Company is a British Columbian machine manufacturing and steel fabrication company. In the 1960s and 1970s, they built a number of chairlifts, mainly in British Columbia. Although they no longer design or fabricate chairlifts, they still provide parts and act as contractors for constructing new lifts designed by other manufacturers.

The main reason Murray-Latta entered the skilift market in the first place can be attributed to Premier W. A. C. Bennett, who promoted British Columbian business. Using a British Columbian company to construct chairlifts at the government-owned ski areas at Cypress Mountain, Mount Seymour, and Manning Park (Gibson Pass) was a natural choice. 

The company also built lifts outside British Columbia at the Mt. Baker Ski Area (WA), Hyak ski area (now known as Summit East) on Snoqualmie Pass, Washington, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

The most notable design aspect of Murray-Latta chairlifts is the way the cable carrying the loaded chairs can sometimes sag as much as below the unloaded cable during long gaps between support towers.

<doc id="330721" wikidata="Q1929251" url="?curid=330721" title="Baptist World Alliance">
<text>The Baptist World Alliance (BWA) is an international Baptist association of Christian churches with an estimated 51 million people from 266 member bodies in 134 countries and territories as of 2024. A voluntary association of Baptist churches, the BWA accounts for about half the Baptists in the world. 

The BWA was founded in 1905 in London during an international congress of Baptist churches. Its headquarters are in Falls Church, Virginia, United States. It is led by general secretary and CEO Elijah M. Brown and by President Tomás Mackey.

==History==

The roots of the Baptist World Alliance can be traced back to the seventeenth century when Baptist leader Thomas Grantham proposed the concept of a congregation of all Christians in the world that are &quot;baptised according to the appointment of Christ.&quot; Similar proposals were put forward later such as the call of John Rippon in 1790 for a world meeting of Baptists &quot;to consult the ecclesiastical good to the whole.&quot;

It was, however, only in 1904 when such congregation became a reality. John Newton Prestridge, editor of &quot;The Baptist Argus&quot;, at Louisville, Kentucky called for a world gathering of Baptists. John Howard Shakespeare, editor of &quot;The Baptist Times and Freeman&quot;, London, endorsed the proposal. In October 1904, the Baptist Union of Great Britain passed a resolution to invite a Congress to meet with them in 1905. At the Congress, a committee was formed, which proposed a &quot;Constitution for a World Alliance&quot;. The Baptist World Alliance was founded in London, during this first Baptist World Congress in July 1905. Every five years since, the BWA holds a Baptist World Congress in different locations around the world, and multiple international meeting and programs are held in the times between Congresses. 

The gathering was referred to as an &quot;alliance&quot; and not a council in order to establish the nature of the dialogue as a meeting. This means that the body wields no authority over participating churches or national Baptist unions, serving only as a forum for collaboration.

In 2003, the International Baptist Convention, an international association of English-speaking churches, became a member. 

In 2004, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention voted to withdraw from the Baptist World Alliance (BWA) over issues regarding the alleged adoption of liberal stances such as the inclusion of conventions that allow same sex marriage as well as perceived anti-American sentiment, which were partly attributed to Alliance Secretary General Denton Lotz&#x27;s visits to Fidel Castro in Cuba. A year later, two state denominational members of the Southern Baptist Convention—the Baptist General Association of Virginia and the Baptist General Convention of Texas—affirmed their continued support and applied for membership in the Alliance, and were subsequently admitted.

In 2020, the Argentine Pastor Tomás Mackey succeeded South African Pastor Paul Msiza as BWA President.

==Statistics==
According to a census published by the association in 2024, the BWA has 266 participating Baptist fellowships in 134 countries, with 178,000 churches and 51,000,000 baptized members. These statistics may not fully representative, however, since some churches in the United States have dual or triple national Baptist affiliation, possibly causing a church and its members to be counted by more than one Baptist association, if these associations are members of the BWA.

== Beliefs ==
The Alliance has a Baptist confession of faith.

==Structure==
The Alliance is divided into six regional or geographical fellowships: North American Baptist Fellowship, Caribbean Baptist Fellowship, Latin American Baptist Union, European Baptist Federation, Asia Pacific Baptist Federation, and All-Africa Baptist Fellowship. Each regional fellowship is served by an Executive Secretary.

===List of general secretaries===
In the initial stages of the Baptist World Alliance, the role of General Secretary was split into two geographical regions. In 1928, these positions were merged into a single general secretary role.

===List of presidents===
==Baptist World Congress==
Baptist World Congresses have been held every few years since 1905.

==Affiliated organizations==
=== Global Baptist Mission Network ===
The Global Baptist Mission Network has 23 member mission organizations.

=== BWAid ===
BWAid supports humanitarian aid projects.

=== BFAD ===
BWA Forum for Aid and Development (BFAD) brings together 30 Baptist humanitarian agencies.

==Ecumenical relations==
The Baptist World Alliance is involved in ecumenical dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church and the World Methodist Council, among others. One series of International Conversations between the BWA and the Catholic Church took place from between 1984 and 1988 moderated by the Reverend Dr David T. Shannon, sometime President of Andover Newton Theological School, and the Most Reverend Bede Heather, Bishop of Parramatta. While this dialogue produced the report called &quot;Summons to Witness to Christ in Today&#x27;s World&quot;, the second phase did not push through because of opposition from within the Baptist World Alliance itself. Negotiations continued, however, so that a series of consultations transpired from 2000 to 2003. During this period the Baptists and Catholics discussed important doctrines that divide these denominations. These second series of conversations resulted in formal meetings between 2006 and 2010. The current Co-Moderators are Paul Fiddes, Professor of Systematic Theology in the University of Oxford and formerly Principal of Regent&#x27;s Park College, Oxford, and Arthur J. Serratelli, Bishop of Paterson.

<doc id="330722" wikidata="Q1365567" url="?curid=330722" title="Pringlea">
<text>Pringlea antiscorbutica, commonly known as Kerguelen cabbage, is a flowering plant and the sole member of the monotypic genus Pringlea in the family Brassicaceae. Its common name comes from the archipelago of its discovery, the Kerguelen Islands, and its generic name derives from Sir John Pringle, president of the Royal Society at the time of its discovery by Captain James Cook&#x27;s Surgeon, William Anderson in 1776.

Despite its appearance and edibility, it is not related to the common broadleaf plantain.

== Description ==
Pringlea has leaf rosettes of up to 45 cm in diameter, that sit on top of perennial half woody stems of about 15 cm thick and up to 1 m long. The erect flowering stems remain on the plants for many years.

== Distribution ==
The species grows on the remote Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Crozet, Prince Edward and Kerguelen Islands. The ancestor of &quot;P. antiscorbutica&quot; probably migrated from South America some five million years ago.


== Ecology==
The home islands of Kerguelen cabbage are at roughly 50° south latitude and constantly buffeted by strong winds, making the islands unfavorable for wind pollination, except on infrequent mild days. This climate, plus the absence of potential insect pollinators, means the Kerguelen cabbage can only survive through a process of self-pollination.
The plants grow to a diameter of about 50 cm in around four years, and flower for the first time in their third or fourth year. At the mature stage, this species exhibits several adaptations linked to cold tolerance such as high polyamine levels. &quot;Pringlea&quot; has a very high leaf water content (above 83%) and the waterflow from the root to the leaves is very easy, which is no problem since soil water content on the distribution area of Kerguelen cabbage is permanently high. This implies that successfully growing this species elsewhere is difficult.

==Uses==
The plant is edible, containing high levels of potassium. Its leaves contain a vitamin C-rich oil, a fact which, in the days of sailing ships, made it very attractive to sailors suffering from scurvy, hence the specific epithet &quot;antiscorbutica&quot;, which means &quot;against scurvy&quot; in Low Latin. It was essential to the diets of the whalers on Kerguelen when pork, beef, or seal meat was used up. In May 1840, botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker was the first to make a technical analysis of the plant, and to assign the Latin name.

Hooker also reported having eaten some soup that had been made with Kerguelen cabbage, and described the raw leaves as tasting like cress, the boiled leaves as tasting like &quot;stale&quot; cabbage, and the root as tasting like horseradish.

==Conservation==
The micropezid fly species &quot;Calycopteryx mosleyi&quot; is associated with this plant. Rabbits which were introduced on the Kerguelen around 1874, feed on the cabbage, and the plant is now limited to locations that cannot be accessed by them. Fortunately, rabbits are not present on all islands.

<text>Chappaquiddick Island ( ; Massachusett language: &quot;tchepi-aquidenet&quot;; colloquially known as &quot;Chappy”) is a peninsula and occasional island off the eastern end of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Norton Point, a narrow barrier beach, connects Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Chappaquiddick between Katama and Wasque (). Breaches occur due to hurricanes and strong storms separating the islands for periods of time. The two islands most recently reconnected on December 31, 2023. While both land forms have mostly been connected to one another in modern history, Chappaquiddick is nevertheless referred to as an island.

Visitors come to the isolated island for beaches, cycling, hiking, nature tours and birding, and the MyToi Gardens, a small Japanese garden created amidst the native brush. Two fire trucks are stationed on the island from Edgartown. Chappaquiddick Road and Poucha Road, both paved, provide access to sandy, woodland roads, trails, and shorelines.

Chappaquiddick became internationally known following an incident of the same name in 1969, when U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy accidentally drove his car off the island&#x27;s Dike Bridge into Poucha Pond. Kennedy&#x27;s 28-year-old passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, suffocated inside the car.

==Name and early settlement==
The name Chappaquiddick comes from a Native American word &quot;cheppiaquidne&quot; meaning &quot;separated island&quot;, so named because this island is separated from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard by a narrow strait or gut. The island has been historically spelled &quot;Chaubaqueduck&quot; or, alternatively, &quot;Chappaquidgick&quot;.

The island was once mainly the home territory of the Chappaquiddick band of the Wampanoag people, and remained exclusively theirs well into the nineteenth century. They still have a reservation of about (40 hectares) of brush land in the interior.

Early colonists settled Edgartown in 1642, and quickly proclaimed Chappaquiddick as village property. The first homes owned by people of exclusively European descent were built around 1750; these residents raised livestock and farmed the land.

==Geography==
The United States Census Bureau defines it as Block Group 1, Census Tract 2003 of Dukes County, Massachusetts. It has 15.915 km2 (6.145 sq mi) of land. Administratively, it is part of the town of Edgartown and Dukes County.

The Trustees of Reservations, a non-profit conservation organization, owns and manages nearly of land from the southeastern point, Wasque, to Cape Poge, at the northeast. Wasque is a popular fishing spot for catching bluefish, striped bass, and other species. The Cape Poge Lighthouse, first erected in 1801, has served ships navigating the shoals and shallows of Muskeget Channel.

Chappaquiddick is mainly defined by its diverse land and water ecologies with expansive salt marshes, ponds, red cedar woods, grassy meadows, and coastal wildlife including sandpipers, piping plovers, blue heron, osprey, and oysters. The main interior bodies of water include Cape Poge Bay, Katama Bay, and Poucha Pond, all salty.

While the island has continually faced shifting coastlines due to ocean currents, storm surges, and astronomical tides, the 21st century has presented new erosion challenges, particularly to Wasque Point which, during the Patriots&#x27; Day Storm of 2007, was battered severely. Between 2007 and 2013, approximately of land were lost at Wasque, where currents eroded bluffs, swallowed Swan Pond, damaged shoreline trails, and threatened a residence.

== The Occasional Island ==

==Population==
The 2020 census reported 253 residents on Chappaquiddick, up from 179 in 2010. The racial makeup was 92% White, 1% Native American, 1% Asian, and 4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1% of the population.

Socially, its residents form a tight-knit community and see themselves as distinctly separate from the rest of Edgartown. Longtime residents speak of &quot;going to the mainland&quot; when they travel to Edgartown and of &quot;going to America&quot; when (for example) they travel to Boston or Cape Cod.

Access to the island is served by privately owned barge-like ferries named the &quot;On Time II&quot; and &quot;On Time III&quot; which shuttle pedestrians, bicycles, and up to three cars at a time between Chappaquiddick and Edgartown, on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Two ferries run during the summer months and one during the off-season. Oversand access is possible with four-wheel drive vehicles and on foot on the south shore when the islands are connected and conditions permit.

==Ted Kennedy incident==
Chappaquiddick Island gained international attention on July 19, 1969, when the body of Mary Jo Kopechne was discovered inside an overturned Oldsmobile 88 off Dike Bridge in Poucha Pond. The car belonged to U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who claimed that he had taken a wrong turn and accidentally driven it off a bridge late the previous night. He did not report the accident to the police for ten hours. A January 1970 judicial inquest into Kopechne&#x27;s death found that Kennedy&#x27;s turn toward the bridge was intentional, and he operated his car in a manner &quot;at least negligent and possibly reckless&quot;. A grand jury investigation was held in April 1970; no indictments were issued. Dike Bridge was closed until 1995. In 2017, a film based on the incident was released with many scenes filmed on Chappaquiddick itself and in Edgartown.

<doc id="330733" wikidata="Q19968954" url="?curid=330733" title="Arowana">
<text>Arowanas are freshwater bony fish of the subfamily Osteoglossinae, also known as bony tongues (the latter name is now often reserved for Arapaiminae). In this family of fish, the head is bony and the elongated body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name &quot;bonytongues&quot; is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the &quot;tongue&quot;, equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The arowana is a facultative air breather and can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into its swim bladder, which is lined with capillaries like lung tissue.

==Evolution==
Within Osteoglossinae, the South America &quot;Osteoglossum&quot; arowanas diverged from the Asian and Australian &quot;Scleropages&quot; arowanas about 170 Mya, during the Middle Jurassic.

The Osteoglossidae are the only exclusively freshwater fish family found on both sides of the Wallace Line. This may be explained by the theory that Asian arowanas (&quot;S. formosus&quot;) diverged from the Australian &quot;Scleropages&quot;, &quot;S. jardinii&quot; and &quot;S. leichardti&quot;, about 140 Mya, making it likely that Asian arowanas were carried to Asia on the Indian subcontinent.

==Fossil record==
At least five extinct genera, known only from fossils, are classified as osteoglossids; these date back at least as far as the Late Cretaceous. Other fossils from as far back as the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous are widely considered to belong to the arowana superorder Osteoglossomorpha. Osteoglossomorph fossils have been found on all continents except Antarctica. These fossil genera include &quot;Brychaetus&quot;, &quot;Joffrichthys&quot;, and &quot;Phareodus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
* Genus †&quot;Anaedopogon&quot; 
* Genus †&quot;Foreyichthys&quot; 
* Genus †&quot;Nieerkunia&quot; 
* Genus †&quot;Osteoglossidarum&quot; [otolith]
* Genus †&quot;Ridewoodichthys&quot; 
* Genus †&quot;Taverneichthys&quot; 
* Genus †&quot;Tetoriichthys&quot; 
* Genus †&quot;Phareodus&quot; 
* Subfamily Osteoglossinae 
** Genus &quot;Scleropages&quot; 
** Genus &quot;Osteoglossum&quot; 

==Behavior==
Osteoglossids are carnivorous, often being specialized surface feeders. They are excellent jumpers; &quot;Osteoglossum&quot; species have been seen leaping more than from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname &quot;water monkeys&quot;. Arowana species typically grow to around in captivity.

Arowanas can be troublesome to keep as pets. They are expensive, require wide living space, are picky eaters, and need a lot of care. Arowanas are renowned for their aggressive behavior and personality.

Several species of osteoglossids exhibit parental care. They build nests and protect their young after they hatch. All species are mouthbrooders, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent&#x27;s mouth to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently.

Unlike most fishes that start reproducing at around six months of age, the arowana usually takes three to four years to reach sexual maturity.

==In the aquarium==
Depending on the classification system used, there are ten types of arowana commonly kept as pets: four from Asia, three from South America, two from Australia, and one from Africa.

Asian arowana is an endangered species and banned in the United States. It is a status symbol among wealthy Asian men. An albino arowana sold for a record price of $300,000 in 2009. Most pet arowana are farmed behind high-security fences.

Arowanas are solitary fish and only allow company while young; adults may show dominance and aggression. Some compatible species often partnered with this fish are clown knifefish, pacu, oscars, jaguar cichlids, green terrors, gar, tinfoil barb, Siamese tigerfish, and any other somewhat aggressive fish that cannot fit in the arowana&#x27;s mouth. These fish are best kept with live or frozen feed and they easily outgrow the tank within eight to ten months. An aquarium with the minimum diameter of and is suggested as a bare minimum but is the best way to go. Australian species are best kept alone in aquaria.

It is estimated that the total annual revenue of the Asian arowana sector was over US$200 million globally since 2012.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the Tupí language &quot;arua&#x27;ná&quot;, &quot;aruanã&quot;, or &quot;arauaná&quot;.

<doc id="330737" wikidata="Q459371" url="?curid=330737" title="Rebecca Lobo">
<text>Rebecca Rose Lobo-Rushin (born October 6, 1973) is an American television basketball analyst and former professional women&#x27;s basketball player in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 1997 to 2003. Lobo, at 6&#x27;4&quot;, played the center position for much of her career. She played college basketball at the University of Connecticut, where she was a member of the team that won the 1995 national championship, going 35–0 on the season in the process. She was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. In April 2017, she was one of the members of the 2017 class of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, alongside Tracy McGrady and Muffet McGraw.

==Early life==
Lobo was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the youngest daughter of RuthAnn (née Hardy) and Dennis Joseph Lobo. Her father is of Cuban descent, while her mother was of German and Irish heritage. Lobo was raised a Catholic. Her brother Jason played basketball at Dartmouth College and her sister Rachel played basketball at Salem State College. Lobo&#x27;s mother and father were both teachers; her father also coached basketball and track and field. Raised in Southwick, Massachusetts, Lobo was the state scoring record-holder with 2,740 points in her high school career for Southwick-Tolland Regional High School in Massachusetts. She held this record for 18 years until it was surpassed by Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir of the new Leadership Charter School in Springfield on January 26, 2009.

==College career==
More than 100 colleges recruited Lobo, but she chose the University of Connecticut due to its proximity and her belief in its academic excellence. She helped lead the Huskies to the 1995 National Championship with an undefeated 35–0 record. In her senior year, Lobo was the unanimous national player of the year, winning the 1995 Naismith College Player of the Year award, the Wade Trophy, the AP Player of the Year award, the USBWA Player of the Year award, the Honda Sports Award for basketball, and the WBCA Player of the Year award. She was awarded the prestigious Honda-Broderick Cup for 1994–95, presented to the athlete &quot;most deserving of recognition as the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year&quot;. She was a member of the inaugural class of inductees to the University of Connecticut women&#x27;s basketball &quot;Huskies of Honor&quot; recognition program. The Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation named Lobo the 1995 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category). She was the first player in the Big East Conference to earn first-team all-American honors for both basketball and academics.

==USA Basketball==
Lobo was named to the USA U18 team (then called the Junior World Championship Qualifying Team) in 1992. The team competed in Guanajuato, Mexico in August 1992. The team won their first four games, then lost 80–70 to Brazil, finishing with the silver medal for the event, but qualifying for the 1993 world games. Lobo averaged 6.8 points per game during the event.

Lobo continued with the team to the 1993 U19 World Championship (then called the Junior World Championship). The team won five games and lost two, but that left them in seventh place. Lobo averaged 7.7 points per game and recorded six blocks, highest on the team.

In 1995, Lobo passed through tryouts to join the national team, which later became the US team for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, GA. Though her minutes on the floor were few, Lobo shared in the gold medal.

==Professional career==
In 1997, the WNBA was formed and enjoyed its inaugural season, and Lobo was assigned to the New York Liberty during the league&#x27;s first player allocations on January 22, 1997. Her debut game was played on June 21, 1997, in a 67 - 57 victory over the Los Angeles Sparks where she recorded 16 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists. In her first season, the Liberty fell to the Houston Comets in the WNBA Finals.

Lobo remained a centerpiece of the Liberty in the 1998 season, averaging 11.7 points and 6.9 rebounds as the Liberty finished 18 - 12. Although they had a great record, the Liberty would not make the playoffs in 1998 due to being 5th in the league standings and only the top 4 teams made the playoffs. The Charlotte Sting also had a 18 - 12 record, but made it in the playoffs over the Liberty due to having a better Conference record (11 - 5 to New York&#x27;s 8 - 8).

Lobo suffered a setback in 1999, tearing her left anterior cruciate ligament and her meniscus in the first game of the season. In 1999, she was selected to the inaugural WNBA All Star team but could not play because of the injury. In December, she reinjured her knee and ended missing all of the 2000 season.

Lobo returned during the 2001 season but played sparingly, only 85 minutes in total.

In January 2002, during the WNBA offseason, Lobo joined the Springfield Spirit in the National Women&#x27;s Basketball League.

On April 3, 2002, the Liberty traded her to the Houston Comets in exchange for Houston&#x27;s second-round selection (26th overall) in the 2002 WNBA draft (the Liberty would use the pick to draft Linda Fröhlich).

During the WNBA offseason, Lobo returned again to the Spirit. In her first game of the season in February 2003, she had 25 points and 14 rebounds.

On February 14, 2003, Lobo was traded to the Connecticut Sun for a 2003 second-round pick (which the Comets used to select Lori Nero). Lobo played in 29 games for the Sun, averaging 2.4 points and 2.1 rebounds. Her final WNBA game ever was played in Game 2 of the 2003 Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Shock on September 7, 2003. Lobo recorded 9 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 blocks but the Sun lost the game 73 - 79 and would be eliminated from the playoffs. Lobo would announce her retirement on September 23, 2003.

Lobo also played two seasons in the National Women&#x27;s Basketball League with the Springfield Spirit from 2002 through 2003.

== Broadcast career ==

Today, Lobo is a reporter and color analyst for ESPN with a focus on women&#x27;s college basketball and WNBA games.

Lobo faced criticism for her commentary during an April 1, 2024, NCAA women&#x27;s basketball Elite Eight game between the Iowa Hawkeyes and LSU Tigers in Albany, New York, after she remarked during an exchange with ESPN announcer Ryan Ruocco, &quot;And, by the way, good luck finding something to do in Albany.&quot; Lobo has since apologized to the city of Albany.

== Breast cancer advocate and health spokesperson ==
In 1996, Lobo and her late mother, Ruth Ann Lobo, collaborated on a book entitled &quot;The Home Team&quot;, which dealt with Ruth Ann&#x27;s battle with breast cancer. They also founded the Ruth Ann and Rebecca Lobo Scholarship, which offers a scholarship to the UConn School of Allied Health for Hispanic students. Lobo was the 1996 spokesperson for the Lee National Denim Day fundraiser which raises millions of dollars for breast cancer research and education.

Starting in 2000, Lobo served as national spokesperson and backer for Body1.com, a consumer-targeted network of sites providing interactive content-rich information on medical technologies that treat ailments and diseases specific to body parts. Due to her recurring problems with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), she campaigned to raise awareness of knee injury risks in women. She shared her story with others suffering from the same type of injury and advocated for patient self-education via the Internet.

== Personal life ==
On April 12, 2003, Lobo changed her last name to Lobo-Rushin after marrying &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Steve Rushin at the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. They have three daughters and one son.

== Ball &amp; Chain Podcast ==
Lobo and Rushin host the weekly &quot;Ball &amp; Chain Podcast&quot;, where they discuss current events, sports and family life. They released its first episode on October 23, 2017.
