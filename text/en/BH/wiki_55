<text>A trench coat is a variety of coat made of waterproof heavy-duty fabric, originally developed for British Army officers before the First World War, and becoming popular while used in the trenches, hence the name &quot;trench coat.&quot;

Originally made from gabardine, a worsted wool fabric waterproofed using lanolin before weaving, the traditional colour of a trench coat was khaki.

Traditionally trench coats are double-breasted with 10 front buttons, wide lapels, a storm flap, and pockets that button-close. The coat is belted at the waist with a self-belt, with raglan sleeves ending in cuff straps around the wrists that also buckle, to keep water from running down the forearm when using binoculars in the rain. The coat often has epaulettes that button-close, which were functional in a military context.

The trench coat was typically worn as a windbreaker or as a rain jacket, and not for sole protection from the cold in winter. Although some may feature a removable wool liner for additional warmth, they are usually not as warm as an overcoat. Period advertisements from the First World War reveal that the trench coat was sized to wear over the British Warm, to offer water protection when the temperature was cold enough to require the heavier coat, which explains the traditionally generous sizing of trench coats. Makers in recent years have resized trench coats downwards to conform more closely to overcoat sizing, as two coats would rarely be worn together today.

Popularised by film stars such as Humphrey Bogart, and Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther films, the trench coat has become a fashion staple, available in many colours, through brands such as Burberry.

==History==

=== First World War===
The trench coat was developed as an alternative to the heavy serge greatcoats worn by British and French soldiers in the First World War. Invention of the trench coat is claimed by two British luxury clothing manufacturers, Burberry and Aquascutum, with Aquascutum&#x27;s claim dating back to the 1850s. Thomas Burberry had invented gabardine fabric in 1879 and submitted a design for a British Army officer&#x27;s raincoat to the War Office in 1901.

The trench coat became an optional item of dress in the British Army, and was obtained by private purchase by officers and Warrant Officers Class I who were under no obligation to own them. No other ranks were permitted to wear them. Another optional item was the British Warm, a wool coat similar to the greatcoat that was shorter in length, also worn by British officers and Warrant Officers Class I as an optional piece.

During the First World War, the design of the trench coat was modified to include epaulettes and D-rings. The shoulder straps were for the attachment of epaulettes or other rank insignia; the D-ring was originally used for attaching map cases, swords, or other equipment to the belt, and there is a popular myth that it was for the attachment of hand grenades.

This latter design was dubbed &quot;trench coat&quot; by the soldiers in the front line. Many trench coats had large pockets for maps, and cleverly placed flaps and vents to deal with the odour associated with earlier rubber coats.

A range of waterproof coats was designed and sold during wartime that incorporated War Office requirements with traditional aspects of leisurewear. What became known as the &quot;trench coat&quot; combined the features of a military waterproof cape and the regulation greatcoat designed for British officers. Many veterans returning to civilian life kept the coats, which became fashionable for both men and women.

===Second World War ===

During the Second World War, officers of the United Kingdom continued to use the trench coat on the battlefield in inclement weather. Other nations also developed trench coat style jackets, notably the United States and the Soviet Union, and other armies of continental Europe such as Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland (and are often seen in war zone photographs in the 1939-40 era, even being worn by troops on the attack). As the war progressed, shorter &quot;field jackets&quot; became more popular, such as the Denison smock worn by British commandos, paratroopers, and snipers, and the M1941/M1943 field jackets in the US Army: these shorter garments allowed more mobility.

===Later===
Trench coats have remained fashionable in the decades following the Second World War. Their original role as part of an army officer&#x27;s uniform lent the trench coat a businesslike respectability, although many prefer to tie the belt instead of buckling it, for a more casual look. Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s Rick Blaine from &quot;Casablanca&quot; and Peter Sellers&#x27; Inspector Clouseau wore the trench coat in the public eye. In colder weather it is often worn with a hat such as a fedora or ushanka.

While similar, the heavy metal and Goth fashion trend of black oilcloth dusters are incorrectly referred to as trench coats. Early media reports of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre initially associated the perpetrators (Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold) with the school&#x27;s &quot;Trenchcoat Mafia&quot;, a clique who allegedly wore conspicuous black Australian oilcloth dusters. In the copycat W. R. Myers High School shooting days later, it was rumoured the shooter had worn a trench coat. In the wake of these incidents, many public schools in the US forbade students from wearing trench coats, both for their cultural associations and because they could conceal weapons.

<doc id="331170" wikidata="Q266449" url="?curid=331170" title="All men are created equal">
<text>The quotation &quot;all men are created equal&quot; is found in the United States Declaration of Independence and is a phrase that has come to be seen as emblematic of America&#x27;s founding ideals. The final form of the sentence was stylized by Benjamin Franklin, and penned by Thomas Jefferson during the beginning of the Revolutionary War in 1776. It reads:

Drawing from Enlightenment philosophy, the phrase reflects the influence of John Locke&#x27;s second treatise on government, particularly his belief in the inherent equality and individual liberty. Similar ideas can be traced back to earlier works, including medieval and classical sources, which emphasized the dignity and worth of all human beings. Jefferson applied the concept in his original draft of the declaration. The phrase was subsequently quoted and incorporated into the speeches and writings of prominent figures throughout American political and social history. It has been called an &quot;immortal declaration&quot;, and &quot;perhaps [the] single phrase&quot; of the American Revolutionary period with the greatest &quot;continuing importance.&quot;

==Origins==
The phrase is attested as early as pope Gregory the Great in book XXI of his Moralia in Job, and was picked up by Thomas Aquinas, Azo, Hervaeus Natalis, and other medieval thinkers.

Thomas Jefferson, through his friendship with Marquis de Lafayette, was heavily influenced by French philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu. In their often censored writings, those philosophers advocated that men were born free and equal. This later led to the French Revolution of 1789 and the concept of Human Rights (Droits de l&#x27;Homme in French).
At the age of 33, Jefferson borrowed the expression from an Italian friend and neighbor, Filippo Mazzei. In 1773‚Äì1785, Filippo Mazzei, a physician, philosopher, diplomat, and author, published a pamphlet containing the phrase, which Jefferson incorporated essentially intact into the Declaration of Independence:

Translated by Jefferson as follow:

Jefferson also may have been influenced by Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense&quot;, which was published in early 1776:

 In English history there exist earlier uses of nearly the same phrase. First by the medieval priest John Ball who at the outbreak of the 1381 Peasants Revolt in his famous sermon posited the question &quot;When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?&quot; and proclaimed &quot;From the beginning all men by nature were created alike&quot;. In his 1690 work Second Treatise of Government the philosopher John Locke argues that in the &quot;state of nature&quot; that existed before the formation of governments all men were created equal. Another example is in John Milton&#x27;s 1649 book called The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, written after the First English Civil War to defend the actions and rights of the Parliamentary cause, in the wake of the execution of king Charles I. The English poet says: &quot;No man who knows ought, can be so stupid to deny that all men naturally were borne free, being the image and resemblance of God himself ... born to command and not to obey: and that they liv&#x27;d so&quot;.

In 1776, the Second Continental Congress asked Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Robert Livingston, and Roger Sherman to write the Declaration of Independence. This Committee of Five voted to have Thomas Jefferson write the document. After Jefferson finished he gave the document to Franklin to proof. Franklin suggested minor changes, one of which stands out far more than the others: &quot;We hold these truths to be sacred and un-deniable...&quot; became &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident.&quot;

The second paragraph of the United States Declaration of Independence starts: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.-- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.&quot;

The Virginia Declaration of Rights, chiefly authored by George Mason and approved by the Virginia Convention on June 12, 1776, contains the wording: &quot;all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights of which . . . they cannot deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&quot; George Mason was an elder-planter who had originally stated John Locke&#x27;s theory of natural rights: &quot;All men are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent natural rights of which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&quot; Mason&#x27;s draft was accepted by a small committee and then rejected by the Virginia Convention. Thomas Jefferson, a competent Virginia lawyer, saw this as a problem in legal writing and chose words that were more acceptable to the Second Continental Congress.

The Massachusetts Constitution, chiefly authored by John Adams in 1780, contains in its Declaration of Rights the wording: &quot;All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.&quot;

The plaintiffs in the cases of &quot;Brom and Bett v. John Ashley&quot; and &quot;Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison&quot; argued that this provision abolished slavery in Massachusetts. The latter case resulted in a &quot;sweeping declaration . . . that the institution of slavery was incompatible with the principles of liberty and legal equality articulated in the new Massachusetts Constitution&quot;.

The phrase has since been considered a hallmark statement in democratic constitutions and similar human rights instruments, many of which have adopted the phrase or variants thereof.

==Criticism==
=== Early ===
In the early 19th century, Senator John Randolph of Roanoke criticized the phrase, stating that it is &quot;a falsehood, and a most pernicious falsehood, even though I find it in the Declaration of Independence&quot;. John C. Calhoun agreed, saying that there was &quot;not a word of truth&quot; in the phrase. In 1853 and in the context of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Senator John Pettit, said that the phrase was not a &quot;self-evident truth&quot; but a &quot;self-evident lie&quot;. These men were all either slave owners or supporters of slavery.

Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens also criticized the sentence in 1861 in his Cornerstone Speech, calling it a &quot;false idea&quot; and noting that the Confederate States were founded &quot;upon exactly the opposite idea&quot;, specifically outlined as white supremacy and the position of African Americans as subordinate.

=== Contemporary ===
Howard Zinn and others have written that the phrase is sexist. Zinn says that the use of the word &quot;men&quot;, to the exclusion of women, indicated the women were &quot;beyond consideration as worthy of inclusion&quot; and &quot;they were simply overlooked in any consideration of political rights, any notions of civic equality&quot;. However, others argue that in the 1700s, the word &quot;men&quot; was sometimes used to denote both genders&quot;.&quot; According to the Library of Congress, most people have interpreted &quot;all men&quot;&quot;&quot; to mean humanity and, within the context of the times, it is clear that &quot;all men&quot; meant &quot;humanity&quot;.

It has also been criticised on grounds of racism. Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;the white men who drafted those words did not believe them to be true for the hundreds of thousands of black people in their midst.&quot; Historian Nicholas Guyatt has criticized the &quot;long exile of blacks and Indians from &#x27;all men are created equal&#x27;&quot; and historian John Hope Franklin also states that &quot;Jefferson didn&#x27;t mean it when he wrote that all men are created equal. We&#x27;ve never meant it. The truth is we&#x27;re a bigoted people and always have been&quot;.

Richard M. Weaver, in one of the cornerstone works of traditional conservatism, &quot;Ideas Have Consequences&quot; (1948), paraphrased a 19th-century writer, stating that &quot;no man was ever created free and no two men [were] ever created equal&quot;. He continued: &quot;The comity of peoples in groups large or small rests not upon this chimerical notion of equality but upon fraternity, a concept which long antedates it in history because it goes immeasurably deeper in human sentiment. The ancient feeling of brotherhood carries obligations of which equality knows nothing. It calls for respect and protection, for brotherhood is status in family, and family is by nature hierarchical.&quot;

=== Slavery ===
The contradiction between the claim that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; and the existence of American slavery, including Thomas Jefferson himself owning slaves, attracted comment when the Declaration of Independence was first published. Before final approval, Congress, having made a few alterations to some of the wording, also deleted nearly a fourth of the draft, including a passage criticizing the slave trade. At that time many other members of Congress also owned slaves, which clearly factored into their decision to delete the controversial &quot;anti-slavery&quot; passage.

Jefferson argued many cases to free enslaved people. In &quot;Howell v. Netherland&quot; (April 1770), the most famous of these, Jefferson argued for the freedom of Samuel Howell, a mixed-race indentured servant, but was unsuccessful. In writing the declaration, Jefferson believed the phrase &quot;all men are created equal&quot; to be self-evident, and would ultimately resolve slavery. In 1776, abolitionist Thomas Day wrote: &quot;If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.&quot; The phrase was further used by Martin Luther King Jr. in his 1963 &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, emphasizing it as part of the &quot;American dream&quot; which he hoped would someday be fulfilled.

=== Responses to criticism ===

==== Early ====
Senator Benjamin Wade defended the phrase in 1854, stating that all men are created equal in the sense that they are &quot;equal in point of right&quot; so &quot;no man has a right to trample upon another&quot;. According to Abraham Lincoln, the founders did not mean that &quot;all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity&quot; but rather that everyone was equal in having &quot;certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot;.

==== Contemporary ====
Also in defense of the phrase, Stanford University historian Jack Rakove said that the founders were not referring to the equality of individuals but to the right to self-government enjoyed by all peoples. It was only later, in the decades following the Revolution, said Rakove, that the statement came to be interpreted in reference to personal liberties.

==Legacy==
The Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, written in 1945, uses the phrase &quot;all men are created equal&quot; and also mentions the U.S. Declaration of Independence in it.

The Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence, ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one, however, it omits the phrase &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, along with &quot;the consent of the governed&quot;.

The sentiment of the phrase, although not the exact wording, is echoed in numerous subsequent declarations of rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Germany&#x27;s Basic Laws, the Constitution of Algeria, and many other constitutions.

The phrase often serves as the first, or one of the first, rights listed in enumerations of rights, as a framing for all subsequent rights. Since Declarations of rights are often applied to all people, as natural human rights, the phrase emphasizes that all rights listed after it apply equally to every person.

<doc id="331174" wikidata="Q1173801" url="?curid=331174" title="David Bowie discography">
<text>During his lifetime, English singer-songwriter David Bowie (1947‚Äì2016) released 26 studio albums, nine live albums, two soundtrack albums, 26 compilation albums, eight extended plays, 128 singles and six box sets. Since his death, one further studio album, 13 live albums, one soundtrack album, one compilation album, four extended plays and six box sets have been released. Bowie also released 28 video albums and 72 music videos. Throughout his lifetime, Bowie sold at least 100 million records worldwide. In 2012, Bowie was ranked ninth best selling singles artist in United Kingdom with 10.6 million singles sold. As of January 2016, 12.09 million David Bowie singles had been sold in Britain. In a period of 24 months since his death, five million records were sold in UK, 3.1 million singles and two million albums.

Bowie&#x27;s debut release was the 1964 single &quot;Liza Jane&quot; by Davie Jones &amp; the King Bees. He released two more singles in 1965 under the names of the Manish Boys and Davy Jones, respectively. His first release using the name David Bowie was the 1966 single &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Thinking About Me&quot;, which was released with the Lower Third. His next single, &quot;Do Anything You Say&quot;, also released in 1966, was the first release by simply David Bowie. Bowie released four more singles and his debut album, &quot;David Bowie&quot;, but the first success in the United Kingdom was with the 1969 single &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. The single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart after it was released five days before the Apollo 11 Moon mission. In 1975, the single was re-released, becoming Bowie&#x27;s first UK number-one single. Bowie released three more albums¬†‚Äì &quot;David Bowie&quot; (1969), &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (1970), and &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (1971)¬†‚Äì before he eventually entered the UK Albums Chart with &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; (1972), which peaked at number five. Its success saw sales of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; improve and it eventually peaked at number three in the UK in 1973. RCA re-released the 1969&quot; David Bowie&quot; under the title &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, which reached numbers 17 and 26 in the UK, respectively.

Bowie released nine more studio albums with RCA, all of which reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart; &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, &quot;Pin Ups&quot; (both 1973), &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974) and &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; (1980) all reached number one. &quot;Young Americans&quot; included his first US number-one single &quot;Fame&quot;. He then released three solo studio albums with EMI¬†‚Äì &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983), whose title track became his first single to reach number one in both the UK and US, &quot;Tonight&quot; (1984) and &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (1987). &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot; reached number one in the UK, while &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; reached number six. The success of &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; revitalised Bowie&#x27;s back catalogue: throughout the summer of 1983, he had multiple albums on the UK Albums Chart. This peaked on 16 July that year, with ten entries ‚Äì a figure bettered only by Elvis Presley.

From 1988 to 1992, Bowie performed as a member of the rock band Tin Machine, who released two studio albums before disbanding. Continuing as a solo artist, &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; (1993) reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. Despite numerous label changes throughout the decade, Bowie had further UK top ten success into the 2000s, from &quot;Outside&quot; (1995) to &quot;Reality&quot; (2003). After a ten-year hiatus, Bowie returned with &quot;The Next Day&quot; (2013), his first UK number one since &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;. His final album, &quot;Blackstar&quot;, was released on 8 January 2016, his 69th birthday and two days before his death on 10 January. The album debuted at number one in the UK and became his first album to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US. Since 2015, Parlophone has remastered Bowie&#x27;s back catalogue through the &quot;Era&quot; box set series, starting with &quot;Five Years (1969‚Äì1973)&quot;.

<doc id="331193" wikidata="Q935996" url="?curid=331193" title="Fretilin">
<text>The Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (, abbreviated as Fretilin) is a centre-left political party in East Timor. It presently holds 19 of 65 seats in the National Parliament. Fretilin formed the government in East Timor until its independence in 2002. It obtained the presidency in 2017 under Francisco Guterres but lost in the 2022 East Timorese presidential election.

Fretilin began as a resistance movement that fought for the independence of East Timor, originally from Portugal in 1974, and later from Indonesia until 1999. After East Timor gained its independence in 2002, Fretilin became one of several parties competing for power in a multi-party system.

== History before independence==
=== Ascendancy and destruction ===
Fretilin was founded on 20 May 1974 as the Timorese Social Democratic Association (ASDT). The ASDT renamed itself to Fretilin on 11 September 1974 and took a more radical stance, proclaiming itself the ‚Äúsole legitimate representative‚Äù of the East Timorese people. In response to a coup by the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) on 11 August 1975, Fretilin hastily formed an armed wing called Falintil, which emerged victorious after a three week civil war. Falintil would continue to wage war against the Indonesian military during its invasion on 7 December 1975 and ensuing occupation.

Fretilin formally declared East Timor&#x27;s independence from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and inaugurated an 18-member cabinet with members of the Fretilin Central Committee with Xavier do Amaral as president and Nicolau dos Reis Lobato as both vice president and prime minister. The two men fell out as the pressures from the occupation escalated, and in September 1977 Lobato had do Amaral arrested for &quot;high treason&quot;. On 31 December 1978, Lobato, do Amaral&#x27;s successor as president, was killed by the Indonesian forces. He was succeeded by Mau Lear, who served until he was also tracked down and executed by Indonesian forces on 2 February 1979.

Fretilin came under enormous pressure in the late 1970s. From September 1977 to February 1979, only three of the 52 members of Fretilin&#x27;s Central Committee survived.

=== Recuperation and national unity===
Fretilin survived despite the military collapse, and was slowly rebuilt under the relatively moderate and nationalist leadership of Xanana Gusm√£o.

Between March 1981 and April 1984, Fretilin was known as &quot;Partido Marxista‚ÄìLeninista Fretilin&quot; (PMLF), and Marxism-Leninism was officially declared the party&#x27;s ideology. The name was changed back in 1984; furthermore, its revolutionary politics was abandoned in order to further national unity and acquire the support of the UDT and the Catholic Church.

== History since independence==
In the first elections, held in 2001, the year before independence, Fretilin polled 57.4% of the vote and took 55 seats in the 88-seat Assembly. While this gave the party a working majority, it fell short of the two-thirds majority it had hoped for to dictate the drafting of a national constitution.

In the June 2007 parliamentary election, Fretilin again took first place, but with a greatly reduced 29% of the vote and 21 seats. In the election, it faced a challenge from the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT), led by former president Xanana Gusm√£o, which placed second. Although Fretilin did not win a majority of seats, its Secretary-General, Mari Alkatiri, spoke of forming a minority government. The party formed a national unity government which included the CNRT, a collaboration that they had previously rejected.

However, subsequent talks between the parties were unsuccessful in reaching an agreement on a government. After weeks of dispute between the CNRT-led coalition and Fretilin over who should form the government, Jos√© Ramos-Horta announced on 6 August that the CNRT-led coalition would form the government and that Gusm√£o would become prime minister. Fretilin denounced Ramos Horta&#x27;s decision as unconstitutional, and angry Fretilin supporters in Dili immediately reacted to Ramos-Horta&#x27;s announcement with violent protests. Alkatiri said that the party would fight the decision through legal means and would encourage people to protest and practice civil disobedience. A few days later, Fretilin Vice-president Ars√©nio Bano said that the party would not challenge the government in court, and expressed a desire for a &quot;political solution&quot; leading to the creation of a national unity government.

Francisco Guterres of Fretilin served as president of East Timor from 2017 to 2022. Guterres sought re-election to a second term in 2022, but lost to Jos√© Ramos-Horta. The CNRT was in power from 2007 to 2017, but Fretilin Secretary-General Mari Alkatiri formed a coalition government after the July 2017 parliamentary election. However, his new minority government soon fell, resulting in a second general election in May 2018, which the CNRT won as part of the 2017‚Äì2020 coalition called the Alliance for Change and Progress (AMP).

<doc id="331195" wikidata="Q1425056" url="?curid=331195" title="Mass surveillance">
<text>Mass surveillance is the intricate surveillance of an entire or a substantial fraction of a population in order to monitor that group of citizens. The surveillance is often carried out by local and federal governments or governmental organizations, but it may also be carried out by corporations (either on behalf of governments or at their own initiative). Depending on each nation&#x27;s laws and judicial systems, the legality of and the permission required to engage in mass surveillance varies. It is the single most indicative distinguishing trait of totalitarian regimes. It is often distinguished from targeted surveillance.

Mass surveillance has often been cited as necessary to fight terrorism, prevent crime and social unrest, protect national security, and control the population. At the same time, mass surveillance has equally often been criticized for violating privacy rights, limiting civil and political rights and freedoms, and being illegal under some legal or constitutional systems. Another criticism is that increasing mass surveillance could potentially lead to the development of a surveillance state, an electronic police state, or a totalitarian state wherein civil liberties are infringed or political dissent is undermined by COINTELPRO-like programs.

In 2013, the practice of mass surveillance by world governments was called into question after Edward Snowden&#x27;s 2013 global surveillance disclosure on the practices by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. Reporting based on documents Snowden leaked to various media outlets triggered a debate about civil liberties and the right to privacy in the Digital Age. Mass surveillance is considered a global issue. The Aerospace Corporation of the United States describes a near-future event, the GEOINT Singularity, in which everything on Earth will be monitored at all times, analyzed by artificial intelligence systems, and then redistributed and made available to the general public globally in real time.

==By country==
Privacy International&#x27;s 2007 survey, covering 47 countries, indicated that there had been an increase in surveillance and a decline in the performance of privacy safeguards, compared to the previous year. Balancing these factors, eight countries were rated as being &#x27;endemic surveillance societies&#x27;. Of these eight, China, Malaysia and Russia scored lowest, followed jointly by Singapore and the United Kingdom, then jointly by Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. The best ranking was given to Greece, which was judged to have &#x27;adequate safeguards against abuse&#x27;.

Many countries throughout the world have already been adding thousands of surveillance cameras to their urban, suburban and even rural areas. For example, in September 2007 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stated that we are &quot;in danger of tipping into a genuine surveillance society completely alien to American values&quot; with &quot;the potential for a dark future where our every move, our every transaction, our every communication is recorded, compiled, and stored away, ready to be examined and used against us by the authorities whenever they want&quot;.

On 12 March 2013, Reporters Without Borders published a &quot;Special report on Internet Surveillance&quot;. The report included a list of &quot;State Enemies of the Internet&quot;, countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Five countries were placed on the initial list: Bahrain, China, Iran, Syria, and Vietnam.

===Australia===
===Bahrain===
Bahrain is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders&#x27; March 2013 list of &quot;State Enemies of the Internet&quot;, countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. The level of Internet filtering and surveillance in Bahrain is one of the highest in the world. The royal family is represented in all areas of Internet management and has sophisticated tools at its disposal for spying on its subjects. The online activities of dissidents and news providers are closely monitored and the surveillance is increasing.

Media reports published in July 2021 exposed the use of NSO Group&#x27;s phone malware software, Pegasus, for spying on rights activists, lawyers, and journalists, globally, by authoritarian governments. Bahrain was among the many countries listed as the Israeli firm&#x27;s clients accused of hacking and conducting unauthorized mass surveillance using phone malware despite a poor human rights record. The software is said to infect devices, allowing its operators to get access to the target&#x27;s messages, photos, record calls, and activate the microphone and camera.

Yusuf al-Jamri had no idea that even after fleeing Bahrain, he won&#x27;t be able to escape the government&#x27;s prying eyes, even after taking asylum in the UK. After moving to the UK and getting his asylum request accepted, Al-Jamri legally filed charges against Bahrain along with the notorious spyware firm, NSO Group for infecting his phone with a malware, built with military-grade technology in August 2019. The hacking was verified by the researchers at Toronto based CitizenLab. As a result of which Yusuf complained of being subjected to personal injury, loss of privacy, distress and anxiety. Al-Jamri&#x27;s lawyers made claims about the same in a pre-claim letter sent to both the accused, NSO Group and the Bahraini government. No response was received from the two on being approached for comments.

===Canada===
===China===
===East Germany===

Before the Digital Revolution, one of the world&#x27;s biggest mass surveillance operations was carried out by the Stasi, the secret police of the former East Germany. By the time the state collapsed in 1989, the Stasi had built up an estimated civilian network of 189,000 informants, who monitored even minute hints of political dissent among other citizens. Many West Germans visiting friends and family in East Germany were also subject to Stasi spying, as well as many high-ranking West German politicians and persons in the public eye.

Most East German citizens were well aware that their government was spying on them, which led to a culture of mistrust: touchy political issues were only discussed in the comfort of their own four walls and only with the closest of friends and family members, while widely maintaining a fa√ßade of unquestioning followership in public.

===European Union===
The right to privacy is a highly developed area of law in Europe. The Data Protection Directive used to regulate the processing of personal data within the European Union, before it was replaced by the GDPR. For comparison, the US has no data protection law that is comparable to this; instead, the US regulates data protection on a sectoral basis.

Since early 2012, the European Union has been working on a General Data Protection Regulation to replace the Data Protection Directive and harmonise data protection and privacy law. On 20 October 2013, a committee at the European Parliament backed the measure, which, if it is enacted, could require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of revelations about a far-reaching spying program by the U.S. National Security Agency. European Union justice and rights commissioner Viviane Reding said &quot;The question has arisen whether the large-scale collection and processing of personal information under US surveillance programmes is necessary and proportionate to meet the interests of national security.&quot; The EU is also asking the US for changes to US legislation to match the legal redress offered in Europe; American citizens in Europe can go to the courts if they feel their rights are infringed but Europeans without right of residence in America cannot. When the EU / US arrangement to implement International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles were struck down by the European Court of Justice, a new framework for transatlantic data flows, called the &quot;EU-US Privacy Shield&quot;, was adopted in July 2016.

In April 2014, the European Court of Justice declared invalid the EU Data Retention Directive. The Court said it violates two basic rights ‚Äì respect for private life and protection of personal data. The legislative body of the European Union passed the Data Retention Directive on 15 December 2005. It required that telecommunication operators retain metadata for telephone, Internet, and other telecommunication services for periods of not less than six months and not more than two years from the date of the communication as determined by each EU member state and, upon request, to make the data available to various governmental bodies. Access to this information is not limited to investigation of serious crimes, nor was a warrant required for access.Protection

Undertaken under the &quot;Seventh Framework Programme&quot; &quot;for research and technological development&quot; (FP7 - Science in Society) some multidisciplinary and mission oriented mass surveillance activities (for example INDECT and HIDE) were funded by the European Commission in association with industrial partners.
The INDECT Project (&quot;Intelligent information system supporting observation, searching and detection for security of citizens in urban environment&quot;) develops an intelligent urban environment observation system to register and exchange operational data for the automatic detection, recognition and intelligent processing of all information of abnormal behaviour or violence.

The main expected results of the INDECT project are:
* Trial of intelligent analysis of video and audio data for threat detection in urban environments,
* Creation of tools and technology for privacy and data protection during storage and transmission of information using quantum cryptography and new methods of digital watermarking,
* Performing computer-aided detection of threats and targeted crimes in Internet resources with privacy-protecting solutions,
* Construction of a search engine for rapid semantic search based on watermarking of content related to child pornography and human organ trafficking,
* Implementation of a distributed computer system that is capable of effective intelligent processing.

HIDE (&quot;Homeland Security, Biometric Identification &amp; Personal Detection Ethics&quot;) was a research project funded by the European Commission within the scope of the Seventh RTD Framework Programme (FP7). The consortium, coordinated by Emilio Mordini, explored the ethical and privacy implications of biometrics and personal detection technologies, focusing on the continuum between personal detection, authentication, identification and mass surveillance.

===Germany===
In 2002 German citizens were tipped off about wiretapping when a software error led to a phone number allocated to the German Secret Service being listed on mobile telephone bills.

===India===

The Indian parliament passed the Information Technology Act of 2008 with no debate, giving the government fiat power to tap all communications without a court order or a warrant. Section 69 of the act states &quot;Section 69 empowers the Central Government/State Government/ its authorized agency to intercept, monitor or decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource if it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence or for investigation of any offence.&quot;

India is setting up a national intelligence grid called NATGRID, which would be fully set up by May 2011 where each individual&#x27;s data ranging from land records, Internet logs, air and rail PNR, phone records, gun records, driving license, property records, insurance, and income tax records would be available in real time and with no oversight. With a UID from the Unique Identification Authority of India being given to every Indian from February 2011, the government would be able track people in real time. A national population registry of all citizens will be established by the 2011 census, during which fingerprints and iris scans would be taken along with GPS records of each household.

As per the initial plan, access to the combined data will be given to 11 agencies, including the Research and Analysis Wing, the Intelligence Bureau, the Enforcement Directorate, the National Investigation Agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and the Narcotics Control Bureau.

Several states within India have already installed CCTV surveillance systems with face matching capabilities using biometrics in Aadhaar. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are using information linked with Aadhaar across different agencies to create a 360-degree profile of a person, calling it the Integration Information Hub. Other states are now planning to follow this model.

===Iran===

Iran is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders&#x27; March 2013 list of &quot;State Enemies of the Internet&quot;, countries whose governments are involved in naturally active efforts to news providers . The government runs or controls almost all of the country&#x27;s institutions for regulating, managing or legislating on telecommunications. The Supreme Council for Cyberspace, which was headed by President Ahmadinejad, was established in March 2012 and now determines digital policy. The construction of a parallel &quot;Iranian Internet&quot;, with a high connection speed but fully monitored and censored, is almost complete.

The tools used by the Iranian authorities to monitor and control the Internet include data interception tools capable of deep packet inspection. Interception products from leading Chinese companies such as ZTE and Huawei are in use. The products provided by Huawei to Mobin Net, the leading national provider of mobile broadband, can be used to analyze email content, track browsing history and block access to sites. The products that ZTA sold to the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI) offer similar services plus the possibility of monitoring the mobile network. European companies are the source of other spying and data analysis tools. Products designed by Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks (later Trovicor) are in use. These companies sold SMS interception and user location products to Mobile Communication Company of Iran and Irancell, Iran&#x27;s two biggest mobile phone companies, in 2009 and they were used to identify Iranian citizens during the post-election uprising in 2009. The use of Israeli surveillance devices has also been detected in Iran. The network traffic management and surveillance device NetEnforcer was provided by Israel to Denmark and then resold to Iran. Similarly, US equipment has found its way to Iran via the Chinese company ZTE.

In September 2023 The Iranian government approved a law enabling it to have instant undeniable access every single thing in digital online life of citizens including location /photos, data and other vital record tied to people&#x27;s real identity, The persistent monitoring system is part of Iranian seventh quinquennial development program bill package.

===Malaysia===

In July 2018, the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Intercept Crimes Against Children Unit (icacu) that is equipped with real-time mass internet surveillance software developed in the United States and is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian internet users, with a focus on pornography and child pornography. The system creates a &quot;data library&quot; of users which includes details such as IP addresses, websites, locations, duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded.

===Mexico===
After struggling with drug trafficking and criminal groups for decades Mexico has been strengthening their military mass surveillance. Approximately half of the population in Mexico does not support democracy as a form of government, and believe an authoritarian system is better if social matters are solved through it. The relevance of these political beliefs may make it easier for mass surveillance to spread within the country. &quot;This does not necessarily mean the end of democratic institutions as a whole‚Äîsuch as free elections or the permanence of critical mass media‚Äîbut it means strengthening the mechanisms for exercising power that exclude dialogue, transparency and social agreement.&quot;

===Netherlands===
According to a 2003 report, the Netherlands has the second highest number of wiretaps per capita in the Western world. The Dutch military intelligence service MIVD operates a satellite ground station to intercept foreign satellite links and also a facility to eavesdrop on foreign high-frequency radio traffic.
An example of mass surveillance carried out by corporations in the Netherlands is an initiative started by five Dutch banks (ABN AMRO, ING, Rabobank, Triodos Bank and de Volksbank). In July 2020 these five banks have decided to establish Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL) in the collective fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The goal of TMNL-organization is to gather all transaction information provided by Dutch banks in a centralized database to enable full-scale collective transaction monitoring. Preparations have been started but the actual monitoring by TMNL can start after an amendment of the Dutch Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act.

===North Korea===

Having attained the nickname &#x27;surveillance state&#x27;, North Korea&#x27;s government has complete control over all forms of telecommunications and Internet. It is routine to be sent to a prison camp for communicating with the outside world. The government enforces restrictions around the types of appliances North Koreans may own in their home, in case radio or TV sets pick up signals from nearby South Korea, China and Russia. There is no attempt to mask the way this government actively spies on their citizens. In North Korea, an increasing number of citizens do have smartphones. However, these devices are heavily controlled and are being used to censor and observe everything North Koreans do on their phones. Reuters reported in 2015 that Koryolink, North Korea&#x27;s official mobile phone network, has around 3 million subscribers in a country of 24 million.

===Russia===
The SORM (and SORM-2) laws enable complete monitoring of any communication, electronic or traditional, by eight state agencies, without warrant. These laws seem to be in conflict with Article 23 of the Constitution of Russia which states:

# Everyone shall have the right to the inviolability of private life, personal and family secrets, the protection of honour and good name.
# Everyone shall have the right to privacy of correspondence, of telephone conversations, postal, telegraph and other messages. Limitations of this right shall be allowed only by court decision.
In 2015, the European Court for Human Rights ruled that the legislation violated Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (&quot;Zakharov v. Russia&quot;). 

–°AMERTON is a global vehicle tracking system, control and tracking, identification of probable routes and places of the most frequent appearance of a particular vehicle, integrated with a distributed network of radar complexes of photo-video fixation and road surveillance camera. Developed and implemented by the &quot;Advanced Scientific - Research Projects&quot; enterprise St. Petersburg. Within the framework of the practical use of the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, it has made it possible to identify and solve grave and especially grave crimes, the system is also operated by other state services and departments;

===Singapore===
Singapore is known as a city of sensors. Singapore&#x27;s surveillance structure spreads widely from closed-circuit television (CCTV) in public areas even around the neighbourhood, internet monitoring/traffic monitoring and to the use of surveillance metadata for government initiatives. In Singapore, SIM card registration is mandatory even for prepaid card. Singapore&#x27;s government have the rights to access communication data. Singapore&#x27;s largest telecompany, Singtel, has close relations to the government and Singapore&#x27;s laws are broadly phrased to allow the government to obtain sensitive data such as text-messages, email, call logs, and web surfing history from its people without the need for court permission.

The installation of mass surveillance cameras in Singapore is an effort to act as a deterrence not only for terror attacks but also for public security such as loan sharks, illegal parking, and more. As part of Singapore&#x27;s Smart Nation initiative to build a network of sensors to collect and connect data from city life (including the citizen&#x27;s movement), the Singapore government rolled out 1000 sensors ranging from computer chips to surveillance cameras, to track almost everything in Singapore from air quality to public safety in 2014.

In 2016, in a bid to increase security, the Singapore Police Force installed 62,000 police cameras in 10,000 Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks covering the lifts and multi-storey car parks. With rising security concerns, the number of CCTV cameras in public areas such as monitoring of the public transport system and commercial/ government buildings in Singapore is set to increase.

In 2018, the Singapore government rolled out new and more advanced surveillance systems. Starting with Singapore&#x27;s maritime borders, new panoramic electro-optic sensors were put in place on the north and south coasts, monitoring a 360-degree view of the area. A tethered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was unveiled by the Singapore Police Force to be used during search and rescue operations including hostage situations and public order incidents.

===Spain===
According to a 2017 report by Privacy International, Spain may be part of a group of 21 European countries that is withholding information, also known as data retention. In 2014, many defense lawyers tried to overturn multiple cases that used mass storage as their evidence to convict, according to the European Agency for Fundamental Rights.

===Sweden===
Prior to 2009, the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) was limited to wireless signals intelligence (SIGINT), although it was left largely unregulated. In December 2009, new legislation went into effect, allowing the FRA to monitor cable bound signals passing the Swedish border. Communications service providers are legally required, under confidentiality, to transfer cable communications crossing Swedish borders to specific &quot;interaction points&quot;, where data may be accessed after a court order.

The FRA has been contested since the change in its legislation, mainly because of the public perception the change would enable mass surveillance. The FRA categorically deny this allegation, as they are not allowed to initialize any surveillance on their own, and has no direct access to communication lines. All SIGINT has to be authorized by a special court and meet a set of narrow requirements, something Minister for Defence Sten Tolgfors have been quoted as saying, &quot;should render the debate on mass surveillance invalid&quot;. Due to the architecture of Internet backbones in the Nordic area, a large portion of Norwegian and Finnish traffic will also be affected by the Swedish wiretapping.

===Syria===
Ba&#x27;athist government of Syria has been ruling the country as a totalitarian surveillance state, policing every aspect of Syrian society for decades. Commanders of government&#x27;s security forces ‚Äì consisting of Syrian Arab Army, secret police, Ba&#x27;athist paramilitaries ‚Äì directly implement the executive functions of the Syrian state, with scant regard for legal processes and bureaucracy. Security services shut down civil society organizations, curtail freedom of movement within the country and bans non-Ba&#x27;athist political literature and symbols. During the Ba&#x27;athist rule, militarization of the Syrian society intensified. The number of personnel in the Syrian military and various intelligence entities expanded drastically from 65,000 in 1965 to 530,000 in 1991; and surpassed 700,000 in 2004.

Ba&#x27;athist secret police consists of four wings: general intelligence and the political security directorates, which are supervised by the Syrian Ministry of Interior; military intelligence and the air force intelligence directorates, which are supervised by the Syrian Ministry of Defence. The four directorates are directly controlled by the National Security Bureau of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party, and heads of the four branches report directly to the Syrian president, who is also the secretary general of the Ba&#x27;ath party. The surveillance system of the &quot;Mukhabarat&quot; is pervasive, and over 65,000 full-time officers were estimated to be working in its various branches during the 2000s. In addition, there are hundreds of thousands of part-time employees and informers in various Syrian intelligence departments. According to estimates, there is one member of various branches of the Ba&#x27;athist secret police for every 158 citizens, which is one of the largest ratios in the world.

The general intelligence, political security, and military intelligence divisions of the Ba&#x27;athist secret police have several branches in all governorates controlled by the Assad regime, with headquarters in Damascus. With state impunity granted by the Assad government, &quot;Mukhabarat&quot; officers wield pervasive influence over local bodies, civil associations, and bureaucracy, playing a major role in shaping Ba&#x27;athist administrative decisions. Additionally, intense factional rivalries and power struggles exist among various branches of the secret police. Several academics have described the military, bureaucratic, and secret police apparatus of the Ba&#x27;athist state as constituting a pyramidal socio-political structure with an Orwellian surveillance system designed to neutralize independent civic activities and political dissent from its very onset.

Syria is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders&#x27; March 2013 list of &quot;State Enemies of the Internet&quot;, countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Syria has stepped up its web censorship and cyber-monitoring as the country&#x27;s civil war has intensified. At least 13 Blue Coat proxy servers are in use, Skype calls are intercepted, and social engineering techniques, phishing, and malware attacks are all in use.

===United Arab Emirates===
In October 2016, &quot;The Intercept&quot; released a report detailing the experience of an Italian security researcher Simone Margaritelli, of allegedly being hired for mass surveillance operations run by United Arab Emirates. According to Margaritelli, he was called for an interview with the Abu Dhabi-based cybersecurity firm called DarkMatter. Margaritelli says he declined the offer and instead wrote a blog post titled &quot;How the United Arab Emirates Intelligence Tried to Hire Me to Spy on Its People&quot;. In response to The Intercept inquiries, DarkMatter responded by stating: &quot;No one from DarkMatter or its subsidiaries have ever interviewed Mr. Margaritelli.&quot; Kevin Healy, director of communications for DarkMatter, wrote in an email responding to The Intercept that the man Margaritelli says interviewed him was previously only an advisory consultant to DarkMatter and is currently no longer an advisor to the company. Dark Matter responded by saying &quot;While we respect an author&#x27;s right to express a personal opinion, we do not view the content in question as credible, and therefore have no further comment.&quot;

In January 2019, Reuters released a detailed account of a 2014 state-surveillance operation ‚Äì dubbed as Project Raven ‚Äì led by the United Arab Emirates with the help of former NSA officials like Lori Stroud, an ex-NSA cyberspy. Counter-terrorism strategy was the primary motive of setting up the unit. However, soon the project began being used as a surveillance program to spy on rival leaders, critical dissidents and journalists.

In December 2019, Google Play Store and Apple App Store removed an Emirati messaging application called ToTok following allegations that it was a state surveillance application, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; report. The application&#x27;s privacy policy clearly stated that it may share personal data of the users with &quot;regulatory agencies, law enforcement, and other lawful access requests&quot;. The allegations were denied by the co-founders of ToTok, Giacomo Ziani and Long Ruan, respectively. The application was restored on Google Play Store later on.

In July 2020, the United Arab Emirates came under renewed questions about mass surveillance amidst the coronavirus outbreak. Experts highlighted that the country has one of the highest per capita concentrations of surveillance cameras in the world. In a statement, the Emirati government acknowledged that cameras are used to counter the threat of terrorism and have helped the country rank as one of the safest countries in the world.

===United Kingdom===
State surveillance in the United Kingdom has formed part of the public consciousness since the 19th century. The postal espionage crisis of 1844 sparked the first panic over the privacy of citizens. However, in the 20th century, electronic surveillance capabilities grew out of wartime signal intelligence and pioneering code breaking. In 1946, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was formed. The United Kingdom and the United States signed the bilateral UKUSA Agreement in 1948. It was later broadened to include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as cooperation with several &quot;third-party&quot; nations. This became the cornerstone of Western intelligence gathering and the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; between the UK and the US.

After the growth of the Internet and development of the World Wide Web, a series of media reports in 2013 revealed more recent programs and techniques involving GCHQ, such as Tempora.

The use of these capabilities is controlled by laws made in the UK Parliament. In particular, access to the content of private messages (that is, interception of a communication) must be authorized by a warrant signed by a Secretary of State. In addition European Union data privacy law applies in UK law. The UK exhibits governance and safeguards as well as use of electronic surveillance.

The Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a judicial oversight body for the intelligence agencies, ruled in December 2014 that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not breach the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the Tribunal stated in February 2015 that one particular aspect, the data sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance programs Prism and Upstream, had been in contravention of human rights law prior to this until two paragraphs of additional information, providing details about the procedures and safeguards, were disclosed to the public in December 2014.

In its December 2014 ruling, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal found that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance. A report on Privacy and Security published by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament also came to this view, although it found past shortcomings in oversight and said the legal framework should be simplified to improve transparency. This view is supported by independent reports from the Interception of Communications Commissioner. However, notable civil liberties groups continue to express strong views to the contrary and plan to appeal the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights, while others have criticised these viewpoints in turn.

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIP or RIPA) is a significant piece of legislation that granted and regulated the powers of public bodies to carry out surveillance and investigation. In 2002 the UK government announced plans to extend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act so that at least 28 government departments would be given powers to access metadata about citizens&#x27; web, e-mail, telephone and fax records, without a warrant and without a subject&#x27;s knowledge.

The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 includes several provisions related to controlling and restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information in government databases.

Supported by all three major political parties, the UK Parliament passed the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act in July 2014 to ensure police and security services retain existing powers to access phone and Internet records.

This was superseded by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, a comprehensive statute which made public a number of previously secret powers (equipment interference, bulk retention of metadata, intelligence agency use of bulk personal datasets), and enables the Government to require internet service providers and mobile phone companies to maintain records of (but not the content of) customers&#x27; Internet connections for 12 months. In addition, it created new safeguards, including a requirement for judges to approve the warrants authorised by a Secretary of State before they come into force. The Act was informed by two reports by David Anderson QC, the UK&#x27;s Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation: A Question of Trust (2015) and the report of his Bulk Powers Review (2016), which contains a detailed appraisal (with 60 case studies) of the operational case for the powers often characterised as mass surveillance. It may yet require amendment as a consequence of legal cases brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights.

Many advanced nation-states have implemented laws that partially protect citizens from unwarranted intrusion, such as the Human Rights Act 1998, the Data Protection Act 1998, (updated as the Data Protection Act 2018, to include the General Data Protection Regulation), and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 in the United Kingdom, and laws that require a formal warrant before private data may be gathered by a government.

The vast majority of video surveillance cameras in the UK are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 Freedom of Information Act requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK. The prevalence of video surveillance in the UK is often overstated due to unreliable estimates being requoted; for example one report in 2002 extrapolated from a very small sample to estimate the number of cameras in the UK at 4.2 million (of which 500,000 in London). More reliable estimates put the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom at around 1.85 million in 2011.

===United States===

Historically, mass surveillance was used as part of wartime censorship to control communications that could damage the war effort and aid the enemy. For example, during the world wars, every international telegram from or to the United States sent through companies such as Western Union was reviewed by the US military. After the wars were over, surveillance continued in programs such as the Black Chamber following World War I and project Shamrock following World War II. COINTELPRO projects conducted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) between 1956 and 1971 targeted various &quot;subversive&quot; organizations, including peaceful anti-war and racial equality activists such as Albert Einstein and Martin Luther King Jr.

Billions of dollars per year are spent, by agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as Carnivore, ECHELON, and NarusInsight to intercept and analyze the immense amount of data that traverses the Internet and telephone system every day.

Under the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program, the U.S. Postal Service photographs the exterior of every piece of paper mail that is processed in the United States ‚Äì about 160 billion pieces in 2012. The U.S. Postmaster General stated that the system is primarily used for mail sorting, but the images are available for possible use by law enforcement agencies. Created in 2001 following the anthrax attacks that killed five people, it is a sweeping expansion of a 100-year-old program called &quot;mail cover&quot; which targets people suspected of crimes.

The FBI developed the computer programs &quot;Magic Lantern&quot; and CIPAV, which they can remotely install on a computer system, in order to monitor a person&#x27;s computer activity.

The NSA has been gathering information on financial records, Internet surfing habits, and monitoring e-mails. They have also performed extensive analysis of social networks such as Myspace.

The PRISM special source operation system legally immunized private companies that cooperate voluntarily with U.S. intelligence collection. According to &quot;The Register&quot;, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 &quot;specifically authorizes intelligence agencies to monitor the phone, email, and other communications of U.S. citizens for up to a week without obtaining a warrant&quot; when one of the parties is outside the U.S. PRISM was first publicly revealed on 6 June 2013, after classified documents about the program were leaked to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; by American Edward Snowden.

The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires that all U.S. telecommunications and Internet service providers modify their networks to allow easy wiretapping of telephone, VoIP, and broadband Internet traffic.

In early 2006, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that several major telephone companies were providing the telephone call records of U.S. citizens to the National Security Agency (NSA), which is storing them in a large database known as the NSA call database. This report came on the heels of allegations that the U.S. government had been conducting electronic surveillance of domestic telephone calls without warrants. In 2013, the existence of the Hemisphere Project, through which AT&amp;T provides telephone call data to federal agencies, became publicly known.

Traffic cameras, which were meant to help enforce traffic laws at intersections, may be used by law enforcement agencies for purposes unrelated to traffic violations. Some cameras allow for the identification of individuals inside a vehicle and license plate data to be collected and time stamped for cross reference with other data used by police. The Department of Homeland Security is funding networks of surveillance cameras in cities and towns as part of its efforts to combat terrorism.

The New York City Police Department infiltrated and compiled dossiers on protest groups before the 2004 Republican National Convention, leading to over 1,800 arrests.

Modern surveillance in the United States was thought of more of a wartime effort before Snowden disclosed in depth information about the National Security Agency in June 2013. The constant development and improvements of the Internet and technology has made it easier for mass surveillance to take hold. Such revelations allow critical commentators to raise questions and scrutinize the implementation, use, and abuse of networking technologies, devices, and software systems that partake in a &quot;global surveillant assemblage&quot; (Bogard 2006; Collier and Ong 2004; Haggerty and Ericson 2000; Murakami Wood 2013). The NSA collected millions of Verizon user&#x27;s telephone records in between 2013 and 2014. The NSA also collected data through Google and Facebook with a program called &#x27;Prism&#x27;. Journalists through Snowden published nearly 7,000 top-secret documents since then, yet the information disclosed is less than 1% of the entire information.

===Vietnam===
Vietnam is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders&#x27; March 2013 list of &quot;State Enemies of the Internet&quot;, countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Most of the country&#x27;s 16 service providers are directly or indirectly controlled by the Vietnamese Communist Party. The industry leader, Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group, which controls 74 per cent of the market, is state-owned. So is Viettel, an enterprise of the Vietnamese armed forces. FPT Telecom is a private firm, but is accountable to the Party and depends on the market leaders for bandwidth.

Service providers are the major instruments of control and surveillance. Bloggers monitored by the government frequently undergo man-in-the-middle attacks. These are designed to intercept data meant to be sent to secure (https) sites, allowing passwords and other communication to be intercepted. According to a July 2012 Freedom House report, 91 percent of survey respondents connected to the Internet on their mobile devices believe that the government monitors conversations and tracks the calls of &quot;activists&quot; or &quot;reactionaries&quot;. In 2018, the Vietnam National Assembly also passed a cybersecurity law closely resembling one passed in China, requiring localisation of user data and censorship of anti-state content.

==Commercial mass surveillance==

As a result of the digital revolution, many aspects of life are now captured and stored in digital form. Concern has been expressed that governments may use this information to conduct mass surveillance on their populations. Commercial mass surveillance often makes use of copyright laws and &quot;user agreements&quot; to obtain (typically uninformed) &#x27;consent&#x27; to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials. This allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed by government agencies. This data is then often shared with government agencies, thereby, in practice, defeating the purpose of such privacy protections.

One of the most common forms of mass surveillance is carried out by commercial organizations. Many people are willing to join supermarket and grocery loyalty card programs, trading their personal information and surveillance of their shopping habits in exchange for a discount on their groceries, although base prices might be increased to encourage participation in the program.

Through programs like Google&#x27;s AdSense, OpenSocial and their increasing pool of so-called &quot;web gadgets&quot;, &quot;social gadgets&quot;, and other Google-hosted services many web sites on the Internet are effectively feeding user information about sites visited by the users, and now also their social connections, to Google. Facebook also keep this information, although its acquisition is limited to page views within Facebook. This data is valuable for authorities, advertisers and others interested in profiling users, trends and web site marketing performance. Google, Facebook and others are increasingly becoming more guarded about this data as their reach increases and the data becomes more all inclusive, making it more valuable.

New features like geolocation give an even increased admission of monitoring capabilities to large service providers like Google, where they also are enabled to track one&#x27;s physical movements while users are using mobile devices, especially those which are syncing without any user interaction. Google&#x27;s Gmail service is increasingly employing features to work as a stand-alone application which also might activate while a web browser is not even active for synchronizing; a feature mentioned on the Google I/O 2009 developer conference while showing the upcoming HTML5 features which Google and others are actively defining and promoting.

In 2008 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Google CEO Eric Schmidt, said: &quot;The arrival of a truly mobile Web, offering a new generation of location-based advertising, is set to unleash a &#x27;huge revolution&#x27;&quot;. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on 16 February 2010, Google presented their vision of a new business model for mobile operators and trying to convince mobile operators to embrace location-based services and advertising. With Google as the advertising provider, it would mean that every mobile operator using their location-based advertising service would be revealing the location of their mobile customers to Google.

Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation are constantly informing users on the importance of privacy, and considerations about technologies like geolocation.

Computer company Microsoft patented in 2011 a product distribution system with a camera or capture device that monitors the viewers that consume the product, allowing the provider to take &quot;remedial action&quot; if the actual viewers do not match the distribution license.

Reporters Without Borders&#x27; March 2013 &quot;Special report on Internet Surveillance&quot; contained a list of &quot;Corporate Enemies of the Internet&quot;, companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. The five companies on the initial list were: Amesys (France), Blue Coat Systems (U.S.), Gamma Group (UK and Germany), Hacking Team (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany), but the list was not exhaustive and is likely to be expanded in the future.

EFF found that a company by the name of Fog Data Science purchases location data from apps and sells it to the law enforcement agencies in the U.S. without requiring a warrant or a court order.

==Surveillance state==
A surveillance state is a country where the government engages in pervasive surveillance of large numbers of its citizens and visitors. Such widespread surveillance is usually justified as being necessary for national security, such as to prevent crime or acts of terrorism, but may also be used to stifle criticism of and opposition to the government.
Examples of early surveillance states include the former Soviet Union and the former East Germany, which had a large network of informers and an advanced technology base in computing and spy-camera technology. However, these states did not have today&#x27;s technologies for mass surveillance, such as the use of databases and pattern recognition software to cross-correlate information obtained by wire tapping, including speech recognition and telecommunications traffic analysis, monitoring of financial transactions, automatic number plate recognition, the tracking of the position of mobile telephones, and facial recognition systems and the like which recognize people by their appearance, gait, DNA profiling, etc.

===Smart cities===
The development of smart cities has seen the increased adoption of surveillance technologies by governments, although the primary purpose of surveillance in such cities is to use information and communication technologies to control the urban environment. The implementation of such technology by a number of cities has resulted in increased efficiencies in urban infrastructure as well as improved community participation. Sensors and systems monitor a smart city&#x27;s infrastructure, operations and activities and aim to help it run more efficiently. For example, the city could use less electricity; its traffic run more smoothly with fewer delays; its citizens use the city with more safety; hazards can be dealt with faster; citizen infractions of rules can be prevented, and the city&#x27;s infrastructure; power distribution and roads with traffic lights for example, dynamically adjusted to respond to differing circumstances.

The development of smart city technology has also led to an increase in potential unwarranted intrusions into privacy and restrictions upon autonomy. The widespread incorporation of information and communication technologies within the daily life of urban residents results in increases in the surveillance capacity of states ‚Äì to the extent that individuals may be unaware of what information is being accessed, when the access occurs and for what purpose. It is possible that such conditions could give rise to the development of an electronic police state. Shanghai, Amsterdam, San Jose, Dubai, Barcelona, Madrid, Stockholm, and New York are all cities that use various techniques from smart city technology.

===Electronic police state===


An electronic police state is a state in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, collect, store, organize, analyze, search, and distribute information about its citizens. The first use of the term &quot;electronic police state&quot; was likely in a posting by Jim Davis. Electronic police states also engage in mass government surveillance of landline and cellular telephone traffic, mail, email, web surfing, Internet searches, radio, and other forms of electronic communication as well as widespread use of video surveillance. The information is usually collected in secret.

The crucial elements are not politically based, so long as the government can afford the technology and the populace will permit it to be used, an electronic police state can form. The continual use of electronic mass surveillance can result in constant low-level fear within the population, which can lead to self-censorship and exerts a powerful coercive force upon the populace.

==In popular culture==
The concept of being monitored by our governments collects a large audience of curious citizens. Mass surveillance has been prominently featured in a wide array of books, films, and other media. Advances in technology over the last century have led to possible social control through the Internet and the conditions of late capitalism. Many directors and writers have been enthralled with the potential stories that could come from mass surveillance. Perhaps the most iconic example of fictional mass surveillance is George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, which depicts a dystopian surveillance state.

Here are a few other works that focus on mass surveillance:
* &quot;We&quot;, a 1920 novel by Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin, that predates &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and was read by its author George Orwell.
* &quot;Little Brother&quot; is a novel by Cory Doctorow, and is set in San Francisco after a major terrorist attack. The DHS uses technologies such as RFIDs and surveillance cameras to create a totalitarian system of control.
* &quot;The Lives of Others&quot;, is a 2006 German drama film, which conveys the impact that relentless surveillance has on the emotional well-being and the outcome of individuals subjected to it.
* &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; by Suzanne Collins is a trilogy in which &#x27;the Capitol&#x27; has totalitarian surveillance and control over all aspects of the other &#x27;districts&#x27;.
* &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;, novel by Dan Brown, involving an NSA code breaking machine called &#x27;TRANSLTR&#x27;. The machine read and decrypted email messages, with which the NSA used to foil terrorist attacks and mass murders.
*Valve&#x27;s 2004 video game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; is set in City 17, a fictional police state in Eastern Europe in which citizens are under constant surveillance.
* The Ubisoft video game series &quot;Watch Dogs&quot; is set in the near future with AI connected cities that use surveillance systems to monitor their people in increasingly invasive ways. In particular, &quot;Watch Dogs: Legion&quot; is set in a dystopian London where an oppressive regime has taken power and incorporates heavy use of surveillance software to control the populace following a series of terrorist attacks.

<text>The cassock, also called soutane, is a Christian clerical coat used by the clergy and male religious of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church, in addition to some clergy in certain Protestant denominations such as Anglicans and Lutherans. &quot;Ankle-length garment&quot; is the literal meaning of the corresponding Latin term, . It is related to the habits traditionally worn by nuns, monks, and friars.

The cassock derives historically from the tunic of classical antiquity that in ancient Rome was worn underneath the toga, and the chiton that was worn beneath the himation in ancient Greece. In religious services, it has traditionally been worn underneath vestments, such as the alb.

In the West, the cassock is little used today except for religious services, save for traditionalist and those other Catholic clergy and religious who continue to wear the cassock as their standard attire. However, in many countries it was the normal everyday wear of the clergy until the 1960s, when it was largely replaced by clerical suits, distinguished from lay dress by being generally black and by a black shirt incorporating a clerical collar.

In Japan, male &quot;gakuran&quot; school uniform were inspired by cassocks.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;cassock&quot; comes from Middle French , meaning a long coat. In turn, the Old French word may come ultimately from Turkish (nomad, adventurer¬†‚Äì the source of the word &quot;Cossack&quot;), an allusion to their typical riding coat, or from Persian (padded garment) ‚Äì (raw silk) + (stuffed). The name was originally specially applied to the dress worn by soldiers and horsemen, and later to the long garment worn in civil life by both men and women. As an ecclesiastical term, the word &quot;cassock&quot; came into use somewhat late (as a translation of the old names of &quot;subtanea&quot;, &quot;vestis talaris&quot;, &quot;toga talaris&quot;, or &quot;tunica talaris&quot;), being mentioned in Canon LXXIV (74) of the Anglican &quot;1604 Canons&quot;; and it is in this sense alone that it now survives.

The word &quot;&quot; is a French word, coming from Latin , the adjectival form of (beneath).

== Western Christian practice ==

=== Latin Catholic ===

The cassock (or soutane) comes in a number of styles or cuts, though no particular symbolism attaches to these. A Roman cassock often has a series of buttons down the front. In some English-speaking countries these buttons may be merely ornamental, with a concealed fly-front buttoning, known as a Chesterfield front, used to fasten the garment. A French cassock also has buttons sewn to the sleeves after the manner of a suit, and a slightly broader skirt. An Ambrosian cassock has a series of only five buttons under the neck, with a sash on the waist. A Jesuit cassock, in lieu of buttons, has a fly fastened with hooks at the collar and is bound at the waist with a cincture knotted on the right side.

The ordinary Roman cassock worn by Roman Catholic clerics (as distinct from that worn as choir dress) is black except in tropical countries, where because of the heat it is white and usually without shoulder cape (pellegrina). Coloured piping and buttons are added in accordance with rank: black for priests, purple for chaplains of His Holiness; amaranth red for bishops, protonotaries apostolic and Honorary Prelates; and scarlet red for cardinals.

The 1969 Instruction on the dress of prelates stated that for all of them, even cardinals, the dress for ordinary use may be a simple black cassock without coloured trim.

A band cincture or sash, known also as a fascia, may be worn with the cassock. The Instruction on the dress of prelates specifies that the two ends that hang down by the side have silk fringes, abolishing the sash with tassels. A black faille fascia is worn by priests, deacons, and major seminarians, while a purple faille fascia is used by bishops, protonotaries apostolic, honorary prelates, and chaplains of His Holiness, when wearing a cassock with coloured trim. A black watered-silk fascia is permitted for priests attached to the papal household, a purple watered-silk fascia for bishops attached to the papal household (for example, Apostolic Nuncios), and a scarlet watered-silk fascia for cardinals. The Pope wears a white watered-silk fascia, sometimes with his coat of arms on the ends.

In choir dress, chaplains of His Holiness wear their purple-trimmed black cassocks with a cotta, but bishops, protonotaries apostolic, and honorary prelates use (with a cotta or, in the case of bishops, a rochet and mozzetta) cassocks that are fully purple (this purple corresponds more closely with a Roman purple and is approximated as fuchsia) with scarlet trim, while those of cardinals are fully scarlet with scarlet trim. Cardinals have the additional distinction of having both choir cassock sleeves and the fascia made of scarlet watered-silk. The &quot;cut&quot; of the choir cassock is still a Roman-cut or French-cut Roman cassock.

In the past, a cardinal&#x27;s cassock was made entirely of watered silk, with a train that could be fastened at the back of the cassock. This train was abolished by the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Valde solliciti&quot; of Pope Pius XII with effect from 1 January 1953. With the same &quot;motu proprio&quot;, the Pope ordered that the violet cassock (then used in penitential periods and in mourning) be made of wool, not silk, and in February 1965, under Pope Paul VI, a circular of the Sacred Ceremonial Congregation abolished the use of watered silk also for the red cassock.

An elbow-length shoulder cape, open in front, is sometimes worn with the cassock, either fixed to it or detachable. It is known as a pellegrina. It is distinct from the mozzetta, which is buttoned in front and is worn over a rochet.

The general rule of the Roman Catholic Church is that the pellegrina may be worn with the cassock by cardinals and bishops. In 1850, the year in which he restored the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, Pope Pius IX was understood to grant to all priests there the privilege of wearing a replica in black of his own white caped cassock. Since then, the wearing of the pellegrina with the cassock has been a sign of a Roman Catholic priest in England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, although sometimes imitated by Anglican priests.

In his 1909 book, &quot;Costume of Prelates of the Catholic Church&quot;, John Abel Felix Prosper Nainfa proposed the use of the English word &quot;simar&quot;, instead of the word &quot;cassock&quot;, for the garment with shoulder cape, which he treated as distinct from the cassock proper. Others too have made the same distinction between the &quot;simar&quot; (with pellegrina) and the &quot;cassock&quot; (without), but many scholars disagree with Nainfa&#x27;s distinction. More particularly, documents of the Holy See make no such distinction, using the term &quot;cassock&quot; or &quot;vestis talaris&quot; whether a pellegrina is attached or is not. Thus the 1969 instruction states that, for cardinals and bishops, &quot;the elbow-length cape, trimmed in the same manner as this &quot;cassock&quot;, may be worn over it&quot;. &quot;Cassock&quot;, rather than &quot;simar&quot;, is the term that is usually applied to the dress of Popes and other Catholic ecclesiastics. The instruction also gives no support to Nainfa&#x27;s claim that the cassock with shoulder cape should not be worn in church services, which moreover would be of difficult application, since the cassock with pellegrina is generally made as a single garment, with a non-detachable pellegrina.

Nainfa wrote that at that time the garment with shoulder cape was in Italian called a &quot;zimarra&quot;, a term, however, that in that language is today used rather of a historical loose-fitting overgown, quite unlike the close-fitting cassock with pellegrina worn by Catholic clergy, and similar to the fur-lined that was used in northern Europe. Images of the historical zimarra as worn by women can be seen at &quot;Dressing the Italian Way&quot; and &quot;The Italian Showcase&quot;.

In cold weather, the manto, an ankle-length cape with or without shoulder cape, or the greca, also known as the douillette, an ankle-length double-breasted overcoat, is traditionally worn over the cassock. For bishops and priests both the manto and greca are solid black in colour, while for the pope the manto is red and the greca is white.

=== Anglican and Methodist ===

The Anglican church uses single and double-breasted cassocks. For many this is to indicate tradition (single-breasted in the Anglo-Catholic tradition and double-breasted in the evangelical end of the church).

The double-breasted cassock fastens at the shoulders on the opposing side of the breast and at the waist with one concealed button. The latter usually has a single small stem-button sewn at centre front about below the centre-front neck line which is used to secure the academic hood, worn for Choir Dress.

The single-breasted cassock worn by Anglicans traditionally has thirty-nine buttons as signifying the &quot;Thirty-Nine Articles,&quot; or as some would prefer &quot;Forty stripes save one&quot; ‚Äì the punishment Saint Paul the Apostle says he received from the Jews.

Cassocks are often worn without a cincture and some opt for a buckled belt.

Black is the most common colour for priests (presbyters), readers, vergers, and server cassocks. Lighter colours, such as white are used in tropical countries and some cathedrals have colours specific for their location. Piping is also used in the Anglican church to indicate position held with red being used for Deans, Archdeacons and Cathedral Canons. Bishops and Archbishops often wear purple cassocks. This has been practise since the 19th century. More recently the Archbishops have chosen to wear black, this can be seen in the ministries of Rowan Williams and Justin Welby. A comparatively recent custom ‚Äì since the reign of Edward VII ‚Äì is that scarlet cassocks are properly worn only by Chaplains to the King and by members of Royal foundations such as Westminster Abbey and some Cambridge college chapels. They are also worn by the Head Master and Master of the King&#x27;s Scholars of Westminster School. Nonetheless, many cathedral canons wear full crimson cassocks rather than with mere piping, as do many servers guilds and choirs due to longstanding practice.
Cassocks are sometimes also worn by readers, altar servers, and choir members, when they do this is the double-breasted style. Readers and altar servers usually wear black cassocks, but those worn by choirs are usually coloured.

Ministers (presbyters) of the Methodist Church of Great Britain also traditionally wear a double-breasted cassock (as in the evangelical Anglican tradition).

=== Lutheran ===

In the Evangelical Lutheran Churches of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and the North German Hanseatic cities of Hamburg and L√ºbeck, clergy wear the cassock with the ruff as vestments.

The Cassock is also worn occasionally in American Lutheran churches. In previous years, the cassock was worn in combination with a white surplice which almost entirely covered it. It is customary for a minority of clergy to wear it on special high holidays such as Good Friday and Ash Wednesday. Most commonly, Lutheran pastors wear an alb over a clerical shirt (with clergy collar). Vestments, most commonly a stole, are worn over the alb.

=== Presbyterian ===

In the Church of Scotland, and Presbyterian churches which trace their heritage back to the Scottish church, they typically use the Anglican style of cassock. In addition, it is not uncommon to see full-length cassocks worn in the blue of the Flag of Scotland, which is also tied to the academic dress of the University of St Andrews. As is the custom within the Church of England, ministers of the Church of Scotland who are chaplains to the royal family also wear a scarlet cassock. Over this is typically worn a preaching gown or the academic gown of the minister. During the Edwardian and Victorian era, it was common to see a shortened, double-breasted black silk cassock worn under the gown. It generally reached to the knees and was tied with a simple cincture. However, with the liturgical movement of the 20th century, the classic cassock came back into fashion.

Presbyterians in Canada tend to follow the custom of the Church of Scotland, whereas Presbyterians in the United States typically wear an American Geneva gown over a sleeveless cassock or a non-cuffed gown over an Anglican or Roman style cassock. The American Geneva gown is often supplied with a cuff sewn into the double-bell sleeve (this innovation is a remnant of the cassock sleeve that was formerly worn underneath).

As is the practice in the Anglican churches, cassocks may be worn by others who are not ministers. Ordained elders and deacons, as they serve as worship leaders, readers, and administer communion may also wear cassocks which tend to be black. Those worn by choirs and other worship leaders are usually coloured (for instance, The Shadyside Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) choir is dressed in red cassocks under white surplices).

== Eastern Christian practice ==



In Eastern Christianity there are two types of cassock: the Inner Cassock and the Outer Cassock or Rason. Monastics always wear a black cassock. There is no rule about colouration for non-monastic clergy, but black is the most common. Blue or grey are also seen frequently, while white is sometimes worn for Pascha. In the Eastern Churches, cassocks are not dress for any lay ministry. Generally, one has to be blessed to wear a cassock usually in the case of exercising a clerical duty.

=== Types of Eastern cassocks ===
* The inner cassock (more often simply &quot;cassock&quot;) is an ankle length garment worn by all major and minor clergy, monastics, and often by male seminarians. The Slavic, or &quot;Russian&quot; style ( , ) is double-breasted, closely fitted through the torso and flaring out to the skirt, with a high collar buttoned off-center, and may be cinctured with either a leather or wide cloth belt. The Greek version, called an &quot;anteri&quot; (Œ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÅŒØ), &quot;rason&quot; (œÅŒ¨œÉŒøŒΩ), or &quot;zostiko&quot; (Œ∂œâœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå) is somewhat fuller, gathered at the waist with a narrow cloth belt, and with a high collar buttoned in the front. The inner cassock is usually worn by all clergy members under their liturgical vestments.
* The outer cassock ( , , ) is a voluminous garment worn over the inner cassock by bishops, priests, deacons, and monastics as their regular outerwear. It is not worn by seminarians, readers or subdeacons in the Russian tradition. In the Greek tradition, however, chanters may wear it in church, usually with no inner cassock beneath but directly over secular clothing. The outer cassock should be worn by a priest celebrating a service such as Vespers where the rubrics call for him to be less than fully vested, but it is not worn by any clergy beneath the sticharion. It may be worn with the bottoms of the sleeves turned back, which are sometimes faced in a contrasting colour. The Greek version tends to be somewhat lighter weight and more fully cut than the Russian. It is originally a monastic garment, and in the Russian tradition a man must be explicitly blessed by the bishop to wear it following his ordination to the diaconate.
* A cassock vest (&quot;kontorasson&quot; (Œ∫ŒøŒΩœÑœåœÅŒ±œÉŒøŒΩ), &quot;amaniko&quot; (Œ±ŒºŒ¨ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œø), &quot;gileko&quot; (Œ≥ŒπŒªŒ≠Œ∫Œø)) is sometimes worn over the inner cassock. This is a closely fitted collarless vest, usually falling slightly below the waist. The vest has its origins in the outer cassock and therefore should be worn only by clergy and monastics who would, in formal or liturgical settings, wear the outer cassock.
* A cassock coat may be worn on very cold days, with the same cut as the outer cassock but slightly larger and of heavier material. It may or may not have a fur-lined collar. The coat is worn over the outer cassock, although many clerics may wear it in lieu of a coat on colder days.

==== Eastern Catholic and Orthodox examples ====
==== Oriental Orthodox examples ====
== Non-clerical 17th-century garment ==
The term &quot;cassock&quot; can also refer to a loose-fitting, pullover, hip-length jacket worn by ordinary soldiers in the 17th century. A cassock has attached sleeves and is open down the sides, similar to a mandilion. Such garments are popularly recognized as the formal uniform of the Musketeers of the Guard in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;¬†‚Äì though this is suspect historically.

<text>Mysophilia is a paraphilia where erotic pleasure is derived from filth. Mysophiles may find dirt, soiled underwear, feces, unwashed people, or vomit to be sexually arousing.

People with mysophilia have been known to be aroused by unclean locations, such as an alleyway or a dirty bathroom, and behaviors, such as not bathing for many days at a time.

==In culture==
The protagonist of the novel &quot;Wetlands&quot;, and the film based on the book, would be considered a mysophiliac, deriving pleasure from not washing and from dirty locations, such as toilets.

Napoleon Bonaparte, while campaigning in 1796, wrote to his wife Jos√©phine: &quot;Please don&#x27;t wash, will arrive in three days&quot;. This can be interpreted as mysophiliac behaviour if it is assumed this was to ensure her clothes, as well as her person, were soiled.

<doc id="331204" wikidata="Q814709" url="?curid=331204" title="Beignet">
<text>Beignet ( , , ; ) is a type of deep-fried pastry of French origin. It is commonly made from p√¢te √† choux, but can also be made using rice flour (rice beignets) or yeast-leavened batters. Beignets can be served in a variety of preparations, the most common being dusted with confectioner‚Äôs sugar. The pastry is popular in French, Italian, and American cuisines.

==Types==

A traditional way beignets are prepared is using choux pastry dough. Otherwise known as the French-style beignet, this type of dough is typically made using butter, milk or water, sugar, flour, and salt. Choux pastry is versatile and is prepared differently by culture. The p√¢te √† choux method is also the style of beignets that were introduced to New Orleans by French immigrants in the 1700s.

Variations often include banana or plantain¬†‚Äì popular fruits in the port city ‚Äì or berries. Other variations include savory fillings such as meat and cheese fillings.

Beignets can also be made with yeast pastry, which might be referred to as &quot;boules de Berlin&quot; in French, referring to Berliner doughnuts, which lack the typical doughnut hole in the center, filled with fruit or jam.

In Corsica, beignets made with chestnut flour () are known as &quot;fritelli&quot;.

In Canadian French, doughnuts are referred to alternately as &quot;beigne&quot; or &quot;beignet&quot;.

In former French colonial empire in West Africa, a &quot;beignet&quot; is a small ball of fried dough, in Senegal sometimes made with millet flour rather than wheat, equivalent to a Puff-puff.

==Origins==

Variations of fried dough can be found across cuisines internationally; however, the origin of the term &quot;beignet&quot; is specifically French. They were brought to New Orleans in the 18th century by French colonists, from &quot;the old mother country&quot;, also brought by Acadians, and became a large part of home-style Creole cooking.

Deep-fried yeast dough has been part of culinary tradition since at least the Middle Ages. The Spanish refer to this type of creation as &quot;buelos&quot;, which likely shares etymology with the Celtic word for deep-fried yeast dough, &quot;bigne&quot;.

==Louisiana==

Louisiana-style beignets are generally square or rectangular shaped, and are made from leavened dough rather than choux pastry. In New Orleans, they are often consumed as a breakfast item served with powdered sugar on top. They are meant to be eaten immediately after frying and are served at several cafes in the New Orleans region. 

In the United States, beignets have been popular within New Orleans Creole cuisine and may also be served as a dessert.

It is one of only two official state donuts‚Äîthe only other one being the &quot;Boston cream doughnut&quot;, the state donut of Massachusetts.

==Preparation==

Ingredients used to prepare beignets typically include:
* Lukewarm water
* Granulated sugar
* Evaporated milk
* Bread flour
* Shortening
* Oil or lard, for deep-frying
* Confectioners&#x27; sugar
* Yeast (for leavened batters)

Preparation varies by type. For yeast-leavened beignets, 
the ingredients are combined and a dough has formed, it is rolled out and then sliced into squares which are deep-fried for two to three minutes. The result is a puffy, golden brown pastry.

For choux pastry beignets, the chilled dough is piped or scooped before being fried in hot oil.

<doc id="331205" wikidata="Q3108240" url="?curid=331205" title="Tim Wakefield">
<text>Timothy Stephen Wakefield (August 2, 1966 ‚Äì October 1, 2023) was an American professional baseball knuckleball pitcher. Wakefield began his Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but is most remembered for his 17-year tenure with the Boston Red Sox, from 1995 until his retirement in 2012 as the longest-serving player on the team, earning a total of $55 million. When he retired at age 45 after 19 seasons in MLB, Wakefield was the oldest active player in the major leagues.

Wakefield won his 200th career game on September 13, 2011, and he ranks third in career wins in Red Sox franchise history (186), behind Cy Young and Roger Clemens. He is second in all-time wins at Fenway Park with 97, behind Clemens&#x27;s 100, and is the all-time leader in innings pitched by a Red Sox pitcher, with 3,006, having surpassed Clemens&#x27;s total of 2,777 on June 8, 2010. Wakefield was an All-Star in 2009 and he won the Roberto Clemente Award in 2010.

==Early life==
Wakefield was born in Melbourne, Florida, on August 2, 1966. He attended Eau Gallie High School and then attended Florida Institute of Technology, where he played college baseball for the Florida Tech Panthers. At Florida Tech, he was named the Panthers&#x27; team most valuable player as a first baseman in his sophomore and junior years. He set a single-season Panthers record with 22 home runs, as well as the career home run record at 40. In 2006, his uniform number, No.¬†3, was retired by the college.

==Professional career==

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
====Draft and minor leagues====

The Pittsburgh Pirates selected Wakefield as a first baseman in the eighth round of the 1988 MLB draft. He received a $15,000 signing bonus from the Pirates. After a scout told him that he would never get above Double-A ball as a position player with his skills, Wakefield decided to re-invent himself as a knuckleball pitcher.

The following season, Wakefield made his professional pitching debut while playing for the Single-A Salem Buccaneers. His immediate success led to a full conversion to pitcher in 1990, and he led the Carolina League in starts and innings pitched. Wakefield advanced to Double-A in 1991, leading all Pirates minor leaguers in wins, innings pitched, and complete games when he went 15‚Äì8 with a 2.90 earned run average.

====1992‚Äì1994====
In 1992, Wakefield began the season with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons of the American Association. He registered a league-high six complete games by July 31‚Äîwinning 10 games with a 3.06 earned run average‚Äîand was called up to the majors. In his major league debut, Wakefield threw a complete game against the St. Louis Cardinals, striking out 10 batters while throwing 146 pitches.

Down the stretch, Wakefield provided a boost for the playoff-bound Pirates, starting 13 games and compiling an 8‚Äì1 record with a 2.15 earned run average, a performance that won him the National League Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award from &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. After winning the National League East division, the Pirates faced the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series. Wakefield won both of his starts against Braves star Tom Glavine, throwing a complete game five-hitter in Game 3 of the NLCS and another complete game in Game 6 on three days&#x27; rest. The Braves would win Game 7 to advance to the World Series.

The Pirates named Wakefield their Opening Day starter for the 1993 season. Wakefield walked nine batters on Opening Day. After losing his spot in the starting rotation, Wakefield was sent down to Double-A in July. He was recalled in September and struggled again, finishing the season with a 6‚Äì11 record and a 5.61 earned run average.

Wakefield spent most of 1994 with Triple-A Buffalo. He led the league in losses, walks, and home runs allowed. Wakefield was recalled to the Pirates in September but he did not play due to the players strike. The Pirates released Wakefield on April 20, 1995.

===Boston Red Sox===
Six days after being released from the Pirates, Wakefield was signed by the Boston Red Sox. He worked with Phil and Joe Niekro, two former knuckleballers, who encouraged him to use the knuckleball as an out pitch. With the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, Wakefield went 2‚Äì1 with a 2.52 earned run average.

====1995‚Äì1998====

With the Boston Red Sox rotation struggling from injuries to top of the rotation starters Roger Clemens and Aaron Sele early in the 1995 season, Wakefield was called up from Triple-A, and soon proved to be their most dependable starter. He began the season with a 1.65 earned run average and a 14‚Äì1 record through 17 games, six of which were complete games. He ended the year 16‚Äì8 with a 2.95 earned run average, helping the Red Sox win the American League East division title, and capturing the &quot;Sporting News&quot; American League Comeback Player of the Year. He finished third in the AL Cy Young Award balloting.

Over the next three seasons (1996‚Äì1998), Wakefield won 43 games and had earned run averages of 5.14, 4.25, and 4.58 over that time as a starter. In 1997, he led Major League Baseball by hitting 16 batters with a pitch. He would repeat this feat in 2001 plunking a career-high 18 batters.

====1999‚Äì2002====
In 1999, Boston&#x27;s closer Tom Gordon was injured and manager Jimy Williams installed Wakefield as the new closer during the middle part of the season. On August 10, 1999, he joined a select group of pitchers who have struck out four batters in one inning. Because the fluttering knuckleball produces many passed balls, several knuckleballers share this honor with him. He recorded 15 saves before Derek Lowe emerged as the new closer and Wakefield returned to the starting rotation.

Because of his success out of the bullpen, Wakefield was regularly moved from the position of relief pitcher to starter and back again over the next three seasons (2000‚Äì2002). He made 15 starts in 2002.

====2003‚Äì2008====
Wakefield returned to Boston&#x27;s starting rotation permanently in 2003. In that season&#x27;s American League Championship Series, he allowed four runs over 14 innings against the New York Yankees. He started Games 1 and 4 of the series against Mike Mussina and won both starts. He was also called in to pitch in extra innings of Game 7, after the Yankees tied the game. The Red Sox had been leading 5‚Äì2 in the eighth inning. After retiring the side in order in the 10th, Wakefield gave up a home run to Aaron Boone on his first pitch of the 11th, sending the Yankees to the World Series. Wakefield apologized to fans after the game.
In 2004, Wakefield helped the Red Sox win the American League Championship Series against the Yankees, a best-of-seven series to advance to the World Series. The Red Sox lost the first two games of the American League Championship Series and were losing badly in Game 3 when Wakefield asked to be put into the game to save the other pitchers for the next day. He pitched innings which prevented him from starting Game 4. Derek Lowe started Game 4 in his place which the Red Sox ultimately won. In Game 5, Wakefield again pitched out of the bullpen and was the winning pitcher in a 14-inning game, throwing three shutout innings as the Red Sox won 5‚Äì4. The Red Sox beat the Yankees and went on to the World Series. He pitched Game 1 of the 2004 World Series, but did not get a decision as Boston defeated the St. Louis Cardinals, 11‚Äì9, which was the highest-scoring Game 1 in World Series history. The Red Sox swept the Cardinals for their first World Series title in 86 years.

On April 19, 2005, Wakefield agreed to a $4 million, one-year &quot;rolling&quot; contract extension that gave the Red Sox the ability to keep Wakefield for the rest of his career. In the 2005 season, Wakefield led the Red Sox pitching staff with 16 wins and a 4.15 earned run average. On September 11, 2005, he set a career high in strikeouts (12) in a 1‚Äì0 complete game loss to the New York Yankees.

In 2007, Wakefield finished the season with a 17‚Äì12 record and started Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, taking the loss, but was left off the Red Sox roster for the World Series due to an injured shoulder that had been bothering him since late September.

The 12 passed balls while he was pitching topped the majors in 2008.

====2009====
Wakefield entered his 15th season with the Boston Red Sox in 2009. On April 15, 2009, a day after the Red Sox bullpen was tasked with pitching over 11 innings of relief, telling manager Terry Francona not to remove him from the game. He pitched a no-hitter into the eighth inning, and earned a complete game win. At 42, this made him the oldest Red Sox pitcher to pitch a complete game, a record he would break himself in his next start when he pitched a second consecutive complete game win, this time in a seven-inning, rain-shortened game.

Wakefield led the team with a 10‚Äì3 record through June 27. With his start on July 3, 2009, Wakefield surpassed Roger Clemens for the most starts in franchise history. His success on the mound had him atop the major leagues with 10 wins at the time of the 2009 All-Star selection. On July 5, 2009, he was announced as an AL All-Star, making him the second-oldest first-time All-Star at 42, behind only Satchel Paige who was 45. By the All-Star break, Wakefield possessed a major league-best 11‚Äì3 record. Wakefield did not see action in St. Louis, as he was not needed by Joe Maddon. On July 21, Wakefield was placed on the disabled list due to a lower back strain. He returned from the disabled list on August 26 against the Chicago White Sox, pitching seven innings while allowing one earned run to earn a no decision.

====2010====
Wakefield entered his 16th season with the Boston Red Sox in 2010. He began the year in the starting rotation until Daisuke Matsuzaka came off the disabled list. He later rejoined the rotation due to an injury to Josh Beckett. On May 12, Wakefield recorded his 2,000th career strikeout against Vernon Wells of the Toronto Blue Jays in a 3‚Äì2 loss. He joined Jamie Moyer, Javier V√°zquez, and Andy Pettitte as the only active pitchers with at least 2,000 career strikeouts. On June 8, Wakefield passed Roger Clemens for the most innings pitched by a Red Sox pitcher. He went on to win that game 3‚Äì2 over the Cleveland Indians. On June 13, Wakefield joined Moyer and Pettitte as the only active pitchers with 3,000 innings pitched. He accomplished this feat by retiring Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies on a fly ball to left. On July 2, he surpassed Clemens for another record, this for starts at Fenway Park; he went eight innings to win 3‚Äì2 over the Baltimore Orioles.

On September 8, against the Tampa Bay Rays, he became the oldest Red Sox pitcher ever to win a game; he is also the oldest player to appear in a game for the Red Sox at Fenway.

On October 28, before Game 2 of the 2010 World Series, Wakefield received the Roberto Clemente Award.

====2011====
Wakefield&#x27;s 2011 season was followed in the documentary film &quot;Knuckleball!&quot; Wakefield started his seventeenth season in a Red Sox uniform as a reliever, but injuries to John Lackey and Daisuke Matsuzaka moved him into the starting rotation.

On May 11, 2011, Wakefield pitched innings in relief as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Red Sox 9‚Äì3 at the Rogers Centre. He became, at 44 years, 282 days, the oldest player ever to appear for the Red Sox. At the All-Star break, Wakefield had a 5‚Äì3 record with a 4.74 earned run average. On July 24, 2011, while pitching against the Seattle Mariners, Wakefield recorded his 2,000th strikeout in a Red Sox uniform against Mike Carp; he also recorded his 199th career win in that game.

It took Wakefield eight attempts to earn his 200th career win after his 199th, finally doing so in an 18‚Äì6 rout over the Toronto Blue Jays at Fenway Park on September 13, 2011. The victory came at a time when the Red Sox were in dire need of wins, with the Tampa Bay Rays gaining substantial ground in the race for the American League wild card as Boston fell four games behind the New York Yankees in the AL East division standings. Boston eventually missed the playoffs by one game, and Wakefield ended the season at 7‚Äì8 with a 5.12 earned run average.
For the 2012 season, Wakefield was offered a minor league contract, with an invitation to spring training, by the Red Sox. Wakefield announced his retirement on February 17, 2012.

Wakefield finished his Red Sox career third in wins (behind Roger Clemens and Cy Young), second in strikeouts (behind Clemens), second in game appearances by a pitcher (behind reliever Bob Stanley), first in games started as a pitcher, and first in innings pitched.

==Playing style==
===Pitching style===

Wakefield pitched with a -overhand motion. This also revealed some of his pitches to hitters, because they could see his hand. Wakefield&#x27;s primary pitch, the knuckleball, was thrown between and had a great deal of variance in how much it &quot;fluttered&quot;. The flutter of his knuckleball depended on a variety of factors including temperature, humidity, precipitation (both type and intensity), air resistance, wind speed, wind direction, the condition of the ball, and very small changes in his grip or the orientation of the seams. Wakefield also featured a fastball and a curveball which averaged between .

Knuckleball pitchers are traditionally believed to be able to pitch more frequently and for more pitches per game than conventional pitchers. Throughout the first decade of his career, Wakefield followed a similar pattern: on April 27, 1993, he threw 172 pitches over 10+ innings in a game for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the Atlanta Braves. In his first two weeks with the Red Sox, Wakefield pitched a total of innings, including two complete games in addition to a -inning emergency start on just two days&#x27; rest. As late as the 2003 and 2004 American League Championship Series, Wakefield was making relief appearances between starts. In the later years of his career, the Red Sox generally treated Wakefield more like conventional pitchers in terms of pitch count, rarely allowing him to pitch more than about 110 pitches per game, and giving him four days of rest. Also, because of the relatively low wear on their pitching arms, knuckleball pitchers tend to have longer professional careers than most other pitchers.

At the time of his retirement, Wakefield was seventh on the all-time hit batters list.

===Personal catcher===
Because of the difficulty of catching a knuckleball, the Red Sox sometimes carried a backup catcher who specialized in defense and who caught most or all of Wakefield&#x27;s starts. For several years, his personal catcher was Doug Mirabelli, who used a league-approved mitt similar to a softball catcher&#x27;s mitt for catching Wakefield. Josh Bard briefly caught Wakefield during the first month of the 2006 season, before Boston reacquired Mirabelli on May 1 after trading him to San Diego the previous offseason. Mirabelli was released in the spring of 2008 and Wakefield&#x27;s catcher was Kevin Cash during 2008. George Kottaras became his personal catcher in 2009. Victor Martinez was acquired by the Red Sox on July 31, 2009, and began catching for Wakefield on August 26, 2009. Martinez experimented catching Wakefield&#x27;s pitches with various gloves and mitts before settling on a first baseman&#x27;s mitt.

Due to injuries to both Martinez and Jason Varitek, Boston reacquired Cash from the Houston Astros on July 1, 2010, to serve as Wakefield&#x27;s catcher as well as the primary catcher. Martinez became Wakefield&#x27;s catcher once more when he returned. In 2011, Wakefield began the season in the bullpen and both Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Jason Varitek caught him when he entered games. When Wakefield returned to the rotation, Saltalamacchia was the catcher in each game he started.

==Post-MLB career==
In June 2012, Wakefield joined NESN as a studio analyst for Red Sox coverage. He continued to serve as a studio analyst through the 2023 season.

In August 2015, Wakefield signed on as a spokesperson for Farmington Bank, making appearances at branch grand openings and in television, radio, and print advertisements.

==Personal life==

Wakefield became an evangelical Christian in 1990. 
Wakefield met his wife, Stacy Stover, in Massachusetts and they were married on November 9, 2002. They had two children, Trevor (born 2004) and Brianna (born 2005). In 2010, Wakefield bought a house in Indian Harbour Beach, Florida, for $1,825,000. Wakefield was part owner of a restaurant in Pembroke, Massachusetts, called Turner&#x27;s Yard. One of his partners in the restaurant was National Hockey League player Shawn Thornton.

===Philanthropy===
Wakefield was nominated eight times by the Red Sox for the Roberto Clemente Award, presented to the player who best reflects the spirit of giving back to the community, winning the award in 2010. Wakefield partnered with the Franciscan Hospital for Children in Boston to bring patients to Fenway Park to share time with him on and off the field.

Wakefield hosted an annual celebrity golf tournament, raising over $10 million for the Space Coast Early Intervention Center, a pre-school program for children with special needs.

Wakefield was also active with New England&#x27;s Pitching In for Kids organization, a program dedicated to improving the lives of children across the New England region, and the Touch &#x27;Em All Foundation founded by Garth Brooks.

In 2007, Wakefield released a charity wine called CaberKnuckle, in association with Longball Vineyards, with 100% of the proceeds supporting Pitching in for Kids; the wine raised more than $100,000.

In 2013, the Red Sox named Wakefield Honorary Chairman of the Red Sox Foundation. In that role, Wakefield supported fundraising events, community service days, and personal visits.

==Death==
On October 1, 2023, Wakefield died at his home in Massachusetts of a seizure resulting from brain cancer. He was 57. The cancer diagnosis had been revealed days earlier by Curt Schilling, Wakefield&#x27;s former Red Sox teammate, stirring controversy because the release of this news was not authorized by Wakefield or his family.

On February 28, 2024, his widow, Stacy Wakefield, died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 53.

On March 18, 2024, the Red Sox announced that they would be wearing his uniform number as a patch for the entirety of the 2024 season.

On April 9, 2024, the 2004 Red Sox reunited at Fenway Park for their 20th anniversary celebration on Opening Day against the Orioles. The pregame ceremony was also dedicated to the Wakefields, along with Red Sox president Larry Lucchino, who died of heart failure on April 2 at the age of 78. Wakefield&#x27;s children, Brianna and Trevor, led the 2004 team in from left field. Brianna threw the ceremonial first pitch to Jason Varitek.

<text>Saharon Shelah (; , ; born July 3, 1945) is an Israeli mathematician. He is a professor of mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Rutgers University in New Jersey.

==Biography==
Shelah was born in Jerusalem on July 3, 1945. He is the son of the Israeli poet and political activist Yonatan Ratosh. He received his PhD for his work on stable theories in 1969 from the Hebrew University.

Shelah is married to Yael, and has three children. His brother, magistrate judge Hamman Shelah was murdered along with his wife and daughter by an Egyptian soldier in the Ras Burqa massacre in 1985.

Shelah planned to be a scientist while at primary school, but initially was attracted to physics and biology, not mathematics. Later he found mathematical beauty in studying geometry: He said, &quot;But when I reached the ninth grade I began studying geometry and my eyes opened to that beauty‚Äîa system of demonstration and theorems based on a very small number of axioms which impressed me and captivated me.&quot; At the age of 15, he decided to become a mathematician, a choice cemented after reading Abraham Halevy Fraenkel&#x27;s book &quot;An Introduction to Mathematics&quot;.

He received a B.Sc. from Tel Aviv University in 1964, served in the Israel Defense Forces Army between 1964 and 1967, and obtained a M.Sc. from the Hebrew University (under the direction of Haim Gaifman) in 1967. He then worked as a teaching assistant at the Institute of Mathematics of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem while completing a Ph.D. there under the supervision of Michael Oser Rabin, on a study of stable theories.

Shelah was a lecturer at Princeton University during 1969‚Äì70, and then worked as an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles during 1970‚Äì71. He became a professor at Hebrew University in 1974, a position he continues to hold.

He has been a visiting professor at the following universities: the University of Wisconsin (1977‚Äì78), the University of California, Berkeley (1978 and 1982), the University of Michigan (1984‚Äì85), at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia (1985), and Rutgers University, New Jersey (1985). He has been a distinguished visiting professor at Rutgers University since 1986.

==Academic career==
Shelah&#x27;s main interests lie in mathematical logic, model theory in particular, and in axiomatic set theory.

In model theory, he developed &quot;classification theory&quot;, which led him to a solution of Morley&#x27;s problem. In set theory, he discovered the notion of proper forcing, an important tool in iterated forcing arguments. With PCF theory, he showed that in spite of the undecidability of the most basic questions of cardinal arithmetic (such as the continuum hypothesis), there are still highly nontrivial ZFC theorems about cardinal exponentiation. Shelah constructed a J√≥nsson group, an uncountable group for which every proper subgroup is countable. He showed that Whitehead&#x27;s problem is independent of ZFC. He gave the first primitive recursive upper bound to van der Waerden&#x27;s numbers V(C,N). He extended Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem on voting systems.

Shelah&#x27;s work has had a deep impact on model theory and set theory. The tools he developed for his classification theory have been applied to a wide number of topics and problems in model theory and have led to great advances in stability theory and its uses in algebra and algebraic geometry as shown for example by Ehud Hrushovski and many others. Classification theory involves deep work developed in many dozens of papers to completely solve the spectrum problem on classification of first order theories in terms of structure and number of nonisomorphic models, a huge tour de force. Following that he has extended the work far beyond first order theories, for example for abstract elementary classes. This work also has had important applications to algebra by works of Boris Zilber.

<doc id="331213" wikidata="Q1268048" url="?curid=331213" title="League of Communists of Croatia">
<text>League of Communists of Croatia (, SKH) was the Croatian branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ). It came into power in 1945. Until 1952, it was known as Communist Party of Croatia (, KPH). The party dissolved in 1990.

== History ==

=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===
The party was formally founded in 1937 with Pavle Gregoriƒá as its first general secretary. The reasons for KPJ to have its specifically Croatian branch were partly ideological, partly practical. Croatia, just as Slovenia, which would have its Communist Party at the same time, was the most industrialised part of the country, with the biggest percentage of working class in the population, and, therefore, more likely to adopt communism than rural Serbia.

The other, more practical, reason was in the increased marginalisation of Communists in Croatian political life due to public more preoccupied with ethnic issues and position of Croatia within Yugoslavia (cf. Croatia in the first Yugoslavia). Territorial aspirations of Fascist Italy towards Croatian parts of Yugoslavia also presented opportunity for the creation of broad Communist-dominated alliances modelled on Popular Front.

Prior to the formation of the Communist Party of Croatia there was a Croatian-Slavonian Provincial Committee of the Socialist Workers Party of Yugoslavia (Communists) and there was a developed party structure of the Socialist Party of Croatia and Slavonia. Dalmatia had its own structures up to 1937.

KPH, just like KPJ, was illegal and, therefore, remained marginalised, especially after the 1939 Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement and the creation of the banovina of Croatia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Party&#x27;s fortunes dramatically changed with the 1941 Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and creation of the Independent State of Croatia. At the beginning of the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, Aleksandar Rankoviƒá was secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia. Although KPH had many of its leading figures arrested and killed by new regime, it remained strong enough to form what would become the only truly effective resistance movement in Croatia ‚Äì the Partisans. KPH was based on ideological rather than ethnic grounds and, therefore, had support in both ethnic Croat and ethnic Serb areas. This allowed Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans to mount ultimately successful guerrilla campaign. KPH platform of post-war reorganisation of Yugoslavia on federal grounds also attracted many non-Communist Croatians to its cause, especially in the later stages of war.

=== SFR Yugoslavia ===

In 1945 Yugoslavia was indeed federalised with Croatia becoming a republic, but its nominal autonomy was of little importance with KPJ being heavily centralised and KPH ‚Äì renamed into SKH in 1952 ‚Äì being its integral part.
Things began to change in late 1960s with Tito allowing for reformist policies embodied of new generation of Communist leaders. This generation included SKH leaders Savka Dabƒçeviƒá-Kuƒçar and Miko Tripalo who would start movement called the Croatian Spring, advocating for more autonomy of Croatia within Yugoslavia. They advocated against centralism which disproportionately benefited the eastern parts of Yugoslavia, especially Serbia and SR Macedonia.

The movement, however, created a lot of ethnic tension and increasing opposition from the more conservative Party members. In December 1971, on the Karaƒëorƒëevo conference of the SKJ, Tito publicly distanced himself from Croatian Spring, leading to the end of the movement. Using the alleged Croatian nationalism as a pretext, SKH was subsequently purged from most of its liberal and reformist elements.

As a result, SKH in the 1970s became one of the most conservative sections of SKJ and remained interested in maintaining ideological and political status quo even when other branches of SKJ began to explore new ideas.

Because of that, SKH in late 1980s was slow to react when League of Communists of Serbia under Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá aimed to reassert internal Serbian interest. SKH began to openly condemn Milo≈°eviƒá only in 1989 after Serbian nationalist demonstrations in areas that would later become Republic of Serbian Krajina.

It is estimated that in the 1980s, during its zenith, the SKH had around 300-400,000 members. Subsequent surveys showed that most of the membership left the party in 1990, with only minority remaining active in politics. Of those, majority joined the HDZ.

=== Party of Democratic Changes ===

With increasingly apparent prospect of SKH being forced to allow some form of multi-party democracy and having its power tested on free elections, the party changed policy and quickly adopted a new reformist platform and pushed for the constitutional amendments allowing first free elections in 1990.

In January 1990 the Croatian Party delegation led by Ivica Raƒçan left the 14th Congress of SKJ, a few hours after the Slovenian Party delegation did so over a row with the Serbian Party delegation.

In the next few months, SKH tried very hard to present itself as modern and reformist party, rebranding itself into a new party called the League of Communists of Croatia - Party of Democratic Changes (&quot;Savez komunista Hrvatske - Stranka demokratskih promjena&quot;, SKH-SDP), then to just Party of Democratic Changes (&quot;Stranka demokratskih promjena&quot;, SDP).

Those and other changes, however, weren&#x27;t very convincing to the Croatian electorate and SKH lost power to Croatian Democratic Union of Franjo Tuƒëman.

In 1991, it was renamed to Socialdemocratic Party of Croatia‚ÄìParty of Democratic Changes (&quot;Socijaldemokratska partija Hrvatske‚ÄìStranka demokratskih promjena&quot;, SDPH), that would ultimately become the Social Democratic Party of Croatia in 1993.

== Ethno-nationalist issues ==

Another reason why the Party lost support in Croatia was because it was accused of being dominated by the Serb minority. The Serb influence was indeed disproportionate at times. In 1989, 30% of the members of the Croatian League of Communists were Serbs, while their overall percentage in the republic was less than 13%.

Serbs held the presidency of the party twice, one up to 1942 with Rade Konƒçar, the other from 1986 until 1989 by Stanko Stojƒçeviƒá.

=== Ethnic composition of the governments ===

== Revival ==
On 29 November 2004 ‚Äì the date specifically chosen as Republic Day, former public holiday in socialist Yugoslavia ‚Äì a group of Socialist Labour Party of Croatia dissidents in Vukovar tried to found new political party called Communist Party of Croatia, but in the end they failed to register and organize. A new was founded in 2013 and became a registered party in the same year.

This new party should not be mistaken with KPH/SKH, because, unlike Social Democratic Party of Croatia, it is not its formal successor.

<doc id="331219" wikidata="Q33772" url="?curid=331219" title="Du Fu">
<text>Du Fu (; 712‚Äì770) was a Chinese poet and politician during the Tang dynasty. Together with his elder contemporary and friend Li Bai, Du is often considered one of the greatest Chinese poets. His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant, but Du proved unable to make the necessary accommodations. His life, like all of China, was devastated by the An Lushan rebellion of 755, and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest.

Although initially he was little-known to other writers, his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture. Of his poetic writing, nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages. He has been called the &quot;Poet-Historian&quot; and the &quot;Poet-Sage&quot; by Chinese critics, while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as &quot;the Chinese Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Shakespeare, Milton, Burns, Wordsworth, B√©ranger, Hugo or Baudelaire&quot;.

== Life ==
Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasised the life of the author when interpreting a work, a practice which the American scholar Burton Watson attributed to &quot;the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality&quot;. Since many of Du Fu&#x27;s poems feature morality and history, this practice is particularly important. Another reason, identified by the Chinese historian William Hung, is that Chinese poems are typically concise, omitting context that might be relevant, but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know. For modern Western readers, &quot;The less accurately we know the time, the place and the circumstances in the background, the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly, and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether&quot;. Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu, arguing that the variety of the poet&#x27;s work required consideration of his whole life, rather than the &quot;reductive&quot; categorisations used for more limited poets.

=== Early years ===
Most of what is known of Du Fu&#x27;s life comes from his poems. His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690‚Äì705). Du Fu was born in 712; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province (Gong county is a favourite candidate). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang&#x27;an, ancestral hometown of the Du family.

Du Fu&#x27;s mother died shortly after he was born, and he was partially raised by his aunt. He had an elder brother, who died young. He also had three half brothers and one half sister, to whom he frequently refers in his poems, although he never mentions his stepmother.

The son of a minor scholar-official, his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant: study and memorisation of the Confucian classics of philosophy, history and poetry. He later claimed to have produced creditable poems by his early teens, but these have been lost.

In the early 730s, he travelled in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area; his earliest surviving poem, describing a poetry contest, is thought to date from the end of this period, around 735. In that year, he took the Imperial examination, likely in Chang&#x27;an. He failed, to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure, he went back to travelling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.

His father died around 740. Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father&#x27;s rank, but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers. He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area, fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs.

In the autumn of 744, he met Li Bai (Li Po) for the first time, and the two poets formed a friendship. David Young describes this as &quot;the most significant formative element in Du Fu&#x27;s artistic development&quot; because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet-scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam. The relationship was somewhat one-sided, however. Du Fu was by some years the younger, while Li Bai was already a poetic star. We have twelve poems to or about Li Bai from the younger poet, but only one in the other direction. They met again only once, in 745.

In 746, he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career. He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year, but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister (apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals). He never again attempted the examinations, instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751, 754 and probably again in 755. He married around 752, and by 757 the couple had had five children‚Äîthree sons and two daughters‚Äîbut one of the sons died in infancy in 755. From 754 he began to have lung problems (probably asthma), the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life. It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region.

In 755, he received an appointment as Registrar of the Right Commandant&#x27;s office of the Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace. Although this was a minor post, in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career. Even before he had begun work, however, the position was swept away by events.

=== War ===
The An Lushan rebellion began in December 755, and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years. It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society: the census of 754 recorded 52.9¬†million people, but ten years later, the census counted just 16.9¬†million, the remainder having been displaced or killed.
During this time, Du Fu led a largely itinerant life unsettled by wars, associated famines and imperial displeasure. This period of unhappiness was the making of Du Fu as a poet: Eva Shan Chou has written that, &quot;What he saw around him‚Äîthe lives of his family, neighbors, and strangers‚Äì what he heard, and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns‚Äîthese became the enduring themes of his poetry&quot;. Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child, he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own misfortunes. Du Fu wrote:

In 756, Emperor Xuanzong was forced to flee the capital and abdicate. Du Fu, who had been away from the city, took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor (Suzong), but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang&#x27;an. In the autumn, his youngest son, Du Zongwu (Baby Bear), was born. Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria.

He escaped from Chang&#x27;an the following year, and was appointed Reminder when he rejoined the court in May 757. This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial. Du Fu&#x27;s conscientiousness compelled him to try to make use of it: he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge. He was arrested but was pardoned in June. He was granted leave to visit his family in September, but he soon rejoined the court and on 8 December 757, he returned to Chang&#x27;an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces. However, his advice continued to be unappreciated, and in the summer of 758 he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in Huazhou. The position was not to his taste: in one poem, he wrote:
He moved on in the summer of 759; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine, but Hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason. He next spent around six weeks in Qinzhou (now Tianshui, Gansu province), where he wrote more than sixty poems.

=== Chengdu ===
In December 759, he briefly stayed in Tonggu (modern Gansu). He departed on 24 December for Chengdu (in Sichuan), where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di. Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years. By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances. He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu. Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life. Many of Du&#x27;s poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at Du Fu Thatched Cottage. In 762, he left the city to escape a rebellion, but he returned in summer 764 when he was appointed an advisor to Yan, who was involved in campaigns against the Tibetan Empire.

=== Last years ===
Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They travelled slowly, held up by his ill-health (by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments). They stayed in Kuizhou (in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766. This period was Du Fu&#x27;s last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style. In autumn 766, Bo Maolin became governor of the region: he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary.

In March 768, he resumed his journey and got as far as Hunan province, where he died in Tanzhou (now Changsha) in November or December 770, in his 58th year. He was survived by his wife and two sons, who remained in the area for some years at least. His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuan Zhen in 813.

Hung summarises his life by concluding that, &quot;He appeared to be a filial son, an affectionate father, a generous brother, a faithful husband, a loyal friend, a dutiful official, and a patriotic subject.&quot;

Below is an example of one of Du Fu&#x27;s later works. Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends, which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces:

=== Health ===
Du Fu is the first person in the historical record identified as a diabetic patient. In his later years, he suffered from diabetes and pulmonary tuberculosis, and died on board a ship on the Yangtze, aged 58 years old.

== Works ==
Criticism of Du Fu&#x27;s works has focused on his strong sense of history, his moral engagement, and his technical excellence.

=== History ===
Since the Song dynasty, critics have called Du Fu the &quot;poet for history&quot; (, &quot; shƒ´ sh«ê&quot;). The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government, or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor. Indirectly, he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself, and on the ordinary people of China. As Watson notes, this is information &quot;of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era&quot;.

Du Fu&#x27;s political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation: his prescriptions have been paraphrased as, &quot;Let us all be less selfish, let us all do what we are supposed to do&quot;. Since his views were impossible to disagree with, his forcefully expressed truisms enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history.

=== Moral engagement ===
A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of &quot;poet sage&quot; (, &quot;shƒ´ sh√®ng&quot;), a counterpart to the philosophical sage, Confucius. One of the earliest surviving works, &quot;The Song of the Wagons&quot; (from around 750), gives voice to the sufferings of a conscript soldier in the imperial army and a clear-sighted consciousness of suffering. These concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life.

Although Du Fu&#x27;s frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all-consuming solipsism, Hawkes argues that his &quot;famous compassion in fact includes himself, viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought&quot;. He therefore &quot;lends grandeur&quot; to the wider picture by comparing it to &quot;his own slightly comical triviality&quot;.

Du Fu&#x27;s compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry: he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment. Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, &quot;everything in this world is poetry&quot;, Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems.

=== Technical excellence ===
Du Fu&#x27;s work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term (&quot;j√≠d√†ch√©ng&quot;, &quot;complete symphony&quot;), a reference to Mencius&#x27; description of Confucius. Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu&#x27;s achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor &quot;united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly&quot;. He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry: Chou says that in every form he &quot;either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples&quot;. Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of registers, from the direct and colloquial to the allusive and self-consciously literary. This variety is manifested even within individual works: Owen identifies the, &quot;rapid stylistic and thematic shifts&quot; in poems which enable the poet to represent different facets of a situation, while Chou uses the term &quot;juxtaposition&quot; as the major analytical tool in her work. Du Fu is noted for having written more on poetics and painting than any other writer of his time. He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone, more than any other Tang poet. Du Fu&#x27;s seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Han Gan ignited a controversy that has persisted to the present day.

The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings (&quot;chameleon-like&quot; according to Watson): his earliest works are in a relatively derivative, courtly style, but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion. Owen comments on the &quot;grim simplicity&quot; of the Qinzhou poems, which mirrors the desert landscape; the works from his Chengdu period are &quot;light, often finely observed&quot;; while the poems from the late Kuizhou period have a &quot;density and power of vision&quot;.

Although he wrote in all poetic forms, Du Fu is best known for his &quot;l√ºshi&quot;, a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content, for example:
About two-thirds of Du Fu&#x27;s 1500 extant works are in this form, and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent. His best &quot;l«úshi&quot; use the parallelisms required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions. Hawkes comments that &quot;it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner&quot;.

== Influence ==
According to the &quot;Encyclop√¶dia Britannica&quot;, Du Fu&#x27;s writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time, and it states &quot;his dense, compressed language makes use of all the connotative overtones of a phrase and of all the intonational potentials of the individual word, qualities that no translation can ever reveal.&quot;

In his lifetime and immediately following his death, Du Fu was not greatly appreciated. In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations, some of which are still &quot;considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics.&quot; There are few contemporary references to him‚Äîonly eleven poems from six writers‚Äîand these describe him in terms of affection, but not as a paragon of poetic or moral ideals. Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry.

However, as Hung notes, he &quot;is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time&quot;, and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century. Early positive comments came from Bai Juyi, who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu&#x27;s works (although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems), and from Han Yu, who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li Bai on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them. Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work. By the beginning of the 10th century, Wei Zhuang constructed the first replica of his thatched cottage in Sichuan.

It was in the 11th century, during the Northern Song era that Du Fu&#x27;s reputation reached its peak. In this period a comprehensive re-evaluation of earlier poets took place, in which Wang Wei, Li Bai and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian strands of Chinese culture. At the same time, the development of Neo-Confucianism ensured that Du Fu, as its poetic exemplar, occupied the paramount position. Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was &quot;preeminent¬†... because¬†... through all his vicissitudes, he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign&quot;. His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites: political conservatives were attracted by his loyalty to the established order, while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor. Literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery, while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations. Since the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Du Fu&#x27;s loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism, and he has been praised for his use of simple, &quot;people&#x27;s language&quot;.

Du Fu&#x27;s popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England: it was hard for any Chinese poet &quot;not&quot; to be influenced by him. While there was never another Du Fu, individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work: Bai Juyi&#x27;s concern for the poor, Lu You&#x27;s patriotism, and Mei Yaochen&#x27;s reflections on the quotidian are a few examples. More broadly, Du Fu&#x27;s work in transforming the &quot;l«úshi&quot; from mere word play into &quot;a vehicle for serious poetic utterance&quot; set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre.

In its publishing of Burton Watson&#x27;s translation of Du Fu&#x27;s poems, the Columbia University Press commented that Du Fu &quot;has been called China&#x27;s greatest poet, and some call him the greatest nonepic, nondramatic poet whose writings survive in any language.&quot;

=== Influence on Japanese literature ===
Du Fu&#x27;s poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature, especially on the literature from the Muromachi period and on scholars and poets in the Edo period, including Matsuo Bash≈ç, the very greatest of all haiku poets. Even in modern Japanese, the term is mostly synonymous with Du Fu.

Until the 13th century, the Japanese preferred Bai Juyi above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu, although his influence can be seen in some kanshi (&quot;Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets&quot;) anthologies such as &quot;Bunka Sh≈´reish≈´&quot; in the 9th century. The first notable Japanese appreciator of Du Fu&#x27;s poetry was Kokan Shiren (1278‚Äì1346), a Rinzai Zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol. 11 of &quot;Saihokush≈´&quot;. His student Ch≈´gan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated to be &quot;influenced by Du Fu&quot; in their prefaces. Ch≈´gan&#x27;s student Gid≈ç Sh≈´shin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu&#x27;s poetry in the mundane world; one day Nij≈ç Yoshimoto, the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry, asked Gid≈ç, &quot;Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai?&quot; Gid≈ç dared to reply, &quot;Yes if you do have enough capability. No if do not.&quot; Since then, there had been many seminars on Du Fu&#x27;s poetry both in Zen temples and in the aristocratic society, and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Muromachi period, e.g., &quot;Taiheiki&quot;, a historical epic in the late 14th century, and some noh plays such as &quot;Hyakuman&quot;, &quot;Bash≈ç&quot;, and &quot;Shunkan&quot;.

During the Kan&#x27;ei era of the Edo period (1624‚Äì1643), &quot;Sh√†o Chu√°n&quot; () of the Ming Dynasty&#x27;s was imported into Japan, and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and ch≈çnin (townspeople) class. The commentary established Du Fu&#x27;s fame as the highest of all poets; for instance, Hayashi Shunsai, a notable Confucian scholar, commented in Vol. 37 of &quot;Gah≈ç Bunsh≈´&quot; that Z«êmƒõi [Du Fu] was the very best poet in history and praised Sh√†o Chu√°n&#x27;s commentary for its simplicity and readability, while he criticised old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty as too unfathomable. Matsuo Bash≈ç, the greatest haiku poet, was also strongly influenced by Du Fu; in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, his masterpiece, he cites the first two lines of &quot;A Spring View&quot; () before a haiku as its introduction and also many of his other haiku have similar wording and themes. It is said that when he died in Osaka during a long travel, a copy of Du Fu&#x27;s poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around.

== Translation ==
A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu&#x27;s work into English. As Burton Watson remarks in &quot;The Selected Poems of Du Fu&quot;, &quot;There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu, which is why we need as many different translations as possible&quot; (p. xxii). The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear (particularly when translating regulated verse, or &quot;l«úshi&quot;), and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works (Hawkes writes that &quot;his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation&quot;‚Äîp. ix).

One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rexroth&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Poems From the Chinese&quot;. His are free translations, which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content; his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection, and secondly to &quot;translate out&quot; the references in those works which he does select. Other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in &quot;Three Chinese Poets&quot; uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in &quot;Facing the Moon&quot; approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and preserve some degree of parallelism. In &quot;The Selected Poems of Du Fu&quot;, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation. Arthur Cooper also translated selected poems of Du Fu and Li Bai, which were published under the Penguin Classics imprint. David Hinton has also published selected poems for New Directions, first in 1989 followed by an expanded and revised edition in 2020. In 2015, Stephen Owen published annotated translations, with facing Chinese texts, of the complete poetry of Du Fu in six volumes.

<text>Creatine ( or ) is an organic compound with the nominal formula . It exists in various tautomers in solutions (among which are neutral form and various zwitterionic forms). Creatine is found in vertebrates, where it facilitates recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), primarily in muscle and brain tissue. Recycling is achieved by converting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP via donation of phosphate groups. Creatine also acts as a buffer.

==History==
Creatine was first identified in 1832 when Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul isolated it from the basified water-extract of skeletal muscle. He later named the crystallized precipitate after the Greek word for meat, (&quot;&quot;). In 1928, creatine was shown to exist in equilibrium with creatinine. Studies in the 1920s showed that consumption of large amounts of creatine did not result in its excretion. This result pointed to the ability of the body to store creatine, which in turn suggested its use as a dietary supplement.

In 1912, Harvard University researchers Otto Folin and Willey Glover Denis found evidence that ingesting creatine can dramatically boost the creatine content of the muscle. In the late 1920s, after finding that the intramuscular stores of creatine can be increased by ingesting creatine in larger than normal amounts, scientists discovered phosphocreatine (creatine phosphate), and determined that creatine is a key player in the metabolism of skeletal muscle. It is naturally formed in vertebrates.

The discovery of phosphocreatine was reported in 1927. In the 1960s, creatine kinase (CK) was shown to phosphorylate ADP using phosphocreatine (PCr) to generate ATP. It follows that ATP - not PCr - is directly consumed in muscle contraction. CK uses creatine to &quot;buffer&quot; the ATP/ADP ratio.

While creatine&#x27;s influence on physical performance has been well documented since the early twentieth century, it came into public view following the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. An August 7, 1992 article in &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Linford Christie, the gold medal winner at 100 meters, had used creatine before the Olympics (however, it should also be noted that Christie was found guilty of doping later in his career). An article in &quot;Bodybuilding Monthly&quot; named Sally Gunnell, who was the gold medalist in the 400-meter hurdles, as another creatine user. In addition, &quot;The Times&quot; also noted that 100 meter hurdler Colin Jackson began taking creatine before the Olympics.
At the time, low-potency creatine supplements were available in Britain, but creatine supplements designed for strength enhancement were not commercially available until 1993 when a company called Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS) introduced the compound to the sports nutrition market under the name &quot;Phosphagen&quot;. Research performed thereafter demonstrated that the consumption of high glycemic carbohydrates in conjunction with creatine increases creatine muscle stores.

==Metabolic role==
Creatine is a naturally occurring non-protein compound and the primary constituent of phosphocreatine, which is used to regenerate ATP within the cell. 95% of the human body&#x27;s total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle, while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, testes, and other tissues. The typical creatine content of skeletal muscle (as both creatine and phosphocreatine) is 120¬†mmol per kilogram of dry muscle mass, but can reach up to 160¬†mmol/kg through supplementation. Approximately 1‚Äì2% of intramuscular creatine is degraded per day and an individual would need about 1‚Äì3 grams of creatine per day to maintain average (unsupplemented) creatine storage. An omnivorous diet provides roughly half of this value, with the remainder synthesized in the liver and kidneys.

Creatine is not an essential nutrient. It is an amino acid derivative, naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids glycine and arginine, with an additional requirement for &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine (a derivative of methionine) to catalyze the transformation of guanidinoacetate to creatine. In the first step of the biosynthesis, the enzyme (AGAT, EC:2.1.4.1) mediates the reaction of glycine and arginine to form guanidinoacetate. This product is then methylated by guanidinoacetate &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (GAMT, EC:2.1.1.2), using &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor. Creatine itself can be phosphorylated by creatine kinase to form phosphocreatine, which is used as an energy buffer in skeletal muscles and the brain. A cyclic form of creatine, called creatinine, exists in equilibrium with its tautomer and with creatine.

===Phosphocreatine system===

Creatine is transported through the blood and taken up by tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and skeletal muscle, through an active transport system. The concentration of ATP in skeletal muscle is usually 2‚Äì5¬†mM, which would result in a muscle contraction of only a few seconds. During times of increased energy demands, the phosphagen (or ATP/PCr) system rapidly resynthesizes ATP from ADP with the use of phosphocreatine (PCr) through a reversible reaction catalysed by the enzyme creatine kinase (CK). The phosphate group is attached to an NH center of the creatine. In skeletal muscle, PCr concentrations may reach 20‚Äì35¬†mM or more. Additionally, in most muscles, the ATP regeneration capacity of CK is very high and is therefore not a limiting factor. Although the cellular concentrations of ATP are small, changes are difficult to detect because ATP is continuously and efficiently replenished from the large pools of PCr and CK. A proposed representation has been illustrated by Krieder et al. Creatine has the ability to increase muscle stores of PCr, potentially increasing the muscle&#x27;s ability to resynthesize ATP from ADP to meet increased energy demands.

Creatine supplementation appears to increase the number of myonuclei that satellite cells will &#x27;donate&#x27; to damaged muscle fibers, which increases the potential for growth of those fibers. This increase in myonuclei probably stems from creatine&#x27;s ability to increase levels of the myogenic transcription factor MRF4.

===Genetic deficiencies===
Genetic deficiencies in the creatine biosynthetic pathway lead to various severe neurological defects. Clinically, there are three distinct disorders of creatine metabolism, termed cerebral creatine deficiencies. Deficiencies in the two synthesis enzymes can cause caused by variants in &quot;GATM&quot; and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, caused by variants in &quot;GAMT&quot;. Both biosynthetic defects are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A third defect, creatine transporter defect, is caused by mutations in &quot;SLC6A8&quot; and is inherited in a X-linked manner. This condition is related to the transport of creatine into the brain.

===Vegans and vegetarians===
Vegan and vegetarian diets are associated with lower levels of muscle creatine, and athletes on these diets may benefit from creatine supplementation.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Most of the research to-date on creatine has predominantly focused on the pharmacological properties of creatine, yet there is a lack of research into the pharmacokinetics of creatine. Studies have not established pharmacokinetic parameters for clinical usage of creatine such as volume of distribution, clearance, bioavailability, mean residence time, absorption rate, and half life. A clear pharmacokinetic profile would need to be established prior to optimal clinical dosing.

=== Dosing ===

==== Loading phase ====

An approximation of 0.3 g/kg/day divided into 4 equal spaced intervals has been suggested since creatine needs may vary based on body weight. It has also been shown that taking a lower dose of 3 grams a day for 28 days can also increase total muscle creatine storage to the same amount as the rapid loading dose of 20 g/day for 6 days. However, a 28-day loading phase does not allow for ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation to be realized until fully saturated muscle storage.

This elevation in muscle creatine storage has been correlated with ergogenic benefits discussed in the research section. However, higher doses for longer periods of time are being studied to offset creatine synthesis deficiencies and mitigating diseases.

==== Maintenance phase ====
After the 5‚Äì7 day loading phase, muscle creatine stores are fully saturated and supplementation only needs to cover the amount of creatine broken down per day. This maintenance dose was originally reported to be around 2‚Äì3 g/day (or 0.03 g/kg/day), however, some studies have suggested 3‚Äì5 g/day maintenance dose to maintain saturated muscle creatine.

=== Absorption ===

Endogenous serum or plasma creatine concentrations in healthy adults are normally in a range of 2‚Äì12¬†mg/L. A single 5 gram (5000¬†mg) oral dose in healthy adults results in a peak plasma creatine level of approximately 120¬†mg/L at 1‚Äì2 hours post-ingestion. Creatine has a fairly short elimination half life, averaging just less than 3 hours, so to maintain an elevated plasma level it would be necessary to take small oral doses every 3‚Äì6 hours throughout the day.

==Exercise and sport==
Creatine supplements are marketed in ethyl ester, gluconate, monohydrate, and nitrate forms.

Creatine supplementation for sporting performance enhancement is considered safe for short-term use but there is a lack of safety data for long term use, or for use in children and adolescents. Some athletes choose to cycle on and off creatine.

A 2018 review article in the &quot;Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition&quot; said that creatine monohydrate might help with energy availability for high-intensity exercise.

Creatine use can increase maximum power and performance in high-intensity anaerobic repetitive work (periods of work and rest) by 5% to 15%. Creatine has no significant effect on aerobic endurance, though it will increase power during short sessions of high-intensity aerobic exercise. 

Creatine is proven to boost the recovery and work capacity of an athlete, and multi-applicable capabilities upon athletes have given it a lot of interest over the course of the past decade. A survey of 21,000 college athletes showed that 14% of athletes take creatine supplements to try to improve performance. Compared to normal athletes, those with creatine supplementation have been shown to produce better athletic performance. Non-athletes report taking creatine supplements to improve appearance.

==Research ==

===Cognitive performance===
Creatine is sometimes reported to have a beneficial effect on brain function and cognitive processing, although the evidence is difficult to interpret systematically and the appropriate dosing is unknown. The greatest effect appears to be in individuals who are stressed (due, for instance, to sleep deprivation) or cognitively impaired.

A 2018 systematic review found that &quot;generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration&quot;, whereas for other cognitive domains &quot;the results were conflicting&quot;. Another 2023 review initially found evidence of improved memory function. However, it was later determined that faulty statistics lead to the statistical significance and after fixing the &quot;double counting&quot;, the effect was only significant in older adults.

A 2023 review study &quot;...supported claims that creatine supplementation can increases [sic] brain creatine content but also demonstrated somewhat equivocal results for effects on cognition. It does, however, provide evidence to suggest that more research is required with stressed populations, as supplementation does appear to significantly affect brain content.

===Muscular disease===
A meta-analysis found that creatine treatment increased muscle strength in muscular dystrophies, and potentially improved functional performance. Creatine treatment does not appear to improve muscle strength in people who have metabolic myopathies. High doses of creatine lead to increased muscle pain and an impairment in activities of daily living when taken by people who have McArdle disease.

According to a clinical study focusing on people with various muscular dystrophies, using a pure form of creatine monohydrate can be beneficial in rehabilitation after injuries and immobilization.

===Mitochondrial diseases===
====Parkinson&#x27;s disease====
Creatine&#x27;s impact on mitochondrial function has led to research on its efficacy and safety for slowing Parkinson&#x27;s disease. As of 2014, the evidence did not provide a reliable foundation for treatment decisions, due to risk of bias, small sample sizes, and the short duration of trials.

==== Huntington&#x27;s disease ====
Several primary studies have been completed but no systematic review on Huntington&#x27;s disease has been completed yet.

===ALS===
It is ineffective as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

===Testosterone===
A 2021 systemic review of studies found that &quot;the current body of evidence does not indicate that creatine supplementation increases total testosterone, free testosterone, DHT or causes hair loss/baldness&quot;.

==Adverse effects==
Side effects include:

* Weight gain due to extra water retention to the muscle
* Potential muscle cramps / strains / pulls
* Upset stomach
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness

One well-documented effect of creatine supplementation is weight gain within the first week of the supplement schedule, likely attributable to greater water retention due to the increased muscle creatine concentrations by means of osmosis.

A 2009 systematic review discredited concerns that creatine supplementation could affect hydration status and heat tolerance and lead to muscle cramping and diarrhea.

Despite weight gain due to water retention and potential cramps being two seemingly &quot;common&quot; side effects, new research indicates that these side effects are likely not the result of creatine usage. In addition, the initial water retention is attributed to more short-term creatine use (the &quot;loading&quot; phase). Studies have shown that creatine usage does not necessarily affect total body water relative to muscle mass in the long-term.

=== Renal function ===
A 2019 systematic review published by the National Kidney Foundation investigated whether creatine supplementation had adverse effects on renal function. They identified 15 studies from 1997 to 2013 that looked at standard creatine loading and maintenance protocols of 4‚Äì20 g/day of creatine versus placebo. They utilized serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and serum urea levels as a measure of renal damage. While in general creatine supplementation resulted in slightly elevated creatinine levels that remained within normal limits, supplementation did not induce renal damage (P value&lt; 0.001). Special populations included in the 2019 Systematic review included type 2 diabetic patients and post-menopausal women, bodybuilders, athletes, and resistance trained populations. The study also discussed 3 case studies where there were reports that creatine affected renal function.

In a joint statement between the American College of Sports Medicine, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and Dietitians in Canada on performance enhancing nutrition strategies, creatine was included in their list of ergogenic aids and they do not list renal function as a concern for use.

The most recent position stand on creatine from the &quot;Journal of International Society of Sports Nutrition&quot; states that creatine is safe to take in healthy populations from infants to the elderly to performance athletes. They also state that long term (5 years) use of creatine has been considered safe.

It is important to mention that kidneys themselves, for normal physiological function, need phosphocreatine and creatine and indeed kidneys express significant amounts of creatine kinases (BB-CK and u-mtCK isoenzymes). At the same time, the first of two steps for endogenous creatine synthesis takes place in the kidneys themselves. Patients with kidney disease and those undergoing dialysis treatment generally show significantly lower levels of creatine in their organs, since the pathological kidneys are both hampered in creatine synthesis capability and are in back-resorption of creatine from the urine in the distal tubules. In addition, dialysis patients lose creatine due to wash out by the dialysis treatment itself and thus become chronically creatine depleted. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that dialysis patients generally consume less meat and fish, the alimentary sources of creatine. Therefore, to alleviate chronic creatine depletion in these patients and allow organs to replenish their stores of creatine, it was proposed in a 2017 article in &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot; to supplement dialysis patients with extra creatine, preferably by intra-dialytic administration. Such a supplementation with creatine in dialysis patients is expected to significantly improve the health and quality of the patients by improving muscle strength, coordination of movement, brain function and to alleviate depression and chronic fatigue that are common in these patients.

==Safety==
===Contamination===

A 2011 survey of 33 supplements commercially available in Italy found that over 50% of them exceeded the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in at least one contaminant. The most prevalent of these contaminants was creatinine, a breakdown product of creatine also produced by the body. Creatinine was present in higher concentrations than the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in 44% of the samples. About 15% of the samples had detectable levels of dihydro-1,3,5-triazine or a high dicyandiamide concentration. Heavy metals contamination was not found to be a concern, with only minor levels of mercury being detectable. Two studies reviewed in 2007 found no impurities.

=== Food and cooking ===
When creatine is mixed with protein and sugar at high temperatures (above 148¬†¬∞C), the resulting reaction produces carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs). Such a reaction happens when grilling or pan-frying meat. Creatine content (as a percentage of crude protein) can be used as an indicator of meat quality.

== Dietary considerations ==
Creatine-monohydrate is suitable for vegetarians and vegans, as the raw materials used for the production of the supplement have no animal origin.

<text>Calico is a ghost town and former mining town in San Bernardino County, California, United States. Located in the Calico Mountains of the Mojave Desert region of Southern California, it was founded in 1881 as a silver mining town, and was later converted into a county park named &quot;Calico Ghost Town&quot;. Located off Interstate 15, it lies equidistant from Barstow and Yermo. Giant letters spelling &quot;CALICO&quot; are visible, from the highway, on the Calico Peaks behind it. Walter Knott purchased Calico in the 1950s, and rebuilt all but the five remaining original buildings to look as they did in the 1880s. Calico received California Historical Landmark #782, and in 2005 was proclaimed by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to be California&#x27;s Silver Rush Ghost Town.

==History==
In 1881, four prospectors were leaving Grapevine Station (present-day Barstow, California) for a mountain peak to the northeast. After they described the peak as &quot;calico-colored&quot;, the peak, the mountain range to which it belonged, and the town that followed were all called Calico. The four prospectors discovered silver in the mountain and opened the Silver King Mine, which was California&#x27;s largest silver producer in the mid-1880s. John C. King, who had grubstaked the prospectors who discovered the silver vein (the Silver King Mine was thus named after him), was the uncle of Walter Knott founder of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. King was sheriff of San Bernardino County from 1879 to 1882. A post office at Calico was established in early 1882, and the Calico Print, a weekly newspaper, started publishing. The town soon supported three hotels, five general stores, a meat market, bars, brothels, and three restaurants and boarding houses. The county established a school district and a voting precinct. The town also had a deputy sheriff and two constables, two lawyers and a justice of the peace, five commissioners, and two doctors. There was also a Wells Fargo office and a telephone and telegraph service. At the height of its silver production during 1883 and 1885, Calico had over 500 mines and a population of 1,200 people. Local badmen were buried in the Boot Hill cemetery.

The discovery of the borate mineral colemanite in the Calico mountains a few years after the settlement of the town also helped Calico&#x27;s fortunes, and in 1890 the estimated population of the town was 3,500, with nationals of China, England, Ireland, Greece, France, and the Netherlands, as well as Americans living there. In the same year, the Silver Purchase Act was enacted and drove down the price of silver. By 1896, its value had decreased to $0.57 (~$ in ) per troy ounce, and Calico&#x27;s silver mines were no longer economically viable. The post office was discontinued in 1898, and the school closed not long after. By the turn of the twentieth century, Calico was all but a ghost town, and with the end of borax mining in the region in 1907 the town was largely abandoned. Many of the original buildings were moved to Barstow, Daggett and Yermo.
An attempt to revive the town was made , when a cyanide plant was built to recover silver from the unprocessed Silver King Mine&#x27;s deposits. Walter Knott and his wife Cordelia, founders of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, were homesteaded at Newberry Springs around this time, and Knott helped build the redwood cyanide tanks for the plant.

The last owner of Calico as a mine was Zenda Mining Company. After building Ghost Town at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm in the 1940s, Walter Knott, his son, Russell, and Paul von Klieben, who was Knott&#x27;s art director, made a road trip to Calico. The three of them came back filled with enthusiasm. Now having experience building a fictional ghost town at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, the group believed that it would be possible to restore a real ghost town. In 1951, Walter Knott purchased the town of Calico from the Zenda Mining Company and put Paul von Klieben in charge of restoring it to its original condition, referencing old photographs.

Using the old photos, and Walter&#x27;s memory and that of some old-timers who still lived in the area, von Klieben was able to not only restore existing structures, but also design and replace missing buildings. Knott spent $700,000 restoring Calico. Knott installed a longtime employee named Freddy &quot;Calico Fred&quot; Noller as resident caretaker and official greeter. In 1966 Walter Knott decided to donate the town to San Bernardino County, and Calico became a County Regional Park.

==Current status==


Calico has been restored to the look of the silver rush era when it flourished, although many original buildings were removed and replaced instead with gingerbread architecture and false fa√ßades that tourists would expect to see in a Western-themed town. Most of the restored and newly built buildings are made of wood with a simple, rustic architecture and a severely weathered appearance. Some structures still stand dating back to the town&#x27;s operational years: Lil&#x27;s Saloon; the town office; the former home of Lucy Lane, which is now the main museum but was originally the town&#x27;s post office and courthouse; Smitty&#x27;s Gallery; the general store; and Joe&#x27;s Saloon. There is also a replica of the schoolhouse on the site of the original building. The one-time homes of the town&#x27;s Chinese citizens exist as ruins only; only a portion of one rock wall remains of the former &quot;family&quot; residential area on a nearby bluff.

In November 1962, Calico Ghost Town was registered as a California Historical Landmark (Landmark #782), In 2002, Calico vied with Bodie in Mono County to be recognized as the Official State Ghost Town. In 2005, a compromise was finally reached when the State Senate and State Assembly agreed to list Bodie as the Official State Gold Rush Ghost Town and Calico as the Official State Silver Rush Ghost Town.

Today, the park operates mine tours, gunfight stunt shows, gold panning, several restaurants, the historic narrow-gauge Calico &amp; Odessa Railroad, a Mystery Shack, and a number of trinket stores. It is open every day except Christmas and requires an entrance fee. Additional fees are required for some attractions. Overnight camping is also available. Special events are held throughout the year, including the Civil War Days Historical Reenactment on President&#x27;s Day weekend, Spring Festival in May, Calico Days in early October, and a Ghost Town haunt in late October.

The Calico Cemetery, which holds between 96 and 130 graves, has had burials in the 20th and 21st centuries.

<doc id="331233" wikidata="Q734425" url="?curid=331233" title="Eamonn Coghlan">
<text>Eamonn Christopher Coghlan (born 21 November 1952) is an Irish former track and field athlete who specialised in middle distance track events and the 5,000 metres. He is a three-time Olympian, held the world indoor mile record and was world champion in the 5,000¬†m. Coghlan served as a senator from 2011 to 2016.

Born in Drimnagh, he had a successful amateur running career in Ireland that led to a scholarship in the United States, where he won four NCAA titles in track running and ran a sub-four-minute mile to set an Irish record at 22 years of age. He soon set the European record over the distance. His speciality was the indoor mile run ‚Äì he gained his nickname, &quot;The Chairman of the Boards&quot;, as a result of his great success on the US indoor circuit. He broke the indoor mile world record on three occasions and also set a world indoor record over 2,000¬†m.

He finished fourth in the 1500 Metres at the 1976 Summer Olympics, fourth again in the 5,000¬†m at the 1980 Summer Olympics and made the 5,000¬†m semi-final in his last Olympic appearance at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He experienced greater success in the 1,500¬†m at the European Athletics Championships: he won the 1,500¬†m at the 1979 European Athletics Indoor Championships and outdoors took silver in the event at the 1978 European Athletics Championships. He was also the 5,000¬†m champion at the IAAF World Cup in 1981 and he became the world 5,000 metres champion at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics.

After competitive retirement, he continued to race and became the first man over 40 years old to run a sub-four-minute mile. He has appeared as a panellist on Irish broadcaster RT√â and released his autobiography, &quot;Chairman of the Boards, Master of the Mile&quot;, in 2008.

In May 2011, Coghlan was appointed as a Senator by the Taoiseach Enda Kenny.

==Early life==
Coghlan was born in Drimnagh, Dublin, Republic of Ireland, and educated at St. Vincent&#x27;s C.B.S., Glasnevin. He lived in Rye, New York for a number of years in the 1980s before returning to live in Ireland. He was a childhood friend of Brian Kerr, who went on to manage the Ireland national football team.

Coghlan&#x27;s first running club was the Celtic Athletic Club. He then joined Donore Harriers. After the Moscow Olympics in 1980, he moved to Metropolitan Harriers where he was coached by Gerry Farnan. He won the Leinster colleges cross country championships &amp; the 5000m track title in 1970. The following year he won the All-Ireland 1500 metres and 5000 metres titles. In 1971 he was offered a scholarship by Villanova University. The famous running coach James &#x27;Jumbo&#x27; Elliott invited Coghlan to train for the Villanova track and field team. While there he won four NCAA individual titles over 1500 meters and the mile. On 10 May 1975 Coghlan ran his first sub-4-minute mile in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (3:56.2). One week later, on 17 May, he broke the long-standing European Outdoor Mile record of Michel Jazy, in a time of 3:53.3 in Kingston, Jamaica. He graduated from Villanova University, Pennsylvania, USA in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing and Communications.

==Personal life==
He and his wife, Yvonne, have four children. His youngest son, John, is one of Ireland&#x27;s leading athletes who won a team gold medal in the European Cross Country Championships in Portugal in 2010. His eldest son, Eamonn, is a golf professional at Hearthstone Country Club, Houston, Texas.

== Career ==

=== Indoor career ===

Coghlan was nicknamed &quot;The Chairman of the Boards&quot; because of his success on indoor tracks. He won 52 of his 70 races at 1,500 m and 1 Mile from 1974 to 1987. He set the world record for the indoor mile run with a time of 3.52.6 at the San Diego Sports Arena in San Diego in 1979. He lowered this to 3:50.6 in 1981 and then bettered it to 3:49.78 in 1983 at New Jersey&#x27;s Meadowlands Arena indoor arena. His record stood until 1997 when it was broken by Morocco&#x27;s Hicham El Guerrouj in a time of 3:48.45. It stood as the Irish record until 2025, when Andrew Coscoran set a new record of 3:49.26. Coghlan&#x27;s 1983 time was the fastest mile ever run in the United States until 10 June 2007, when Daniel Kipchirchir Komen ran 3:48.28 outdoors in Eugene, Oregon. It remains one of only four sub-3:50 miles run on American soil. By and large, Coghlan was more successful at indoor running notwithstanding a later world title in 1983 over 5,000 meters.

Coghlan also set the record for the indoor 2,000 meter run at 4:54.07 in 1987, which stood until Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia ran 4:52.86 in 1998 (which was broken in 2007 when Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia ran 4:49.99). Coghlan won the world-famous Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games in NYC&#x27;s Madison Square Garden a record seven times (1977, 1979‚Äì81, 1983, 1985, 1987) his last win being at the age of 34. His record stood for over twenty years with Bernard Lagat winning for an eighth time in 2010: Coghlan fired the starting pistol to the record-breaking race and presented Lagat with a trophy.

=== Outdoor career ===
He won the 5,000 metres at the 1983 World Championships to follow two fourth places in the Olympics (in the 1,500 meters in 1976 and the 5,000 meters in 1980).

In the 1976 Olympics, he probably made a mistake by taking the lead at 500 metres and by not accelerating enough before the winner, John Walker, passed him at 1,200 metres. Thus he lost valuable energy which he would have needed in the home straight&#x27;s struggle against Walker, Belgium&#x27;s Ivo van Damme and West Germany&#x27;s Paul-Heinz Wellman. In the 1980 Olympics 5,000 metres he probably made a mistake by sprinting to the lead at the start of the last back straight.

In any case, he led the race for only a few seconds before Ethiopia&#x27;s Miruts Yifter kicked past him on the inside. By contrast, in the 1983 World Championships in Athletics 5,000 metres, Coghlan was in peak shape and ran intelligently, catching the Soviet Union&#x27;s Dmitry Dmitriyev on the last back straight and sprinting past him with about 120 metres to go. He ran the last 1,000 metres very fast, in 2:24.77, and won the race by 1.67 seconds, despite clearly slowing down in the final metres. He also won silver at the 1978 European Championships in Prague over 1500m, in 3:36.57, behind Steve Ovett of Great Britain, and in 1979, he competed in his only European Indoor Championships (he raced sparingly on the European indoor circuit due to his indoor commitments in the US), taking the gold medal in the 1500 m in Vienna. In December 1979 he ran the only sub 50-minute time in the Waterhouse Byrne Baird Shield 10 Mile Cross Country. In 1981, Eamonn won the gold medal at 5000m in the IAAF World Cup, competing for Europe (not shown in the medal table above). He missed out on the 1982 European Championships and the 1984 Olympic Games due to injury. Coghlan was eliminated in the 5000-metre semi-finals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics In 1985, he was a member of Ireland&#x27;s four-man squad along with Marcus O&#x27;Sullivan, Frank O&#x27;Mara and Ray Flynn, which set a world record time of 15:49.08 in the 4 x mile relay, in a charity fund-raising race in Dublin.

In total, Coghlan ran 83 sub-4-minute miles, indoor and out.

==Life after retirement==
In 1994, on the Harvard University indoor track, Eamonn became the first man over age 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile. He was 41 at the time. Coghlan ran the sub-four-minute mile as a &quot;Special Attraction&quot; during the middle of the Massachusetts State High School Championship meet. Athletes surrounded the banked track clapping and pounding out the rhythm of :59 sec. splits on the fast Harvard track.

Coghlan works as director of fundraising (North America) for the Children&#x27;s Medical &amp; Research Foundation, Our Lady&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital, Dublin and is a regular panellist on Ireland&#x27;s television station RT√â for athletics programmes. He coaches a number of Irish international runners including David Campbell, David Fitzmaurice and his son John.

In 2002, he appeared in part two of the original &quot;Mrs Browns Boys&quot; series.

In 2008, he served as Grand Marshal for Dublin&#x27;s St Patrick&#x27;s Day parade.

Coghlan&#x27;s book &quot;Chairman of the Boards, Master of the Mile&quot; was released in 2008.

==Political career==
In May 2011, he was appointed as a Senator by the Taoiseach Enda Kenny. He sat as an independent until 7 February 2012, when he joined the Fine Gael party.

He ran as the Fine Gael candidate in the 2014 Dublin West by-election. During an election debate on Tonight with Vincent Browne, he baffled viewers and panel members by telling a bizarre anecdote, including an impersonation, about a constituent he had met during his canvass. His campaign largely &quot;fell flat on its face&quot; according to a Fine Gael minister, despite the party putting significant resources into the constituency He polled 3,788 first preference votes, placing fifth in the contest and being eliminated on the fourth count. This was a 1.9% drop in the Fine Gael vote, compared to the previous by-election result in the same constituency.

He unsuccessfully ran for election to the Administrative Panel of the Seanad in 2016, getting 3% of first preference votes, and was not re-nominated to the Seanad.

<text>Pharamond, also spelled Faramund, is a legendary early king of the Franks, first referred to in the anonymous 8th-century &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, which depicts him as the first king of the Franks.

==Historical sources and scholarship==

Pharamond first appears in the &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, commonly dated to 727. After relating the legendary Trojan origin of the Franks (which is copied in main from the Chronicle of Fredegar), the &quot;Liber&quot; reports that after the death of the Frankish leader Sunno, his brother Marcomer proposed to the Franks that they should have one single king, contrary to their tradition. The &quot;Liber&quot; adds that Pharamond, named as Marcomer&#x27;s son, was chosen as &quot;long-haired&quot; (&quot;crinitus&quot;) king. When he died, his son Chlodio was raised up as the next king.

Because there is no reference to Pharamond in any source prior to this work, scholars generally consider him a legendary rather than historical figure. In contrast to his depiction as a sole king, several sources, for example Gregory of Tours, attest multiple Frankish rulers in his time (that is, before ca. 428). The first king to unite all Franks was actually Clovis I. According to Rosamond McKitterick, the emphasis of the &quot;Liber&quot; was upon &quot;construct[ing] a specific past for a particular group of people.&quot;

As first king of the Franks, Pharamond was also associated with establishing the Salic law, as noted, for example in the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; (c.1100), chapter 8.

Later sources, such as the universal chronicle of Sigebert of Gembloux, list Pharamond as King of the Franks between Marcomer and Chlodio:
==In literature==

A Pharamond appears as the king of France in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; and later Arthurian works.

In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, Pharamond is mentioned as the originator of the Salic law, especially its banning women from succession to the throne of France.

He appears as the title character in the opera &quot;Faramondo&quot; by George Frideric Handel.

A character named Pharamond appears in the &quot;Sandman&quot; and &quot;Lucifer&quot; comics series.

Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; mentions Pharamond after Jehan Frollo&#x27;s arrow pierces the left arm of Quasimodo the hunchback: &quot;This no more disturbed Quasimodo than a scratch would have bothered King Pharamond.&quot; (Cobb translation)

Faramund is the faction leader of the Franks and a playable character in the PC video game &quot;Total War: Attila&quot; when beginning a Grand Campaign, with a begin date of 395 AD. He is the son of the former deceased faction leader Marcomer.

A descendant of the French kings, named Pharamond after his ancestor (&quot;first king of France&quot;), is the main character in Jean Raspail&#x27;s novel &quot;Sire.&quot;

<doc id="331239" wikidata="Q211165" url="?curid=331239" title="Asiana Airlines">
<text>Asiana Airlines Inc. ( ) is a South Korean airline headquartered in Seoul. The airline operates 90 international passenger routes, 14 domestic passenger routes and 27 cargo routes throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. In 2019, it accounted for 25% of South Korea&#x27;s international aviation market and 20% of its domestic market. It maintains its international hub at Incheon International Airport and its domestic hub at Gimpo International Airport, both in Seoul.

Asiana Airlines is a full-service airline member of Star Alliance with two subsidiary low-cost carriers Air Busan and Air Seoul. It is the largest shareholder of Air Busan, a regional carrier that the airline established as joint venture with Busan Metropolitan City. The airline also operates Air Seoul, a wholly-owned subsidiary.

==History==
===Founding===
Korean Air, which was acquired by Hanjin Transportation in 1969, had a monopoly on the South Korean airline industry until the establishment of Asiana in 1988. Asiana&#x27;s formation did not come about as a policy initiative favoring liberalized market conditions, but rather because of pressure from other &quot;chaebols&quot; and interests that wanted to compete. It was formed by the Kumho Asiana Group (formerly Kumho Group) and was originally known as Seoul Air International. Asiana was established on 17 February 1988 and started operations in December 1988 with flights to Busan. As of 2007, the airline was owned by domestic private investors (30.53%), Kumho Industrial (29.51%), Kumho Petrochemical (15.05%), foreign investors (11.9%), Korea Development Bank (7.18%), and others (5.83%).

===Beginning regular service===
Asiana began operations in December 1988, using Boeing 737 Classic aircraft, with flights to Busan and Gwangju. In 1989, Asiana began regular services to Jeju City, Gwangju, and Daegu, and later the same year, began international chartered flights to Sendai in Japan. In 1990, Asiana began its first scheduled international services, to the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka. In the same year, Asiana had nine Boeing 747-400s, 20 Boeing 767-300s, and eight Boeing 737-400s. In early 1991, Asiana began services to Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taipei. Transpacific flights to Los Angeles began in December 1991 with a Boeing 747-400 Combi. Services to Vienna, Brussels, and Honolulu began in the mid-1990s. In 1993, Asiana began services in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.

===Expansion as a global carrier and joining Star Alliance===
Asiana Airlines has rapidly expanded since its establishment in 1988 to become a mid-sized global carrier with a fleet of 85 aircraft. In December 1998, the airline operated an aircraft on behalf of the president of South Korea for the first time. The airline was listed in KOSDAQ In December 1999. On 28 January 2003, the airline became a full Star Alliance member, expanding its worldwide network and global brand. In 2004, the airline added Airbus A330s and the Boeing 777-200ERs to its fleet and expanded its routes into mainland China. Currently, it provides international services to 71 cities in 23 countries on 91 routes and domestic services to 12 cities on 14 routes. It also provides international cargo services to 29 cities in 14 countries on 28 routes by Asiana Cargo, the airline&#x27;s freight division. In 2012, the airline had net sales of US$5.3 billion.

===New corporate identity===
In February 2006, Asiana Airlines modernized its corporate identity for unification with those of other divisions of its parent company the Kumho Asiana Group. The names of the travel classes have changed from first, business, and economy classes to first, business, and travel classes, respectively, and the colors of the travel classes have changed to yellow, blue, and red for first, business, and travel, respectively. New uniforms were also created for the crew.

===Financial crisis===
In April 2019, Asiana Airlines&#x27; parent company, Kumho Asiana Group, announced its plan to sell Asiana Airlines as a solution to its financial crisis.

The sale of Asiana Airlines began in July 2019. In June 2019, Aekyung Group, the parent company of Korean low-cost carrier Jeju Air, was considered as a strong candidate to take over. Korean Air&#x27;s parent company, Hanjin Group, and SK Group also considered purchasing.

Asiana Airlines discontinued unprofitable routes throughout July 2019 to October 2019, including Seoul‚ÄìIncheon to Chicago‚ÄìO&#x27;Hare, Delhi, Khabarovsk and Sakhalinsk.

On 25 July 2019, Kumho Asiana Group, the parent company of Asiana Airlines, officially announced its intention to sell Asiana Airlines for an estimated price of 1.5 to 2.0 trillion won (US$1.26 to 1.68 billion). Asiana Airlines includes subsidiaries Air Busan, Air Seoul, Asiana IDT and other subsidiary companies. AeKyeong Group, the parent company of Jeju Air, has expressed interest in acquiring Asiana Airlines.

On 4 September 2019, Aekyung Group, Mirae Asset Daewoo, and Korea Corporate Governance Improvement applied a letter of intent to acquire Asiana Airlines. On 12 November, a consortium of HDC Hyundai Development Company and Mirae Asset Daewoo was selected as the preferred bidder.

Asiana Airlines has chosen to retire older aircraft, including Boeing 747-400s and Boeing 767-300s, allowing the airline to reduce debt and weakness.

In July 2020, HDC Hyundai Development Company received approval from Russian authorities for its acquisition of Asiana Airlines. However, on 11 September 2020, Korea Development Bank, the primary creditor for Asiana Airlines, and Kumho Asiana Group officially canceled the merger with HDC Hyundai Development Company. Asiana Airlines will be run by creditors until a new owner is approved by the South Korean government.

===Merger with Korean Air===
On 16 November 2020, the Government of the Republic of Korea announced a policy of merging Asiana Airlines with Korean Air, which would acquire a 30.77% stake in Asiana from Korea Development Bank. The Korean state-run bank would invest 800 billion won (US$600 million) to Hanjin KAL, the holding company of Korean Air, to fund the merger. The two airlines would operate as separate brands until integration is complete. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport planned to integrate subsidiaries Air Busan, Air Seoul, and Jin Air into a new low-cost airline. The combined low-cost carrier will focus on regional airports within South Korea and flying regional Asia-Pacific routes.

=== 2021 ===

In March 2021, Korean Air announced it would delay the merger with Asiana Airlines due to a delay in antitrust approval from the government and six foreign authorities (China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, United States, and Vietnam). Korean Air will operate Asiana Airlines as a subsidiary for the next two years, after which it will combine its operation, IT, and other systems into a single system until 2024. Once the merger is complete, Asiana Airlines could become a member of SkyTeam. According to &quot;The Korea Times&quot;, only Turkey has approved the antitrust deal so far. 

On 30 June 2021, the post-merger plans between two airlines were reported to have been finalized and approved by Korea Development Bank. 

In August 2021, the Malaysian Aviation Commission approved the merger between Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, citing economic efficiencies and social benefits. 

On 16 November 2021, it was announced that Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam had approved Korean Air&#x27;s acquisition of smaller local rival Asiana Airlines Inc. 

=== 2022 ===

On 26 December 2022, the Ministry of Commerce of the People&#x27;s Republic of China announced its approval of Korean Air&#x27;s business combination with Asiana Airlines. 

=== 2023 ===

The U.S. Department of Justice blocked the deal in May 2023 citing monopoly concerns. In November 2023, Asiana agreed to divest its cargo business in an attempt to appease regulatory concerns.

=== 2024 === 

On 28 November 2024, European Commission approved the merger, followed by the approval from the United States on 2 December 2024. Following approval given from all 14 countries, Korean Air officially completed the acquisition of Asiana Airlines on 12 December 2024.

Korean Air Co. said August 7, 2024 it signed a tentative agreement valued at 470 billion won (US$341.7 million) to sell the cargo business division of Asiana Airlines Inc. to Air Incheon.

On 12 December 2024, Reuters reported that Korean Air has announced the completion of the purchase of the debt-laden Asiana Airlines in a deal worth 1.5 trillion won (US$1.6 billion). The deal enables Korean Air to acquire 63.88% in the second largest airline in the country, becoming the 12th largest airline in the world by international capacity.

=== 2024‚Äìpresent: After the merger, brand identity changes, and integration to Korean Air in 2026=== 

In December, Asiana Airlines quietly launched its new brand identity after the merger, which includes the removal the ‚Äúred arrow‚Äù elements (also branded as the Asiana Wings) of the previous owner Kumho Asiana Group and using the aircraft tail as a replacement. The Kumho Asiana Group logo on the fuselage has been removed and the red arrows on the all the passenger aircraft in the fleet have also been either removed or covered.

The brand identity of the two airlines will remain unchanged until Q4 2026 and in the meantime, several integration process will be conducted, including appointing a new CEO and key executives, as well as the integration of the low cost subsidiaries of both Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, including Jin Air, Air Busan and Air Seoul. Also, Asiana will end its 38 years of operation and will be integrated to Korean Air in 2026.

The third died in hospital a week after the incident as a result of her injuries. On 25 February 2014, Asiana Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. Department of Transportation for &quot;failing to promptly contact passengers&#x27; families and keep them informed about their loved ones&quot; during and after the crash.

<text>British European Airways (BEA), formally British European Airways Corporation, was a British airline which existed from 1946 until 1974.

BEA operated to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East from airports around the United Kingdom. The airline was also the largest UK domestic operator, serving major British cities, including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast, as well as areas of the British Isles such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. BEA also operated a network of internal German routes between West Berlin and West Germany as part of the Cold War agreements regulating air travel within Germany. The company slogan was &quot;Number One in Europe.&quot;

Formed as the British European Airways division of British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) on 1 January 1946, BEA became a crown corporation in its own right on 1 August 1946.

Operations commenced from Croydon and Northolt airports, with DH89A Dragon Rapides and Douglas DC-3s.

Having established its main operating base at Northolt, BEA operated its first service from Heathrow in April 1950; by late 1954, all Northolt operations had moved to Heathrow, which remained the airline&#x27;s main operating base until the merger with BOAC in 1974.

During 1952, BEA carried its millionth passenger, and by the early 1960s it had become the Western world&#x27;s fifth-biggest passenger-carrying airline and the biggest outside the United States.

In 1950, BEA operated the world&#x27;s first turbine-powered commercial air service with Vickers&#x27; Viscount 630 prototype, from London to Paris. The airline entered the jet age in 1960 with de Havilland&#x27;s DH106 Comet 4B. On 1 April 1964, it became the first to operate the DH121 Trident; on 10 June 1965, a BEA Trident 1C performed the world&#x27;s first automatic landing during a scheduled commercial air service.

For most of its existence, BEA was headquartered at &quot;BEAline House&quot; in Ruislip, London Borough of Hillingdon.

BEA ceased to exist as a separate legal entity on 1 April 1974 when the merger with BOAC to form British Airways (BA) took effect. The name was revived by British Airways from 1991 to 2008 when it changed the name of an existing subsidiary, &quot;British Airways Tour Operations Limited&quot; to &quot;British European Airways Limited&quot;. &quot;British Airways Tour Operations Limited&quot; was itself founded in 1935 as an air travel company, named &quot;Silver Wing Surface Arrangements Limited&quot;.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1946‚Äì1950)===
With the outbreak of war in September 1939 all commercial and private flying within the UK had been severely restricted by the government due to the possibility of civil flights encountering enemy aircraft. To offset this halting of civilian air traffic limited aerial services were instead carried out from 1940 onwards by the state-owned and operated British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) to a number of destinations, both European, and worldwide. On 1 January 1946, the Attlee government lifted wartime restrictions on civil flying in the United Kingdom. Within Europe, this resulted in BOAC resuming Imperial Airways&#x27; pre-war routes to continental Europe augmented by Royal Air Force Transport Command non-military flights from Croydon Airport, using Douglas Dakotas in RAF livery flown by crews in RAF uniforms, and UK domestic air services operated by the Associated Airways Joint Committee (AAJC), which had been formed of several pre-war charter companies on 27 June 1940.

BOAC formed a British European Airways division on 1 January 1946 in anticipation of that year&#x27;s Civil Aviation Act. Following its formation, BOAC&#x27;s new division began taking over Transport Command&#x27;s operations from 4 March 1946. On that day, it inaugurated a weekly Dakota service from Northolt to Madrid and Gibraltar, followed by additional Dakota services to Stavanger and Oslo, Copenhagen, as well as Athens via Marseille and Rome. On each of these flights, half of the Dakota&#x27;s 16 seats were reserved for UK government officials. Initially, crews continued to wear BOAC uniforms. Although some services still used Croydon for some time, the main operating base moved to RAF Northolt.

On 1 August 1946, the Civil Aviation Act 1946 was given Royal Assent and passed into law. This established BEA as a crown corporation in its own right (British European Airways &quot;Corporation&quot;) and transferred primary responsibility for scheduled air services from the UK to Europe (including the British Isles) to BEA. To fulfill its role as the new short- and medium-haul British flag carrier, BEA was organised into two divisions based at Northolt and Liverpool Speke respectively, with the former responsible for all scheduled services to the Continent and the latter for all scheduled services within the British Isles. The Civil Aviation Act 1946 furthermore provided for nationalisation of private, independent British scheduled airlines and gave BEA a legal monopoly as the sole short-haul scheduled British airline. Due to BEA&#x27;s inability to take over the UK domestic flights of independent scheduled operators such as Railway Air Services, Allied Airways (Gandar Dower) and British Channel Islands Airways on 1 August, these independents continued to ply their scheduled routes under contract to BEA until they were absorbed into the corporation in 1947.

The first flight operated by the newly constituted British European Airways Corporation departed Northolt for Marseille, Rome and Athens on the day of its formation at 8:40 am. This was followed by further route launches to Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon.

Initially, BEA supplemented its ex-RAF Transport Command Dakotas with Dragon Rapides and Avro Nineteens.

Between August and October 1946, BEA took delivery of the first 11 of an eventual 83 Vickers Viking piston-engined airliners. These were BEA&#x27;s first new aircraft, which it leased from the UK government. The first Viking revenue service departed Northolt for Copenhagen on 1 September 1946. Compared with the Dakota, the Viking took 35 minutes less to reach Copenhagen from London. Following their introduction on the London‚ÄìCopenhagen route, Vikings began replacing Dakotas on BEA&#x27;s services to Amsterdam, Oslo, Stockholm, Gibraltar and Prague.

In November 1946, BEA&#x27;s first service to Northern Ireland departed Croydon for Belfast (Sydenham) via Liverpool, using an ex-Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 52/3m operated by independent airline Railway Air Services on the fledgling corporation&#x27;s behalf. The following month, BEA&#x27;s Belfast operations transferred to Nutts Corner while Dakotas replaced the &quot;Jupiter&quot; class Ju 52s from 1947.

On 1 February 1947, the process of merging the wholly private, independent airlines operating in the UK under the AAJC umbrella into BEA began. Railway Air Services, Isle of Man Air Services, and Scottish Airways (which had been formed in 1937 by merging Northern &amp; Scottish Airways and Highland Airways) were among the first independents merged into the new corporation.

1947 was also the year BEA operated its first scheduled all-cargo flight from Northolt to Brussels with a DC-3 freighter. The same year, it inaugurated a scheduled service between Land&#x27;s End Airport in southwest Cornwall, England, and St Mary&#x27;s Airport on the largest island of the Isles of Scilly archipelago off the southwest coast of Cornwall, using &quot;Islander&quot; class Dragon Rapides.

Despite the previous year&#x27;s nationalisation of several private airlines and their absorption into BEA, the government-owned carrier continued to contract its private sector counterparts to operate a limited number of regional feeder services on its behalf via &quot;associate&quot; agreements. These needed to be approved by the Air Transport Advisory Council (ATAC), the contemporary UK government department in charge of air transport economic regulation. Cambrian and Western Airways were the first two airlines to be given associate status by BEA in May 1948. These arrangements enabled the latter to contract the operation of a new feeder route between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare to both of the former, which respectively used Dragon Rapides and Avro Ansons to provide a daily service. East Anglian Flying Services (EAFS) was another early BEA associate. The association agreement between BEA and EAFS resulted in the latter operating a Southend‚ÄìRochester feeder service on behalf of the former.

1948 was also the year BEA&#x27;s reservations department moved to new premises at Dorland Hall, Lower Regent Street in London&#x27;s West End.

BEA made aviation history in 1950 with the world&#x27;s first turbine-powered commercial air service from London to Paris, using the UK Ministry of Supply-owned Vickers Viscount 630 prototype G-AHRF. By that time, BEA&#x27;s main operating base at Northolt was the busiest airport in the UK; however, the airline was losing money, which resulted in replacing former BOAC director, Gerard d&#x27;Erlanger, who was BEA&#x27;s first chairman, with Lord Douglas of Kirtleside, as well as appointing Peter Masefield as its new managing director.

In April 1950, BEA operated its first service from London Heathrow Airport.

Following the provisional introduction of the Viscount 630 prototype on the London‚ÄìParis and London‚ÄìEdinburgh routes, BEA ordered 20 Viscount 701s in August 1950 for delivery from 1953. Also in 1950, BEA informed Vickers of its requirement for an aircraft with 10% lower costs per seat-mile than the 800 series Viscount. This provided the impetus for Vickers to begin developing the four-engined Vanguard high-capacity turboprop in 1953.

===Expansion, modernisation and commercialisation (1951‚Äì1960)===
Peter Masefield&#x27;s arrival as managing director (MD) in 1950 marked the beginning of BEA&#x27;s commercialisation. This entailed introduction of new cost control measures and innovative methods to boost revenue and passenger loads, including off-peak fares on late-evening flights and high-frequency services on the London‚ÄìParis route. BEA&#x27;s new commercially aggressive approach soon resulted in monthly earnings of ¬£1 million.

In early 1951, BEA introduced its first &quot;Pionair&quot; class Douglas DC-3, a Scottish Aviation DC-3 conversion featuring British instrumentation and an increased seating capacity of 32. In addition to having 38 DC-3s converted to Pionair passenger carriers, BEA had a further 10 DC-3s modified as &quot;Leopard&quot; class freighters. The same year, BEA introduced its first tourist class on Viking services. This entailed re-configuring a total of 49 aircraft in a 36-seat, single class layout. BEA referred to its re-configured, all-tourist class Vikings as &quot;Admiral&quot; class [aircraft].
In 1952, BEA carried its one-millionth passenger and introduced the first of 20 Airspeed Ambassadors. These cost ¬£3 million and featured a 49-seat mixed-class layout. BEA&#x27;s first commercial Ambassador service left London for Paris on 13 March 1952. Flights to Milan and Vienna began the following month. These aircraft introduced the airline&#x27;s passengers to new standards of comfort and speed. Compared with BEA&#x27;s older piston types, the Ambassador&#x27;s flight time from London to Milan, for example, reduced by two hours. In June 1952 BEA re-launched the pre-war mid-day &quot;Silverwing&quot; service pioneered by Imperial Airways on the London‚ÄìParis route with 40-seat all-first class Ambassadors. The Ambassador was BEA&#x27;s last major piston-engined type. It referred to the aircraft as &quot;Elizabethan&quot; class to commemorate the accession of Elizabeth II that year. Also in 1952, BEA made Jersey-based independent airline Jersey Airlines an associate to develop a network of routes within the Channel Islands and expand services between the islands and the UK mainland.

In 1953, BEA began receiving the first 16 Viscount 701 turboprops it had ordered in August 1950. The first of these &quot;Discovery&quot; class aircraft entered service with 47 mixed-class seats in April 1953, and the first production aircraft (G-AMAV) went on to win the transport class of the 1953 London to Christchurch, New Zealand, air race, with BEA MD Peter Masefield as team manager and co-pilot.

1953 was also the year &quot;Flightmaster&quot;, BEA&#x27;s first mechanical reservations system, was installed. This enabled the simultaneous display of seat availability on 32,000 flights.

Between February and April 1954, BEA&#x27;s expanding Viscount fleet replaced Elizabethans between London, Nice and Rome, and on regional routes from Manchester and Birmingham. By that time, BEA had shifted its main operating base to Heathrow, which became the London terminal for all international flights. Although it continued to use Northolt as a London terminal for domestic flights serving Manchester, Edinburgh, Renfrew (Glasgow), Aberdeen, Belfast and the Channel Islands which by that time were mainly operated by 36-seater &quot;Admiral&quot; class Vikings, these were wound down in favour of concentrating all of BEA&#x27;s London flights at Heathrow. A Jersey-bound Pionair in October 1954 was BEA&#x27;s final flight from Northolt.

The Viscount&#x27;s commercial success had made it the leading short-haul aircraft in Europe in the mid-1950s. This led Lord Douglas to believe that turboprops would continue to be the mainstay of BEA&#x27;s fleet into the 1960s.

On 31 March 1955, BEA completed its first profitable financial year, recording an operating profit of ¬£552,314 and a net profit of ¬£63,039.

In July 1955, BEA became the launch customer for the Vanguard, Vickers&#x27; new high-capacity turboprop powered by four Rolls-Royce RB109 &quot;Tyne&quot; engines. The airline&#x27;s launch order was for 20 aircraft, including six Vanguard V.951s and 14 heavier V.953s.

In mid-1955, BEA entered into a 10-year operating agreement with its associate Cambrian Airways. This resulted in the latter launching new services from Liverpool and Manchester to Jersey (via Bristol and Cardiff) on behalf of the former.

In its 1955‚Äì56 financial year, BEA carried more than two million passengers for the first time at an all-time high average load factor of 69.4%. During that period, it recorded a profit of ¬£603,614, mainly as a result of revenue growth accounted for by the Viscount fleet.

In 1956, BEA acquired a 25% minority shareholding in Jersey Airlines and the corporation&#x27;s Southampton‚ÄìGuernsey and Southampton‚ÄìAlderney routes transferred to the independent.

1956 was also the year BEA began using Viscounts for nightfreight operations to increase cargo capacity as well as the aircraft&#x27;s utilisation. While BEA continued taking delivery of Viscount 701s, it placed its first order for 12 larger 66- to 68-seat Viscount 802/806s. These were delivered from February 1957. By 1958, BEA had 77 Viscounts in service.

On 7 February 1958, BEA acquired a 33‚Öì% minority shareholding in Welsh independent regional airline Cambrian Airways.

In March 1958, BEA ordered six de Havilland DH106 Comet 4B jet aircraft for delivery from 1960. This was BEA&#x27;s answer to the impending introduction of the Sud-Est Caravelle, Air France&#x27;s new short-/medium-range jet, on the French flag carrier&#x27;s European, North African and Middle Eastern network, including the prime Heathrow ‚Äì Le Bourget route from July 1959.

The arrival at Heathrow on 30 July 1958 of a BEA Elizabethan from Cologne marked the type&#x27;s last service with the airline. Although its operating costs on short routes such as London‚ÄìParis were lower than the Viscount&#x27;s, the piston type could not match the turboprop&#x27;s passenger appeal. Unlike the Pionairs and Leopards, which continued serving regional feeder and freight routes, Elizabethans were deployed on trunk routes where passenger appeal was more important; this further hastened their demise in BEA service.

On 12 August 1959, BEA signed a ¬£28 million contract for 24 de Havilland DH121 Trident Mark 1(C) &quot;second-generation&quot; jets plus 12 options, making it the launch customer for the world&#x27;s first commercial T-tailed rear-engined trijet due to enter service in spring 1964. (This version of the Trident was smaller and lighter than de Havilland&#x27;s original DH121 of 1956. At that time BEA&#x27;s chairman, Anthony Milward, had insisted that a launch order from BEA depended on scaling down the original design, in the belief that the Vickers Vanguard high-capacity turboprops it had ordered the year before would remain competitive against jets on trunk routes as a result of lower operating and seat-mile costs. BEA&#x27;s insistence on building the Trident smaller with less powerful engines and a lower fuel capacity than originally proposed was also a manifestation of the cautious attitude of the airline&#x27;s senior management against a backdrop of a [temporary] reduction in its profit margin and slowdown in its growth rate. Meeting BEA&#x27;s specifications for the Trident involved reducing the length of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, its wingspan and weight and replacing the Rolls-Royce RB141/3 &quot;Medway&quot; engines with Rolls-Royce RB163 &quot;Speys&quot;. Shrinking the original design also reduced seating capacity from 111‚Äì130 to 79‚Äì90, in mixed- and single-class configuration respectively.)

On 7 November 1959, BEA took delivery of its first Comet 4B (G-APMB), nearly two months ahead of the contracted delivery on 1 January 1960. This was followed by the official handover ceremony of the airline&#x27;s first jet airliner on 16 November.

In its 1959‚Äì60 financial year, BEA carried 3.29 million passengers and recorded a profit of ¬£2.09 million.

On 1 April 1960, BEA began commercial jet operations with its new Comet 4Bs. On that day, the airline commenced jet operations from Heathrow to Athens, Istanbul, Moscow, Munich, Rome and Warsaw with an initial, five-strong Comet fleet. By June, this fleet grew to seven (out of an eventual 18) aircraft, enabling the launch of additional jet services to Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, D√ºsseldorf, Malta, Z√ºrich and Frankfurt.

On 27 September 1960, BEA welcomed its 25-millionth passenger.

Also in 1960, BEA took delivery of its final two Viscount 701s bringing its total fleet strength of this sub-type to 50.

1960 was furthermore the year the UK Parliament enacted the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act 1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2. c. 38), which abolished the statutory monopoly BEA and BOAC had enjoyed on principal domestic and international scheduled routes since the beginning of the post-war era. In theory, this gave independent airlines equal opportunities to develop scheduled routes in their own right; however, in reality, the corporations would object to applications by independent airlines seeking to be licensed as competitors to the state airlines. Each application by an independent airline for a scheduled route licence was heard by the newly established Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB), the new UK government body in charge of air transport economic regulation that succeeded ATAC. At these hearings, the independents needed to convince the ATLB that there were sufficient passengers to justify the proposed scheduled services, that these stood a reasonable chance of becoming profitable and that they opened up new markets rather than divert traffic from the corporations to overcome the latter&#x27;s objections. Although the ATLB granted British Eagle and British United Airways (BUA), BEA&#x27;s and BOAC&#x27;s two biggest independent competitors during the 1960s, licences to operate rival international scheduled services on several trunk routes from London Heathrow and Gatwick respectively, these airlines were unable to use them without actual traffic rights. For example, lack of traffic rights prevented BUA from running direct London (Gatwick) ‚Äì Paris (Le Bourget) scheduled flights although it held a licence for that route, which the ATLB had awarded it in late 1961. In that case, BUA&#x27;s failure to obtain traffic rights was mainly the result of the French authorities&#x27; refusal to grant these without a corresponding reduction in BEA&#x27;s share of London‚ÄìParis flights.

In its 1960‚Äì61 financial year, BEA carried 3.99 million passengers at an average load factor of 65% and recorded a loss of ¬£1.75 million.

===BEA at its peak (1961‚Äì1971)===

By the early 1960s, BEA carried just under four million passengers per year, more than any other airline in Europe (excluding Aeroflot); worldwide (excluding Aeroflot and the Chinese CAAC Airlines), only the &quot;Big Four&quot; US airlines ‚Äì American Airlines, United Airlines, Pan Am and TWA ‚Äì carried more. By that time, BEA served most major European cities, with the network stretching as far east as Moscow, Kuwait and Doha as well as North Africa to the south, and it was furthermore a founder/minority shareholder of Alitalia, Aer Lingus, Cyprus Airways, Gibraltar Airways and Jersey Airlines.

In 1961, BEA placed an order for three Armstrong Whitworth Argosy all-cargo aircraft. These were the airline&#x27;s first dedicated freighters; the first aircraft was delivered and entered service later the same year.

On 1 March 1961, BEA began commercial Vanguard services following a delay to the aircraft&#x27;s entry into service, as a result of major defects discovered in its Rolls-Royce Tyne engine&#x27;s compressor during testing in early 1960. Following their delayed entry into service, BEA&#x27;s Vanguards began flying to international destinations such as Malta and Barcelona and by 1962, took over approximately half of the flights previously operated by Viscounts on the airline&#x27;s UK domestic trunk routes, where they operated in a 132-seat, single-class configuration. The Vanguards&#x27; introduction on BEA&#x27;s Heathrow‚ÄìScotland trunk routes increased traffic by more than 20%.

On 1 April 1961, BEA moved some flights to Paris (Le Bourget) and other European destinations from Heathrow to Gatwick in accordance with the wishes of the British government to develop the latter airport.

In 1962, BEA sold its 25% minority holding in Jersey Airlines. This was followed by the BUA group&#x27;s takeover of Jersey Airlines in May of that year.

On 19 May 1962, Pionair G-ALTT operated the type&#x27;s final service on BEA&#x27;s Scottish internal network between Islay, Campbeltown and Glasgow (Renfrew).

In its 1962-63 annual report, BEA estimated that introduction of both the Comet 4B and Vanguard had cost it more than ¬£6 million over a two-year period. The airline considered this &quot;a heavy financial burden&quot; in support of British aircraft manufacturers, which adversely impacted its ability to compete with overseas rivals whose choice of aircraft was not influenced by political considerations.

In November 1963, BEA&#x27;s independent rival British Eagle became the first independent airline to compete with it on a main UK domestic trunk route, when the independent launched daily scheduled services between London Heathrow and Glasgow with 103-seater, two-class Bristol Britannias. This was followed by daily two-class Britannia services from Heathrow to Edinburgh and Belfast the next day. This was also the first time a scheduled airline had offered a separate first class cabin on a domestic route in the UK. As British Eagle was restricted to a single daily round-trip on each route, it sought to differentiate itself from BEA. While BEA served these routes with 132-seat Vanguards in an all-tourist configuration with minimal onboard catering, British Eagle provided full catering on all flights. British Eagle furthermore differentiated itself from its state-owned competitor by introducing assigned seating and &quot;trickle loading&quot;. The former was a first for a UK scheduled domestic carrier while the airline claimed to have started the latter in the UK as well. BEA, whose frequencies were not restricted, responded to the challenge on its three most important domestic routes by scheduling additional flights that departed and arrived at the same time or within 10 minutes of its rival&#x27;s scheduled departure and arrival times. This had the effect of &quot;sandwiching&quot; British Eagle&#x27;s flights. BEA&#x27;s response also included the introduction of trickle loading and subsequent introduction of full onboard catering as well as a separate first class cabin.

On 11 March 1964, a BEA Trident 1C operated the Trident&#x27;s first commercial service, standing in for a Comet 4B that had been scheduled to fly 79 fare-paying passengers from Heathrow to Copenhagen. BEA&#x27;s regular commercial Trident operations commenced on 1 April 1964. Initially, BEA operated its Tridents in a 79-seat, two-class configuration, comprising 15 first class and 64 tourist class seats.

In June 1964, BEA acquired a minority shareholding in Northeast England-based independent regional airline BKS Air Transport.

On 10 June 1965, BEA Trident 1C G-ARPR performed the world&#x27;s first automatic touchdown at London Heathrow on a commercial flight with fare-paying passengers. Another BEA Trident performed the world&#x27;s first fully automatic landing in fog by a civil aircraft in zero visibility at Heathrow in November 1966.

On 26 August 1965, BEA signed the contract for a follow-on Trident order. This covered 15 firm Trident 2Es plus 10 options for delivery from spring 1968. The 2E series was an aerodynamically improved version of the original 1C series incorporating the re-arranged interior of the &quot;hot-and-high&quot; 1E series that resulted in a greater seating capacity, as well as a higher gross weight, increased fuel capacity by providing an additional fuel tank in the fin and more powerful Rolls-Royce Spey engines to fly non-stop from London to Beirut with 90 passengers.

In the mid-1960s, BEA&#x27;s European rivals began placing orders for new &quot;second-generation&quot; jet aircraft, such as the Boeing 727-200 and its smaller stablemate, the 737-200, as well as the Douglas DC-9-30/40. Compared with the Trident, these were more economical, in terms of range, revenue generation and seat-mile costs. Of particular concern to BEA in this context were Air France&#x27;s plans to replace Caravelles with new 727-200s on most of its London‚ÄìParis flights. BEA also had a requirement for a jet to replace Vanguards on the Heathrow‚ÄìManchester route to regain traffic lost to British Rail as a result of the electrification of the London‚ÄìManchester line and Berlin-based Viscounts to restore the competitive balance with Pan Am&#x27;s new 727s on the internal German services. Therefore, in February 1966, BEA began evaluating the 727-200, 737-200 and DC-9-40 for these requirements, favouring the former two seating up to 166 and 111 passengers in single-class configuration respectively. In June 1966, BEA requested UK government permission to place an order with Boeing for 18 727-200s and 23 737-200s. Following the UK government&#x27;s refusal to grant BEA permission to order an all-American fleet of Boeing 727-200s and 737-200s, the Board of Trade (BOT) directed the airline to buy comparable British aircraft instead. This resulted in a BEA order for 18 firm BAC One-Eleven 500s plus six options in January 1967, for delivery from autumn 1968, to meet BEA&#x27;s requirement to replace Vanguards/Viscounts on its Heathrow‚ÄìManchester and internal German routes.

In February 1967, BEA sought UK government approval to order up to 40 BAC Two-Elevens, a 200-seat, six-abreast development of the five-abreast BAC One-Eleven powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 high-bypass turbofan engines, for service entry in the early 1970s. The UK government&#x27;s refusal to let BEA order American aircraft, as well as its subsequent decision to stop funding the development of BAC&#x27;s Two-Eleven and a delay to the rival Rolls-Royce RB207-powered, 250-seat pan-European Airbus A300 widebody, also resulted in another Trident order from the airline for 26 firm 3B series aircraft plus 10 options in early 1968, for delivery from 1971.

As this necessitated the purchase of a greater number of aircraft with fewer seats and less range that needed to be inducted into the fleet over a shorter period of time due to later availability compared with the originally chosen American aircraft, BEA had made both its ¬£32 million One-Eleven 500 order and ¬£83 million Trident 3B order dependent on receiving a subsidy from the UK government to compensate it for having been directed against its commercial judgement to order British aircraft with a lower earning potential and later delivery dates. The UK government responded to BEA&#x27;s plea by agreeing to transfer ¬£25 million from the airline&#x27;s existing borrowings to a special account on which no interest was payable, including the option to transfer this amount to its profit and loss account as required. This arrangement furthermore permitted a subsequent transfer to BEA of an additional ¬£12.5 million in case this was required.

BEA&#x27;s first order for the BAC One-Eleven enabled BAC to proceed with the development of the 500 series, a more powerful, stretched version of the original One-Eleven 200 launched by BEA&#x27;s independent rival British United Airways in 1961; its second repeat-order for Tridents launched the 3B series, a more powerful, aerodynamically enhanced, stretched version of the earlier Trident models already in service with/ordered by the airline. The 3B had an unusual (and noisy) feature, a small fourth engine (a Rolls-Royce RB162) in the base of the tailfin to increase power during takeoff. The One-Eleven 510EDs ordered by BEA had a range of and were configured for 97 passengers in a single class while the Trident 3Bs entered service with the airline either in a 152-seat, single-class or a 130-seat, two-class configuration. BEA&#x27;s BAC One-Eleven 510EDs and Hawker Siddeley Trident 3Bs also featured common instrumentation to attain a high degree of commonality. This was achieved by having Smiths supply the avionics of both aircraft, which in the case of the One-Eleven replaced the Collins avionics found on all other 500 series.

The differences in flight deck layout between the 510ED and other 500 series were so significant that a separate aircraft type rating was required to fly the former. Another notable difference between the 510ED and all other 500 series was that the former&#x27;s Rolls-Royce RB163-25 Mk 512-11 Spey engines lacked the latter&#x27;s Mk 512-14DWs&#x27; demineralised water injection system, and that these engines were rated at the same thrust as the Speys powering BEA&#x27;s Trident 2Es and 3Bs. To compensate for the 510ED&#x27;s lower rated engines, no forward integral airstairs were fitted. The resulting weight saving permitted an increase in payload. It also offset (to some extent) the additional costs of customisation to attain commonality with the Trident 3B. Although unique in the context of the 500 series, the absence of forward airstairs was a characteristic BEA&#x27;s 510EDs shared with BUA&#x27;s 201ACs.

On 4 January 1966, BEA&#x27;s biggest independent rival, BUA, simultaneously launched daily BAC One-Eleven jet services from Gatwick to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast, which indirectly competed with the corporation&#x27;s London‚ÄìScotland and London ‚Äì Northern Ireland trunk routes from Heathrow. This allowed BUA to steal a march on BEA by becoming the first scheduled all-jet operator on UK domestic trunk routes.

In November 1966, BEA increased its shareholding in BKS Air Transport to 50%.

In March 1967, BEA established British Air Services as a new holding company for BKS Air Transport and Cambrian Airways, its two loss-making regional airline subsidiaries.

1967 was also the year the Wilson government appointed a committee of inquiry under the chairmanship of Professor Sir Ronald Edwards, at the time the chairman of the Electricity Council and a professor at the London School of Economics, to deliberate the future prospects of Britain&#x27;s air transport industry. The Edwards Committee published its report entitled &quot;British Air Transport in the Seventies&quot; on 2 May 1969. Its principal recommendations were
* creation of a British Airways Board to bring both BEA and BOAC under joint management control
* creation of a majority privately owned &quot;Second Force&quot; airline to counterbalance the near-monopoly of the corporations, which provided 90% of all UK scheduled air transport capacity at the time
* permitting the corporations to participate in the inclusive tour (IT) charter market alongside the independents by establishing dedicated, non-IATA subsidiaries
* creation of a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to combine the separate regulatory functions of the UK Air Registration Board (ARB), ATLB and BOT in a new statutory body with enhanced powers.
The report&#x27;s publication led to the formation of BEA Airtours as BEA&#x27;s wholly owned charter subsidiary later the same year while subsequent adoption of its recommendations by the Heath government resulted in the merger of BEA&#x27;s independent rivals Caledonian Airways and BUA to form Caledonian//BUA, which assumed the role of the &quot;Second Force&quot; in November 1970. To enable the new &quot;Second Force&quot; to become viable and to redress the competitive imbalance between it and the corporations, the Heath government ordered a limited route transfer from the latter to the former. For BEA this entailed the loss of the Heathrow ‚Äì Le Bourget route, which was transferred to its newly formed independent rival to accommodate the newcomer&#x27;s Gatwick ‚Äì Le Bourget service within the constraints of the bilateral air treaty.

On 15 February 1968, BEA took delivery of its first Trident 2E. This was followed by entry into service on the airline&#x27;s routes from Heathrow to Milan, Madrid, Dublin and Stockholm on 1 June that year.

On 1 April 1968, BEA&#x27;s first scheduled service to Paris Orly Airport departed Heathrow; this resulted in splitting its Paris operations between Orly and Le Bourget.

Following its commercial debut on 1 September 1968 on BEA&#x27;s internal German routes, the airline&#x27;s new One-Eleven 500s began regular scheduled operations on 17 November 1968, respectively replacing Vanguards and Viscounts on the corporation&#x27;s Heathrow‚ÄìManchester and Berlin routes.

By 1969, BEA carried 132,000 tonnes of freight each year. That year, it also opened a new cargo centre at Heathrow, which it jointly operated with BOAC. To cope with increasing amounts of air freight, it began replacing its nine Argosy freighters with the same number of Vickers V.953C Merchantmans, which were converted V.953 Vanguard passenger planes. Aviation Traders Engineering Limited (ATEL) of Southend converted the first two of these while BEA&#x27;s inhouse engineering department converted the remainder using kits supplied by ATEL.

In its 1969‚Äì70 financial year, BEA&#x27;s revenue from ticket sales was ¬£126 million resulting in a profit of ¬£6.5 million, almost twice the previous year&#x27;s and the biggest in the airline&#x27;s history until that time.

In its 1970‚Äì71 financial year, BEA carried 8.67 million passengers at an average load factor of just over 54%. During that period it employed just under 25,000 people, revenues totalled ¬£133 million and the operating loss stood at ¬£780,000.

On 18 February 1971, BEA received its first Trident 3B. Commercial operations began on 1 March of that year on the airline&#x27;s Heathrow‚ÄìOrly route.

On 31 October 1971, BEA operated its last scheduled service from Heathrow to Le Bourget, marking the end of 25 years&#x27; continuous operations by the airline at the historic Paris airport. This move was necessitated by the Anglo-French bilateral air treaty to make room for British Caledonian&#x27;s Gatwick ‚Äì Le Bourget service, which began the following day. This in turn resulted in all of BEA&#x27;s Heathrow‚ÄìParis flights exclusively using Orly from then on.

In early-December 1971, BEA bought both of Channel Airways&#x27; Trident 1Es for use by the airline&#x27;s Channel Islands Airways division and Northeast Airlines on mainline routes from Birmingham and regional routes from Newcastle and Leeds/Bradford respectively. Together with the ongoing Trident 3B deliveries, this additional Trident purchase would bring the total number of Tridents in BEA&#x27;s fleet to 67, making the type its most numerous jetliner.

1971 was also the year BEA underwent a major reorganisation under its then chairman Henry Marking entailing the establishment of 10 divisions that were meant to act as profit centres. These were
* BEA Mainline
* BEA Cargo
* Super One-Eleven
* Scottish Airways
* Channel Islands Airways
* BEA Helicopters
* BEA Airtours
* British Air Services
* Travel Sales
* Sovereign Group Hotels.

BEA Mainline assumed responsibility for all of BEA&#x27;s Heathrow operations other than those to and from Manchester, Leeds/Bradford, Liverpool, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Inverness, the Isle of Man, Berlin (including both non-stop and one-stop services) and certain regional European destinations such as Bordeaux, Cork, Luxembourg and Rimini, as well as its Birmingham operations other than those to and from the Channel Islands.

BEA Cargo assumed responsibility for all of BEA&#x27;s freight activities, including all pure freighter aircraft.

The Super One-Eleven division was headquartered in Manchester. It assumed responsibility for BEA&#x27;s entire BAC One-Eleven 500 fleet and all of the airline&#x27;s Manchester operations other than those to and from the Channel Islands, as well as all of its Berlin operations, with at least six aircraft based at Ringway and up to 12 at Tempelhof. From 1 April 1973, it also began replacing Viscounts and Tridents plying the Aberdeen‚ÄìHeathrow route on behalf of BEA&#x27;s Scottish Airways division with One-Eleven 500s, as the latter were more efficient and had greater passenger appeal.

The Scottish Airways division was headquartered in Glasgow and assumed responsibility for all of BEA&#x27;s Scottish internal routes, as well as all of the airline&#x27;s Glasgow‚ÄìBelfast, Aberdeen‚ÄìHeathrow and Inverness‚ÄìHeathrow services. In addition to its Viscount mainline aircraft, Scottish Airways also operated a dedicated fleet of smaller regional feeder aircraft. These served remote communities in Scotland&#x27;s Highlands and Islands region.

The Channel Islands Airways division assumed responsibility for all of BEA&#x27;s services to and from the Channel Islands other than those to and from Heathrow, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds/Bradford, Liverpool and Newcastle. It also operated domestic and international routes from Birmingham, using a dedicated Trident 1E, as well as a mix of Scottish and Channel Islands Viscounts.

BEA&#x27;s wholly owned helicopter subsidiary assumed responsibility for its entire rotorcraft fleet and all of the airline&#x27;s rotorcraft operations, including the scheduled service between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly.

BEA&#x27;s wholly owned charter subsidiary BEA Airtours assumed responsibility for all of its regular, non-IATA flying activities using fixed-wing aircraft ‚Äì i.e., predominantly IT charter flights under contract to third-party tour operators.

The British Air Services division assumed responsibility for Cambrian Airways and Northeast Airlines, BEA&#x27;s two majority-owned regional airline subsidiaries. This included all services operated by these airlines on behalf of their parent company, principally all of the corporation&#x27;s domestic and international services from and to Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds/Bradford, Liverpool, Newcastle and the Isle of Man, as well as selected international regional services from Heathrow such as Bordeaux, Cork, Luxembourg and Rimini.

Travel Sales assumed responsibility for all of BEA&#x27;s sales-related activities.

Sovereign Group Hotels assumed responsibility for the management of all Sovereign hotels, BEA&#x27;s associated hotel chain.

===BEA‚ÄìBOAC merger (1972‚Äì1974)===

====British Airways Board (1972)====
The first attempt at a merger of BEA and BOAC arose in 1953 out of inconclusive attempts between the two airlines to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of the idea as a potential solution to a disagreement between the two airlines as to which should serve the increasingly important oil regions of the Middle East, and he had backing for his proposal from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the idea, and an agreement was reached instead to allow BEA to serve Ankara in Turkey, and in return to leave all routes east and south of Cyprus to BOAC. Paradoxically, through its effective control of Cyprus Airways, BEA was able to continue to serve destinations ceded to BOAC, including Beirut and Cairo by using Cyprus Airways as its proxy.

However, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report, that a new British Airways Board, combining BEA and BOAC, was constituted on 1 April 1972. This event coincided with the establishment of the CAA, the UK&#x27;s new, unified regulator for the air transport industry.

One of the newly formed British Airways Board&#x27;s first major decisions was to place a ¬£60 million order for six Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Lockheed L-1011 TriStar series 1 widebodies on BEA&#x27;s behalf, with an option on six more for either BEA or BOAC. BEA was to take delivery of its first widebodied aircraft during the fourth quarter of 1974.

On 1 September 1972, BEA became the British European Airways Division of the newly formed British Airways Group.

In its 1973‚Äì74 financial year, BEA&#x27;s last, the airline carried 8.74 million passengers and ‚Äì excluding losses on its Scottish and Channel Islands operations ‚Äì recorded its highest-ever profit of ¬£6.7 million.

====British Airways (1974)====

BEA ceased operations on 1 April 1974 when it merged with BOAC to form British Airways. A BEA Trident operated the airline&#x27;s final flight from Dublin to Heathrow on 31 March 1974. Following the late-night arrival at Heathrow at 23:30 hrs of flight BE 943 (&quot;Bealine 943&quot;), BEA passed into history as of 00:00 hrs the following day.
However, even after the merger, a British Airways European Division, which incorporated the former BEA Mainline operation, the erstwhile Super One-Eleven and Cargo divisions, as well as British Airtours, continued to exist alongside a British Airways Overseas, a British Airways Regional and four other divisions until 1 April 1977 when these were replaced by a unified operating structure organised into a number of departments, including commercial operations, flight operations, engineering, planning, catering and personnel. These organisational changes were accompanied by the adoption of a single, two-letter, IATA airline identification code for the entire airline, i.e., BA, the old BOAC/Overseas Division code. Until then, each of the three main airline divisions had its own two-letter, IATA airline identification code, BA for Overseas, BE for European and BZ for Regional.

===Highlands and islands operations===

====Scotland====

The Dragon Rapides BEA had inherited from Scottish Airways and other former independent airlines it had taken over in early-1947 initially operated the corporation&#x27;s Scottish routes, including services to remote communities in the Highlands and Islands.

From 1948, BEA Dragon Rapides were contracted to operate the Scottish Air Ambulance Service.

In 1952, BEA began replacing Dragon Rapides with Pionairs across its Scottish network; however, the pre-war de Havilland biplanes continued serving Barra as no other contemporary type in BEA&#x27;s fleet could take off from and land on the island&#x27;s beach airstrip. The Scottish Air Ambulance Service continued to contract BEA Dragon Rapides as well.

Following successful trials of de Havilland&#x27;s Heron Series 1 demonstrator G-ALZL on BEA&#x27;s Channel Islands routes during the second half of 1951, the airline placed an order for two 1B series aircraft to replace &quot;Islander&quot; class Rapides on its Glasgow‚ÄìBarra route as it was well-suited to serving restricted airfields in difficult weather conditions. Both aircraft were delivered in February 1955, wearing BEA&#x27;s contemporary bare metal finish livery incorporating a burgundy cheatline separated by two thin, white lines above the cabin windows. In BEA service the Herons were known as &quot;Hebridean&quot; class aircraft seating 14 passengers on regular commercial flights. The Heron operated its first air ambulance service on 4 March 1955 while BEA crews were still undergoing conversion training on the new type. This was followed by a naming ceremony for both aircraft held at Glasgow&#x27;s Renfrew Airport on 18 March 1955, when each aircraft was named after a Scottish medical pioneer (G-ANXA, the second aircraft to be delivered on 23 February 1955, was named &quot;John Hunter&quot; while G-ANXB, the first aircraft to be delivered on 12 February 1955, was named &quot;Sir James Young Simpson&quot;). Scheduled operations commenced on 18 April 1955, following which one aircraft was exclusively used on scheduled services while the other was kept on stand-by for air ambulance duties. An expansion of BEA&#x27;s scheduled activities within the Scottish mainland as well as between the mainland and the Outer Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetlands necessitated the acquisition of a third aircraft to provide adequate cover for the air ambulance service. This resulted in an order for a third Heron 1B, which was delivered on 13 April 1956. This aircraft (G-AOFY, &quot;Sir Charles Bell&quot;) crashed on 28 September 1957 while on an air ambulance service to Port Ellen/Glenegedale Airport, Islay, Inner Hebrides, with the loss of the pilot, and duty nurse on board.

From 1962, BEA supplemented the Herons it used on its Scottish internal services with three new, 48-seater Handley Page Dart Herald 100 series turboprops. These had originally been ordered in 1959 through the Ministry of Supply, which leased them to the airline. BEA operated its first commercial Herald service on 16 April 1962 on the Northern Isles route from Glasgow to Sumburgh via Wick, Aberdeen and Kirkwall. However, BEA operated its Heralds, which wore the red, black and white livery, only for a few years because of high crew training, maintenance and spares costs.

1962 was also the year BEA introduced Viscounts on its Scottish network. These took over the routes to Benbecula and Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides from 21 May, only two days after BEA&#x27;s last-ever Pionair service from Islay via Campbeltown to Renfrew.

From October 1966, BEA operated only Viscounts and Herons on its Scottish network. It used the former on the busier, longer routes while it utilised the latter on short feeder routes to/from restricted airfields serving remote communities as well as on the air ambulance service.

To improve the financial prospects of its loss-making Scottish routes, BEA established Scottish Airways Division in 1971. Glasgow-headquartered Scottish Airways became financially accountable for BEA&#x27;s Scottish internal routes. It also assumed financial responsibility for the airline&#x27;s services from Glasgow to Belfast, as well as from Aberdeen and Inverness to Heathrow. While it was initially operationally responsible for its entire network as well as the Scottish Air Ambulance Service, operational responsibility for the Aberdeen‚ÄìHeathrow route passed to BEA&#x27;s Super One-Eleven division on 1 April 1973 when the latter&#x27;s One-Eleven 500s began replacing Scottish Airways Viscounts and mainline division Tridents.

In November 1972, BEA ordered two Short Skyliner turboprops, a 19-seat all-passenger version of the Short Skyvan utility aircraft, to replace the ageing Herons. Following BEA&#x27;s last scheduled Heron service from Barra via Tiree to Glasgow in March 1973 and successful route trials of the new Skyliners, which wore a modified BEA &quot;Speedjack&quot; livery incorporating dual &quot;BEA&quot;/&quot;British airways&quot; titles, the latter debuted on BEA&#x27;s Scottish internal services from Glasgow to Barra and Campbeltown. BEA&#x27;s Skyliners were intended to replace the airline&#x27;s Herons as air ambulances as well; however, when Glasgow-based independent air taxi, charter and regional scheduled operator Loganair assumed responsibility for the Scottish Air Ambulance Service on 1 April 1973, the Skyliners had yet to enter service. This turn of events therefore marked the end of BEA&#x27;s air ambulance services in Scotland after 25 years&#x27; continuous operation.

On 31 March 1974, the British Airways Board placed an order for two British Aerospace 748 Series 2B turboprops for delivery to British Airways in 1975. These were intended to replace ageing Viscounts on the Scottish routes the new airline would inherit from BEA the following day, as well as for use on North Sea oil exploration flights.

====Channel Islands====
BEA acquired a presence in the Channel Islands as a result of the takeover of Channel Islands Airways on 1 April 1947. Channel Islands Airways was the holding company and successor of pre-war independent scheduled airlines Jersey Airways and Guernsey Airways. It was also among the independents that were absorbed into BEA following their nationalisation which began earlier that year.

BEA commenced its services in the Channel Islands in 1947, using Dragon Rapides inherited from its independent predecessors.

Following the transfer of BEA&#x27;s London‚ÄìJersey route from Croydon to Northolt on 21 April 1947, DC-3s began replacing Rapides on most services. By 2 November 1947, all of the corporation&#x27;s London‚ÄìGuernsey flights had moved from Croydon to Northolt as well.

In 1949, BEA expanded its fledgling Channel Islands operations by inaugurating London‚ÄìAlderney and inter-island scheduled services linking Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney.

On 28 April 1950, BEA launched a summer service from Gatwick to Alderney, the airline&#x27;s first scheduled route from Gatwick as well as its first scheduled service from there to the Channel Islands. Additional scheduled services from Birmingham and Manchester to the islands began the following month.

In 1951, BEA launched a Glasgow‚ÄìJersey summer service with DC-3s, the airline&#x27;s first direct service between Scotland and the Channel Islands. During that year&#x27;s second half, it also successfully trialled de Havilland&#x27;s Heron 1 demonstrator on its Channel Islands network.

In April 1952, a new Exeter‚ÄìJersey route launched, which BEA contracted to its new independent associate Jersey Airlines. Two months later, a new paved runway opened at Jersey, which enabled the introduction of bigger, heavier aircraft types on BEA&#x27;s (and other airlines&#x27;) services to and from the island.

In Summer 1953, BEA introduced &quot;Elizabethan&quot; class Ambassador aircraft on its London‚ÄìJersey route.

Following the departure of BEA&#x27;s last flight from Northolt to Jersey in October 1954, the airline&#x27;s London ‚Äì Channel Islands flights served the British capital exclusively via Heathrow.

In 1955, BEA ordered two de Havilland Heron 2 series aircraft for use on its Channel Island feeder routes. These differed from the pair of 1B series Herons used on the airline&#x27;s Scottish feeder network and air ambulance services in terms of their undercarriage; the series 2 had a retractable undercarriage while the series 1&#x27;s was fixed. Following BEA&#x27;s acquisition of a 25% minority stake in its regional associate Jersey Airlines and a subsequent transfer of routes from the corporation to the independent in 1956, the Heron 2s ordered by the former were delivered to the latter.

BEA&#x27;s withdrawal from Alderney, as well as from Southampton‚ÄìGuernsey, Jersey‚ÄìDinard and Guernsey‚ÄìDinard, on 20 April 1956 coincided with the airline&#x27;s last Rapide service in the Channel Islands. 1956 was also the year that saw Viscounts supplementing DC-3s/Pionairs on the corporation&#x27;s Heathrow‚ÄìJersey route as well as a new summer service from Belfast to Jersey.

BEA&#x27;s acquisition of minority stakes in its independent associates Jersey Airlines and Cambrian Airways in 1956 and 1958 respectively resulted in the former&#x27;s withdrawal from a number of mainly secondary routes serving the Channel islands, which were transferred to the latter.

The launch of a new BEA summer weekend service from Aberdeen via Edinburgh to Jersey in 1957 was followed by the transfer of most of the corporation&#x27;s London‚ÄìJersey and London‚ÄìGuernsey flights from Heathrow to Gatwick when the latter reopened as London&#x27;s second airport on 9 June 1958, in line with contemporary UK government policy to develop the airport.

On 1 August 1960, a new paved runway opened at Guernsey, which enabled the introduction of bigger, heavier aircraft types on BEA&#x27;s (and other airlines&#x27;) services to and from the island.

The withdrawal of Pionairs from BEA&#x27;s Channel Islands services on 20 March 1961 resulted in the transfer of operations from Southampton to Bournemouth to enable the introduction of Viscounts, which were too heavy for the former&#x27;s grass runways. On 21 March 1961, BEA launched year-round Viscount services from Bournemouth to Jersey and Guernsey. 1961 also saw BEA&#x27;s first dedicated pure freight services from both London and Southampton to Jersey. These were operated with &quot;Leopard&quot; class DC-3 freighters. The same year, BEA furthermore terminated its association agreement with Jersey Airlines as both airlines had become competitors on the prime London‚ÄìJersey and London‚ÄìGuernsey trunk routes as a result of the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act that had been enacted the year before. This had abolished the corporations&#x27; statutory monopoly on principal domestic and international scheduled routes.

On 31 March 1962, BEA disposed of its minority holding in Jersey Airlines. The following month, Argosies replaced Leopards on BEA&#x27;s London‚ÄìJersey freight run.

In April 1963, most of the corporation&#x27;s London ‚Äì Channel Island flights transferred back to Heathrow as a result of the new competitive relationship between BEA and its former associate Jersey Airlines. The following month, BEA launched a London‚ÄìGuernsey Argosy freighter service.

On 1 June 1964, Vanguards made their debut on BEA&#x27;s Heathrow‚ÄìJersey route. BEA subsequently introduced the type on selected services from Heathrow as well as Manchester.

Between November 1965 and February 1966, BEA Helicopters temporarily operated S-61Ns on behalf of its parent company on the Jersey‚ÄìGuernsey inter-island service while Jersey&#x27;s runway was being resurfaced during daytime.

On 1 April 1966, BEA resumed Southampton‚ÄìJersey services following the replacement of Southampton&#x27;s grass runways with a paved runway suitable for bigger, heavier aircraft types such as the Viscount and Vanguard.

Following a successful proving flight on 18 July 1967, BEA introduced Vanguards on selected flights serving Guernsey.

On 31 March 1969, BEA withdrew its Jersey‚ÄìGuernsey inter-island service, which was taken over by Alderney-based independent air taxi, charter and regional scheduled operator Aurigny Air Services.

To improve the financial prospects of its loss-making Channel Islands operations, BEA established Channel Islands Airways Division in 1971. BEA&#x27;s Channel Islands Airways division assumed financial and operational responsibility for all of its routes serving the Channel Islands except those serving the islands from Heathrow, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds/Bradford, Liverpool and Newcastle.

====Isle of Man====
BEA acquired a presence in the Isle of Man as a result of the takeover of Isle of Man Air Services in 1947. Operations in the island commenced the same year with Dragon Rapides inherited from its independent predecessors.

In July 1954, BEA operated a proving flight from the mainland to the island using a Vickers Viscount turboprop.
In summer 1955, BEA began supplementing DC-3s with Viscounts on its Manchester ‚Äì Isle of Man route.

On 31 October 1960, BEA operated its last Pionair services to the Isle of Man.

On 1 April 1963, Cambrian Airways took over BEA&#x27;s remaining routes to and from the Isle of Man as well as all of the corporation&#x27;s services between Liverpool and Belfast. This route transfer also resulted in Cambrian&#x27;s acquisition of six ex-BEA Viscount 701s, its first turboprop aircraft, to serve the Welsh regional carrier&#x27;s enlarged network.

====Isles of Scilly====
Following the inauguration of scheduled services between Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall and St Mary&#x27;s in the Isles of Scilly in 1947, BEA continued serving this route with Dragon Rapides due to a lack of a suitable fixed-wing alternative until BEA Helicopters took it over on 2 May 1964. On that day, BEA&#x27;s remaining three Rapides were replaced with its helicopter subsidiary&#x27;s new Sikorsky S-61N rotorcraft on the Scillies route.

===Overseas-based operations===

====BEA in Berlin====
From 1946 until 1974, BEA operated a comprehensive network of high-frequency, short-haul scheduled services between West Germany and West Berlin. This had come about as a result of an agreement between the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union at the end of World War II, which prohibited Germany from having its own airlines and restricted the provision of commercial air services to and from Berlin to air transport providers headquartered in these four countries. Rising Cold War tensions between the Soviet Union and the three Western powers resulted in unilateral Soviet withdrawal from attendance at the Four Power Allied Control Council in 1948, culminating in the division of Germany the following year. Soviet insistence on a very narrow interpretation of the post-war agreement on the Western powers&#x27; access rights to Berlin meant that until the end of the Cold War air transport in West Berlin continued to be confined to the carriers of the Allied Control Commission powers. Aircraft had to fly across hostile East German territory through three wide air corridors at a maximum altitude of .

BEA&#x27;s first-ever internal German flight took to the air in September 1946 when one of its DC-3s departed Hamburg Fuhlsb√ºttel for RAF Gatow in Berlin.

During the 1948‚Äì49 Berlin Airlift, BEA co-ordinated the operations of the 25 British airlines that participated in the Airlift&#x27;s &quot;Operation Plainfare&quot;.

On 8 July 1951, BEA transferred its operations from Gatow to Tempelhof, thereby concentrating all West Berlin air services at Berlin&#x27;s city centre airport.

BEA&#x27;s move to Tempelhof resulted in a significant increase in passenger numbers due to the removal of Allied restrictions on the carriage of local civilians on commercial airline services from/to West Berlin and Tempelhof&#x27;s central location. This enabled the airline to expand its Berlin-based fleet to six Douglas DC-3s.

During the early-to-mid-1950s, BEA leased in aircraft that were bigger than its Tempelhof-based fleet of DC-3/Pionair, Viking and Elizabethan piston-engined airliners from other operators to boost capacity, following a steady increase in the airline&#x27;s passenger loads. (BEA continued to augment its Berlin fleet with additional aircraft leased from other airlines on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. This included an ex-Transair Vickers Viscount 700 belonging to its newly formed independent rival British United Airways, which was damaged beyond repair on 30 October 1961 in a non-fatal landing accident at Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport at the end of a passenger flight that had originated at Tempelhof.)

In 1958, BEA began replacing its ageing piston airliners with Vickers Viscount 701 turboprop aircraft in a high-density, 63-seat single class seating arrangement. Up to 10 new Vickers Viscount 802s, which featured a more spacious, 66-seat single-class seating arrangement, soon replaced the older series 701 aircraft. The greater range and higher cruising speed of the 802 series enabled BEA to inaugurate a non-stop London Heathrow ‚Äì Berlin Tempelhof service on 1 November 1965.

By 1964, BEA operated up to 20,000 flights each year from and to Berlin. These represented approximately half of the airline&#x27;s total yearly flights to/from Germany and generated profits of ¬£1 million per year.

22 January 1966 marked the first appearance of a British trijet at Tempelhof when Hawker Siddeley flew in its HS 121 Trident 1E demonstrator aircraft for evaluation by BEA. A week later, on 29 January, BEA began evaluating the BAC One-Eleven&#x27;s suitability for its Berlin operations, with the start of a series of test flights conducted on its behalf by BAC&#x27;s 475 series demonstrator. This included a number of takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof to test the aircraft&#x27;s short-field performance.

On 18 March 1966, BEA&#x27;s main competitor on the internal German services (IGS) routes, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), became the first airline to commence regular, year-round jet operations from Tempelhof with new 128-seat, single-class Boeing 727 100 series, one of the first jet aircraft with a short-field capability.

Pan Am&#x27;s move put BEA at a considerable competitive disadvantage, especially on the busy Berlin‚ÄìFrankfurt route where the former out-competed the latter with both modern jet planes as well as a higher flight frequency. BEA responded to Pan Am by increasing the Berlin-based fleet to 13 Viscounts by winter 1966/7 to offer higher frequencies. This also entailed re-configuring aircraft cabins in a lower-density seating arrangement, as a result of which the refurbished cabins featured only 53 Comet-type first-class seats in a four-abreast layout instead of 66 five-abreast economy seats. In addition, BEA sought to differentiate itself from its main competitor by providing a superior in-flight catering standard. (BEA&#x27;s &quot;Silver Star&quot; service included complimentary hot meals on all flights whereas Pan Am only offered free on-board snacks. Sections of the local press dubbed the contrasting strategies of the two main protagonists plying the internal German routes from Berlin ‚Äì estimated to be worth ¬£15‚Äì20 million in annual revenues ‚Äì the &quot;Dinner oder D√ºsen?&quot; (&quot;Dinner or Jet?&quot;) battle.) Henceforth, the airline marketed these services as &quot;Super Silver Star&quot;.

The introduction of Pan Am&#x27;s 727s to the Berlin market represented a major step change because of the aircraft&#x27;s ability to carry more passengers than any other contemporary aircraft type used by scheduled carriers in the short-haul Berlin market, and its ability to take off from and land on Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways with a full commercial payload as only light fuel loads were required on the short internal German services. Compared with BEA, Pan Am&#x27;s 727s carried 20% more passengers than the British carrier&#x27;s Comet 4Bs and up to 2¬Ω times as many passengers as the latter&#x27;s Viscounts.

Within two years of Pan Am&#x27;s introduction of jet equipment on the bulk of its internal German services from/to West Berlin, its market share rose from 58% to 68% while BEA&#x27;s declined from 38% at the beginning of this period to 27% at its end. The lower seat density in BEA&#x27;s re-configured Viscounts combined with higher flight frequencies, superior catering and increased promotion proved insufficient to counter the appeal of Pan Am&#x27;s new jets, despite these being laid out in a comparatively tight, pitch seating configuration. On the other hand, BEA&#x27;s reduced capacity in the domestic air travel market between West Berlin and West Germany enabled it to attain higher load factors than its competitors.

From August 1968, BEA supplemented its Tempelhof-based Viscount fleet with de Havilland Comet 4B series jetliners. Although these aircraft could operate from Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways without payload restrictions, they were not suited to the airline&#x27;s ultra short-haul operation from Berlin (average stage length: ) given the high fuel consumption of the Comet, especially when operating at the mandatory altitude inside the Allied air corridors. This measure was therefore only a stopgap until most of BEA&#x27;s Berlin fleet was equipped with 97-seat, single-class BAC One-Eleven 500s. BEA&#x27;s re-equipment of its Berlin fleet with new One-Eleven 500 jets was central to the airline&#x27;s competitive strategy to regain ground lost to Pan Am&#x27;s 727s. The new One-Eleven 500, which BEA called the &quot;Super One-Eleven&quot;, operated its first scheduled service from Berlin on 1 September 1968. It began replacing the airline&#x27;s Berlin-based Viscounts from 17 November 1968.

Air France, West Berlin&#x27;s third scheduled carrier, which had suffered a continuous traffic decline ever since the transfer of Berlin operations to more distant Tegel at the beginning of 1960 due to Tempelhof&#x27;s operational limitations that made it unsuitable for its Caravelles, was worst affected by the equipment changes at the latter airport during the mid- to late-1960s. To reverse growing losses on its Berlin routes resulting from load factors as low as 30%, Air France decided to withdraw from the internal German market entirely and instead enter into a joint venture with BEA. This arrangement entailed the latter taking over the former&#x27;s two remaining German domestic routes to Frankfurt and Munich and operating these with its own aircraft and flightdeck crews from Tempelhof. It also entailed repainting the fins of the BEA One-Eleven 500s in a neutral, dark-blue scheme featuring &quot;Super One-Eleven&quot; titles instead of BEA&#x27;s &quot;Speedjack&quot; motif. The Air France-BEA joint venture became operational in spring 1969 and terminated in autumn 1972.

By 1971, BEA carried 2 million passengers each year on its Berlin routes. 1971 was also the year the airline&#x27;s last Berlin-based Viscount departed the city.

East Germany&#x27;s relaxation of border controls affecting all surface transport modes between West Berlin and West Germany across its territory from 1972 onwards resulted in a decline of scheduled internal German air traffic from/to West Berlin. This was further compounded by the economic downturn in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. The resulting fare increases that were intended to recover higher operating costs caused by steeply rising jet fuel prices led to a further drop in demand. This in turn resulted in a major contraction of BEA&#x27;s ‚Äì and subsequently British Airways&#x27; ‚Äì (as well as Pan Am&#x27;s) internal German operations, necessitating a reduction in the Berlin-based fleet and workforce in an attempt to contain growing losses these once profitable routes generated by the mid-1970s.

===Subsidiaries===

====BEA Helicopters====

The airline carried out trials with its Helicopter Experiment Unit, operating mail services in East Anglia during 1948 and a passenger service from Cardiff via Wrexham to Liverpool (Speke) Airport in 1950. In 1952, BEA established a base at Gatwick on the site of the airport&#x27;s old Beehive terminal. On 1 January 1964, BEA formed BEA Helicopters as a separate helicopter subsidiary, which established its administrative headquarters and engineering base at Gatwick. Following retirement of BEA&#x27;s Dragon Rapides, BEA Helicopters took over the scheduled service between Land&#x27;s End and the Isles of Scilly on 2 May 1964. On 1 September of that year, the service transferred from Land&#x27;s End St Just airfield to a new, purpose-built heliport at Penzance.

====BEA Airtours====

On 24 April 1969, BEA formed BEA Airtours as a wholly owned, non-IATA subsidiary to provide it with a low-cost platform to participate in the then rapidly growing IT holiday flights market, which until then had been the exclusive domain of the independent airlines. On 6 March 1970, BEA Airtours commenced operations from London Gatwick with a fleet of seven second-hand ex-BEA de Havilland Comet series 4B aircraft seating 109 passengers in a single-class high-density configuration.
 On that day, BEA Airtours&#x27; first revenue flight departed Gatwick for Palma de Mallorca.

====British Air Services====
Following establishment of British Air Services as BEA&#x27;s new holding company for its two loss-making regional airline subsidiaries, BKS Air Transport and Cambrian Airways, in March 1970, the corporation acquired a two-thirds majority shareholding in British Air Services in the autumn of that year to ensure its regional partners&#x27; survival. While this arrangement transferred overall control of BKS and Cambrian to BEA, it left the former&#x27;s identities and local managements in place. This effectively gave BEA the final say in all major policy matters and delegated the day-to-day running of the two smaller airlines to their respective managements. BEA subsequently increased its shareholding in British Air Services to 70%. BEA&#x27;s amalgamation with BOAC to form British Airways on 1 April 1974 resulted in the dissolution of British Air Services and the merger of its constituent members with BEA&#x27;s Scottish and Channel Islands divisions into a new British Airways Regional Division.

====Cyprus Airways====
Cyprus Airways was established on 24 September 1947 as a joint venture between BEA, the British Colonial Government of Cyprus and private interests. Operations commenced on 18 April 1948 with three Douglas DC-3 aircraft. The aeroplanes, which carried 21 passengers each, flew on a route network centred on Nicosia Airport that included Rome, London (via Athens), Beirut, Athens, Cairo, Istanbul, and Haifa. During the next three years the airline purchased an additional three DC-3 aircraft and introduced services to Alexandria, Amman, Bahrain, Khartoum (via Haifa) and Lod.

In 1952, BEA took over the Cyprus Airways service to London with an Airspeed Ambassador, which featured a pressurized cabin that allowed nonstop routing avoiding a stopover in Athens. On 18 April 1953, BEA began using its newly delivered Vickers Viscount 701 on their scheduled service from London to Rome and Athens. The continuing sector from Athens to Nicosia was operated by BEA under charter to Cyprus Airways. This route from London to Nicosia was the world&#x27;s first regular turboprop service.

In September 1957, with the political situation deteriorating in Cyprus, Cyprus Airways entered into a five-year agreement with BEA for the latter to operate services on its behalf. As a result, BEA took over the operation of all Cyprus Airways services from 26 January 1958.

Following independence for Cyprus in 1960, the government of newly independent island became the majority shareholder in Cyprus Airways, with a 53.2 per cent holding, while BEA&#x27;s stake was reduced to 22.7 per cent. Private individuals held the rest. Thereafter, Cypriot nationals began to be hired and trained for the flight crews, which had previously been made up of British expatriates from BEA. Cyprus Airways still relied on BEA for aircraft and in 1961 BEA began introducing Comet 4B jets on all Cyprus Airways routes through a joint aircraft pool arrangement that included Greece&#x27;s Olympic Airways. On 5 April 1960, BEA introduced de Havilland Comet 4B aircraft on the Nicosia, Athens, Rome, and London routes. With the introduction of the Comets, Cyprus Airways became the first airline in the Middle East to have jet airplanes. The Comets flew in the BEA livery, but had the Cyprus Airways logo and title above their doors. In 1965, Cyprus began leasing its own Viscounts from BEA for regional routes. The Comet and Viscount aircraft were replaced with five Trident jets, three of them acquired from BEA. The first Hawker Siddeley Trident jet was introduced in September 1969. Cyprus also leased a BAC 1-11. The faster planes allowed more European trade centres (Frankfurt, Manchester, Brussels, and Paris) to be added to the timetable.

British Airways finally divested itself of its former BEA stake in Cyprus Airways in 1981, selling its shares to the Government of Cyprus.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 7 August 1946, Flight 530, a Douglas C-47A (G-AHCS) crashed into trees on Mistberget mountain while on approach to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen due to pilot error, killing 3 of 16 on board.
* On 15 April 1947, de Havilland Dragon Rapide G-AHKR crashed into Slieau Ruy while operating a scheduled passenger flight from Speke Airport, Liverpool, Lancashire to Ronaldsway Airport, Isle of Man. There were only minor injuries among the six people on board.
* On 6 January 1948, Vickers Viking 1B G-AHPK crashed at Ruislip on approach to RAF Northolt after flying into trees in low visibility killing the pilot and injuring 8 others.
* On 5 April 1948, Vickers Viking 1B G-AIVP operating that day&#x27;s scheduled flight from RAF Northolt via Hamburg to RAF Gatow in Berlin collided during its approach to RAF Gatow with a Soviet Air Force Yakovlev Yak-3 fighter which had been flying dangerously close while performing aerobatics in the area at the time. As a result of the collision, the Viking spiralled out of control and crashed from the airport on East German territory killing all 14 on board. The Soviet fighter pilot was also killed. The accident happened during a period of heightened Cold War tensions over Berlin when Soviet military aircraft frequently &quot;buzzed&quot; Western commercial aircraft inside the Allied air corridors. A British inquiry determined that the Soviet pilot&#x27;s action, which contravened all accepted rules of flying and the specific quadripartite flying rules to which the Soviets were party, was the cause of the accident. The Soviets rejected these findings and blamed the British flightdeck crew instead.
* On 21 April 1948, Flight S200P, a Vickers Viking 1B (G-AIVE), crashed into Irish Law Mountain on approach to Renfrew Airport, Scotland. None of the 20 passengers and crew were killed in the accident but 13 were injured and the aircraft was written off.
* On 30 July 1948, Douglas Dakota C.3 G-AGIX flying from Edinburgh to London belly landed in a field near Sywell following engine problems. All on board survived.
* On 19 February 1949, Douglas C-47A G-AHCW flying from Northolt to Renfrew collided in mid-air with Royal Air Force Avro Anson trainer &quot;VV243&quot; near Coventry killing all 14 passengers and crew on both aircraft. Neither aircraft had seen the other despite clear weather, and the accident was blamed on neither maintaining an adequate look out.
* On 19 August 1949, Douglas C-47A G-AHCY crashed into a hill short of the flight&#x27;s destination at Manchester Airport due to a navigation error and pilot error, killing 24 out of 32 passengers and crew.
* On 13 April 1950, Vickers Viking 1B G-AIVL &quot;Vigilant&quot; was on a flight from London-Northolt Airport to Paris over the English Channel near Hastings when a French passenger was suspected of making a suicide attempt after a bomb exploded in the rear toilet compartment, tearing a hole tall by wide in the fuselage. The flight returned to Northolt and landed safely. The passenger and a flight attendant were injured in the blast. The captain, Ian Harvey DFC, a former RAF Bomber Command pilot, was awarded the George Medal for the &quot;coolness&quot; that had characterised his deportment, throughout the incident: &quot;In the face of this very grave emergency the action of Captain Harvey is worthy of the highest praise. The complete loss of the aircraft and all its company was avoided only as a result of his courage, high skill and presence of mind.&quot; The Flight Safety Foundation also honoured Harvey and his crew with an award. An official inquiry confirmed that a bomb had been detonated in the Viking&#x27;s lavatory, but there was no evidence of how it had been done. The investigation revealed no motive for the attack. Material relating to it in the Public Record Office has been released and is available from The National Archives.
* On 17 October 1950, Douglas Dakota C.3 G-AGIW crashed in Mill Hill shortly after takeoff on a flight from RAF Northolt to Renfrew Airport. The accident killed 28 passengers and crew, leaving only 1 survivor, flight attendant James McKissick. The crew had shut down the No.2 engine after it developed problems, leaving the aircraft without sufficient power to clear high ground.
* On 31 October 1950, Vickers Viking 1B G-AHPN &quot;Lord St Vincent&quot; crashed in bad weather and poor visibility at London Airport after the aircraft struck the runway and went off the end of the runway and caught fire killing 28 out of 30 passengers and crew
* On 5 January 1953, Vickers Viking 1B G-AJDL &quot;Lord St Vincent&quot; crashed on approach to Belfast Nutts Corner Airport due to pilot error, killing 27 out of 35 on board.
* On 12 August 1953, Vickers Viking 1B G-AIVG landed wheels-up after a landing gear tire blew out, all on board survived. Although the aircraft was written off and withdrawn from use, it was moved to the Mus√©e National de L&#x27;automobile de Mulhouse around 1970 and then moved to EuroAirport for restoration in 2004.
* On 20 January 1956, Vickers Viscount 701 G-AMOM crashed on takeoff from Blackbushe Airport on a training flight due to a loss of power in two engines; all five crew on board survived, but the aircraft was written off. The training captain was simulating a number four engine failure and had pulled the high pressure cock on the number three engine by mistake and throttled back the number four engine, causing a loss of power in both engines three and four.
* On 14 March 1957, Flight 411, a Vickers Viscount 701 (G-ALWE, &quot;RMA Discovery&quot;), crashed on approach to Manchester Airport due to a flap failure caused by metal fatigue. All 20 occupants on board died along with two on the ground. A bolt that held the bottom of the number two starboard flap unit broke, causing the aileron to become locked; this led to a loss of control.
* On 28 September 1957, de Havilland Heron 1B G-AOFY, while operating a flight for the Scottish Air Ambulance Service, crashed on approach to Port Ellen/Glenegedale Airport, Islay, in bad weather. The three occupants, two crew and one nurse (a volunteer from Glasgow&#x27;s Southern General Hospital) were killed. One of the remaining two Herons was named &quot;Sister Jean Kennedy&quot; after the nurse; the other after James Young Simpson, a Scottish pioneer in anaesthetics.
* On 23 October 1957, Vickers Viscount 802 G-AOJA on a flight from Heathrow Airport crashed after overshooting on approach to Belfast Nutts Corner Airport, killing all seven on board; the cause was not determined.
* On 17 November 1957, Vickers Viscount 802 G-AOHP crashed at Ballerup, Denmark, after the failure of three engines on approach to Copenhagen Airport. Both crew members survived. (There were no passengers on board the aircraft as this was an all-cargo flight.) The cause was a malfunction of the anti-icing system on the aircraft.
* On 6 February 1958, Flight 609 crashed in a blizzard on its third attempt to take off from an icy runway at the Munich Riem Airport in Germany. On board the plane was the Manchester United football team, along with supporters and journalists. Twenty-three of the 43 passengers died. The accident is known as the &quot;Munich Air Disaster&quot;. The charter flight was operated by Airspeed Ambassador 2 G-ALZU, &quot;Lord Burleigh&quot;.
* On 28 April 1958, Vickers Viscount 802 G-AORC crashed at Craigie, South Ayrshire on approach to Glasgow Prestwick Airport when the pilot misread the altimeter by a margin of . All five occupants on board survived.
* On 16 May 1958, Douglas Dakota C.3 G-AGHP crashed at Chatenoy, France while flying in a storm as a result of structural failure, killing the crew of three.
* On 22 October 1958, Flight 142, a Vickers Viscount 701C (G-ANHC), was struck by an Italian Air Force F-86E Sabre and crashed at Anzio, Italy with the loss of all 31 on board; the F-86 pilot was able to eject and survived.
* On 5 January 1960, Vickers Viscount 701 G-AMNY was damaged beyond economic repair at Luqa Airport, Malta, when it departed the runway after landing following a loss of hydraulic pressure. Although the aircraft came to rest against the airport&#x27;s control tower, there were no fatalities among the 51 occupants (five crew, 46 passengers).
* On 7 January 1960, Vickers Viscount 802 G-AOHU was damaged beyond economic repair when the nose wheel collapsed on landing at Heathrow Airport due to ATC error. A fire then developed and nearly burnt-out the fuselage. There were no casualties among the 59 people on board.
* On 21 December 1961, British European Airways Flight 226, a de Havilland Comet 4B (G-ARJM) operating on behalf of Cyprus Airways from London to Tel Aviv, stalled and crashed on takeoff from Esenboƒüa Airport, Ankara, Turkey. The aircraft was destroyed in the crash killing 27 of 34 on board. The cause was attributed to a fault with the horizon direction indicator giving the pilot a false indication and therefore leading him to put the aircraft in the wrong attitude. BEA and their underwriters began action in 1969 against the manufacturer of the indicator. The manufacturer stated they would defend the action and show that the cause was the pilot suffering a heart attack and the crew being negligent with flightdeck procedures.
* On 4 July 1965, Armstrong Whitworth Argosy 222 G-ASXL crashed into a hilltop near Piacenza, Italy due to a navigation error. Although the aircraft was destroyed, both pilots survived.
* On 27 October 1965, Vickers Vanguard G-APEE on a flight from Edinburgh crashed onto the runway during an approach in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport due to pilot error. All 36 on board died.
* On 12 October 1967, Cyprus Airways Flight 284 operated by BEA de Havilland Comet 4B G-ARCO on behalf of Cyprus Airways, exploded in mid-air over the Mediterranean and crashed into the sea with the loss of all 66 on board. The explosion was caused by a device under a passenger seat.
* On 4 December 1967, Armstrong Whitworth Argosy 222 G-ASXP crashed on a training flight at Stansted during a simulated engine failure, as a result of loss of control. Although the aircraft caught fire on impact, all three crew members survived.
* On 3 July 1968, Hawker Siddeley Trident 1C G-ARPT was destroyed on the ground at London Heathrow when BKS Air Transport Airspeed Ambassador G-AMAD crashed at the airport. The Ambassador&#x27;s impact cut the stationary Trident in half and severed the tailfin of another Trident parked next to it. While this made G-ARPT a complete write-off, the aircraft next to it, Trident 1C G-ARPI, was subsequently repaired and re-entered service. (The latter aircraft would be involved in the worst accident in BEA&#x27;s history as well as the worst involving a Trident, in terms of fatalities, on 18 June 1972.) As at the time of the accident both Tridents were empty and not being attended to while parked on the airport ramp, no BEA passengers or staff were among the fatalities.
* On 2 October 1971, Flight 706, a Vickers Vanguard (G-APEC), crashed near Aarsele, Belgium, following a mid-air rupture of the rear pressure bulkhead due to severe, undetected corrosion. All 63 on board died.
* On 18 June 1972, Flight 548, a Hawker Siddeley Trident 1C (G-ARPI), the aircraft that had been repaired and returned to service after being struck by BKS Air Transport Ambassador G-AMAD at Heathrow on 3 July 1968, crashed two minutes after takeoff from Heathrow Airport, killing all 118 passengers and crew. The accident occurred close to the town of Staines, Middlesex. This was the worst accident in BEA&#x27;s history as well as the worst involving a Trident, in terms of fatalities. It was also the worst on British soil until 1988.
* On 19 January 1973, Vickers Viscount 802 G-AOHI crashed into Ben More, Perthshire while on a test flight. All four people on board were killed.

==Liveries==

===Late-1940s ‚Äì early-1950s===

BEA&#x27;s early liveries in the late-1940s to early-1950s mainly consisted of a bare metal finish with upper case, black &quot;British European Airways&quot; titles above the cabin windows on each side of the fuselage, the aircraft registration in bold, black capital letters on each side of the rear fuselage as well as on the underside of each wing, and a contemporary BEA logo on each side of the forward fuselage featuring a stylised wing and &quot;BEA&quot; in capital letters on each side of the nose. Additionally, Vikings featured a name given to individual aircraft in black capital letters each side of the nose.

===Early-1950s ‚Äì late-1950s===

By the early-1950s, the bare metal finish on most BEA aircraft had evolved to incorporate a burgundy cheatline separated by two thin, white lines above the cabin windows on each side of the fuselage. This cheatline was in turn separated by upper case, burgundy &quot;British European Airways&quot; titles in the middle. The bottom, burgundy part of this cheatline extended below the flightdeck windows to converge on the nose, with the space in-between painted black (matte finish) to reduce glare for the pilots and shield sensitive navigational equipment housed in the nose from radiation. There was a contemporary BEA logo on each side of the forward fuselage featuring a stylised wing and &quot;BEA&quot; in capital letters on each side of the nose. In addition to the aircraft registration, there was also a coat of arms on each side of the rear fuselage and a small Union flag each side of the lower part of the tail. The letters &quot;BEA&quot; appeared in bold, upper case on the upper left and lower right wing while the aircraft registration appeared in bold, upper case on the upper right and lower left wing. Later adaptations of this livery used on DC-3s/Pionairs featured an unbroken cheatline with large, upper case &quot;British European Airways&quot; titles on a white upper fuselage and a larger Union flag, as well as the aircraft registration each side of a white tail and the aircraft&#x27;s name prominently displayed in a white field on the left side of the nose and a coat of arms on its right side. When applied to BEA&#x27;s Elizabethans, this lacked &quot;British European Airways&quot; titles due to the aircraft&#x27;s high-wing configuration that left insufficient space on the upper fuselage.

===Late-1950s ‚Äì late-1960s===

From the late-1950s to the late-1960s, BEA&#x27;s aircraft wore its red, black and white livery, which was uniformly applied to the entire fleet from September 1959. It consisted of a prominent BEA logo featuring the three-letter abbreviation of the airline&#x27;s name in upper case white in a red square each side of a white tail as well as near the front and rear passenger doors on the left fuselage and near the service door[s] on its right side, where it interrupted an otherwise continuous, thick black cheatline across the cabin windows on each side of the fuselage. The cheatlines on each side of the fuselage converged on the nose, with the space in-between painted black (matte finish) as well to reduce glare for the pilots and shield sensitive navigational equipment housed in the nose from radiation. The upper part of the fuselage (above the thick black cheatline) was all-white while its lower part (below the thick black cheatline) was in natural metal finish or painted light-grey. The engines retained their natural metal finish as well while the wings were red, both on the upper and underside, with the BEA logo featuring the three-letter abbreviation of the airline&#x27;s name in upper case white in a square appearing on each wing&#x27;s upper side and the aircraft registration in bold, white capital letters on each wing&#x27;s underside. This livery, which was also known as the &quot;red square&quot; livery because of its prominent display of the red-square BEA logo in multiple locations on the aircraft, featured the Union flag near the front passenger door on the silver/light-grey lower fuselage. It furthermore had the aircraft type on/near both front passenger/forward service doors in white letters on a black background (cheatline) and the aircraft registration in white capital letters on a black background each side of the tail (a thin, black horizontal strip at/near the top of the fin).

===Late-1960s ‚Äì mid-1970s===

From the late-1960s, BEA&#x27;s aircraft began to appear in the &quot;Speedjack&quot; livery. This was the airline&#x27;s final livery. Like the previous red, black and white livery, it was uniformly applied to its entire fleet. It consisted of a dark-blue cheatline across the cabin windows on each side of the fuselage, extending in a straight line from the flightdeck windows to the tail cone/tail engine exhaust/auxiliary power unit exhaust. The upper part of the fuselage (above the dark-blue cheatline) was all-white while its lower part (below the dark-blue cheatline) was light-grey. Unlike the earlier [predominantly] bare metal/white tail, liveries worn by BEA aircraft, the new livery featured a dark-blue tail with a prominent display of part of the Union flag in the shape of an arrow that symbolised an aircraft (composed of a fuselage with swept wings) on each side. The arrow-shaped part of the Union flag symbolising an aircraft became known as the &quot;Speedjack&quot; motif. Tridents wearing this livery also displayed the type&#x27;s name (&quot;Trident&quot; for Trident 1C/1E, &quot;Trident Two&quot; for Trident 2E and &quot;Trident Three&quot; for Trident 3B) in white letters each side of the dark-blue centre engine while One-Eleven 500s wearing it displayed the type&#x27;s name (&quot;Super one-eleven&quot;) in white letters on a dark-blue horizontal strip on each of their bare metal engines. This livery furthermore differed from its two immediate predecessors by only having the tip of the nose cone painted black (matte finish). All aircraft wearing this livery also featured the three-letter abbreviation of the airline&#x27;s name in upper case white framed with a red border to emphasise the shape of the letters, which appeared above the dark-blue cheatline near the passenger/forward service doors each side of the white upper fuselage. In the case of regional feeder aircraft, the three-letter abbreviation of the airline&#x27;s name was followed by the respective operating division&#x27;s name in lower case dark-blue letters (e.g. &quot;scottish airways&quot;). The only aspect of the previous livery that was retained for all mainline aircraft were the red wings (both upper and undersides), with the aircraft registration in bold, white capital letters on each wing&#x27;s underside. Following the merger with BOAC, many former BEA aircraft retained their basic &quot;Speedjack&quot; livery with just the name changing from red-framed, white &quot;BEA&quot; to dark-blue &quot;British airways&quot; pending repainting in the red, white and blue 1970s and early-80s Negus &amp; Negus livery of British Airways.

==City centre check-in facilities==

Following BEA&#x27;s formation, its first Central London air terminal at which check-in facilities for passengers and baggage were available was located close to Victoria station. Before World War II, this facility had been used by Imperial Airways. When wartime restrictions on civil aviation in the UK were lifted, BEA began sharing it with BOAC. Once passengers had checked-in, they boarded one of the Commer Commando buses the airline provided to take them to Northolt. These 1¬Ω-deckers featured a raised seating area at the back, which increased the baggage space below.

On 31 May 1948, BEA moved its Central London check-in to Kensington Air Station, the first purpose-built facility for the exclusive use of BEA&#x27;s passengers.

From 1952, BEA introduced new AEC Regal IV 1¬Ω-decker buses to carry its passengers from Central London to Northolt and Heathrow. London Transport operated these on BEA&#x27;s behalf, in white/grey (later white/blue) livery.

In late 1953, BEA&#x27;s Central London air terminal was moved again to a new site the Waterloo Air Terminal at next to Waterloo station on the south bank of the River Thames between the Houses of Parliament and the City of London. The Heathrow bus journey was now 20 minutes longer but an optional, more expensive, helicopter link was briefly operated from a South Bank helipad.
On 6 October 1957, BEA relocated its Central London air terminal once more to the West London Air Terminal in Cromwell Road in London&#x27;s Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. This was a new, ¬£5 million facility that was officially inaugurated upon completion in 1963.

In 1966, BEA introduced a fleet of double-decker London AEC Routemaster buses. These initially wore a blue and white livery, before being repainted in a white/grey livery, a white/blue livery incorporating BEA&#x27;s &quot;red square&quot; logo and, finally, a white/red livery with Speedjack-style BEA lettering. The London Routemasters carried BEA&#x27;s passengers from the West London Air Terminal to Heathrow and towed their baggage in large, two-wheeled trailers.

In 1974, British Airways withdrew the Central London check-in facilities it had inherited from BEA because of declining demand and closed the West London Air Terminal. This resulted in disposal of the dedicated fleet of Routemaster buses, some of which had already been repainted in the new red, white and blue Negus &amp; Negus livery of British Airways.

==Reuse of name==
Between June 2000 and July 2002, independent UK regional airline Jersey European Airways (JEA) revived the by then long-dormant &quot;British European&quot; name by adopting it as its new trading name to reflect JEA&#x27;s UK-wide expansion and growing partnership with Air France. This also included the prefixing of all JEA flights with the former BEA two-letter, IATA airline identification code BE, which continued in use when JEA rebranded as &quot;Flybe&quot; on 18 July 2002.

<doc id="331253" wikidata="Q2606635" url="?curid=331253" title="Le Rire">
<text>Le Rire (, &quot;Laughter&quot;) was a successful French humor magazine published from October 1894 until its final issue in April 1971. Founded in Paris during the Belle √âpoque by Felix Juven, &quot;Le Rire&quot; appeared as typical Parisians began to achieve more education, income and leisure time. Interest in the arts, culture and politics intensified during the Gay Nineties. Publications like this helped satisfy such curiosity. It was the most successful of all the &quot;Journaux Humoristiques.&quot;

The Dreyfus Affair occurred in 1894 and &quot;Le Rire&quot; was one of many publications to tap anti-Republican sentiment in wake of that scandal. It was a time in which French governance was frequently characterized by corruption and mismanagement. Government ministers and military officials became frequent targets. 

The satirical journal was filled with excellent drawings by prominent artists. It featured full-page chromotypographs on both covers and in the centerfold. Many of these pieces are now highly desirable collectibles. The most prominent contributor was Th√©ophile Steinlen. His illustrations were biting caricatures of the political &quot;jackasses&quot; of the day. Illustrations were contributed by artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Goursat, Ren√© Georges Hermann-Paul, Juan Gris, Lucien Metivet, Georges Meunier, Jean-Louis Forain, Adolphe Willette, Joaqu√≠n Xaudar√≥, Leonetto Cappiello, Albert Guillaume, Manuel Luque, Jules Grandjouan, Abel Faivre, and Jules-Alexandre Grun.

During the music hall era, cabarets and cafes were crowded with personalities and Parisians could catch glimpses of the stars of the day. &quot;Le Rire&quot; was there to capture scene for its readers. Its pages depicted the likes of Yvette Guilbert, Polaire, Jane Avril, R√©jane and even those of popular visitors to the theaters such as S√©verine.

The magazine was published for almost sixty years, closing down in the 1950s and later reappearing for a short time in the 1970s.

<doc id="331256" wikidata="Q365909" url="?curid=331256" title="Thomas Bartholin">
<text>Thomas Bartholin (; Latinized as &quot;Thomas Bartholinus&quot;; 20 October 1616¬†‚Äì 4 December 1680) was a Danish physician, mathematician, and theologian. He discovered the lymphatic system in humans and advanced the theory of refrigeration anesthesia, being the first to describe it scientifically.

Thomas Bartholin came from a family that has become famous for its pioneering scientists, twelve of whom became professors at the University of Copenhagen. Three generations of the Bartholin family made significant contributions to anatomical science and medicine in the 17th and 18th centuries: Thomas Bartholin&#x27;s father, Caspar Bartholin the Elder (1585‚Äì1629), his brother Rasmus Bartholin (1625‚Äì1698), and his son Caspar Bartholin the Younger (1655‚Äì1738). Thomas Bartholin&#x27;s son (1659‚Äì1690) became a professor of history at the University of Copenhagen and was later appointed royal antiquarian and secretary to the Royal Archives.

== Personal life ==
Thomas Bartholin was the second of the six sons of Caspar Bartholin the Elder, a physician born in Malm√∏, Scania, and his spouse Anne Fincke. Bartholin the Elder published the first collected anatomical work in 1611. This work was later augmented, illustrated and revised by Thomas Bartholin, becoming the standard reference on anatomy; the son notably added updates on William Harvey&#x27;s theory of blood circulation and on the lymphatic system.

Bartholin visited the Italian botanist Pietro Castelli at Messina in 1644. In 1663 Bartholin bought Hagestedg√•rd, which burned down in 1670 including his library, with the loss of many manuscripts. King Christian V of Denmark appointed Bartholin as his physician with a substantial salary and freed the farm from taxation as recompense for the loss. In 1680 Bartholin&#x27;s health failed, the farm was sold, and he moved back to Copenhagen, where he died. He was buried in Vor Frue Kirke (Church of Our Lady).

The &quot;Bartholinsgade&quot;, a street in Copenhagen, is named for the family. Nearby is the Bartholin Institute (&quot;Bartholin Institutet&quot;). One of the buildings of the University of Aarhus is named after him.

== Contributions to medical research ==
In December 1652, Bartholin published the first full description of the human lymphatic system. Jean Pecquet had previously noted the lymphatic system in animals in 1651, and Pecquet&#x27;s discovery of the thoracic duct and its entry into the veins made him the first person to describe the correct route of the lymphatic fluid into the blood. Shortly after the publication of Pecquet&#x27;s and Bartholin&#x27;s findings, a similar discovery of the human lymphatic system was published by Olof Rudbeck in 1653, although Rudbeck had presented his findings at the court of Queen Christina of Sweden in April‚ÄìMay 1652, before Bartholin, but delayed in writing about it until 1653 (after Bartholin). As a result, an intense priority dispute ensued. Niels Stensen or Steno became Bartholin&#x27;s most famous pupil.

Thomas&#x27; publication &quot;De nivis usu medico observationes variae&quot; Chapter XXII, contains the first known mention of refrigeration anaesthesia, a technique whose invention Thomas Bartholin credits to the Italian Marco Aurelio Severino of Naples. According to Bartholin, Severino was the first to present the use of freezing mixtures of snow and ice (1646), and Thomas Bartholin initially learnt about the technique from him during a visit to Naples.

Bartholin‚ÄìPatau syndrome, a congenital syndrome of multiple abnormalities produced by trisomy 13, was first described by Bartholin in 1656.

Caspar Bartholin the Elder, Thomas Bartholin&#x27;s father; his brother Rasmus Bartholin; and his son Caspar Bartholin the Younger (who first described &quot;Bartholin&#x27;s glands&quot;), all contributed to the practice of modern medicine through their discoveries of important anatomical structures and phenomena. Bartholin the Elder started his tenure as professor at Copenhagen University in 1613, and over the next 125 years, the scientific accomplishments of the Bartholins while serving on the medical faculty of the University of Copenhagen won international acclaim and contributed to the reputation of the institution.

<doc id="331258" wikidata="Q43219517" url="?curid=331258" title="Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse">
<text>In mathematics, and in particular linear algebra, the Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse of a matrix , often called the pseudoinverse, is the most widely known generalization of the inverse matrix. It was independently described by E. H. Moore in 1920, Arne Bjerhammar in 1951, and Roger Penrose in 1955. Earlier, Erik Ivar Fredholm had introduced the concept of a pseudoinverse of integral operators in 1903. The terms &quot;pseudoinverse&quot; and &quot;generalized inverse&quot; are sometimes used as synonyms for the Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse of a matrix, but sometimes applied to other elements of algebraic structures which share some but not all properties expected for an inverse element.

A common use of the pseudoinverse is to compute a &quot;best fit&quot; (least squares) approximate solution to a system of linear equations that lacks an exact solution (see below under ¬ß Applications).
Another use is to find the minimum (Euclidean) norm solution to a system of linear equations with multiple solutions. The pseudoinverse facilitates the statement and proof of results in linear algebra.

The pseudoinverse is defined for all rectangular matrices whose entries are real or complex numbers. Given a rectangular matrix with real or complex entries, its pseudoinverse is unique. 
It can be computed using the singular value decomposition. In the special case where is a normal matrix (for example, a Hermitian matrix), the pseudoinverse annihilates the kernel of and acts as a traditional inverse of on the subspace orthogonal to the kernel.

==Notation==
In the following discussion, the following conventions are adopted.

* will denote one of the fields of real or complex numbers, denoted , , respectively. The vector space of matrices over is denoted by .
* For , the transpose is denoted and the Hermitian transpose (also called conjugate transpose) is denoted . If formula_1, then formula_2.
* For , (standing for &quot;range&quot;) denotes the column space (image) of (the space spanned by the column vectors of ) and denotes the kernel (null space) of .
* For any positive integer , the identity matrix is denoted .

==Definition==
For formula_3, a pseudoinverse of is defined as a matrix satisfying all of the following four criteria, known as the Moore‚ÄìPenrose conditions:
# need not be the general identity matrix, but it maps all column vectors of to themselves: formula_4
# acts like a weak inverse: formula_5
# is Hermitian: formula_6
# is also Hermitian: formula_7

Note that formula_8 and formula_9 are idempotent operators, as follows from formula_10 and formula_11. More specifically, formula_8 projects onto the image of formula_13 (equivalently, the span of the rows of formula_14), and formula_9 projects onto the image of formula_14 (equivalently, the span of the columns of formula_14). In fact, the above four conditions are fully equivalent to formula_8 and formula_9 being such orthogonal projections: formula_9 projecting onto the image of formula_14 implies formula_22, and formula_8 projecting onto the image of formula_13 implies formula_25.

The pseudoinverse formula_26 exists for any matrix formula_3. If furthermore formula_14 is full rank, that is, its rank is , then can be given a particularly simple algebraic expression. In particular:

* When has linearly independent columns (equivalently, is injective, and thus is invertible), can be computed asformula_29This particular pseudoinverse is a &quot;left inverse&quot;, that is, formula_30.
* If, on the other hand, formula_14 has linearly independent rows (equivalently, formula_14 is surjective, and thus is invertible), can be computed asformula_33This is a &quot;right inverse&quot;, as formula_34.

In the more general case, the pseudoinverse can be expressed leveraging the singular value decomposition. Any matrix can be decomposed as formula_35 for some isometries formula_36 and diagonal nonnegative real matrix formula_37. The pseudoinverse can then be written as formula_38, where formula_39 is the pseudoinverse of formula_37 and can be obtained by transposing the matrix and replacing the nonzero values with their multiplicative inverses. That this matrix satisfies the above requirement is directly verified observing that formula_41 and formula_42, which are the projections onto image and support of formula_14, respectively.

==Properties==

===Existence and uniqueness===
As discussed above, for any matrix there is one and only one pseudoinverse .

A matrix satisfying only the first of the conditions given above, namely formula_44, is known as a generalized inverse. If the matrix also satisfies the second condition, namely formula_45, it is called a generalized &quot;reflexive&quot; inverse. Generalized inverses always exist but are not in general unique. Uniqueness is a consequence of the last two conditions.

===Basic properties===
Proofs for the properties below can be found at .
* If has real entries, then so does .
* If is invertible, its pseudoinverse is its inverse. That is, formula_46.
* The pseudoinverse of the pseudoinverse is the original matrix: formula_47.
* Pseudoinversion commutes with transposition, complex conjugation, and taking the conjugate transpose: formula_48
* The pseudoinverse of a scalar multiple of is the reciprocal multiple of :formula_49 for ; otherwise, formula_50, or formula_51.
* The kernel and image of the pseudoinverse coincide with those of the conjugate transpose: formula_52 and formula_53.

====Identities====
The following identity formula can be used to cancel or expand certain subexpressions involving pseudoinverses:
formula_54
Equivalently, substituting formula_26 for formula_14 gives
formula_57
while substituting formula_58 for formula_14 gives
formula_60

===Reduction to Hermitian case===
The computation of the pseudoinverse is reducible to its construction in the Hermitian case. This is possible through the equivalences:
formula_61
formula_62

as and are Hermitian.

===Pseudoinverse of products===

The equality does not hold in general. Rather, suppose . Then the following are equivalent:

# formula_63
# formula_64 and formula_65
# formula_66 and formula_67
# formula_68
# formula_69 and formula_70.

The following are sufficient conditions for :
# has orthonormal columns (then formula_71), or
# has orthonormal rows (then formula_72), or
# has linearly independent columns (then formula_73 ) and has linearly independent rows (then formula_74), ¬† or
# formula_75, or
# formula_76.

The following is a necessary condition for :
# formula_77

The fourth sufficient condition yields the equalities
formula_78

Here is a counterexample where :

formula_79

===Projectors===
formula_80 and formula_81 are orthogonal projection operators, that is, they are Hermitian (formula_82, formula_83) and idempotent (formula_84 and formula_85). The following hold:
* formula_86 and formula_87
* is the orthogonal projector onto the range of (which equals the orthogonal complement of the kernel of ).
* is the orthogonal projector onto the range of (which equals the orthogonal complement of the kernel of ).
* formula_88 is the orthogonal projector onto the kernel of .
* formula_89 is the orthogonal projector onto the kernel of .

The last two properties imply the following identities:
* formula_90
* formula_91

Another property is the following: if is Hermitian and idempotent (true if and only if it represents an orthogonal projection), then, for any matrix the following equation holds:
formula_92

This can be proven by defining matrices formula_93, formula_94, and checking that is indeed a pseudoinverse for by verifying that the defining properties of the pseudoinverse hold, when is Hermitian and idempotent.

From the last property it follows that, if is Hermitian and idempotent, for any matrix 
formula_95

Finally, if is an orthogonal projection matrix, then its pseudoinverse trivially coincides with the matrix itself, that is, formula_96.

===Geometric construction===
If we view the matrix as a linear map over the field then can be decomposed as follows. We write for the direct sum, for the orthogonal complement, for the kernel of a map, and for the image of a map. Notice that formula_97 and formula_98. The restriction formula_99 is then an isomorphism. This implies that on is the inverse of this isomorphism, and is zero on formula_100

In other words: To find for given in , first project orthogonally onto the range of , finding a point in the range. Then form , that is, find those vectors in that sends to . This will be an affine subspace of parallel to the kernel of . The element of this subspace that has the smallest length (that is, is closest to the origin) is the answer we are looking for. It can be found by taking an arbitrary member of and projecting it orthogonally onto the orthogonal complement of the kernel of .

This description is closely related to the minimum-norm solution to a linear system.

===Limit relations===
The pseudoinverse are limits:
formula_101
(see Tikhonov regularization). These limits exist even if or do not exist.

===Continuity===
In contrast to ordinary matrix inversion, the process of taking pseudoinverses is not continuous: if the sequence converges to the matrix (in the maximum norm or Frobenius norm, say), then need not converge to . However, if all the matrices have the same rank as , will converge to .

===Derivative===
Let formula_102 be a real-valued differentiable matrix function with constant rank at a point .
The derivative of formula_103 at formula_104 may be calculated in terms of the derivative of formula_14 at formula_104: 
formula_107
where the functions formula_14, formula_26 and derivatives on the right side are evaluated at formula_104 (that is, formula_111, formula_112, etc.). 
For a complex matrix, the transpose is replaced with the conjugate transpose. For a real-valued symmetric matrix, the Magnus-Neudecker derivative is established.

==Examples==
Since for invertible matrices the pseudoinverse equals the usual inverse, only examples of non-invertible matrices are considered below.

* For formula_113 the pseudoinverse is formula_114 The uniqueness of this pseudoinverse can be seen from the requirement formula_115, since multiplication by a zero matrix would always produce a zero matrix.
* For formula_116 the pseudoinverse is formula_117.
: Indeed, formula_118, and thus formula_119. Similarly, formula_120, and thus formula_121.
: Note that is neither injective nor surjective, and thus the pseudoinverse cannot be computed via formula_122 nor formula_123, as formula_124 and formula_125 are both singular, and furthermore formula_26 is neither a left nor a right inverse.
: Nonetheless, the pseudoinverse can be computed via SVD observing that formula_127, and thus formula_128.
* For formula_129 formula_130
* For formula_131 formula_132. The denominators are here formula_133.
* For formula_134 formula_135
* For formula_136 the pseudoinverse is formula_137.
: For this matrix, the left inverse exists and thus equals formula_26, indeed, formula_139
==Special cases==
===Scalars===
It is also possible to define a pseudoinverse for scalars and vectors. This amounts to treating these as matrices. The pseudoinverse of a scalar is zero if is zero and the reciprocal of otherwise:
formula_140

===Vectors===
The pseudoinverse of the null (all zero) vector is the transposed null vector. The pseudoinverse of a non-null vector is the conjugate transposed vector divided by its squared magnitude:

formula_141

=== Diagonal matrices ===
The pseudoinverse of a squared diagonal matrix is obtained by taking the reciprocal of the nonzero diagonal elements. Formally, if formula_37 is a squared diagonal matrix with formula_143 and formula_144, then formula_145. More generally, if formula_14 is any formula_147 rectangular matrix whose only nonzero elements are on the diagonal, meaning formula_148, formula_149, then formula_26 is a formula_151 rectangular matrix whose diagonal elements are the reciprocal of the original ones, that is, formula_152.

===Linearly independent columns===
If the rank of is identical to the number of columns, , (for ,) there are linearly independent columns, and is invertible. In this case, an explicit formula is:
formula_153

It follows that is then a left inverse of : ¬† formula_154.

===Linearly independent rows===
If the rank of is identical to the number of rows, , (for ,) there are linearly independent rows, and is invertible. In this case, an explicit formula is:
formula_155

It follows that is a right inverse of : ¬† formula_156.

===Orthonormal columns or rows===
This is a special case of either full column rank or full row rank (treated above). If has orthonormal columns (formula_157) or orthonormal rows (formula_158), then:
formula_159

=== Normal matrices ===
If is normal, that is, it commutes with its conjugate transpose, then its pseudoinverse can be computed by diagonalizing it, mapping all nonzero eigenvalues to their inverses, and mapping zero eigenvalues to zero. A corollary is that commuting with its transpose implies that it commutes with its pseudoinverse.

=== EP matrices ===
A (square) matrix is said to be an EP matrix if it commutes with its pseudoinverse. In such cases (and only in such cases), it is possible to obtain the pseudoinverse as a polynomial in . A polynomial formula_160 such that formula_161 can be easily obtained from the characteristic polynomial of or, more generally, from any annihilating polynomial of .

===Orthogonal projection matrices===
This is a special case of a normal matrix with eigenvalues 0 and 1. If is an orthogonal projection matrix, that is, formula_162 and formula_163, then the pseudoinverse trivially coincides with the matrix itself:
formula_164

===Circulant matrices===
For a circulant matrix , the singular value decomposition is given by the Fourier transform, that is, the singular values are the Fourier coefficients. Let be the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix; then
formula_165

==Construction==
===Rank decomposition===
Let denote the rank of . Then can be (rank) decomposed as
formula_166 where and are of rank . Then formula_167.

===The QR method===
For formula_168 computing the product or and their inverses explicitly is often a source of numerical rounding errors and computational cost in practice. An alternative approach using the QR decomposition of may be used instead.

Consider the case when is of full column rank, so that formula_169. Then the Cholesky decomposition formula_170, where is an upper triangular matrix, may be used. Multiplication by the inverse is then done easily by solving a system with multiple right-hand sides,
formula_171

which may be solved by forward substitution followed by back substitution.

The Cholesky decomposition may be computed without forming explicitly, by alternatively using the QR decomposition of formula_172, where formula_173 has orthonormal columns, formula_174, and is upper triangular. Then
formula_175

so is the Cholesky factor of .

The case of full row rank is treated similarly by using the formula formula_176 and using a similar argument, swapping the roles of and .

===Using polynomials in matrices===
For an arbitrary , one has that formula_177 is normal and, as a consequence, an EP matrix. One can then find a polynomial formula_160 such that formula_179. In this case one has that the pseudoinverse of is given by
formula_180

===Singular value decomposition (SVD)===
A computationally simple and accurate way to compute the pseudoinverse is by using the singular value decomposition. If formula_181 is the singular value decomposition of , then formula_182. For a rectangular diagonal matrix such as , we get the pseudoinverse by taking the reciprocal of each non-zero element on the diagonal, leaving the zeros in place. In numerical computation, only elements larger than some small tolerance are taken to be nonzero, and the others are replaced by zeros. For example, in the MATLAB or GNU Octave function , the tolerance is taken to be , where Œµ is the machine epsilon.

The computational cost of this method is dominated by the cost of computing the SVD, which is several times higher than matrix‚Äìmatrix multiplication, even if a state-of-the art implementation (such as that of LAPACK) is used.

The above procedure shows why taking the pseudoinverse is not a continuous operation: if the original matrix has a singular value 0 (a diagonal entry of the matrix above), then modifying slightly may turn this zero into a tiny positive number, thereby affecting the pseudoinverse dramatically as we now have to take the reciprocal of a tiny number.

===Block matrices===
Optimized approaches exist for calculating the pseudoinverse of block-structured matrices.

===The iterative method of Ben-Israel and Cohen===
Another method for computing the pseudoinverse (cf. Drazin inverse) uses the recursion
formula_183

which is sometimes referred to as hyper-power sequence. This recursion produces a sequence converging quadratically to the pseudoinverse of if it is started with an appropriate satisfying formula_184. The choice formula_185 (where formula_186, with denoting the largest singular value of ) has been argued not to be competitive to the method using the SVD mentioned above, because even for moderately ill-conditioned matrices it takes a long time before enters the region of quadratic convergence. However, if started with already close to the Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse and formula_184, for example formula_188, convergence is fast (quadratic).

===Updating the pseudoinverse===
For the cases where has full row or column rank, and the inverse of the correlation matrix ( for with full row rank or for full column rank) is already known, the pseudoinverse for matrices related to can be computed by applying the Sherman‚ÄìMorrison‚ÄìWoodbury formula to update the inverse of the correlation matrix, which may need less work. In particular, if the related matrix differs from the original one by only a changed, added or deleted row or column, incremental algorithms exist that exploit the relationship.

Similarly, it is possible to update the Cholesky factor when a row or column is added, without creating the inverse of the correlation matrix explicitly. However, updating the pseudoinverse in the general rank-deficient case is much more complicated.

===Software libraries===
High-quality implementations of SVD, QR, and back substitution are available in standard libraries, such as LAPACK. Writing one&#x27;s own implementation of SVD is a major programming project that requires a significant numerical expertise. In special circumstances, such as parallel computing or embedded computing, however, alternative implementations by QR or even the use of an explicit inverse might be preferable, and custom implementations may be unavoidable.

The Python package NumPy provides a pseudoinverse calculation through its functions codice_1 and codice_2; its codice_3 uses the SVD-based algorithm. SciPy adds a function codice_4 that uses a least-squares solver. 

The MASS package for R provides a calculation of the Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse through the codice_5 function. The codice_5 function calculates a pseudoinverse using the singular value decomposition provided by the codice_7 function in the base R package. An alternative is to employ the codice_3 function available in the pracma package.

The Octave programming language provides a pseudoinverse through the standard package function codice_3 and the codice_10 method.

In Julia (programming language), the LinearAlgebra package of the standard library provides an implementation of the Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse codice_11 implemented via singular-value decomposition.

==Applications==
===Linear least-squares===
The pseudoinverse provides a least squares solution to a system of linear equations.
For , given a system of linear equations
formula_189

in general, a vector that solves the system may not exist, or if one does exist, it may not be unique. More specifically, a solution exists if and only if formula_190 is in the image of formula_14, and is unique if and only if formula_14 is injective. The pseudoinverse solves the &quot;least-squares&quot; problem as follows:

* , we have formula_193 where formula_194 and formula_195 denotes the Euclidean norm. This weak inequality holds with equality if and only if formula_196 for any vector ; this provides an infinitude of minimizing solutions unless has full column rank, in which case is a zero matrix. The solution with minimum Euclidean norm is 

This result is easily extended to systems with multiple right-hand sides, when the Euclidean norm is replaced by the Frobenius norm. Let .

* , we have formula_197 where formula_198 and formula_199 denotes the Frobenius norm.

===Obtaining all solutions of a linear system===
If the linear system

formula_200

has any solutions, they are all given by

formula_201

for arbitrary vector . Solution(s) exist if and only if formula_202. If the latter holds, then the solution is unique if and only if has full column rank, in which case is a zero matrix. If solutions exist but does not have full column rank, then we have an indeterminate system, all of whose infinitude of solutions are given by this last equation.

===Minimum norm solution to a linear system===
For linear systems formula_203 with non-unique solutions (such as under-determined systems), the pseudoinverse may be used to construct the solution of minimum Euclidean norm
formula_204 among all solutions.

* If formula_205 is satisfiable, the vector formula_194 is a solution, and satisfies formula_207 for all solutions.

This result is easily extended to systems with multiple right-hand sides, when the Euclidean norm is replaced by the Frobenius norm. Let .

* If formula_208 is satisfiable, the matrix formula_198 is a solution, and satisfies formula_210 for all solutions.

===Condition number===
Using the pseudoinverse and a matrix norm, one can define a condition number for any matrix:
formula_211

A large condition number implies that the problem of finding least-squares solutions to the corresponding system of linear equations is ill-conditioned in the sense that small errors in the entries of can lead to huge errors in the entries of the solution.

==Generalizations==
The weighted pseudoinverse generalizes the Moore-Penrose inverse between metric spaces with weight matrices in the domain and range. These weights are the identity for the standard Moore-Penrose inverse, which assumes an orthonormal basis in both spaces. 

In order to solve more general least-squares problems, one can define Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverses for all continuous linear operators between two Hilbert spaces and , using the same four conditions as in our definition above. It turns out that not every continuous linear operator has a continuous linear pseudoinverse in this sense. Those that do are precisely the ones whose range is closed in .

A notion of pseudoinverse exists for matrices over an arbitrary field equipped with an arbitrary involutive automorphism. In this more general setting, a given matrix doesn&#x27;t always have a pseudoinverse. The necessary and sufficient condition for a pseudoinverse to exist is that formula_212, where formula_58 denotes the result of applying the involution operation to the transpose of formula_14. When it does exist, it is unique. Example: Consider the field of complex numbers equipped with the identity involution (as opposed to the involution considered elsewhere in the article); do there exist matrices that fail to have pseudoinverses in this sense? Consider the matrix formula_215. Observe that formula_216 while formula_217. So this matrix doesn&#x27;t have a pseudoinverse in this sense.

In abstract algebra, a Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse may be defined on a *-regular semigroup. This abstract definition coincides with the one in linear algebra.

<doc id="331267" wikidata="Q464230" url="?curid=331267" title="Marin Barleti">
<text>Marin Barleti (, ; ‚Äì ) was a historian, humanist and Catholic priest from Shkod√´r. He is considered the first Albanian historian because of his 1504 eyewitness account of the 1478 siege of Shkodra. Barleti is better known for his second work, a biography on Skanderbeg, translated into many languages in the 16th to the 20th centuries.

== Life ==
Barleti was born and raised in Scutari (modern Shkodra, Albania), then part of the Republic of Venice. Although there is no debate whether Barleti was a native Shkodran or an Albanian in a geographical sense, and although there is indirect evidence that he considered his mother tongue to be Albanian, alternatively to an Albanian ethnic origin (supported by Zeno, Fallmerayer, Jireƒçek), some scholars have hypothesized an Italian (DuCange, Iorga), or Dalmatian (Giovio, Czwittinger, Fabricius) ethnic origin. In his works Barleti repeatedly calls himself Shkodran (), and then equates being Shkodran with being Epirote, a term used by early Albanian language authors as an equivalent form of the ethnonym &quot;Albanian&quot;. In an early version of the &quot;Siege of Shkodra&quot; which was found in 2018 and published in 2022, Barleti recalls that the local language which in another part he equates with Albanian is the language of his ancestors (&quot;attavorum nostrum&quot;). This is an indirect reference to Albanian being Barleti&#x27;s mother tongue.

According to linguist Eqrem √áabej, Barleti&#x27;s surname can be derived from the original form &quot;Bardheci&quot;, from Albanian &quot;bardh√´&quot; meaning &#x27;white&#x27;, with the suffix -&quot;eci&quot;, through the typical fluctuation between [≈Ç] &lt;ll&gt; and √∞ &lt;dh&gt; that occurs in the dialect of North Geg Albanian, spoken around Shkodra, hence producing the form &quot;Barl(l)eci&quot;. 

In 1474, the Ottoman Empire besieged Shkodra and Barleti participated in the successful defense of the town, both in the first siege in 1474 and the second in 1478. When Shkodra finally fell to the Ottomans in 1479, Barleti escaped to Italy where he would become a scholar of history, classical literature and the Latin language.

Soon after Barleti arrived in Venice, he was given a stall at the Rialto meat market as a temporary means of financial aid. In 1494 became a priest after his theological studies in Venice and Padova, and soon was appointed to serve at St. Stephen&#x27;s Church in Piovene.

== Works ==

=== The Siege of Shkodra ===
Barleti&#x27;s first work was &quot;The Siege of Shkodra&quot; (, Venice, 1504). It was published several times in Latin and translated into Italian, Polish, French, Albanian, and English. Barleti wrote this work as an eyewitness. Of this work, acclaimed Albanian author Ismail Kadare wrote that &quot;if one were to search for a literary creation wholly worthy of the expression &#x27;monumental work,&#x27; it would be hard to find a better example than &quot;The Siege of Shkodra&quot;.&quot; An early version of the final work was found in 2018 and published in 2022.

=== The History of Scanderbeg ===
Barleti&#x27;s second and largest work was &quot;The history of the life and deeds of Scanderbeg, the Prince of Epirus&quot;, () was published in 1504 in Venice, and later in Rome between 1508 and 1510; (2nd ed.: Strasbourg, 1537; 3rd ed.: Frankfurt am Main, 1578; 4th ed.: Zagreb, 1743) and translated into German (1533), Italian (1554), Portuguese (1567), Polish (1569), French (1576), Spanish (1588), and English (1596). Unlike &quot;The Siege of Shkodra&quot;, Barleti relied on the testimonies of others to produce this work. Barleti&#x27;s books were published and printed by Bernardino Vitali in Venice and Rome.

&quot;The History of Scanderbeg&quot; is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness. A traduction of this work of Barleti is in slavonic, in the Cetinje chronicle. A note at the end of this manuscript says, according to Martinovic (1962) that the author of the text is &quot;Marin from Shkod√´r of Slavic origin&quot;.

Paolo Giovio was the first historian to confound Barletius with another contemporary &quot;Marinus Scodrensis&quot;, Marino Becichemi (1468-1526), professor of rhetorics and author of commentaries on classic literature. The confusion has been elucidated by Thomas Reinesius and Apostolo Zeno. While Barletius in his works calls himself &quot;sacerdotis Scodrensis&quot; (priest of Scodra), Becichemi professes himself married and a &quot;father of boys&quot;, professor of Ragusa, Brescia, and Padua, neither of which applies to Barletius.

=== A Brief History of Lives of Popes and Emperors (disputed) ===
Barleti&#x27;s third work is titled, &quot;A Brief History of Lives of Popes and Emperors&quot; (, Venice, 1555).

== Criticism ==
Barletius&#x27; work has inspired chroniclers like Giammaria Biemmi and Theodore Spandounes. It is still popular among romanticist and nationalist historians. Modern historical research on Skenderbeg relies more on archival records than on Barletius.

Barleti invented spurious correspondence between Vladislav II of Wallachia and Skanderbeg, wrongly assigning it to the year 1443 instead to the year of 1444. Barleti also invented correspondence between Scanderbeg and Sultan Mehmed II to match his interpretations of events.

The main public library of Shkodra and a publishing house have been named after Marin Barleti. Also, a university in Tirana, Albania has been established under his name.

<text>Premyer-Ministr (, lit. &quot;Prime minister&quot;) is a Russian musical group. The idea behind the band was to form a boy band, though not especially for teenagers. Four men came together to form Premier Ministr in 1997. Their first real success came in 2000 with the remake of a Russian tune, &quot;Oriental Song&quot;. 

In 2001 one of the members, Dmitry Lanskoy, left the group for a solo career and was replaced.

In 2005, the group members split with their producer and started independent career as Group PM, while Premier Ministr was started anew with Taras Demchuk, Sergey Demyanchuk, Amarkhuu Borkhuu, and Vasily Kireyev.

<doc id="331296" wikidata="Q3529059" url="?curid=331296" title="Timothy C. May">
<text>Timothy C. May, better known as Tim May (December 21, 1951 ‚Äì December 13, 2018) was an American technical and political writer, and electronic engineer and senior scientist at Intel. May was also the founder of the crypto-anarchist movement. He retired from Intel in 1986 at age 35 and died of natural causes at his home on December 13, 2018 at age 66.

==Discovery of alpha particle effects on computer chips==
As an engineer, May was most noted for having identified the cause of the &quot;alpha particle problem&quot;, which was affecting the reliability of integrated circuits as device features reached a critical size where a single alpha particle could change the state of a stored value and cause a single event upset. May realized that the ceramic packaging that Intel was using, made from clay, was very slightly radioactive. Intel solved the issue by increasing the charge in each cell to reduce its susceptibility to radiation and adopting plastic packaging for their products.

May co-authored the 1981 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Award-winning paper &quot;Alpha-Particle-Induced Soft Errors in Dynamic Memories&quot;, published in the IEEE &quot;Transactions on &quot; in January 1979 with Murray H. Woods.

==Social and political views==
May was an advocate for libertarianism and for internet privacy.

He was a founding member of, and had been one of the most voluminous contributors to, the Cypherpunks electronic mailing list. He wrote extensively on cryptography and privacy from the 1990s through 2003.

May wrote a substantial cypherpunk-themed FAQ, &quot;The Cyphernomicon&quot; (incorporating his earlier piece &quot;The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto&quot;); and his essay, &quot;True Nyms and Crypto Anarchy&quot;, was included in a reprint of Vernor Vinge&#x27;s novel &quot;True Names&quot;. In 2001 his work was published in the book, &quot;Crypto Anarchy, Cyberstates, and Pirate Utopias&quot;.

May led a reclusive life. His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary noted: &quot;He often wrote about arming himself and waiting for government agents to show up. After the Cypherpunks faded in the early 2000s, he began expressing racist sentiments to other online groups&quot;.

&quot;Reason Magazine&quot; described him as a &quot;significant influence on both bitcoin and WikiLeaks&quot; in their obituary.

<text>Sestre are a Slovenian drag act that represented Slovenia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. They were among the bookies favourites to win. 

Toma≈æ (Marlenna), Damjan (Emperatrizz) and Sreƒçko (Daphne) had been performing together since 2000 under the name Suspender Sisters with a classic drag queen show program. 
In February 2002, they competed in and won the Slovenian pre-selection and so represented Slovenia on Eurovision 2002 in Tallinn. They placed 13th with 33 points.

In October 2002, they released their first album, &quot;Souvenir&quot; by Menart with the support of a co-operational team Dom Svobode: Magnifico, Barbara Pe≈°ut and Schatzi. The album was recorded in Slovene, but most of the songs are translated in English, Spanish, French and German.

<doc id="331299" wikidata="Q1064441" url="?curid=331299" title="Democratization">
<text>Democratization, or democratisation, is the structural government transition from an authoritarian government to a more democratic political regime, including substantive political changes moving in a democratic direction.

Whether and to what extent democratization occurs can be influenced by various factors, including economic development, historical legacies, civil society, and international processes. Some accounts of democratization emphasize how elites drove democratization, whereas other accounts emphasize grassroots bottom-up processes. How democratization occurs has also been used to explain other political phenomena, such as whether a country goes to a war or whether its economy grows.

The opposite process is known as democratic backsliding or autocratization.

== Description ==
Theories of democratization seek to explain a large macro-level change of a political regime from authoritarianism to democracy. Symptoms of democratization include reform of the electoral system, increased suffrage and reduced political apathy.

=== Measures of democratization ===
Democracy indices enable the quantitative assessment of democratization. Some common democracy indices are Freedom House, Polity data series, V-Dem Democracy indices and Democracy Index. Democracy indices can be quantitative or categorical. Some disagreements among scholars concern the concept of democracy and how to measure democracy ‚Äì and what democracy indices should be used.

=== Waves of democratization ===
One way to summarize the outcome theories of democratization seek to account is with the idea of waves of democratization
A wave of democratization refers to a major surge of democracy in history. And Samuel P. Huntington identified three waves of democratization that have taken place in history. The first one brought democracy to Western Europe and Northern America in the 19th century. It was followed by a rise of dictatorships during the Interwar period. The second wave began after World War II, but lost steam between 1962 and the mid-1970s. The latest wave began in 1974 and is still ongoing. Democratization of Latin America and the former Eastern Bloc is part of this third wave.

Waves of democratization can be followed by waves of de-democratization. Thus, Huntington, in 1991, offered the following depiction.

‚Ä¢¬†First wave of democratization, 1828‚Äì1926

‚Ä¢¬†First wave of de-democratization, 1922‚Äì42

‚Ä¢¬†Second wave of democratization, 1943‚Äì62

‚Ä¢¬†Second wave of de-democratization, 1958‚Äì75

‚Ä¢¬†Third wave of democratization, 1974‚Äì

The idea of waves of democratization has also been used and scrutinized by many other authors, including Renske Doorenspleet, John Markoff, Seva Gunitsky, and Svend-Erik Skaaning.

According to Seva Gunitsky, from the 18th century to the Arab Spring (2011‚Äì2012), 13 democratic waves can be identified.

The V-Dem Democracy Report identified for the year 2023 9 cases of stand-alone democratization in East Timor, The Gambia, Honduras, Fiji, Dominican Republic, Solomon Islands, Montenegro, Seychelles, and Kosovo and 9 cases of U-Turn Democratization in Thailand, Maldives, Tunisia, Bolivia, Zambia, Benin, North Macedonia, Lesotho, and Brazil.

== By country ==

Throughout the history of democracy, enduring democracy advocates succeed almost always through peaceful means when there is a window of opportunity. One major type of opportunity include governments weakened after a violent shock. The other main avenue occurs when autocrats are not threatened by elections, and democratize while retaining power. The path to democracy can be long with setbacks along the way.

=== Athens ===
=== Benin ===
=== Brazil ===
=== Chile ===
=== France ===
The French Revolution (1789) briefly allowed a wide franchise. The French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars lasted for more than twenty years. The French Directory was more oligarchic. The First French Empire and the Bourbon Restoration restored more autocratic rule. The French Second Republic had universal male suffrage but was followed by the Second French Empire. The Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71) resulted in the French Third Republic.

=== Germany ===
Germany established its first democracy in 1919 with the creation of the Weimar Republic, a parliamentary republic created following the German Empire&#x27;s defeat in World War I. The Weimar Republic lasted only 14 years before it collapsed and was replaced by Nazi dictatorship. Historians continue to debate the reasons why the Weimar Republic&#x27;s attempt at democratization failed. After Germany was militarily defeated in World War II, democracy was reestablished in West Germany during the U.S.-led occupation which undertook the denazification of society.

=== United Kingdom ===

In Great Britain, there was renewed interest in Magna Carta in the 17th century. The Parliament of England enacted the Petition of Right in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects. The English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651) was fought between the King and an oligarchic but elected Parliament, during which the idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the Putney Debates of 1647. Subsequently, the Protectorate (1653‚Äì59) and the English Restoration (1660) restored more autocratic rule although Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act in 1679, which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence. The Glorious Revolution in 1688 established a strong Parliament that passed the Bill of Rights 1689, which codified certain rights and liberties for individuals. It set out the requirement for regular parliaments, free elections, rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch, ensuring that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail. Only with the Representation of the People Act 1884 did a majority of the males get the vote.

=== Greece ===
=== Indonesia ===
=== Italy ===

In September 1847, violent riots inspired by Liberals broke out in Reggio Calabria and in Messina in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which were put down by the military. On 12 January 1848 a rising in Palermo spread throughout the island and served as a spark for the Revolutions of 1848 all over Europe. After similar revolutionary outbursts in Salerno, south of Naples, and in the Cilento region which were backed by the majority of the intelligentsia of the Kingdom, on 29 January 1848 King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies was forced to grant a constitution, using for a pattern the French Charter of 1830. This constitution was quite advanced for its time in liberal democratic terms, as was the proposal of a unified Italian confederation of states. On 11 February 1848, Leopold II of Tuscany, first cousin of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, granted the Constitution, with the general approval of his subjects. The Habsburg example was followed by Charles Albert of Sardinia (Albertine Statute; later became the constitution of the unified Kingdom of Italy and remained in force, with changes, until 1948) and by Pope Pius IX (Fundamental Statute). However, only King Charles Albert maintained the statute even after the end of the riots.

The Kingdom of Italy, after the unification of Italy in 1861, was a constitutional monarchy. The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals. The Italian Socialist Party increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. From 1915 to 1918, the Kingdom of Italy took part in World War I on the side of the Entente and against the Central Powers. In 1922, following a period of crisis and turmoil, the Italian fascist dictatorship was established. During World War II, Italy was first part of the Axis until it surrendered to the Allied powers (1940‚Äì1943) and then, as part of its territory was occupied by Nazi Germany with fascist collaboration, a co-belligerent of the Allies during the Italian resistance and the subsequent Italian Civil War, and the liberation of Italy (1943‚Äì1945). The aftermath of World War II left Italy also with an anger against the monarchy for its endorsement of the Fascist regime for the previous twenty years. These frustrations contributed to a revival of the Italian republican movement. Italy became a republic after the 1946 Italian institutional referendum held on 2 June, a day celebrated since as &quot;Festa della Repubblica&quot;. Italy has a written democratic constitution, resulting from the work of a Constituent Assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the liberation of Italy and the Italian Civil War, and coming into force on 1 January 1948.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, limited democratic reforms were introduced during the Meiji period (when the industrial modernization of Japan began), the Taish≈ç period (1912‚Äì1926), and the early Sh≈çwa period. Despite pro-democracy movements such as the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement (1870s and 1880s) and some proto-democratic institutions, Japanese society remained constrained by a highly conservative society and bureaucracy. Historian Kent E. Calder notes that writers that &quot;Meiji leadership embraced constitutional government with some pluralist features for essentially tactical reasons&quot; and that pre-World war II Japanese society was dominated by a &quot;loose coalition&quot; of &quot;landed rural elites, big business, and the military&quot; that was averse to pluralism and reformism. While the Imperial Diet survived the impacts of Japanese militarism, the Great Depression, and the Pacific War, other pluralistic institutions, such as political parties, did not. After World War II, during the Allied occupation, Japan adopted a much more vigorous, pluralistic democracy.

=== Madagascar===
=== Malawi===
=== Latin America ===
Countries in Latin America became independent between 1810 and 1825, and soon had some early experiences with representative government and elections. All Latin American countries established representative institutions soon after independence, the early cases being those of Colombia in 1810, Paraguay and Venezuela in 1811, and Chile in 1818. Adam Przeworski shows that some experiments with representative institutions in Latin America occurred earlier than in most European countries. Mass democracy, in which the working class had the right to vote, become common only in the 1930s and 1940s.

=== Portugal ===
=== Senegal ===
=== Spain ===
=== South Africa===
=== South Korea ===
=== Soviet Union ===
=== Switzerland ===
=== Roman Republic ===
=== Tunisia ===
=== Ukraine ===
=== United States of America ===
The American Revolution (1765‚Äì1783) created the United States. The new Constitution established a relatively strong federal national government that included an executive, a national judiciary, and a bicameral Congress that represented states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives. In many fields, it was a success ideologically in the sense that a true republic was established that never had a single dictator, but voting rights were initially restricted to white male property owners (about 6% of the population). Slavery was not abolished in the Southern states until the constitutional Amendments of the Reconstruction era following the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). The provision of Civil Rights for African-Americans to overcome post-Reconstruction Jim Crow segregation in the South was achieved in the 1960s.

==Causes and factors==
There is considerable debate about the factors which affect (e.g., promote or limit) democratization. Factors discussed include economic, political, cultural, individual agents and their choices, international and historical.

=== Economic factors ===

==== Economic development and modernization theory ====

Scholars such as Seymour Martin Lipset; Carles Boix and Susan Stokes, and Dietrich Rueschemeyer, Evelyne Stephens, and John Stephens argue that economic development increases the likelihood of democratization. Initially argued by Lipset in 1959, this subsequently been referred to as modernization theory. According to Daniel Treisman, there is &quot;a strong and consistent relationship between higher income and both democratization and democratic survival in the medium term (10‚Äì20 years), but not necessarily in shorter time windows.&quot; Robert Dahl argued that market economies provided favorable conditions for democratic institutions.

A higher GDP/capita correlates with democracy and some claim the wealthiest democracies have never been observed to fall into authoritarianism. The rise of Hitler and of the Nazis in Weimar Germany can be seen as an obvious counter-example, but although in early 1930s Germany was already an advanced economy, by that time, the country was also living in a state of economic crisis virtually since the first World War (in the 1910s), a crisis which was eventually worsened by the effects of the Great Depression. There is also the general observation that democracy was very rare before the industrial revolution. Empirical research thus led many to believe that economic development either increases chances for a transition to democracy, or helps newly established democracies consolidate. One study finds that economic development prompts democratization but only in the medium run (10‚Äì20 years). This is because development may entrench the incumbent leader but make it more difficult for him deliver the state to a son or trusted aide when he exits. However, the debate about whether democracy is a consequence of wealth, a cause of it, or both processes are unrelated, is far from conclusive. Another study suggests that economic development depends on the political stability of a country to promote democracy. Clark, Robert and Golder, in their reformulation of Albert Hirschman&#x27;s model of &quot;Exit, Voice and Loyalty&quot;, explain how it is not the increase of wealth in a country &quot;per se&quot; which influences a democratization process, but rather the changes in the socio-economic structures that come together with the increase of wealth. They explain how these structure changes have been called out to be one of the main reasons several European countries became democratic. When their socioeconomic structures shifted because modernization made the agriculture sector more efficient, bigger investments of time and resources were used for the manufacture and service sectors. In England, for example, members of the gentry began investing more in commercial activities that allowed them to become economically more important for the state. This new kind of productive activities came with new economic power were assets became more difficult for the state to count and hence more difficult to tax. Because of this, predation was no longer possible and the state had to negotiate with the new economic elites to extract revenue. A sustainable bargain had to be reached because the state became more dependent of its citizens remaining loyal and, with this, citizens had now leverage to be taken into account in the decision making process for the country.

Adam Przeworski and Fernando Limongi argue that while economic development makes democracies less likely to turn authoritarian, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that development causes democratization (turning an authoritarian state into a democracy). Economic development can boost public support for authoritarian regimes in the short-to-medium term. Andrew J. Nathan argues that China is a problematic case for the thesis that economic development causes democratization. Michael Miller finds that development increases the likelihood of &quot;democratization in regimes that are fragile and unstable, but makes this fragility less likely to begin with.&quot;

There is research to suggest that greater urbanization, through various pathways, contributes to democratization. 

Numerous scholars and political thinkers have linked a large middle class to the emergence and sustenance of democracy, whereas others have challenged this relationship.

In &quot;Non-Modernization&quot; (2022), Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that modernization theory cannot account for various paths of political development &quot;because it posits a link between economics and politics that is not conditional on institutions and culture and that presumes a definite endpoint‚Äîfor example, an &#x27;end of history&#x27;.&quot;

A meta-analysis by Gerardo L. Munck of research on Lipset&#x27;s argument shows that a majority of studies do not support the thesis that higher levels of economic development leads to more democracy.

A 2024 study linked industrialization to democratization, arguing that large-scale employment in manufacturing made mass mobilization easier to occur and harder to repress.

====Capital Mobility====
Theories on causes to democratization such as economic development focus rather on the aspect of gaining capital, capital mobility focuses on the movement of money and the across borders of countries and different financial instruments and the corresponding restrictions. Over the past decades they have been multiple theories as to what the relationship is between capital mobility and democratization.

The ‚Äúdoomsway view‚Äù is that capital mobility is an inherent threat to underdeveloped democracies by worsening the economic inequalities and favoring the interests of powerful elites and external actors over broader societal, which might lead to depending on money from outside, therefore affected by the economic situation in other countries. Sylvia Maxfield argues that a bigger demand for transparency in both the private and public sectors by some investors can contribute to a strengthening of democratic institutions and can encourage democratic consolidation.

A 2016 study found that preferential trade agreements can increase democratization of a country, especially in case of trade with other democracies. A 2020 study found increased trade between democracies reduces democratic backsliding, while trade between democracies and autocracies reduces democratization of the autocracies. Trade and capital mobility often involve international organizations, such as the International Money Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization (WTO), which can condition financial assistance or trade agreements on democratic reforms.

==== Classes, cleavages and alliances ====

Sociologist Barrington Moore Jr., in his influential Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (1966), argues that the distribution of power among classes ‚Äì the peasantry, the bourgeoise and the landed aristocracy ‚Äì and the nature of alliances between classes determined whether democratic, authoritarian or communist revolutions occurred. Moore also argued there were at least &quot;three routes to the modern world&quot; ‚Äì the liberal democratic, the fascist, and the communist ‚Äì each deriving from the timing of industrialization and the social structure at the time of transition. Thus, Moore challenged modernization theory, by stressing that there was not one path to the modern world and that economic development did not always bring about democracy.

Many authors have questioned parts of Moore&#x27;s arguments. Dietrich Rueschemeyer, Evelyne Stephens, and John D. Stephens, in &quot;Capitalist Development and Democracy&quot; (1992), raise questions about Moore&#x27;s analysis of the role of the bourgeoisie in democratization. Eva Bellin argues that under certain circumstances, the bourgeoise and labor are more likely to favor democratization, but less so under other circumstances. Samuel Valenzuela argues that, counter to Moore&#x27;s view, the landed elite supported democratization in Chile. A comprehensive assessment conducted by James Mahoney concludes that &quot;Moore&#x27;s specific hypotheses about democracy and authoritarianism receive only limited and highly conditional support.&quot;

A 2020 study linked democratization to the mechanization of agriculture: as landed elites became less reliant on the repression of agricultural workers, they became less hostile to democracy.

According to political scientist David Stasavage, representative government is &quot;more likely to occur when a society is divided across multiple political cleavages.&quot; A 2021 study found that constitutions that emerge through pluralism (reflecting distinct segments of society) are more likely to induce liberal democracy (at least, in the short term).

=== Political-economic factors ===
==== Rulers&#x27; need for taxation ====
Robert Bates and Donald Lien, as well as David Stasavage, have argued that rulers&#x27; need for taxes gave asset-owning elites the bargaining power to demand a say on public policy, thus giving rise to democratic institutions. Montesquieu argued that the mobility of commerce meant that rulers had to bargain with merchants in order to tax them, otherwise they would leave the country or hide their commercial activities. Stasavage argues that the small size and backwardness of European states, as well as the weakness of European rulers, after the fall of the Roman Empire meant that European rulers had to obtain consent from their population to govern effectively.

According to Clark, Golder, and Golder, an application of Albert O. Hirschman&#x27;s exit, voice, and loyalty model is that if individuals have plausible exit options, then a government may be more likely to democratize. James C. Scott argues that governments may find it difficult to claim a sovereignty over a population when that population is in motion. Scott additionally asserts that exit may not solely include physical exit from the territory of a coercive state, but can include a number of adaptive responses to coercion that make it more difficult for states to claim sovereignty over a population. These responses can include planting crops that are more difficult for states to count, or tending livestock that are more mobile. In fact, the entire political arrangement of a state is a result of individuals adapting to the environment, and making a choice as to whether or not to stay in a territory. If people are free to move, then the exit, voice, and loyalty model predicts that a state will have to be of that population representative, and appease the populace in order to prevent them from leaving. If individuals have plausible exit options then they are better able to constrain a government&#x27;s arbitrary behaviour through threat of exit.

==== Inequality and democracy ====
Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argued that the relationship between social equality and democratic transition is complicated: People have less incentive to revolt in an egalitarian society (for example, Singapore), so the likelihood of democratization is lower. In a highly unequal society (for example, South Africa under Apartheid), the redistribution of wealth and power in a democracy would be so harmful to elites that these would do everything to prevent democratization. Democratization is more likely to emerge somewhere in the middle, in the countries, whose elites offer concessions because (1) they consider the threat of a revolution credible and (2) the cost of the concessions is not too high. This expectation is in line with the empirical research showing that democracy is more stable in egalitarian societies.

Other approaches to the relationship between inequality and democracy have been presented by Carles Boix, Stephan Haggard and Robert Kaufman, and Ben Ansell and David Samuels.

In their 2019 book &quot;The Narrow Corridor&quot; and a 2022 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot;, Acemoglu and Robinson argue that the nature of the relationship between elites and society determine whether stable democracy emerges. When elites are overly dominant, despotic states emerge. When society is overly dominant, weak states emerge. When elites and society are evenly balance, inclusive states emerge.

==== Natural resources ====

Research shows that oil wealth lowers levels of democracy and strengthens autocratic rule. According to Michael Ross, petroleum is the sole resource that has &quot;been consistently correlated with less democracy and worse institutions&quot; and is the &quot;key variable in the vast majority of the studies&quot; identifying some type of resource curse effect. A 2014 meta-analysis confirms the negative impact of oil wealth on democratization.

Thad Dunning proposes a plausible explanation for Ecuador&#x27;s return to democracy that contradicts the conventional wisdom that natural resource rents encourage authoritarian governments. Dunning proposes that there are situations where natural resource rents, such as those acquired through oil, reduce the risk of distributive or social policies to the elite because the state has other sources of revenue to finance this kind of policies that is not the elite wealth or income. And in countries plagued with high inequality, which was the case of Ecuador in the 1970s, the result would be a higher likelihood of democratization. In 1972, the military coup had overthrown the government in large part because of the fears of elites that redistribution would take place. That same year oil became an increasing financial source for the country. Although the rents were used to finance the military, the eventual second oil boom of 1979 ran parallel to the country&#x27;s re-democratization. Ecuador&#x27;s re-democratization can then be attributed, as argued by Dunning, to the large increase of oil rents, which enabled not only a surge in public spending but placated the fears of redistribution that had grappled the elite circles. The exploitation of Ecuador&#x27;s resource rent enabled the government to implement price and wage policies that benefited citizens at no cost to the elite and allowed for a smooth transition and growth of democratic institutions.

The thesis that oil and other natural resources have a negative impact on democracy has been challenged by historian Stephen Haber and political scientist Victor Menaldo in a widely cited article in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; (2011). Haber and Menaldo argue that &quot;natural resource reliance is not an exogenous variable&quot; and find that when tests of the relationship between natural resources and democracy take this point into account &quot;increases in resource reliance are not associated with authoritarianism.&quot;

=== Cultural factors ===
==== Values and religion ====
It is claimed by some that certain cultures are simply more conducive to democratic values than others. This view is likely to be ethnocentric. Typically, it is Western culture which is cited as &quot;best suited&quot; to democracy, with other cultures portrayed as containing values which make democracy difficult or undesirable. This argument is sometimes used by undemocratic regimes to justify their failure to implement democratic reforms. Today, however, there are many non-Western democracies. Examples include: India, Japan, Indonesia, Namibia, Botswana, Taiwan, and South Korea. Research finds that &quot;Western-educated leaders significantly and substantively improve a country&#x27;s democratization prospects&quot;.

Huntington presented an influential, but also controversial arguments about Confucianism and Islam. Huntington held that &quot;In practice Confucian or Confucian-influenced societies have been inhospitable to democracy.&quot; He also held that &quot;Islamic doctrine ... contains elements that may be both congenial and uncongenial to democracy,&quot; but generally thought that Islam was an obstacle to democratization. In contrast, Alfred Stepan was more optimistic about the compatibility of different religions and democracy.
Steven Fish and Robert Barro have linked Islam to undemocratic outcomes. However, Michael Ross argues that the lack of democracies in some parts of the Muslim world has more to do with the adverse effects of the resource curse than Islam. Lisa Blaydes and Eric Chaney have linked the democratic divergence between the West and the Middle-East to the reliance on mamluks (slave soldiers) by Muslim rulers whereas European rulers had to rely on local elites for military forces, thus giving those elites bargaining power to push for representative government.

Robert Dahl argued, in &quot;On Democracy&quot;, that countries with a &quot;democratic political culture&quot; were more prone for democratization and democratic survival. He also argued that cultural homogeneity and smallness contribute to democratic survival. Other scholars have however challenged the notion that small states and homogeneity strengthen democracy.

A 2012 study found that areas in Africa with Protestant missionaries were more likely to become stable democracies. A 2020 study failed to replicate those findings.

Sirianne Dahlum and Carl Henrik Knutsen offer a test of the Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel revised version of modernization theory, which focuses on cultural traits triggered by economic development that are presumed to be conducive to democratization. They find &quot;no empirical support&quot; for the Inglehart and Welzel thesis and conclude that &quot;self-expression values do not enhance democracy levels or democratization chances, and neither do they stabilize existing democracies.&quot;

==== Education ====
It has long been theorized that education promotes stable and democratic societies. Research shows that education leads to greater political tolerance, increases the likelihood of political participation and reduces inequality. One study finds &quot;that increases in levels of education improve levels of democracy and that the democratizing effect of education is more intense in poor countries&quot;.

It is commonly claimed that democracy and democratization were important drivers of the expansion of primary education around the world. However, new evidence from historical education trends challenges this assertion. An analysis of historical student enrollment rates for 109 countries from 1820 to 2010 finds no support for the claim that democratization increased access to primary education around the world. It is true that transitions to democracy often coincided with an acceleration in the expansion of primary education, but the same acceleration was observed in countries that remained non-democratic.

Wider adoption of voting advice applications can lead to increased education on politics and increased voter turnout.

==== Social capital and civil society ====

Civil society refers to a collection of non-governmental organizations and institutions that advance the interests, priorities and will of citizens. Social capital refers to features of social life‚Äînetworks, norms, and trust‚Äîthat allow individuals to act together to pursue shared objectives.

Robert Putnam argues that certain characteristics make societies more likely to have cultures of civic engagement that lead to more participatory democracies. According to Putnam, communities with denser horizontal networks of civic association are able to better build the &quot;norms of trust, reciprocity, and civic engagement&quot; that lead to democratization and well-functioning participatory democracies. By contrasting communities in Northern Italy, which had dense horizontal networks, to communities in Southern Italy, which had more vertical networks and patron-client relations, Putnam asserts that the latter never built the culture of civic engagement that some deem as necessary for successful democratization.

Sheri Berman has rebutted Putnam&#x27;s theory that civil society contributes to democratization, writing that in the case of the Weimar Republic, civil society facilitated the rise of the Nazi Party. According to Berman, Germany&#x27;s democratization after World War I allowed for a renewed development in the country&#x27;s civil society; however, Berman argues that this vibrant civil society eventually weakened democracy within Germany as it exacerbated existing social divisions due to the creation of exclusionary community organizations. Subsequent empirical research and theoretical analysis has lent support for Berman&#x27;s argument. Yale University political scientist Daniel Mattingly argues civil society in China helps the authoritarian regime in China to cement control. Clark, M. Golder, and S. Golder also argue that despite many believing democratization requires a civic culture, empirical evidence produced by several reanalyses of past studies suggest this claim is only partially supported. Philippe C. Schmitter also asserts that the existence of civil society is not a prerequisite for the transition to democracy, but rather democratization is usually followed by the resurrection of civil society (even if it did not exist previously).

Research indicates that democracy protests are associated with democratization. According to a study by Freedom House, in 67 countries where dictatorships have fallen since 1972, nonviolent civic resistance was a strong influence over 70 percent of the time. In these transitions, changes were catalyzed not through foreign invasion, and only rarely through armed revolt or voluntary elite-driven reforms, but overwhelmingly by democratic civil society organizations utilizing nonviolent action and other forms of civil resistance, such as strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, and mass protests. A 2016 study found that about a quarter of all cases of democracy protests between 1989 and 2011 lead to democratization.

=== Theories based on political agents and choices ===
==== Elite-opposition negotiations and contingency ====
Scholars such as Dankwart A. Rustow, and Guillermo O&#x27;Donnell and Philippe C. Schmitter in their classic &quot;Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Tentative Conclusions about Uncertain Democracies&quot; (1986), argued against the notion that there are structural &quot;big&quot; causes of democratization. These scholars instead emphasize how the democratization process occurs in a more contingent manner that depends on the characteristics and circumstances of the elites who ultimately oversee the shift from authoritarianism to democracy.

O&#x27;Donnell and Schmitter proposed a strategic choice approach to transitions to democracy that highlighted how they were driven by the decisions of different actors in response to a core set of dilemmas. The analysis centered on the interaction among four actors: the hard-liners and soft-liners who belonged to the incumbent authoritarian regime, and the moderate and radical oppositions against the regime. This book not only became the point of reference for a burgeoning academic literature on democratic transitions, it was also read widely by political activists engaged in actual struggles to achieve democracy.

Adam Przeworski, in &quot;Democracy and the Market&quot; (1991), offered the first analysis of the interaction between rulers and opposition in transitions to democracy using rudimentary game theory. and he emphasizes the interdependence of political and economic transformations.

==== Elite-driven democratization ====
Scholars have argued that processes of democratization may be elite-driven or driven by the authoritarian incumbents as a way for those elites to retain power amid popular demands for representative government. If the costs of repression are higher than the costs of giving away power, authoritarians may opt for democratization and inclusive institutions. According to a 2020 study, authoritarian-led democratization is more likely to lead to lasting democracy in cases when the party strength of the authoritarian incumbent is high. However, Michael Albertus and Victor Menaldo argue that democratizing rules implemented by outgoing authoritarians may distort democracy in favor of the outgoing authoritarian regime and its supporters, resulting in &quot;bad&quot; institutions that are hard to get rid of. According to Michael K. Miller, elite-driven democratization is particularly likely in the wake of major violent shocks (either domestic or international) which provide openings to opposition actors to the authoritarian regime. Dan Slater and Joseph Wong argue that dictators in Asia chose to implement democratic reforms when they were in positions of strength in order to retain and revitalize their power.

According to a study by political scientist Daniel Treisman, influential theories of democratization posit that autocrats &quot;deliberately choose to share or surrender power. They do so to prevent revolution, motivate citizens to fight wars, incentivize governments to provide public goods, outbid elite rivals, or limit factional violence.&quot; His study shows that in many cases, &quot;democratization occurred not because incumbent elites chose it but because, in trying to prevent it, they made mistakes that weakened their hold on power. Common mistakes include: calling elections or starting military conflicts, only to lose them; ignoring popular unrest and being overthrown; initiating limited reforms that get out of hand; and selecting a covert democrat as leader. These mistakes reflect well-known cognitive biases such as overconfidence and the illusion of control.&quot;

Sharun Mukand and Dani Rodrik dispute that elite-driven democratization produce liberal democracy. They argue that low levels of inequality and weak identity cleavages are necessary for liberal democracy to emerge. A 2020 study by several political scientists from German universities found that democratization through bottom-up peaceful protests led to higher levels of democracy and democratic stability than democratization prompted by elites.

The three dictatorship types, monarchy, civilian and military have different approaches to democratization as a result of their individual goals. Monarchic and civilian dictatorships seek to remain in power indefinitely through hereditary rule in the case of monarchs or through oppression in the case of civilian dictators. A military dictatorship seizes power to act as a caretaker government to replace what they consider a flawed civilian government. Military dictatorships are more likely to transition to democracy because at the onset, they are meant to be stop-gap solutions while a new acceptable government forms.

Research suggests that the threat of civil conflict encourages regimes to make democratic concessions. A 2016 study found that drought-induced riots in Sub-Saharan Africa lead regimes, fearing conflict, to make democratic concessions.

==== Scrambled constituencies ====
Mancur Olson theorizes that the process of democratization occurs when elites are unable to reconstitute an autocracy. Olson suggests that this occurs when constituencies or identity groups are mixed within a geographic region. He asserts that this mixed geographic constituencies requires elites to for democratic and representative institutions to control the region, and to limit the power of competing elite groups.

==== Death or ouster of dictator ====
One analysis found that &quot;Compared with other forms of leadership turnover in autocracies‚Äîsuch as coups, elections, or term limits‚Äîwhich lead to regime collapse about half of the time, the death of a dictator is remarkably inconsequential. ... of the 79 dictators who have died in office (1946‚Äì2014)... in the vast majority (92%) of cases, the regime persists after the autocrat&#x27;s death.&quot;

=== Women&#x27;s suffrage ===
One of the critiques of Huntington&#x27;s periodization is that it doesn&#x27;t give enough weight to universal suffrage. Pamela Paxton argues that once women&#x27;s suffrage is taken into account, the data reveal &quot;a long, continuous democratization period from 1893‚Äì1958, with only war-related reversals.&quot;

=== International factors ===
==== War and national security ====
Jeffrey Herbst, in his paper &quot;War and the State in Africa&quot; (1990), explains how democratization in European states was achieved through political development fostered by war-making and these &quot;lessons from the case of Europe show that war is an important cause of state formation that is missing in Africa today.&quot; Herbst writes that war and the threat of invasion by neighbors caused European state to more efficiently collect revenue, forced leaders to improve administrative capabilities, and fostered state unification and a sense of national identity (a common, powerful association between the state and its citizens). Herbst writes that in Africa and elsewhere in the non-European world &quot;states are developing in a fundamentally new environment&quot; because they mostly &quot;gained Independence without having to resort to combat and have not faced a security threat since independence.&quot; Herbst notes that the strongest non-European states, South Korea and Taiwan, are &quot;largely &#x27;warfare&#x27; states that have been molded, in part, by the near constant threat of external aggression.&quot;

Elizabeth Kier has challenged claims that total war prompts democratization, showing in the cases of the UK and Italy during World War I that the policies adopted by the Italian government during World War I prompted a fascist backlash whereas UK government policies towards labor undermined broader democratization.

==== War and peace ====
Wars may contribute to the state-building that precedes a transition to democracy, but war is mainly a serious obstacle to democratization. While adherents of the democratic peace theory believe that democracy causes peace, the territorial peace theory makes the opposite claim that peace causes democracy. In fact, war and territorial threats to a country are likely to increase authoritarianism and lead to autocracy. 
This is supported by historical evidence showing that in almost all cases, peace has come before democracy. A number of scholars have argued that there is little support for the hypothesis that democracy causes peace, but strong evidence for the opposite hypothesis that peace leads to democracy.

Christian Welzel&#x27;s human empowerment theory posits that existential security leads to emancipative cultural values and support for a democratic political organization. This is in agreement with theories based on evolutionary psychology. The so-called regality theory finds that people develop a psychological preference for a strong leader and an authoritarian form of government in situations of war or perceived collective danger. On the other hand, people will support egalitarian values and a preference for democracy in situations of peace and safety. The consequence of this is that a society will develop in the direction of autocracy and an authoritarian government when people perceive collective danger, while the development in the democratic direction requires collective safety.

==== International institutions ====
A number of studies have found that institutional institutions have helped facilitate democratization. Thomas Risse wrote in 2009, &quot;there is a consensus in the literature on Eastern Europe that the EU membership perspective had a huge anchoring effects for the new democracies.&quot; Scholars have also linked NATO expansion with playing a role in democratization. international forces can significantly affect democratization. Global forces like the diffusion of democratic ideas and pressure from international financial institutions to democratize have led to democratization.

==== Promotion, and foreign influence and intervention ====

The European Union has contributed to the spread of democracy, in particular by encouraging democratic reforms in aspiring member states. Thomas Risse wrote in 2009, &quot;there is a consensus in the literature on Eastern Europe that the EU membership perspective had a huge anchoring effects for the new democracies.&quot;

Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way have argued that close ties to the West increased the likelihood of democratization after the end of the Cold War, whereas states with weak ties to the West adopted competitive authoritarian regimes.

A 2002 study found that membership in regional organizations &quot;is correlated with transitions to democracy during the period from 1950 to 1992.&quot;

A 2004 study found no evidence that foreign aid led to democratization.

Democracies have often been imposed by military intervention, for example in Japan and Germany after World War II. In other cases, decolonization sometimes facilitated the establishment of democracies that were soon replaced by authoritarian regimes. For example, Syria, after gaining independence from French mandatory control at the beginning of the Cold War, failed to consolidate its democracy, so it eventually collapsed and was replaced by a Ba&#x27;athist dictatorship.

Robert Dahl argued in &quot;On Democracy&quot; that foreign interventions contributed to democratic failures, citing Soviet interventions in Central and Eastern Europe and U.S. interventions in Latin America. However, the delegitimization of empires contributed to the emergence of democracy as former colonies gained independence and implemented democracy.

==== Geographic factors ====
Some scholars link the emergence and sustenance of democracies to areas with access to the sea, which tends to increase the mobility of people, goods, capital, and ideas.

=== Historical factors ===
==== Historical legacies ====
In seeking to explain why North America developed stable democracies and Latin America did not, Seymour Martin Lipset, in &quot;The Democratic Century&quot; (2004), holds that the reason is that the initial patterns of colonization, the subsequent process of economic incorporation of the new colonies, and the wars of independence differ. The divergent histories of Britain and Iberia are seen as creating different cultural legacies that affected the prospects of democracy. A related argument is presented by James A. Robinson in &quot;Critical Junctures and Developmental Paths&quot; (2022).

=== Sequencing and causality ===
Scholars have discussed whether the order in which things happen helps or hinders the process of democratization. An early discussion occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. Dankwart Rustow argued that &quot;&#x27;the most effective sequence&#x27; is the pursuit of national unity, government authority, and political equality, in that order.&quot; Eric Nordlinger and Samuel Huntington stressed &quot;the importance of developing effective governmental institutions before the emergence of mass participation in politics.&quot; Robert Dahl, in &quot;Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition&quot; (1971), held that the &quot;commonest sequence among the older and more stable polyarchies has been some approximation of the ... path [in which] competitive politics preceded expansion in participation.&quot;

In the 2010s, the discussion focused on the impact of the sequencing between state building and democratization. Francis Fukuyama, in Political Order and Political Decay (2014), echoes Huntington&#x27;s &quot;state-first&quot; argument and holds that those &quot;countries in which democracy preceded modern state-building have had much greater problems achieving high-quality governance.&quot; This view has been supported by Sheri Berman, who offers a sweeping overview of European history and concludes that &quot;sequencing matters&quot; and that &quot;without strong states...liberal democracy is difficult if not impossible to achieve.&quot;
However, this state-first thesis has been challenged. Relying on a comparison of Denmark and Greece, and quantitative research on 180 countries across 1789‚Äì2019, Haakon Gjerl√∏w, Carl Henrik Knutsen, Tore Wig, and Matthew C. Wilson, in &quot;One Road to Riches?&quot; (2022), &quot;find little evidence to support the stateness-first argument.&quot; Based on a comparison of European and Latin American countries, Sebasti√°n Mazzuca and Gerardo Munck, in &quot;A Middle-Quality Institutional Trap&quot; (2021), argue that counter to the state-first thesis, the &quot;starting point of political developments is less important than whether the State‚Äìdemocracy relationship is a virtuous cycle, triggering causal mechanisms that reinforce each.&quot;

In sequences of democratization for many countries, Morrison et al. found elections as the most frequent first element of the sequence of democratization but found this ordering does not necessarily predict successful democratization.

The democratic peace theory claims that democracy causes peace, while the territorial peace theory claims that peace causes democracy.

<text>The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, also known as the Hart‚ÄìCeller Act and more recently as the 1965 Immigration Act, was a federal law passed by the 89th United States Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The law abolished the National Origins Formula, which had been the basis of U.S. immigration policy since the 1920s. The act formally removed &quot;de facto&quot; discrimination against Southern and Eastern Europeans as well as Asians, in addition to other non-Western and Northern European ethnicities from the immigration policy of the United States.

The National Origins Formula had been established in the 1920s to preserve American homogeneity by promoting immigration from Western and Northern Europe. During the 1960s, at the height of the civil rights movement, this approach increasingly came under attack for being racially discriminatory. The bill is based on the draft bill sent to the Congress by President John F. Kennedy, who opposed the immigration formulas, in 1963, and was introduced by Senator Philip Hart and Congressman Emanuel Celler. However, its passage was stalled due to opposition from conservative Congressmen.

With the support of the Johnson administration, Celler and Hart introduced the bill again in 1965 to repeal the formula. The bill received wide support from both northern Democratic and Republican members of Congress, but strong opposition mostly from Southern conservatives, the latter mostly voting Nay or Not Voting. President Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 into law on October 3, 1965. Prior to the Act, the U.S. was 85% White, with Black people (most of whom were descendants of slaves) making up 11%, while Latinos made up less than 4%. In opening entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than Western and Northern Europeans, the Act significantly altered the demographic mix in the country.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 created a seven-category preference system that gives priority to relatives and children of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, professionals and other individuals with specialized skills, and refugees. The act also set a numerical limit on immigration (120,000 per annum) from the Western Hemisphere for the first time in U.S. history. Within the following decades, the United States would see an increased number of immigrants from Asia and Africa, as well as Eastern and Southern Europe.

==Background==
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 marked a radical break from U.S. immigration policies of the past. Since Congress restricted naturalized citizenship to &quot;white persons&quot; in 1790, laws restricted immigration from Asia and Africa, and gave preference to Northern and Western Europeans over Southern and Eastern Europeans. During this time, most of those immigrating to the U.S. were Northern Europeans of Protestant faith and Western Africans who were human trafficked because of American chattel slavery. This pattern shifted in the mid to late 19th century for both the Western and Eastern regions of the United States. There was a large influx of immigration from Asia in the Western region‚Äîespecially from China whose workers provided cheap labor‚Äîwhile Eastern and Southern European immigrants settled more in the Eastern United States.

Once the demographics of immigration were changing, there were policies put in place to reduce immigration to exclude individuals of certain ethnicities and races. Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to stop the inflow of Chinese immigrants. Then in 1917, Congress passed the Immigration Act; this act had prevented most immigration of non-North Western Europeans because it tested language understanding. This act was followed by the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921, that placed a quota on immigration which used the rate of immigration in 1910 to mirror the immigration rate of all countries. The Emergency Immigration Act of 1921 had helped bring along the Immigration Act of 1924 had permanently established the National Origins Formula as the basis of U.S. immigration policy, largely to restrict immigration from Asia, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe. According to the Office of the Historian of the U.S. Department of State, the purpose of the 1924 Act was &quot;to preserve the ideal of U.S. homogeneity&quot; by limiting immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. The &quot;National Socialist Handbook for Law and Legislation&quot; of 1934‚Äì35, edited by the lawyer Hans Frank, contains a pivotal essay by Herbert Kier on the recommendations for race legislation which devoted a quarter of its pages to U.S. legislation, including race-based citizenship laws, anti-miscegenation laws, and immigration laws. Adolf Hitler wrote of his admiration of America&#x27;s immigration laws in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, saying:
In the 1960s, the United States faced both foreign and domestic pressures to change its nation-based formula, which was regarded as a system that discriminated based on an individual&#x27;s place of birth. Abroad, former military allies and new independent nations aimed to de-legitimize discriminatory immigration, naturalization and regulations through international organizations like the United Nations. In the United States, the national-based formula had been under scrutiny for a number of years. In 1952, President Truman had directed the Commission on Immigration and Naturalization to conduct an investigation and produce a report on the current immigration regulations. The report, &quot;Whom We Shall Welcome&quot;, served as the blueprint for the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. At the height of the Civil Rights Movement the restrictive immigration laws were seen as an embarrassment. At the time of the act&#x27;s passing, many high-ranking politicians favored this bill to be passed, including President Lyndon B. Johnson. However, only about half the public reciprocated these feelings, which can be seen in a Gallup Organization poll in 1965 asking whether they were in favor of getting rid of the national quota act, and 51 percent were in favor. The act was pressured by high-ranking officials and interest groups to be passed, which it was passed on October 3, 1965. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1965 act into law at the foot of the Statue of Liberty, ending preferences for white immigrants dating to the 18th century.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 did not make it fully illegal for the United States government to discriminate against individuals, which included members of the LGBTQ+ community to be prohibited under the legislation. The Immigration and Naturalization Service continued to deny entry to prospective immigrants who are in the LGBTQ+ community on the grounds that they were &quot;mentally defective&quot;, or had a &quot;constitutional psychopathic inferiority&quot; until the Immigration Act of 1990 rescinded the provision discriminating against members of the LGBT+ community.

== Legislative history ==
In 1958, Senator John F. Kennedy or his team penned a pamphlet titled &quot;A Nation of Immigrants&quot;, opposing the immigration quotas set forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, after being convinced to do so by the Anti-Defamation League. The content of the pamphlet was based on the ideas of the historian Oscar Handlin and an outline by his student Arthur Mann, with Kennedy&#x27;s version de-emphasizing the difficulties in assimilation of immigrants elucidated by Handlin and Mann, and promoting a more idealistic view. Immigration reform was promoted by Kennedy during his 1960 presidential campaign, with support from his brothers Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy.

Following Kennedy&#x27;s civil rights address in June 1963, he had Robert, who was the United States Attorney General, prepare a draft bill, which was authored by Adam Walinsky, and sent it to the Congress on July 23, 1963. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Emanuel Celler, who had advocated for such an immigration reform since 1920s, and by Philip Hart in the Senate. Ted was assigned to ensure the passage of the bill through the Congress.

The act had a long history of trying to get passed by Congress. It had been introduced a number of times to the Senate between March 14, 1960, when it was first introduced, to August 19, 1965, which was the last time it was presented. It was hard to pass this law under Kennedy&#x27;s administration because Senator James Eastland (D-MS), Representative Michael Feighan (D-OH), and Representative Francis Walter (D-PA), who were in control of the immigration subcommittees, were against immigration reform. When President Lyndon B. Johnson became president on January 8, 1964, he pressured Congress to act upon reform in immigration. However, this president&#x27;s support did not stop the debate of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 until January 4, 1965, when President Johnson focused his inaugural address on the reform of immigration, which created intense pressure for the heads of the congressional immigration subcommittees.

=== Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 in the 89th Congress ===
With the support of President Johnson&#x27;s Administration, Representative Emanuel Celler (D-NY) introduced the Immigration and Nationality bill, H.R. 2580. Emanuel Celler was a senior representative, as well as the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee. When Celler introduced the bill, he knew that it would be hard for this bill to move from the committee to the floor successfully; the bill&#x27;s committee was the Immigration and Nationality subcommittee. The chair of the subcommittee was Representative Feighan, who was against immigration reform. In the end, a compromise was made where immigration based on familial reunification is more critical than immigration based on labor and skilled workers. Later, Senator Philip Hart (D-MI) introduced the Immigration and Nationality bill, S.500, to the Senate.

=== Congressional hearings ===
During the subcommittee&#x27;s hearing on Immigration and Naturalization of the Committee in the Judiciary United States Senate, many came forward to voice their support or opposition to the bill. Many higher-ranking officials in the executive and legislative branches, like Dean Rusk (Secretary of State) and Abba P. Schwartz (Administrator, Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State), came forward with active support. Also, many cultural and civil rights organizations, like the Order Sons of Italy in America, and the Grand Council of Columbia Association in Civil Service, supported the act. Many of the bill&#x27;s supporters believed that this future would outlaw racism and prejudice rhetoric that previous immigration quotas have caused; this prejudice has also caused other nations to feel like the United States did not respect them due to their low rating in the previous immigration quotas. Many also believed that this act would highly benefit the United States‚Äô economy because the act focused on allowing skilled workers to enter the United States.

On the other hand, many lobbyists and organizations, such as the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Baltimore Anti-Communistic League, came to the hearing to explain their opposition. Many of the opposition believed that this bill would be against American welfare. The common argument that they used was that if the government allowed more immigrants into the United States, more employment opportunities would be taken away from the American workforce. While the farmers&#x27; organizations, like the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Council of Agricultural, argued that this legislation would be hazardous for the agricultural industry due to the section regarding a limit of immigration of the Western Hemisphere. Before this act, there was no limitation with the immigration of the Western Hemisphere, which allowed many migrant workers in the agricultural industry to easily move from countries in the Western Hemisphere to farms in the United States during critical farming seasons. These agricultural organizations believed that this act could cause issues for migrant workers to enter the United States.

=== The voting of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 ===
Once the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was passed in the subcommittees and brought to floors of Congress, it was widely supported. Senator Philip Hart introduced the administration-backed immigration bill, which was reported to the Senate Judiciary Committee&#x27;s Immigration and Naturalization Subcommittee. Representative Emanuel Celler introduced the bill in the United States House of Representatives, which voted 320 to 70 in favor of the act, while the United States Senate passed the bill by a vote of 76 to 18. In the Senate, 52 Democrats voted yes, 14 no, and 1 abstained. Among Senate Republicans, 24 voted yes, 3 voted no, and 1 abstained. In the House, 202 Democrats voted yes, 60 voted no, and 12 abstained, 118 Republicans voted yes, 10 voted no, and 11 abstained. In total, 74% of Democrats and 85% of Republicans voted for passage of this bill. Most of the no votes were from the American South, which was then still strongly Democratic. During debate on the Senate floor, Senator Ted Kennedy, speaking of the effects of the Act, said, &quot;our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. ... Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset.&quot;

Sen. Hiram Fong (R-HI) answered questions concerning the possible change in the United States&#x27; cultural pattern by an influx of Asians:

Democratic Rep. Michael A. Feighan (OH-20), along with some other Democrats, insisted that &quot;family unification&quot; should take priority over &quot;employability&quot;, on the premise that such a weighting would maintain the existing ethnic profile of the country. That change in policy instead resulted in chain migration dominating the subsequent patterns of immigration to the United States. In removing racial and national discrimination the Act would significantly alter the demographic mix in the U.S.

When the act was on the floor, two possible amendments were created in order to impact the Western Hemisphere aspect of the legislation. In the House, the MacGregor Amendment was debated; this amendment called for the Western Hemisphere limit to be 115,000 immigrants annually. This amendment was rejected in a 189‚Äì218 record vote. Then the act was pushed to the Senate, where a similar amendment was proposed (possibly creating a cap of 115,000 immigrants annually from the Western Hemisphere), but this was also never passed.

=== Enactment ===
On October 3, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson officially signed the Immigration and Nationality Act. Because his administration believed that this was historic legislation, he signed the act at Liberty Island, New York. Upon signing the bill into law, Johnson said, &quot;this [old] system violates the basic principle of American democracy, the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit as a man. It has been un-American in the highest sense, because it has been untrue to the faith that brought thousands to these shores even before we were a country.&quot;

== Provisions ==
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (known as the McCarran‚ÄìWalter Act). It upheld some provisions of the Immigration Act of 1924, while at the same time creating new and more inclusive immigration regulations. It maintained per-country limits, which had been a feature of U.S. immigration policy since the 1920s, and it developed preference categories.

One of the main components of the act was aimed to abolish the national-origins quota. This meant that it eliminated national origin, race, and ancestry as a basis for immigration, making discriminating against obtaining visas illegal.

It created a seven-category preference system. In this system, it explains how visas should be given out in order of most importance. This system prioritized individuals who were relatives of U.S. citizens, legal permanent resident, professionals, and/or other individuals with specialized skills.

* The seven-category preference system is divided by family preferences and skill-based preferences. The family preferences include unmarried children of United States citizens, unmarried children and spouses of permanent residents, married children and their dependents of United States citizens, and siblings and their dependents of United States citizens. At the same time, the skilled preferences include individuals and their dependents who have extraordinary ability or significant knowledge in the arts, sciences, business, or entertainment; skilled workers in sectors facing labor shortages; investors willing to make large-sum investments in the U.S. economy; religious workers; and foreign nationals who have served in the U.S. military. Lastly, skilled-based preferences include the preferences for refugees.

Immediate relatives and &quot;special immigrants&quot; were not subject to numerical restrictions. The law defined &quot;immediate relatives&quot; as children and spouses of United States citizens as well as parents of United States citizens who are 21 years of age or older. It also defined &quot;special immigrants&quot; in six different categories, which includes:

*An immigrant who traveled abroad for a short period of time (i.e., a &quot;Returning Resident&quot;);
*An immigrant and dependents of the immigrant who is conducting religious practices and are needed by a religion sector to be in the United States.
*An immigrant and their dependent who is/was a United States government employee abroad. They must have served 15 or more years to be considered a special immigrant. This category is only given if the Foreign Service Office recommended this specific immigrant to be qualified for this categorization.
*An immigrant who is 14 years old or younger and who has been considered an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen but whose parent(s) cannot take care of them for multiple reasons, including death, abandonment, and so on.

It added a quota system for immigration from the Western Hemisphere, which was not included in the earlier national quota system. This was for the first time, immigration from the Western Hemisphere was limited, while the Eastern Hemisphere saw an increase in the number of visas granted. Previously, immigrants from Western Hemisphere countries needed merely to register themselves as permanent residents with a financial sponsor in the United States to avoid becoming public charges, and were not subject to skills-based requirements.

It added a labor certification requirement, which dictated that the Secretary of Labor needed to certify labor shortages in economic sectors for certain skills-based immigration statuses.

Refugees were given the seventh and last category preference with the possibility of adjusting their status to permanent residents within one year of being granted refugee status. However, refugees could enter the United States by other means, such as seeking temporary asylum.

The provisions of the 1794 Jay Treaty with the United Kingdom still apply, giving freedom of movement to Native Americans born in Canada.

===Immediate impact on quota immigrant admissions===
 
The Act of October 3, 1965, phased out the National Origins Formula quota system set by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in two stages: 
*Effective December 1, 1965, during a transition period covering fiscal years ending June 30 of 1966‚Äì1968, national quotas continued, but any unused quota spots were pooled and made available to other countries that had exhausted their quota, on a first-come, first-served basis. While still granting first priority to European countries according to the National Origins Formula, immigration from countries with high quotas had slowed to far below maximum allotments. In 1965, 296,697 immigrants were admitted out of a total quota of 158,561.
*Effective July 1, 1968, the national quota system was fully abolished, and the broad hemispheric numerical limitations took effect. All nation-level quotas were dropped and replaced by a limit of 170,000 immigrants from the Eastern Hemisphere on a first-come, first-served basis, but while setting a cap of no more than 20,000 from any one country. For the first time, immigration from within the Western Hemisphere was also restricted, legally capped at 120,000 annually.
Listed below are quota immigrants admitted from the Eastern Hemisphere, by country, in given fiscal years ended June 30, for the final National Origins Formula quota year of 1965, the pool transition period 1966‚Äì1968, and for 1969‚Äì1970, the first two fiscal years in which national quotas were fully abolished. 

==Wages under Foreign Certification==
As per the rules under the Immigration and Nationality Act, U.S. organizations are permitted to employ foreign workers either temporarily or permanently to fulfill certain types of job requirements. The Employment and Training Administration under the U.S. Department of Labor is the body that usually provides certification to employers allowing them to hire foreign workers in order to bridge qualified and skilled labor gaps in certain business areas. Employers must confirm that they are unable to hire American workers willing to perform the job for wages paid by employers for the same occupation in the intended area of employment. However, some unique rules are applied to each category of visas. They are as follows:

*H-1B and H-1B1 Specialty (Professional) Workers should have a pay, as per the prevailing wage ‚Äì an average wage that is paid to a person employed in the same occupation in the area of employment; or that the employer pays its workers the actual wage paid to people having similar skills and qualifications.
*H-2A Agricultural Workers should have the highest pay in accordance to the (a) Adverse Effect Wage Rate, (b) the present rate for a particular crop or area, or (c) the state or federal minimum wage. The law also stipulates requirements like employer-sponsored meals and transportation of the employees as well as restrictions on deducting from the workers&#x27; wages.
*H-2B Non-agricultural Workers should receive a payment in accordance with the prevailing wage (mean wage paid to a worker employed in a similar occupation in the concerned area of employment).
*D-1 Crewmembers (longshore work) should be paid the current wage (mean wage paid to a person employed in a similar occupation in the respective area of employment).
*Permanent Employment of Aliens should be employed after the employer has agreed to provide and pay as per the prevailing wage trends. It should be decided on the basis of one of the many alternatives provisioned under the said Act. This rule has to be followed the moment the Alien has been granted with permanent residency or the Alien has been admitted to the United States to take the required position.

==Legacy==

The proponents of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 argued that it would not significantly influence United States culture. President Johnson said it was &quot;not a revolutionary bill. It does not affect the lives of millions.&quot; Secretary of State Dean Rusk and other politicians, including Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), asserted that the bill would not affect the U.S. demographic mix. However, following the passage of the law, the ethnic composition of immigrants changed, altering the ethnic makeup of the U.S. with increased numbers of immigrants from Asia, Africa, the West Indies, and elsewhere in the Americas. The 1965 act also imposed the first cap on total immigration from the Americas, marking the first time numerical limitations were placed on immigration from Latin American countries, including Mexico. If the bill and its subsequent immigration waves since had not been passed, it is estimated by Pew Research that the U.S. would have been in 2015: 75% Non-Hispanic White, 14% Black, 8% Hispanic and less than 1% Asian.

In the twenty years following passage of the law, 25,000 professional Filipino workers, including thousands of nurses, entered the U.S. under the law&#x27;s occupational provision.Family reunification under the law greatly increased the total number of immigrants, including Europeans, admitted to the U.S.; Between 1960 and 1975, 20,000 Italians arrived annually to join relatives who had earlier immigrated. Total immigration doubled between 1965 and 1970, and again between 1970 and 1990. Immigration constituted 11 percent of the total U.S. population growth between 1960 and 1970, growing to 33 percent from 1970 to 1980, and to 39 percent from 1980 to 1990. The percentage of foreign-born in the United States increased from 5 percent in 1965 to 14 percent in 2016.

The elimination of the National Origins Formula and the introduction of numeric limits on immigration from the Western Hemisphere, along with the strong demand for immigrant workers by U.S. employers, led to rising numbers of illegal immigrants in the U.S. in the decades after 1965, especially in the Southwest. Policies in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 that were designed to curtail migration across the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border led many unauthorized workers to settle permanently in the U.S. These demographic trends became a central part of anti-immigrant activism from the 1980s, leading to greater border militarization, rising apprehension of illegal immigrants by the Border Patrol, and a focus in the media on the criminality of illegal immigrants.

The Immigration and Nationality Act&#x27;s elimination of national and ethnic quotas has limited recent efforts at immigration restriction. In January 2017, President Donald Trump&#x27;s Executive Order 13769 temporarily halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations. However, lower federal courts ruled that the executive order violated the Immigration and Nationality Act&#x27;s prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of nationality and religion. In June 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court overrode both appeals courts and allowed the second ban to go into effect, but carved out an exemption for persons with &quot;bona fide relationships&quot; in the U.S. In December 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the full travel ban‚Äînow in its third incarnation‚Äîto take effect, which excludes people who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. In June 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban in &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot;, saying that the president&#x27;s power to secure the country&#x27;s borders, delegated by Congress over decades of immigration lawmaking, was not undermined by the president&#x27;s history of arguably incendiary statements about the dangers he said some Muslims pose to the United States.

<text>Sheet film is large format and medium format photographic film supplied on individual sheets of acetate or polyester film base rather than rolls. Sheet film was initially supplied as an alternative to glass plates. The most popular size measures ; smaller and larger sizes including the gigantic have been made and many are still available today.

== Using sheet film ==

To use sheet film, the photographer places a sheet of film, emulsion side out, into a film holder in the dark, and closes the dark slide over the loaded film. Next, the holder is inserted into a large-format camera, and the dark slide is removed from the holder. The exposure is made, the dark slide is replaced, and the film holder is removed from the camera.

== Notches ==
Sheet films have notches cut into one short side. This makes it simple to determine which side is the emulsion, when the film is hidden from sight (in the darkroom, or inside a changing bag). When holding the sheet in &quot;portrait&quot; orientation (short side up), with the notches in the upper right, the emulsion side is facing the photographer. The notch patterns vary in size and layout; each type of film has its own distinct pattern, commonly referred to as a notch code, to enable film type identification.

== Developing sheet film ==
Many photographers who use large-format cameras and sheet film do their own film processing. Some more professionally oriented photographic labs will process color negative and positive sheet film, but the &quot;corner drug store&quot; photolab generally can not. There are multiple methods that can be used.

=== Tray processing ===
The simplest method for processing sheet film is using trays. The equipment, one darkroom tray per processing solution, is easily available and inexpensive compared to most of the other methods. There is also a much lower volume of solution required when using trays - only what is needed to cover the films (though most film development chemicals have minimum solution-volume-per-film-area requirements, which may require use of more solution). The films are placed into the chemical-filled trays one every few seconds, and a stack of films is formed. Agitation is performed by &quot;shuffling&quot; the films; the sheet on the bottom of the stack is brought to the top and pushed down into the solution. The photographer shuffles through the stack at the same rate that they introduced the films into the processing chemical. With careful counting and practiced hands, a photographer can process as many as 10 sheets of film at one time.

Some metal multi-sheet film frames are available for handling multiple sheets as one; they require larger trays than the stacking methods, and generally preclude any stacking for risk of film damage.

The drawbacks of tray processing are that the photographer must spend the entirety of the processing time in the dark, with their hands in the various chemicals (some wear gloves, but they can reduce the ability to feel the individual sheets of film). Some photographers also have problems with scratching of the film&#x27;s emulsion when using this method.

=== Tank processing ===
Tank processing is also referred to as &quot;deep tank&quot; processing or &quot;dip and dunk&quot; processing. The equipment requirements are greater than for tray processing; a tank for each processing solution is required, along with film hangers for each sheet of film the photographer wishes to process. A film hanger is a metal frame with perforated edges which holds a single sheet or multiple sheets (usually four) of film. The films are inserted into the film hangers, and then submerged into the tank. Agitation is performed by lifting the hangers out of the tank, tilting them to one side to allow them to drain for a brief moment, resubmerging them, lifting and tilting to the other side, and resubmerging. Many photographers will bang or tap the hangers on the tank&#x27;s top after the second tilt, to dislodge any air bubbles that have stuck to the film.

Tanks are also helpful for long development techniques such as &quot;stand&quot; development. Stand development is very individualized, and every practitioner has his or her own routine, but in general, after an initial agitation in the developer, film is simply allowed to stand motionless in (generally highly dilute) developer, with no agitation, for very long intervals, up to hours.

Large tank processing has higher equipment requirements, and a larger volume of solution is required for each step. A tank for film can require 2 litres (64 ounces) of chemistry, and most tanks for film require from to . Many large tanks come with floating lids to reduce possible oxidation of solution. Also, despite such large chemical volumes, some tanks do not allow very many films to be processed at a single time; generally six to ten or so. However, film hangers that hold four sheets of film when used in larger tanks can process many sheets of film at the same time. Tank processing, like using trays, must also be performed in the dark. Some photographers report uneven development using this method.

There are also daylight tanks accepting sheet film, usually adjustable to multiple existing sheet formats - e. g. inch and metric, and allowing the processing the sheet film in daylight. They have to be loaded in the dark, though. The stainless steel Nikor tank accepts up to 12 sheets of film, 4x5&quot; size maximum, and requires about 1 liter of chemistry. These tanks have long been discontinued, and are only available used. Some people report uneven development and emulsion scratching with this device (a result of steel &quot;spider&quot; presence, separating the sheets in tank&#x27;s &quot;cage&quot; ), but many users get excellent results with it - the right loading and infrequent agitation are perhaps the keys to success. The current make plastic Combi-Plan tank accepts up to 6 sheets of film, and works nicely, though the overall quality of manufacture is not too high, and the tank has a number of small plastic details, easy to break or lose. But this tank is also quite capable of excellent performance.

=== Rotary tube processing ===
With rotary processing, films are loaded into tubes for processing. The solutions are poured or pumped into the tubes, which are turned on their sides and spun, sometimes by hand, and sometimes by a motorized base or machine. The simplest form of rotary processing is to use one tube per film; no extra reel or complex film-holding device is needed. The film is loaded, solution added, tube closed, and the tube is spun, by hand, floating in a water bath. The direction of spin is normally reversed after a couple of spins. Some rotary tubes utilize reels to hold multiple films inside the tube.

Some rotary systems use a motor to do the spinning, instead of the photographer. These systems sometimes have variable rotation speeds, and will reverse direction automatically. Systems such as these are quite convenient; they require nothing of the photographer other than changing the solution at the appropriate time. Some more complex systems can even do the chemistry management, requiring nothing but a simple programming step.

Benefits of rotary systems are even development, and very low solution requirements in some cases. However, they can also require the use of more chemistry than normally needed when only a couple sheets are processed in a tube that has the capacity to hold more sheets because the a minimum amount of chemistry is required for the tube to work properly. Processing can be accomplished with the lights on with almost all rotary tube processing systems because they have light-tight covers. The photographer can also generally keep his/her hands free of chemistry, since the solutions are enclosed in the tubes. Also, since many rotary systems have or use a water bath, the bath can be temperature-controlled, resulting in very consistent results across different processing runs.

Drawbacks with a one-film-per-tube method is that processing any amount of film can take a very long time; it is difficult to keep up with more than one or two tubes at a time. Also, a mechanized rotary system, depending on its features and capabilities, can be very expensive.

== Benefits ==
Sheet film is, simply enough, big, and as such has a proportionately great ability to hold information. The image on a piece of sheet film has approximately fifty-six times the surface area of a standard 35mm image. As compared to megapixels, when taking the LP/mm resolution of 8x10 Velvia the resolution is up to a value of 5,285 megapixels. In theory, the &quot;enlargability&quot; of such an image is proportionately great although the very high image quality of small format lenses sometimes allows somewhat greater magnifications than some large format lenses. However, this is not always the case. Sheet film can be enlarged to poster, or even billboard, size with acceptable quality. It is far easier to do retouching directly on the surface of a sheet of film since the images are large, than on smaller formats. Many of the larger formats can be contact printed, and for some ultra-large formats, are &quot;only&quot; contact printed.

Each sheet can receive individualized processing. Since each exposure is its own sheet, it is possible to alter development, based on the contrast of the photographed scene, to best fit the dynamic range of the subject. Because of this, many large-format photographers are also practitioners of the Zone System.

Because of the large size and very manual single-use nature of sheet films, it is possible to use a single sheet for more than one exposure. Using a dark slide which has been cut in half, turning a standard format into a long, skinny panoramic format is simple and very cost effective. While the holder is in the camera, the photographer removes the complete dark slide and inserts the half slide, then makes an exposure on half the sheet. The half dark slide is flipped over, and the other half of the film is available for a second shot. The practice originated with photographers taking pictures of groups of banquet attendees, giving these &quot;banquet&quot; formats their name. are the most commonly used of these formats. However, specialized large format banquet cameras were often used for this purpose. They rotated on a stand while exposing the film in a pass from one edge to the other. Jokesters often took advantage of this by getting on the end of the line of people being photographed and then running behind the group of people and standing on the other end of the line so that they show up on both ends of the resulting picture.

== Availability ==

Despite the advancement of digital imaging, the market for sheet film is still healthy and thriving. As of August 2023, Eastman Kodak and Fujifilm manufacture black-and-white, color negative and color transparency sheet films. Ilford and Foma manufacture black-and-white negative sheet films (Efke, in Croatia, ceased production in June, 2012).

== Handling and film holders ==
: &quot;For more complete information, see the film holder article&quot;

Most large format film is used double filmholders which, as the name implies, hold one sheet of film on each side of the holder. The holders must be loaded and unloaded in the dark to protect film from premature exposure.

Some films were previously available in single-shot, pre-loaded, disposable envelopes which can be conveniently loaded into a special film holder in daylight (Kodak Readyload and Fuji Quickload). Each manufacturer made a film holder for its system&#x27;s envelopes; the Polaroid 545/545i instant film holders also worked with both systems&#x27; films. In addition to eliminating dust problems, these daylight-loading systems reduced the amount of gear a photographer needed to carry to only a single film holder. However, as of 2014, no manufacturer offers quick-loading envelopes.

There were several devices manufactured which held several (6-10) sheets of film in individual holders stacked like a pack of cards, and which then shuffled the front holder to the back of the unit after exposure. These devices included the Graflex Grafmatic, Graflex Film Magazine, Burke &amp; James Kinematic, and Fuji QuickChange devices. They were very popular with photojournalists who often had to take several shots in rapid succession.

In the mid-20th century, some sheet film sizes, including medium format, were made in &quot;film packs&quot; of 12 to 16 exposures, which are thin sheets of film and folded into a rectangular pack which was placed in a pack holder camera back.

Some large format cameras have rotating or sliding reduction backs, which mask off part of the film sheet, allowing several smaller photos to be placed on a single sheet of film.

<text>Ernest Louis Octave Courtot de Cissey (; 1810‚Äì1882) was a French general and Prime Minister.

==Biography==
Ernest Courtot de Cissey was born in Paris, educated at the Prytan√©e National Militaire and, after passing through St Cyr, entered the army in 1832, becoming captain in 1839.
He saw active service in Algeria, and became &quot;chef d&#x27;escadron&quot; in 1849 and lieutenant-colonel in 1850. He took part as a colonel in the Crimean War, and after the battle of Inkerman received the rank of general of brigade.

In 1863 he was promoted general of division. When the Franco-German War broke out in 1870, de Cissey was given a divisional command in the Army of the Rhine, and he was included in the surrender of Bazaine&#x27;s army at Metz. He was released from captivity only at the end of the war, and on his return was at once appointed by the Versailles government to a command in the army engaged in the suppression of the Commune.

From July 1871 de Cissey sat as a deputy, and he had already become minister of war. He occupied this post several times during the critical period of the reorganization of the French army, and served briefly as Prime Minister of France from 1874 to 1875. In 1875, he was elected senator for life. In 1880, whilst holding the command of the XI corps at Nantes, he was accused of having relations with a certain Baroness Lucie von Kaulla (1840‚Äì1891?), a descendant of Karoline Kaulla, who was said to be a spy in the pay of Germany, and he was in consequence relieved from duty. An inquiry subsequently held resulted in de Cissey&#x27;s favour (1881).

<doc id="331311" wikidata="Q1358870" url="?curid=331311" title="Queen of Heaven">
<text>Queen of Heaven () is a title given by the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy, to Mary, mother of Jesus, and, to a lesser extent, in Anglicanism and Lutheranism. The title has long been a tradition, included in prayers and devotional literature and seen in Western art in the subject of the Coronation of the Virgin from the High Middle Ages, long before the Church gave it a formal definition status.

The Catholic teaching on this subject is expressed in the papal encyclical &quot;Ad Caeli Reginam&quot;, issued by Pope Pius XII in 1954. Therein, the pope states that Mary is called Queen of Heaven because her son, Jesus Christ, was charged as being &quot;King of Israel&quot; and the heavenly king of the universe. This would render the mother of the king as the &quot;queen mother&quot; of Israel.

==Theological basis==

Queen of Heaven () is one of many queen titles used for Mary, mother of Jesus. The title derived in part from the ancient Catholic teaching that Mary, at the end of her earthly life, was bodily and spiritually assumed into heaven and that she is there honored as queen.

Pius XII explained the theological reasons for her title of Queen in a radio message to Fatima of May 13, 1946, &quot;Bendito seja&quot;:
In his 1954 encyclical &quot;Ad Caeli Reginam&quot; &quot;To the Queen of Heaven&quot;, Pius XII asserts that Mary deserves the title because she is the Theotokos &quot;mother of God&quot;, because she is closely associated as the New Eve with Jesus&#x27; redemptive work, because of her preeminent perfection and because of her intercessory power. &quot;Ad caeli reginam&quot; states that the main principle on which the royal dignity of Mary rests is her divine motherhood, and thus John of Damascus wrote, &quot;When she became Mother of the Creator, she truly became Queen of every creature.&quot;

== Biblical basis ==

In the Hebrew Bible some Davidic kings had in their court a &quot;gebirah&quot; (&quot;Great Lady&quot;) who was often their mother, and held great power as his advisor and an advocate to him. In 1 Kings 2:20, Solomon said to his mother Bathsheba, seated on a throne at his right, &quot;Make your request, Mother, for I will not refuse you.&quot; William G. Most sees here a sort of type of Mary.

In the New Testament, the title has several biblical sources. At the Annunciation, the archangel Gabriel announces that [Jesus] &quot;... will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David. He will rule over the house of Jacob forever and his reign will be without end.&quot;(Luke 1:32) The biblical precedent in ancient Israel is that the mother of the king becomes the queen mother. Mary&#x27;s queenship is a share in Jesus‚Äô kingship.

==Historical practice==

The Catholic Church from the earliest times venerated the Queen of Heaven, according to Pius XII:

In the first three centuries of Christianity, Mary&#x27;s queenship was popularized by the &quot;Transitus&quot; literature, that, according to Stephen Shoemaker, has its origins before the Council of Nicaea. Origen of Alexandria called Mary &quot;my Lady&quot;, in his &quot;Hom VII in Lucam&quot; (PG 13:1902D), which is a royal title.

In the fourth century, Ephrem the Syrian called Mary &quot;Lady&quot; and &quot;Queen&quot;. Later Church fathers and doctors continued to use the title. Similarly, Gregory of Nyssa in his &quot;Sermo de Annuntiatione&quot; (PG 62: 766) called her &quot;Lady&quot; (Œ¥Œ≠œÉœÄŒøŒπŒΩŒ±ŒΩ). This title also appears in many other early writers, e.g., Jerome, and Peter Chrysologus. The first Mariological definition and basis for the title of &quot;Mary Queen of Heaven&quot; developed at the Council of Ephesus, where Mary was defined to be the Mother of God. The members of the Council specifically approved this version against the opinion, that Mary is &quot;only&quot; the mother of Jesus. Nobody, they ruled, had participated in the life of her son more than Mary, who gave birth to the Son of God.

The word &quot;Queen&quot; is common during and after the sixth century. Hymns of the 11th to 13th centuries address Mary as queen: ‚ÄúHail, Holy Queen,‚Äù ‚ÄúHail, Queen of Heaven,‚Äù ‚ÄúQueen of Heaven‚Äù. The Dominican rosary and the Franciscan crown, as well as numerous invocations in Mary‚Äôs litany, celebrate her queenship. For centuries she has been invoked as the Queen of Heaven.

During the English Reformation, the title &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;, while eliminated from state-approved liturgy, became a symbol of resistance.

==Litany of Loreto==
She is invoked in the Litany of Loreto as:

* Queen of the Angels
* Queen of Patriarchs
* Queen of Prophets
* Queen of Apostles
* Queen of Martyrs
* Queen of Confessors
* Queen of Virgins
* Queen of all Saints
* Queen of Families
* Queen conceived without original sin
* Queen assumed into Heaven
* Queen of the Most Holy Rosary
* Queen of Peace

=== Other titles ===

The Second Vatican Council in 1964 referred to Mary as &quot;Queen of the Universe&quot;.

== Liturgy of the Hours ==
Three of the four ancient Marian antiphons of the Liturgy of the Hours (the &quot;Salve Regina&quot;, the &quot;Ave Regina caelorum&quot;, the &quot;Alma Redemptoris Mater&quot;, and the &quot;Regina Caeli&quot;), address Mary as queen. These are prayed at different times of the year, at the end of Compline.

=== &quot;Salve Regina&quot; ===
Mary as Queen of Heaven is praised in the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (&quot;Hail Queen&quot;), which is sung in the time from Trinity Sunday until the Saturday before the first Sunday of Advent. It is attributed to a German Benedictine monk, Hermann of Reichenau (1013‚Äì1054). Traditionally it has been sung in Latin, though many translations exist. In the Middle Ages, &quot;Salve Regina&quot; offices were held every Saturday. In the 13th century, the custom developed to greet the Queen of Heaven with the &quot;Salve Regina&quot;, which is considered the oldest of the four Marian antiphons. As a part of the Catholic Reformation, the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; was prayed every Saturday by members of the Sodality of Our Lady, a Jesuit Marian association. The &quot;Hail Holy Queen&quot; is also the final prayer of the Rosary.

=== &quot;Ave Regina caelorum&quot; ===
The &quot;Ave Regina caelorum&quot; (&quot;Hail, Queen of Heaven&quot;) is an early Marian antiphon, praising Mary, the Queen of Heaven. It is traditionally said or sung after each of the canonical hours of the Liturgy of the Hours. The prayer was once used after Compline, the final canonical hour of prayer before going to sleep, from the Feast of the Presentation (February 2) through the Wednesday of Holy Week. It is now used in the Liturgy of the Hours on the feast of the Assumption of Mary. The &quot;Ave Regina caelorum&quot; dates back in a different musical intonation to the 12th century. Today&#x27;s version is slightly different from a 12th-century intonation. The &quot;Ave Regina caelorum&quot; has four parts: &quot;Ave&quot;, &quot;Salve&quot;, &quot;Gaude&quot; and &quot;Vale&quot; (in English: hail, rejoice, farewell). It was used for processions in honour of the &quot;Queen of Heaven.&quot; The &quot;Ave Regina caelorum&quot; received numerous musical versions, a famous one of which was composed in 1773 by Joseph Haydn.

===&quot;Regina Caeli&quot;===

The &quot;Regina Caeli&quot; (&quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;) is an anthem of the Catholic Church which replaces the &quot;Angelus&quot; during Eastertide, the fifty days from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday. It is named for its opening words in Latin. Of unknown authorship, the anthem has been traced back to the twelfth century. It was in Franciscan use, after Compline, in the first half of the thirteenth century.

Different musical settings of the words were composed throughout the centuries by known and unknown composers. Not all attributions are correct, as an often quoted &quot;Regina Caeli&quot; by Joseph Haydn was not by him.

==Veneration==
The small and simple young girl of Nazareth became Queen of the world! This is one of the marvels that reveal God‚Äôs Heart. Of course, Mary‚Äôs queenship is totally relative to Christ‚Äôs kingship. He is the Lord whom after the humiliation of death on the Cross the Father exalted above any other creature in Heaven and on earth and under the earth (cf. Phil 2: 9-11). Through a design of grace, the Immaculate Mother was fully associated with the mystery of the Son: in his Incarnation; in his earthly life, at first hidden at Nazareth and then manifested in the messianic ministry; in his Passion and death; and finally, in the glory of his Resurrection and Ascension into Heaven ... Benedict XVI.

The Queenship of Mary is commemorated in the last of the Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary‚Äîthe Coronation of the Virgin as Queen of Heaven and Earth.

Parishes and private groups often process and crown an image of Mary with flowers. This often is referred to as a &quot;May Crowning&quot;. This rite may be done on solemnities and feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or other festive days, and offers the Church a chance to reflect on Mary‚Äôs role in the history of salvation.

The Virgin has been called &quot;Queen of France&quot; since 1638 when, partly in thanksgiving for a victory over the Huguenots and also in hope of the birth of an heir after years of childless marriage, Louis XIII officially gave her that title. Siena, Tuscany, hails the Virgin as Queen of Siena, and annually observes the race and pageant called the &quot;palio&quot; in her honor.

Mary was declared &quot;Queen of Poland&quot; by king John II Casimir during the Lw√≥w Oath in the 17th century. Since then she is believed to save the country miraculously during Deluge, Partitions of Poland, Polish-Soviet War, World War II and the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. The solemnity of Our Lady Queen of Poland is celebrated on 3 May.

===Feast of Queenship of Mary===
&quot;Queenship of Mary&quot; is a Marian feast day in the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church, created by Pope Pius XII. On 11 October 1954, the pontiff pronounced the new feast in his encyclical &quot;Ad caeli reginam&quot;. The feast was celebrated on May 31, the last day of the Marian month. The initial ceremony for this feast involved the crowning of the &quot;Salus Populi Romani&quot; icon of Mary in Rome by Pius XII as part of a procession in Rome.

In 1969, Pope Paul VI moved the feast day to August 22, the former Octave day of the Assumption in order to emphasize the close bond between Mary&#x27;s queenship and her glorification in body and soul next to her Son. The Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Constitution on the Church states that &quot;Mary was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by the Lord as Queen of the universe, that she might be the more fully conformed to her Son&quot; (&quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, 59).

The movement to officially recognise the Queenship of Mary was initially promoted by several Catholic Mariological congresses in Lyon, France; Freiburg, Germany; and Einsiedeln, Switzerland. Gabriel Roschini founded in Rome, Italy, an international society to promote the Queenship of Mary, &quot;Pro Regalitate Mariae&quot;. Several popes had described Mary as Queen and Queen of Heaven, which was documented by Roschini. Pope Pius XII repeated the title in numerous encyclicals and apostolic letters, especially during World War II.

===Marian processions===
In Los Angeles, California, a Marian procession took place annually for roughly the first 100 years following the founding of the city. In an attempt to revive the custom of religious processions, in September 2011 the Queen of Angels Foundation, founded by Mark Anchor Albert, inaugurated an annual &quot;Grand Marian Procession&quot; in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles&#x27; historic core. This yearly procession, intended to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of the City of Los Angeles, begins outside of the parish of La Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de los Angeles which is part of the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District, better known as &quot;La Placita&quot;. By way of city streets, the procession eventually terminates at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels where a public Rosary and Mass in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary are offered. Subsequent years have seen the involvement and participation of numerous chivalric, fraternal, and religious orders, parishes, lay groups, political figures, as well as other religious and civic organizations.

== Art ==


Early Christian art shows Mary in an elevated position. She carries her divine son in her hands, or holds him. The earliest known Roman depiction of &quot;Santa Maria Regina&quot; depicting Mary as a queen dates to the 6th century and is found in the modest church of Santa Maria Antiqua built in the 5th century in the Forum Romanum. Here Mary is unequivocally depicted as an empress. As one of the earliest Catholic Marian churches, this church was used by Pope John VII in the early 8th century as the &quot;see of the bishop of Rome&quot;. Also in the 8th century, the Second Council of Nicaea decreed that such pictures of Mary should be venerated.

In the early 16th century, Protestant reformers began to discourage Marian art, and some like John Calvin or Zwingli even encouraged its destruction. But after the Council of Trent in the mid-16th century confirmed the veneration of Marian paintings for Catholics, Mary was often painted as a Madonna with crown, surrounded by stars, standing on top of the world or the partly visible moon. After the victory against the Turks at Lepanto, Mary is depicted as the Queen of Victory, sometimes wearing the crown of the Habsburg empire. National interpretations existed in France as well, where Jean Fouquet painted the Queen of Heaven in 1450 with the face of the mistress of King Charles VII. Statues and pictures of Mary were crowned by kings in Poland, France, Bavaria, Hungary and Austria, sometimes apparently using crowns previously worn by earthly monarchs. A surviving small crown presented by Margaret of York seems to have been that worn by her at her wedding to Charles the Bold in 1463. A recent coronation was that of the picture of the &quot;Salus Populi Romani&quot; in 1954 by Pius XII. The veneration of Mary as queen continues into the 21st century, but artistic expressions do not have the leading role as in previous times.

Artworks, including paintings, mosaics and carvings of the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven, became increasingly popular from the 13th century onward. Works follow a set pattern, showing Mary kneeling in the heavenly court, and being crowned either by Jesus alone, or else by Jesus and God the Father together, with the Holy Spirit, usually in the form of a dove, completing the Trinity. The Coronation of Mary is almost entirely a theme of Western art. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, although Mary is often shown wearing a crown, the coronation itself never became an accepted artistic subject.
