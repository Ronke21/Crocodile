The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shinjō has declined in recent decades.

==History==

The rivers and deciduous forests around Shinjo have provided sufficient game and edible plants for human habitation since prehistoric times. Fragments of pottery and flints from the Jomon period (12,000 BC – 400 BC) continue to be found on building sites.

Two notable earthenware Jomon figures that are Nationally Designated Cultural Properties were found near Shinjo. One is a 4,500 year-old clay figure of a woman (45 cm) referred to as the Venus of the Jomon period (縄文時代の女神), excavated in Funagata Town. The other is the approximately 3,000 year-old Keppatsu Dogou 結髪土偶 (23.4 cm) found in Kamebuchi, Mamurogawa.

During the Yayoi period (400 BC – 300 AD) rice cultivation spread to the area now called Yamagata.

In 712, when Nara became the capital of Japan, the Dewa district was separated from Echigo Province to establish the Dewa Province. Later, the districts of Mogami (present day Mogami and Murayama) and the Okitama district of Mutsu Province were incorporated into Dewa Province.

Dewa Province had roughly the same borders as present-day Yamagata Prefecture, plus much of present-day Akita Prefecture, and Kinowanosaku Castle in Sakata City is believed to have been the center of the Dewa Province government.

Several important temples in Yamagata were founded during this period, including religious centers established by mountain ascetics on the three sacred mountains known as the Dewa Sanzan.

From the Asuka period (538–710) through the Heian period (794–1192), Yamagata had been shifting towards inclusion in the centralized government located in Kyoto and Nara. However, near the end of the Heian period, conflict arose and Yamagata was recognized as being under the rule of the Oshu Fujiwara Clan. Legends about the famous warrior, Minamoto Yoshitsune, have been passed down in the Shonai and Mogami regions of Yamagata ever since.

At the start of the Kamakura period (1192–1333), the Oshu Fujiwara Clan were defeated by the Kanto Bushi warriors. This led to the Oe Clan (including the Sagae Clan and Nagai Clan) controlling the regions of Murayama and Okitama, and the Mutou Clan (including the Daihoji Clan) controlling the Shonai region.

At the start of the Muromachi period (1338–1573), during the era of conflict between the Northern and Southern Imperial Courts, the Shiba Clan, based in what is now northern Miyagi Prefecture, ruled the Oshu region. In 1356, they dispatched Shiba Kaneyori to govern the Ushu area of Yamagata. The Shiba Clan established its base in Mogami (now Yamagata City). They changed the clan name from Shiba to Mogami and expanded control over the region. During the Warring States period (15th–17th centuries), Mogami Yoshiaki (最上義光) moved his forces northward and expanded the Mogami Clan&#x27;s territory to include the Murayama, Mogami, and Shonai regions.

The decisive battle of Sekigahara (1600) resulted in the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the final feudal regime to rule over Japan. Under the Tokugawa Shogunate, most of Yamagata was controlled by the great feudal lord Mogami Yoshiaki. The Mogami fief became the fifth largest in Japan, excluding lands held by the Tokugawa. Mogami Yoshiaki developed flood control of the Mogami River to allow for safer navigation and for irrigation to increase rice farming. He also reconstructed and expanded Yamagata Castle and the surrounding castle town.

Mogami Yoshiaki died at Yamagata Castle in 1614. Internal struggles for control within the Tokugawa Shogunate resulted in the1622 seizure of most of the Mogami Clan territory. The Mogami family survived and still exists as a koke (高家).
The area formerly administered by the Mogami Clan was divided into regions directly ruled or controlled by feudal lords close to the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Sakai Clan was given control of the Shonai region, and the Tozawa Clan controlled the Shinjo region until the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1868.

Shipments of products, especially rice and Mogami safflower (used for the classic Japanese red dye), led to a flourishing trade along the Mogami River and Sakata became one of the most active ports along the Sea of Japan. Remarkably, the Honma family of Sakata, rich from the shipping business 北船, were for a time the biggest landowners in all Japan.

In 1871, when clans were abolished and prefectures established, Yamagata was initially divided into seven separate areas (Yamagata, Yonezawa, Kaminoyama, Tendo, Shinjo, Oizumi and Matsumine). In 1876 these districts were finally merged to create Yamagata Prefecture.

During the Edo period, present-day Shinjō was the center of the Shinjō Domain, a 65,000 koku Tokugawa feudal domain controlled by the Tozawa Clan (1622–1871) who built Shinjō Castle. Part of the stone wall and the moat are all that remain of the castle that was completely destroyed in the Battle of Shinjō during the Boshin War for the Meiji restoration.

From 1878, the area was administered as Shinjō Town within the Mogami District of Yamagata Prefecture and prospered as a center for horse farms providing mounts for Imperial Japanese Army cavalry regiments. Shinjo was not bombed during World War II except for a single air raid that killed six people.

Shinjō became a city on April 1, 1946, merging with the neighboring villages of Hagino on April 1, 1955, and Yamuki on September 30, 1956. Shinjo Station first opened in 1903 with the extension of the (奥羽本線, Ōu-honsen) rail line from Yamagata City. Shinjo is the terminus for the Tohoku Shinkansen and a transportation hub with four railway lines.

==Economy==
The economy of Shinjō is based on light manufacturing, agriculture and wood products.

==Government==
Shinjō has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members. The city contributes two members to the Yamagata Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Yamagata District 2 of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Education==
Shinjō has six public elementary schools and four public middle schools operated by the city government and three public high schools operated by the Yamagata Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

===Shinjō Matsuri===
One of the premier festivals of Yamagata Prefecture, Shinjō Matsuri (or Shinjō Festival) is a summer-time celebration held annually from August 24–26. Held since 1755, the festival was established by the local &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord) to lift the spirits of the common people after a particularly bad harvest. The current incarnation of the festival includes traditional dancing, a reenactment of the first &quot;&quot;Daimyō&quot; Parade&quot;, traditional festival vending stalls, and the &quot;Yattai&quot; Parade, in which each neighborhood in the city constructs large, vivid scenes from Japanese/local history, folklore, and/or fairy tales on wide floats. These are then pulled throughout the city by children both at day and at night for the three days of the festival. A traditional &quot;hayashi band&quot; of &quot;taiko&quot; drums, cymbals, &quot;shamisen&quot;, and Japanese flute follow behind. The hands, feet, and faces of the figures on the floats are based on traditional Noh design. The floats are judged and the three winners displayed in Shinjō Station, and the Shinjō History Center. The rest are dismantled. In 2017, the Shinjō Matsuri was added to the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.

<text>The Common Object File Format (COFF) is a format for executable, object code, and shared library computer files used on Unix systems. It was introduced in Unix System V, replaced the previously used a.out format, and formed the basis for extended specifications such as XCOFF and ECOFF, before being largely replaced by ELF, introduced with SVR4. 
COFF and its variants continue to be used on some Unix-like systems, on Microsoft Windows (Portable Executable), in UEFI environments and in some embedded development systems.

==History==
The original Unix object file format a.out is unable to adequately support shared libraries, foreign format identification, or explicit address linkage. As development of Unix-like systems continued both inside and outside AT&amp;T, different solutions to these and other issues emerged.

COFF was introduced in 1983, in AT&amp;T&#x27;s UNIX System V for non-VAX 32-bit platforms such as the 3B20. Improvements over the existing AT&amp;T &quot;a.out&quot; format included arbitrary sections, explicit processor declarations, and explicit address linkage.

However, the COFF design was both too limited and incompletely specified: there was a limit on the maximum number of sections, a limit on the length of section names, included source files, and the symbolic debugging information was incapable of supporting real world languages such as C, much less newer languages like C++, or new processors. All real world implementations of COFF were necessarily violations of the standard as a result. This led to numerous COFF extensions. IBM used the XCOFF format in AIX; DEC, SGI and others used ECOFF; and numerous SysV ports and tool chains targeting embedded development each created their own, incompatible, variations.

With the release of SVR4, AT&amp;T replaced COFF with ELF.

While extended versions of COFF continue to be used for some Unix and Unix-like platforms, primarily in embedded systems, perhaps the most widespread use of the COFF format today is in Microsoft&#x27;s Portable Executable (PE) format. Developed for Windows NT, the PE format (sometimes written as PE/COFF) uses a COFF header for object files, and as a component of the PE header for executable files.

==Features==
COFF&#x27;s main improvement over &quot;a.out&quot; was the introduction of multiple named sections in the object file. Different object files could have different numbers and types of sections.

===Symbolic debugging information===
The COFF symbolic debugging information consists of symbolic (string) names for program functions and variables, and line number information, used for setting breakpoints and tracing execution.

Symbolic names are stored in the COFF symbol table. Each symbol table entry includes a name, storage class, type, value and section number. Short names (8 characters or fewer) are stored directly in the symbol table; longer names are stored as an offset into the string table at the end of the COFF object.

Storage classes describe the type entity the symbol represents, and may include external variables (C_EXT), automatic (stack) variables (C_AUTO), register variables (C_REG), functions (C_FCN), and many others. The symbol type describes the interpretation of the symbol entity&#x27;s value and includes values for all the C data types.

When compiled with appropriate options, a COFF object file will contain line number information for each possible break point in the text section of the object file. Line number information takes two forms: in the first, for each possible break point in the code, the line number table entry records the address and its matching line number. In the second form, the entry identifies a symbol table entry representing the start of a function, enabling a breakpoint to be set using the function&#x27;s name.

Note that COFF was not capable of representing line numbers or debugging symbols for included source as with header files rendering the COFF debugging information virtually useless without incompatible extensions.

===Relative virtual address===
When a COFF file is generated, it is not usually known where in memory it will be loaded. The virtual address where the first byte of the file will be loaded is called image base address. The rest of the file is not necessarily loaded in a contiguous block, but in different sections.

Relative virtual addresses (RVAs) are not to be confused with standard virtual addresses. A relative virtual address is the virtual address of an object from the file once it is loaded into memory, minus the base address of the file image. If the file were to be mapped literally from disk to memory, the RVA would be the same as that of the offset into the file, but this is actually quite unusual.

Note that the RVA term is only used with objects in the image file. Once loaded into memory, the image base address is added, and ordinary VAs are used.

==Problems==

The COFF file header stores the date and time that the object file was created as a 32-bit binary integer, representing the number of seconds since the Unix epoch, 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Dates occurring after 19 January 2038 cannot be stored in this format, resulting in an instance of the year 2038 problem.

<doc id="328326" wikidata="Q561186" url="?curid=328326" title="Frits Bolkestein">
<text>Frederik &quot;Frits&quot; Bolkestein (; 4 April 1933 – 17 February 2025) was a Dutch politician and energy executive who served as Leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) from 1990 to 1998 and European Commissioner for Internal Market from 1999 until 2004 under Romano Prodi. 

Bolkestein worked as a corporate director for Royal Dutch Shell from May 1960 until July 1976 and as a manager for an engineering company in Amsterdam from September 1976 until January 1978. Bolkestein became a member of the House of Representatives shortly after election of 1977 taking office on 16 January 1978 serving as a frontbencher and spokesman for Economic Affairs. After the election of 1982 Bolkestein was appointed State Secretary for Economic Affairs in the Cabinet Lubbers I taking office on 5 November 1982. After the election of 1986 Bolkestein was not offered a cabinet post in the new cabinet and returned to the House of Representatives on 3 June 1986 serving as a frontbencher and spokesman for Foreign Affairs and International trade. Bolkestein was appointed Minister of Defence in the Cabinet Lubbers II following a cabinet reshuffle taking office on 24 September 1988. After the election of 1989 Bolkestein again returned to the House of Representatives on 14 September 1989. Shortly after the election, party leader and parliamentary leader Joris Voorhoeve announced he was stepping down and Bolkestein announced his candidacy to succeed and was selected as his successor on 30 April 1990.

For the election of 1994, Bolkestein served as &quot;lijsttrekker&quot; (top candidate) and following a successful cabinet formation with Labour Leader Wim Kok and fellow Liberal Leader Hans van Mierlo formed the Cabinet Kok I with Bolkestein opting to remain as Parliamentary leader. Bolkestein also served as President of the Liberal International from 15 April 1996 until 18 April 2000. For the election of 1998 Bolkestein again served as &quot;lijsttrekker&quot; (top candidate) but shortly thereafter announced that he was stepping down on 30 July 1998 but continued to serve in the House of Representatives as a backbencher. In August 1999 Bolkestein was nominated as the next European Commissioner in the Prodi Commission, and was given the heavy portfolios of Internal Market and Services and Taxation and Customs serving from 16 September 1999 until 22 November 2004.

==Early life and career==
Frederik Bolkestein was born on 4 April 1933 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. His father was president of the Court in Amsterdam. His grandfather, Gerrit Bolkestein, was Minister of Education, Arts, and Sciences to the Dutch government-in-exile of 1939 to 1945. Bolkestein&#x27;s mother was born in the Dutch East Indies to Dutch parents.

Bolkestein attended the Barlaeus Gymnasium in Amsterdam from 1945 to 1951, where he majored in both arts and sciences. Upon completing his gymnasium education, he was an undergraduate in mathematics at Oregon State College from 1951 to 1953. Subsequently, he went to the University of Amsterdam, where he received a BSc degree in mathematics and physics in 1955. In 1959, he received a MA degree in philosophy and Greek from the same university. Bolkestein went on to earn a BSc degree from The London School of Economics in 1963, and an LLM degree from Leiden University in 1965.

During his studies in Amsterdam, Bolkestein was editor for the satirical student magazine &quot;Propria Cures&quot;. He was also a member of the board of the student union ASVA.

Before entering Dutch politics, Bolkestein worked for the oil company Royal Dutch Shell from 1960 to 1975. During this period he was assigned to postings in East Africa, Honduras and El Salvador, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and France. In Paris, he served on the board of the Shell Chimie from 1973 to 1975. During his tenure with Shell, he completed the first part of the economics program at the London School of Economics in 1964 and he also completed a law degree at Leiden University, graduating in 1965.

In 1976, Bolkestein wrote an English language play named &quot;Floris, Count of Holland&quot;, under the anagrammatic pseudonym of Niels Kobet.

==Politics and later life==
Bolkestein left Shell in 1976 and became a member of parliament for the VVD. From 1982 to 1986, he served as Minister of International Trade. After joining the parliament again, he was Minister of Defence from 1988 to 1989. In 1990, he was elected Leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy of the VVD, a position he held until 1998. Between 1978 and 1999, when he became European Commissioner, he was member of parliament for 17 years.

During the 1990s, he was very successful as the political frontman of the VVD. As an opinion leader, he was known for his daring and controversial positions on such issues as multicultural problems in Dutch society, political dualism between government and parliament, and the structure and expansion of the European Union. From 1990 to 1994 he was the parliamentary opposition leader and continued his outspoken and independent style when his party was part of the government from 1994. During the provincial elections of 1995, his criticism of Dutch immigration policies made his party the largest of the country.

In 1996, his political integrity came under heavy criticism, because it was revealed he had written a letter to Health Minister Els Borst, in which he asked her to help a pharmaceutical company, on whose board of commissioners Bolkestein sat. The incident was known as the &quot;Dear Els&quot;-incident, because the letter was addressed to Borst personally.

He was president of the Liberal International, the world federation of liberal political parties. As of Autumn 2004, he was a professor at the Dutch universities of Leiden and Delft. Former Irish finance minister Charlie McCreevy succeeded him as Commissioner for the Internal Market.

He authored a number of books on politics and related subjects. Frits Bolkestein was until his death married to Femke Boersma, a retired Dutch actress. In 2005, his house in northern France had its electricity cut briefly by the local energy company after he criticized French protectionist measures against incoming electricians from Eastern Europe.

In 2010 he was awarded the Prize for Liberty by the Flemish classical-liberal think tank Libera!. Also, he was on the advisory board of OMFIF where he was regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.

Bolkestein died in Laren on 17 February 2025, at the age of 91.

==Bolkestein Directive==
Named after Frits Bolkestein, the Directive on services in the internal market aims at enabling a company from a given member-state to recruit workers in other European Union countries using the law of its home country. It triggered huge protests in Europe. This directive was voted in the European Parliament in March 2006 and the MEPs proposed amendments to the provisional text. The &quot;principle of origin&quot;, which stipulates that workers are employed under the legal arrangements of their own state of residence, was replaced by a new &quot;freedom&quot; principle – freedom to provide services, meaning that administrative obstacles should be removed. The compromise allowed the draft Directive to continue to exist. However, there was a great deal of concern about its effect on social standards and welfare, triggering competition between various parts of Europe. This led to significant protests across Europe against the directive including a notable protest at the European Parliament in Strasbourg by port workers which led to damage to the building. MEPs eventually reached a compromise on the text and the Parliament adopted it on 12 December 2006; 2 years after Bolkestein left office, under the Barroso Commission.

==Controversies==

In 2001, Bolkestein responded to the question raised by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) Harlem Désir, Glyn Ford and Francis Wurtz, who asked the Commission to investigate the accusations brought forward by &quot;Révélation$&quot;, a book written by investigative journalist Denis Robert and former Clearstream member Ernest Backes, as well as to ensure that the 10 June 1990 directive (91/308 CE) on control of financial establishment be applied in all member states in an effective way. Commissioner Bolkestein replied that &quot;the Commission has no reason to date to believe that the Luxembourg authorities do not apply it vigorously&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;]. The three MEPs henceforth published a press statement asking the opening of an investigation by the European Union about the correct application of 10 June 1990 directive.

On 26 April 2006, French daily &quot;20 minutes&quot; revealed that &quot;in May 2005, MEP Paul van Buitenen was shocked by Frits Bolkestein&#x27;s presence in Bank Menatep&#x27;s international consultative council (owned by Russian magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky), a sulfurous Russian banking establishment, and by his work for Shell, British-Dutch petrol company. Two firms &#x27;detaining secret accounts in Clearstream&#x27; ... Van Buitenen, also Dutch, then asked for &#x27;clarification&#x27; to the European Commission and the opening of a parliamentary investigation. The Commission&#x27;s president, José Manuel Barroso, answered that these facts &quot;don&#x27;t bring up any new question&quot; and that it is not known &quot;if Menatep took contact with Bolkestein while he was in his functions&quot;. No investigation thereby took place.&quot; The free daily underlines that &quot;in 2001, it was Bolkestein himself that announced the Commission&#x27;s refusal to open up a parliamentary investigation on Clearstream&quot;, following MEP Harlem Désir&#x27;s requests and accusations that Menatep had an &quot;undeclared account&quot; at Clearstream. Bolkestein refused to answer any questions by the newspaper.

On 18 May 2010, Bolkestein advocated for the legalization of all drugs in an article called; &quot;Red het land, sta drugs toe&quot; which translates to; &quot;save the nation, allow drugs&quot; in the NRC Handelsblad, a Dutch newspaper. The article was endorsed by many professionals ranging from Els Borst, former Dutch minister of public health, to many jurists, professors and drug experts.

In &quot;Het Verval&quot; (&quot;The Decline&quot;), a book about Jews in the Netherlands written by Manfred Gerstenfeld, a Holocaust survivor and senior researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Bolkestein is quoted as having said that practicing Jews had no future in the Netherlands, due to antisemitism among Turkish and particularly Moroccan immigrants, and that they should emigrate to the United States or Israel. Bolkestein&#x27;s remarks, after having been published in a Dutch newspaper, raised a storm of criticism in December 2010. According to Ronny Naftaniel, head of the Jewish organisation CIDI, this was not the first time Bolkestein had expressed this view.

<text>Jackie DeShannon (born Sharon Lee Myers; August 21, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter and radio broadcaster who has had many hit song credits beginning in the 1960s, as both a singer and composer. She was one of the first female singer-songwriters of the rock and roll period. She is best known as the singer of &quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love&quot; and &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot;. She is the writer of &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot; and &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;, which became hits for The Searchers and Kim Carnes, respectively.

Since 2009, DeShannon has been an entertainment broadcast correspondent reporting Beatles band members&#x27; news for the radio program &quot;Breakfast with the Beatles&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Sharon Lee Myers was born in Hazel south of Murray, Kentucky, the daughter of parents who were farmers and musically inclined, James Erwin Myers and Sandra Jeanne LaMonte. By age six, Sharon was singing country tunes on a local radio show. By the age of 11, she was hosting her own radio program. After life on the farm became too difficult, the family moved from Murray, to the Fox River Valley in Illinois in the early 1950s, first to her mother&#x27;s hometown of Aurora, Illinois, where her father continued his career as a barber, and then (in 1952) to nearby Batavia, Illinois to the north, where Sherry Lee (as she called herself) attended high school.

In May 1955 while in 8th grade, Sharon Myers, then 13 years old, was featured in the local newspaper for her vocal talents and personal appearances at community gatherings, the local hospitals, and for assorted organizations. According to the &quot;Batavia Herald&quot;, she had her own Saturday morning radio show &quot;Breakfast Melodies&quot; on radio station WMRO in Aurora. Further: 
Though only 13, the youngster can boast almost 11 years of voice training and experience and in the past she has toured most of the south making personal appearances. Also she has sung on radio with a rhythm band for 2 years and has appeared on television 3 times.

In March 1956, &quot;Sherry Lee Myers&quot; made &quot;another guest appearance on Pee Wee King&#x27;s popular &quot;Country and Western Television Show&quot;&quot; on Saturday evening, March 3, on Channel 2—the CBS network affiliate in Chicago. The &quot;Batavia Herald&quot; wrote:Sherry Lee is a busy young lady. Each Saturday morning at 9:30 she is on the WMRO radio show. She had made appearances with the Pee Wee King Show at Ottawa, Rockford and LaSalle in recent weeks. Following her television appearance this Saturday night, the young Batavia artist will appear at the West Aurora Junior High School auditorium on Sunday, March 4th for three shows, 2, 4, and 8 pm.
She attended Batavia High School in Batavia for two years (1955–1957), leaving school after her second year.

==Early career==
She began to record under various names such as Sherry Lee, Jackie Dee, and Jackie Shannon with mixed success. &quot;Billboard&quot; noted (June 10, 1957) that Sherry Lee Myers, &quot;16-year-old C&amp;W singer of Batavia, Illinois,&quot; had recently signed to George Goldner&#x27;s Gone label in New York as a rockabilly artist, and that her &quot;handlers&quot; (Irving Schacht and Paul Kallett) had changed her name to Jackie Dee. Her only release on Gone included &quot;I&#x27;ll Be True&quot; (A) and &quot;How Wrong I Was&quot; (B), which appeared in both 78 rpm and 45 rpm versions. Myers almost certainly sang these songs at the Uptown Theater in Philadelphia on July 3, 1957, and at the Paramount Theater in New York, two weeks later, with Alan Freed&#x27;s Big Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Show. However, her interpretations of country songs &quot;Buddy&quot; (as Jackie Dee) and &quot;Trouble&quot; (as Jackie Shannon) gained the attention of rock and roll star Eddie Cochran, who arranged for her to travel to California to meet his girlfriend, singer-songwriter Sharon Sheeley, who formed a writing partnership with DeShannon in 1960. Their partnership produced Brenda Lee&#x27;s hits &quot;Dum Dum&quot; and &quot;Heart in Hand&quot;.

In 1960, DeShannon signed with Liberty Records, adopting the name Jackie DeShannon, believed to be the name of an Irish ancestor, after executives at Liberty thought the name Sharon Myers would not help sell records. In a &quot;Fresh Air&quot; interview (June 14, 2010), DeShannon said that she chose &quot;Jackie&quot; as a cross-gender name. Since she had a low singing voice, she could be heard as either male or female. When she found that &quot;Jackie Dee&quot; was too similar to Brenda Lee, Sandra Dee, et al., she changed it to Jackie Dee Shannon, which people heard as DeShannon. The name stuck.

Using her new name as a performer, she made the WLS Chicago radio survey with the single &quot;Lonely Girl&quot; in late 1960. A string of mostly flop singles followed, although &quot;The Prince&quot; bubbled under at No. 108 in the United States in early 1962, and &quot;Faded Love&quot; became her first US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 entry, squeaking in at No. 97 in February 1963. She fared better with the Sonny Bono-Jack Nitzsche song &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; and the self-penned &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot; later in 1963. Both reached the lower rungs of the US pop chart, but were Top 40 hits in Canada, where &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; made it all the way to No. 1. &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; and &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot; later became US and UK hits for The Searchers. A version of &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot; by Pam Tillis topped the country chart in 1994, and the song was also recorded by ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in 1998 and by ex-ABBA vocalist Agnetha Fältskog in 2004.

DeShannon recorded many other singles that encompassed teen pop, country ballads, rockabilly, gospel, and Ray Charles-style soul that did not fare as well on the charts. During these years it was her songwriting and public profile rather than her recording career that kept her contracted to Liberty. DeShannon dated Elvis Presley and formed friendships with The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. She also co-starred and sang with Bobby Vinton in the 1964 teen surf movie &quot;Surf Party&quot;.

DeShannon&#x27;s biggest break came in 1964 when she supported The Beatles on their first US tour, and formed a touring band with guitarist Ry Cooder. DeShannon co-wrote &quot;Breakaway&quot; with Sharon Sheeley, which was recorded by Irma Thomas in 1964, and by Tracey Ullman in 1983. She also wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Doubt Yourself Babe&quot; for &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, the 1965 debut album of The Byrds. Her music at this stage was heavily influenced by the American West Coast sounds and folk music. Staying briefly in England in 1965, DeShannon formed a songwriting partnership with Jimmy Page, which resulted in the songs &quot;Dream Boy&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Your Back on Me&quot;(covered, among others, by the British band Mike Sheridan&#x27;s Lot in 1965). DeShannon also wrote material for singer Marianne Faithfull, including her Top Ten UK and US hit &quot;Come and Stay With Me&quot;, which became Faithfull&#x27;s biggest UK hit, peaking at No. 4 in 1965. In the same year, Cher recorded the song on her solo debut album &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot;. Three years later Jackie DeShannon recorded the song for herself, on her &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot; album in 1968. She also appeared on the television show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;

==Hit love songs==
Moving to New York City, DeShannon co-wrote with Randy Newman, producing such songs as &quot;She Don&#x27;t Understand Him Like I Do&quot; and &quot;Did He Call Today Mama?&quot;, as well as writing &quot;You Have No Choice&quot; for Delaney Bramlett. In March 1965, DeShannon recorded Burt Bacharach and Hal David&#x27;s &quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love&quot;, which led to club tours and regular appearances on television and went to No. 7 on the US chart and No. 1 in Canada. (DeShannon&#x27;s recording of the song was later used in the 1969 film &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;). She appeared in the 1967 film &quot;C&#x27;mon, Let&#x27;s Live a Little&quot;, with Bobby Vee, as a folk singer.

In 1969, she scored her next smash single and album, both entitled &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot;. The self-penned single (co-written with her brother, Randy Myers and Jimmy Holiday) sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot; was performed as the closing number at the Music for UNICEF Concert, broadcast worldwide from the United Nations General Assembly in 1979, and was covered in 1988 as a duet by Annie Lennox and Al Green (reaching No. 9 in the Billboard Hot 100), and by Dolly Parton in 1993. The single &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot; from the same album was also a moderate hit.

==Later career==
Switching to Atlantic Records in 1970 and moving to Los Angeles, DeShannon recorded the critically acclaimed albums &quot;Jackie&quot; (1972) and &quot;Your Baby Is a Lady&quot; (1974), but they failed to produce the same commercial success as her previous releases. In 1973, she was invited by Van Morrison to sing on his album &quot;Hard Nose the Highway&quot; (singing backup on both the title track and &quot;Warm Love&quot;).
In 1974, DeShannon released &quot;New Arrangement&quot; for Columbia Records. She co-wrote four songs on the album with Donna Weiss, including &quot;Queen of the Rodeo&quot; and &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot;. The latter became a worldwide No. 1 single for Kim Carnes in 1981, earning Weiss and DeShannon the 1982 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. DeShannon released &quot;You&#x27;re the Only Dancer&quot; in 1977 and a single from that album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let The Flame Burn Out&quot;, was a minor hit, reaching No. 65 in the Billboard Hot 100.

DeShannon continued to record. She released &quot;You Know Me&quot;, an album of original songs, for Varèse Sarabande in 2000, and &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot;, a new recording of her best-known songs, in 2011. She was portrayed by singer Liz Phair in an episode of &quot;American Dreams&quot;. On June 17, 2010, DeShannon was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In 2012 she wrote and recorded &quot;For Africa, In Africa&quot;, a song inspired by the urgent need for action to provide clean water for the African Continent. Using her continuing access and friendship with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, DeShannon has appeared as a contributing entertainment broadcast correspondent reporting historical anecdotes and current touring and personal news and publicity pertaining to the two surviving Beatles for &quot;Breakfast with the Beatles&quot; on Sirius XM Satellite Radio on the weekends since October 2009.

==Personal life==
She had a brother, Randy James Myers (1947–2021) and sometimes wrote songs with him. In the mid-1960s, she was a companion of Jimmy Page and dated Love guitarist Bryan MacLean. It is likely that Page wrote the song &quot;Tangerine&quot; (which appeared on the third Led Zeppelin album) after the breakup of his relationship with DeShannon in early 1965.

Her first husband was Liberty Records executive Irving V. &quot;Bud&quot; Dain, whom she married on January 29, 1966 (it was annulled in 1967). DeShannon has been married to singer-songwriter and film composer Randy Edelman since 1976. They have a son, Noah, who was born in 1978.

<text>George Allen &amp; Unwin was a British publishing company formed in 1911 when Sir Stanley Unwin purchased a controlling interest in George Allen &amp; Co. It became one of the leading publishers of the twentieth century and established an Australian subsidiary in 1976. In 1990 Allen &amp; Unwin was sold to HarperCollins, and the Australian branch was the subject of a management buy-out.

==George Allen &amp; Unwin in the UK==
George Allen &amp; Sons was established in 1871 by George Allen, with the backing of John Ruskin, becoming George Allen &amp; Co. Ltd. in 1911 when it merged with Swan Sonnenschein and then George Allen &amp; Unwin on 4 August 1914 as a result of Stanley Unwin&#x27;s purchase of a controlling interest. Frank Arthur Mumby and Frances Helena Swan Stallybrass, Unwin&#x27;s son Rayner S. Unwin and his nephew Philip helped him to run the company, which published works by Bertrand Russell, Arthur Waley, Roald Dahl, Lancelot Hogben and Thor Heyerdahl. It became well known as J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s publisher some time after publishing the popular children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 1937, and its high fantasy sequel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; novel in 1954–1955. Book series published by the firm in this period include the Muirhead Library of Philosophy and Unwin Books, a paperback imprint.

Rayner Unwin retired at the end of 1985, and the firm was amalgamated in 1986 with Bell &amp; Hyman to form Unwin Hyman Ltd., with Robin Hyman as chief executive. From this time &quot;Allen &amp; Unwin&quot; continued only as the name of the Australian subsidiary of Unwin Hyman. Rayner Unwin returned for a while as part-time chairman of Unwin Hyman, retiring again at the end of 1988. It was over the objections of Rayner Unwin, the largest shareholder, that in 1990 Hyman sold the firm to HarperCollins. HarperCollins has since sold Unwin Hyman&#x27;s academic book list to Routledge.

==Allen &amp; Unwin in Australia==
Allen &amp; Unwin Australia Pty Ltd became independent in July 1990 by means of a management buy-out after the UK firm was bought by HarperCollins. Now known simply as &quot;Allen &amp; Unwin&quot;, the company went on to become the most successful &quot;independent&quot; publisher in Australia. It currently publishes up to 250 new titles a year. Among the many authors published by Allen &amp; Unwin are Alex Miller, Christos Tsiolkas, Garth Nix, Jodi Picoult, Kate Morton, Michael Connelly, Thomas Keneally, Peter Corris, Paul Keating, Stephanie Dowrick, and Christopher Hitchens. Allen &amp; Unwin is also co-sponsor and publisher of the annual Australian/Vogel Literary Award.

In 2017, Allen &amp; Unwin refused to publish the book &quot;Silent Invasion&quot; due to legal concerns that it &quot;would be targeted by Beijing and its proxies in Australia.&quot;

<text>Arnprior is a town in Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada.

Arnprior has experienced significant growth in populations with the widening of the Ontario Highway 417 to four lanes. The town experienced an increase in population by 8.4% from 2011 to 2016, at which time its population was 8,795. It was also during these critical 5 years that the Town of Arnprior surpassed the neighboring Town of Renfrew, Ontario, to become the county&#x27;s third-largest town or city by population, behind Petawawa and Pembroke. The town is a namesake of Arnprior, Scotland, and is known for its lumber, hydro power generation, aerospace, farming, and proximity to the National Capital Region.

==History==
The land occupied by what is now called Arnprior is part of the traditional territory of the Algonquin nation of indigenous North Americans. The first European explorers, led by Samuel de Champlain, first visited the area in May 1613.

In 1823, a surveyed block was ceded to Archibald McNab and named McNab Township. McNab had approval from the Family Compact to treat the settlers on his land in the feudal manner practised in Scotland. In 1831 the town was named by the Buchanan Brothers after McNab&#x27;s ancestral home of Arnprior, Scotland.

Tired of the harsh treatment, the settlers revolted and, after a government investigation, McNab was forced to vacate the area in 1841. Arnprior and Braeside and McNab township grew as separate communities and boomed when they became integrated into eastern Ontario&#x27;s massive timber industry.

One of the most successful businessmen of the upper Ottawa was Daniel McLachlin, who built a massive sawmill at the confluence of the Madawaska and Ottawa rivers, and expanded the community of Arnprior. The lumber industry maintained a significant position until the closing of the Gillies Mill. One of the most enduring structures of the day was a grist mill built by the Buchanans on the west bank of the Madawaska River.

By 1869, Arnprior was an incorporated village with a population of 2,000 in the Township of McNab. It was on the Brockville and Ottawa Railway at the junction of the Madawaska and Ottawa rivers. The average price of land was $20 to $40.

The grey stone building served many purposes after it stopped being used as a grist mill, finally being operated as a restaurant and a gas station, first by the Beattie and then the Baird families, ending in 1974. The facility was bought by Ontario Hydro prior to the restructuring on the bridge and the creation of a new weir to control the river. The building was consumed by fire in 1976. The forests of the period are represented in the Grove which is an example of indigenous forest, grown after a fire in the 18th century. With individual specimens reaching , these are the tallest white pines in Ontario.
Arnprior was incorporated as a village in 1862. Thirty years later (in 1892), it was incorporated as a town.

On June 8, 1944, a , , was recommissioned as HMCS &quot;Arnprior&quot; until 1946.

Arnprior became a recognized name in the numismatic trade. This has a special link to a local employer. In 1955 Playtex ordered some silver dollars for their employees. These coins were later found to show only two and one-half water lines instead of four to the right of the canoe. This variety becomes known as the Arnprior dollar.

The history of Arnprior is preserved and documented at the Arnprior and District Museum (located in the former post office building and library) and the Arnprior and McNab/Braeside Archives, located next door in the basement of the public library. The sandstone building is the defining element in local architecture.

==Economy==

Arnprior has drawn new business to Eastern Ontario. Proximity to the city of Ottawa, easy access to highway 417, access to a local airport, full services and infrastructure have contributed to making Arnprior the location for multinational corporations including Arnprior Aerospace Inc, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc, Nylene Canada Inc, Pacific Safety Products, Pillar 5 Pharma, Sandvik Materials Technology Canada, and a host of other innovative businesses.

The Arnprior and Area Chamber of Commerce has over 100 members and is a support and advocate for many of the corporations and small to medium-sized businesses within the Arnprior area.

Some of the major corporations and top employers:
*Plaintree Systems Inc.
*Nu-tech Precision Metals
*Pillar 5
*BWX Technologies, Inc.

The lumber trade continued in the form of the Gillies sawmill in nearby McNab Township until its closing in 1993. Pictures of the early days of the lumbering industry are seen at the online Charles Macnamara Retrospective.

Kenwood Mills, initially a blanket manufacturer which developed woven fabrics for the pulp and paper industry, was a significant employer in Arnprior and was bought in 1918 by Huyck Corporation. It was a strong contributor to Arnprior remaining viable during the Depression. The building has now been renovated into the Kenwood Corporate Centre which houses a number of offices, warehouse spaces, conference rooms, a café and a gym.

Sullivan and Sons and Smith Construction companies were significant economic drivers and employers based in Arnprior. In 2014 they celebrated their 100th year in business and continue to be a major employer in the town and a large community supporter.
After the Second World War, companies such as Playtex, Pfizer and Boeing came to Arnprior. Boeing Aircraft Company began manufacturing in 1955 and maintained an operation until selling to Arnprior Aerospace in October 2005.

The Madawaska River at McEwen&#x27;s Creek was dammed to create a hydro generating station with approval given in 1972. The dam, which became operational in 1976, has created a new body of water known as Lake Madawaska. This was the fifth and last dam to be built on the Madawaska River, and they have a total generating capacity of 614 MW.

=== Lineage Chart ===








==Perpetuations==
The 48th Highlanders of Canada perpetuate the 15th Battalion (48th Highlanders of Canada), CEF, the 92nd Battalion (48th Highlanders), CEF, and the 134th Battalion (48th Highlanders), CEF.

==Operational history==

=== South African War ===
The 48 Highlanders contributed individual volunteers for the Canadian contingents to South Africa, mainly the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry.

=== The First World War ===
During World War I, the 15th Battalion, CEF, was authorized on 1 September 1914 and embarked for Britain on 26 September 1914 and arrived in France on 15 February 1915. The battalion fought as part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division in France and Flanders throughout the war. The 15th Battalion was disbanded on 30 August 1920.

The 92nd Battalion (48th Highlanders), CEF was authorized on 30 July 1915 and embarked for Britain on 20 May 1916, where the battalion provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 24 January 1917, when its personnel were absorbed by the 5th Reserve Battalion, CEF before being disbanded on 1 September 1917.

The 134th Battalion was authorized on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Britain on 8 August 1916, where it provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 7 March 1918, when its personnel were absorbed by the 12th Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion was then disbanded on 29 November 1918.

=== The Second World War ===
During World War II, the regiment mobilized the 48th Highlanders of Canada, CASF, on 1 September 1939. It was subsequently redesignated the 1st Battalion, 48th Highlanders of Canada, CASF, on 7 November 1940. It departed Canada for Britain on 16 December 1939, and on 13 June 1940, it went to France as part of the abortive Second British Expeditionary Force. The battalion reached Sablé-sur-Sarthe before being ordered back to Britain. It landed in Sicily on 10 July 1943 and in Italy on 3 September 1943 as part of the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Infantry Division. In March 1945, the regiment moved with the remainder of the I Canadian Corps to North-West Europe, where it fought until the end of the war. The overseas battalion was disbanded on 31 December 1945.

On 1 June 1945, a second battalion of the regiment was mobilized for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, designated as the 3rd Canadian Infantry Battalion (48th Highlanders of Canada), CASF. This battalion was disbanded on 1 November 1945.

== History ==
Since its formation in 1891, the 48th Highlanders have had a longstanding tradition of participation in the life of its parent city, Toronto. The regiment has participated in community functions for over 100 years, in addition to fulfilling its operational duties around the world. Since its inception, the men and women of the regiment have been among the first Canadians to step forward and answer their nation&#x27;s call. Members of the regiment have served on Operation Recuperation, in the Golan Heights, Korea, South Africa, Cambodia, Cyprus, Bosnia, and Afghanistan to name only a few and of course, both world wars and the Second Boer War.

The regiment is allied with the British Army&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Scotland, formerly the Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons) (formerly the Gordon Highlanders). The relationship with the Gordon Highlanders represents the oldest officially sanctioned regimental alliance in the Commonwealth, and small unit exchanges are conducted frequently.

A memorial was erected in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto sometime after 1912 in honour of two soldiers killed returning from a training exercise in 1912 and as a monument to the 48th Highlanders of Canada&#x27;s veterans and war dead of the South African War.

The regiment provided a guard of honour for the G7 summit in 1988, a full royal guard of honour for Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 as well as the Royal Winter Fair, annually. The Regimental Colour Party has marched in events as far afield as Prince Edward Island and the United States and remains in great demand as a living example of the pageantry and gallantry of the Highland regimental tradition.

The regiment&#x27;s motto is , which is Gaelic for &quot;faithful forever&quot;. The regimental tartan is the Davidson, but pipers wear the Stewart of Fingask. The regiment&#x27;s colonel-in-chief was Queen Elizabeth II until 8 September 2022, with her death.

=== Second World War ===
=== War in Afghanistan ===
== 48th Highlanders of Canada Pipes &amp; Drums ==

The regiment&#x27;s Military Band and the Pipes and Drums have played at every Toronto Maple Leafs home opening game at both Maple Leaf Gardens and the Air Canada Centre. The bands were requested by Conn Smythe, who had been a major in the First World War, to play at the opening of the new Maple Leaf Gardens on 12 November 1931.

== &quot;The Glamour Boys&quot; &amp; &quot;The Dirty Four Dozen&quot; ==
The regiment is nicknamed &quot;The Glamour Boys&quot; or &quot;The Dirty Four Dozen&quot;.

The name &quot;The Glamour Boys&quot; was coined by the other regiments that served with the 48th Highlanders during World War II in the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. The brigade was being inspected by King George VI but there were not enough regulation khaki puttees (leg wrappings) for all the soldiers. The 48th had to wear unofficial blue puttees. The King inquired as to why the 48th wore different puttees from the rest of the brigade. He was told that there were not enough khaki ones for all the units. The King replied that he liked the blue puttees better and that they should keep them. The 48th Highlanders continued to wear blue puttees until battledress was eventually phased out.

The nickname &quot;Dirty Four Dozen&quot; is a play on &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; and &quot;48&quot; being equivalent to four dozen.

== Cadets ==
The regiment supports two cadet corps. These are the 48th Highlanders Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps, which is based in the same armoury as the regiment itself, and 142 St. Andrew&#x27;s College Highland Cadet Corps, based in Aurora as one of the mandatory activities for students of St. Andrew&#x27;s College.

== 48th Highlanders Museum ==

The 48th Highlanders Museum is in downtown Toronto in the basement of St. Andrew&#x27;s Church at the corner of King and Simcoe. The mission of the Museum is to collect, preserve, research and photograph material relating to the history of the 48th Highlanders of Canada, its former members and its site, and, through the appropriate display of such items, to convey this history to the currently serving members, the broader Canadian Forces community and the public. The museum includes regimental uniforms, medals, photographs, weapons and other artifacts. Founded in 1959, the museum opened in its current location in 1997. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, OMMC and Virtual Museum of Canada.

<text>Sapphire &amp; Steel is a British television supernatural sci-fi/fantasy series starring Joanna Lumley as Sapphire and David McCallum as Steel. Produced by ATV, it ran from 1979 to 1982 on the ITV network. The series was created by Peter J. Hammond who conceived the programme under the working title &quot;The Time Menders&quot;, after a stay in an allegedly haunted castle. Hammond also wrote all the stories except for the fifth, which was co-written by Don Houghton and Anthony Read.

From 2005 to 2008, &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; returned in a series of audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, starring Susannah Harker and David Warner as the main characters.

==Series overview==
=== Premise ===
The opening credits include the narration that &quot;All irregularities will be handled by the forces controlling each dimension. Transuranic heavy elements may not be used where there is life. Medium atomic weights are available: Gold, Lead, Copper, Jet, Diamond, Radium, Sapphire, Silver and Steel. Sapphire and Steel have been assigned.&quot; In the sixth and final assignment, Lead was replaced with Mercury in the opening credits.

The programme centres on a pair of interdimensional operatives, the eponymous Sapphire and Steel. Very little is revealed about their purposes or backgrounds in the course of the series but they appear to be engaged in guarding the continuing flow of time. They are two of a number of elements that assume human form and are sent to investigate strange events; others include Lead (Val Pringle), who takes the aspect of a jovial, friendly giant, and Silver (David Collings), a technician who can melt metals in his hands.

In the series, it is explained that Time is like a progressing corridor that surrounds everything, but there are weak spots where Time – implied to be a malignant force – can break into the present and take things. There are also creatures from the beginnings and ends of time that roam the corridor looking for the same weak spots to break through.

These breaks are most often triggered by the presence of something old in a modern situation, for example a traditional nursery rhyme, an old photograph, or a house decorated with antiques. Holding onto something of the past opposes progress and allows &#x27;Time&#x27; to break into the present – the more old things present, the easier it is for this to occur (such as is seen in episode 1 where the two-century-old house is full of clocks and other antiques in which a traditional nursery rhyme has been read hundreds of times as a bedtime story). When this breaking-in of &#x27;Time&#x27; occurs, Investigators will be sent to assess the situation and then, if intervention is warranted, Operators are assigned to deal with the problem by a mysterious unseen authority, to be assisted by Specialists if necessary.

Each adventure usually starts with Sapphire and Steel simply showing up, seemingly out of nowhere, although sometimes they are already present when the story begins. They will then investigate and mingle with various humans, although it is nearly always the location the humans are in which is of the most interest: an old house which dates back to the 18th century, an abandoned railway station, a modern-day motorway petrol station, and so on. The stories are generally quite cryptic, raising more questions than answers, and have an eerie air to them, being as much ghost stories as they are science fiction. The ambiguous nature of the programme extends to its main characters. While Sapphire is portrayed as more affable and &quot;human&quot; than the no-nonsense, grim Steel, it is clear that their prime concern is to deal with the break in Time, sometimes over the safety of the humans caught in the incidents they investigate. The general tone of the series is however forward-looking; that old things are dangerous, and that the past should be left behind or an evil force will be able to enter through those old things. In this situation, progress and newness are portrayed as the protecting force against &#x27;Time&#x27;.

===Characters===
It is heavily implied that Sapphire and Steel are not human, given their abilities and manner. Steel, for example, often has gaps in his knowledge of human culture and even Sapphire&#x27;s grace is tempered with a cool detachment from the humans they interact with. In Adventure 5, Steel confirms that they were alien, &quot;in the extraterrestrial sense.&quot; The two also refer to being involved in the mystery of the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, and in one case state they will be waiting for a ship to surface in seventy-five years. This could mean they are either exceptionally long-lived or some kind of time travel is involved. P. J. Hammond confirmed the former hypothesis in a 1993 interview.

Sapphire and Steel, who are Operators, are occasionally assisted by other beings, including Lead and Silver. Silver is stated in Adventure 6 to be a Specialist rather than an Operator. There are 127 operatives in total, including 12 transuranic elements, which cannot be assigned where life exists. Although they are described as elements, many of the code names are non-elements, such as Sapphire, Steel, and Jet, although these could be pseudonyms for aesthetics or discretion. Sapphire also has a flirtatious relationship with Silver, contributing to an air of underlying sexual tension on the occasions that Silver is called upon to assist the duo. The relationship between Steel and Sapphire similarly exhibits occasional tension, as evidenced in Adventure 2 when Steel admits feeling love for Sapphire and, at one point, even kissing her on the cheek. In Adventure 1, Lead mentioned that Jet sent Steel her love and that Silver was having relationship troubles with Copper &quot;again&quot;.

Among Sapphire&#x27;s abilities is the power to manipulate time in small ways as well as determine the age or historical details of an object by touching it (psychometry). This latter ability is referred to in Adventure 2 as &quot;spot analysis&quot;. Her most prominent ability is to &quot;take back time,&quot; literally rewinding it in a localised area to see or replay the past. She states in Adventure 1 that she cannot take time back twenty-four hours; in the last episode of the same adventure, at Steel&#x27;s request she takes time back &quot;half a day&quot;. In Adventure 2, she is able to &quot;hold time for a day&quot;, when another (in this case, the creature seen as the darkness) takes time back over multiple days. Whether this is an improvement in abilities or a different skill entirely is not made clear. She also exhibits an ability to obtain information about people – their ages and backgrounds as well as psychological insights into their personality – just by being close to them. Sometimes it appears that she does not discover this information herself but is receiving the information telepathically from some external source. In Adventure 2, it is stated that the age at which a living person will die is not estimated but recorded, that it is an historical fact. Nothing else is revealed in the television series as to the extent or nature of any such records, or to what extent Sapphire uses them in relation to information obtained directly. She can also manipulate people&#x27;s emotions, and project illusions. When she uses her powers, her irises will usually glow blue or, under some circumstances, turquoise.

Steel, on the other hand, can freeze himself to absolute zero which gives him the ability to destroy &#x27;ghosts&#x27;, which are in actuality remnants of Time. He apparently possesses immense strength (in Adventure 3 he ties knots in lift cables to prevent the lift from being used) and a degree of invulnerability. He also exhibits telekinetic abilities, being able to paralyse people with a look, weld metal with his bare hands or undo deadbolts with a gesture.

Both Sapphire and Steel (as well as all Operatives) also appear to be able to teleport a great distance.

The operatives can also communicate telepathically with each other, and in Adventure 5, Sapphire grants this ability to a human being, whom she dubs &quot;Brass&quot; for the duration. Sapphire removes this ability at the end of the story. It is also suggested in Adventure 5 that other powers can be granted. It is hinted, in the debate that ensues between Sapphire and Steel after Sapphire gives Brass his abilities, that different powers are classed at different levels, with telepathy being considered one of the most basic.

It is not made clear in the series as to what boundaries exist on the skills of operatives. In Adventure 2, Steel cannot perform &quot;spot analysis&quot;, as it is not his field, but in Adventure 4, Sapphire and Steel together are specifically able to replicate Silver&#x27;s ability to transmutate by remembering what he did.

Other operatives that appear also have special powers. Silver (played by David Collings), a Specialist who is designated as a Technician, is good with electronics and gadgets, is able to transform one small object into another, and is even able to replicate small objects out of nothing. He can also create long-lasting visual images of objects too large to replicate, although the exact parameters for such images are never revealed. Lead (played by Val Pringle), on the other hand, possesses superhuman strength and can act as needed insulation for Steel when he freezes himself to extreme temperatures.

==Production and transmission==
The programme ran for four years and 34 episodes, each lasting about 25 minutes and generally included a of the preceding episode. The first and second stories were shown in the summer of 1979, the second story&#x27;s transmission interrupted by industrial action at the ITV network which led to a repeat of the story in 1979. The third and fourth stories were transmitted in January 1981, and the fifth in August 1981 with a sixth story &quot;in the can&quot; for future transmission. The audience figures were unusually high for a science fantasy series with the first episode, gaining 11.8 million viewers and finishing as the fourth most watched programme of the week across all channels. This continued with a further seven episodes of the first year appearing in the top 20. Three more episodes in 1981 and one in 1982 also entered the top 20 ratings.

By this time, production costs were increasing. The programme had been allocated a minuscule production budget, which led to the use of simple staging and minimal special effects, ultimately contributing to the uneasy atmosphere of the show. The high profile and limited availability of the principal actors, Lumley and McCallum, meant that shooting was somewhat sporadic, and the programme&#x27;s producers ATV were in the process of being reorganised into the new Central Independent Television; all factors which led to the series&#x27; demise. Central felt that viewers might mistake the new programmes for repeats of old ones, and broadcast the final, four-part story in late August 1982 to very little fanfare. Despite this, the first episode gained a high rating and finished in the top 20 most-watched programmes of the week. The show has never been repeated on UK terrestrial television, but some episodes were shown on the satellite and cable station Bravo in the mid-1990s. The program is available free online at ShoutFactoryTV.com and Freevee, and with a subscription at Prime Video or ITVX. 

The UK digital channel Forces TV acquired the series, showing two episodes each weekday evening from 1 June 2020. The complete series was added to BritBox in August, 2020 and is currently also available to stream free in the UK on ITVX Player. The UK digital channel Rewind TV began showing the series, again two episodes each day from October 2024.

==Television stories==
: &quot;For more information see List of Sapphire &amp; Steel serials&quot;
None of the stories had on-screen titles, or any official titles assigned by the writers. The Region 1 Complete Series DVD release gives the titles &quot;Escape Through a Crack in Time&quot;, &quot;The Railway Station&quot;, &quot;The Creature&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;The Man Without a Face&quot;, &quot;Dr. McDee Must Die&quot; and &quot;The Trap&quot;, respectively. These titles have often been cited as having been created by science fiction magazine &quot;Time Screen&quot;. Further reading reveals that in the booklet for the series, written by Tim Worthington, and included with the most recent DVD box set, on page 7 there is this quote regarding titles from creator P. J. Hammond &quot;I never gave titles to the stories. Neither did the production department. I think certain fanbases may have made up their own titles in order to discuss and analyse various stories.&quot; The various British home video releases title the stories as &quot;Adventure&quot; or &quot;Assignment&quot; I through VI.

The booklet also says, on the same page, &quot;some sources have claimed that these were taken from the original scripts, whereas others dismiss them as an invention on the part of a science fiction fanzine, although the editor of the fanzine in question denies that they were ever used within its pages&quot; and furthermore that &quot;the show&#x27;s distributors have never knowingly used them.&quot;

The final television story ends on a cliffhanger. Apparently resentful of Sapphire and Steel&#x27;s independence, a higher authority sends entities known as Transient Beings (similar to the operatives but until now trapped in the past), to set a trap for them in a motorway café. The serial concludes with Silver dispatched to an unknown fate – and Sapphire and Steel being trapped in the café, floating through space, apparently for eternity. The cliffhanger has never been resolved, although Hammond has stated that vague plans existed for further adventures. This was also stated by Joanna Lumley in her autobiography, who remembered that they were told that this was merely an end-of-series cliffhanger, and that Sapphire and Steel would be freed at the start of the next series. However, in an interview with &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; (#329, cover date: 30 April 2003), David Collings recalled that although another series was planned, Joanna Lumley and David McCallum both decided that they had had enough and did not wish to do any more.

==Merchandise==

One novelisation of the series was released. The first story of the series was released by Star Books in 1979 and was written by Peter J. Hammond.

A two-page coloured &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; picture strip, written by Angus Allan and drawn by Arthur Ranson, appeared in the &quot;Look-In&quot; magazine. It ran for a total of 76 issues from 1979-1981 – with a break of 13 issues between runs – and formed 14 untitled stories. It would appear that Ranson used photographs of Joanna Lumley and David McCallum from the first television adventure for reference, as Sapphire and Steel are almost always depicted wearing the outfits from this story. In the third story, Lead makes a cameo appearance and displays a further power: turning British soldiers from the Napoleonic War into miniature (and presumably lead) toy soldiers. However, the picture strip version of Lead – though depicted as a powerfully built black man – was not based upon Val Pringle who played the part on television; it can only be assumed that Ranson had very little in the way of photographic reference material in this case. In addition, a one-off &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; text story titled &quot;The Albatross&quot; was published in the 1981 &quot;Look-In Annual&quot;. This was illustrated in black-and-white by Arthur Ranson.

Only one &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; Annual was published, in late 1980, by World International Publishing Ltd, and featured a number of text stories and features. The front cover used the same photograph as that on P.J. Hammond&#x27;s 1979 Star Books novelisation of Adventure One.

P.J. Hammond did not write the stories for &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel Annual 1981&quot;, but he was sent proofs to read in advance of publication. His only reservations with the stories were that Sapphire and Steel were able to move back in time, which he felt tended to contradict the premise set in the television series that Time was only allowed to break into the present day. However, this did not worry Hammond too much as, like &quot;Look-In&quot;, the Annual was aimed at younger readers.

==Home media==
The series was released twice on home video during the 1990s, with each serial available separately as a single or double-cassette set. Stories were labelled &quot;Adventure&quot; in the first releases (in lieu of story titles) and &quot;Assignment&quot; for the second release.

In 2002, the series was released for the first time on DVD, in the UK. Originally, it was released as two box-sets, with the first three stories on one (20 episodes) and the final three on the other (14 episodes). Also in the UK, Network Distributing Ltd Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD on 5 November 2007. The six-disc set features a new documentary and commentaries. On 26 May 2008, the complete series box-set was re-released with new packaging.

In the US, A&amp;E Home Entertainment, under license from Carlton International Media Limited, released the entire series on Region 1 DVD on 28 December 2004 and Shout! Factory re-released The complete series on 27 August 2013.

==Audio plays==
: &quot;For more information see List of Sapphire &amp; Steel serials&quot;
In late May 2004, Big Finish Productions announced that it had secured the rights to produce a new series of &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; audio adventures for release on CD. However, neither McCallum nor Lumley reprised their roles: McCallum was working in the United States and Lumley declined to play Sapphire again. The characters were recast, with Susannah Harker and David Warner taking over the roles. The range is produced by Nigel Fairs and Jason Haigh-Ellery.

The character of Gold (played by Mark Gatiss) appears in the first adventure &quot;The Passenger&quot; and returns in &quot;Perfect Day&quot; and &quot;Zero&quot;. He is portrayed as impatient and inexperienced when dealing with both humans and the various manifestations of Time, even more detached and clinical in many ways than Steel, almost as if he is still in training. The character of Ruby (played by Lisa Bowerman) appears in the second series story &quot;Water Like a Stone&quot;, reappearing in &quot;Cruel Immortality&quot; and &quot;Second Sight&quot;. Her character has an understanding and affinity to Time within the rhythms of music, and also comes across as rather dry and sardonic, especially when interacting with Steel. David Collings reprises his role as Silver in the third and fifth stories of the first series of audio plays and then again in the third story of the third series. During the production of each series, Nigel Fairs has had to step in at late notice to write a replacement script (writing &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; from John Ainsworth&#x27;s outline in series one, replacing Gary Russell&#x27;s &quot;Big Fun&quot; with &quot;Cruel Immortality&quot; in series two and replacing Joseph Lidster&#x27;s &quot;Reborn&quot; with &quot;Second Sight&quot; in series three).

It was originally said by Big Finish that the new stories would be set before the climactic final story of the television series, but the released plays are actually set after assignment 6, and at the start of &quot;The Passenger&quot;, the characters comment that it has been a long time since they last worked together and, in &quot;Cruel Immortality&quot;, imply that they were freed in some unspecified way by Silver.

At the end of &quot;The Mystery of the Missing Hour&quot;, Sapphire and Steel once again find themselves trapped. The following story, &quot;Second Sight&quot; sees the characters &#x27;reborn&#x27; once more - this time in the guise of two young Australians, played by Blair McDonough and Anna Skellern. At the end of &quot;Second Sight&quot;, however, Ruby was able to release the previous incarnations of Sapphire and Steel from their trap - with David Warner and Susannah Harker reprising their roles for the rest of the series.

The audio dramas featured some notable guest stars - including Hugo Myatt, Muriel Pavlow, Daphne Oxenford, Lucy Gaskell, Colin Baker, Sarah Douglas, Sam Kelly, David Horovitch, Mark Gatiss and Louise Jameson.

==Planned remakes==
The idea of a remake of &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; was floated a few times, but the plans never came to fruition. Original series creator, Peter J. Hammond, said that he had discussions with ITV about a remake in 2006, but no developments followed. According to reports, &quot;the backlash to the US remake of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; [...] put an end to the idea&quot;. In July 2015, &quot;Luther&quot; creator Neil Cross announced to &quot;Variety&quot; that he was working on a new series of &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot;. The following year, ITV Studios-owned independent Big Talk Productions confirmed that it was remaking &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot;, with Cross attached to the project, and writer Ed Hime indicating that he was part of the team. However, in a December 2017 interview with &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, Cross said that the project had been cancelled, mainly due to the limited popularity of the original show.

<text>The 49th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 49° north of Earth&#x27;s equator. It crosses Europe, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.

The city of Paris is about south of the 49th parallel and is the largest city between the 48th and 49th parallels. Its main airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport, lies on the parallel.

Roughly of the Canada–United States border was designated to follow the 49th parallel from British Columbia to Manitoba on the Canada side, and from Washington to Minnesota on the U.S. side, more specifically from the Strait of Georgia to the Lake of the Woods. This international border was specified in the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 and the Oregon Treaty of 1846, though survey markers placed in the 19th century cause the border to deviate from the 49th parallel by up to .

From a point on the ground at this latitude, the sun is above the horizon for 16 hours, 12 minutes during the summer solstice and 8 hours, 14 minutes during the winter solstice.

This latitude also roughly corresponds to the minimum latitude in which astronomical twilight can last all night near the summer solstice. All-night astronomical twilight lasts from about June 9th to July 2nd. At midnight on the summer solstice, the altitude of the sun is about −17.56°.

Slightly less than one-eighth of the Earth&#x27;s surface is north of the 49th parallel.

== Monuments on the parallel ==

*In North America, the westernmost monument on the 49th parallel is the Point Roberts Boundary Monument near the corner of Marine Drive and Roosevelt Way in the Point Roberts, Washington exclave south of Delta, British Columbia.
*The Peace Arch is a large monument between Surrey, British Columbia, and Blaine, Washington. It is the centerpiece of Peace Arch Park.
*Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park in Alberta and Montana
*The International Peace Garden is located at the border between Manitoba and North Dakota, about midway between the nearby communities of Boissevain, Manitoba and Dunseith, North Dakota. Until its demolition in 2017, the Peace Tower stood at the focal point of the garden, on the border. As of 2018, a new tower is slated to be constructed on the spot.
*The Stadtgarten in Karlsruhe, Germany, marks the 49th parallel with a stone and painted line.

=== History ===

In 1714, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company proposed the 49th parallel as the western portion of the boundary between the company&#x27;s land and French territory. At the time, Britain and France had agreed, in the Peace of Utrecht, to negotiate a boundary, but negotiations ultimately failed.

Following the Louisiana Purchase by the United States in 1803, it was generally agreed that the boundary between the new territory and British North America was along the watershed between the Missouri River and Mississippi River basins on one side and the Hudson Bay basin on the other. However, it is often difficult to precisely determine the location of a watershed in a region of level plains, such as in central North America. The British and American committees that met after the War of 1812 to resolve boundary disputes recognized there would be much animosity in surveying the watershed boundary, and agreed on a simpler border solution in the Treaty of 1818: the 49th parallel. Both sides gained and lost some territory by this convention, but the United States gained more than it lost, in particular securing title to the Red River Basin. This treaty established the boundary only between the line of longitude of the northwesternmost point of Lake of the Woods, on the east, and the Rocky Mountains, on the west. West of the Rockies, the treaty established joint occupation of the Oregon Country by both parties; east of Lake of the Woods, the boundary established in the Treaty of Paris would be retained.

Although the Convention of 1818 settled the boundary, neither country was immediately able to take control over the territories on its side of the line; effective control still rested with local First Nations peoples, mainly the Métis, Assiniboine, Lakota, and Blackfoot. Their power was gradually ceded by conquest and treaty during the several decades that followed. Among these peoples, the 49th parallel was nicknamed the Medicine Line because of its seemingly magical ability to prevent U.S. soldiers from crossing it.

In the 1844 U.S. presidential election, the Democratic Party asserted that the northern border of the Oregon Territory should be 54°40′, later reflected in the 1846 slogan &quot;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!&quot; However, the Oregon boundary dispute was settled diplomatically in the 1846 Oregon Treaty. This agreement divided the Oregon Country between British North America and the United States by extending the 49th parallel boundary to the west coast, ending in the Strait of Georgia; it then circumvents Vancouver Island through Boundary Pass, Haro Strait, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This had the side effect of isolating Point Roberts, Washington.

=== As border ===

Although parts of Vancouver Island and parts of Eastern Canada are south of the 49th parallel, and parts of the United States (Alaska, Northwest Angle) are north of it, the term &quot;49th parallel&quot; is sometimes used metonymically to refer to the entire Canada–U.S. border. Actually, many of Canada&#x27;s most populated regions (and about 72% of the population) are south of the 49th parallel, including the two largest cities Toronto (43°42′ north) and Montreal (45°30′ north). The federal capital Ottawa (45°25′ north), and the provincial capital of seven provinces (Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and British Columbia) are south of the 49th parallel. Three provinces, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia, are each entirely south of the parallel, but the vast majority of Canadian territory lies north of it.

Parts of the 49th parallel were originally surveyed using astronomical techniques that did not take into account slight departures of the Earth&#x27;s shape from a simple ellipsoid, or the deflection of the plumb-bob by differences in terrestrial mass. The surveys were subject to the limitations of early to mid-19th century technology; consequently, in some places the surveyed border is several hundred feet from the geographical 49th parallel for the currently adopted datum, the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). The Digital Chart of the World (DCW), which uses the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid, reports the border on average at latitude 48° 59′ 51″ north, roughly south of the modern 49th parallel. It ranges between 48° 59′ 25″ and 49° 0′ 10″ north, and on either side of the average. In any case, the Earth&#x27;s North Pole moves around slightly, notionally moving the 49th and other parallels with it; see polar motion.

The Northwest Angle is the only part of the contiguous 48 states that goes north of the 49th parallel as surveyed. The Treaty of Paris called for the boundary between the US and British territory to pass through the most northwesterly point of Lake of the Woods, and this was retained even after an 1818 treaty set the boundary west of that point to follow the 49th parallel.

At the time that the United States and Great Britain agreed on the 49th parallel as the boundary, much of the North American continent had not yet been mapped. After the boundary was established, British surveyors discovered that Point Roberts lay south of the 49th parallel. The British requested that the United States cede the territory to Great Britain, but no action was ever taken.

In 1909 the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada signed and ratified a treaty confirming the original survey lines as the official and permanent international border. Nevertheless, in 2002 the difference of the survey from the geographical 49th parallel was argued in front of the Washington Supreme Court in the case of &quot;State of Washington v. Norman&quot;, under the premise that Washington did not properly incorporate the portions of land north of the geographical 49th parallel, as laid out by detailed GPS surveying. The court decided against the premise, ruling that the internationally surveyed boundary also served as the state boundary, regardless of its actual position.

<text>Arachnophobia is a 1990 American horror comedy film directed by Frank Marshall in his directorial debut from a screenplay by Don Jakoby and Wesley Strick. Starring Jeff Daniels and John Goodman, the film follows a small California town that becomes invaded by a deadly spider species and the town&#x27;s residents&#x27; struggles against them to avert an ecological crisis.

The film was the first produced by Hollywood Pictures, a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios. &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; was released in the United States on July 18, 1990. The film received positive critical reviews and grossed $53.21 million on a $22 million budget.

== Plot ==

In a Venezuelan tepui, British entomologist James Atherton captures two members of an aggressive, newly discovered species of spider of prehistoric origin. The spiders lack sex organs, indicating that they are laborers or soldiers, thereby existing as a hive (atypical of spiders). A fertile male of the same species bites bedridden American nature photographer Jerry Manley, who has a severe seizure from the venom and dies. The scientist sends Manley&#x27;s body back to his hometown of Canaima, California, unaware that the spider has crawled into the coffin.

Manley&#x27;s desiccated body arrives at the mortuary of mortician Irv Kendall. The spider escapes from the coffin, is picked up by a crow and bites the bird. The crow falls dead outside the barn of Ross Jennings, a family physician who has moved from San Francisco to take over the practice of the retiring town doctor. Ross and his son both suffer from arachnophobia.

He is short of patients after Sam Metcalf, the elderly town doctor, hesitates about retiring. The Venezuelan spider mates with a house spider in the Jennings&#x27; barn. The domestic spider produces hundreds of infertile, drone offspring with their father&#x27;s lethal bite, and they leave the nest after consuming their mother.

Ross&#x27;s first patient, Margaret Hollins, dies after being bitten by one of the new spiders, and he doubts Metcalf&#x27;s diagnosis of a heart attack. Another arachnid kills high school football player Todd Miller just after Ross conducted a routine team checkup, earning him the nickname of &quot;Dr. Death&quot;. The next victim is Metcalf himself, who is bitten and dies in front of his wife.

With Metcalf dead, Ross becomes Canaima&#x27;s town doctor. Knowing that Metcalf was bitten by a spider and an iota of an unknown toxin was detected in his body, he suspects that the town may be infested by deadly arachnids.

Ross calls Atherton and asks him to help his investigation. The skeptical entomologist sends Chris Collins, his assistant. Ross and county coroner Milt Briggs order that Margaret and Miller be exhumed. They perform autopsies, and Chris confirms Ross&#x27;s suspicion after he identifies bite marks. Ross and Chris catch two of the spiders (one had died of a natural cause) in Metcalf&#x27;s house the following day. When Chris mentions the new species discovered by Atherton, Ross realizes that the town&#x27;s killer spiders and Atherton&#x27;s discovery are related.

Atherton joins Ross, Chris, Milt, Sheriff Lloyd Parsons, and exterminator Delbert McClintock in Canaima, and they discover the spiders have a short lifespan due to their crossbreeding. Atherton tells them that the spiders are soldiers sent to eliminate potential threats for the male spider leading the colony, which he calls &quot;the general&quot;. He learns that the general produced a queen and inbred with her to produce a second nest (guarded by the queen) which could produce fertile offspring, culminating in the species&#x27; next stage of evolution and worldwide dispersal.

Ross, Chris, and Delbert discover that one nest is in Ross&#x27;s barn. When he destroys the nest, Delbert finds Atherton dead. He had attempted to catch the general and purposely touched a strand of the web to coax the spider out, but was bitten by the male spider which then escaped. Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar: the spiders&#x27; second nest, guarded by both the queen &quot;and&quot; the general.

After he electrocutes the queen, Ross battles the general while he tries to burn the second egg sac (overcoming his fear of spiders by focusing on his need to stop them). Trapped by fallen debris as the general prepares to bite him, Ross stays perfectly still until the general is in position, then flings the spider into the fire. Despite being badly burnt, the general leaps out from the fire just as the egg sac hatches. Ross shoots the general with a nail gun, sending the flaming spider into the egg sac and destroying the nest. Delbert rescues Ross: with the general, the queen and the nests destroyed and the soldiers dying, the spiders&#x27; threat is over. Deciding that they missed their old life, the Jennings family returns to San Francisco. Celebrating their safe return home, an earthquake hits, which they prefer over deadly spiders.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
Steven Spielberg was involved with &quot;Arachnophobia&quot;, with Frank Marshall (one of his earlier producers) directing for the first time. Spielberg and Marshall were the film&#x27;s executive producers, and Amblin Entertainment received a production credit. Marshall intended that the film would be reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot;: &quot;People like to be scared but laughing, like a roller coaster. No one wants to be terrified&quot;. &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; also bears similarities to the 1977 film &quot;Kingdom of the Spiders&quot;.

Jamie Hyneman of &quot;MythBusters&quot; said in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; that &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; was one of the first films on which he worked, and he often relied on simple magnets for effects. The film used over 300 Avondale spiders from New Zealand, chosen for their large size, unusually social lifestyle, and harmlessness to humans; they were guided around the set by heat and cold.

&quot;Arachnophobia&quot; was primarily filmed in Cambria, California; the introductory and jungle scenes were filmed in southern Venezuela. The school scenes were filmed at Coast Union High School, with students and staff used in the football scenes and group events; players in the locker room were CUHS student athletes. For the sound effect of spiders being crushed, Foley artists stepped on mustard packages or potato chips. For the sound effect of the spiders crawling through the heating ducts, long fingernails were used on pieces of tin to create the scurrying sound.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Arachnophobia&quot; was the first film released by Hollywood Pictures. Advertisers were uncertain if they should market it as a thriller or a comedy, and television commercials for the film called it a &quot;thrill-omedy&quot;.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Arachnophobia&quot; debuted at number three (behind &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;), earning $8 million over its first weekend. The film was a financial success, grossing $53,208,180 domestically and an additional $30 million in video rentals.

=== Critical response ===
In &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot;, film critic Leonard Maltin calls &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; a &quot;slick comic thriller&quot;, praising the acting with a caveat: &quot;Not recommended for anyone who&#x27;s &quot;ever&quot; covered their eyes during a movie&quot;. Writing for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen compared the film to B movies &quot;about the small town threatened by alien invaders&quot;, calling it well-made but &quot;oddly unresonant&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said that the film made audiences &quot;squirm out of enjoyment, not terror&quot;, and gave it three out of four stars.

&quot;Arachnophobia&quot; has a 93% rating based on 44 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Arachnophobia&quot; may not deliver genuine chills, but it&#x27;s an affectionate, solidly built tribute to Hollywood&#x27;s classic creature features.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Some people interested in spiders protested against the film, believing that it tarnished the public&#x27;s view of spiders.

=== Accolades ===
== Legacy ==
Researchers at the University of California, Riverside named a newly discovered worm species after Jeff Daniels&#x27; role in this movie. The worm, &quot;Tarantobelus jeffdanielsi&quot;, is one of only two known worms known to infect tarantulas.

== Merchandising ==
The video-game version of &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; was released in May 1991 for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and DOS. Nicholas Edwards wrote a novelization of the film. Hollywood Comics (an imprint of Disney Comics) released a comic-book adaptation of the film, written by William Rotsler with art by Dan Spiegle. The characters in the comic adaptation bear little resemblance to those in the film.

An &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; soundtrack album was released on July 18, 1990. It included Trevor Jones&#x27;s instrumental music from the film, dialogue excerpts, and songs such as &quot;Blue Eyes Are Sensitive to the Light&quot; by Sara Hickman, &quot;Caught in Your Web (Swear to Your Heart)&quot; by Russell Hitchcock, and &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; by Tony Bennett.

== Remake ==
On June 2, 2022, it was announced that Atomic Monster and Amblin Partners would produce a remake of the film. The film is expected to be co-produced by James Wan and Michael Clear, executive produced by Frank Marshall (who directed the original film), and written and directed by Christopher Landon.

<doc id="328349" wikidata="Q23288" url="?curid=328349" title="Petauridae">
<text>Petauridae is a family of possums containing 11 species: four species of trioks and striped possum (genus &quot;Dactylopsila&quot;), six species of wrist-winged glider (genus &quot;Petaurus&quot;), and Leadbeater&#x27;s possum (&quot;Gymnobelideus leadbeateri&quot;), which has only vestigial gliding membranes. Most of the wrist-winged gliders are native to Australia, whereas most of the striped possums to New Guinea, but some members of each group are found on both sides of the Torres Strait. Leadbeater&#x27;s possum is endemic to Victoria, Australia.

== Evolution ==
All petaurids have obvious facial markings, a well-defined dorsal stripe, very large lower front incisors, and four-cusped molars. Despite their distinctive appearance, petaurids are closely related to the ringtail possums (family Pseudocheiridae) and are grouped together with them to form the superfamily Petauroidea.

The wrist-winged gliders are omnivorous, specialising on sap and nectar, but taking a wide variety of supplemental foods. The gliders appears to have evolved in the open forests of Australia—gliding membranes are an adaptation which aids mobility when the forest canopy is incomplete, and are of little use in rainforests— but now has representatives in New Guinea and many of the smaller islands nearby. Their similarities to the unrelated flying squirrels are an example of convergent evolution.

The striped possums, on the other hand, are thought to have evolved on New Guinea; the sole Australian species (the striped possum of Cape York) is considered a recent immigrant. All members of this genus are insectivores, and have specialised structures for catching insects: a heel-like structure on the wrist that is thought to be used to tap on wood to locate insect larvae, and an elongated fourth finger to extract them from their burrows.

== Taxonomy ==
The listing for extant species is based on The Third edition of Wilson &amp; Reeder&#x27;s Mammal Species of the World (2005), except where the Mammal Diversity Database and IUCN agree on a change. The family consists of the following three genera and 11 species:

* Genus &quot;Dactylopsila&quot;
** Great-tailed triok, &quot;Dactylopsila megalura&quot;
** Long-fingered triok, &quot;Dactylopsila palpator&quot;
** Tate&#x27;s triok, &quot;Dactylopsila tatei&quot;
** Striped possum, &quot;Dactylopsila trivirgata&quot;
* Genus &quot;Gymnobelideus&quot;
** Leadbeater&#x27;s possum, &quot;Gymnobelideus leadbeateri&quot;
* Genus &quot;Petaurus&quot;
** Northern glider, &quot;Petaurus abidi&quot;
** Yellow-bellied glider, &quot;Petaurus australis&quot;
** Biak glider, &quot;Petaurus biacensis&quot;
** Sugar glider, &quot;Petaurus breviceps&quot;
** Mahogany glider, &quot;Petaurus gracilis&quot;
** Squirrel glider, &quot;Petaurus norfolcensis&quot;

<doc id="328351" wikidata="Q3922532" url="?curid=328351" title="Soviet combat vehicle production during World War II">
<text>Soviet armoured fighting vehicle production during World War II from the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 was large. Although the Soviet Union had a large force of combat vehicles before the German invasion, heavy losses led to a high demand for new vehicles. Production was complicated by the loss of production facilities in the western part of the Soviet Union, and entire factories were moved east of the Ural Mountains to put them out of reach of the Germans. In general, Soviet tanks had less interior space than the tanks of other nations (which made them smaller targets) – this was possible because the Red Army only employed soldiers of small stature in their tank forces.

Combat experience in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), the Battles of Khalkhin Gol (1939) and the Winter War (1939–1940) showed the Soviet military that light tanks (such as the T-26) were too lightly armoured and that multi-turreted tanks (such as the T-35) were inferior to single turret tanks which guided the switch to the later vital T-34 medium and KV-1 heavy tanks.

Figures are up until the first half of 1945 and only include new production. The Soviet Union had 25,664 or 25,481 armoured fighting vehicles on 1 June 1941 before it entered the war.

Armoured vehicles under about could be produced and rebuilt in many light industrial installations, such as automotive, streetcar, and light tractor factories. Most were driven by standard automotive engines.

For these reasons light tank production continued well into the war, even though the medium T-34 was much more cost-effective. Foreign light tanks continued to be delivered under Lend-Lease, but domestic production would be replaced by cheaper armoured cars and the plentiful SU-76M self-propelled gun, which was simpler but packed a bigger high-explosive punch.

The SU-76 was a 76 mm gun mounted on a lengthened version of the T-70 chassis.

== Medium armoured fighting vehicles ==

Building and overhauling heavier armoured vehicles required specialized heavy machinery. Their main components were produced and assembled in facilities which also built heavy tractors, artillery, locomotives, and ship components.

The T-34 tank&#x27;s basic design was optimal, and continual development of industrial processes allowed it to be produced in greater numbers than any other armoured vehicle during the war.

Medium self-propelled guns were reasonably successful in the pure anti-tank role, but larger-calibre guns would become more common on heavier chassis, which could better handle their heavy recoil and carry an adequate provision of their large ammunition.

The T-28 was an older tank reaching the end of its production in 1940, and there were several hundred fielded already.

The T-34 was originally armed with a 76-mm gun; this was upgraded to a higher-velocity 76-mm, then finally to an 85-mm gun in a bigger turret. The production given for the T-34/85 in 1945 is the full production of that year.

The SU-85, SU-122 and SU-100 were all casemate-enclosed self-propelled guns mounted on the chassis of the T-34. The SU-85 and the later SU-100 mounted high-velocity guns and were designed for anti-tank work. The SU-122 mounted the lower-velocity 122-mm M-30 howitzer, and was mainly used as battlefield assault artillery against infantry.

==Heavy armoured fighting vehicles==

Soviet heavy tank production was constantly in danger of cancellation during the war, and only continued thanks to constant improvement and liberal doses of political interference. These vehicles required significantly more resources to produce than the T-34 medium tank, and were always outmatched by it in some significant way. The most successful were the later IS-2 tank and heavy self-propelled guns, whose large-calibre firepower was generally useful against both soft and hard targets. Soviet high command had examined and rejected the 100mm D-10s Gun for the IS2, despite its very high penetration, as it was not able to provide the high explosive support needed against soft targets.

=== Heavy tanks ===
The KV-1 (named after Kliment Voroshilov) was armed with a 76 mm gun; as with the T-34, the length of the gun was increased during production. The KV-1S was a version of the KV-1 with lighter armour (making it faster) and a new turret (still with a 76 mm gun). KV-85 was a KV-1S fitted with an 85 mm gun in the same turret as the IS-1.

After Voroshilov lost political favour, the new KV-13 model with the KV-85&#x27;s turret and gun was renamed IS-1 after Joseph (&quot;Iosif&quot;) Stalin. It was soon upgraded to a new turret with high-velocity 122 mm gun, and renamed IS-2, finally giving a slow, expensive heavy tank one clear superiority over the medium T-34.

The IS-3 was an IS-2 with new, advanced hull and turret armour. It saw no combat in World War II.

The KV-8 was a flamethrower tank.

=== Heavy self-propelled guns ===

The KV-2 used the same hull as the KV-1 but was armed with a 152 mm howitzer in a huge turret - which could not even rotate on uneven terrain - and was intended for use against fortified targets and infantry. The SU-152 was a 152 mm howitzer, casemate-housed on a KV-1S hull. Like the KV-2 it was intended for use as an assault weapon against infantry, but used the cheaper and less exposed &quot;Samokhodnaya Ustanovka&quot;-designated style of casemate mount.

The ISU-122 and ISU-152 were self-propelled guns on casemate-fitted IS hulls. They were both used as heavy assault guns; and both were useful as Anti Tank weapons. The 122s D25 Gun could penetrate almost any German tank, and the 152s ML20 had long been used against enemy armour; although it had a low velocity, the massive shell could inflict considerable damage through concussive effects.

<text>An anastomosis (, : anastomoses) is a connection or opening between two things (especially cavities or passages) that are normally diverging or branching, such as between blood vessels, leaf veins, or streams. Such a connection may be normal (such as the foramen ovale in a fetus&#x27; heart) or abnormal (such as the patent foramen ovale in an adult&#x27;s heart); it may be acquired (such as an arteriovenous fistula) or innate (such as the arteriovenous shunt of a metarteriole); and it may be natural (such as the aforementioned examples) or artificial (such as a surgical anastomosis). The reestablishment of an anastomosis that had become blocked is called a reanastomosis. Anastomoses that are abnormal, whether congenital or acquired, are often called fistulas.

The term is used in medicine, biology, mycology, geology, and geography.

==Etymology==
Anastomosis: medical or Modern Latin, from Greek ἀναστόμωσις, anastomosis, &quot;outlet, opening&quot;, Greek ana- &quot;up, on, upon&quot;, stoma &quot;mouth&quot;, &quot;to furnish with a mouth&quot;. Thus the &quot;-stom-&quot; syllable is cognate with that of &quot;stoma&quot; in botany or &quot;stoma&quot; in medicine.

==Medical anatomy==

An anastomosis is the connection of two normally divergent structures. It refers to connections between blood vessels or between other tubular structures such as loops of intestine.

===Circulatory===
In circulatory anastomoses, many arteries naturally anastomose with each other; for example, the inferior epigastric artery and superior epigastric artery, or the anterior and/or posterior communicating arteries in the Circle of Willis in the brain. The circulatory anastomosis is further divided into arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial anastomosis includes actual arterial anastomosis (e.g., palmar arch, plantar arch) and potential arterial anastomosis (e.g. coronary arteries and cortical branch of cerebral arteries). Anastomoses also form alternative routes around capillary beds in areas that do not need a large blood supply, thus helping regulate systemic blood flow.

===Surgical===
Surgical anastomosis occurs when segments of intestine, blood vessel, or any other structure are connected together surgically (anastomosed). Examples include arterial anastomosis in bypass surgery, intestinal anastomosis after a piece of intestine has been resected, Roux-en-Y anastomosis and ureteroureterostomy. Surgical anastomosis techniques include linear stapled anastomosis, hand sewn anastomosis, end-to-end anastomosis (EEA). Anastomosis can be performed by hand or with an anastomosis assist device. Studies have been performed comparing various anastomosis approaches taking into account surgical &quot;time and cost, postoperative anastomotic bleeding, leakage, and stricture&quot;.

===Pathological===
Pathological anastomosis results from trauma or disease and may involve veins, arteries, or intestines. These are usually referred to as fistulas. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and skin (enterocutaneous fistula). Portacaval anastomosis, by contrast, is an anastomosis between a vein of the portal circulation and a vein of the systemic circulation, which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with portal hypertension, often resulting in hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, or caput medusae.

==Biology==

===Evolution===
In evolution, anastomosis is a recombination of evolutionary lineage. Conventional accounts of evolutionary lineage present themselves as the branching out of species into novel forms. Under anastomosis, species might recombine after initial branching out, such as in the case of recent research that shows that ancestral populations along human and chimpanzee lineages may have interbred after an initial branching event. The concept of anastomosis also applies to the theory of symbiogenesis, in which new species emerge from the formation of novel symbiotic relationships.

===Mycology===
In mycology, anastomosis is the fusion between branches of the same or different hyphae. Hence the bifurcating fungal hyphae can form true reticulating networks. By sharing materials in the form of dissolved ions, hormones, and nucleotides, the fungus maintains bidirectional communication with itself. The fungal network might begin from several origins; several spores (i.e. by means of conidial anastomosis tubes), several points of penetration, each a spreading circumference of absorption and assimilation. Once encountering the tip of another expanding, exploring self, the tips press against each other in pheromonal recognition or by an unknown recognition system, fusing to form a genetic singular clonal colony that can cover hectares called a genet or just microscopical areas.

For fungi, anastomosis is also a component of reproduction. In some fungi, two different haploid mating types – if compatible – merge. Somatically, they form a morphologically similar mycelial wave front that continues to grow and explore. The significant difference is that each septated unit is binucleate, containing two unfused nuclei, i.e. one from each parent that eventually undergoes karyogamy and meiosis to complete the sexual cycle.

Also the term &quot;anastomosing&quot; is used for mushroom gills which interlink and separate to form a network.

=== Botany ===

The growth of a strangler fig around a host tree, with tendrils fusing together to form a mesh, is called anastomosing.

==Geosciences==

===Geology===
In geology, veins of quartz (or other) minerals can display anastomosis.

Ductile shear zones frequently show anastomosing geometries of highly-strained rocks around lozenges of less-deformed material. 

Molten lava flows sometimes flow in anastomosed lava channels or lava tubes.

In cave systems, anastomosis is the splitting of cave passages that later reconnect.

===Geography and hydrology===

Anastomosing rivers, anastomosing streams consist of multiple channels that divide and reconnect and are separated by semi-permanent banks formed of cohesive material, such that they are unlikely to migrate from one channel position to another. They can be confused with &quot;braided rivers&quot; based on their planforms alone, but braided rivers are much shallower and more dynamic than anastomosing rivers. Some definitions require that an anastomosing river be made up of interconnected channels that enclose floodbasins, again in contrast with braided rivers. 

Rivers with anastomosed reaches include the Magdalena River in Colombia, the upper Columbia River in British Columbia, Canada, the Drumheller Channels of the Channeled Scablands of the state of Washington, US, and the upper Narew River in Poland. The term anabranch has been used for segments of anastomosing rivers.

Braided streams show anastomosing channels around channel bars of alluvium.

<text>The Other Wind is a fantasy novel by the American author Ursula K. Le Guin, published by Harcourt in 2001. It is the fifth and final novel set in the fictional archipelago Earthsea. It won the annual World Fantasy Award for Best Novel and was runner up for the Locus Award, Best Fantasy Novel, among other nominations.

&quot;The Other Wind&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Tehanu&quot;, the fourth novel, and to &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, one story collected in &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot;.

== Plot ==
Alder, a minor village sorcerer who is adept at mending, has been tormented by dreams since the death of his beloved wife Lily. Every time he falls asleep, he is brought to the wall of stones, the border between the world of the living and the Dry Land of the dead. The dead, including Lily, beseech him to be set free. He sought guidance from the masters of the school of wizardry on Roke island. The Master Patterner advises him to seek out Ged on the island of Gont. Ged, the ex-Archmage, is powerless as a wizard, but knows more of the world of the dead than anyone living. Alder finds Ged, who is alone at the time, as his Kargish wife Tenar and adopted daughter Tehanu have been summoned to Havnor to counsel King Lebannen. Ged listens to Alder&#x27;s tale and recommends he go to Havnor to speak to both the king and his family.

Alder sails to the big island of Havnor and tells his story to the already assembled council. Lebannen is concerned, but has other worries. The king of the Kargs, a warlike people from the East who despise sorcery, has sent his daughter to marry Lebannen as the price for peace between them, a demand that angers Lebannen. Furthermore, dragons have been menacing the islands in the archipelago closest to their territory on the western-most islands. Soon after Alder arrives, dragons encroach further into the archipelago than ever before, finally to Havnor itself. The king and his people ride to negotiate with them. Tehanu goes with him because she appears to have some kinship with dragons, having as a young girl summoned the great dragon Kalessin, who called her ‘daughter’, but is now departed, “flying on the other wind”. She speaks to one of the raiding dragons who delivers a cryptic message, to the effect that the dragons are angry that men have stolen part of their lands in the furthest west. The dragons do, however, agree to a truce, and to send an emissary.

The dragon Orm Irian arrives shortly after, taking human form of a young woman to address the king and his council. The legends of the dragons, the mages, and the Kargs are retold and compared. It is revealed that dragons and men were once one people, but parted ways: Dragons chose a life of freedom and immortality in the Furthest West, while men chose a life of mastery, power, and rebirth, promising to give up magic. However, men reneged on their bargain, and the first mages cast spells that stole some of the beautiful Western Lands from the dragons, for men to go to after death. But in their attempt to create an eternal life, the old mages had instead created the Dry Land, a grim, unchanging, desolate place where their souls languished forever. The party decide to sail to Roke, the center of the world, to seek a resolution.

The King&#x27;s party debates with the masters of the great school of magic on what course of action to take. The two groups travel together magically to the Dry Lands to the Wall of Stones, which the dead are vainly attempting to tear down. Alder begins to dislodge a stone, each stone in the wall as seen in the Dry Lands being one of the spells used to carve it out of the dragons&#x27; Western Lands. Alder is joined by Tehanu, then the others, each using magic to unmake the wall. Once the wall is sufficiently breached, the imprisoned dead rush free to return to the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, and Alder is reunited with his wife Lily and dies. The dragon Kalessin arrives and completes the demolition, and the Dry Land returns to its beauty and is rejoined with the dragons&#x27; Western Lands. Tehanu is finally able to transform into an uncrippled dragon.

After the balance of the world is restored, the king marries the Kargish princess, whom he has come to love and admire, and Tenar returns to Gont and to Ged.

== Analysis ==

&quot;The Other Wind&quot; continues the stories of Earthsea characters Lebannen, Tenar, Tehanu, and, in a minor role, Ged, from the previous books. With the exception of Tehanu, these characters are already fully developed, and there is little further development.

Tehanu, now a young woman, is still very shy and emotionally dependent upon her adoptive mother, Tenar. Nevertheless, she reluctantly agrees to accompany the King on a mission to meet and parley with the dragons, in part because she can innately understand their speech. On their first encounter with a dragon, despite the creature&#x27;s apparent hostility and her own particular fear of fire, Tehanu rides forward to meet it in the hope that it would recognize and honor her kinship with the eldest dragon Kalessin who called her &quot;daughter&quot; in the book &quot;Tehanu&quot;. In the denouement of the &quot;Other Wind&quot;, Tehanu transforms herself into dragon form, and is thus freed from the burden of the injury humans inflicted upon her human body in childhood.

The theme of reconciliation underlies this book. In addition to Tehanu&#x27;s personal reconciliation with her own nature, the sorcerer Alder is reconciled with his dead wife, Lebannen with his future bride, and through that marriage, a lasting peace with Kargad is forged. The disparate lores of Paln, Roke, and Kargad are each shown to be imperfect reflections of the true history of the world. The spells which were intended to create a perpetual afterlife, that stole away the Dry Land, are dissolved; with its boundary removed, the arid place revives and merges back into the dragons&#x27; Western Lands, from which it had been carved away thousands of years ago. The dead at last gain their release from the Dry Lands, and the cycle of death and rebirth is re-established for all.

During the Edo period the area prospered from its location as a major lodging place on Ōshū Kaidō, which is one of the Edo Five Routes, and was the commercial center in the region. The area was mostly administered as an exclave of Takada Domain under the Tokugawa Shogunate. After the Meiji restoration, it was organized as part of the Nakadōri region of Iwaki Province.

The village of Sukagawa was formed on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. However, after mid-Meiji period, the municipality was eclipsed by Kōriyama, which had succeeded in inviting the junction of West Ban&#x27;etsu Line with the Tōhoku Main Line train routes. On March 31, 1954, Sukagawa was elevated to city status after merging with the town of Hamada and villages of Nishibukuro and Inada (all from Iwase District), and the village of Oshioe (from Ishikawa District). Later, Sukagawa absorbed Niida Village (from Iwase District) on March 10, 1955, and then absorbed Ohigashi Village (from Ishikawa District) on February 1, 1967. On April 1, 2005, Sukagawa absorbed the town of Naganuma and village Iwase (both from Iwase District).

After the earthquake of 2011, the Fujinuma Dam collapsed resulting in seven fatalities. See also Radiation effects from Fukushima I nuclear accidents.

<doc id="328364" wikidata="Q2911280" url="?curid=328364" title="Borough Park, Brooklyn">
<text>Borough Park (also spelled Boro Park) is a neighborhood in the southwestern part of the borough of Brooklyn, in New York City. The neighborhood is bordered by Bensonhurst to the south, Dyker Heights to the southwest, Sunset Park to the west, Kensington and Green-Wood Cemetery to the northeast, Flatbush to the east, and Mapleton to the southeast.

It is economically diverse and home to one of the largest Orthodox Jewish communities outside Israel, with one of the largest concentrations of Jews in the United States. With Orthodox and Haredi families having an average of 6.72 children, Boro Park is experiencing a sharp growth in population.

The neighborhood is part of Brooklyn Community District 12, and its primary ZIP Code is 11219. It is patrolled by the 66th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically, it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 38th, 39th, and 44th Districts.

== History ==
=== Early development and railroads ===
Originally, the area was called Blythebourne, a small hamlet composed of cottages built and developed in 1887 by Electus Litchfield, and then expanded with more housing by developer William Reynolds. It was served by the Brooklyn, Bath, and Coney Island, a steam railroad that is today&#x27;s elevated BMT West End Line (); the line ran from Green-Wood Cemetery to Coney Island when it was built in the 1860s. This line was put on an elevated structure in 1917.

The Sea Beach Railroad was another steam railroad. This railroad was named after the Sea Beach Palace Hotel, its southern terminal in 1879. In 1913, it was electrified and placed in an open cut; it now serves the .

In 1902, State Senator William H. Reynolds bought the land northeast of Blythebourne. The new area was then named Borough Park. Blythebourne was absorbed into Borough Park by the 1920s.

=== Jewish settlement ===
Jewish immigrants began populating Borough Park at the turn of the 20th century, beginning in 1904–1905. By 1914, a YMHA had formed and purchased a lot on 58th Street and 14th Avenue on which to build a large facility. Through the 1930s, 13th Avenue was lined with pushcart vendors and pickle sellers. In the late 1930s, the city opened a public market on 42nd Street to force an end to the pushcart trade.

During the late 1920s and early 1930s, many Yemenite Jews emigrated from both Yemen and Palestine, creating their own small enclave in Borough Park. They established their own synagogue and named it Ohel Shalom. The synagogue moved from a small storefront building to 12th Avenue and 44th street when they purchased an old church.

In the 1980s, the neighborhood changed demographically — from one of Italian, Irish, and Modern Orthodox Jewish to Hasidic Jewish families. By 1983, an estimated 85 percent of the residents of Borough Park were Jewish. New shops and restaurants opened on 13th Avenue to serve the expanding Orthodox Jewish community. In 1987, two of the most popular stores debuted: Eichler&#x27;s Judaica bookstore, and Kosher Castle Dairy Cafeteria. New stores also opened, selling imported goods and computer technology. At the end of the 1990s, businesses began selling electronics and Jewish books, music, and videos to overseas customers via the Internet. The area continued developing into a very large Jewish enclave around that time period.

==== &quot;Baby Boom Capital&quot; nickname ====
In the 2000 United States Census, it was reported that an estimated 76,600 Jews lived in Borough Park. Since that time, Borough Park has grown significantly, and was given the title of &quot;baby boom capital&quot; of New York City by the &quot;New York Post&quot; because of the high birth rate. The population in 2011 was 140,000. The neighborhood recorded 4,523 births in 2004, the highest in the city. The closest Brooklyn neighborhood in terms of population growth was Williamsburg, home to many Satmar Hasidim, which reported 3,839 births. Borough Park&#x27;s birth rate, 24.4 per 1,000 residents, has translated into growth in the neighborhood.

Many of these births occur at Maimonides Medical Center, a hospital in the Borough Park area. The Maimonides Infants &amp; Children&#x27;s Hospital of Brooklyn is fully accredited as a &quot;children&#x27;s hospital within a hospital&quot;, one of three such facilities in New York City. Here, at The Stella and Joseph Payson Birthing Center, Maimonides handles more births than any other hospital in New York State.

The size of many Hasidic families often requires larger homes, and this has fueled construction and renovation projects across the neighborhood. The majority of these projects involve larger bedrooms and kitchens. A 1998 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that, &quot;Since 1990, the Building Department has issued more permits for private construction projects — new homes and additions — in the Borough Park area than in any other residential neighborhood in Brooklyn.&quot; These construction projects were aided with a new law passed in 1992, which established Borough Park as a special zoning district where residents could build on 65% of their lot, thus reducing the size of setbacks and backyards.

=== Business development ===
Thirteenth Avenue, a commercial strip roughly one mile in length from 39th to 55th Streets, features storefronts supplying Jewish households. Many Hasidic Jews shop at these stores, coming from all parts of the city, other states, and even other countries to buy kosher items. Businesses have benefited from the growing Jewish population, the increasing density of the neighborhood, and the use of the Internet.

The community receives many visitors, especially among Israeli expatriates and tourists. The Park House Hotel between 12th and 13th Avenues on 48th Street, the first kosher hotel in Borough Park, was established in 1987. In 1999, a kosher hotel called &quot;The Avenue Plaza Hotel&quot; opened on 13th Avenue, becoming the first new hotel to appear in the neighborhood in more than a decade. These hotels along with many area merchants specifically accommodate the needs of visiting Hasidic tourists.

== Religion ==
Borough Park is home to many Hasidic groups, the largest being the Bobov sect (including Bobov-45). The Boyan, Belz, Ger, Satmar, Karlin-Stolin, Vizhnitz, Munkacz, Spinka, Klausenburg, Skver, and Puppa communities also reside here, among others. There is a minority of Haredi non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jews (typically called Litvish or Yeshivish) and Sephardic Jews, with a smaller number of Modern Orthodox Jews.

In Brooklyn, about 37% of Jews consider themselves Orthodox, and Borough Park is often referred to as the &quot;heartland&quot; or &quot;home&quot; for New York&#x27;s Orthodox Jewish population. The neighborhood became largely Orthodox since the 1970s, making a transformation sometimes referred to as &quot;suburb to shtetl&quot;.

During much of the early 1900s, the Jewish population in Borough Park, and Brooklyn as a whole, was part of a much more liberal-leaning voting block. However, many of these early Jewish families moved to the suburbs or other places around the city, while more conservative Hasidic Jews (many of them survivors of the Holocaust and immigrant families from Eastern Europe) joined their neighborhoods. As a result, the overwhelming majority of the Hasidic population in Borough Park and Brooklyn introduced a more traditional Jewish religious lifestyle. A 2002 study by the UJA Federation-New York revealed that only 2% of Borough Park&#x27;s Jews identified themselves as Reform Jews, and nearly three-fourths identified themselves as Orthodox Jews.

=== Religious observances ===

The Orthodox Jewish population adheres strongly to halakha (Jewish law) and the Shulkhan Arukh (halakhic code), following religious laws in their daily lives. Saturday is the Shabbos (Ashkenazi pronunciation of Hebrew Shabbat, Jewish Sabbath), a day of rest, which is strictly observed by Orthodox members of the Jewish community. In some areas, a siren is sounded on Friday before sundown, to indicate the arrival of the Shabbos. Culturally and religiously, the Jewish population of the neighborhood is considered one of the most Orthodox in the world, as &quot;[m]any families do not own televisions or attend movies. The children attend yeshivas, instead of public schools. Adolescent girls do not leave the house without making certain that their knees and elbows are covered, and at weddings and funerals alike, women and men sit separately, to avoid physical contact, as required by religious law.&quot; Additionally, stores in Borough Park sell or prepare only kosher food made under rabbinical supervision. There was a large controversy surrounding the erection of an &quot;eruv&quot; in Borough Park, because of differing interpretations of the application of Jewish law. An eruv was built in 1999–2000, and encompasses about 225 blocks in Borough Park. Its use is still the subject of controversy.

Mikvahs (Jewish ritual baths) are scattered across the neighborhood, as it is considered a vital part of Orthodox Jewish life. It is rather difficult to identify, as it is not usually explicitly advertised, to promote privacy among its users.

=== Bobov ===
Borough Park is home to the headquarters of Hasidic Judaism&#x27;s large Bobov community (including Bobov-45) numbering an estimated several thousand families. It is one of Brooklyn&#x27;s largest Hasidic communities, and also has followers in Canada, England, Belgium, and Israel.

=== Satmar ===
Satmar is one of the largest Hasidic groups in Brooklyn. It is characterized by extreme religious rigidity, complete rejection of modern culture, and fierce anti-Zionism. Satmar sponsors a comprehensive education system. It has two large boys&#x27; schools in Borough Park: one on 53rd Street, between 13th and 14th Avenues; and the other at 54th Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway. Their largest girls school, Bais Ruchel, is on 14th Avenue, between 53rd and 54th Street; the building served as a New York City public school until its purchase in 1979 by United Talmudical Academy, Satmar&#x27;s educational arm.

== Education ==
Borough Park generally has a lower ratio of college-educated residents than the rest of the city . While 32% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 23% have less than a high school education and 45% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 40% of Brooklynites and 38% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Borough Park students excelling in reading and math has been increasing, with reading achievement rising from 50 percent in 2000 to 53 percent in 2011, and math achievement rising from 46 percent to 70 percent within the same time period.

Borough Park&#x27;s rate of elementary school student absenteeism is lower than the rest of New York City. In Borough Park, 11% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, compared to the citywide average of 20% of students. Additionally, 77% of high school students in Borough Park graduate on time, higher than the citywide average of 75% of students.

===Schools===
The New York City Department of Education operates the public schools in the neighborhood, which comprises District 20. 180 Homewood School, a zoned public K-8 school, receives many bused-in students from other neighborhoods, including Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst. Many elementary schools have had mixed results from this student drain; for example, in 2004, a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter stated that PS 164 was &quot;at only 89 percent of capacity because many children in the community attend yeshivas (Jewish private schools). Classes are small, the hallways quiet, the principal and assistant principal know every student by name.&quot; Subsequently, the percentage of children reading at or above the grade level has increased to 55% in 2004 from 40% in 1998 in an otherwise unchanged school.

Most Boro Park parents send children to yeshivas. In fact, virtually all the large population of school-children born into the neighborhood&#x27;s Hasidic families attend local yeshivas for boys and Bais Yaakov-type schools for girls. This had diminished the student population of local schools, such as The Montauk Intermediate School. The New York City Department of Education hoped to take advantage of the empty space and construct a small school, called the Kingsborough Early College School, inside Montauk. The Hasidic community was not pleased by the prospect of a new public school because it would bring &quot;a bad element&quot; (a supposed euphemism for immodestly attired girls), and protested the decision. The Community Educational Council heard these complaints and decided against expanding its public school system. Instead, an all-girls 6–12 school, the Urban Assembly for School for Criminal Justice moved in, and occupies part of the 3rd floor and the entire 4th floor of the building with its over 500 girls. In addition, The Montauk School now serves mostly Asian students; and nearly a third of its nearly 1000 students are English as a New Language students. Together, the schools service nearly 1600 students, above the target capacity of 1422 students.

=== Library ===
The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL)&#x27;s Borough Park branch is located at 1265 43rd Street near 13th Avenue.

== Transportation ==
The New York City Bus routes serve the area, as well as the private bus route to the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Williamsburg. The New York City Subway&#x27;s BMT West End Line, serving the , is at 55th Street, 50th Street, and Fort Hamilton Parkway. The IND Culver Line, serving the , runs along McDonald Avenue, the eastern border of Borough Park. The BMT Sea Beach Line on the also serves the neighborhood at Fort Hamilton Parkway.

Borough Park&#x27;s major avenues run from north to south, and its major shopping districts are on 13th, 16th, and 18th Avenues.

<doc id="328372" wikidata="Q2892166" url="?curid=328372" title="Bay Ridge, Brooklyn">
<text>Bay Ridge is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is bounded by Sunset Park to the north, Dyker Heights to the east, the Narrows and the Belt Parkway to the west, and Fort Hamilton Army Base and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to the south. The section of Bay Ridge south of 86th Street is sometimes considered part of a sub-neighborhood called Fort Hamilton.

Bay Ridge was formerly the westernmost portion of the town of New Utrecht, comprising two smaller villages: Yellow Hook to the north and Fort Hamilton to the south. Yellow Hook was named for the color of the soil and was renamed Bay Ridge in December 1853 to avoid negative connotations with yellow fever at the time; the name Bay Ridge was chosen based on the local geography. Bay Ridge became developed as a rural summer resort during the mid-19th century. The arrival of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Fourth Avenue Line (present-day ) in 1916 led to its development as a residential neighborhood. Bay Ridge is known for its Norwegian community but it also has small Irish, Italian, Arab and Greek communities.

Bay Ridge is part of Brooklyn Community District 10, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11209 and 11220. It is patrolled by the 68th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically, it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 43rd District.

==History==

=== Early settlements ===
South Brooklyn was originally settled by the Canarsee Indians, one of several indigenous Lenape peoples who farmed and hunted on the land. Their main village in the area was Nyack. The Canarsee Indians had several routes that crossed Brooklyn, including a path from Fulton Ferry along the East River that extended southward to Gowanus Creek, Sunset Park, and Bay Ridge. The Canarsee traded with other indigenous peoples, and by the early 17th century, also with Dutch and English settlers.

The first European settlement at Bay Ridge occurred in 1636 when Willem Adriaenszen Bennett and Jacques Bentyn purchased between 28th and 60th Streets, in what is now Sunset Park. However, after the land was purchased in the 1640s by Dutch settlers who laid out their farms along the waterfront, the Canarsee were soon displaced, and had left Brooklyn by the 18th century. Present-day Bay Ridge was the westernmost portion of New Utrecht, founded in 1657 by the Dutch. The area consisted of two sister villages: Yellow Hook to the north, named for the color of the soil, with &quot;Hook&quot; from the Dutch &quot;hoek&quot;, meaning &quot;corner&quot; and Fort Hamilton to the south, named for the military installation at its center.

Yellow Hook was mostly farmland until the late 1840s. In 1848, Third Avenue within the area was widened. Two years later, a group of artists moved to the area and founded a colony called Ovington Village, named after the family who owned the farmland in the area. Around 1853, Yellow Hook changed the community&#x27;s name to avoid association with yellow fever. &quot;Bay Ridge&quot; was suggested by local horticulturist James Weir after the area&#x27;s most prominent geographic features: the high ridge that offered views of New York Bay. The natural beauty attracted the wealthy, who built country homes along Shore Road, overlooking the water.

The first settlers referred to Fort Hamilton as the Nyack Tract, after the Native American tribe that lived there. Fort Hamilton began to develop in the 1830s as a resort destination when the corresponding military fortification was created. The mostly-immigrant laborers in the area started to create a community to the fort&#x27;s north and west, which included stores, houses, churches, and a school. The community was linked by stagecoach to New Utrecht, Gowanus, and downtown Brooklyn, as well as by ferry to Staten Island and Manhattan.

In the mid-19th century, a large number of country houses were built in Bay Ridge, especially along Shore Road, which faced the New York Harbor to the west. The advent of the telephone allowed estate owners to communicate with their businesses in Manhattan while enjoying their stays at the elegant estates of Bay Ridge. Through this period Greek Revival, Italianate, and Gothic Revival villas were built on Shore Road; many of these villas were constructed by the descendants of the area&#x27;s original settlers. Development in Bay Ridge continued through the 1890s. One of the most prominent organizations in Bay Ridge was the Crescent Athletic Club, a football club built in 1884, which contained a summer clubhouse, boathouse, and playing fields. By the late 19th century, it was anticipated that a series of parkways would be built across Brooklyn, connecting Bay Ridge to Eastern Parkway, Ocean Parkway, and Prospect Park. As such, several wide, tree-lined streets were laid through the neighborhood, including 75th Street (now Bay Ridge Parkway); Fort Hamilton Parkway; and Shore Road.

=== Rapid development and subway construction ===
Until the late 19th century, Bay Ridge would remain a relatively isolated rural area, reached primarily by stagecoaches, then by steam trolleys after 1878. In 1892, the first electric trolley line was built in Brooklyn, starting at a ferry terminal at 39th Street and running via Second Avenue to 65th Street, and then via Third Avenue. The Fifth Avenue Elevated was then extended to Third Avenue and 65th Street. This had the effect of raising land prices: one entity, the Bay Ridge Improvement Company, was able to buy land for in 1890, and then sell land off for $1,000 per lot several years later.

Real estate speculation commenced at the beginning of the 20th century. A building boom in South Brooklyn started in about 1902 and 1903, and thousands of people started coming to the area from Manhattan and from other places. The first definite plans for a Fourth Avenue subway (today&#x27;s ) were proposed by Rapid Transit Commission engineer William Barclay Parsons in 1903, and two years later, a citizens&#x27; committee was created to aid the creation of the subway line. The announcement of the subway line resulted in the immediate development of row houses in Bay Ridge. In 1905 and 1906 realty values increased by about 100 percent, and land values increased due to the promise of improved transportation access. Such was the rate of development, houses were being sold before they were even completed, and land prices could rise significantly just within several hours.

The subway itself faced delays. In 1905, the Rapid Transit Commission adopted the Fourth Avenue route to Fort Hamilton; following approval by the Board of Estimate and mayor of New York City, the route was approved by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. Bids for construction and operation were let, but in 1907, the Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the Public Service Commission (PSC). For much of 1908, there were legal disagreements about whether the project could be funded while remaining within the city&#x27;s debt limit. The PSC voted unanimously for the Fourth Avenue subway line in March 1908, but the Board of Estimate did not approve contracts for the line until October 1909. By then, a non-partisan political body, with the backing of 25,000 South Brooklyn residents, was created that would only support candidates in the municipal election that pledged support for the Fourth Avenue subway. Groundbreaking for the first section of the subway, between DeKalb Avenue and 43rd Street took place in 1909. Not long after the contracts were awarded, the PSC started negotiating with the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company in the execution of the Dual Contracts, which were signed in 1913. During the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway was recommended as part of the Dual System, which was approved in 1912. Construction began on the sections between 61st–89th Streets and between 43rd–61st Streets in 1913, and was completed two years later.

The line opened to 59th Street on June 21, 1915, and was extended to 86th Street on January 15, 1916, at which time development started to accelerate. At the time, Bay Ridge extended northward to what is now present-day Sunset Park. Industrial developments were constructed along the waterfront north of present-day 65th Street, such as Bush Terminal (now Industry City), and those were considered to be within Bay Ridge. By the 1920s, the number of apartment buildings had increased fivefold, replacing old farms, homesteads and houses. Schools, churches, stores, movie theaters, and other structures were also created to serve the growing population. The Fourth Avenue subway was extended further to Bay Ridge–95th Street in 1925, by which point Bay Ridge&#x27;s population had more than doubled since 1900. By World War II, almost all of these large houses had been replaced with apartment buildings.

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many Norwegian and Danish sailors emigrated to Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge and neighboring Sunset Park; Lapskaus Boulevard, referring to the salted Norwegian beef stew, is the nickname of Eighth Avenue in this area.

=== Staten Island connection and later years ===

There had been plans to build the Staten Island Tunnel, a railroad or subway tunnel, from Bay Ridge to Staten Island as early as 1890. By the 1910s, there were two proposals to build a tunnel splitting from the Fourth Avenue subway in Bay Ridge, either at Fort Hamilton or at between 65th and 67th Streets. The plan for the tunnel from 65th-67th Streets was ultimately selected and work started in 1923, though the project was halted two years later. In 1927, two years after the cancellation of the Staten Island Tunnel, engineer David B. Steinman brought up the possibility of constructing a vehicular bridge, the &quot;Liberty Bridge&quot;, across the Narrows. The tunnel proposal was also revived with the announcement of the Liberty Bridge, and proposals for vehicular and rail tunnels were both considered. The bridge was disapproved by the United States Department of War in 1934, and plans for a bridge were revived in 1936. By the time the bridge was approved by the city&#x27;s Board of Estimate in 1943, residents of Bay Ridge had turned against it, citing a detrimental impact to the neighborhood&#x27;s character.

Robert Moses, the chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), announced the revival of plans for what would become the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1947. U.S. Representative Donald Lawrence O&#x27;Toole, whose constituency included Bay Ridge, opposed the proposal for the bridge in part because he believed it would damage the character of Bay Ridge. The U.S. military approved the proposal anyway, and in 1957, Moses proposed expanding Brooklyn&#x27;s Gowanus Expressway and extending it to the Narrows Bridge by way of Seventh Avenue, which would require cutting through the middle of Bay Ridge. This proposal drew opposition from the community, who wanted the approach to follow the Belt Parkway along the Brooklyn shore. After holding a hearing for concerned Bay Ridge residents, the Board of Estimate affirmed the Narrows Bridge plan in October 1958, though this angered Bay Ridge residents since the construction of the approach would displace 7,500 people. Also destroyed was Fort Lafayette, part of New York City&#x27;s defense system along with Fort Hamilton and Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island; it was replaced by the base of the bridge&#x27;s east tower. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964.

The 2007 Brooklyn tornado hit this area, specifically 68th Street and Bay Ridge Avenue between Third and Fourth Avenues. Eleven houses had to be vacated after they suffered significant damage, and many of the trees on the two blocks toppled, landing on cars and stoops. The 4th Avenue Presbyterian Church had its very large stained glass window blown out. As the tornado lifted, it peeled the roof of a nearby Nissan dealership and deforested 40% of Leif Ericson Park. The tornado has been rated EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds between 111 and 135 MPH.

== Community ==


Bay Ridge is well known for its Norwegian community. By 1971, the 55,000-strong Norwegian community of Bay Ridge boasted that it was the fourth-largest Norwegian &quot;city&quot; in the world. Residents also compared Eighth Avenue&#x27;s string of Norwegian businesses to Oslo&#x27;s Karl Johans gate. The community continues to host the annual Norwegian Constitution Day Parade, also known as the Syttende Mai Parade, in which hundreds of people in folk dress proceed down Third Avenue. The celebration ends in Leif Ericson Park, where &quot;Miss Norway&quot; is crowned near the statue of Leif Ericson. The statue was donated by Crown Prince Olav, Prince of Norway, on behalf of the nation of Norway in 1939. Nordic Delicacies, a Norwegian gifts-and-groceries store, operated until 2015.

, Bay Ridge still maintains a sizable Norwegian population at around 30,000 individuals. Later in the 20th century, like other areas in southern and southwestern Brooklyn, there was an increase in the number of Irish, Italian, Greek, Russian, Polish, Jordanians, Lebanese, Syrian, Egyptian and to a lesser extent Chinese, people living in Bay Ridge. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Middle Eastern, North African, and Arab Americans moved to Bay Ridge, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; referring to it as &quot;the heart of Brooklyn&#x27;s Arab community&quot;. The neighborhood also has many Muslim residents, particularly in its northern area bordering the Sunset Park neighborhood. Bay Ridge is one of the largest Arab-American communities in the United States, and the largest in New York City.

In addition to the large Norwegian, Irish, Italian, and Arab American communities, there are sizable numbers of Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and—to a lesser extent—Central Americans and Dominicans in Bay Ridge.

Bay Ridge has many ethnic restaurants, especially along Third and Fifth Avenues, its main commercial strips. Sentiments against residents and workers of Asian descent rose in 2020.

Bay Ridge has a large elderly population. It has been called a naturally occurring retirement community (NORC) as many of its families have grown up in the neighborhood while their children moved away. In 2006, it was reported that 20% of the population of Bay Ridge was 60 years of age or more.

===News===
Local newspapers include &quot;The Home Reporter, Sunset News&quot;, &quot;The Bay Ridge Courier&quot;, and &quot;Bay Ridge News&quot;. The neighborhood is also often covered by &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;. These newspapers publish other local offshoots: &quot;The Home Reporter&quot; also publishes &quot;The Spectator&quot;; the &quot;Courier&quot;″s parent company also publishes &quot;The Brooklyn Paper&quot;; and the &quot;Eagle&quot; publishes a weekly digest called &quot;Bay Ridge Life&quot;.

===Development===
In the 1990s and 2000s, many decades-old two-family houses were demolished and replaced by condominiums known colloquially as &quot;Fedder Homes&quot;, after the branded air conditioners poking out from the buildings&#x27; facades. In 2005, local community leaders and community activists from across the political spectrum united to issue rezoning laws. The six-story apartment complexes lining Shore Road are among the tallest buildings in the neighborhood.

==Landmarks==

===Points of interest===
* 8200 Narrows Avenue House, (commonly referred to as the &quot;Gingerbread House&quot;), designed by James Sarsfield Kennedy in 1917, is a city landmark.
* American Veterans Memorial Pier (commonly referred to as the 69th Street Pier) at Bay Ridge Avenue and Shore Road is the community&#x27;s key seaside recreation spot. Sports fishermen travel to fish the waters of &quot;The Bay Ridge Anchorage&quot; and along the seawall promenade that runs south from the pier to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and east along Gravesend Bay. The pier features a sculpture that emits a beam of light as a memorial to those who died in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Commuter ferry service operated between this pier and the St. George Ferry Terminal in Staten Island from 1912 until 1964, the year the Verrazzano Bridge opened. Ferry service to Wall Street and points along the western coast of Brooklyn began in 2017 from the pier as part of NYC Ferry&#x27;s South Brooklyn route.
* Bennet-Farrell-Feldman House, located at 119 95th Street, was built in 1847 and is now an official city landmark. An accompanying structure, thought to have been used as a barn, couldn&#x27;t be saved and was demolished. Legend has it the house was turned so that its &quot;widow&#x27;s walk&quot;, a balcony that traditionally faces the sea so women left at home could watch for their husbands&#x27; ships, would no longer face the Narrows.
* Doctors&#x27; Row, a series of houses along Bay Ridge Pkwy between Fourth and Fifth Avenues (see )
* Fort Hamilton, an active military base near the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge (see )
* The Houses at 216–264 Ovington Ave. were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.
* Owl&#x27;s Head Park (also known as Bliss Park), in the neighborhood&#x27;s northwest corner, was previously the private estate of the Bliss Family, for whom nearby Bliss Terrace is named. They sold what remained of the estate to the city in 1928 for $850,000, after Eliphalet Williams Bliss specified in his will 25 years earlier that he wanted the city to buy the land and convert it into parkland. Before them, a portion of the property was owned by Henry C. Murphy, a former Mayor of Brooklyn, ambassador, congressman and New York State Senator for whom the nearby Senator Street is named. Remnants of the estate—mansion, stable, observation tower—were still visible into the 1930s and 40s, when they were finally demolished, having been left to fall into disrepair. It is a walking park that has a state of the art skate park, dog run, children&#x27;s playground and basketball courts; it has the first concrete skatepark built in Brooklyn.
* The Senator Street Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.
* Shore Road Park New York Road Runners hosts a weekly open run.
* Step streets are public staircases in the middle of a street. As a rule they were placed on hills that were too steep to build a road for cars but still allow access to pedestrians.
* St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church was where Robert E. Lee served as a vestryman and where his future &quot;right hand&quot;, Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, was baptized. The building no longer hosts services.

Mike Long, who served as chairman of the Conservative Party of New York from 1988 to 2019, owned a liquor store and resided in the district. The community is also considered a Republican stronghold. An exception was Democrat Sal Albanese, who was elected to the neighborhood&#x27;s City Council seat in 1983, defeating the 21-year incumbent Republican-Conservative Minority Leader Angelo G. Arculeo, and went on to represent the district for 15 years. After the 1990 census, the area was split into two Assembly districts to eliminate a Republican Assembly Seat. The political landscape began to change with population shifts over the 1990s and early 2000s, when the multigenerational white ethnic population began to die or move from the area.

<text>Nicholas M. Schenck (14 November 1880, Rybinsk, Russia – 4 March 1969, Florida) was a Russian-American film studio executive and businessman.

==Biography==
===Early life===
One of seven children, Schenck was born to a Jewish household in Rybinsk, a town on the Volga River in the Yaroslavl Governorate of Tsarist Russia. With his parents, he and his brothers, George and Joseph, emigrated to the United States in 1892 where they settled in a tenement on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. Subsequently, he relocated to Harlem, the population of which at that time consisted primarily of Jewish and Italian immigrants. 

Upon his arrival in the United States, he and his older brother Joseph worked as a team running errands and selling newspapers while studying at the New York College of Pharmacy at night. 

They subsequently began working in a drugstore in the Bowery. Within two years they had saved up enough money to buy out the drugstore&#x27;s owner and opened another store on Third Avenue at 110th Street and began casting about for other business ventures.

===Career===

One summer day, the Schencks took a trolley ride to Fort George Amusement Park, in uptown Manhattan, and noticed that thousands of people were milling around idly waiting for the return trains. The brothers rented a beer concession and also provided some vaudeville entertainment. It was at this time that the Schencks made the acquaintance of Marcus Loew, a theater operator. Loew persuaded them to buy two film theaters and the brothers started to work with Loew in the theater business. Between approximately 1907 and 1919, they reinvested in real estate for nickelodeons, vaudeville, and eventually motion pictures.

In 1910, the Schencks&#x27; theaters were grouped into Loew&#x27;s Consolidated Enterprises. Loew, having noted the brothers&#x27; success, advanced them capital, permitting them to purchase Palisades Amusement Park in Bergen County, New Jersey, directly across the river from Manhattan, in 1910. It remained in operation until 1971, although the brothers sold their interest in 1934.

Schenck eventually became Loew&#x27;s right-hand man, helping him manage what rapidly grew into a vast theater chain. In 1919, Schenck was named as vice president and general manager of Loew&#x27;s Inc. 

Joseph relocated to Hollywood, eventually becoming president of United Artists Corporation. He helped shepherd Loew&#x27;s acquisition of Metro Pictures in 1920 and Goldwyn Pictures in 1924 to keep the theaters supplied with product. 

Loew soon realized he needed someone in Hollywood to run his studio interests. Schenck seemed the obvious choice, but Loew concluded that he needed Schenck in New York to help run the theaters. He bought a studio headed by independent producer Louis B. Mayer in 1924, merging the Loew&#x27;s Hollywood interests into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer with Mayer as studio chief. For reasons that remain unknown, Mayer and Schenck disliked each other intensely; Mayer reportedly called Schenck &quot;Mr. Skunk&quot; in private. It was the start of a testy relationship that would last for almost four decades.

In 1927, Marcus Loew died suddenly, leaving control of Loew&#x27;s to Schenck. In 1929, William Fox, head of rival studio Fox Film Corporation, arranged to buy controlling interest from Schenck. When Mayer found out about the sale, he was outraged; although he was a Loew&#x27;s vice president, he was not a shareholder and had no say in the deal. Mayer went to the Justice Department and, through his political connections, managed to get the deal stalled on antitrust grounds.

Shortly afterward, in the summer of 1929, Fox was seriously injured in a car accident. By the time he had recovered, the stock market crash had nearly wiped out his fortune. Schenck blamed Mayer for costing him millions, and this made an already icy relationship even worse.
However, due to the stock market crash, the Loew&#x27;s–Fox deal would have been dead even if the Justice Department had given the deal its blessing.

By 1932, Schenck was running an entertainment empire that consisted of a thriving theater circuit and MGM. The conglomerate, which Schenck continued to manage closely from New York City, employed 12,000 people. Schenck, by demanding a tight production schedule, created tension with Mayer and Irving Thalberg, who was production chief until his early death in 1936. Nonetheless, thanks to Schenck&#x27;s stringent management, MGM was successful, becoming the only film company that continued to pay dividends during the Great Depression.

Under Schenck&#x27;s leadership, the studio produced a great quantity of films, and the studio system allowed it to retain a wide array of talent under its roof: Lon Chaney, Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow, Wallace Beery, Clark Gable, Mickey Rooney, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Judy Garland, Robert Taylor, the Jeanette MacDonald–Nelson Eddy team and many others. Schenck&#x27;s adroit business sense made him a wealthy man. In 1927, he and Joseph were reported to be worth about $20 million (approximately $500 million in today&#x27;s money, possibly more), with a combined yearly income of at least a million. By some estimates, Nicholas Schenck was the eighth richest individual in the United States during the 1930s.

===After World War II===

Although Schenck&#x27;s power and prestige were at their peak after World War II, times were changing, as television loomed on the horizon. Like many in the motion picture industry, however, Schenck adamantly refused to get involved with the new medium. In 1951, Louis B. Mayer had a falling out with Schenck over Dore Schary&#x27;s position at MGM and Mayer was forced out of the studio.

By the middle of the decade, the price of MGM shares was sagging and stockholders were growing restive. On December 14, 1955, Arthur M. Loew, the son of Marcus Loew, succeeded Nicholas Schenck as the company&#x27;s president, although Schenck remained chairman of the board. The following year, when Arthur Loew resigned for health reasons, Schenck defied the other directors in the efforts to secure a new president. When Joseph R. Vogel became president, Schenck was named honorary chairman, but retired altogether later that same year.

Nicholas Schenck divided his last years between his estates at Sands Point, Long Island, and Miami Beach. The former, which he had purchased in 1942, consisted of a 20-acre (81,000 m2) property with a main house of 30 rooms, luxuriously appointed. It included a private movie theater and a 200-foot dock.

===Personal life===
Nicholas Schenck&#x27;s first marriage ended in divorce. In 1927, he married socialite and former vaudeville entertainer Pansy Wilcox (1898–1987), whose brother was director Fred M. Wilcox. Her sister was actress Ruth Selwyn (1905–1954), wife of Edgar Selwyn. 

Nicholas and Pansy had three daughters: Marti, who acted under the name Marti Stevens, Joanne (born August 1, 1932) and Nicola (born December 13, 1933, in New York). Nicola married actor Helmut Dantine; they had three children. She acted under the name Niki Dantine.

Schenck owned and raced Thoroughbred horses. His filly Cobul, who raced under his wife&#x27;s name, won the 1958 Astoria Stakes.

===Death===
Schenck died following a stroke in Florida in 1969.

==History==
Saanich has been the home to First Nations people for thousands of years. Saanich is on the territory of the Lək̓ʷəŋən peoples known today as Songhees &amp; Esquimalt Nations, the Malahat Nation and the Saanich Peoples. These Indigenous peoples have connections to the land and those traditions are carried on to this day. Non-Indigenous history begins with the arrival of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the 1840s.

The Craigflower Schoolhouse (originally called Maple Point School), the oldest surviving school building in Western Canada, was built on orders from Kenneth MacKenzie. He came from Scotland with his family in 1852, on the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company ship, &quot;Norman Morison&quot;, to establish a farm for the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, a subsidiary of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. A school was needed for the children of farm employees, as well as those of arriving settlers. 

The Municipality of Saanich was incorporated on March 1, 1906. The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory telescope was designed by John Stanley Plaskett, an astronomer with the Department of the Interior in Ottawa. The reflecting telescope was the largest of its kind in the world when it was built, though this was only the case for a few short months in 1918. The District of Saanich contains a long shoreline with sandy beaches located at several ocean bays. Two of the beaches are Cadboro Bay Beach and Cordova Bay Beach. Cadboro Bay is known as the home of the &quot;Cadborosaurus&quot;, a mythical cryptid. Saanich&#x27;s notable parks include PKOLS (Mount Douglas Park), Mount Tolmie Park (with viewpoints), and Cadboro-Gyro Park.

<text>David Keith McCallum (19 September 1933 – 25 September 2023) was a Scottish actor and musician, based in the United States. He gained wide recognition in the 1960s for playing secret agent Illya Kuryakin in the television series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E&quot; (1964–1968). 

His other notable television roles include Simon Carter in &quot;Colditz&quot; (1972–1974) and Steel in &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; (1979–1982). Beginning in 2003, McCallum gained renewed international popularity for his role as NCIS chief medical examiner Dr. Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard in the CBS television series &quot;NCIS&quot;, which he played for 20 seasons until his death in 2023. In film roles, McCallum notably appeared in &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), and as Judas Iscariot in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965).

==Early life==
David Keith McCallum was born on 19 September 1933 in Glasgow the second of two sons of orchestral violinist David Fotheringham and Dorothy McCallum (née Dorman), a cellist. When he was three, his family moved to London for his father to play as the leader of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in the Second World War, he was evacuated back to Scotland, where he lived with his mother at Gartocharn by Loch Lomond.

McCallum won a scholarship to University College School, a boys&#x27; independent school in Hampstead, London, where, encouraged by his parents to prepare for a career in music, he played the oboe. In 1946, at the age of 13, he began doing boy voices for the BBC radio repertory company.
 Also involved in local amateur drama, at age 17, he appeared as Oberon in an open-air production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; with the Play and Pageant Union. He left school at age 18 and was conscripted for National Service. He joined the British Army&#x27;s 3rd Battalion the Middlesex Regiment, which was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force. In March 1954, he was promoted to lieutenant. After leaving the army he attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where Joan Collins was a classmate.

==Career==

In 1951, McCallum became assistant stage manager of the Glyndebourne Opera Company. He began his acting career doing boy voices for BBC Radio in 1947 and taking bit parts in British films from the late 1950s. His first acting role was in &quot;Whom the Gods Love, Die Young&quot; playing a doomed royal. A James Dean-themed photograph of McCallum caught the attention of the Rank Organisation, who signed him in 1956. However, in an interview with Alan Titchmarsh broadcast on 3 November 2010, McCallum stated that he had actually held his Equity card since 1946.

His early roles included an outlaw in &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot;, (1957) junior radio operator Harold Bride in &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1958), and a juvenile delinquent in &quot;Violent Playground&quot; (1958). His first American film was &quot;&quot; (1962), directed by John Huston, which was shortly followed by a role in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot;. McCallum played Lt. Cmdr. Eric Ashley-Pitt in &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, which was released in 1963. He took the role of Judas Iscariot in 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. His other television roles included two appearances on &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; in the episodes &quot;The Sixth Finger&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Forms of Things Unknown&quot; (1964), and a guest appearance on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in 1964 as defendant Phillipe Bertain in &quot;The Case of the Fifty Millionth Frenchman&quot;.

===&quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;===

&quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, intended as a vehicle for Robert Vaughn, made McCallum into a sex symbol, his Beatle-style blond haircut providing a trendy contrast to Vaughn&#x27;s clean-cut appearance. McCallum&#x27;s role as the mysterious Russian agent Illya Kuryakin was originally conceived as a peripheral one. In fact, McCallum recalled in a 1998 interview that &quot;I&#x27;d never heard of the word &#x27;sidekick&#x27; before&quot;, when presented by his character&#x27;s description for the first time. McCallum, however, took the opportunity to construct a complex character whose appeal rested largely in what was shadowy and enigmatic about him. Kuryakin&#x27;s popularity with the audience as well as Vaughn and McCallum&#x27;s on-screen chemistry were quickly recognized by the producers, and McCallum was elevated to co-star status.

Although the show aired at the height of the Cold War, McCallum&#x27;s Russian alter ego became a pop culture phenomenon. The actor was inundated with fan letters, and a Beatles-like frenzy followed him everywhere he went. While playing Kuryakin, McCallum received more fan mail than any other actor in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s history, including such popular MGM stars as Clark Gable, Robert Taylor, and Elvis Presley. Hero worship even led to a record, &quot;Love Ya, Illya&quot;, performed by Alma Cogan under the name Angela and the Fans, which was a pirate radio hit in Britain in 1966. A 1990s rock-rap group from Argentina named itself Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas in honour of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; character.

McCallum received two Emmy Award nominations in the course of the show&#x27;s four-year run (1964–1968) for playing the intellectual and introverted secret agent. Describing his popularity during the show&#x27;s run, McCallum said, &quot;There is a practicality about it. You have to deal with it by not going to certain places. I was rescued from Central Park by mounted police once. When I went to Macy&#x27;s department store the fans did $25,000 worth of damage and they had to close Herald Square to get me out. That&#x27;s pretty classic, but you just have to deal with it. And then whoever was next came along, and you get dropped overnight, which is a relief.&quot;

McCallum and Vaughn reprised their roles of Kuryakin and Napoleon Solo in the 1983 television film, &quot;Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;. In 1986, McCallum reunited with Vaughn again in an episode of &quot;The A-Team&quot; entitled &quot;The Say U.N.C.L.E. Affair&quot;, complete with &quot;chapter titles&quot;, the word &quot;affair&quot; in the title, the phrase &quot;Open Channel D&quot;, and similar scene transitions.

In an interview for a retrospective television special, McCallum recounted a visit to the White House during which, while he was being escorted to meet the U.S. president, a Secret Service agent told him, &quot;You&#x27;re the reason I &quot;got&quot; this job.&quot;

===After &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;===

McCallum never quite repeated the popular success he had gained as Kuryakin until &quot;NCIS&quot;, though he did become a familiar face on British television in such shows as &quot;Colditz&quot; (1972–1974), &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1978), and ITV&#x27;s science-fiction series &quot;Sapphire &amp; Steel&quot; (1979–1982) opposite Joanna Lumley. In 1975, he played the title character in a short-lived U.S. series &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;.

McCallum appeared on stage in Australia in &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; (1987–1988), and the production toured the country. Other members of the cast were Jack Smethurst, Eric Sykes and Katy Manning.

McCallum played supporting parts in a number of feature films, and he played the title role in the 1968 thriller, &quot;Sol Madrid&quot;.

McCallum starred with Diana Rigg in the 1989 TV miniseries &quot;Mother Love&quot;. In 1991 and 1992 McCallum played gambler John Grey, one of the principal characters in the television series &quot;Trainer&quot;.
He appeared as an English literature teacher in a 1989 episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.
In the 1990s, McCallum guest-starred in two U.S. television series. In season 1 of &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, he appeared as the law-enforcement officer Frank Cobb of the fictional Broken Ridge of the Ausland Confederation, an underwater mining camp off the coast of Australia by the Great Barrier Reef; he also had a guest-star role in one episode of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; as Dr. Vance Hendricks in the Season 1 episode &quot;Infection&quot;.

In 1994, McCallum narrated the acclaimed documentaries &quot;&quot; for A&amp;E Networks. This was the second project about the &quot;Titanic&quot; on which he had worked: the first was the 1958 film &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, in which he had had a small role.

In the same year, McCallum hosted and narrated the TV special &quot;Ancient Prophecies&quot;. This special, which was followed soon after by three others, told of people and places historically associated with foretelling the end of the world and the beginnings of new eras for mankind.

In 1997, McCallum had a guest role in Season 7, Episode 22 of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, playing the neighbor of the murder victim.

===&quot;NCIS&quot;===
Beginning in 2003, starting with the original backdoor pilot on the series &quot;JAG&quot;, McCallum starred in the CBS television series &quot;NCIS&quot; as Dr. Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard, the team&#x27;s chief medical examiner and one of the show&#x27;s most popular characters. In Season 2 Episode 13 &quot;The Meat Puzzle&quot;, NCIS Special Agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander) asks Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), &quot;What did Ducky look like when he was younger?&quot; and Gibbs replies, &quot;Illya Kuryakin&quot;.

According to the behind-the-scenes feature on the 2006 DVD of &quot;NCIS&quot; season 1, McCallum became an expert in forensics to play Mallard, including attending medical examiner conventions. In the feature, Donald P. Bellisario says that McCallum&#x27;s knowledge became so vast that at the time of the interview, he was considering making him a technical adviser to the show.

McCallum appeared at the 21st Annual James Earl Ash Lecture, held 19 May 2005 at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, an evening for honouring America&#x27;s service members. His lecture, &quot;Reel to Real Forensics&quot;, with Cmdr. Craig T. Mallak, U.S. Armed Forces medical examiner, featured a presentation comparing the real-life work of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner staff with that of the fictional naval investigators appearing on &quot;NCIS&quot;.

In late April 2012, it was announced that McCallum had reached an agreement on a two-year contract extension with CBS-TV. The move meant that he would remain an &quot;NCIS&quot; regular past his eightieth birthday. In May 2014 he signed another two-year contract. He signed an extension in 2016, beginning a limited schedule in 2017 and from then renewed his contract for each season separately.

With series lead Mark Harmon&#x27;s departure from the show in the fall of 2021 (Season 19), McCallum became the last remaining member of the original &quot;NCIS&quot; cast until his death in 2023.

The Season 21 episode, &quot;The Stories We Leave Behind&quot;, is a posthumous tribute to both McCallum and to Dr. Mallard. It begins with Medical Examiner Jimmy Palmer finding Ducky had died at his home, the morning before he is set to help a young woman clear her USMC father&#x27;s name of desertion. The episode segues between the rest of the team trying to close this final case and them remembering Ducky&#x27;s insights and wisdom via flashbacks to previous episodes. At Ducky&#x27;s house, Jimmy first encounters Ducky&#x27;s dog Solo, a reference to Napoleon Solo, the partner of McCallum&#x27;s character Illya Kuryakin in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

===Music===
In the 1960s, McCallum recorded four albums for Capitol Records with music producer David Axelrod: &quot;Music...A Part of Me&quot; (Capitol ST 2432, 1966), &quot;Music...A Bit More of Me&quot; (Capitol ST 2498, 1966), &quot;Music...It&#x27;s Happening Now!&quot; (Capitol ST 2651, 1967), and &quot;McCallum&quot; (Capitol ST 2748, 1968). The best known of his pieces today is &quot;The Edge&quot;, which was sampled by Dr. Dre as the intro and riff to the track &quot;The Next Episode&quot;. McCallum&#x27;s version of &quot;The Edge&quot; appears on the soundtracks to the 2008 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; and the 2017 film &quot;Baby Driver&quot;.

McCallum did not sing on these records, as many television stars of the 1960s did when offered recording contracts. As a classically trained musician, he conceived a blend of oboe, cor anglais, and strings with guitar and drums, and presented instrumental interpretations of hits of the day. The official arranger on the albums was H. B. Barnum. However, McCallum conducted, and contributed several original compositions of his own, over the course of four LPs. The first two, &quot;Music...A Part of Me&quot; and &quot;Music...A Bit More of Me&quot;, have been issued together on CD on the Zonophone label. On &quot;Open Channel D&quot;, McCallum did sing on the first four tracks, &quot;Communication&quot;, &quot;House on Breckenridge Lane&quot;, &quot;In the Garden, Under the Tree&quot; (the theme song from the film &quot;Three Bites of the Apple&quot;), and &quot;My Carousel&quot;. The music tracks are the same as the Zonophone CD. This CD was released on the Rev-Ola label. The single release of &quot;Communication&quot; reached No. 32 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1966.

In &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; episode &quot;The Discotheque Affair&quot;, McCallum plays the double bass as part of a band in a night club. He also played guitar and sang his own composition, &quot;Trouble&quot;, with Nancy Sinatra on &quot;The Take Me to Your Leader Affair&quot;, and played several instruments in &quot;The Off-Broadway Affair&quot;.

In the 1970s, McCallum also recorded three H. P. Lovecraft tales for Caedmon Records, an imprint of August Derleth&#x27;s Arkham House publishing venture: &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot; (TC 1347, 1973); &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (&quot;slightly abridged&quot;; TC 1467, 1976); and &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot; (TC 1617, 1979).

===Writing===
In 2016, McCallum published a crime novel entitled &quot;Once a Crooked Man&quot;. The narrative is set in New York and London and centres on a young actor who tries to foil a murder. McCallum stated at the time that a second novel was in progress.

==Personal life==

On 11 May 1957, McCallum married actress Jill Ireland in London. They met during the production of the film &quot;Hell Drivers&quot;. The marriage legally ended in February 1967, after a separation of approximately two years. McCallum and Ireland had three sons: Paul, Jason, and Valentine (Val). Jason, who was adopted, died from an accidental drug overdose in 1989. 

On 16 September 1967, McCallum married fashion model-turned-interior designer Katherine Carpenter in Valley Stream, New York. The couple met at a photo shoot for &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine in 1965, and were together for 58 years. They had a son, Peter, and a daughter, Sophie. McCallum and his wife were active in charitable organisations that support the United States Marine Corps: Katherine&#x27;s father was a Marine who served in the Battle of Iwo Jima and her brother was killed in the Vietnam War. On 27 August 1999, McCallum was naturalized as a United States citizen. McCallum had six grandchildren. He was friends with Tibor Rubin.

==Death==
McCallum died at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on 25 September 2023, at the age of 90.

&quot;NCIS&quot; aired a tribute episode dedicated to McCallum on 19 February 2024.

Utensils for the Japanese tea ceremony, flower vases, and &quot;sake&quot; containers made from the Kasama ware pottery contributed to the economy.
After the Meiji Restoration, the town of Kasama was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, within Nishiibaraki District. The town of Shishido, a former castle town of Shishido Domain, was likewise established within Nishiibaraki District on the same day.

On March 19, 2006, Kasama absorbed the towns of Tomobe and Iwama (both from Nishiibaraki District), and the new city hall was located at the former Tomobe Town Hall. Tomobe became the new city&#x27;s administrative center, since it was more populous than the former Kasama town.

<doc id="328395" wikidata="Q6778445" url="?curid=328395" title="Marvin Olasky">
<text>Marvin Olasky (born June 12, 1950) is Christianity Today&#x27;s executive editor for news and global, a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, and an affiliate scholar at the Acton Institute. He also chairs the Zenger House Foundation and is the author of 29 books. From 1992 through 2021, he edited &quot;World.&quot;

==Education and career==
Olasky was born in the city of Malden, Massachusetts, to a Russian-Jewish family. He graduated from Newton High School (now Newton North High School) in 1968 and from Yale University in 1971 with a B.A. in American studies. In 1976, he earned his Ph.D. in American Culture at the University of Michigan. He became an atheist in adolescence and a Marxist in college, ultimately joining the Communist Party USA in 1972. Olasky married and divorced during this period and, according to Olasky, broke each of the Ten Commandments except &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;. He left the Communist Party late in 1973 and, in 1976, became a Christian after reading the New Testament and several Christian authors.

Olasky was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 to 2007, provost of The King&#x27;s College in New York City from 2007 to 2011, and Patrick Henry College&#x27;s distinguished chair in journalism and public policy from 2011 to 2019. He joined &quot; World&quot; Magazine in 1990 and became its editor in 1994 and its editor-in-chief in 2001. Earlier, he was a reporter at the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and a speechwriter at the Du Pont Company. Since 1996 he has been a ruling elder within the Presbyterian Church in America.

Olasky has chaired the boards of the City School of Austin and the Austin Crisis Pregnancy Center. His writings have been translated into Chinese, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, Russian, and other languages, and he has lectured and given interviews around the world.

==Writings and reception==
Olasky&#x27;s most famous book is &quot;The Tragedy of American Compassion&quot;, which in 1995 Newt Gingrich distributed to incoming Republican representatives of the 104th Congress. The book, an overview of poverty-fighting in America from colonial times to the 1990s, argues that private individuals and organizations, particularly Christian churches, have a responsibility to care for the poor and contends that challenging personal and spiritual help, common until the 1930s, was more effective than the government welfare programs of recent decades. Olasky argues that government programs are ineffective because they are disconnected from the poor, while private charity has the power to change lives because it allows for a personal connection between giver and recipient.

The book eventually helped to define &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; about welfare and social policy. In 1995, Olasky became an occasional advisor to Texas gubernatorial candidate George W. Bush. Bush made faith-based programs a significant component of his 2000 presidential campaign, and Olasky&#x27;s academic work helped form the basis for Bush&#x27;s &quot;compassionate conservatism.&quot; In 2001 and after that, Olasky and &quot;WORLD&quot; criticized the Bush administration for not following through on school choice or on ideas for tax credits to encourage more individual giving to poverty-fighting groups. In an interview with Mike Huckabee on October 10, 2009, Olasky denied that the Bush administration had implemented compassionate conservatism, remarking that &quot;it was never tried.&quot;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Olasky edited the 16-book &quot;Turning Point: A Christian Worldview Declaration&quot; series with Herbert Schlossberg, director of Howard Ahmanson Jr.&#x27;s Fieldstead Institute, which privately funded the series. Ahmanson has funded four of Olasky&#x27;s 28 books, and in 2006 Michelle Goldberg, author of the book &quot;Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism,&quot; placed Olasky in a crucial role in the Christian reconstructionism movement. Olasky points out that in 2003 he published a book, &quot;Standing for Christ in a Modern Babylon&quot;, that criticized reconstructionist ideas. Olasky has described himself as a Christian who believes in God&#x27;s sovereignty and man&#x27;s liberty.

Olasky argues in his 1996 book &quot;Telling the Truth&quot; that God created the world, knows more about it than anyone else, and explains its nature in the Bible, so &quot;biblical objectivity&quot; accurately depicts the world as it is. In contrast, conventional journalistic objectivity shows blind materialism or a balancing of subjectivities. He has emphasized the Christian origins of freedom of the press and investigative journalism, and teaches in a 2019 book how to advance biblical principles through street-level rather than suite-level reporting.

Olasky was prominent in the 1995–1996 welfare reform debate and came under attack when he contrasted George W. Bush&#x27;s first presidential campaign in 2000 with that of John McCain: &quot;It would be pushing it too far to talk of the religion of Zeus trumping the religion of Christ. McCain&#x27;s no polytheist. But a lot of liberal journalists have holes in their souls. Some of them grew up in nominally Christian homes but never really heard the Gospel; now, they look for a purpose in their lives but do not understand God&#x27;s grace. Others know more but don&#x27;t want to repent. So, McCain&#x27;s emphasis on the classical virtues gives them a post-Clinton glow without pushing them to confront their own lives.&quot;

Jonah Goldberg, who took exception to Olasky&#x27;s descriptions of both candidates, nonetheless recognized what Olasky was trying to say:
The Zeus reference seems to be derived from the ending of Tom Wolfe&#x27;s novel, &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, in which two of the characters decide to convert to Zeus worship. And what Olasky meant by it was that McCain supporters generally, and Brooks specifically, are attracted to &quot;Zeus-like strength&quot; rather than Christ-like compassion. McCain is all about honor and duty, and Bush is about charity and love. Zeus versus Christ. There you have it.

In her 2004 book &quot;Bushwomen&quot;, Laura Flanders writes, &quot;Olasky is not a fan of high-achieving women. Women joining the workforce have had &#x27;dire consequences for society,&#x27; he told a Christian magazine in 1998.&quot; Olasky later said in response to this book that he was praising the high achievements of women in major philanthropic organizations: &quot;From my study of the history of poverty-fighting in America, I found that it was women who ran the charitable enterprises. Men were involved, but it was essentially women who had the time to volunteer.&quot;

== Editing philosophy and practice ==

Olasky described &quot;World&quot; as a magazine that &quot;tries to be salt, not sugar. We like to report good news but don&#x27;t make it sticky-sweet. We also report bad news because Christ’s grace becomes most meaningful when we&#x27;re most aware of sin. We want to be tough-minded but warmhearted.&quot; In practice, that meant criticizing liberal policies but also corporate welfare and supporting challenging, personal, and spiritual help to the poor.

Olasky instituted a Daniel of the Year award for individuals who stood up to persecution. He furthered &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; by creating Hope Awards for Effective Compassion, given to Christian organizations that helped people rise from poverty. &quot;World&quot; also became known for reporting flash points in Sudan, Iraq, and China. In 2007, Olasky gave up his tenured position at The University of Texas to try to keep alive a struggling Christian college in New York City.

In 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;evangelical Protestant journalism is generally more public relations than reporting; &quot;World&quot; stands out as an exception. &#x27;We&#x27;re a Christian publication but not a movement organ,&#x27; Olasky said.&quot; That became even more evident in October 2016, after Donald Trump had consolidated his support among evangelicals. Olasky received about 1,500 critical letters when he wrote a cover story called Trump &quot;unfit for power&quot; and proposed that he step aside because &quot;we set the stage for even worse behavior when we ignore blatant offenses.&quot;

In 2019, Olasky wrote a book laying out his journalistic philosophy and emphasis on God&#x27;s objective sovereignty and man&#x27;s liberty. He explained biblical objectivity through the use of a whitewater rapids analogy that he says will help Christians avoid overusing the Bible (claiming &quot;God saith&quot; when He has not) or underusing it (ignoring God&#x27;s wisdom when it does not conform to our biases). He emphasized the importance of careful reporting rather than opinionating and noted that reporters do not have to be Christians to be biblically objective.

In 2021, after &quot;World&quot;&#x27;s editorial leader hired Al Mohler to edit the new World Opinions platform, Olasky resigned, as did WORLD Magazine&#x27;s seven other senior editors and reporters. The entire non-magazine editorial staff remained. In 2022, the Zenger House Foundation gave the first &quot;Zenger Prizes&quot; to eight journalists who emphasized &quot;street-level&quot; reporting rather than &quot;suite level&quot; opining. Prize winners included writers for secular as well as Bible-based publications. Olasky now writes a weekly column about homelessness.

In 2019, The Gospel Coalition reported Olasky saying, The heavens declare the glory of God, and the streets declare the sinfulness of man.&#x27;... Olasky expresses intense awareness of his own story of sin and Christ&#x27;s glory. Olasky, writing in 2008 soon after he had double-bypass surgery, said, &#x27;Christ changed my life a third of a century ago. Every year since then has been a gift.

== Personal life ==
Olasky has been married since 1976 to writer Susan Olasky, and they have four sons and six grandchildren. His book &quot;Lament for a Father&quot; tells the story of his parents, grandparents, and early life. Olasky has served as a PTA president and a Little League Baseball assistant coach, and has partaken in cross-country cycling.

<doc id="328397" wikidata="Q1675033" url="?curid=328397" title="Itako">
<text>, also known as or , are blind women who train to become spiritual mediums in Japan. Training involves severe ascetic practices, after which the woman is said to be able to communicate with Japanese Shinto spirits, &quot;kami&quot;, and the spirits of the dead. &quot;Itako&quot; perform rituals tied to communication with the dead and divination. The practice has been on the decline, with only 20 living &quot;itako&quot; in Japan, all more than 40 years old.

Training for &quot;itako&quot; traditionally began at a very young age, and included ritualized exposure to cold water. Hundreds of buckets of ice water could be poured on their bodies over the course of a few days. This education for &quot;itako&quot; takes about three years, and also includes memorization of songs and sutras. At the end of this training, a ceremony is held, announcing the marriage of the &quot;itako&quot; and her patron spirit.

Scholars suggest that blindness has long been associated with spiritual powers in Japan. Furthermore, options for those with severe vision impairment to become self-sufficient were limited in ancient times. This led many families to send young blind women to &quot;itako&quot; apprenticeships up until the start of the Meiji era, which outlawed &quot;itako&quot; rituals outright.

Today, &quot;itako&quot; are most commonly associated with Mt. Osore in Aomori prefecture. There, &quot;itako&quot; gather for an annual festival to channel the dead for thousands of tourists. &quot;Itako&quot; perform ceremonies to communicate with spirits of the recently deceased, including those of aborted and stillborn children.

== History ==
&quot;Itako&quot; are always blind, or have very poor vision. In pre-modern Japanese society, blindness was widely associated with spiritual capabilities; after the introduction of Buddhism, it was considered evidence of a karmic debt. These beliefs lent an aura of &quot;ambiguous sacred status&quot; to the blind. 
During the Edo era, women were expected to contribute to family wages. However, blind women of the era had limited opportunities to support themselves or their families. The reputation of blindness and spiritual abilities led many families to seek training for young girls, typically aged 11 to 13, in a folk religious tradition in which the young girl was wed to a deity, and there on able to communicate with spirits. Despite this power, blind women who became &quot;itako&quot; were still considered to occupy one of the lowest social strata within the community, especially those who relied on community support for financing their training.

&quot;Itako&quot; are thought to have risen from an ascetic cult of the Edo era, the &quot;yamabushi&quot;, male monks who were encountered during popular pilgrimages to the Kumano mountains in the 9th–10th centuries. These monks had wives who traveled with them, selling amulets and channeling the dead through trances. Meanwhile, women in the north performed the dances and rituals of shrine &quot;miko&quot;. Over time, the two groups merged, creating the modern concept of &quot;itako&quot;.

In 1873, the Meiji era government attempted to ban &quot;itako&quot; and their associated &quot;kuchiyose&quot; rituals as a means of encouraging the adoption of modernized medicine. An estimated 200 &quot;itako&quot; were practicing at the time. The law led to the arrest of mediums across Japan; by 1875, &quot;itako&quot; and their healing rituals were specifically targeted and could be arrested on sight. Arrests of &quot;itako&quot; were based on charges such as spreading superstition, to obstruction of medical practices. Newspaper accounts of these arrests indicate that &quot;itako&quot; were commonly attributing illnesses to possession of the ill by cats or foxes. Newspaper reports at the time tended to refer to &quot;itako&quot; in negative terms, and often associated the arrest of &quot;itako&quot; and the arrest of prostitutes. One editorial wrote, &quot;These miko disgorge reckless and empty gossip, squeezing the pockets of the common people, and prostitutes tempt loose men and rob them of their money. While the professions are different, they are the same in disrupting public morals and deceiving people of their possessions.&quot;

Public support, however, continued. Shortly before, and after, the surrender of Japan in 1945, many families sought out &quot;itako&quot; to communicate with the war dead, particularly those who were lost in combat abroad. Just before the end of the war, &quot;itako&quot; were also called upon to conduct &quot;living seances&quot; (&quot;ikiguchi&quot;) with soldiers overseas. An editorial by intellectual Orikuchi Shinobu at the time noted that the &quot;itako&quot; in Aomori prefecture had &quot;not been subject to prohibition&quot;, in contrast to &quot;itako&quot; and shaman in other prefectures, and that &quot;persecution would be counterproductive&quot;. News stories reported locals occasionally interfering with the police attempts to arrest prominent &quot;itako&quot;.

Today, the small number of living &quot;itako&quot; gather annually during the Obon holiday at Mt. Osore in Aomori, known locally as &quot;Mount Dread&quot;. The gathering has received televised news coverage since the 1960s.

== Description ==
&quot;Itako&quot; typically carry several artifacts. These include a kind of box called a , which contains secret items that may be representative of a protective spirit, or &quot;kami&quot;. Blacker describes an old folk tale tying the box, and its contents, to an &quot;inugami&quot; ritual. In this ritual, a dog is buried up to its neck and starved, while staring at food too far for it to reach. The &quot;itako&quot; place the animal&#x27;s skull into a box and offer its spirit a daily offering of food. In return, the spirit enters homes of her patrons and provides detailed information about the dead.

&quot;Itako&quot; also carry a black cylinder, often bamboo, containing another protective charm and their certificate of &quot;itako&quot; training. The cylinders are said to be used to trap the spirits of animals that attempt to possess a human being. Finally, the women carry , which are used in ceremonies and made up of beads and animal bones. The bones are typically jaw bones of deer or foxes, but have also included bear teeth, eagle claws, or shells.

==Definition==
The term &quot;itako&quot; has associations with beggars, and some mediums reject the use of the term. One theory suggests the term derived from &quot;eta no ko&quot;, or &quot;child of the &quot;eta&quot;&quot;, referring to the Japanese burakumin social class who were once associated with death. Other possible derivations include the use of wood pieces, &quot;ita&quot;, for the ceremonial writing of the name of the deceased.

The &quot;itako&quot; (then &quot;ita&quot;) are first referenced in poem #1773 of the ancient Nara period poem collection, the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. Anthropologist Wilhem Schiffer describes a local legend about the practice of recruiting blind women into shamanism. According to this legend, the practice began in an undetermined era when blind children were killed every 5 years. A local official, impressed with a blind woman&#x27;s ability to describe her environment despite her lack of vision, determined that the blind must have special powers. Rather than being killed, he pressed for the blind to study necromancy.

&quot;Itako&quot; is the common term for these women in Aomori, Iwate and Akita prefectures, but the term can vary by location. They are also commonly called &quot;ogamisama&quot; in southern Iwate and Miyagi prefectures; &quot;miko, mogodo, onakama&quot; or &quot;waka&quot; in Yamagata prefecture; and &quot;waka&quot; in Fukushima, Tochigi and Ibaraki.

===&quot;Kamisama&quot;===
There are similarities to another group of shaman women, the &quot;kamisama&quot;. Both &quot;kamisama&quot; and &quot;itako&quot; believe in a marriage to a spirit, and both follow the Buddhist deity Fudo Myoo. However, kamisama are sighted, typically claiming prophetic powers in the aftermath of a traumatic disease. Unlike &quot;itako&quot;, they are associated with small Shinto shrines, which they may operate themselves. Kamisama tend to view &quot;itako&quot; with suspicion, though ethnographers have found that kamisama often associate themselves with &quot;itako&quot; and &quot;itako&quot; traditions.

==Rituals==

&quot;Itako&quot; are said to have the ability to communicate with both kami and the dead. An &quot;itako&quot;&#x27;s role varies depending on the spirit she is connected to. Ceremonies vary by prefecture, but typically &quot;itako&quot; are called upon to communicate with kami spirits to garner favor or advisement on harvests, or to communicate with the spirits of the dead, particularly the recently deceased. The rituals typically take place on Mount Osore, which is locally associated with this &quot;traditional&quot; ritual, though evidence suggests &quot;itako&quot; withdrew to the mountain to escape pressure from the Meiji state. The ceremony had traditionally taken place in the ancestral home of the dead.

Ceremonies draw on a series of Shinto practices, but most often call upon Buddhist gods. Some chants of the itako are similar to secret practices of Yoshida Shinto, and may be tied to practices at Ise shrine.

Itako perform the ceremony using Tsugaru dialect, and a series of &quot;taboo words&quot; that are not understood by all native Japanese speakers. Locals, who understand the Tsugaru dialect, are therefore often employed as translators for the &quot;itako&quot;. Folklorists suggest that this allows the &quot;itako&quot; to avoid any need to personalize the communication from the departed spirit.

===&quot;Kuchiyose&quot;===
The ritual of contact with the dead, , has been named an intangible cultural heritage asset of Japan. The ritual has been documented as early as 1024 AD in the .

The ritual is held during a funeral or anniversary of a death, though some &quot;itako&quot; claim the dead cannot be contacted until 100 days have passed. Once the spirit communicates its own status in the afterlife, patrons receive advice and predictions for the future.

Visitors to the &quot;itako&quot; typically bring fruit, candy or other gifts, and offer the age, relationship, and gender of the deceased, but not the name.

During the ceremony, purifying rice and salt are scattered, and a spirit is said to enter the body of the &quot;itako&quot;. Gods are called forward and asked to compel the desired spirit or ghost to come forward. Calling the dead usually involves calling upon a hierarchy of spirits in reverse order, beginning with kami and rising to the level of ghosts. Then, the local kami is called forward to protect those attending the ceremony. During the summoning of the deceased (&quot;hotoke oroshi&quot;), the itako sings songs, called &quot;kudoki&quot;, said to be relayed by the contacted spirit. The spirit of the dead arrives and shares memories of its life and the afterlife, answering questions for patrons. Then, the spirits are sent away, and songs are sung about &quot;hell, insects, and birds.&quot; A final spell is repeated three times: “The old fox in the Shinoda woods, when he cries during the day, then he does not cry in the night”. The interaction lasts about 15 minutes.

As recently as 1962, ethnographers observing &quot;itako&quot; rituals noted a shaking of hands and use of special voices when channeling the dead. More recent observers note that &quot;itako&quot; sang in their own voices, without any visual performance of entering a trance-state. The ritual songs are typically repeated to many patrons, suggesting that the &quot;itako&quot; are understood, even by their patrons, to be theatrical performers. Nonetheless, a survey of 670 people with chronic illnesses in the area around Osorezan Mountain, home of many &quot;itako&quot;, showed that 35% of those patients had visited &quot;itako&quot; to take part in a &quot;kuchiyose&quot; ritual.

===&quot;Mizuko kuyō&quot;===
 is a ceremony performed for mothers who have lost their children in childbirth or through abortions. The ritual, Buddhist in nature, gives the unborn or stillborn child a name, and then calls upon the protection of the spirit Jizo. The ceremony is considered by many to be a scam preying on grieving mothers, owing to its relatively recent origins in the 1960s. Others, however, see the practice as addressing a spiritual need created by Japan&#x27;s legalization of abortion in 1948.

===New Year Ebisu===
&quot;Itako&quot; must learn a chant known as the , a celebration of the New Year delivered in travels at the start of Spring. The chant mixes Buddhist references (such as peacocks) and aspects of the Japanese national anthem. Scholars suggest the language reveals the chant is derived from songs associated with the &quot;hinin&quot;.

===&quot;Kamioroshi&quot;===
The ritual is a musical performance dedicated to Oshirasama, a god of family. This ritual includes the performance of a song describing a horse who falls in love with a young human girl and is flayed alive; the girl falls ill, but is cured when the horse descends from heaven and flies her to India. The story is told through a dance including sticks with the heads of a horse and human girl on each side. This dance is known as the Ebisu Mai, or the &quot;God of wealth dance,&quot; and it is said that the dolls become possessed by kami spirits during the performance.

===Musical performance===
&quot;Itako&quot; are associated with the , a plucked instrument with ties to summoning the dead. The necromantic ritual of plucked instruments is found in the earliest document of Japan&#x27;s history, the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, which describes a koto&#x27;s sound in conjunction with the possession of a medium and the channeling of the dead. Another poem describes the sound of the instrument as a reflection of his wife&#x27;s spirit possessing the instrument. The &quot;biwa hoshi&quot;, itinerant blind priests, have a similar history with the instrument.

The chant which opens the &quot;kamioroshi&quot; ceremony makes several references to the plucked bow. The chant announces that the first pluck of the string calls down the gods of the village, the second calls down the gods of the prefecture, and the third calls the gods of all prefectures in Japan. Additional notes summon more powerful gods, responsible for ever-increasing spans of land and spiritual realms. These gods are sent away in reverse order at the end of the ceremony.

==Training==
Women usually enter &quot;itako&quot; training at a young age, prior to menstruation, at the encouragement of her parents. Before the introduction of special education programs in Japan, this was a choice made by the family to assure that a blind daughter could contribute to the household. Adopting the role of a medium was seen as an acceptable means for blind women to contribute to their local village and household, and avoid becoming a financial burden to their families.

Training for &quot;itako&quot; was often paid for with contributions from villagers, rather than the family. Common aspects of initiation practices for these women were seen among those training in Yamagata, Aomori, and Miyagi prefectures in the 1920s and 1930s. They are trained in various practices, including memorization of Shinto and Buddhist prayers and sutras. Training typically involved cold-water , which in its most extreme form can involve complete, sustained drenching by ice-cold water for a period of several days. These rituals are observed by the community, which prays for a fast resolution through the early arrival of a marrying deity.

Apprenticeship typically lasts three years, and involves heavy rote memorization and feats of physical purification. During this time, the &quot;itako&quot;-in-training is essentially adopted by a practicing shaman, and performs household work for the family.

===Initiation ceremony===
Ahead of the initiation ceremony, &quot;itako&quot; dress in a white kimono for several days, similar to a burial gown. She is not permitted to consume grain, salt, or meat, and must avoid artificial heat for three weeks before the ceremony. The lead-up to the ceremony had been described as incorporating &quot;sleeplessness, semi-starvation and intense cold.&quot;

This process usually leads to a loss of consciousness, which is described as the moment in which Fudo Myoo, or Nittensama, or some other deity, has taken possession of the &quot;itako&quot;&#x27;s body. In some cases, the &quot;itako&quot; must collapse while naming the spirit. In other cases, the names of various deities are written and scattered, while the &quot;itako&quot; sweeps over them with a brush until one of them is caught, which denotes the name of the possessing spirit.

At this point, a wedding ceremony, &quot;kamizukeshiki&quot;, is performed as an initiation. The &quot;itako&quot; trainee is dressed in a red wedding dress, and red rice and fish are consumed to celebrate her marriage to the spirit. It is suggested that the ceremony signals the death of the &quot;itako&quot;&#x27;s life as a burden and her rebirth as a contributing member of the community.

==Contemporary &quot;itako&quot;==

In contemporary Japan, &quot;itako&quot; are on the decline. In 2009, less than 20 remained, all over the age of 40. &quot;Itako&quot; are increasingly viewed with skepticism and disdain, and contemporary education standards have all but eradicated the need for specialized training for the blind.

An annual festival is held on Mt. Osore beside the Entsuji Buddhist temple, which hangs signs disavowing any connection to the &quot;itako&quot;. The festival is held July 20–24, coinciding with the Obon holiday, which is the traditional day on which spirits of the dead return. They also attend the summer festival at Kawakura Sainokawara. Despite the disavowal of many religious organizations and temples in Japan, both events have become tourist attractions that attract crowds of hundreds. The local government includes the image of an &quot;itako&quot; in its tourist brochures, and attempted to fund a permanent &quot;itako&quot; position in the nearby temple to encourage sustained tourism throughout the year.

&quot;Itako&quot;, though few in number, have formed an association, the &quot;itako-ko&quot; and do occasionally work with Buddhist temples, usually providing support for funerals.

<doc id="328398" wikidata="Q840608" url="?curid=328398" title="Moriya, Ibaraki">
<text>is a city located in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 69,827 in 29,056 households and a population density of 1955 persons per km². The percentage of the population aged over 65 was 23.1%. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Moriya is located in southwestern Ibaraki Prefecture, bordering on Chiba Prefecture to the southwest. The city is surrounded by three rivers, the Kinugawa, Kokaigawa and the Tone River, one of the longest rivers in Japan. In terms of area, it is the smallest city in Ibaraki Prefecture. It is located approximately 35 kilometers from central Tokyo.

===Surrounding municipalities===
Chiba Prefecture
*Kashiwa
* Noda
Ibaraki Prefecture
* Jōsō
* Toride
* Tsukubamirai

===Climate===
Moriya has a Humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light snowfall. The average annual temperature in Moriya is 14.4 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1325 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.3 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.5 °C.

===Topography===
With an area of 35.63 km2, the city has the smallest land area in the prefecture. The city is shaped like a circle, 7.5 km east to west and 7.2 km north to south, and most of the city area belongs to the Jōsō, a plateau with an average elevation of 20 m above sea level. Although residential land development is underway throughout the city, there are still many natural features such as fields of ore soil mainly on the plateau and alluvial rice paddies mainly along the Tone River.

====City location (World Geodetic System)====
*East end: 140 degrees 01 minutes 21 seconds east longitude (Honmachi)
*West end: East longitude 139 degrees 55 minutes 54 seconds (Oki)
*South end: 35 degrees 54 minutes 35 seconds north latitude (Takano)
*North end: 35 degrees 58 minutes 44 seconds north latitude (Itatoi)

===Rivers===
The Kokai River flows northeast of the city, the Kinugawa River west of the city, and the Tone River south of the city, which used to be a cove. Although the city and most of the city area were located on a plateau, flood damage was often observed in the low-lying areas because the city was surrounded by rivers on three sides. However, the danger has gradually decreased since the Meiji Era (1868-1912) with the construction of levees and regulating reservoirs, as well as the relocation of houses within the regulating areas. Large-scale flooding did not occur until around 1982, and the inundation itself was over by 1985. Today, only a few areas are considered potentially inundated due to flooding and improvement of inundated areas. In addition, since the area was surrounded by rivers, it benefited from the river boat transportation developed since the Edo period, and became a relay point from the lower reaches of the Tone River, such as Choushi, to Sekiyado and the Edogawa River area, and a concentration point for products from the northern Kanto region via the Kinugawa River.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Moriya has grown rapidly since the 1970s.

==History==
Moriya developed in the Kamakura period as a castle town ruled by the Sōma clan, who ruled northern Shimōsa Province. During the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, much of the area was ruled as part of Sakura Domain, followed by Sekiyado Domain. The town of Moriya was established within Kitasōma District on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was elevated to city status February 2, 2002.

==Government==
Moriya has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 20 members. Moriya contributes one member to the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Ibaraki 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Moriya was an agricultural area until the late 1970s, when the development of new towns and industrial parks made it a commuter town and suburb of greater Tokyo.

==Education==
Moriya has nine public elementary schools and four public middle schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Ibaraki Prefectural Board of Education. There are also one private elementary school and three private high schools.

<text>Aqaba ( , ; , ) is the only coastal city in Jordan and the largest and most populous city on the Gulf of Aqaba. Situated in southernmost Jordan, Aqaba is the administrative center of the Aqaba Governorate. The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of . Today, Aqaba plays a major role in the development of the Jordanian economy, through the vibrant trade and tourism sectors. The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region.

Aqaba&#x27;s strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and Africa has made its port important throughout thousands of years. The ancient city was called &quot;Elath&quot;, adopted in Latin as &quot;Aela&quot; and in Arabic as &quot;Ayla&quot;. Its strategic location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the Chalcolithic period. Aela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic conquest around AD 650, when it became known as &quot;Ayla&quot;; the name &quot;Aqaba&quot; is late medieval. The Great Arab Revolt&#x27;s Battle of Aqaba resulted in victory for Arab forces over the Ottoman defenders.

Aqaba&#x27;s location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has placed it in Jordan&#x27;s golden triangle of tourism, which strengthened the city&#x27;s location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country&#x27;s only seaport. The city sits right across the border from Eilat, likewise Israel&#x27;s only port on the Red Sea. After the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, there were plans and hopes of establishing a trans-border tourism and economic area, but few of those plans have come to fruition.

==Name==
The name of the city was anciently &quot;Elath&quot;, &quot;Ailath&quot;. The name is presumably derived from the Semitic name of a tree in the genus &quot;Pistacia&quot;. Modern Eilat (established 1947), situated about 5 km north-west of Aqaba, also takes its name from the ancient settlement. In the Hellenistic period, it was renamed Berenice (in Greek Βερενίκη), but the original name survived, and under Roman rule was re-introduced in the forms Aila, &quot;Aela&quot; or &quot;Haila&quot;, adopted in Byzantine Greek as Άιλα &quot;Aila&quot; and in Arabic as &quot;Ayla&quot; (آيلا). The crusaders called the city Elyn.

The present name &quot;al-ʿAqaba&quot; () is a shortened from &quot;ʿaqabat Aylah&quot; () &quot;the mountain-pass of Ayla&quot;, first mentioned in the 12th century by Idrisi, at a time when the settlement had been mostly reduced to a military stronghold, properly referring to the pass just to the north-east of the settlement (, now traversed by Aqaba Highway).

==History==
===Nearby Chalcolithic sites===
Excavations at two tells (archaeological mounds) Tall Hujayrat Al-Ghuzlan and Tall Al-Magass, both a few kilometres north of modern-day Aqaba city, revealed inhabited settlements from c. 4000 BC during the Chalcolithic period, with thriving copper production on a large scale. This period is largely unknown due to the absence of written historical sources. University of Jordan 
archaeologists have discovered the sites, where they found a small building whose walls were inscribed with human and animal drawings, suggesting that the building was used as a religious site. The people who inhabited the site had developed an extensive water system in irrigating their crops which were mostly made up of grapes, olives and wheat. Several different-sized clay pots were also found suggesting that copper production was a major industry in the region, the pots being used in melting the copper and reshaping it. Scientific studies performed on-site revealed that it had undergone two earthquakes, with the latter one leaving the site completely destroyed.

===Early history===
====Elath====

The Edomites, who ruled over Edom just south of the Dead Sea, are believed to have built the first port in Aqaba called Elath around 1500 BC, turning it into a major hub for the trade of copper as the Phoenicians helped them develop their maritime economy. They profited from its strategic location at the junction of trading routes between Asia and Africa.

====Tell el-Kheleifeh====
Archaeologists have investigated an Iron Age settlement at Tell el-Kheleifeh, immediately west of Aqaba, inhabited between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE.

====Undefined====
Around 735 BC, the city was conquered by the Assyrian empire. Because of the wars the Assyrians were fighting in the east, their trading routes were diverted to the city and the port witnessed relative prosperity. The Babylonians conquered it in 600 BC. During this time, Elath witnessed great economic growth, which is attributed to the business background of its rulers who realized how important the city&#x27;s location was. The Persian Achaemenid Empire took the city in 539 BC.

===Classical antiquity===
====Hellenistic period====
The city continued to grow and prosper which made it a major trading hub by the time of the Greek rule by 300 BC, after the Wars of Alexander the Great, it was described by a Greek historian to be &quot;one of the most important trading cities in the Arab World&quot;. The Ptolemaic Greeks called it &quot;Berenice&quot;.

The Nabatean kingdom had its capital north of the city, at Petra.

====Roman period====
In 64 BC, following the Roman conquest, they annexed the city and called it &quot;Aela&quot; (also &quot;Haila&quot;, &quot;Aelana&quot;, in Greek rendered Αἴλα &quot;Aila&quot;).

Both Petra and Aela were under strong Nabatean influence despite the Roman rule. Aela reached its peak during Roman times, the great long-distance road the Via Traiana Nova led south from Bostra through Amman, terminating in Aela, where it connected with a west road leading to the Paralia and Roman Egypt.

Around AD 106 Aela was one of the main ports for the Romans.

====Late Roman and Byzantine periods====

The Aqaba Church was constructed under Roman rule between 293 and 303 and is considered to be the oldest known purpose-built Christian church in the world. By the time of Eusebius, Aela became the garrison of the Legio X Fretensis, which was moved to Aela from Jerusalem.
One of the oldest known texts written in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription found in Jabal Ram east of Aqaba.

The city became a Christian bishopric at an early stage. Its bishop Peter was present at the First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council, in 325. Beryllus was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Paul at the synod called by Patriarch Peter of Jerusalem in 536 against Patriarch Anthimus I of Alexandria, a council attended by bishops of the Late Roman provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda and Palaestina Tertia, to the last-named of which Aela belonged.

A citadel was also built in the area that became the focal point of the Roman southern defense system.

In the 6th century, Procopius of Caesarea mentioned a Jewish population in Eilat and its surroundings which enjoyed autonomy until the time of Justinian I ().

According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad himself reached Aila during the expedition of Tabuk of 630, and extracted tribute from the city.

During the Late Byzantine or even Early Muslim period, Aila was the origin of what came to be known as the Ayla-Axum amphoras.

===Early Muslim period===
Aila fell to the Islamic armies by 629, and the ancient settlement was left to decay, while a new Arab city was established outside its walls under Uthman ibn Affan, known as &quot;Ayla&quot; ().

The Early Muslim city was excavated in 1986 by a team from the University of Chicago. Artefacts are now on exhibit at Aqaba Archaeological Museum and Jordan Archaeological Museum in Amman. The fortified city was inscribed in a rectangle of 170 × 145 meters, with walls 2.6 meters thick and 4.5 meters high, surrounding a fortified structure, occupying an area of 35 × 55 meters. 24 towers defended the city. The city had four gates on all four sides, defining two main lines intersecting at the centre. The intersection of these two thoroughfares was indicated by a tetrapylon (a four-way arch), which was later transformed into a luxury residential building decorated with frescoes dated to the tenth century. This type of urban structure, called MSIR, is typical of early Islamic fortified settlements.

The city prospered from 661 to 750 under the Umayyads and beyond under the Abbasids (750–970) and the Fatimids (970–1116). Ayla took advantage of its key position as an important step on the road to India and Arab spices (frankincense, myrrh), between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Peninsula. The city is also mentioned in several stories of the Arabian Nights.

The geographer Shams Eddin Muqaddasi describes Ayla as nearby the ruined ancient city.

The city was mentioned in Medieval Arabic sources as having a mixed population of Jews and Christians. It subsequently became an important station for pilgrim caravans on the way to Mecca.

===Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
Baldwin I of Jerusalem took over the city in 1115 without encountering much resistance. The centre of the city then moved to 500 meters along the coast to the south, and the crusader fortress of &quot;Elyn&quot; was built, which allowed the Kingdom of Jerusalem to dominate all roads between Damascus, Egypt, and Arabia, protecting the Crusader states from the east and allowing for profitable raids on trade caravans passing through the area. In order to secure this strategic position, Baldwin also built and garrisoned a fortress on Pharaoh&#x27;s Island (called &quot;Île de Graye&quot; by the Franks), the modern &quot;Jazīrat Fir&#x27;aun&quot; in Egyptian territorial waters about west of Aqaba.

The garrison of Elyn (now serving primarily as a military outpost) was further strengthened in 1142 by Pagan the Butler, Lord of Oultrejourdain, who pursued an ambitious program of castle building throughout his domain. However, there was no large-scale settlement of Europeans in the area, and the region between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba remained mainly inhabited by Bedouins, who were obliged to pay tribute to the Lordship of Oultrejourdain. Despite all efforts to fortify the region, the city was captured in 1170 by a squadron sent by Saladin as he was besieging Gaza; while it was successfully raided by Raynald of Châtillon in 1182, it was never retaken by the Crusaders.

The old fort was rebuilt, as Aqaba Fortress, by Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh Al-Ghuri in the early 16th century. For the next four centuries, the site was a simple fishing village of little importance.

===Modern history===
During World War I, the Ottoman forces were forced to withdraw from Aqaba in 1917 after the Battle of Aqaba, led by T. E. Lawrence and the Arab forces of Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Nasir. The capture of Aqaba allowed the British to supply the Arab forces. In 1918, the regions of Aqaba and Ma&#x27;an were officially incorporated into the Kingdom of the Hejaz. In 1925, Ibn Saud the ruler of Nejd with the help of his Wahhabi Ikhwan troops successfully annexed the Hejaz, but gave up the Ma&#x27;an and Aqaba to the British protectorate of Transjordan.
The Jordanian census of 1961 found 8,908 inhabitants in &#x27;Aqaba.

In 1965, King Hussein, through an exchange deal with Saudi Arabia, gave of desert land in Jordanian territories in exchange for other territories, including of an extension of prime coastline south of Aqaba, which included the magnificent Yamanieh coral reef. Aqaba was a major site for imports of Iraqi goods in the 1980s until the Persian Gulf War.

In 1997, the Aqaba Marine Reserve was established within the southern boundaries of the Gulf of Aqaba.

==Geography==
The city lies at Jordan&#x27;s southernmost point, on the Gulf of Aqaba lying at the tip of the Red Sea. Its strategic location is shown in the fact that it is located at the crossroads of the continents of Asia and Africa, while bordering Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

===Climate===
Aqaba has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) with mild, sometimes warm winters and very hot dry summers. Subzero temperatures can be observed every few years. The record low temperature of was on January 16, 2008, as in Eilat.
==Local government==
In August 2000, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) was established which acted as the statutory institution empowered with administrative, fiscal, regulatory and economic responsibilities.

===Administrative divisions===
Jordan is divided into 12 administrative divisions, each called a Governorate. Aqaba Governorate divides into 3 Districts, some of which are divided into Subdistricts and further divided into villages.

==Economy==


Benefiting from its location and status as Jordan&#x27;s special economic zone, Aqaba&#x27;s economy is based on the tourism and port industry sectors. The economic growth in Aqaba is higher than the average economic growth in the country. Under the special economic zone status some investments and trades are exempted from taxation, as a result, new resorts, housing developments, and retail outlets are being constructed. New projects such as Tala Bay and Saraya al Aqaba are constructed aiming at providing high-end vacation and residential homes to locals and foreigners alike.

Aqaba&#x27;s location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has placed it in Jordan&#x27;s golden triangle of tourism, which strengthened the city&#x27;s location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country&#x27;s only seaport.

Over US$20 billion have been invested in Aqaba since 2001 when the Special Economic Zone was established. Along with tourism projects, Aqaba has also attracted global logistic companies such as APM Terminals and Agility to invest in logistics, which boosted the city&#x27;s status as a transport and logistics hub. There are numerous hotels that reside in Aqaba but new hotels are also under construction.

Aqaba is the only seaport of Jordan so virtually all of Jordan&#x27;s exports depart from here. Heavy machinery industry is also flourishing in the city with regional assembly plants being located in Aqaba such as the Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant. 
By 2008 the ASEZ had attracted $18bn in committed investments, beating its $6bn target by 2020 by a third and more in less than a decade. The goal was adjusted to bring in another $12bn by 2020, but in 2009 alone, deals worth $14bn were inked. Some projects currently under construction are:

* Marsa Zayed a $10 billion is the largest mega mixed-use development project ever envisioned in both Jordan and the region. Marsa Zayed will host facilities including residential neighborhoods, commercial outlets and amenities, entertainment venues, financial and business facilities, and a number of hotels. Additionally, the property will feature marinas and a cruise ship terminal. Marsa Zayed will encompass 6.4 million square meters of built-up property. 
*Saraya Aqaba, a $1.5 billion resort with a man made lagoon, luxury hotels, villas, and townhouses that will be completed by 2017.
* Ayla Oasis, a $1.5 billion resort around a man made lagoon with hotels, villas, an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman. It also has an Arabian Venice theme with apartment buildings built along canals only accessible by walkway or boat. This project will be completed by 2017.
*Tala Bay, Tala Bay was developed in a distinctive architectural style that blends Jordanian and regional architecture with total cost of US$680 million. Another distinguishing feature of this single community resort is its two-kilometer private sandy beach on the Red Sea.
*The Red Sea Astrarium (TRSA), the world&#x27;s only Star Trek themed park, worth $1.5 billion would have been completed by 2014 but cancelled in 2015. 
*Port relocation. Aqaba&#x27;s current port will be relocated to the southernmost part of the province near the Saudi border. Its capacity will surpass that of the current port. The project costs $5 billion, and it will be completed by 2013.
*Aqaba will be connected by the national rail system which will be completed by 2013. The rail project will connect Aqaba with all Jordan&#x27;s main cities and economic centers and several countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria.
*The Aqaba Container Terminal (ACT) handled a record 587,530 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2008, an increase of 41.6% on the previous year. To accommodate the rise in trade on the back of the increasing popularity of container shipping and the stabilising political situation in Iraq, the Aqaba Development Corporation (ADC) has announced plans for a new port. The port relocation to the south will cost an estimated $600m and will improve infrastructure, while freeing up space for development in the city. Plans for upgrading the King Hussein International Airport (KHIA) and the development of a logistics centre will also help position Aqaba as a regional hub for trade and transport.

===Tourism===

Aqaba has a number of luxury hotels, including in the Tala Bay resort 20 km further to the south, which service those who come for fun on the beaches as well as Scuba diving. Aqaba offers more than thirty primary diving locations, with the majority of them accommodating divers of all skill levels. These diving sites comprise fringing reefs that extend for over 25 kilometers, reaching all the way to the border with Saudi Arabia.

It also offers activities which take advantage of its desert location. Its many coffee shops offer mansaf and knafeh, and baqlawa desserts. Another very popular venue is the Turkish Bath (Hamam) built in 306 AD, in which locals and visitors alike come to relax after a hot day.
In 2006, the Tourism Division of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) reported that the number of tourists visiting the Zone in 2006 rose to about 432,000, an increase of 5% over previous year. Approximately 65%, or 293,000 were Jordanians. Of foreign tourists, Europeans visited the Zone in the largest numbers, with about 98,000 visiting during the year. The division has financed tourism advertising and media campaigns with the assistance of the European Union.

Aqaba has been chosen for the site of a new waterfront building project that would rebuild Aqaba with new man-made water structures, new high-rise residential and office buildings, and more tourist services to place Aqaba on the investment map and challenge other centers of waterfront development throughout the region.

Aqaba was chosen as the Arab Tourism City of 2011.

During the 5-day holiday at both the end of Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha, Jordanian and western expats flock into the city with numbers reaching up to 50,000 visitors. During this time the occupancy rate of most hotels there reaches as high as 90%, and are often fully booked.

The several development projects (i.e. Ayla, Saraya etc.) now taking place in Aqaba provide &quot;opportunities of empowerment&quot; for local populations that want to expand their agency within the city. According to Fulbright scholar Kimberly Cavanagh development projects will help exhibit the ways global- local partnerships and the resultant cultural exchanges,  can result in mutually beneficial outcomes.

==Demographics==
The city of Aqaba has one of the highest population growth rates in Jordan in 2011, and only 44% of the buildings in the city had been built before 1990. A special census for Aqaba city was carried by the Jordanian department of statistics in 2007, the total population of Aqaba by the census of 2007 was 98,400. The 2011 population estimate is 136,200. The results of the census compared to the national level are indicated as follows:
===Religion===

ِIslam represents the majority of the population of Aqaba, but Christianity still exists today. Approximately 5,000 Christian families live in the city. There are several churches in the city and multiple Christian schools including &quot;Rosary Sisters School Aqaba&quot;.

==Cityscape==

Residential buildings in Aqaba are made up of 4 stories, of which are covered with sandstone or limestone. The city has no high-rises; however, Marsa Zayed project is planned to dramatically change that reality through the construction of several high-rise towers that host hotels, residential units, offices and clinics.

==Culture==

===Museums===
The largest museum in Aqaba is the Aqaba Archaeological Museum.

===Lifestyle===
Aqaba has recently experienced a great growth in its nightlife, especially during the dramatic increase of tourist number in the 2000s.

===Cuisine===

The fact that the city is the only coastal city in Jordan has created a distinctive cuisine relative to other Jordanian cities. Main dishes include Sayadeyah, a combination of rice, fish and spices, a dish common among Arab coastal cities. Kishnah is fish, tomatoes and onions cooked together. Bukhari is made up of rice, meat, hummus beans, ghee and spices popular with wedding ceremonies. Aqabawi desserts include Al-Hooh, which consists of layers of pastry stuffed with nuts or dates that are then fried in ghee and dipped in sugar syrup. Dates and ghee, consisting of fresh dates dipped in ghee, is a simple dessert also commonly presented to guests.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===
The Aqaba railway system ceased operations in 2018. If and when an Israeli railway to Eilat is built, it might either be extended across the border to Jordan or enable passengers traveling from Gush Dan to Aqaba to cross the border via road transport.

===Airports===
King Hussein International Airport is the only civilian airport outside of Amman in the country, located to the north of Aqaba. It is a 20-minutes drive away from the city center. Regular flights are scheduled from Amman to Aqaba with an average flying time of 45 minutes which is serviced by Royal Jordanian Airlines and Jordan Aviation Airlines. Several international airlines connect the city to Istanbul, Dubai, Alexandria, Sharm el-Sheikh, and other destinations in Asia and Europe. Since the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, there were plans to jointly develop airport infrastructure in the region. However, when Israel built Ramon Airport only 10 km distant from King Hussein International Airport, this happened without consulting the Jordanian side, which caused a slight deterioration of bilateral relations between the two countries and concerns over the safety of having two airports so close together.

===Roads===

Aqaba is connected by an modern highway system to surrounding countries. The city is connected to the rest of Jordan by the Desert Highway and the King&#x27;s Highway that provides access to the resorts and settlements on the Dead Sea. Aqaba is connected to Eilat in Israel by taxi and bus services passing through the Wadi Araba crossing. And to Haql in Saudi Arabia by the Durra Border Crossing. There are many bus services between Aqaba and Amman and the other major cities in Jordan, JETT and Trust International are the most common lines. These tourist buses are spacious and installed with air conditioning and bathrooms.

===Port===
The Port of Aqaba is the only port in Jordan. Regular ferry routes to Taba are available on a daily basis and are operated by several companies such as Sindbad for Marine Transportation and Arab Bridge Maritime. The routes serve mainly the Egyptian coastal cities on the gulf like Taba and Sharm Al Sheikh. In 2006, the port was ranked as being the &quot;Best Container Terminal&quot; in the Middle East by &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot;. The port was chosen for its recent improvements and its ability to handle local traffic as well as international traffic to four neighboring countries.

==Wildlife==
The Gulf of Aqaba is rich with marine life. The gulf is home to approximately 500 fish species, with many being permanent residents, like lion fish and octopus, while others are migratory, typically appearing during the summer, such as sailfish, considered the fastest fish in the ocean, as well as the world&#x27;s largest fish, the whale shark. Marine mammals and reptiles also inhabit the gulf during summer, hawksbill sea turtles, and bottle nosed dolphins call Aqaba&#x27;s gulf home as well. A large number of predatory shark species used to inhabit Aqaba&#x27;s gulf but, due to overfishing and pollution, this population is in decline. While mostly deep water sharks such as the tiger sharks and thresher sharks are present, there are also a small number of reef sharks as well. The world&#x27;s fastest shark, the short-fin mako shark is the most commonly caught species by fishermen in Aqaba. Whale sharks, locally known as Battan, are the most commonly sighted. Conservationists are working hard to protect Aqaba&#x27;s shark population.

Divers commonly stumble upon yellow-mouthed moray eels, blue spotted stingrays, eagle rays, Napoleon wrasse, frogfish, groupers, barracuda, clownfish and many other colourful and exotic species.

The gulf of Aqaba hosts more than 390 bird species including migratory birds such as the greater flamingo, great white pelican and the pink-backed pelican.

<text>Aqabah (, and also called Al Aqabah, Aqaba, or Al Aqaba) is a Palestinian village in the northeastern West Bank, which is being targeted for demolition by the Israeli Civil Administration (the IDF agency responsible for controlling the West Bank) as the majority of structures were alleged to have been built without permits from the Israeli military administration. Surrounded by two Israeli military bases and a ‘virtual wall’ of checkpoints, Al-Aqaba&#x27;s connections to neighboring communities, markets and the Jordan Valley have been gradually severed: since 1967, al-Aqaba&#x27;s population has decreased by 85%, dropping from around 2,000 to less than 200 today. While many al-Aqaba residents no longer live in the village itself, they still hope to return to their land, and still send their children to the local school.

Located in Area C of the West Bank on the edge of the Jordan Valley, the village is under complete Israeli military control and civil jurisdiction.

The Israeli Civil Administration has so far issued 39 Demolition Orders against the houses and structures of the village, including the medical center, an internationally funded kindergarten, the houses, and the village mosque.

A petition to the Israeli Supreme Court asking the court to cancel the demolition orders on the basis of an existing land-use plan was rejected on April 17, 2008.

The villagers, led by Mayor Haj Sami Sadeq, have initiated a local and international campaign, in cooperation with several Israeli and American human rights organizations, to save the village. The campaign has included taking Israelis and foreign diplomats to visit Aqabah, lobbying the Quartet and asking for its intervention, and conducting a US speaking tour with the participation of Mayor Sadeq and prominent Israeli architect Shmuel Groag.

The goal of the campaign is to encourage the Israeli authorities to authorize the land-use plans and allow the village to stand.

==History==

===Byzantine period===
Aqabah is mentioned in the 6th-7th century Mosaic of Reḥob inscription under the name ’Iqabin (איקבין), being a place inhabited mostly by non-Jews and, therefore, agricultural produce obtained from the area could be taken by Jews without the normal restrictions imposed during the Sabbatical years, or the need for tithing.

===Israeli occupation (1967- )===
After the 1967 Six-Day War, for 36 years, Aqabah was the site of an Israeli military camp, and the area was declared as closed military zone, with only 4 pre-1967 stone houses regarded by the occupying power as &#x27;legal&#x27;. Another 70 houses built since without Israeli permits, which cannot be obtained in areas defined as military zones, are up for demolition. The IDF conducted live training exercises inside the village, causing the death of 8 villagers and wounding more than 50 residents.

Haj Sami Sadeq, Mayor of Aqabah, is one of the victims of those live training exercises, paralyzed for life after being shot by three bullets while working in his fields as a 16 year old.

In addition, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Israeli military also expropriated large areas of privately registered land.

On June 27, 2001, Aqabah won a legal battle in the Israeli High Court of Justice (HCJ) when the HCJ recommended the army remove its military camp from the village&#x27;s lands and find an alternate site.

Two years later, the Israeli military complied with the court&#x27;s order, and in June 2003 the military camp was finally removed from the village. Israel has refused to connect the village to a water grid, and supplies have to be purchased and trucked in. After his house was bulldozed in August 2015, Rashid Dabak commented, &quot;The problem with Israelis is that they suffer from a weak sense of humanism.&quot;

==Foreign investment and help==
Villagers rely primarily on agriculture and grazing for their livelihoods, with a combined livestock herd of around 800 animals. Recognizing that the residents of Aqabah own clear title to approximately 3,500 dunams of registered (&quot;Tabo&quot;) land, Israel&#x27;s allies, the United Nations, and several international organizations have invested heavily in the village: USAID helped build the road, the British government built the medical clinic, and the Japanese Embassy provided funds for a water tank.

In 2004, the American nonprofit organization, The Rebuilding Alliance, initiated the building of a large, modern kindergarten and lower-grade school. Aqabah was chosen as the site for the kindergarten because the town&#x27;s High Court victory against the IDF seemed to guarantee that the town was legally recognized by the Israeli government and would not be demolished.

In a joint project, the Japanese Embassy, the Belgian Embassy and the Norwegian Embassy helped add a second story to the kindergarten.

Being the only kindergarten in the whole area, the Aqabah kindergarten today serves more than 130 kindergarteners and 70 elementary school children in the region.

The UN Development Programme, CARE International, the Danish Embassy, and the Dutch have also invested resources in building and maintaining structures in the village.

==Threats and Acts of Demolition==
Located in Area C of the West Bank, Aqabah is subject to the Israeli Civil Administration&#x27;s zoning authority and regulations.

In 1998, the Village Council applied to the Israeli Civil Administration for a master plan which would enable the village to obtain permits for construction, but the Civil Administration has never replied to their request. As a result, Aqabah was left with no zoning plan except for the one made by the British in 1945, more than sixty years ago.

The left-wing Israeli organization Gush Shalom states that despite the population increase and changing needs of the village inhabitants, the Civil Administration ignored their needs and turned them into &quot;lawbreakers&quot; against their will.

According to Mayor Sadeq, 600 residents were forced to leave the village due to the Israeli expansion and annexation policies, and only 300 residents remain.

In 2003, the Israeli Civil Administration began issuing demolition orders against the village structures, claiming &quot;lack of building permits&quot; and ignoring the repeated attempts of the village at getting a land-use plan authorized.

Bulldozers sent by the Civil Administration arrived at the village and destroyed two homes. After the intervention of the American Consulate, the demolitions were halted. However, the Civil Administration continued issuing Demolition Orders to further its plan of demolishing the village and converting it into a &quot;closed military area.&quot;

Mayor Sadeq and Gush Shalom argue that Israel&#x27;s plan aims to annex 805 more dunams of the village&#x27;s lands and reshape the village in accordance with the Civil Administration&#x27;s plan. According to this plan, the army intends to demolish all of the houses that will be out of the village&#x27;s new border, and to move these families to the new boundaries of the village after it loses most of it lands.

If the Civil Administration&#x27;s plan is fully implemented and the army demolishes most of the houses, only six houses will remain inside the new border, and for all practical purposes, the village will be destroyed.

As of December 2008, 39 of the village structures - virtually the entire village - face demolition orders.

===High Court petition denied===
The village, with the help of Rebuilding Alliance, hired an Israeli attorney to petition the Israeli Supreme Court for a lifting of the Demolition Orders and for initiating a land-use plan that will answer the population&#x27;s needs.

The petition was filed in January 2004, and the court issued a Temporary Restraining Order staying further demolitions pending the outcome of the case.

On April 17, 2008, after four years of negotiations, the Supreme Court - sitting as a High Court of Justice (HCJ) - finally heard the case. None of the village residents was allowed to attend the hearing in the Supreme Court in Jerusalem.

In oral argument, Adv. Tusya-Cohen stated that it was the state&#x27;s duty to set up a team of experts, to draw up an up-to-date Master Plan, according to which building permits could have been issued - not to stick to a completely obsolete plan, decades out of date and completely unfitting the conditions on the ground, making his clients into &quot;law-breakers&quot; against their will.

On the same day of the hearing, the HCJ issued a 1-page decision denying the petitions and authorizing the demolitions of all the structures. Judges Edmond Levy, Miriam Naor and Yoram Danziger wrote:

As for the demolition orders themselves – Petitioners have no real cause for granting an order and receiving a remedy. Even if the planning authorities committed negligence by omission, and we do not say so, this does not give permission for chaotic building and setting facts on the ground that may become obstacles for any future planning. Moreover, cancelling the demolition orders – as the Petitioners request – would be tantamount to the Court authorizing the [building] offenses, and it is obvious that Petitioners cannot win such a remedy.
The judges concluded by authorizing the demolition of the entire village. They added, however, that they are &quot;acknowledging&quot; the Civil Administration&#x27;s proposal that would leave several public buildings standing but demolish most of the homes in the village.

===Response to High Court decision===

The residents of Aqabah, Mayor Haj Sami Sadeq and Israeli and American human rights organizations are determined to continue to fight to save the village.

In a letter of protest to Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Gush Shalom, the Israeli Peace Bloc, wrote:
The Rebuilding Alliance and Gush Shalom state that the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision is seriously flawed because it is based on grave misrepresentations and omission of facts. As documents from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs prove, in 1998 the Village Council filed a master plan.

Thus, the assertion that there is no master plan is factually wrong. Had the Civil Administration authorized it or addressed it in any manner, the villagers would have been able to obtain permits for construction. In addition, in 2006 the village commissioned another comprehensive land-use plan which was drawn by architect Jamal Juma but the Israeli Civil Administration ignored the plan.

In its decision, the Israeli High Court of Justice ignored the existence of these plans, falsely portraying the villagers as &quot;law-breakers&quot; and &quot;chaotic builders&quot; who have no respect for rule of law.

Moreover, in April 2008, the Israeli-NGO BIMKOM (Israeli Planners for Planning Rights) reviewed the village&#x27;s zoning plan to insure its conformity to Israeli standards. Architect Shmuel Groag, co-founder of BIMKOM and an expert in town planning, reviewed and edited the plan and recommended that it be authorized. In September 2008, while appearing before Congressmen on Capitol Hill, Mr. Groag stated:

Rebuilding Alliance founder Donna Baranski-Walker issued a press release noting that the village has never posed any security problem, and there is no justification for demolishing the houses. The demolition orders should be stayed until BIMKOM&#x27;s land-use plan is authorized.

This course of action follows a precedent that was set in the case of the Palestinian village Wallaje in southern Jerusalem which was also saved pending the authorization of a land-use plan. The families of Aqabah, the Mayor, BIMKOM and Gush Shalom have called for the implementation of a similar plan in the case of Aqabah, and urged the Israeli authorities to avoid the destruction of the village.

<text>Elath (; ; , Ἀηλά, Αἴλανα, Αἰλανίτης, Αἰλανή, Ἐλάνα, Αἴλανον, Αἰλάς, Αἰλάθ, Αἰλών, Ἡλάθ, Αϊλά), or Eloth, was an ancient city mentioned in several places in the Hebrew Bible on the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba. It was in the same vicinity as Ezion-Geber.

The name survived into the Roman period as &quot;Aela&quot;, adopted into Byzantine Greek as &quot;Aila&quot; and into Arabic as &quot;Aylah&quot; (the Arab settlement was built outside the ruins of the ancient city), later becoming Aqabat Aylah (&quot;Aylah Ascent&quot;), eventually shortened down to Aqaba.

The modern Israeli town of Eilat, established in 1951, is named for the ancient city.

==Name==
The name likely comes from the Hebrew root (), which is also the root for the word &quot;Elah&quot; (), meaning Pistacia tree. There may be an etymological relationship between &quot;ʾElat &quot;goddess and אלה terebinth. Like numerous other localities, Eilat is mentioned in the Bible both in singular (possibly construct state) and plural form (Eilot). Elath was an Israelite city that existed in the same general area. The original settlement was probably at the northern tip of the Gulf of Eilat. Ancient Egyptian records also document the extensive and lucrative mining operations and trade across the Red Sea with Egypt starting as early as the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt. Elath is mentioned in antiquity as a major trading partner with Elim, Thebes&#x27; Red Sea Port, as early as the Twelfth Dynasty. Trade between Elim and Elath furnished frankincense and myrrh, brought up from Ethiopia and Punt; bitumen and natron, from the Dead Sea; finely woven linen, from Byblos; and copper amulets, from Timna; all mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. In antiquity Elath bordered the states of Edom, Midian and the tribal territory of the Rephidim, the indigenous inhabitants of the Sinai Peninsula.

==Hebrew Bible==
Elath is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Exodus. The first six Stations of the Exodus are in Egypt. The seventh is Crossing the Red Sea and the 9th–13th are in and around Elath. Station twelve refers to a dozen campsites in and around Timna in the state of Israel near Eilat. 

When King David conquered Edom, which up to then had shared a common border with Midian, he took over Eilat, the border city shared by them as well. The commercial port city and copper based industrial center were maintained by Egypt until reportedly rebuilt by Solomon at a location known as Ezion-Geber (I Kings 9:26). In 2 Kings 14:21–22, many decades later, &quot;All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. He rebuilt Elath, and restored it to Judah, after his father&#x27;s death.&quot; Later, in 2 Kings 16:6, during the reign of King Ahaz: &quot;At that time the king of Edom recovered Elath for Edom, and drove out the people of Judah and sent Edomites to live there, as they do to this day.&quot;

According to the Bible (2 Kings 14:22), one of the earliest and most significant of King Uzziah&#x27;s achievements, unless it has to be attributed to his predecessor Amaziah, was the recovery of Elath, which was later lost by Ahaz - all three 8th-century BCE kings of Judah.

The same Uzziah regained for Judah that command of the trade route of the Red Sea which Solomon had held, but which has subsequently been lost.

<text>Delta is a city in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada, and part of Greater Vancouver. Located on the Fraser Lowland south of Fraser River&#x27;s south arm, it is bordered by the city of Richmond on the Lulu Island to the north, New Westminster to the northeast, Surrey to the east, the Boundary Bay and the American pene-exclave Point Roberts to the south, and the Strait of Georgia to the west.

Encompassing the nearby Annacis Island, Deas Island and Westham Island, Delta is mostly rural and officially composed of three distinct communities: North Delta, Ladner and Tsawwassen.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, Delta&#x27;s flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the Tsawwassen First Nation of the Coast Salish. The land was first sighted by Europeans in 1791, when Spanish explorer Lieutenant Francisco de Eliza mistook the area for an island and named it &quot;Isla de Cepeda&quot;. The first European settler in Delta was James Kennedy who pre-empted 135 acres in what later became Annieville in February 1860. Thomas and William Ladner, began farming the area named after them in 1868. Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over the next few decades. In 1879, the area was incorporated as a municipality, named &quot;the Corporation of Delta&quot;, and the village of Ladner was made as its administrative centre.

Due to its geography, Delta was a relatively isolated community. The completion of the George Massey Tunnel in 1959 linking Ladner to Richmond and Vancouver along with the opening, in 1960, of the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal and the Highway 99 being rerouted from the King George Highway in Surrey in 1962 to a new route through Delta, ended Delta&#x27;s isolation and resulted in a massive 400% population growth over the next 20 years. The 1986 completion of the Alex Fraser Bridge connecting North Delta to New Westminster and Vancouver also helped Delta&#x27;s growth.

On 22 September 2017, at the request of Delta&#x27;s council, the Government of British Columbia changed the name and classification of the Corporation of Delta to the City of Delta.

==Neighbourhoods==
Delta comprises three distinct, geographically separate communities:
*North Delta (pop: 51,623) is home to over half of Delta&#x27;s population. It is a largely suburban area in north-east Delta bordered by the Burns Bog and Surrey.
*Ladner (pop: 21,112) is a 19th-century fishing village in northwest Delta that has expanded into a suburb. Fishing and farming are important industries. Ladner Trunk Road is its main street.
*Tsawwassen (pop: 20,933) is a suburban community in the southwest Delta that calls itself the sunniest place in Metro Vancouver. Luxury waterfront homes line Tsawwassen&#x27;s coast. Tsawwassen is also home to the busy Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal which links the mainland to Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. Tsawwassen, together with Ladner are also known as South Delta.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Delta had a population of 108,455 living in 38,058 of its 39,736 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 102,238. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2011, the median age was 42.8 years old, which is slightly higher than the national median age of 40.6 years old. There were 35,781 private dwellings with an occupancy rate of 97.1%. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, the median value of a dwelling in Delta is $562,181 which is significantly higher than the national average of $280,552. The median household income (after taxes) in Delta is $71,590, quite higher than the national average at $54,089.

===Ethnicity===
As of 2021, Delta&#x27;s population is 108,455. About 45% of Delta&#x27;s population are visible minorities, of which there are approximately 28,000 South Asians, 9,700 Chinese people, and 3,700 Filipinos. There are also about 3,180 Indigenous peoples or 3% of the total population, some from Tsawwassen First Nation, who still hold a fraction of their former traditional territories; the Tsawwassen Lands at the mouth of the Fraser River, which is shared with the Hwlitsum First Nation from the Gulf Islands. Forming over one-quarter (26.1%) of the population, Delta has the fourth largest municipal South Asian population in British Columbia after neighbouring Vancouver, Surrey and Abbotsford.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Delta included:
*Irreligion (42,990 persons or 40.1%)
*Christianity (35,025 persons or 32.7%)
*Sikhism (19,235 persons or 17.9%)
*Hinduism (4,195 persons or 3.9%)
*Islam (3,265 persons or 3.0%)
*Buddhism (1,450 persons or 1.4%)
*Judaism (475 persons or 0.4%)
*Indigenous spirituality (20 persons or 0%)
==Geography==

Delta is located south of Vancouver and north of the Canada–US border at Peace Arch, Surrey. It is bordered by water on three sides: The Fraser River to the north, the Georgia Strait to the west and Boundary Bay to the south. At , Delta is the largest municipality in the GVRD; the second largest is its neighbour to the east, Surrey, at .

Delta&#x27;s flat, fertile land has made it one of the most important agricultural areas in Greater Vancouver. The Agricultural Land Reserve regulations preserve most of this land for agricultural use, preventing its conversion to suburban housing. North Delta is also home to the Burns Bog, of natural wetlands that are important for wildlife.

Delta includes Annacis Island, an industrial island reached via the Alex Fraser Bridge, which connects Delta with Richmond and New Westminster. Delta also includes a peninsula on the east side of the Fraser River at Delta&#x27;s northern city limits, which is only accessible via Surrey.

===Climate===
Delta is known for its relatively dry and sunny climate compared with other locations in Metro Vancouver. For example, it receives nearly 40% ( from 1981 to 2010) less precipitation than downtown Vancouver ( at Vancouver Harbour CS from 1971 to 2000) and just over half of that of North Vancouver ( at North Vancouver 2nd Narrows from 1981 to 2010). It has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with cooler summers and milder winters than other areas on the Canada–U.S. border, and features some of the mildest winters and lowest diurnal temperature variation in Canada.
==Government and politics==
Delta is governed by the Delta City Council, led by a Mayor and six Councillors, elected for four-year terms, and there is also an elected school board. The current mayor is George Harvie. Unlike most communities in Canada, but like Vancouver and Richmond, Delta has a system of locally based election slates such as TriDelta, IDEA, One Delta, Delta Residents Association, Delta Connect, DIVA, Independents Working For You, and Achieving For Delta.

In the House of Commons of Canada, Delta is part of the Delta electoral district. As of the 2021 Federal general election, Delta&#x27;s seat is held by Carla Qualtrough of the Liberal Party. In the 2024 provincial general election, the North Delta seat went to Ravi Kahlon of the British Columbia New Democratic Party while the South Delta seat went to Ian Paton of BC Conservative Party. 

Delta, unlike most Lower Mainland municipalities, has its own police department.

Former Delta mayor Lois Jackson served from 1999 to 2018 and since 1973 has had a seat on the Delta Council. Jackson was elected to council again in 2018.

==Power==
In Delta is BC Hydro&#x27;s Arnott Substation, the mainland terminal of the southern AC transmission connections providing power to Vancouver Island, and the former converter station for the HVDC Vancouver Island circuits.

==Transportation==
*Public transportation in Delta is a bus system provided by TransLink. There is no rapid transit system in Delta, though the SkyTrain system in Surrey comes within of the city&#x27;s borders.
*Delta is a major transportation hub for the Lower Mainland. Most vehicles leaving Vancouver for the United States pass through Delta&#x27;s borders. Many vehicles destined for Vancouver Island use the Tsawwassen ferry terminal in Delta.
*Highway 99 links Richmond to Delta via the George Massey Tunnel, built in 1959. North Delta is linked to New Westminster and Richmond by Highway 91 and the massive Alex Fraser Bridge (opened in 1986). Delta is linked to Surrey, Langley, and all points eastward by Highway 10. Traffic congestion during rush hour is quite common, although improvements are being made to Highway 91 interchanges at 72 Ave to remove a traffic light as well as the ramps from Nordel Way. 
*Highway 17 in Delta provides a connection to the Tsawwassen B.C. Ferry terminal, which provides car ferry connections to Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. In December 2013, north of the current junction with Deltaport Way, Highway 17 will be rerouted upon completion of the &quot;South Fraser Perimeter Road&quot;, and will primarily run parallel to River Road through Tilbury and North Delta to all points east. The remaining stretch of Highway 17 north of that point will be renamed Highway 17A.
*River Road is also another connector through the municipality. River Road starts in Surrey and heads westbound through North Delta, under the Alex Fraser Bridge, north of Burns Bog, and then terminates at 62B Street, which then turns into Highway 17A.
*Like River Road, the western communities of &quot;South Delta&quot; (Ladner and Tsawwassen) are linked to North Delta and communities to the east by Ladner Trunk Road; east of its crossover of Highway 91, the road becomes Highway 10.
*56th Street is another major artery in the community, bisecting the Tsawwassen region; it is the only road leading into the community of Point Roberts, south of the Canada–US border.
*Delta is also home to Boundary Bay Airport, Canada&#x27;s seventh busiest airport by aircraft movements. Boundary Bay Airport is primarily used for private aircraft, commercial charters, and flying lessons.

Utsunomiya gyoza is famous country-wide, so it attracts many tourists, as well as brings in a significant amount of revenue into the city.

Nikkō is a popular destination for Japanese and international tourists. Attractions include the mausoleum of &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Nikkō Tōshō-gū shrine, and that of his grandson Tokugawa Iemitsu (Iemitsu-byō Taiyū-in), along with Futarasan shrine, which dates to the year 767. There are many famous &quot;onsen&quot; (hot springs) in the area. Elevations range from 200 to 2,000 meters. 

The Japanese saying 「日光を見ずして結構と言うなかれ &quot;Never say &quot;kekkō&quot; until you&#x27;ve seen Nikkō&quot; – with &quot;kekkō&quot; meaning splendid, magnificent, or satisfied – is a reflection of the beauty and sites in Nikkō.

==Geography==

Nikkō covers a vast area (1,449.83 km2) of rural northwestern Tochigi, approximately 140 km north of Tokyo and 35 km west of Utsunomiya, the capital of Tochigi Prefecture. It is the third-largest city (by area) in Japan, behind Takayama and Hamamatsu.

Both the Watarase River and the Kinugawa River pass through the city. Lake Chūzenji and the Kegon Falls lie in Nikkō, as does the Nikko Botanical Garden. The city&#x27;s many mountains and waterfalls have made it an important source of hydroelectric power. The area has been used for mining copper, aluminum and concrete.

The weather in Nikkō is fairly similar to that of the northern island of Hokkaidō, even though Nikkō is much closer to Tokyo than Hokkaidō. The elevation of Nikkō plays an important role in this fact. It will usually get cooler as one ascends the mountain. The average temperature of Nikkō is around 7 °C (44 °F) with the warmest months reaching only about 22 °C (72 °F) and the coldest reaching down to about −8 °C (17 °F).

In March 2006, Nikkō absorbed the neighboring city of Imaichi, the town of Ashio from Kamitsuga District, the town of Fujihara, and the village of Kuriyama, both from Shioya District, to create what is officially the new and expanded city of Nikkō. The new city hall is located at the former Imaichi City Hall. The former Nikkō City Hall is now known as Nikkō City Hall-Nikkō Satellite Office.

<doc id="328425" wikidata="Q217234" url="?curid=328425" title="Ōta, Tokyo">
<text>is a special ward in the Tokyo Metropolis in Japan. The ward refers to itself in English as Ōta City. It was formed in 1947 as a merger of Ōmori and Kamata following Tokyo City&#x27;s transformation into Tokyo Metropolis. The southernmost of the 23 special wards, Ōta borders the special wards of Shinagawa, Meguro and Setagaya to the north, and Kōtō to the east. Across the Tama River in Kanagawa Prefecture is the city of Kawasaki, forming the boundaries to the south and west.

Ōta is the largest special ward in Tokyo by area, spanning 59.46 square kilometres (22.96 sq mi). As of 2024, the ward has an estimated population of 744,849, making it the third largest special ward by population, with a population density of 12,041 inhabitants per square kilometre (31,190/sq mi). 

Notable neighborhoods and districts of Ōta include Kamata, the administrative center of the ward where the Ward Office and central Post Office is located, and Den-en-chōfu(田園調布), known for its wealthy residents and luxury homes. Haneda Airport, the busiest airport in Japan by passenger traffic is located in the ward. 

==History==
The ward was founded on March 15, 1947, merging the old wards of Ōmori and Kamata. The ward&#x27;s name originates from the combination of letters of the two merging wards, Ōmori (大森) and Kamata (蒲田), combined into 大田 (Ōta). The ward was previously second behind Setagaya in terms of being the largest special ward in Tokyo by area, but due to land reclamation in the Tokyo Bay for the expansion of the Haneda Airport(羽田空港), Ōta overtook Setagaya for first place. 

Haneda Airport, now one of the two main domestic and international airports serving the Greater Tokyo Area (the other one being Narita Airport in Narita, Chiba) was first established as Haneda Airfield in 1931 in the town of Haneda, Ebara District of Tokyo Prefecture. Following Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, the airfield was turned into the Haneda Army Air Base under the control of the United States Army. In the same year, Allied occupational authorities ordered the expansion of the airport, evicting people from the surroundings on 48 hours&#x27; notice. With the end of the occupation, the Americans returned part of the facility to Japanese control in 1952, completing the return in 1958. Haneda Airport first handled international traffic for Tokyo for the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics. Following the opening of Narita Airport in 1978, almost all international flights (with the exception of Taiwanese airlines) moved its operations to Narita Airport. International flights resumed in 2010 following the construction of a new International terminal.

The company moved its operations there in 1985, using the funds generated from the successful Family Computer port of &quot;Xevious&quot; to fund the construction of its office. The building was taken over by Namco Bandai Games after it absorbed Namco in 2006, and later by an unrelated Namco company that focused on video arcades and theme parks. The newer Namco company moved out of the building in 2014 and it was demolished two years later.

Prior to the merger with Japan Airlines, Japan Air System had its headquarters at Haneda Airport in Ōta.

In 2000 All Nippon Airways was headquartered by Tokyo International Airport in Ōta. In 2002 Air Nippon was headquartered on the fifth floor of the at Haneda Airport in Ōta. The ANA subsidiary Air Nippon Network was also based at the airport.

Before its dissolution, Galaxy Airlines was headquartered in the ARC Building on the airport grounds.

Sega and its parent company Sega Sammy Holdings, best known for its &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise, was originally headquartered in Ōta. However, Sega Sammy Holdings announced in April 2017 that it would relocate its head office functions and domestic subsidiaries to Shinagawa-ku by January 2018. This was to consolidate scattered head office functions including Sega Sammy Holdings, Sammy Corporation, Sega Holdings, Sega Games, Atlus, Sammy Network, and Dartslive. After the relocation to Shinagawa was complete, Sega&#x27;s previous headquarters in Ōta was later sold in February 2019 and will likely be torn down.

Gakken was headquartered in Ōta from 1962 until 2008 when they moved their headquarters to Shinagawa.

===Festivals===
Shibukawa calls itself &quot;The Bellybutton of Japan&quot; (日本のおへそ) and hosts the Bellybutton Festival (へそ祭り) every year in late July. The festival is based on a traditional Japanese form of entertainment where revelers paint a face on their torsos and stomachs and pretend it is a head. A kimono is then wrapped around the waist and the person&#x27;s real head is hidden by a large cloth hat. The belly button is traditionally painted into a mouth. These days, modern motifs and Japanese anime designs have crept into the festival, which city officials said is all about having fun.

<doc id="328434" wikidata="Q1426212" url="?curid=328434" title="Flathead catfish">
<text>The flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), also called by several common names including mudcat or shovelhead cat, is a large species of North American freshwater catfish in the family Ictaluridae. It is the only species of the genus &quot;Pylodictis&quot;. Ranging from the lower Great Lakes region to northern Mexico, it has been widely introduced and is an invasive species in some areas. The closest living relative of the flathead catfish is the much smaller widemouth blindcat, &quot;Satan eurystomus&quot;, a cavefish.

==Common names==
The flathead catfish is also known as the yellow cat, mud cat, Johnnie cat, &quot;goujon&quot;, &quot;appaluchion&quot;, &quot;opelousas&quot;, pied cat and Mississippi cat. In dialect of the Ozark mountains it may be referred to as a &quot;granny cat.&quot;

==Description==
The flathead catfish is olive colored on its sides and dorsum, with a white to yellow underside. Individuals, particularly young specimens from clearer waters, may be strongly mottled with dark brown to black color. The eyes are small and the lower jaw prominently projects beneath the upper. A tooth pad has posterior extensions. The caudal fin is in structure, and its upper lobe may bear an isolated white margin. The fins are otherwise brown, though the body&#x27;s mottling may extend into the fins. The anal fin has 14 to 17 rays and a round margin.

The flathead catfish grows to a length of and may weigh up to , making it the second-largest North American catfish (after the blue catfish, &quot;Ictalurus furcatus&quot;). More commonly, adult length is about . Its maximum recorded lifespan is 28 years. Reproductive maturity is reached between 4 and 5 years, or at approximately . The world angling record flathead catfish was caught May 19, 1998, from Elk City Reservoir, Kansas, and weighed . However, a record from 1982, caught by &quot;other methods&quot;, shows that the flathead catfish could be North America&#x27;s longest species of catfish, after a specimen pulled from the Arkansas River measured and weighed .

==Distribution and habitat==
The native range of the flathead catfish includes a broad area west of the Appalachian Mountains encompassing large rivers of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio basins. The range extends as far north as Canada, as far west as Texas, and south to the Gulf of Mexico including northeastern Mexico.
The flathead catfish cannot live in full-strength seawater (which is about 35 parts per thousand or about 35 grams of salt per liter of water), but it can survive in 10 ppt for a while and thrive in up to about 5 ppt.

Flathead catfish are a benthic fish species meaning they are a fish which prefers to lay on the bottom of a body of water. These catfish prefer medium to large sized rivers with relatively warm water and stable slow moving currents. Flathead catfish prefer habitats with vertical banks, meaning the bank of land slightly overhangs the water and an area with fallen trees or woody debris. Specifically, these catfish prefer a woody debris depth of at least and a diameter of woody debris of at least to provide cover. Flathead catfish tend to have a home range of less than , this means that they are a non-migratory species of fish. 

==Diet==
The flathead catfish prefers live prey. It is a voracious carnivore and feeds primarily on fishes, insects, annelid worms, and crustaceans. It also feeds on other small catfish and almost anything that moves and makes vibration. They are known to eat crayfish, American gizzard shad (&quot;Dorosoma cepedianum&quot;), insects and larvae, channel catfish (&quot;Ictalurus punctatus&quot;), drum (&quot;Aplodinotus grunniens&quot;), other flatheads, green sunfish (&quot;Lepomis cyanellus&quot;), and carp. Insect larvae are the major prey type until an individual reaches approximately in total length, at which point the diet expands to include crayfish and small fishes. Individuals above in length feed almost exclusively on other fish.

At about the age of two years old, flathead catfish have a diet mainly consisting of crayfish; however, their use of crayfish slowly declines until about the age of six years old. When the catfish are around six years old, they completely cut crayfish out of their diet and they eat almost entirely a diet consisting of fish; this is called a piscivorous diet. Flathead catfish experience this diet change from the ages of two to six for one of two reasons, those being either a distribution to a habitat that doesn&#x27;t contain crayfish or a change in diet because of the increase in size of the catfish. The flathead catfish of six years or older that eat mainly fish have a seasonal diet shift, meaning they eat different kinds of fish depending on the time of year. Flathead catfish are a warm-water species; because of this the average consumption of juvenile flathead catfish increases with increasing temperature, and their average consumption decreases with decreasing temperatures. These catfish have a large increase in feeding at roughly and their appetite remains increased up to about . Their appetite starts to decrease at , most flatheads stop eating at , and no catfish ate any food at or below .

==Breeding==
Spawning of &quot;P. olivaris&quot; occurs in late June and early July, and the nests are made in areas with submerged logs and other debris. The males, which also build the nests, fiercely and tirelessly defend and fan the clutch. The size of the clutch varies proportionately to the size of the female; an average of 2,640 eggs per kilogram of fish are laid.

On average each female flathead lays a clutch of roughly 100,000 eggs. The role of the male catfish in fanning the clutch is to provide oxygen to the eggs through the use of his fins. The spawning of these catfish occurs when the temperature reaches roughly and the flow of the stream or river becomes steady. When flathead catfish reach the ages of three to six years old they are considered sexually mature and the catfish are able to start reproducing. As the current of the river or stream erodes away some of the river bed it creates natural depressions, these depressions tend to be where flathead catfish build their nests.

The fry frequent shallow areas with rocky and sandy substrates, where they feed on insects and worms such as annelids and polychaetes. Young flathead catfish are also cannibalistic, which has largely precluded their presence in aquaculture.

== Diel movement ==
Diel movement is the migration of an animal during a 24-hour period. Flathead catfish have a change in their diel movement depending on the season. In the spring and summer, flathead catfish have an increase in their movement activity from midnight to dawn, with their diel movement being the greatest in summer. By contrast, in the fall and winter, flathead catfish do not show any increased movement within a 24-hour time frame, with their diel movement being the smallest in the winter. Flathead catfish have a diel movement which is the largest in the summer time because of their spawning, which takes place from late spring to early summer, while in the winter they have the smallest diel movement because they are waiting for winter to end, which is called the overwintering phase.

<text>The Township of Langley is a district municipality immediately east of the City of Surrey in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. It extends south from the Fraser River to the Canada–United States border, and west of the City of Abbotsford. Langley Township is not to be confused with the City of Langley, which is adjacent to the township but politically is a separate entity. Langley is located in the eastern part of Metro Vancouver.

== History ==
=== First Nations ===
Throughout the last several millennia, the area that is now Langley Township was inhabited by various Stó꞉lō nations, including the Katzie and Kwantlen. There is limited recorded history from this time, as much was passed down through oral tradition rather than written documents. The Kwantlen were a major factor in the salmon trade that later operated out of the Fort Langley. Simon Fraser, while traveling through the Sto:lo territory in 1808 recorded the image of a Kwantlen village: Their houses are built of cedar planks and in shape, similar to the one already described, the whole range, which is six hundred and forty feet long by sixty broad, is under one roof, the front is eighteen feet high and the covering is slanting: all the apartments which are separated by partitions are square, except the Chief&#x27;s, which is ninety feet long. In this room the posts or pillars are nearly three feet in diameter at the base and diminish gradually to the top. In one of these posts is an oval opening answering the purpose of the door through which one man may crawl in or out. Above, on the outside, are carved human figures as large as life, with other figures in imitation of beasts and birds. 

=== Fort Langley (1827–1955) ===

The first Europeans to stay in the area permanently were the traders of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). In 1827, Fort Langley was built on the banks of the Fraser River, in the area now known as Derby Reach. It was one of a string of trading posts built along the Pacific Coast to compete with American fur traders for the rich pelts available in the region. Farming as well as cranberry and salmon exports soon replaced fur trading as the fort&#x27;s primary source of income.

The first fort (1827-1839), built with two bastions, a wooden stockade and several buildings, proved to have been built too close to a fast-moving part of the river, in an area prone to flooding. It was rebuilt in 1839 farther upstream. As the HBC&#x27;s network of forts in the interior grew, Fort Langley became a hub for farming, smithing and for shipping furs back to Europe. Along with farming, the export of cranberries and salmon would soon become the fort&#x27;s main source of profit.

In 1858, gold was discovered in the Fraser River in what is now the interior of British Columbia, and the fort also became important as a supply station for the miners heading up the river toward the gold fields. With thousands of gold prospectors, many of them American, streaming into the region, the British government created British Columbia as a colony. James Douglas was sworn in as the new colony&#x27;s first governor in Fort Langley, but New Westminster was chosen as the capital, as Fort Langley was less defensible from an American invasion.

When the gold rush ended, Fort Langley&#x27;s importance began to decline. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company subdivided and sold the farm it was occupying on Langley Prairie. Farming and logging took over as the dominant local industries.

In 1870, Paul Murray settled what is known today as Murrayville. Together with his sons he owned a quarter section of land on each of the four corners of Yale Road and what now is 216th Street. At that time, this area became known as &quot;Murrays corner&quot; after Alexander Murray, who drowned in the Fraser River in January 1884 while attempting in vain to save a friend. In 1925, the post office named it &quot;Murrayville&quot;. The area between 216 street, 216A street, 48th ave and 48A avenue is one of the oldest subdivisions in Langley. Of the eight building lots in this subdivision there are still 6 heritage houses (built before 1930).

The Township of Langley was incorporated on April 26, 1873, with James W. Mackie as its first elected warden. Over time, New Westminster and then Vancouver developed into urban centres, but Langley Township remained predominantly a rural community.

The growth of transportation continued to connect Langley Township with its surroundings. The British Columbia Electric Railway was built through the community in 1910, followed by Fraser Highway in the 1920s, and the construction of the Pattullo Bridge in 1937, all adding to Langley&#x27;s importance.

These developments impacted the Langley Prairie area in particular, transforming it into the Township&#x27;s main urban and commercial core. In turn, this birthed the need for upgraded and new amenities, especially with respect to health, infrastructure, safety and sanitation, in the neighbourhood. The municipal government, however, refused to finance these projects as it bowed, instead, to politically influential farming communities and smaller, mostly rural, business centres, like Fort Langley, Milner and Murrayville, that viewed such spending as unnecessary. Talk of secession began in Langley Prairie in the 1930s, as a result. Headed by a panel of important residents and businesspersons, including Richard Langdon, president of the Langley Board of Trade, the push for independence came to a head in the 1950s. Specifically, two issues decided Langley&#x27;s future - street lights, which Langley Prairie argued were not only needed for safety but also progress, but on which reeve George Brooks declared &quot;not a nickel&quot; would be spent, and Langley Prairie&#x27;s belief that it did not have the political sway or its fair share of municipal services that it deserved relative to its local tax contribution. Langley Prairie by now made up 20% of the Township&#x27;s tax base. A referendum on secession was therefore held in September, 1954. It passed with over 85% of the vote. Langley Prairie officially seceded and became the City of Langley on March 15, 1955.

=== Post-World War II period (1955–1999) ===

Langley&#x27;s growth increased during the economic boom after the Second World War. In 1957, Langley Township, along with other municipalities in British Columbia adopted the grid system for the road network. In 1967, Langley Township became part of Metro Vancouver. As with many other parts of Canada and cities in the United States, the Vancouver region expanded with the growth of the suburb. With the completion of the faster Trans-Canada Highway route in 1964 in the north of Langley, suburb communities such as Walnut Grove appeared in Langley which were popular with commuters. Most of this growth happened outside of the original communities of Fort Langley and Murrayville, instead happening adjacent to Langley City and near the Trans-Canada highway, likely due to the influence of private automobiles.

=== 21st century ===
In February 2006, the Township of Langley moved its Municipal Hall from the &quot;core area&quot; of the Township to the growing Willoughby area. The new facility also includes a new library, fitness room (which incorporates a special type of hardwood floor room) and a new community policing station.

Since the 1980s, Langley City and surrounding lands administered by the municipality have been subject to extensive strip mall development. The old town core remains pleasant to walk through, but many core businesses (including the civil courts and several banks) have moved to the malls, fostering an automobile-dominated community. In addition to this, the community allowed extensive strip development along the Langley Bypass, which has become the new sprawled business area of the city.

In the 1990s, the Village of Fort Langley has undergone a revitalization of its core that enhanced its heritage character. In fact, there are no franchises permitted in the village and this has raised its profile as a tourist and independent retail destination with hundreds of thousands of annual visitors. A rowing facility completed in 2009 brings a whole new segment of visitors to the area. In 2016, the landmark Coulter Berry Building was completed, marking the first LEED certified building in Fort Langley.

Construction of the Golden Ears Bridge has been completed and opened to traffic on June 16, 2009. The bridge spans the Fraser River and connects the Township of Langley with the communities of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows. In addition, the plan for the Carvolth Neighbourhood in Willoughby is promoting the construction of new office buildings in proximity to Highway 1 and 200th Street.
== Climate ==


==Culture ==
=== Suburban ===

The Township of Langley is largely a suburban community, but, while the centre is increasingly urban, the periphery (particularly in the south and southeast) maintains its agricultural nature. The neighbourhoods of Willoughby and Walnut Grove are quite suburban and feature large numbers of big-box stores, the Willowbrook Shopping Centre, and the Famous Players Colossus Theatre Complex.

===Historic===
Fort Langley has the distinguished title of being &quot;The Birthplace of British Columbia&quot;. The Fort Langley National Historic Site, which puts on events and exhibits relevant to the history of the area, is open to the public. Additionally, the village itself has areas of historical interest.

Elsewhere in Langley is the Twilight Drive-ina drive-in movie theatre, the Canadian Museum of Flight, numerous parks, rivers, and horse farms. The Otter Co-op is a major commercial and agricultural centre for the community of Aldergrove.

In South Langley is Campbell Valley Regional Park, a large Metro Vancouver Regional Park. Within the park boundaries are the historic Rowlatt Farmstead, clearly visible logging railway grades, and the historic Lochiel Schoolhouse.

===Produce===
==== Wine ====
Langley takes part in British Columbia&#x27;s wine-making tradition and has many wineries with a temperate climate which allow grapes to grow. This includes places such as the Fort Wine Co. in Fort Langley, and Vista D&#x27;oro winery in the south, both of which have produced award-winning wines, with the latter reaching international acclaim at the Shanghai International Wine Competition 2012.

====Other====
In the agricultural areas of Langley, farms produce a variety of fruits and vegetables, meat, dairy and eggs. It is not unusual to see signs on the roadside advertising fresh produce sold direct from the farm. The Langley Circle Farm Tour is a popular way for tourists to experience the various farms and see what Langley produces.

Alpacas are farmed in Langley, Kensington Prairie Farm retails an array of specialized alpaca products including rovings, yarn, socks, toques, mitts, scarves, shawls, apparel and housewares.

===Arts &amp; sports===
Langley is home to the Langley Rugby Club of the British Columbia Rugby Union, Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League, the Vancouver Bandits of the Canadian Elite Basketball League, the Langley Rivermen of the British Columbia Hockey League, the Langley Rams of the British Columbia Conference of the Canadian Junior Football League who are based at the MacLeod Stadium, the Langley Blaze of the PBL Premier Baseball League and the Trinity Western University Spartans in Canadian Interuniversity Sport.

In 2023, Vancouver FC from Langley debuted in the Canadian Premier League.

There are several ice rinks in town, including the George Preston Centre in Brookswood, the Sportsplex in Walnut Grove, and the Aldergrove arena. There are public swimming pools located at the Walnut Grove Community Centre, the W.C. Blair Recreation Centre in Murrayville, and the Fort Langley Outdoor Pool. The Al Anderson Memorial Pool is also nearby in Langley City.

The Langley Ukulele Ensemble is one of the more noteworthy cultural acts to be based out of the district.

===Equine===
With a local equine industry valued at over $60 million annually, the Township of Langley has become the Horse Capital of BC. As of 2006, Langley farms represented 7.2% of the provincial total of horses and ponies.

== Education ==

=== Schools ===
Langley Township is served by the School District 35 Langley. It also contains one francophone elementary school, École des Voyageurs, which is part of the province-wide CSF (conseil scolaire francophone), School District 93, and there is the Langley Fine Arts School in Fort Langley. The largest school in Langley is the Walnut Grove Secondary School which has about 2000 students.

=== Post-secondary education ===
Langley is home to one campus of Kwantlen Polytechnic University, and to Trinity Western University, a private Christian liberal arts university.

==Transportation==

===Road network===

====Streets and avenues====
0 Avenue is along the U.S. border, and avenue numbers are incremented based on eight per mile (1.6 km), so for example 80 Avenue would be from the border. Street numbers also increment eight per mile as they go further east. There are roads that break this system such as Fraser Highway, Glover Road and Old Yale Road, because they existed before the grid system was introduced.

Many of the old road names have been replaced with numeric designations, however Heritage and Pioneer markers installed by the council are placed on many of the roads to highlight their original name.

====Trans-Canada Highway====
Highway 1, also known as the Trans-Canada Highway, cuts through the northern part of Langley. The Walnut Grove and Willoughby communities are popular with commuters due to being the most developed areas with the easiest access to the highway.

By road, the highway is the fastest method of reaching Vancouver and all the cities along the route, such as Surrey, Coquitlam, New Westminster and Burnaby. Depending on the traffic volume it can take between 25 and 35 minutes to enter Vancouver city limits. For reaching Downtown Vancouver, drivers can exit at Hastings Street and continue westbound into the downtown core.

In 2012, upgrades to the highway in the Langley and Surrey region have widened the highway by two lanes in each direction - one new HOV lane and one new regular lane - which has reduced traffic congestion. In addition to this there are HOV exits which provide direct access into the communities for Buses, Motorcycles and Cars with more than one occupant.


In addition to the five interchanges, three vehicle overpasses - at 208th Street, Glover Road and 248th Street - cross over the highway. An overpass carries rail traffic exclusively a few hundred metres east of Glover Road.

====Fraser Highway====

Fraser Highway used to be part of the Trans-Canada Highway but was replaced in 1964. It is a major road that runs from the centre of Surrey, through Cloverdale, the City of Langley, Murrayville and continues on to Abbotsford. While the speed limit between Langley and Abbotsford qualifies as highway speed at 80 km/h, between Langley and Surrey the speed limit is primarily 60 km/h with the route having frequent traffic lights. This usually means longer travel time than using Highway 1 to reach Surrey City Centre. However, since Fraser Highway goes directly between urban centres, it remains a popular route.

====200 Street====
200 is the longest street that runs through Langley and is a major traffic artery. It starts at 0 Avenue at the U.S. Border (as Carvolth Road), up through Brookswood, into the City of Langley centre, and continues north through Walnut Grove to the Golden Ears Bridge which leads into Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge across the Fraser River.

===United States border===
Langley is situated directly north of and along the United States border, with Washington state to the south. The northernmost point in Langley is less than 25 km from the border. Langley contains one of the five Lower Mainland border crossings in the community of Aldergrove, however British Columbia Highway 15, which only 3.5 km to the west of Langley in Surrey, leads to the larger Pacific Highway Crossing. Crossing the border here is often faster due to having more open crossing lanes including NEXUS lanes which offer faster crossings for those opted into the NEXUS program.

===Bus services===

The region is served by TransLink which provides bus services connecting Langley to its neighbouring cities. The largest transit hub in the Township of Langley is Carvolth Exchange - a bus terminal with a park and ride situated next to the Trans-Canada Highway on 202nd Street which provides service to various parts of Langley and the Lower Mainland. Notable is the #555 service, an express bus that connects Langley to Lougheed Town Centre station in Burnaby crossing the Port Mann Bridge. This route uses the HOV interchanges on the highway, stopping at Surrey (via the 156th Street HOV interchange) and using the Government Street and 202nd Street HOV interchanges to leave and exit the highway.

===Rail services===

====SkyTrain====
The SkyTrain rapid transit system is due to be extended to Langley by 2028. Two Skytrain stations are planned for Langley, one at the border between Surrey and the Township of Langley at 196 Street, and another in the City of Langley at 203 Street.

====Passenger service====
The community group South Fraser Community Rail have been campaigning for TransLink to run passenger trains along existing railway tracks through the Fraser Valley from Surrey, through Langley to Chilliwack. The tracks were previously used for the BCER Interurban in the early 20th century but are maintained and in use today for freight rail traffic with passenger rail right-of-way. If implemented, this could potentially include stops at Fort Langley and Milner.

====Freight====
The city is served by four railways: Canadian National Railway (CN), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF), and the shortline Southern Railway of British Columbia (SRY).

===Airports===
CYNJ 
Langley is serviced by Langley Regional Airport, a small controlled airport with no scheduled service. Harbour Air, the largest float-carrier in the world, formerly served Langley with scheduled service but terminated these flights due to low passenger numbers in 2011. The Langley Airport is also home to the Canadian Museum of Flight, as well as SkyQuest Aviation and Standard Aero, a helicopter maintenance and modification contractor. It features 2 runways with a maximum length of 2743 feet and 2 helipads. In 2018 Langley airport had 75,954 movements

CBQ2
Fort Langley airport is a private airport located in north Langley adjacent to the Fraser River. It has a single 5510 foot runway and float plane access to the river.
