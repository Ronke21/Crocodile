<text>The Swinomish people ( ; ) are a Lushootseed-speaking people Indigenous to western Washington state. 

The tribe lives in the southeastern part of Fidalgo Island in northern Puget Sound, near the San Juan Islands, in Skagit County, Washington. Skagit County is located about north of Seattle

Swinomish people are enrolled in the federally recognized Swinomish Indian Tribal Community, also known as the Swinomish Tribe, which is headquartered in Swinomish Village, across the Swinomish Channel from La Conner.

== Classification ==
The Swinomish are a Southern Coast Salish people. The Southern Coast Salish includes the many Lushootseed-speaking peoples as well as the Twana.

The Swinomish are closely related to their historical neighbors, including the Squinamish, Lower Skagit, and Kikiallus peoples. In the early colonial period, whites believed that the Swinomish were a part of the Lower Skagit, however, they were separate and distinct peoples.

==History==
According to the 20th century Swinomish historian Martin J. Sampson, the Swinomish people descend from a group of Kikiallus people who left their village at what is now Utsalady to settle in Shelter Bay. After their establishment, they prospered and eventually became their own distinct group. Alternatively, another origin story states that the Swinomish are descended from a noble&#x27;s son who gained a powerful spirit power, and he and his wife became the ancestor of all peoples.

Around 1830–1835, a major smallpox epidemic blazed through the villages of Skagit County, including the Swinomish. The epidemics reduced the Swinomish populations by up to 80%, according to some estimations. Around 1855, the U.S. government recorded the Swinomish population to be around 150–200 people.

In 1855, the Swinomish were party to the Treaty of Point Elliott. Under the treaty, the Swinomish Reservation was established, and the Swinomish were required to remove to it. Three Swinomish signed the treaty: Belole, Stodumkan, and Kelkahltsoot. The U.S. Government hoped that the Swinomish would turn to farming once the reservation was established. By 1884, about three-fourths of the Swinomish were logging, farming, and milling.

Throughout the 1860s, many Swinomish left their homelands, scattering around Puget Sound in search of work. On the reservation, there were clashes between settlers and Swinomish regarding the boundaries of their lands.

== Territory and land base ==
Historically, the Swinomish controlled much of Fidalgo Island. Their territory included the entire eastern half of Fidalgo Island down to Deception Pass, all of Whidbey Island above the northern half of Dugualla Bay, as well as a portion of Padilla Bay and the mainland north of the Skagit River extending about halfway to what is now Mount Vernon.

After the 1855 treaty, the Swinomish were constrained to the Swinomish Reservation, alongside the other bands of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. They continue to exercise their sovereignty as a domestic dependent nation of the United States. 

=== Villages ===
Like other Coast Salish peoples, the Swinomish traditionally built permanent villages along waterways, especially near fresh water outlets like rivers and creeks. Villages were independent from one another, but nominally connected to the other Swinomish villages through kinship ties and shared customs and language.

One of the main villages of the Swinomish was located near the headwaters of Sullivan Slough, near today&#x27;s La Conner. This village was fortified by deep ditches filled with sharp ironwood stakes surrounding the village. Its strategic value was further amplified by its location: it could only be reached by large war canoes at high tide. This village was decimated by smallpox, with only one surviving family. Many of the Swinomish today are descended from this family.
==Culture==

=== Lifestyle ===
The lifestyle of the Swinomish, like other Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast, is highly reliant on the usage of marine resources, such as salmon fishing and shellfish gathering. They reserved the right to fish and harvest in their usual and accustomed areas in the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855. The Swinomish are highly reliant on their marine resources. In pre-colonial times, as much as 70% percent of their food came from marine resources. The traditional fishing methods of the Swinomish included using traps that led fish from deep water into the shallows where they could be easily collected. This kind of trap was used by the Swinomish at Dugualla Bay, Turner Bay, along the North Fork of the Skagit River, and all along the Swinomish Channel. 

Today, the Swinomish continue to be involved heavily in the fishing industry. Although some usage of traditional fishing methods continues, the majority of fishing is commercial. Through the Swinomish Tribe, they have been engaged in conflicts with the federal government over fishing rights. Most Swinomish are dependent on fishing, farm labor, or lumbering as income. Others make their income as craftspeople, selling Native arts and crafts. 

The Swinomish traditionally used clam gardens to farm clams. In 2022, the Swinomish Tribe built the first clam garden in the United States in 200 years. 

The Swinomish also traditionally gathered berries and roots, and, after the introduction of potatoes, they became part of the Swinomish diet.

In pre-colonial times, the Swinomish were semi-migratory. In the summer, Swinomish people travelled to fishing and gathering sites near their villages.

By 1883, much of the population of the Swinomish Reservation had turned to logging, milling, and farming. Around three-fourths had made the switch, with the remainder still living engaged in traditional subsistence patterns.

The primary watergoing vessel for much of Swinomish history has been the canoe. Although modern motorized watercraft are the mainly utilized vehicle now, canoes still carry a high degree of cultural significance and are used at cultural events. The Swinomish canoes are similar to those of other Coast Salish peoples. Saltwater canoes are traditionally decorated at the prow and can be up to fifty feet long.

=== Religion ===
After colonization, many Swinomish converted to Christianity. One of the prominent denominations of the Swinomish was historically the Indian Shaker Church. A Shaker church was built on the Swinomish Reservation in 1939, but individuals practiced privately in their homes since 1910. Protestantism was introduced to the Swinomish in 1894 after the establishment of the Swinomish Day School, a boarding school operated by the federal government.

Today, most members of the Swinomish Tribe are Catholic.

=== Language ===

The language of the Swinomish is Lushootseed. Historically, the language has also been knowwn as &quot;Skagit.&quot; According to their tradition, their language originated with the Kikiallus, from whence the Swinomish and other Skagit-speaking peoples migrated.

In historic times, many also spoke Chinook Jargon, a trade language used for communication between settlers and Indigenous peoples in the 19th century.

The Swinomish people speak a subdialect of the Northern dialect of the Lushootseed language.

== Society ==

=== Pre-colonial society ===
Traditional Swinomish society was organized on the village and family level. Each village was composed of several families and their leaders, who had a certain standing among others of the village due to their material wealth and social prestige. However, none of these important members of a village had complete control over the rest of the village.

* Matika Wilbur, Tulalip citizen, educator, and photographer

<text>Tim Skold (born Thim Sköld; 14 December 1966) is a Swedish musician and record producer who produces solo work and has also collaborated with multiple musical groups including Shotgun Messiah, KMFDM, Marilyn Manson and Motionless in White.
==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Skövde, Skold grew up in Timmersdala, outside of Skövde. Influenced by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, he acquired his first bass guitar at age 12 and played in various cover bands. He later met guitarist Harry &quot;Harry Cody&quot; Kemppainen at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, and the two formed a creative partnership with a shared dream of becoming rock stars in the United States. At age 17, after two years of studying Process Engineering at a boarding school, Skold moved into his own apartment and took a factory job making military equipment. A half-year later, he was drafted into the army. He brought his bass to the base and sneaked into the shower stalls to practice after everyone went to sleep. Skold also kept rehearsing with Cody on the weekends, and once out of the army he took on many odd jobs, including working as a library assistant, Volvo employee and gardener at a bathhouse.

===Kingpin===
During the early 1980s, Skold and Cody formed the glam metal band Kingpin in their native Skövde, Sweden. The duo were inspired by the flamboyant hard rock bands flowing out of Los Angeles at the time, as well as the UK acts such as Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Zodiac Mindwarp. The duo drafted vocalist Zinny J. Zan and drummer Stixx Galore a short time later to complete the band&#x27;s lineup. Kingpin&#x27;s first release was a 1987 single titled &quot;Shout It Out&quot;, which reached number 1 in Swedish charts. They released their only album, &quot;Welcome to Bop City&quot;, the following year, and subsequently moved to Los Angeles.

===Shotgun Messiah===
Signed by Cliff Cultreri at Relativity Records, Kingpin changed their name to Shotgun Messiah due to a San Francisco-based act holding the rights to the band name. The band remixed and re-packaged &quot;Welcome To Bop City&quot; as a self-titled album and released it as their international debut in 1989. The album would go on to sell almost 500,000 copies and reached top 100 on the Billboard charts. The music videos for the singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Care &#x27;Bout Nothin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Shout It Out&quot; regularly featured on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbanger&#x27;s Ball&quot;.

Whilst the band was in the process of making a follow-up to their debut self-titled album, singer Zan was let go. On Cody&#x27;s suggestion, Skold switched to lead vocals and the members hired a new bassist, Bobby Lycon from New York City. The band released their second album, &quot;Second Coming&quot;, in October 1991 to rave reviews. The album featured two singles, &quot;Heartbreak Blvd.&quot; and &quot;Living Without You&quot;.

In November 1992, Shotgun Messiah released the five-track EP &quot;I Want More&quot;, which featured two new punk cover tracks and a re-recorded &quot;Babylon&quot; punk cover, along with a re-recorded &quot;I Want More&quot; edit and an acoustic version of &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot;, all three from their previous album &quot;Second Coming&quot;. Soon after came the departure of Stixx and Lycon.

Still under contract with Relativity Records, Skold and Cody returned to Sweden for the recording of the third Shotgun Messiah album, &quot;Violent New Breed&quot;, which leaned towards the industrial end of the heavy metal genre. The album was released in September 1993 to mixed reviews and continued public indifference due to the popularity of the grunge genre, which eventually convinced Skold and Cody to end the band, leading Skold to embark on an eponymous solo project. 

===SKOLD===
Following the break-up of Shotgun Messiah, Skold went on to pursue a solo career. Writing all songs and playing all instruments himself, his self-titled debut album, &quot;Skold&quot;, was released in 1996 by RCA. The album was co-produced with Scott Humphrey. Promoting his debut album, Skold and the rest of the live SKOLD band went on a short tour with Genitorturers. Some of the songs on the &quot;Skold&quot; album were used in movies like Disturbing Behavior (&quot;Hail Mary&quot;), Universal Soldier: The Return (&quot;Chaos&quot;) and the PlayStation game Twisted Metal 4 (&quot;Chaos&quot;). During his solo career, Skold also provided remixes for several bands, such as Prong, Nature and Drown. He also met KMFDM front-man Sascha Konietzko during his time in the studio.

Around 2002, Skold recorded a follow up to his 1996 self-titled album. Skold stated in an interview with &quot;The Sychophant&quot; that he had made a demo with 10 copies ever made. The demo had 10 songs on it. Six of the 10 were released on file sharing networks without Skold&#x27;s permission: &quot;Burn&quot;, &quot;Dead God&quot;, &quot;I Hate&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;The Point&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Pray&quot;. The demo is known as the &quot;Dead God EP&quot;, although Skold says that it was called &quot;Disrupting the Orderly Routine of the Institution&quot;. The original artwork was made with an inkjet printer and was the title written in drippy letters. This demo was given to several friends that Skold considered trustworthy, but his songs appeared on the internet from one of them. Skold said that &quot;someone suggested to me that I should go back to them and finish it off and release it. And maybe I will one day, who knows?&quot; All 10 songs were eventually officially released in 2022 as the album &quot;Dead God&quot;.

On 3 November 2009 &quot;I Will Not Forget&quot;, &quot;A Dark Star&quot;, and &quot;Bullets Ricochet&quot; were released on iTunes and Amazon as new SKOLD singles. Also that November, Skold&#x27;s official website announced that he was to release his second solo album in early 2010. However, the album remained unreleased in 2010. In January 2011, Metropolis Records announced that they were releasing the new record and single in spring of 2011. On 10 May 2011 SKOLD released &quot;Anomie&quot;.

Originally announced on 17 March 2014, the album, entitled &quot;The Undoing&quot;, was originally slated for self-release in April 2014. Problems with that model arose and the album release was halted until 2016 when SKOLD rejoined with Metropolis Records to release the work. In support of this album, SKOLD began &quot;The Undoing Tour 2016&quot; in May 2016 with the western United States; the live line up featured Tiffany Lowe on keyboards and Eli James on drums. This was followed by a cross-US North American tour in November and December 2016.
The setlist spanned Tim&#x27;s entire career and contained such hits as &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, &quot;Error 404&quot;, &quot;Anarchy&quot;, &quot;Tainted Love&quot;, as well as &quot;Chaos&quot; and &quot;Hail Mary&quot; from his debut album, just to name a few. He was very accessible after shows and more than happy to discuss firearms and lipstick, as well as gear over a beer.

In 2018, SKOLD released a cover of the song &quot;White As Chalk&quot; by Leæther Strip on the compilation album &quot;Heært Combine&quot;.

On 5 April 2019, SKOLD released the album &quot;Never Is Now&quot; on Cleopatra Records.

On 5 March 2021, SKOLD released the album &quot;Dies Irae&quot; on Cleopatra Records.

In 2022 the long-awaited exhumation of (a) &#x27;Dead God&#x27; was performed and realised, offering up a proper release and making his proclamations upon the &quot;true&quot; evils of organized religion and idolatry official.

On 28 July, 2023, SKOLD released the album &quot;Seven Heads&quot; with the single &quot;Rat King&quot;, also on Cleopatra Records.

===KMFDM and MDFMK===
After a short-lived solo career, Skold joined KMFDM in 1997. His first involvement with KMFDM was on the album &quot;Symbols&quot;. He wrote and sang the song &quot;Anarchy&quot;, which became a hit in clubs, and spawned subsequent remixes of the track done by Skold himself. His next album with KMFDM, &quot;Adios&quot;, was released in 1999. Skold took a more prominent role in the band, not only as co-vocalist, co-writer, and bassist, but also as producer, engineer, and programmer, alongside KMFDM&#x27;s founder Sascha Konietzko.Due to turmoil within the band, Konietzko and Skold ended KMFDM in 1999, and restarted as MDFMK the following year. They released one album, &quot;MDFMK&quot;, released in 2000 by Universal Records. The band, including Lucia Cifarelli (formerly of Drill), took on a more &quot;futuristic&quot; sound, which contained less of the industrial rock KMFDM was known for, and added a mix of drum &amp; bass, trance and europop, primarily in a production style leaning towards &quot;electronica&quot;. MDFMK featured all three members sharing vocal duties. Their song &quot;Missing Time&quot; was used in the animated movie Heavy Metal 2000.

In 2002, the trio reformed KMFDM along with Raymond Watts, and released &quot;Attak&quot;. Afterwards, Skold departed the band. Due to a commitment to produce Marilyn Manson&#x27;s album &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot;, Skold was unable to join KMFDM&#x27;s 2002 Sturm &amp; Drang tour; he did, however, make two guest appearances at shows in June.

On 16 December 2008 the KMFDM website announced that Skold and Konietzko would be releasing an album together, titled &quot;Skold vs. KMFDM&quot;. The album was released on 24 February 2009.

Skold did production and instrumentation work on KMFDM&#x27;s album &quot;Blitz&quot;, released 24 March 2009. Later that same year he contributed a remix to Left Spine Down&#x27;s 2009 remix album entitled &quot;Voltage 2.3: Remixed and Revisited&quot;, as well as 16volt&#x27;s album &quot;American Porn Songs&quot;.

===Newlydeads and ohGr===
Skold performed a show as a fill-in guitarist with Taime Downe&#x27;s The Newlydeads on 13 December 2000 at the Pretty Ugly Club in Los Angeles. Skold, on bass, joined ohGr, a project of Skinny Puppy vocalist Nivek Ogre, for the tour in support of its first album, &quot;Welt&quot;, in 2001, although he does not appear on the album.

===Marilyn Manson===
Skold&#x27;s involvement with Marilyn Manson began as producer for the single &quot;Tainted Love&quot;, which is featured in the 2001 teen comedy/parody movie &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; and appeared on the soundtrack. Manson and Skold went on to score the movie &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, released in 2002. Several tracks are featured on the Resident Evil movie soundtrack.

Skold officially joined Marilyn Manson in 2002 after the departure of bassist Twiggy Ramirez. At this time, not only was Skold the bassist for the band, but he was also producing, editing, creating artwork, electronics, programming drums and beats, playing guitar, keyboards, accordion and synthesizer bass for the album &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot;.

He is described by Manson as, &quot;the power that attitude brings to an album&quot;. On the band&#x27;s 2004 release, &quot;Lest We Forget: The Best Of&quot;, Skold produced, played lead guitar, and sang backup vocals on the cover version of &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, which was also released as a single. Coinciding with the release of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D&quot; in October 2006, Manson and Skold contributed a cover of &quot;This Is Halloween&quot; to &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; soundtrack, with Skold taking care of the music while Manson provided the vocals.

This time also saw the start of work on Marilyn Manson&#x27;s sixth studio album entitled &quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot;. The album was released worldwide on 5 June 2007.

Skold played guitar on the band&#x27;s 2007 world tour, Rape of the World, with Rob Holliday (formerly guitarist/bassist for Curve, Gary Numan, The Mission and The Prodigy) taking over bass duties.

On 9 January 2008, Marilyn Manson posted a bulletin on MySpace which reported that Skold had left the band and former bassist Twiggy Ramirez had returned to take his place.

In mid-November 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Skold was again working with Manson. No contributions from Skold appeared on Manson&#x27;s comeback album &quot;One Assassination Under God - Chapter 1&quot;.

===Doctor Midnight &amp; The Mercy Cult===
In 2009, Skold formed the Scandinavian supergroup Doctor Midnight &amp; The Mercy Cult with Hank von Helvete. They released their debut album, &quot;I Declare: Treason&quot;, on 6 June 2011.

===Motionless in White===
Skold, along with Jason Suecof, produced Motionless in White&#x27;s 2012 studio album &quot;Infamous&quot;. Skold also contributed songwriting on 5 songs. Skold was also announced as a featured artist on the song &quot;Final Dictvm&quot; from the album &quot;Reincarnate&quot;.

===Not My God===
In January 2020, Skold and Nero Bellum announced a new project dubbed Not My God. Their self-titled album was released on 14 February 2020. The follow-up album, &quot;Simulacra&quot;, was released on 15 October 2021. Their third album, &quot;Obverses&quot;, was released 12 May 2023.

===Front Line Assembly===
Skold played guitar with Front Line Assembly on their 2021 and 2023 tours.

==Musical styles==
Skold has performed many different music genres ranging from glam metal to heavy metal to industrial rock to electro-industrial. His breakthrough band Shotgun Messiah evolved from the glam metal and hard rock genres to industrial rock for their third and final album. Beginning with the Skold solo project, he has recorded and performed mainly with industrial and heavy metal acts such as Marilyn Manson, KMFDM, MDFMK, ohGr, The Newlydeads and Doctor Midnight &amp; The Mercy Cult.

==Musical equipment==
Throughout his career Skold has played several different instruments and used equipment from different manufacturers. In a Behind the Player video released in 2008, Skold states that he uses Gibson Les Paul guitars in the studio and Gibson Firebird models live with Marshall amps, and Gretsch Broadkaster basses with Ampeg amps.

<text>In mathematics, a free module is a module that has a &quot;basis&quot;, that is, a generating set that is linearly independent. Every vector space is a free module, but, if the ring of the coefficients is not a division ring (not a field in the commutative case), then there exist non-free modules.

Given any set and ring , there is a free -module with basis , which is called the &quot;free module on&quot; or &quot;module of formal&quot; -&quot;linear combinations&quot; of the elements of .

A free abelian group is precisely a free module over the ring formula_1 of integers.

== Definition ==

For a ring formula_2 and an formula_2-module formula_4, the set formula_5 is a basis for formula_4 if:
* formula_7 is a generating set for formula_4; that is to say, every element of formula_4 is a finite sum of elements of formula_7 multiplied by coefficients in formula_2; and
* formula_7 is linearly independent if for every formula_13 of distinct elements, formula_14 implies that formula_15 (where formula_16 is the zero element of formula_4 and formula_18 is the zero element of formula_2).

A free module is a module with a basis.

An immediate consequence of the second half of the definition is that the coefficients in the first half are unique for each element of &quot;M&quot;.

If formula_2 has invariant basis number, then by definition any two bases have the same cardinality. For example, nonzero commutative rings have invariant basis number. The cardinality of any (and therefore every) basis is called the rank of the free module formula_4. If this cardinality is finite, the free module is said to be &quot;free of finite rank&quot;, or &quot;free of rank&quot; if the rank is known to be .

== Examples ==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring.
* &quot;R&quot; is a free module of rank one over itself (either as a left or right module); any unit element is a basis.
* More generally, If &quot;R&quot; is commutative, a nonzero ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;R&quot; is free if and only if it is a principal ideal generated by a nonzerodivisor, with a generator being a basis.
* Over a principal ideal domain (e.g., formula_22), a submodule of a free module is free.
* If &quot;R&quot; is commutative, the polynomial ring formula_23 in indeterminate &quot;X&quot; is a free module with a possible basis 1, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;X&quot;2, ...
* Let formula_24 be a polynomial ring over a commutative ring &quot;A&quot;, &quot;f&quot; a monic polynomial of degree &quot;d&quot; there, formula_25 and formula_26 the image of &quot;t&quot; in &quot;B&quot;. Then &quot;B&quot; contains &quot;A&quot; as a subring and is free as an &quot;A&quot;-module with a basis formula_27.
* For any non-negative integer &quot;n&quot;, formula_28, the cartesian product of &quot;n&quot; copies of &quot;R&quot; as a left &quot;R&quot;-module, is free. If &quot;R&quot; has invariant basis number, then its rank is &quot;n&quot;.
* A direct sum of free modules is free, while an infinite cartesian product of free modules is generally &quot;not&quot; free (cf. the Baer–Specker group).
* A finitely generated module over a commutative local ring is free if and only if it is faithfully flat. Also, Kaplansky&#x27;s theorem states a projective module over a (possibly non-commutative) local ring is free.
* Sometimes, whether a module is free or not is undecidable in the set-theoretic sense. A famous example is the Whitehead problem, which asks whether a Whitehead group is free or not. As it turns out, the problem is independent of ZFC.

== Formal linear combinations ==

Given a set and ring , there is a free -module that has as a basis: namely, the direct sum of copies of &quot;R&quot; indexed by &quot;E&quot;
: formula_29.
Explicitly, it is the submodule of the Cartesian product formula_30 (&quot;R&quot; is viewed as say a left module) that consists of the elements that have only finitely many nonzero components. One can embed &quot;E&quot; into as a subset by identifying an element &quot;e&quot; with that of whose &quot;e&quot;-th component is 1 (the unity of &quot;R&quot;) and all the other components are zero. Then each element of can be written uniquely as
: formula_31
where only finitely many formula_32 are nonzero. It is called a &quot;formal linear combination&quot; of elements of .

A similar argument shows that every free left (resp. right) &quot;R&quot;-module is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of &quot;R&quot; as left (resp. right) module.

=== Another construction ===

The free module may also be constructed in the following equivalent way.

Given a ring &quot;R&quot; and a set &quot;E&quot;, first as a set we let
: formula_33
We equip it with a structure of a left module such that the addition is defined by: for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;E&quot;,
: formula_34
and the scalar multiplication by: for &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in &quot;E&quot;,
: formula_35

Now, as an &quot;R&quot;-valued function on &quot;E&quot;, each &quot;f&quot; in formula_36 can be written uniquely as
: formula_37
where formula_32 are in &quot;R&quot; and only finitely many of them are nonzero and formula_39 is given as
: formula_40
(this is a variant of the Kronecker delta). The above means that the subset formula_41 of formula_36 is a basis of formula_36. The mapping formula_44 is a bijection between and this basis. Through this bijection, formula_36 is a free module with the basis &quot;E&quot;.

== Universal property ==

The inclusion mapping formula_46 defined above is universal in the following sense. Given an arbitrary function formula_47 from a set to a left -module , there exists a unique module homomorphism formula_48 such that formula_49; namely, formula_50 is defined by the formula:
:formula_51
and formula_50 is said to be obtained by &quot;extending formula_53 by linearity.&quot; The uniqueness means that each &quot;R&quot;-linear map formula_54 is uniquely determined by its restriction to &quot;E&quot;.

As usual for universal properties, this defines up to a canonical isomorphism. Also the formation of formula_46 for each set &quot;E&quot; determines a functor
: formula_56,
from the category of sets to the category of left -modules. It is called the free functor and satisfies a natural relation: for each set &quot;E&quot; and a left module &quot;N&quot;,
: formula_57
where formula_58 is the forgetful functor, meaning formula_59 is a left adjoint of the forgetful functor.

== Generalizations ==

Many statements true for free modules extend to certain larger classes of modules. Projective modules are direct summands of free modules. Flat modules are defined by the property that tensoring with them preserves exact sequences. Torsion-free modules form an even broader class. For a finitely generated module over a PID (such as Z), the properties free, projective, flat, and torsion-free are equivalent.

<doc id="326455" wikidata="Q648940" url="?curid=326455" title="Symphony X">
<text>Symphony X is an American progressive metal band from Middletown, New Jersey. Founded in 1994, the band consists of guitarist Michael Romeo, keyboardist Michael Pinnella, drummer Jason Rullo, lead vocalist Russell Allen and bassist Michael LePond.

They achieved some commercial success with the 2007 album &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and the 2011 album &quot;Iconoclast&quot;, which reached number 76 on the Billboard 200.

The albums &quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot; and &quot;V: The New Mythology Suite&quot; were partially recorded in &quot;The Dungeon&quot;, Romeo&#x27;s home studio. &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Iconoclast&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot; were fully recorded there and produced by Romeo himself.

==History==
===&quot;Symphony X&quot; and &quot;The Damnation Game&quot; (1994−1995)===
In 1992, Michael Romeo (formerly of the bands Phantom&#x27;s Opera and Gemini) recorded a demo album in his apartment which was sent to various record labels. The tape attracted attention in Japan with the now-defunct record company Zero Corporation. In April 1994, a new version of &quot;The Dark Chapter&quot;, which featured Romeo and keyboard player Michael Pinnella, was released by Zero Corporation.

When asked by Zero Corporation if he had a band in the same genre, Romeo recruited bassist Thomas Miller, drummer Jason Rullo, and vocalist Rod Tyler, with Pinella remaining on keys. Together, the band recorded a demo tape entitled &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; some time in 1994. It is unclear if the tape was intended for Zero Corporation alone, or if it was sent to other record labels for consideration. Two songs from the demo would be recorded for the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, which was released by Zero Corporation in December 1994.

Romeo explained the band&#x27;s name in a 2008 interview; &quot;the music we were coming up with had the keyboard thing and the guitar, and some classical elements, so the word &#x27;Symphony&#x27; came up and ... then, somebody said &#x27;Symphony X&#x27; and we were like, &#x27;yeah, that&#x27;s cool&#x27; it is that kinda thing, and the &#x27;X&#x27; is the unknown and all the other stuff we do.&quot;

After the release of &quot;Symphony X&quot; in 1994, Rod Tyler left the band due to creative differences and was replaced by current singer Russell Allen, who Tyler had previously introduced to the band. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Damnation Game&quot;, released in August 1995. Both albums were released in Asia through Japanese company Zero Corporation, and were later released in Europe under license to German company Inside Out.

===&quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Twilight in Olympus&quot; (1996−1998)===
&quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot;, recorded in 1996 and released in November of the same year by Zero Corporation in Japan, proved to be successful for the band, generating interest outside of Japan and within wider circles in the metal community. The album would have a European release in March 1997, again through German label Inside Out. In a 2008 interview, Romeo recalled &quot;it felt like we were a ‘real band’ now, we really had our thing going and more and more people were getting exposed to it.&quot; The album was positively received, with AllMusic praising Romeo&#x27;s &quot;pyrotechnic displays&quot; and describing Pinella and Miller as &quot;equally competent on their respective instruments&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot;, drummer Rullo left the band for personal reasons. Romeo would later recall there was some tension in the band at the time between drummer Rullo and bassist Miller. The band recruited a new drummer, Thomas Walling, to replace Rullo and recorded &quot;Twilight in Olympus&quot; in 1998. The album was released in February 1998 via Zero Corporation in Japan and simultaneously via Inside Out in Europe. The album released to favourable reviews, though Romeo has since voiced his concerns that the album was &quot;rushed&quot; due to pressure from Zero Corporation as well as &quot;rushing back into the studio to get stuff done with [Walling],&quot; continuing &quot;I think of all our albums, that&#x27;s not one of my favourites mainly because of that reason - it&#x27;s kinda rushed. Some of the stuff on there is not what it could and should have been.&quot;

1998 saw the first live performances for the band, which had been organised prior to the release of &quot;Twilight in Olympus&quot;. Their first official show was in Osaka, Japan on June 23, 1998, which was soon followed by a world tour. Following the initial run of Japanese shows, bassist Miller and drummer Walling both left the band due to their unwillingness to tour. Original drummer Rullo rejoined the band, and the band recruited touring bassist Andy DeLuca before finding a permanent replacement in Michael LePond.

A compilation album, &quot;Prelude to the Millennium&quot;, was released by the end of 1998. It featured a re-recording of &quot;Masquerade&quot; from the first album &quot;Symphony X&quot;, featuring Russell Allen on vocals.

===&quot;V: The New Mythology Suite&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (1999−2005)===
The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;V: The New Mythology Suite&quot;, released in October 2000. The album would mark the band&#x27;s first worldwide release on a major record label, Inside Out, who had licensed Symphony X&#x27;s previous albums for European releases. The album was their first concept album, dealing with the myth of Atlantis. Romeo stated the band wanted to focus on the record as a whole rather than any one particular song. The album features touring staples such as &quot;Evolution (The Grand Design)&quot;, &quot;Communion and the Oracle&quot; and &quot;Egypt&quot;, and prominently features a number of classical music pieces.

The band supported the album with a European and South American tour shortly after its release. The band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Live on the Edge of Forever,&quot; was recorded on the European leg of the tour in Élysée Montmartre, Paris and was released in November 2001.

In 2002, the band released &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, an album prominently featuring a 24-minute-long musical interpretation of the Homeric epic, the Odyssey. The album was again released worldwide by Inside Out, and was the first album to be recorded entirely in Romeo&#x27;s home studio &quot;The Dungeon&quot;. The album was particularly successful for the band, again expanding their audience on an international scale. The band supported the album by touring North America with Blind Guardian, which marked some of the first North American shows for both bands.

In 2005 Symphony X was featured on Gigantour, a summer festival headlined by Megadeth with Dream Theater, Nevermore and Anthrax. Two Symphony X songs from the tour, &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Of Sins and Shadows&quot;, are featured on the Gigantour DVD and CD-set, released in September 2006.

===&quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (2006–2010)===

The band&#x27;s album &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, an album thematically inspired by John Milton&#x27;s epic poem of the same name, was recorded in Romeo&#x27;s studio throughout 2006. The recording process was delayed numerous times due to water damage in &quot;The Dungeon,&quot; as well as an extended touring cycle. The album finally released worldwide on June 26, 2007 through Inside Out. The album has darker musical themes, with use of heavy riffs and classical motifs. A limited number of albums from certain vendors contained a special DVD, which consists of footage of the band&#x27;s live performances.

&quot;Paradise Lost&quot; debuted at number 123 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in the United States, selling 6,300 copies in its first week. The record also debuted at number 1 on the Top Heatseekers Chart.

Following the release, the band embarked on a 14-month world tour, including a tour through all of Europe with Dream Theater in the fall of 2007. The band also revealed plans to perform in Japan and other Asian countries, as well as appear for the first time ever in Russia, India, and the Middle East.

Symphony X released their first music video for the song &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Kiss&quot; on July 28, 2007. It was followed by a video for &quot;Set the World on Fire&quot;, released on January 11, 2008. The band toured North and South America from October to November 2008, and toured Asia in February 2009.

===&quot;Iconoclast&quot; (2011–2013)===
On March 1, 2010, an update on the Symphony X official website announced that the band had recorded most of their next album, and that Romeo and Allen were working on lyrics; Romeo was getting ready to start tracking the album. The album&#x27;s name and lyrical concept were revealed on January 29, 2011 in an interview with Allen on Metal Messiah Radio: the follow-up to &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; will be titled &quot;Iconoclast&quot; and will have its lyrics centered around &quot;machines taking over everything and all this technology we put our society into pretty much being our demise.&quot; On February 25, 2011, Symphony X played the first show of their 2011 tour in Stuttgart, Germany, where they performed two songs from the upcoming &quot;Iconoclast&quot;: &quot;End of Innocence&quot; and &quot;Dehumanized&quot;. Some days later in Antwerp, Belgium, they debuted &quot;Heretic&quot;. During their show in London, England, the band played yet another new song titled &quot;Prometheus&quot;.

&quot;Iconoclast&quot; released in Europe on June 17 and in North America on June 21, 2011, the band&#x27;s first release through German label Nuclear Blast. The album was available as a Standard Edition as well as a 2-CD Digipack. &quot;Iconoclast&quot; debuted at number 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in the United States, selling more than 7,300 copies in its first week. The record also debuted at number 7 on the Top Hard Rock Chart, number 19 on the Top Rock Chart and number 13 on the Top Independent Chart. The album showcases the highest chart position and the most first-week sales in the band&#x27;s history up to that point.

On February 27, 2013, it was announced that drummer Jason Rullo had been admitted to hospital due to heart failure. Rullo spent a week in hospital before being released home to undergo a rehabilitation program that would take 3–6 months under doctors&#x27; care. John Macaluso joined the band on tour for their South American and European dates, giving Rullo time to recover.

===&quot;Underworld&quot; and band hiatus (2015–2019)===

The band began recording the drum tracks for their ninth studio album on September 9, 2014, and planned to release the complete recording by the spring of 2015. LePond stated they had ten songs written and that the album would contain either nine or all ten of them. He also stated all lyrics and instrumental tracks were composed and ready to be brought together, and that the album would be less heavy than &quot;Iconoclast&quot;: &quot;If I had to compare, I would say that it&#x27;s a combination of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; — something in there. It has a lot of classic Symphony X elements in it, which I think a lot of our fans were missing for a few years. So I think our fans will really like this one. It really just focuses on solid songwriting.&quot; As of December 11, 2014, recording of the drums, lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and bass were complete. With the keyboards, guitar solos, background vocals, and some miscellaneous odds and ends being done in the coming weeks. On April 10, 2015 the band announced the mixing and mastering of the new album was complete.

On May 18, 2015, the band announced the title of the album would be titled &quot;Underworld&quot;, and a release date of July 24 through Nuclear Blast. The first single from the album, &quot;Nevermore&quot;, premiered on May 22. The band released the second single, &quot;Without You&quot;, on June 19, which was made available for digital download. The band embarked on a world tour following the release of the album.

According to singer Russell Allen, the band entered a short hiatus during 2017 in which they did not perform, due in part to his commitment to Adrenaline Mob, although it was announced during a January 2018 interview with Metal Nation that the band had plans to get together in the following months and begin writing a follow-up to &quot;Underworld&quot;. On July 14, 2017, Adrenaline Mob was involved in a serious vehicular accident, which resulted in severe injuries for Allen and the death of the band&#x27;s bassist and their tour manager. In July 2018, according to Romeo, the band hoped to re-group and make another album, but also said that he was giving Allen some time and space after dealing with the aftermath of the accident, and also Allen&#x27;s touring commitments with Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

The band returned to the stage in May 2019 with a European tour. In June 2019, Romeo said the band were considering making their tenth album following the conclusion of their tour in August. In December 2019, the band announced a &quot;25th Anniversary&quot; North American tour would take place in May and June 2020. However, the shows would later be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Touring and upcoming tenth studio album (2020–present) ===

During bassist LePond&#x27;s May 2020 interview with Metal Nation when asked about plans for him and the band, he had confirmed that the band was ready to start writing the tenth studio album, a follow-up to their 2015 album, &quot;Underworld&quot; as soon as the virus slowed down, and that writing would begin in about &quot;a month or so&quot;.

Symphony X performed their &quot;25th Anniversary&quot; shows in South America and North America, in August 2021 and May 2022 respectively.

While promoting &quot;War of the Worlds, Pt. 2&quot; in early 2022, Romeo confirmed that writing for the next album had begun. Romeo stated &quot;we are working on it&quot;, noting the process &quot;feels a little slower than normal&quot; due to the band&#x27;s extended hiatus and inability to tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a November 2022 interview, Romeo reiterated that work was continuing but that the band had not yet settled on a theme or vision for the record.

In a 2024 interview with Ola Englund, Romeo again confirmed that the band have been working on new material between legs of their American and European tours. Romeo stated the band have finished writing and have moved on to song arrangement.

== Musical style ==
Symphony X&#x27;s music includes complex timings and odd meters while incorporating elements of heavy metal and progressive rock. Their early albums in particular contain strong neo-classical elements reminiscent of Yngwie Malmsteen, Randy Rhoads, and others. The band have been categorized as progressive metal, power metal, and neoclassical metal, though the band themselves dislike genre labels with Romeo stating they can be &quot;misleading sometimes ... at the core of it all we&#x27;re a metal band&quot;.

Symphony X&#x27;s music is often driven by a particular theme or concept. Romeo has stated that creating an album with a consistent theme helps the writing process, as the theme will drive the direction of the music. To date, &quot;V: The New Mythology Suite&quot; is the only concept album released by the band.

Symphony X is often compared to other progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater, Fates Warning, and Shadow Gallery.

==Solo projects==
Keyboardist Michael Pinnella released a solo album, entitled &quot;Enter by the Twelfth Gate&quot;, on October 12, 2004. Another solo album, &quot;Ascension&quot;, was released in 2014.

Vocalist Russell Allen&#x27;s solo debut, entitled &quot;Atomic Soul&quot;, was released in the summer of 2005. With this album, Allen took a different musical direction from that seen in his work with Symphony X. It was considered by many—including Allen himself—to be a hard rock album. Also in 2005, he recorded an album called &quot;The Battle&quot; with former Masterplan vocalist Jørn Lande under the moniker &quot;Allen/Lande&quot;. The two would later record follow-up albums entitled &quot;The Revenge&quot;, released May 11, 2007; &quot;The Showdown&quot;, released November 5, 2010; and &quot;The Great Divide&quot;, released October 21, 2014.

In early 2011, Russell Allen co-founded heavy metal supergroup Adrenaline Mob with guitarist Mike Orlando and drummer Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), who has since left the group. They have released three studio albums, &quot;Omertá&quot; (2012), &quot;Men of Honor&quot; (2014) and &quot;We the People&quot; (2017).

Bassist Michael LePond released his first solo album, &quot;Mike LePond&#x27;s Silent Assassins&quot; on September 26, 2014. It features guest performances from guitarist Mike Chlasciak (Halford, Testament), lead guitarist, drum producer and Symphony X bandmate Michael Romeo, and vocalist Alan Tecchio (Hades, Watchtower). LePond himself played bass and rhythm guitar.

Michael Romeo&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;War of the Worlds, Pt. 1&quot;, was released on July 27, 2018. The album features Rick Castellano on vocals, John DeServio on bass, and John Macaluso on drums. It was Romeo&#x27;s first solo album since &quot;The Dark Chapter&quot;, which was released in 1994. &quot;War of the Worlds, Pt. 2&quot; was released on March 25, 2022 with Dino Jelusick replacing Castellano on vocals.

Jason Rullo&#x27;s first album with new band 3 Rules, &quot;Rule of 3&quot;, was released in 2020. The band is composed of guitar player Ron Sanborn and bassist Artha Meadors.

<text>The Chicago metropolitan area, also referred to as Chicagoland, is the largest metropolitan statistical area in the U.S. state of Illinois, and the Midwest, containing the City of Chicago along with its surrounding suburbs and satellite cities. Encompassing 10,286 square mi (28,120 km2), the metropolitan area includes the city of Chicago, its suburbs and hinterland, that span 13 counties across northeast Illinois and northwest Indiana. The MSA had a 2020 census population of 9,618,502 and the combined statistical area, which spans 19 counties and additionally extends into southeast Wisconsin, had a population of nearly 10 million people. The Chicago area is the third-largest metropolitan area in the United States and the fourth-largest metropolitan area in North America (after Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles), and the largest in the Great Lakes megalopolis. Its urban area is one of the 40 largest in the world.

According to the 2020 census, the metropolitan&#x27;s population is approaching the 10 million mark. The metropolitan area has seen a substantial increase of Latin American residents on top of its already large Latino population, and the Asian American population also increased according to the 2020 Census. The metro area has a large number of White, Black, Latino, Asian, and Arab American residents, and also has Native American residents in the region, making the Chicago metropolitan area population truly diverse. The Chicago metropolitan area represents about 3 percent of the entire US population.

Chicagoland has one of the world&#x27;s largest and most diversified economies. With more than six million full and part-time employees, the Chicago metropolitan area is a key factor of the Illinois economy, as the state has an annual GDP of over $1 trillion. The Chicago metropolitan area generated an annual gross regional product (GRP) of approximately $700 billion in 2018. The region is home to more than 400 major corporate headquarters, including 31 in the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 such as McDonald&#x27;s, United, and Blue Cross Blue Shield. With many companies moving to Chicagoland, and many current companies expanding, the area ranked as the nation&#x27;s top metropolitan area for corporation relocations and expansions for nine consecutive years, the most consecutive years for any region in the country.

The Chicago area is home to a number of the nation&#x27;s leading research universities including the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, DePaul University, Loyola University, and the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). The University of Chicago and Northwestern University are consistently ranked as two of the best universities in the world.

There are many transportation options around the region. Chicagoland has three separate rail networks; the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Metra, and the South Shore Line. The CTA operates elevated and subway lines that run primarily throughout the city, Downtown Chicago, and into some suburbs. The CTA operates some of its rail lines 24 hours a day, every day of the year, nonstop service, making Chicago, New York City, and Copenhagen the only three cities in the world to offer some 24 hour rail service running nonstop, everyday throughout their city limits. The Metra commuter rail network runs numerous lines between Downtown Chicago and suburban/satellite cities, with one line stretching to Kenosha, Wisconsin, which is part of the Chicago metropolitan area. The interurban South Shore Line runs between Downtown Chicago and the northwest Indiana portion of the metropolitan area. In addition, Amtrak operates Union Station in Downtown Chicago as one of its largest rail hubs, with numerous lines radiating to and from the station.

CTA bus routes serve the city proper, with some service into the suburbs. Pace bus routes serve the suburbs, with some service into the city. In addition, numerous CTA bus routes operate 24 hours a day, nonstop.

==Definitions==
===Chicago Metropolitan statistical area===

The Chicago metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was originally designated by the United States Census Bureau in 1950. It comprised the Illinois counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will, along with Lake County in Indiana. As surrounding counties saw an increase in their population densities and the number of their residents employed within Cook County, they met Census criteria to be added to the MSA. The Chicago MSA, now defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as the Chicago–Naperville–Elgin, IL–IN–WI Metropolitan Statistical Area, is the third-largest MSA by population in the United States. The 2022 census estimate for the population of the MSA was 9,441,957.

The Chicago MSA is further subdivided into four metropolitan divisions. A breakdown of the county constituents and 2021 estimated populations of the four metropolitan divisions of the MSA are as follows:
Chicago–Naperville–Elgin, IL–IN–WI Metropolitan Statistical Area (9,509,934)
* &quot;Chicago–Naperville–Schaumburg, IL Metropolitan Division&quot; (7,159,394)
** Cook County, Illinois (5,173,146)
** DuPage County, Illinois (924,885)
** Grundy County, Illinois (52,989)
** McHenry County, Illinois (311,122)
** Will County, Illinois (697,252)
* &quot;Elgin, IL Metropolitan Division&quot; (750,869)
** DeKalb County, Illinois (100,414)
** Kane County, Illinois (515,588)
** Kendall County, Illinois (134,867)
* &quot;Lake County, IL Metropolitan Division&quot; (711,239)
** Lake County, Illinois (711,239)
* &quot;Lake County–Porter County–Jasper County, IN Metropolitan Division&quot; (719,700)
** Jasper County, Indiana (33,091)
** Lake County, Indiana (498,558)
** Newton County, Indiana (13,808)
** Porter County, Indiana (174,243)
===Combined statistical area===
The OMB also defines a slightly larger region as a combined statistical area (CSA). The Chicago–Naperville, IL–IN–WI Combined Statistical Area combines the following core-based statistical areas, listed with their 2021 estimated populations. The combined statistical area as a whole had a population of 9,806,184 as of 2022.

* &quot;Chicago–Naperville–Elgin, IL–IN–WI metropolitan statistical area&quot; (9,509,934)
* &quot;Kankakee, IL metropolitan statistical area&quot; (106,601)
** Kankakee County, Illinois (106,601)
* &quot;Michigan City–La Porte, IN metropolitan statistical area&quot; (112,390)
** LaPorte County, Indiana (112,390)
* &quot;Ottawa, IL micropolitan statistical area&quot; (147,414)
** Bureau County, Illinois (32,883)
** LaSalle County, Illinois (108,965)
** Putnam County, Illinois (5,566)

===United Nations&#x27; Chicago urban agglomeration===
The Chicago urban agglomeration, according to the United Nations &quot;World Urbanization Prospects&quot; report (2023 revision), lists a population of 8,937,000. The term &quot;urban agglomeration&quot; refers to the population contained within the contours of a contiguous territory inhabited at urban density levels. It usually incorporates the population in a city, plus that in the contiguous urban, or built-up area.

===Chicagoland===
Chicagoland is an informal name for the Chicago metropolitan area. The term &quot;Chicagoland&quot; has no official definition, and the region is often considered to include areas beyond the corresponding MSA, as well as portions of the greater CSA.

Colonel Robert R. McCormick, editor and publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, usually gets credit for placing the term in common use. McCormick&#x27;s conception of Chicagoland stretched all the way to nearby parts of four states (Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa). The first usage was in the &quot;Tribune&quot;&#x27;s July 27, 1926, front page headline, &quot;Chicagoland&#x27;s Shrines: A Tour of Discoveries&quot;, for an article by reporter James O&#x27;Donnell Bennett. He stated that Chicagoland comprised everything in a radius in every direction and reported on many different places in the area. The &quot;Tribune&quot; was the dominant newspaper in a vast area stretching to the west of the city, and that hinterland was closely tied to the metropolis by rail lines and commercial links.

Today, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s usage includes the city of Chicago, the rest of Cook County, eight nearby Illinois counties (Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee), and the two Indiana counties of Lake and Porter. Illinois Department of Tourism literature uses &quot;Chicagoland&quot; for suburbs in Cook, Lake, DuPage, Kane, and Will counties, treating the city separately. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce defines it as all of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties.

In addition, company marketing programs such as Construction Data Company&#x27;s &quot;Chicago and Vicinity&quot; region and the Chicago Automobile Trade Association&#x27;s &quot;Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana&quot; advertising campaign are directed at the MSA itself, as well as LaSalle, Winnebago (Rockford), Boone, and Ogle counties in Illinois, in addition to Jasper, Newton, and La Porte counties in Indiana and Kenosha, Racine, and Walworth counties in Wisconsin, and even as far northeast as Berrien County, Michigan. The region is part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis, containing an estimated 54 million people.

===Collar counties===
The term &quot;collar counties&quot; is a colloquialism for the five counties (DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will) of Illinois that border Chicago&#x27;s Cook County. After Cook County, they are also the next five most populous counties in the state. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Chicago&quot;, there is no specifically known origin of the phrase, but it has been commonly used among policy makers, urban planners, and in the media. However, it also notes that as growth has spread beyond these counties, it may have lost some of its usefulness.

===Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning===
Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) is an Illinois state agency responsible for transportation infrastructure, land use, and long-term economic development planning for the areas under its jurisdiction within Illinois. The planning area has a population of over 8 million, which includes the following locations in Illinois:

* Cook County
* DuPage County
* Kane County
* Kendall County
* Lake County
* McHenry County
* Will County

==Geography and environment==
The city of Chicago lies in the Chicago Plain, a flat and broad area characterized by little topographical relief. The few low hills are sand ridges. North of the Chicago Plain, steep bluffs and ravines run alongside Lake Michigan.

Along the southern shore of the Chicago Plain, sand dunes run alongside the lake. The tallest dunes reach up to near and are found in Indiana Dunes National Park. Surrounding the low plain are bands of moraines in the south and west suburbs. These areas are higher and hillier than the Chicago Plain. A continental divide, separating the Mississippi River watershed from that of the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, runs through the Chicago area.

A 2012 survey of the urban trees and forests in the seven county Illinois section of the Chicago area found that 21% of the land is covered by the tree and shrub canopy, made up of about 157,142,000 trees. The five most common tree species are buckthorn, green ash, boxelder, black cherry, and American elm. These resources perform important functions in carbon storage, water recycling, and energy saving.

==Demographics==
As of 2022, the metropolitan area had a population of 9,442,159. The population density was 1,312.3 per square mile.
The racial makeup was 50.1% Non-Hispanic White, 23.4% were Hispanic, 15.5% were Non-Hispanic African Americans, 7.2% were Asian, 0.1% were Non-Hispanic Native American, 0.4% identified as “some other race,” and 3.2% were non-Hispanic multiracial.

According to 2022 estimates from the American Community Survey, the largest ancestries in the Chicago metro area were Mexican (18%), African (17.7%), German (12.8%), Irish (9.9%), Polish (8%), Italian (5.9%), English (5.2%), Indian (2.7%), Puerto Rican (2.3%), Filipino (1.7%), Swedish (1.5%), and Chinese (1.4%). 

The suburbs, surrounded by easily annexed flat ground, have been expanding at a tremendous rate since the early 1960s. Aurora, Elgin, Joliet, and Naperville are noteworthy for being four of the few boomburbs outside the Sun Belt, West Coast and Mountain States regions, and exurban Kendall County ranked as the fastest-growing county (among counties with a population greater than 10,000) in the United States between the years 2000 and 2007.

Settlement patterns in the Chicago metropolitan area tend to follow those in the city proper: the northern and northwestern suburbs are generally affluent and upper-middle class, while the southern suburbs (sometimes known as Chicago Southland) have somewhat lower median incomes and a cost of living, with the exception being the southwest suburbs which contain many upper-middle class areas. Another exception to this is the West Side, which has a somewhat lower median income, but the western suburbs contain many affluent and upper-middle class areas. According to the 2000 Census, DuPage County as a whole had the highest median household income of any county in the Midwestern United States, although there are individual cities and towns in other surrounding counties in the metro that have even higher median incomes.

According to 2022 estimates from the U.S. Census, poverty rates of the largest counties from least poverty to most are as follows: McHenry 4.0%, Dupage 6.7%, Will 6.9%, Kane 7.8%, Lake 8.0%, and Cook 13.6%. However, Cook County, which contains luxury high rises and expensive houses in sections of the city and expensive houses along the waterfront in the North Shore area, would also have the highest percentage of expensive homes in the region.

In an in-depth historical analysis, Keating (2004, 2005) examined the origins of 233 settlements that by 1900 had become suburbs or city neighborhoods of the Chicago metropolitan area. The settlements began as farm centers (41%), industrial towns (30%), residential railroad suburbs (15%), and recreational/institutional centers (13%). Although relations between the different settlement types were at times contentious, there also was cooperation in such undertakings as the construction of high schools.

==Population==
As the Chicago metropolitan area has grown, more counties have been partly or totally assimilated with the taking of each decennial census.

Counties highlighted in gray were not included in the MSA for that census.

Within the boundary of the 16-county Chicago Combined Statistical Area lies the Chicago urban area, as well as 26 smaller urban areas. Some of the urban areas below may partially cross into other statistical areas. Only those situated primarily within the Chicago combined statistical area are listed here.

==Economy==


The Chicago metropolitan area is home to the corporate headquarters of 57 Fortune 1000 companies, including AbbVie Inc., Allstate, Kraft Heinz, McDonald&#x27;s, Mondelez International, Motorola, United Airlines, Walgreens, and more. The Chicago area also headquarters a wide variety of global financial institutions including Citadel LLC, Discover Financial Services, Morningstar, Inc., CNA Financial, and more. Chicago is home to the largest futures exchange in the world, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In March 2008, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced its acquisition of NYMEX Holdings Inc, the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange. CME&#x27;S acquisition of NYMEX was completed in August 2008.

A key piece of infrastructure for several generations was the Union Stock Yards of Chicago, which from 1865 until 1971 penned and slaughtered millions of cattle and hogs into standardized cuts of beef and pork. This prompted poet Carl Sandburg to describe Chicago as the &quot;Hog Butcher for the World&quot;.

The Chicago area, meanwhile, began to produce significant quantities of telecommunications gear, electronics, steel, crude oil derivatives, automobiles, and industrial capital goods.

By the early 2000s, Illinois&#x27; economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, logistics, and health care. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois&#x27;s earlier economies. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global derivatives, had begun its life as an agricultural futures market.

In 2007, the area ranked first among U.S. metro areas in the number of new and expanded corporate facilities. It ranked third in 2008, behind the Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown and Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan areas, and ranked second behind the New York metropolitan area in 2009.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; summarized the Chicago area&#x27;s economy in November 2006 with the comment that &quot;Chicago has survived by repeatedly reinventing itself.&quot;

==Education==

Elementary and secondary education within the Chicago metropolitan area is provided by dozens of different school districts, of which by far the largest is the Chicago Public Schools with 400,000 students. Numerous private and religious school systems are also found in the region, as well as a growing number of charter schools. Racial inequalities in education in the region remain widespread, often breaking along district boundaries; for instance, educational prospects vary widely for students in the Chicago Public Schools compared to those in some neighboring suburban schools.

Historically, the Chicago metropolitan area has been at the center of a number of national educational movements, from the free-flowing Winnetka Plan to the regimented Taylorism of the Gary Plan. In higher education, University of Chicago founder William Rainey Harper was a leading early advocate of the junior college movement; Joliet Junior College is the nation&#x27;s oldest continuously operating junior college today. Later U of C president Robert Maynard Hutchins was central to the Great Books movement, and programs of dialogic education arising from that legacy can be found today at the U of C, at Shimer College, and in the City Colleges of Chicago and Oakton College in the Northwest suburbs.

==Area codes==
From 1947 until 1988, the Illinois portion of the Chicago metro area was served by a single area code, 312, which abutted the 815 area code. In 1988 the 708 area code was introduced and the 312 area code became exclusive to the city of Chicago.

It became common to call suburbanites &quot;708&#x27;ers&quot;, in reference to their area code.

The 708 area code was partitioned in 1996 into three area codes, serving different portions of the metro area: 630, 708, and 847.

At the same time that the 708 area code was running out of phone numbers, the 312 area code in Chicago was also exhausting its supply of available numbers. As a result, the city of Chicago was divided into two area codes, 312 and 773. Rather than divide the city by a north–south area code, the central business district retained the 312 area code, while the remainder of the city took the new 773 code.

In 2002, the 847 area code was supplemented with the overlay area code 224. In February 2007, the 815 area code (serving outlying portions of the metro area) was supplemented with the overlay area code 779. In October 2007, the overlay area code 331 was implemented to supplement the 630 area with additional numbers.

Plans are in place for overlay codes in the 708, 773, and 312 regions as those area codes become exhausted in the future.
* 312 Chicago - City (The Loop and central neighborhoods, e.g. the Near North Side)
* 773 Chicago - City (Everywhere else within the city limits, excluding central area)
* 872 Chicago - City (overlay for 312 &amp; 773, effective November 7, 2009)
* 847/224 (North and Northwest Suburbs)
* 630/331 (Outer Western Suburbs)
* 708 (South and Near West Suburbs)
* 815/779 (Rockford &amp; Joliet: Far Northwest/Southwest Suburbs)
* 219 (Northwest Indiana)
* 574 (North-central Indiana)
* 262 (Southeast Wisconsin surrounding Milwaukee County)

===Proposed overlays===
* 464 overlay for 708 (January 21, 2022, rollout)

<text>In signal processing, undersampling or bandpass sampling is a technique where one samples a bandpass-filtered signal at a sample rate below its Nyquist rate (twice the upper cutoff frequency), but is still able to reconstruct the signal.

When one undersamples a bandpass signal, the samples are indistinguishable from the samples of a low-frequency alias of the high-frequency signal. Such sampling is also known as bandpass sampling, harmonic sampling, IF sampling, and direct IF-to-digital conversion.

== Description ==

The Fourier transforms of real-valued functions are symmetrical around the 0 Hz axis. After sampling, only a periodic summation of the Fourier transform (called discrete-time Fourier transform) is still available. The individual frequency-shifted copies of the original transform are called &quot;aliases&quot;. The frequency offset between adjacent aliases is the sampling-rate, denoted by &quot;fs&quot;. When the aliases are mutually exclusive (spectrally), the original transform and the original continuous function, or a frequency-shifted version of it (if desired), can be recovered from the samples. The first and third graphs of Figure 1 depict a baseband spectrum before and after being sampled at a rate that completely separates the aliases.

The second graph of Figure 1 depicts the frequency profile of a bandpass function occupying the band (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;+&quot;B&quot;) (shaded blue) and its mirror image (shaded beige). The condition for a non-destructive sample rate is that the aliases of both bands do not overlap when shifted by all integer multiples of &quot;fs&quot;. The fourth graph depicts the spectral result of sampling at the same rate as the baseband function. The rate was chosen by finding the lowest rate that is an integer sub-multiple of &quot;A&quot; and also satisfies the baseband Nyquist criterion: &quot;fs&quot; &gt; 2&quot;B&quot;.  Consequently, the bandpass function has effectively been converted to baseband. All the other rates that avoid overlap are given by these more general criteria, where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;A&quot;+&quot;B&quot; are replaced by &quot;fL&quot; and &quot;fH&quot;, respectively:
:formula_1, for any integer &quot;n&quot; satisfying: formula_2

The highest &quot;n&quot; for which the condition is satisfied leads to the lowest possible sampling rates.

Important signals of this sort include a radio&#x27;s intermediate-frequency (IF), radio-frequency (RF) signal, and the individual &quot;channels&quot; of a filter bank.

If &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, then the conditions result in what is sometimes referred to as &quot;undersampling&quot;, &quot;bandpass sampling&quot;, or using a sampling rate less than the Nyquist rate (2&quot;fH&quot;). For the case of a given sampling frequency, simpler formulae for the constraints on the signal&#x27;s spectral band are given below.


:Example: Consider FM radio to illustrate the idea of undersampling.

:In the US, FM radio operates on the frequency band from &quot;fL&quot; = 88 MHz to &quot;fH&quot; = 108 MHz. The bandwidth is given by

::formula_3

:The sampling conditions are satisfied for
::formula_4

:Therefore, &quot;n&quot; can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

:The value &quot;n&quot; = 5 gives the lowest sampling frequencies interval formula_5 and this is a scenario of undersampling. In this case, the signal spectrum fits between 2 and 2.5 times the sampling rate (higher than 86.4–88 MHz but lower than 108–110 MHz).

:A lower value of &quot;n&quot; will also lead to a useful sampling rate. For example, using &quot;n&quot; = 4, the FM band spectrum fits easily between 1.5 and 2.0 times the sampling rate, for a sampling rate near 56 MHz (multiples of the Nyquist frequency being 28, 56, 84, 112, etc.). See the illustrations at the right.

:When undersampling a real-world signal, the sampling circuit must be fast enough to capture the highest signal frequency of interest. Theoretically, each sample should be taken during an infinitesimally short interval, but this is not practically feasible. Instead, the sampling of the signal should be made in a short enough interval that it can represent the instantaneous value of the signal with the highest frequency. This means that in the FM radio example above, the sampling circuit must be able to capture a signal with a frequency of 108 MHz, not 43.2 MHz. Thus, the sampling frequency may be only a little bit greater than 43.2 MHz, but the input bandwidth of the system must be at least 108 MHz. Similarly, the accuracy of the sampling timing, or aperture uncertainty of the sampler, frequently the analog-to-digital converter, must be appropriate for the frequencies being sampled 108MHz, not the lower sample rate.

:If the sampling theorem is interpreted as requiring twice the highest frequency, then the required sampling rate would be assumed to be greater than the &quot;Nyquist rate&quot; 216 MHz. While this does satisfy the last condition on the sampling rate, it is grossly oversampled.

:Note that if a band is sampled with &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, then a band-pass filter is required for the anti-aliasing filter, instead of a lowpass filter.

As we have seen, the normal baseband condition for reversible sampling is that &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = 0 outside the interval:
  formula_6

and the reconstructive interpolation function, or lowpass filter impulse response, is  formula_7

To accommodate undersampling, the bandpass condition is that &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = 0 outside the union of open positive and negative frequency bands
::formula_8 for some positive integer formula_9.
:: which includes the normal baseband condition as case &quot;n&quot; = 1 (except that where the intervals come together at 0 frequency, they can be closed).

The corresponding interpolation function is the bandpass filter given by this difference of lowpass impulse responses:

::formula_10.

On the other hand, reconstruction is not usually the goal with sampled IF or RF signals. Rather, the sample sequence can be treated as ordinary samples of the signal frequency-shifted to near baseband, and digital demodulation can proceed on that basis, recognizing the spectrum mirroring when &quot;n&quot; is even.

Further generalizations of undersampling for the case of signals with multiple bands are possible, and signals over multidimensional domains (space or space-time) and have been worked out in detail by Igor Kluvánek.

<text>The Hoh or Chalá·at (&quot;Those-Who-Live-on-the-Hoh River&quot; or &quot;People of the Hoh River&quot;) are a Native American tribe in western Washington state in the United States. The tribe lives near the Pacific Coast of Washington on the Olympic Peninsula. The Hoh moved onto the Hoh Indian Reservation at the mouth of the Hoh River, on the Pacific Coast of Jefferson County, after the signing of the Quinault Treaty on July 1, 1855. The reservation has a land area of and a 2000 census resident population of 102 persons, 81 of whom were Native Americans. It lies about halfway between its nearest outside communities of Forks, to its north, and Queets (on the Quinault Indian Reservation), to its south. The river is central to their culture. The main resources they used included cedar trees, salmon, and the nearby vegetation. They also traded and bartered with other tribes closer to Eastern Washington, near the Plateaus and Great Plains.

==Name==
The name of the Hoh River, and the Hoh who were named after it, is derived from the Quinault language name for the river, húxʷ.

The Hoh call themselves Chalá·at or Chalat&#x27; (′People of the southern river, i.e. Hoh River′) after their name for the Hoh River Cha’lak’at’sit or Chalak&#x27;ac&#x27;it, which means the &quot;southern river&quot;.

==History==
In aboriginal times, there was nothing secluded about the Hoh Watershed, even its upper reaches. No less than &quot;seven permanent settlements&quot; were situated along the banks of the Hoh, most with a fish trap. The river served not only as a riverine thoroughfare leading to their fishing sites and their hunting, trapping, and foraging grounds, it was also the nursery of the salmon and home of freshwater fishes that they harvested as part of their annual cycle. The watershed included the sites of the burials of their ancestors, the hidden locations of their empowering guardian spirits, and the family campgrounds and upstream summer-homesites near resource gathering areas that were heritable family property. Besides that, there were named landmarks, sites associated with ritual and mythic occurrences, and riverside trails.
The Hoh (Chalá·at) people refer to both their traditional lands and their reservation as ChalAt’i’lo t’sikAti, (′the land belonging to the people who live at the Hoh River′).

The lifestyle of the Hoh, like many Northwest Coast tribes, involved the fishing of salmon. They also hunted large marine mammals off the coast, including seals, sea lions, and whales, for food and other uses. The tribe&#x27;s population declined significantly following contact with European American explorers in the 19th century, which brought a smallpox epidemic. A census conducted in 1901 counted 64 total members.

Though the Hoh (Chalá·at) are today considered to be a band of the Quileute tribe, the original Hoh language was actually the Quinault language and they were related to the Quinault. After intermarriage with the Quileute, the Hoh became a bilingual tribe, speaking both Quileute and Quinault, until the Quileute language was favored. Today, however, all three tribes have overwhelmingly adopted American English as their home language.

==Ethnobotany==
The Hoh make use of Vaccinium myrtilloides. They eat the fruit raw, stew the berries and make them into a sauce, and can the berries and use them as winter food.

==Hoh Indian Reservation==

The Hoh Indian Reservation was established on September 11, 1893, by an executive order signed by President Grover Cleveland. The Hoh had originally been assigned to the Quinault Indian Reservation per the terms of the 1855 Quinault Treaty, which was not signed with their knowledge. The reservation lies on the Lower Hoh River and includes a co-managed fishery for salmon.

<doc id="326469" wikidata="Q210752" url="?curid=326469" title="Didache">
<text>The Didache (; ), also known as The Lord&#x27;s Teaching Through the Twelve Apostles to the Nations (), is a brief anonymous early Christian treatise (ancient church order) written in Koine Greek, dated by modern scholars to the first or (less commonly) second century AD.

The first line of this treatise is: &quot;The teaching of the Lord to the Gentiles (or Nations) by the twelve apostles&quot;. The text, parts of which constitute the oldest extant written catechism, has three main sections dealing with Christian ethics, rituals such as baptism and Eucharist, and Church organization. The opening chapters describe the virtuous Way of Life and the wicked Way of Death. The Lord&#x27;s Prayer is included in full. Baptism is by immersion, or by affusion if immersion is not practical. Fasting is ordered for Wednesdays and Fridays. Two primitive Eucharistic prayers are given. Church organization was at an early stage of development. Itinerant apostles and prophets are important, serving as &quot;chief priests&quot; and possibly celebrating the Eucharist; meanwhile, local bishops and deacons also have authority and seem to be taking the place of the itinerant ministry.

The &quot;Didache&quot; is considered the first example of the genre of Church Orders. It reveals how Jewish Christians saw themselves and how they adapted their practice for Gentile Christians. It is similar in several ways to the Gospel of Matthew, perhaps because both texts originated in similar communities. The opening chapters, which also appear in other early Christian texts like the Epistle of Barnabas, are likely derived from an earlier Jewish source.

The &quot;Didache&quot; is considered part of the group of second-generation Christian writings known as the Apostolic Fathers. The work was considered by some Church Fathers to be a part of the New Testament, while being rejected by others as spurious or non-canonical. In the end, it was not accepted into the New Testament canon. However, works which draw directly or indirectly from the &quot;Didache&quot; include the , the &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; and the Ethiopic Didascalia, the latter of which is included in the broader canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

Lost for centuries, a Greek manuscript of the &quot;Didache&quot; was rediscovered in 1873 by Philotheos Bryennios, Metropolitan of Nicomedia, in the Codex Hierosolymitanus, a compilation of texts of the Apostolic Fathers found in the Jerusalem Monastery of the Most Holy Sepulchre in Constantinople. A Latin version of the first five chapters was discovered in 1900 by J. Schlecht.
==Date, composition and modern translations==

Many English and American scholars once dated the text to the early second century, a view still held by some today, but most scholars now assign the &quot;Didache&quot; to the first century. The document is a composite work, and the discovery of the &quot;Community Rule&quot; among the Dead Sea Scrolls, has provided evidence of development over a considerable period, beginning as a Jewish catechetical work which was then developed into a church manual.

Two uncial fragments containing Greek text of the &quot;Didache&quot; (verses 1:3c–4a; 2:7–3:2) were found among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (no. 1782) and are now in the collection of the Bodleian Art, Archaeology and Ancient World Library in Oxford. Apart from these fragments, the Greek text of the &quot;Didache&quot; has only survived in a single manuscript, the Codex Hierosolymitanus. Dating the document is thus made difficult both by the lack of hard evidence and its composite character. The &quot;Didache&quot; may have been compiled in its present form as late as 150, although a date closer to the end of the first century seems more probable to many.

The teaching is an anonymous pastoral manual which Aaron Milavec states &quot;reveals more about how Jewish-Christians saw themselves and how they adapted their Judaism for gentiles than any other book in the Christian Scriptures&quot;. The Two Ways section is likely based on an earlier Jewish source. The community that produced the &quot;Didache&quot; could have been based in Syria, as it addressed the gentiles but from a Judaic perspective, at some remove from Jerusalem, and shows no evidence of Pauline influence. Alan Garrow claims that its earliest layer may have originated in the decree issued by the Council of Jerusalem in 49–50, that is, by the Jerusalem assembly under James, brother of Jesus.

The text was lost, but scholars knew of it through the writing of later church fathers, some of whom had drawn heavily on it. In 1873 in Constantinople (now Istanbul), metropolitan Philotheos Bryennios found a Greek copy of the &quot;Didache&quot;, written in 1056, and he published it in 1883. Hitchcock and Brown produced the first English translation in March 1884. Adolf von Harnack produced the first German translation in 1884, and Paul Sabatier produced the first French translation and commentary in 1885.

==Early references==
The &quot;Didache&quot; is mentioned by Eusebius () as the Teachings of the Apostles along with other books he considered non-canonical:

Athanasius of Alexandria (367) and Tyrannius Rufinus () list the &quot;Didache&quot; among apocrypha. Rufinus gives the curious alternative title &quot;Judgment of Peter.&quot; It is rejected by Nikephoros I of Constantinople (), pseudo-Anastasius, and the &quot;Synopsis of Holy Scripture&quot; and the &quot;Catalogue of the Sixty Canonical Books&quot;. It is accepted by the Apostolic Constitutions, Canon 85, John of Damascus, and in Orthodox Tewahedo churches. The by an imitator of Cyprian quotes it by name. Unacknowledged citations are widespread, if less certain. The section &quot;Two Ways&quot; shares the same language with the Epistle of Barnabas, chapters 18–20, sometimes word for word, added to, dislocated, or abridged, and &quot;Barnabas&quot; iv, 9 either derives from &quot;Didache&quot;, 16, 2–3, or vice versa. There can also be seen many similarities to the Epistles of both Polycarp and Ignatius of Antioch. &quot;The Shepherd of Hermas&quot; seems to reflect it, and Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen also seem to use the work, and so in the West do Optatus and the &quot;Gesta apud Zenophilum&quot;. The are founded upon the &quot;Didache&quot;. The &quot;Apostolic Church-Ordinance&quot; used a part and the Apostolic Constitutions embody the . There are echoes in Justin Martyr, Tatian, Theophilus of Antioch, Cyprian, and Lactantius.

==Contents==
The &quot;Didache&quot; is a relatively short text with only some 2,300 words. The contents may be divided into four parts, which most scholars agree were combined from separate sources by a later redactor: the first is the &quot;Two Ways&quot;, the Way of Life and the Way of Death (chapters 1–6); the second part is a ritual dealing with baptism, fasting, and Communion (chapters 7–10); the third speaks of the ministry and how to treat apostles, prophets, bishops, and deacons (chapters 11–15); and the final section (chapter 16) is a prophecy of the Antichrist and the Second Coming.

===Title===
The manuscript is commonly referred to as the &quot;Didache&quot;. This is short for the header found on the document and the title used by the Church Fathers, &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Teaching of the Twelve Apostles&quot;. A fuller title or subtitle is also found next in the manuscript, &quot;The Teaching of the Lord to the Gentiles by the Twelve Apostles&quot;.

===Description===
Willy Rordorf considered the first five chapters as &quot;essentially Jewish, but the Christian community was able to use it&quot; by adding the &quot;evangelical section&quot;. The title &#x27;Lord&#x27; in the &quot;Didache&quot; is reserved usually for &quot;Lord God&quot;, while Jesus is called &quot;the servant&quot; of the Father (9:2&quot;f&quot;.; 10:2&quot;f&quot;.). Baptism was practiced &quot;in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&quot; Scholars generally agree that 9:5, which speaks of baptism &quot;in the name of the Lord&quot;, represents an earlier tradition that was gradually replaced by a trinity of names.&quot; A similarity with Acts 3 is noted by Aaron Milavec: both see Jesus as &quot;the servant (pais) of God&quot;. The community is presented as &quot;awaiting the kingdom from the Father as entirely a future event&quot;.

===The Two Ways===
The first section (Chapters 1–6) begins: &quot;There are two ways, one of life and one of death, and there is a great difference between these two ways.&quot;

Apostolic Fathers (1992) notes:
The closest parallels in the use of the Two Ways doctrine are found among the Essene Jews at the Dead Sea Scrolls community. The Qumran community included a Two Ways teaching in its founding Charter, The Community Rule.

Throughout the Two Ways there are many Old Testament quotes shared with the Gospels, and many theological similarities, but Jesus is never mentioned by name. The first chapter opens with the Shema (&quot;you shall love God&quot;), the Great Commandment (&quot;your neighbor as yourself&quot;), and the Golden Rule in the negative form. Then come short extracts in common with the Sermon on the Mount, together with a curious passage on giving and receiving, which is also cited with variations in &quot;Shepherd of Hermas&quot; (Mand., ii, 4–6). The Latin omits 1:3–6 and 2:1, and these sections have no parallel in Epistle of Barnabas; therefore, they may be a later addition, suggesting Hermas and the present text of the &quot;Didache&quot; may have used a common source, or one may have relied on the other. Chapter 2 contains the commandments against murder, adultery, corrupting boys, sexual promiscuity, theft, magic, sorcery, abortion, infanticide, coveting, perjury, false testimony, speaking evil, holding grudges, being double-minded, not acting as one speaks, greed, avarice, hypocrisy, maliciousness, arrogance, plotting evil against neighbors, hate, narcissism and expansions on these generally, with references to the words of Jesus. Chapter 3 attempts to explain how one vice leads to another: anger to murder, concupiscence to adultery, and so forth. The whole chapter is excluded in Barnabas. A number of precepts are added in chapter 4, which ends: &quot;This is the Way of Life.&quot; Verse 13 states that one must not forsake the Lord&#x27;s commandments, neither adding nor subtracting (see also Deuteronomy 4:2, 12:32). The Way of Death (chapter 5) is a list of vices to be avoided. Chapter 6 exhorts to the keeping in the Way of this Teaching:

The &quot;Didache&quot;, like , does not give an absolute prohibition on eating meat which has been offered to idols, but merely advises being careful. Comparable to the &quot;Didache&quot; is the &quot;let him eat herbs&quot; of Paul of Tarsus as a hyperbolical expression like &quot;I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother&quot;, thus giving no support to the notion of vegetarianism in the Early Church. John Chapman in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1908) states that the &quot;Didache&quot; is referring to Jewish meats. The Latin version substitutes for chapter 6 a similar close, omitting all reference to meats and to , and concluding with (&#x27;by our lord Jesus Christ[...] for ever and ever, amen&#x27;). This is the end of the translation. This suggests the translator lived at a day when idolatry had disappeared, and when the remainder of the &quot;Didache&quot; was out of date. There would be no other such reason for omitting chapter 1, 3–6, so these chapters were presumably not in the copy used by the translator.

===Vice and virtue lists===
Vice lists, which are common appearances in Paul&#x27;s epistles, were relatively unusual within ancient Judaism of the Old Testament times. Within the Gospels, Jesus&#x27; structure of teaching the Beatitudes is often dependent upon the Law and the Prophets. At times, however, Jesus expressed such vice lists, such as in Mark 7:20–23. Paul&#x27;s vice and virtue lists could bear more influence from the Hellenistic-Jewish influences of Philo (20 BC–50 AD) and other writers of the intertestamental period.

The way of death and the &quot;grave sin&quot;, which are forbidden, is reminiscent of the various &quot;vice lists&quot; found in the Pauline Epistles, which warn against engaging in certain behaviours if one wants to enter the Kingdom of God. Contrasting what Paul wrote in , , and what was written in with &quot;Didache 2&quot; displays a certain commonality with one another, almost with the same warnings and words, except for one line: &quot;thou shalt not corrupt boys&quot;. Whereas Paul uses the compound word (), a hapax legomenon literally meaning &#x27;male-bedder&#x27;, based on the Greek words for &#x27;male&#x27; and &#x27;lie with&#x27; found in the Septuagint translation of Leviticus 18:22, the Didache uses a word translated as &#x27;child corrupter&#x27; () which is likewise used in the Epistle of Barnabas.

=== Rituals ===
====Baptism====
The second part (chapters 7 to 10) begins with an instruction on baptism, the sacramental rite that admits someone into the Christian Church. Baptism is to be conferred &quot;in the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot; with triple immersion in &quot;living water&quot; (that is, flowing water, probably in a stream). If this is not practical, baptism in cold or even warm water is acceptable. If the water is insufficient for immersion, it may be poured three times on the head (affusion). The baptized and the baptizer, and, if possible, anyone else attending the ritual should fast for one or two days beforehand.

The New Testament is rich in metaphors for baptism but offers few details about the practice itself, not even whether the candidates professed their faith in a formula. The &quot;Didache&quot; is the oldest extra-biblical source for information about baptism, but it, too lacks these details. The Two Ways section of the &quot;Didache&quot; is presumably the sort of ethical instruction that catechumens (students) received in preparation for baptism.

====Fasting====
Chapter 8 suggests that fasts are not to be on the second day and on the fifth day &quot;with the hypocrites&quot;, but on the fourth day and on the preparation day. Fasting Wednesday and Friday plus worshiping on the Lord&#x27;s day constituted the Christian week. Nor must Christians pray with their Judaic brethren; instead they shall say the Lord&#x27;s Prayer three times a day. The text of the prayer is not identical to the version in the Gospel of Matthew, and it is given with the doxology &quot;for Yours is the power and the glory forever.&quot; This doxology derives from 1 Chronicles 29:11–13; Bruce M. Metzger held that the early church added it to the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, creating the current Matthew reading.

====Daily prayer====
The &quot;Didache&quot; provides one of the few clues historians have in reconstructing the daily prayer practice among Christians before the 300s. It instructs Christians to pray the &quot;Our Father&quot; three times a day but does not specify times to pray. Recalling the version of Matthew 6:9–13, it affirms &quot;you must not pray like the hypocrites, but you should pray as follows.&quot; Other early sources speak of two-fold, three-fold, and five-fold daily prayers.

====Eucharist====
The &quot;Didache&quot; includes two primitive and unusual prayers for the Eucharist (&quot;thanksgiving&quot;), which is the central act of Christian worship. It is the earliest text to refer to this rite as the Eucharist.

Chapter 9 begins:
And concerning the broken bread:
The &quot;Didache&quot; basically describes the same ritual as the one that took place in Corinth. As with Paul&#x27;s First Letter to the Corinthians, the &quot;Didache&quot; confirms that the Lord&#x27;s supper was literally a meal, probably taking place in a &quot;house church&quot;. The order of cup and bread differs both from present-day Christian practice and from that in the New Testament accounts of the Last Supper, of which, again unlike almost all present-day Eucharistic celebrations, the &quot;Didache&quot; makes no mention.
Chapter 10 gives a thanksgiving after a meal. The contents of the meal are not indicated: chapter 9 does not exclude other elements as well that the cup and bread, which are the only ones it mentions, and chapter 10, whether it was originally a separate document or continues immediately the account in chapter 9, mentions no particular elements, not even wine and bread. Instead it speaks of the &quot;spiritual food and drink and life eternal through Thy Servant&quot; that it distinguishes from the &quot;food and drink (given) to men for enjoyment that they might give thanks to (God)&quot;. After a doxology, as before, come the apocalyptic exclamations: &quot;Let grace come, and let this world pass away. Hosanna to the God (Son) of David! If any one is holy, let him come; if any one is not so, let him repent. Maranatha. Amen&quot;. The prayer is reminiscent of Revelation 22:17–20 and 1 Corinthians 16:22.

John Dominic Crossan endorses John W. Riggs&#x27; proposal in a 1984 &quot;The Second Century&quot; article that &quot;there are two quite separate eucharistic celebrations given in Didache 9–10, with the earlier one now put in second place&quot;. The section beginning at 10.1 is a reworking of the Jewish birkat ha-mazon, a three-strophe prayer at the conclusion of a meal, which includes a blessing of God for sustaining the universe, a blessing of God who gives the gifts of food, earth, and covenant, and a prayer for the restoration of Jerusalem; the content is &quot;Christianized&quot;, but the form remains Jewish. It is similar to the Syrian Church eucharist rite of the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari, belonging to &quot;a primordial era when the euchology of the Church had not yet inserted the Institution Narrative in the text of the Eucharistic Prayer&quot;.

===Church organization===
The church organization reflected in the &quot;Didache&quot; seems to be underdeveloped. Itinerant apostles and prophets are of great importance, serving as &quot;chief priests&quot; and possibly celebrating the Eucharist. Development through the ages indicates that titles changed without understanding of the workings of the various roles by later editors in the belief that the roles were interchangeable – indicating that prophetic knowledge was not operating actively during a season of &quot;closed vision&quot; (as in the time of Samuel), modernised titles not indicating prophetic knowledge. The text offers guidelines on how to differentiate a genuine prophet that deserves support from a false prophet who seeks to exploit the community&#x27;s generosity. For example, a prophet who fails to act as he preaches is a false prophet (11:10). The local leadership consists of bishops and deacons, and they seem to be taking the place of the itinerant ministry. Christians are enjoined to gather on Sunday to break bread, but to confess their sins first as well as reconcile themselves with others if they have grievances (Chapter 14).

==Matthew and the &quot;Didache&quot;==

Significant similarities between the &quot;Didache&quot; and the Gospel of Matthew have been found as these writings share words, phrases, and motifs. There is also an increasing reluctance of modern scholars to support the thesis that the &quot;Didache&quot; used Matthew. This close relationship between these two writings might suggest that both documents were created in the same historical and geographical setting. One argument that suggests a common environment is that the community of both the &quot;Didache&quot; and the gospel of Matthew was probably composed of Jewish Christians from the beginning. The Two Ways teaching (&quot;Didache&quot; 1–6) may also have served as a pre-baptismal instruction within the community of the &quot;Didache&quot; and Matthew. Furthermore, the correspondence of the Trinitarian baptismal formula in the &quot;Didache&quot; and Matthew (&quot;Didache&quot; 7 and Matthew 28:19) as well as the similar shape of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (&quot;Didache&quot; 8 and Matthew 6:5–13) appear to reflect the use of similar oral traditions. Finally, both the community of the &quot;Didache&quot; (&quot;Didache&quot; 11–13) and Matthew (Matthew 7:15–23; 10:5–15, 40–42; 24:11,24) were visited by itinerant apostles and prophets, some of whom were heterodox.

<text>Manga Entertainment was a producer, licensee, and distributor of anime in the United States and the United Kingdom. Originally founded in the UK in 1987, the UK branch became Funimation UK and Ireland in 2021, also currently known as Crunchyroll Ltd. since 2022, while its U.S. branch was absorbed into Starz Inc. (now owned by Lionsgate).
Despite its name, the company&#x27;s principal business was the distribution of anime rather than manga, although they have published some manga (such as &quot;Crying Freeman&quot;) under the Manga Books imprint.

== History ==
Manga Entertainment (formerly Island World Communications) was founded in London in 1991 by Laurence Guinness, Chris Blackwell and Andrew Frain as a subsidiary of Island Records&#x27; Island World Group. IWC took over the company number for Golden Square Music, but had no relationship to IWC or Manga. Manga Entertainment expanded into North America in 1993 with the purchase of L.A. Hero, forming Manga U.S. while Manga UK entered the Australian market in late 1993 and began releasing titles in January 1994 in conjunction with the Australian division of Island&#x27;s parent company, PolyGram (through PolyGram Video) and local independent distributor Siren Entertainment.

On May 13, 2004, IDT Entertainment, a division of IDT Corporation announced they would purchase Manga U.S., becoming a subsidiary of IDT Entertainment. In 2005, Manga UK and Manga U.S. began to operate independently from each other, but still remain under the same ownership. Liberty Media would then purchase IDT Entertainment in 2006 and would be renamed as Starz Media.

In 2011, Manga U.S. ceased licensing new products after the release of &quot;Redline&quot; and was absorbed into Starz Media. On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin-off Starz Media into a separate publicly traded company. The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013 which included all subsidiaries.

=== 2015–present ===
On February 26, 2015, the UK branch was acquired from Starz Media, alongside its parent Anchor Bay UK, by managing director Colin Lomax. Anchor Bay UK was renamed to Platform Entertainment and went on to have exclusive rights to the Manga Entertainment branding and catalog in the UK and Ireland.

In June 2016, Lionsgate announced they would acquire Starz Inc. which would eventually be completed in December 2016, placing Manga U.S. under Lionsgate Home Entertainment. In the same month, Kaleidoscope Film Distribution announced they had purchased Platform Entertainment and confirmed that they would split Manga UK off to become separately operated. After Platform Entertainment stopped distributing Manga titles, they went on to having their titles released in the UK by Spirit Entertainment.

In 2017, Lionsgate Home Entertainment relaunched Manga U.S.&#x27; website and its Facebook and Twitter pages, and confirmed a relaunch in the near future. Lionsgate currently licenses the Manga Entertainment brand-name from Crunchyroll. In the following year, the CEO Colin Lomax had died, between Christmas 2017 and New Years Day 2018. As of September 2023, the relaunch did not happen as of yet, with some of Manga&#x27;s titles like &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; being rereleased under the main Lionsgate banner.

<text>In contemporary education, mathematics education—known in Europe as the didactics or pedagogy of mathematics—is the practice of teaching, learning, and carrying out scholarly research into the transfer of mathematical knowledge.

Although research into mathematics education is primarily concerned with the tools, methods, and approaches that facilitate practice or the study of practice, it also covers an extensive field of study encompassing a variety of different concepts, theories and methods. National and international organisations regularly hold conferences and publish literature in order to improve mathematics education.

==History==

=== Ancient ===
Elementary mathematics were a core part of education in many ancient civilisations, including ancient Egypt, ancient Babylonia, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and Vedic India. In most cases, formal education was only available to male children with sufficiently high status, wealth, or caste. The oldest known mathematics textbook is the Rhind papyrus, dated from circa 1650 BCE.

==== Pythagorean theorem ====
Historians of Mesopotamia have confirmed that use of the Pythagorean rule dates back to the Old Babylonian Empire (20th–16th centuries BC) and that it was being taught in scribal schools over one thousand years before the birth of Pythagoras.

In Plato&#x27;s division of the liberal arts into the trivium and the quadrivium, the quadrivium included the mathematical fields of arithmetic and geometry. This structure was continued in the structure of classical education that was developed in medieval Europe. The teaching of geometry was almost universally based on Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. Apprentices to trades such as masons, merchants, and moneylenders could expect to learn such practical mathematics as was relevant to their profession.

=== Medieval and early modern ===
In the Middle Ages, the academic status of mathematics declined, because it was strongly associated with trade and commerce, and considered somewhat un-Christian. Although it continued to be taught in European universities, it was seen as subservient to the study of natural, metaphysical, and moral philosophy. The first modern arithmetic curriculum (starting with addition, then subtraction, multiplication, and division) arose at reckoning schools in Italy in the 1300s. Spreading along trade routes, these methods were designed to be used in commerce. They contrasted with Platonic math taught at universities, which was more philosophical and concerned numbers as concepts rather than calculating methods. They also contrasted with mathematical methods learned by artisan apprentices, which were specific to the tasks and tools at hand. For example, the division of a board into thirds can be accomplished with a piece of string, instead of measuring the length and using the arithmetic operation of division.

The first mathematics textbooks to be written in English and French were published by Robert Recorde, beginning with &quot;The Grounde of Artes&quot; in 1543. However, there are many different writings on mathematics and mathematics methodology that date back to 1800 BCE. These were mostly located in Mesopotamia, where the Sumerians were practicing multiplication and division. There are also artifacts demonstrating their methodology for solving equations like the quadratic equation. After the Sumerians, some of the most famous ancient works on mathematics came from Egypt in the form of the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus. The more famous Rhind Papyrus has been dated back to approximately 1650 BCE, but it is thought to be a copy of an even older scroll. This papyrus was essentially an early textbook for Egyptian students.

The social status of mathematical study was improving by the seventeenth century, with the University of Aberdeen creating a Mathematics Chair in 1613, followed by the Chair in Geometry being set up in University of Oxford in 1619 and the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics being established by the University of Cambridge in 1662.

=== Modern ===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Industrial Revolution led to an enormous increase in urban populations. Basic numeracy skills, such as the ability to tell the time, count money, and carry out simple arithmetic, became essential in this new urban lifestyle. Within the new public education systems, mathematics became a central part of the curriculum from an early age.

By the twentieth century, mathematics was part of the core curriculum in all developed countries.

During the twentieth century, mathematics education was established as an independent field of research. Main events in this development include the following:

* In 1893, a Chair in mathematics education was created at the University of Göttingen, under the administration of Felix Klein.
* The International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) was founded in 1908, and Felix Klein became the first president of the organisation.
* The professional periodical literature on mathematics education in the United States had generated more than 4,000 articles after 1920, so in 1941 William L. Schaaf published a classified index, sorting them into their various subjects.
* A renewed interest in mathematics education emerged in the 1960s, and the International Commission was revitalized.
* In 1968, the Shell Centre for Mathematical Education was established in Nottingham.
* The first International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME) was held in Lyon in 1969. The second congress was in Exeter in 1972, and after that, it has been held every four years.

Midway through the twentieth century, the cultural impact of the &quot;electronic age&quot; (McLuhan) was also taken up by educational theory and the teaching of mathematics. While previous approach focused on &quot;working with specialized &#x27;problems&#x27; in arithmetic&quot;, the emerging structural approach to knowledge had &quot;small children meditating about number theory and &#x27;sets&#x27;.&quot; Since the 1980s, there have been a number of efforts to reform the traditional curriculum, which focuses on continuous mathematics and relegates even some basic discrete concepts to advanced study, to better balance coverage of the continuous and discrete sides of the subject:
* In the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a push to make discrete mathematics more available at the post-secondary level;
* From the late 1980s into the new millennium, countries like the US began to identify and standardize sets of discrete mathematics topics for primary and secondary education;
* Concurrently, academics began compiling practical advice on introducing discrete math topics into the classroom;
* Researchers continued arguing the urgency of making the transition throughout the 2000s; and
* In parallel, some textbook authors began working on materials explicitly designed to provide more balance.
Similar efforts are also underway to shift more focus to mathematical modeling as well as its relationship to discrete math.

==Objectives==

At different times and in different cultures and countries, mathematics education has attempted to achieve a variety of different objectives. These objectives have included:

* The teaching and learning of basic numeracy skills to all students
* The teaching of practical mathematics (arithmetic, elementary algebra, plane and solid geometry, trigonometry, probability, statistics) to most students, to equip them to follow a trade or craft and to understand mathematics commonly used in news and Internet (such as percentages, charts, probability, and statistics)
* The teaching of abstract mathematical concepts (such as set and function) at an early age
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as Euclidean geometry) as an example of an axiomatic system and a model of deductive reasoning
* The teaching of selected areas of mathematics (such as calculus) as an example of the intellectual achievements of the modern world
* The teaching of advanced mathematics to those students who wish to follow a career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields
* The teaching of heuristics and other problem-solving strategies to solve non-routine problems
*The teaching of mathematics in social sciences and actuarial sciences, as well as in some selected arts under liberal arts education in liberal arts colleges or universities

==Methods==

The method or methods used in any particular context are largely determined by the objectives that the relevant educational system is trying to achieve. Methods of teaching mathematics include the following:
* Computer-based math: an approach based on the use of mathematical software as the primary tool of computation.
* Computer-based mathematics education: involves the use of computers to teach mathematics. Mobile applications have also been developed to help students learn mathematics.
* Classical education: the teaching of mathematics within the quadrivium, part of the classical education curriculum of the Middle Ages, which was typically based on Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; taught as a paradigm of deductive reasoning.
* Conventional approach: the gradual and systematic guiding through the hierarchy of mathematical notions, ideas and techniques. Starts with arithmetic and is followed by Euclidean geometry and elementary algebra taught concurrently. Requires the instructor to be well informed about elementary mathematics since didactic and curriculum decisions are often dictated by the logic of the subject rather than pedagogical considerations. Other methods emerge by emphasizing some aspects of this approach.
*Relational approach: uses class topics to solve everyday problems and relates the topic to current events. This approach focuses on the many uses of mathematics and helps students understand why they need to know it as well as helps them to apply mathematics to real-world situations outside of the classroom.
*Historical method: teaching the development of mathematics within a historical, social, and cultural context. Proponents argue it provides more human interest than the conventional approach.
*Discovery math: a constructivist method of teaching (discovery learning) mathematics which centres around problem-based or inquiry-based learning, with the use of open-ended questions and manipulative tools. This type of mathematics education was implemented in various parts of Canada beginning in 2005. Discovery-based mathematics is at the forefront of the Canadian &quot;math wars&quot; debate with many criticizing it for declining math scores.
*New Math: a method of teaching mathematics which focuses on abstract concepts such as set theory, functions, and bases other than ten. Adopted in the US as a response to the challenge of early Soviet technical superiority in space, it began to be challenged in the late 1960s. One of the most influential critiques of the New Math was Morris Kline&#x27;s 1973 book &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Add&quot;. The New Math method was the topic of one of Tom Lehrer&#x27;s most popular parody songs, with his introductory remarks to the song: &quot;...in the new approach, as you know, the important thing is to understand what you&#x27;re doing, rather than to get the right answer.&quot;
* Recreational mathematics: mathematical problems that are fun can motivate students to learn mathematics and can increase their enjoyment of mathematics.
* Standards-based mathematics: a vision for pre-college mathematics education in the United States and Canada, focused on deepening student understanding of mathematical ideas and procedures, and formalized by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics which created the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.
* Mastery: an approach in which most students are expected to achieve a high level of competence before progressing.
* Problem solving: the cultivation of mathematical ingenuity, creativity, and heuristic thinking by setting students open-ended, unusual, and sometimes unsolved problems. The problems can range from simple word problems to problems from international mathematics competitions such as the International Mathematical Olympiad. Problem-solving is used as a means to build new mathematical knowledge, typically by building on students&#x27; prior understandings.
* Exercises: the reinforcement of mathematical skills by completing large numbers of exercises of a similar type, such as adding simple fractions or solving quadratic equations.
* Rote learning: the teaching of mathematical results, definitions and concepts by repetition and memorisation typically without meaning or supported by mathematical reasoning. A derisory term is &quot;drill and kill&quot;. In traditional education, rote learning is used to teach multiplication tables, definitions, formulas, and other aspects of mathematics.
* Math walk: a walk where experience of perceived objects and scenes is translated into mathematical language.

==Content and age levels==

Different levels of mathematics are taught at different ages and in somewhat different sequences in different countries. Sometimes a class may be taught at an earlier age than typical as a special or honors class.

Elementary mathematics in most countries is taught similarly, though there are differences. Most countries tend to cover fewer topics in greater depth than in the United States. During the primary school years, children learn about whole numbers and arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Comparisons and measurement are taught, in both numeric and pictorial form, as well as fractions and proportionality, patterns, and various topics related to geometry.

At high school level in most of the US, algebra, geometry, and analysis (pre-calculus and calculus) are taught as separate courses in different years. 
On the other hand, in most other countries (and in a few US states), mathematics is taught as an integrated subject, with topics from all branches of mathematics studied every year; 
students thus undertake a pre-defined course - entailing several topics - rather than choosing courses &quot;à la carte&quot; as in the United States. 
Even in these cases, however, several &quot;mathematics&quot; options may be offered, selected based on the student&#x27;s intended studies post high school.
(In South Africa, for example, the options are Mathematics, Mathematical Literacy and Technical Mathematics.)
Thus, a science-oriented curriculum typically overlaps the first year of university mathematics, and includes differential calculus and trigonometry at age 16–17 and integral calculus, complex numbers, analytic geometry, exponential and logarithmic functions, and infinite series in their final year of secondary school; Probability and statistics are similarly often taught.

At college and university level, science and engineering students will be required to take multivariable calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra; at several US colleges, the minor or AS in mathematics substantively comprises these courses. Mathematics majors study additional other areas within pure mathematics—and often in applied mathematics—with the requirement of specified advanced courses in analysis and modern algebra. Other topics in pure mathematics include differential geometry, set theory, and topology. Applied mathematics may be taken as a major subject in its own right, such as partial differential equations, optimization, and numerical analysis. Specific topics are taught within other courses: for example, civil engineers may be required to study fluid mechanics, and &quot;math for computer science&quot; might include graph theory, permutation, probability, and formal mathematical proofs. Pure and applied math degrees often include modules in probability theory or mathematical statistics, as well as stochastic processes. (Theoretical) physics is mathematics-intensive, often overlapping substantively with the pure or applied math degree. Business mathematics is usually limited to introductory calculus and (sometimes) matrix calculations; economics programs additionally cover optimization, often differential equations and linear algebra, and sometimes analysis. Business and social science students also typically take statistics and probability courses.

==Standards==
Throughout most of history, standards for mathematics education were set locally, by individual schools or teachers, depending on the levels of achievement that were relevant to, realistic for, and considered socially appropriate for their pupils.

In modern times, there has been a move towards regional or national standards, usually under the umbrella of a wider standard school curriculum. In England, for example, standards for mathematics education are set as part of the National Curriculum for England, while Scotland maintains its own educational system. Many other countries have centralized ministries which set national standards or curricula, and sometimes even textbooks.

Ma (2000) summarized the research of others who found, based on nationwide data, that students with higher scores on standardized mathematics tests had taken more mathematics courses in high school. This led some states to require three years of mathematics instead of two. But because this requirement was often met by taking another lower-level mathematics course, the additional courses had a “diluted” effect in raising achievement levels.

In North America, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) published the &quot;Principles and Standards for School Mathematics&quot; in 2000 for the United States and Canada, which boosted the trend towards reform mathematics. In 2006, the NCTM released &quot;Curriculum Focal Points&quot;, which recommend the most important mathematical topics for each grade level through grade 8. However, these standards were guidelines to implement as American states and Canadian provinces chose. In 2010, the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers published the Common Core State Standards for US states, which were subsequently adopted by most states. Adoption of the Common Core State Standards in mathematics is at the discretion of each state, and is not mandated by the federal government. &quot;States routinely review their academic standards and may choose to change or add onto the standards to best meet the needs of their students.&quot; The NCTM has state affiliates that have different education standards at the state level. For example, Missouri has the Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics (MCTM) which has its pillars and standards of education listed on its website. The MCTM also offers membership opportunities to teachers and future teachers so that they can stay up to date on the changes in math educational standards.

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), created by the Organisation for the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is a global program studying the reading, science, and mathematics abilities of 15-year-old students. The first assessment was conducted in the year 2000 with 43 countries participating. PISA has repeated this assessment every three years to provide comparable data, helping to guide global education to better prepare youth for future economies. There have been many ramifications following the results of triennial PISA assessments due to implicit and explicit responses of stakeholders, which have led to education reform and policy change.
==Research==
According to Hiebert and Grouws, &quot;Robust, useful theories of classroom teaching do not yet exist.&quot; However, there are useful theories on how children learn mathematics, and much research has been conducted in recent decades to explore how these theories can be applied to teaching. The following results are examples of some of the current findings in the field of mathematics education.

=== Important results ===
:One of the strongest results in recent research is that the most important feature of effective teaching is giving students &quot;the opportunity to learn&quot;. Teachers can set expectations, times, kinds of tasks, questions, acceptable answers, and types of discussions that will influence students&#x27; opportunities to learn. This must involve both skill efficiency and conceptual understanding.

=== Conceptual understanding ===
Source:

:Two of the most important features of teaching in the promotion of conceptual understanding times are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures, and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the US, where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.
:Deliberate, productive struggle with mathematical ideas refers to the fact that when students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, even if this struggle initially involves confusion and errors, the result is greater learning. This is true whether the struggle is due to intentionally challenging, well-implemented teaching, or unintentionally confusing, faulty teaching.

=== Formative assessment ===
:Formative assessment is both the best and cheapest way to boost student achievement, student engagement, and teacher professional satisfaction. Results surpass those of reducing class size or increasing teachers&#x27; content knowledge. Effective assessment is based on clarifying what students should know, creating appropriate activities to obtain the evidence needed, giving good feedback, encouraging students to take control of their learning and letting students be resources for one another.

=== Homework ===
:Homework assignments which lead students to practice past lessons or prepare for future lessons is more effective than those going over the current lesson. Students benefit from feedback. Students with learning disabilities or low motivation may profit from rewards. For younger children, homework helps simple skills, but not broader measures of achievement.

=== Students with difficulties ===
Source:
:Students with genuine difficulties (unrelated to motivation or past instruction) struggle with basic facts, answer impulsively, struggle with mental representations, have poor number sense, and have poor short-term memory. Techniques that have been found productive for helping such students include peer-assisted learning, explicit teaching with visual aids, instruction informed by formative assessment, and encouraging students to think aloud.
:In particular, research surrounding students with disabilities in a mathematics classroom is mostly done by special education researchers. Some mathematics education researchers have called for more collaboration across disciplines to better understand supports that could be helpful to mathematics students with disabilities.

=== Algebraic reasoning ===
:Elementary school children need to spend a long time learning to express algebraic properties without symbols before learning algebraic notation. When learning symbols, many students believe letters always represent unknowns and struggle with the concept of variable. They prefer arithmetic reasoning to algebraic equations for solving word problems. It takes time to move from arithmetic to algebraic generalizations to describe patterns. Students often have trouble with the minus sign and understand the equals sign to mean &quot;the answer is...&quot;.

=== Cultural Equity ===
:Despite the popular belief that mathematics is race neutral, some research suggests that effective mathematics teaching of culturally diverse students requires a culturally relevant pedagogy that considers students&#x27; cultural backgrounds and experiences. The three criteria for culturally relevant pedagogy are academic success, cultural competence, and critical consciousness. More recent research proposes that culturally sustaining pedagogy explicitly aims to perpetuate and foster cultural and linguistic pluralism within the educational system, ensuring that students can thrive while retaining their cultural identities.

=== Mathematics Teacher Education ===
:Student teaching is a crucial part of a teacher candidate&#x27;s path to becoming a teacher. Recommended reform in mathematics teacher education includes a focus on learning to anticipate, elicit, and use students’ mathematical thinking as the primary goal, as opposed to models with an over-emphasis on classroom management and survival.

===Methodology===
As with other educational research (and the social sciences in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies. Quantitative research includes studies that use inferential statistics to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods to test their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.

Qualitative research, such as case studies, action research, discourse analysis, and clinical interviews, depend on small but focused samples in an attempt to understand student learning and to look at how and why a given method gives the results it does. Such studies cannot conclusively establish that one method is better than another, as randomized trials can, but unless it is understood &quot;why&quot; treatment X is better than treatment Y, application of results of quantitative studies will often lead to &quot;lethal mutations&quot; of the finding in actual classrooms. Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies, therefore, are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences. Many studies are “mixed”, simultaneously combining aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research, as appropriate.

====Randomized trials====
There has been some controversy over the relative strengths of different types of research. Because of an opinion that randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policymakers often consider only those studies. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes. In other disciplines concerned with human subjects—like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation—controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments. Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods. On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective, or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real school settings.

In the United States, the National Mathematics Advisory Panel (NMAP) published a report in 2008 based on studies, some of which used randomized assignment of treatments to experimental units, such as classrooms or students. The NMAP report&#x27;s preference for randomized experiments received criticism from some scholars. In 2010, the What Works Clearinghouse (essentially the research arm for the Department of Education) responded to ongoing controversy by extending its research base to include non-experimental studies, including regression discontinuity designs and single-case studies.

<doc id="326474" wikidata="Q3469805" url="?curid=326474" title="Saline River (Ouachita River tributary)">
<text>The Saline River, also known as Saline Creek, is a tributary of the Ouachita River in the south central portion of the U.S. state of Arkansas. It is the longest river that flows entirely within the state of Arkansas.

The Saline River begins in the eastern foothills of the Ouachita Mountains in Saline and Garland counties. The river has four headwater tributaries, the South Fork, the Middle Fork, the Alum Fork, and the North Fork, which merge northwest of the city of Benton.

The upper section of the Saline is a clear, cold-water stream with a series of fast-running shoals interspersed with quiet pools. The central section of the river has clear to murky water with long slower-moving pools interrupted by short stretches of fast water. The lower section is sluggish with murky water. The L&#x27;Aigle Creek connects to the Saline River near where the Saline River connects to the Ouachita River. During parts of the year the lower stretches of the river can be somewhat clogged with brush or trees.

After the merger of the three forks, the river flattens and travels through Grant, Cleveland, Bradley, and Ashley counties.

The river reaches its confluence with the Ouachita River in the marshy area north of Lake Jack Lee within the Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge.

The Saline is relatively free of development. The river runs through dense forests which are home to bear, deer, mink, otters, beaver, muskrats, turkey, squirrel as well as alligators in southern sections of the river. The river provides excellent fishing, scenery, and wilderness floating.

Smallmouth, largemouth, rock bass, and spotted bass as well as warmouth, longear, green sunfish, bluegills, channel catfish, and crappie inhabit the river.

Picnicking and swimming facilities are available at Jenkins&#x27; Ferry Historical Monument south of Sheridan which commemorates the Battle of Jenkins&#x27; Ferry during the American Civil War.

==History==
===Steamboats===
In the days of the steamboats, the steamboats traveled upstream as far as Bridges Bluff in Cleveland County. Cotton, timber, and staves (to make wood barrels) were shipped downstream each winter and spring (while the river water was high) to New Orleans and Monroe, Louisiana. Fifty-four steamboats have been documented on the Saline River.

*Carrie Poole, steamboat
*Enos Taylor, steamboat
*Handy, steamboat
*The Morgan Nelson, steamboat

Steamboat traffic on the Saline river was considerably reduced with the arrival of the rail system in 1880. One of the last steamboats on the Saline River was the Gate City, which sank on October 14, 1913, near Warren.

===Flood of 1927===
The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 flooded the areas along the Saline and Ouachita Rivers.

<doc id="326479" wikidata="Q1277383" url="?curid=326479" title="Serapion of Antioch">
<text>Serapion of Antioch was a Patriarch of Antioch (Greek: Σεραπίων; 191–211). He is known primarily through his theological writings, although all but a few fragments of his works have perished. His feast day is celebrated on 30 October.

Serapion was considered one of the chief theologians of his era. Eusebius refers to three works of Serapion in his history, but admits that others probably existed: first is a private letter addressed to Caricus and Pontius against Montanism, from which Eusebius quotes an extract (&quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; V, 19), as well as ascriptions showing that it was circulated amongst bishops in Asia and Thrace; next is a work addressed to a certain Domninus, who in time of persecution abandoned Christianity for the error of &quot;Jewish will-worship&quot; (&quot;Hist. Eccles&quot;, VI, 12).

Lastly, Eusebius quotes (vi.12.2) from a pamphlet Serapion wrote concerning the Docetic &quot;Gospel of Peter&quot;, in which Serapion presents an argument to the Christian community of Rhossus in Syria against this gospel and condemns it. He recalls the permission to read this apocryphal work given in ignorance of its true character and expresses his intention of visiting the church to strengthen them in the true faith. 

Eusebius also alludes to a number of personal letters Serapion wrote to Pontius, Caricus, and others about this &quot;Gospel of Peter&quot;.

Serapion also acted (Pantaenus supported him) against the influence of Gnosticism in Osroene by consecrating Mari of Edessa as bishop of Edessa, where Mari addressed the increasingly Gnostic tendencies that the churchman Bardesanes was introducing to its Christian community. He ordained Pantaenus as a priest or bishop in Edessa.

Serapion was succeeded as bishop of Antioch by Asclepiades (Eusebius &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; VI, 11, 4).

<doc id="326481" wikidata="Q77776" url="?curid=326481" title="Irritation">
<text>Irritation, in biology and physiology, is a state of inflammation or painful reaction to allergy or cell-lining damage. A stimulus or agent which induces the state of irritation is an irritant. Irritants are typically thought of as chemical agents (for example phenol and capsaicin) but mechanical, thermal (heat), and radiative stimuli (for example ultraviolet light or ionising radiations) can also be irritants. Irritation also has non-clinical usages referring to bothersome physical or psychological pain or discomfort.

Irritation can also be induced by some allergic response due to exposure of some allergens for example contact dermatitis, irritation of mucosal membranes and pruritus. Mucosal membrane is the most common site of irritation because it contains secretory glands that release mucus which attracts the allergens due to its sticky nature.

Chronic irritation is a medical term signifying that afflictive health conditions have been present for a while. There are many disorders that can cause chronic irritation, the majority involve the skin, vagina, eyes and lungs.

==Irritation in organisms==
In higher organisms, an allergic response may be the cause of irritation. An allergen is defined distinctly from an irritant, however, as allergy requires a specific interaction with the immune system and is thus dependent on the (possibly unique) sensitivity of the organism involved while an irritant, classically, acts in a non-specific manner.

It is a form of stress, but conversely, if one is stressed by unrelated matters, mild imperfections can cause more irritation than usual: one is irritable; see also sensitivity (human).

In more basic organisms, the status of pain is the perception of the being stimulated, which is not observable although it may be shared (see Gate control theory).
It is not proven that oysters can feel pain, but it is known that they react to irritants. When an irritating object becomes trapped within an oyster&#x27;s shell, it deposits layers of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), slowly increasing in size and producing a pearl. This is purely a defense mechanism, to trap a potentially threatening irritant such as a parasite inside its shell, or an attack from outside, injuring the mantle tissue. The oyster creates a pearl sac to seal off the irritation.

It has also been observed that an amoeba avoids being prodded with a pin, but there is not enough evidence to suggest how much it feels this. Irritation is apparently the only universal sense shared by even single-celled creatures.

It is postulated that most such beings also feel pain, but this is a projection – empathy. Some philosophers, notably René Descartes, denied it entirely, even for such higher mammals as dogs or primates like monkeys; Descartes considered intelligence a pre-requisite for the feeling of pain.

== Types ==

===Eye irritation===

Modern office work with use of office equipment has raised concerns about possible adverse health effects. Since the 1970s, reports have linked mucosal, skin, and general symptoms to work with self-copying paper. Emission of various particulate and volatile substances has been suggested as specific causes. These symptoms have been related to Sick Building Syndrome, which involves symptoms such as irritation to the eyes, skin, and upper airways, headache and fatigue.

The eye is also a source of chronic irritation. Disorders like Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, where one does not make tears, can cause a dry eye sensation which feels very unpleasant. The condition is difficult to treat and is lifelong. Besides artificial tears, there is a drug called Restasis which may help.

Blepharitis is dryness and itching on the upper eyelids. This condition is often seen in young people and can lead to reddish dry eye and scaly eyebrows. To relieve the itching sensation, one may need to apply warm compresses and use topical corticosteroid creams.

=== Skin ===

Eczema is another cause of chronic irritation and affects millions of individuals. Eczema simply means a dry skin which is itchy. The condition usually starts at an early age and continues throughout life. The major complaint of people with eczema is an itchy dry skin. Sometimes, the itching will be associated with a skin rash. The affected areas are always dry, scaly, reddish and may ooze sometimes. Eczema cannot be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. One should use moisturizers, use cold compresses and avoid frequent hot showers. There are over the counter corticosteroids creams which can be applied. Sometimes, an anti histamine has to be used to prevent the chronic itching sensations. There are also many individuals who have allergies to a whole host of substances like nuts, hair, dander, plants and fabrics. For these individuals, even the minimal exposure can lead to a full blown skin rash, itching, wheezing and coughing. Unfortunately, other than avoidance, there is no other cure. There are allergy shots which can help desensitize against an allergen but often the results are poor and the treatments are expensive. Most of these individuals with chronic irritation from allergens usually need to take anti histamines or use a bronchodilator to relieve symptoms.

Another common irritation disorder in females is intertrigo. This disorder is associated with chronic irritation under folds of skin. This is typically seen under large breasts, groins and folds of the abdomen in obese individuals. Candida quickly grows in warm moist areas of these folds and presents as a chronic itch. Over time, the skin becomes red and often oozes.
Perspiration is also a chronic type of irritation which can be very annoying. Besides being socially unacceptable, sweat stain the clothes and can present with a foul odor. In some individuals, the warm moist areas often become easily infected. The best way to treat excess sweating is good hygiene, frequent change of clothes and use of deodorants/antiperspirants.

=== Vaginal irritation ===

One of the most common areas of the body associated with irritation is the vagina. Many women complain of an itch, dryness, or discharge in the perineum at some point in their lives. There are several causes of vaginal irritation including fungal vaginitis (like candida) or trichomoniasis. Often, herpes simplex infection of the mouth or genitalia can be recurrent and prove to be extremely irritating.
Sometimes, the irritation can be of the chronic type and it can be so intense that it also causes painful intercourse. Aside from infections, chronic irritation of the vagina may be related to the use of contraceptives and condoms made from latex. The majority of contraceptives are made of synthetic chemicals which can induce allergies, rash and itching. Sometimes the lubricant used for intercourse may cause irritation.
Another cause of irritation in women is post menopausal vaginitis. The decline in the female sex hormones leads to development of dryness and itching in the vagina. This is often accompanied by painful sexual intercourse. Cracks and tears often develop on outer aspects of the labia which becomes red from chronic scratching. Post menopausal vaginitis can be treated with short term use of vaginal estrogen pessary and use of a moisturizer.

=== Lungs ===

Individuals who smoke or are exposed to smog or other airborne pollutants can develop a condition known as COPD. In this disorder, there is constant irritation of the breathing tubes (trachea) and the small airways. The constant irritation results in excess production of mucus which makes breathing difficult. Frequently, these individuals wake up in the morning with copious amounts of foul smelling mucus and a cough which lasts all day. Wheeze and heavy phlegm are common findings. COPD is a lifelong disorder and there is no cure. Eventually most people develop recurrent pneumonia, lack any type of endurance, and are unable to work productively. One of the ways to avoid chronic bronchitis is to stop or not smoke.

=== Stomach ===

Gastritis or stomach upset is a common irritating disorder affecting millions of people. Gastritis is basically inflammation of the stomach wall lining and has many causes. Smoking, excess alcohol consumption and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, account for the majority of causes of gastritis. In some cases, gastritis may develop after surgery, a major burn, infection or emotional stress. The most common symptoms of gastritis include sharp abdominal pain which may radiate to the back. This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and a lack of appetite. When the condition is severe it may even result in loss of blood on the stools. The condition often comes and goes for years because most people continue to drink alcohol or use NSAIDs. Treatment includes the use of antacids or acid neutralizing drugs, antibiotics, and avoiding spicy food and alcohol.

<doc id="326483" wikidata="Q279090" url="?curid=326483" title="Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity">
<text>In algebra, the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity expresses the product of two sums of two squares as a sum of two squares in two different ways. Hence the set of all sums of two squares is closed under multiplication. Specifically, the identity says
:formula_1
For example,
:formula_2

The identity is also known as the Diophantus identity, as it was first proved by Diophantus of Alexandria. It is a special case of Euler&#x27;s four-square identity, and also of Lagrange&#x27;s identity. 

Brahmagupta proved and used a more general Brahmagupta identity, stating
:formula_3
This shows that, for any fixed &quot;A&quot;, the set of all numbers of the form &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;Ay&quot;2 is closed under multiplication.

These identities hold for all integers, as well as all rational numbers; more generally, they are true in any commutative ring. All four forms of the identity can be verified by expanding each side of the equation. Also, (2) can be obtained from (1), or (1) from (2), by changing &quot;b&quot; to −&quot;b&quot;, and likewise with (3) and (4).

==History==
The identity first appeared in Diophantus&#x27; &quot;Arithmetica&quot; (III, 19), of the third century A.D.
It was rediscovered by Brahmagupta (598–668), an Indian mathematician and astronomer, who generalized it to Brahmagupta&#x27;s identity, and used it in his study of what is now called Pell&#x27;s equation. His &quot;Brahmasphutasiddhanta&quot; was translated from Sanskrit into Arabic by Mohammad al-Fazari, and was subsequently translated into Latin in 1126. The identity was introduced in western Europe in 1225 by Fibonacci, in &quot;The Book of Squares&quot;, and, therefore, the identity has been often attributed to him.

==Related identities==

Analogous identities are Euler&#x27;s four-square related to quaternions, and Degen&#x27;s eight-square derived from the octonions which has connections to Bott periodicity. There is also Pfister&#x27;s sixteen-square identity, though it is no longer bilinear.

These identities are strongly related with Hurwitz&#x27;s classification of composition algebras.

The Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity is a special form of Lagrange&#x27;s identity, which is itself a special form of Binet–Cauchy identity, in turn a special form of the Cauchy–Binet formula for matrix determinants.

== Multiplication of complex numbers ==

If &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; are real numbers, the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity is equivalent to the multiplicative property for absolute values of complex numbers:

:formula_4

This can be seen as follows: expanding the right side and squaring both sides, the multiplication property is equivalent to

:formula_5

and by the definition of absolute value this is in turn equivalent to

:formula_6

An equivalent calculation in the case that the variables &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; are rational numbers shows the identity may be interpreted as the statement that the norm in the field Q(&quot;i&quot;) is multiplicative: the norm is given by 
: formula_7
and the multiplicativity calculation is the same as the preceding one.

== Application to Pell&#x27;s equation ==
In its original context, Brahmagupta applied his discovery of this identity to the solution of Pell&#x27;s equation &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;Ay&quot;2 = 1. Using the identity in the more general form

:formula_8

he was able to &quot;compose&quot; triples (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;1, &quot;k&quot;1) and (&quot;x&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;2, &quot;k&quot;2) that were solutions of &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;Ay&quot;2 = &quot;k&quot;, to generate the new triple

:formula_9

Not only did this give a way to generate infinitely many solutions to &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;Ay&quot;2 = 1 starting with one solution, but also, by dividing such a composition by &quot;k&quot;1&quot;k&quot;2, integer or &quot;nearly integer&quot; solutions could often be obtained. The general method for solving the Pell equation given by Bhaskara II in 1150, namely the chakravala (cyclic) method, was also based on this identity.

== Writing integers as a sum of two squares ==
When used in conjunction with one of Fermat&#x27;s theorems, the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity proves that the product of a square and any number of primes of the form 4&quot;n&quot; + 1 is a sum of two squares.

<doc id="326484" wikidata="Q3307199" url="?curid=326484" title="Charlie Finley">
<text>Charles Oscar Finley (February 22, 1918 – February 19, 1996), nicknamed &quot;Charlie O&quot; or &quot;Charley O&quot;, was an American businessman who owned Major League Baseball&#x27;s Oakland Athletics. Finley purchased the franchise while it was located in Kansas City, moving it to Oakland in 1968. He is also known as a short-lived owner of the National Hockey League&#x27;s California Golden Seals and the American Basketball Association&#x27;s Memphis Tams.

==Early life==
Finley was born in Ensley, Birmingham, Alabama, attended Ensley High School but was further raised in Gary, Indiana, and later lived in La Porte, east of Chicago. Finley made his fortune in the insurance business, being among the first to write group medical insurance policies for those in the medical profession.

Finley showed a penchant for flair and inventive business practices. Sometimes, when wooing prospective customers, Finley would drive the client through the richest section of Gary. Pointing out a large mansion, Finley would declare &quot;That&#x27;s my place there, but I&#x27;m having it remodeled right now.&quot; Finley&#x27;s fortunes grew and he ended up owning a 40-story insurance building in downtown Chicago. In 1956, Charles Finley purchased a home built in 1942 on Johnson Road just north of Pine Lake in LaPorte, Indiana. He hired John Mihelic as his ranch caretaker. The property was a working cattle ranch which consisted of an 18th-century, eleven-room colonial manor house and nine barns with various outbuildings. Finley had a large mansion built on the property, keeping the colonial house as caretakers quarters. The new house, which featured rounded porticoes and columns, resembled the White House.

Finley had a large &quot;Home of the Oakland A&#x27;s&quot; sign installed on the roof of another large barn where it could be viewed by vehicles passing on the Indiana toll road. It was to this place that Finley often brought the whole team and held picnics and pool parties attended by friends, business associates, and locals, who mingled with members of the team and took numerous photographs.

In 1941, Finley married the former Shirley McCartney. They had eight children before the marriage ended in a bitter divorce, the proceedings of which lasted 6 years. The Finleys separated in 1974, and according to a biographer, Finley was unfaithful during his marriage and frequently estranged both his friends and family. Shirley Finley won a massive divorce settlement. Finley was estranged from most of his children at the time of his death. Finley died three days shy of his 78th birthday. His former wife, who remarried, died in 2010.

==Owner of the A&#x27;s==

===In Kansas City===
Finley entered the ranks of Major League Baseball owners after multiple failed attempts to acquire franchises during the 1950s.

He first attempted to buy the Philadelphia Athletics in 1954, but American League owners instead approved the sale of the team to Arnold Johnson, who moved the club to Kansas City for the 1955 season.

In 1956, Finley unsuccessfully bid for the Detroit Tigers, who instead were sold to a Michigan-based group led by broadcasting magnates John Fetzer and Fred Knorr. In 1959, when Dorothy Comiskey Rigney put her majority holdings in the Chicago White Sox up for sale, Finley lost out to a group headed by Bill Veeck. Then, one year later, he was among a group of contenders for the American League expansion franchise earmarked for Los Angeles, but actor, singer and broadcasting tycoon Gene Autry ended up as the founding principal owner of the Angels.

Fate, however, would play a role in Finley&#x27;s fifth, and ultimately successful, attempt to enter baseball — and it would come from his 1954 target, now the Kansas City Athletics. On March 3, 1960, owner Arnold Johnson died suddenly and unexpectedly from a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 54. The second-division Athletics struggled through a last-place season while being operated by Johnson&#x27;s estate. Just weeks after Finley lost his bid for the Angels&#x27; franchise, on December 19, 1960, he purchased the estate&#x27;s controlling interest in the Athletics; he then bought out the minority owners a year later. Finley quickly started to turn the franchise around, refusing to make deals with the New York Yankees (for which the Athletics had been criticized) and searching for unheralded talent. From 1961 onward, Finley was effectively his own general manager, though the A&#x27;s nominally had someone who had the title or duties of general manager until 1966.

Finley also repeatedly tried to move the team. In January 1964 he reached an agreement with Louisville, to move the team there for the 1964 season, signing a two-year lease on a stadium. When that proposed move was blocked by the American League he entertained offers from Denver and San Diego

====Charlie-O becomes the Athletics&#x27; mascot====
Finley replaced the Athletics&#x27; traditional elephant mascot with a live mule. &quot;Charlie-O&quot; was paraded about the outfield, into cocktail parties and hotel lobbies and into the press room after a large feeding to annoy reporters. (The mule died in 1976, at age 20.)

====The &quot;K.C. Pennant Porch&quot;====
After supposedly being told by manager Ed Lopat about the Yankees&#x27; success being attributable to the dimensions of Yankee Stadium, Finley built the &quot;K.C. Pennant Porch&quot; in right field in April 1964, which brought the right field fence in Municipal Stadium to match Yankee Stadium&#x27;s dimensions exactly, just from home plate. However, a rule passed in held that no (new or renovated) major-league fence could be closer than , so league officials forced Finley to move the fences back after two exhibition games.

The A&#x27;s owner then ordered a white line to be painted on the field at the original &quot;Pennant Porch&quot; distance, and told the public address announcer to announce &quot;That would have been a home run in Yankee Stadium&quot; whenever a fly ball was hit past that line but short of the fence. The practice was quickly abandoned after it turned out that the announcer was calling more &quot;would-be&quot; home runs for the opposition than the A&#x27;s.

====Uniform changes====
In 1963, Finley changed the team&#x27;s colors to Kelly Green, Fort Knox Gold, and Wedding Gown White. In 1967, he replaced the team&#x27;s traditional black spikes with white. Finley also started phasing out the team name &quot;Athletics&quot; in favor of &quot;A&#x27;s.&quot; (When Mickey Mantle saw the A&#x27;s&#x27; green-and-gold uniforms, he jeered, &quot;They should have come out of the dugout on tippy-toes, holding hands and singing,&quot; according to &quot;Baseball Digest&quot;.)

====The Beatles====
When the Beatles made their August/September 1964 concert tour of the United States, Finley was determined to bring them to Kansas City to perform at Municipal Stadium. Seeing one open date on the tour, Finley offered and paid the Beatles $150,000 ($ million+ today) for a concert on September 17, 1964, erasing a scheduled off day for the band in New Orleans. The tickets read: &quot;CHARLES O. FINLEY/ IS PLEASED TO PRESENT..FOR THE ENJOYMENT/ OF THE BEATLE FANS IN MID-AMERICA/ &#x27;THE BEATLES&#x27;/ IN PERSON” on the front, and showed a photograph of Finley wearing a Beatles wig on the back with the quote, &quot;Today&#x27;s Beatle&#x27;s (sic) Fans/ Are/ Tomorrow&#x27;s Baseball Fans.&quot; John Lennon was quoted later as saying he disliked Finley&#x27;s attempt to strong-arm the Beatles into playing longer than their then-standard half-hour concert set. The Beatles&#x27; $150,000 fee for the concert was considered a show business record for a one-night stand appearance.

Finley visited the group&#x27;s manager, Brian Epstein, in San Francisco on August 19, 1964, where the Beatles were playing the first date of the tour. He told Epstein that he was disappointed that Kansas City was not among the group&#x27;s itinerary, and offered first $50,000 and then $100,000 if the Beatles would schedule a concert in the Missouri city. Epstein refused, pointing out that on the only free date available, September 17, the band was scheduled for a day of rest in New Orleans. Finley encountered Epstein again in Los Angeles a week later and they agreed on $150,000.

===In Oakland===
====World Series success====
The A&#x27;s (as they were officially known from ) moved to California in January 1968, just as the new talent amassed over the years in the minors (such as Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando, Joe Rudi, Bert Campaneris, Catfish Hunter, Rollie Fingers, and Vida Blue) became ready for the Majors. Marvin Miller, the founder of MLB&#x27;s players union, called him &quot;absolutely the best judge of baseball talent I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

During the early 1970s, the once-moribund A&#x27;s became a &quot;Swingin&#x27; A&#x27;s&quot; powerhouse, winning three straight World Series from 1972 to 1974 and five straight division titles from 1971 to 1975, in the Oakland Coliseum. Though he no longer owned the team when the A&#x27;s won the World Series again in 1989, Tony La Russa, who managed that team, and outfielder Rickey Henderson were originally scouted by Finley.

====The beginning of free agency====
In 1974, after winning a third straight World Series championship, Finley lost ace pitcher Jim &#x27;Catfish&#x27; Hunter to free agency as a result of a contract clause violation. The A&#x27;s still managed to dominate throughout the 1975 regular season without Hunter, but were swept by Boston in the playoffs. With free agency looming at the end of the 1976 season, Finley began dismantling the ball club. Reggie Jackson and Ken Holtzman were traded to Baltimore a week prior to the start of the 1976 season. Finley attempted to sell Rudi and Fingers to the Red Sox for $1 million each and Blue to the Yankees for $1.5 million, at which Major League Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn decided to invoke the rarely used &quot;best interests of baseball&quot; clause in order to void Finley&#x27;s sales. Finley, in turn, hired famed sports attorney Neil Papiano and proceeded to file a $10 million restraint-of-trade lawsuit against Kuhn and Major League Baseball. Papiano and Finley lost the case (see &quot;Finley v. Kuhn&quot;). The court ruled that the commissioner had the authority to determine what is in the best interests of baseball. This lawsuit is widely recognized as one of the most famous, influential, and precedent-setting sports-related cases in the history of U.S. jurisprudence.

By the end of the 1976 season, most of the A&#x27;s stars had left the team as free agents. The few remaining stars from the A&#x27;s dynasty years were traded away, with the exceptions of Vida Blue and Billy North. There was much bad blood between the ace and his owner. Going back to 1971 when Vida Blue first joined the As, and had a legendary 24-8 rookie season, he earned $14,000. That winter, Blue sought a $92,500 salary, held out, missed much of the 1972 season, before Blue and Finley settled at $63,000. Later, in 1976, after an 18–13 season with a 2.35 ERA, Blue told reporters, &quot;I hope the next breath Charlie Finley takes is his last. I hope he falls flat on his face and dies of polio.&quot; Blue&#x27;s curse seemed to strike home, as in the 1977, only two years after winning a fifth straight division title and three years after winning a third consecutive World Series, the A&#x27;s finished in last place in their division, with one of the worst records in baseball. After the 1977 season, Finley tried to sell Blue again, this time to the Cincinnati Reds. Kuhn vetoed this trade as well, saying that it amounted to a fire sale. Kuhn also claimed that the addition of Blue to an already formidable Reds pitching staff would make a mockery of the National League West race.

====Selling the A&#x27;s====
Finley and his &quot;right-hand man,&quot; cousin Carl A. Finley started scouting for new talent in 1977. The Finleys brought in future stars such as Rickey Henderson, Tony Armas, Mitchell Page, Mike Norris, and Dwayne Murphy to rebuild the team. It was not until 1980 that the A&#x27;s showed signs of improvement, under manager and Berkeley native Billy Martin. However, after that season, Finley&#x27;s wife divorced him and would not accept an interest in the A&#x27;s as part of a settlement. With most of the Finleys&#x27; assets invested in either Charlie O&#x27;s insurance interests or the A&#x27;s, the Finleys were forced to sell.

In 1980, Finley agreed in principle to sell to businessman Marvin Davis, who planned to move the Athletics to Denver. However, just before Finley and Davis were due to sign a contract, the NFL&#x27;s Oakland Raiders announced they were moving to Los Angeles in 1982. Oakland and Alameda County officials, not wanting to be held responsible for losing Oakland&#x27;s status as a big-league city in its own right, refused to let the A&#x27;s out of their lease with the Coliseum. Forced to turn to local buyers, Finley agreed to sell the A&#x27;s to Walter A. Haas, Jr., president of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. in August 1980 for $12.7 million, with the deal finalized before the season. Carl Finley was asked to remain with the new owners as vice president/mentor. Under new management, the A&#x27;s made the playoffs in 1981.

====Marketing====
The Finley management was very effective at marketing. They changed the team uniforms to green and gold with white shoes and they gave some players colorful nicknames. The Finley organization introduced ball girls (one of whom, the future Debbi Fields, went on to found Mrs. Fields&#x27; Original Cookies, Inc.), and advocated night games for the World Series to increase the ability for fans to attend. Finley also was an outspoken advocate of the designated hitter rule, which he advocated until it was adopted by the American League. They were always full of new ideas, including:
*Orange baseballs – Tried in a few exhibition games, but hitters found it too hard to pick up the spin. The week of August 18, 1975, Charlie Finley was on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and his orange baseballs were featured in the article.
*A mechanical rabbit that would pop up behind home plate and deliver new balls to the umpire and was named &quot;Harvey,&quot; at the A&#x27;s home ballparks in Kansas City and Oakland.
*Hired Stanley Burrell (who would later gain worldwide fame as MC Hammer) as executive vice president when he was just a teenager to be his &quot;eyes and ears.&quot;
*Offering players $300 bonuses to grow moustaches during the 1972 baseball season. For star relief pitcher Rollie Fingers, the handlebar moustache he grew for Finley became a trademark.

Despite his reputation as a master promoter, Finley had less success marketing his team. According to baseball writer Rob Neyer, a Kansas City native, Finley thought he could sell a baseball team like he sold insurance. Soon after buying the A&#x27;s, he sent out 600,000 brochures to area residents and only netted $20,000 in sales. While in Oakland, the A&#x27;s rarely had radio and television contracts, and were practically invisible even in the Bay Area. For the first month of the 1978 season, the A&#x27;s radio flagship was KALX, the 10-watt college radio station of the University of California, Berkeley. A year later, the A&#x27;s didn&#x27;t sign a radio contract until the day before Opening Day. Largely as a result, the A&#x27;s never drew well even in their championship years, and were even sued by the city of Oakland and Alameda County in 1979.

The A&#x27;s have recently held promotional days with throwback uniforms from the Finley years, and have invited former players and play-by-play announcer Monte Moore to attend.

==Other sports ventures==
Finley purchased the Oakland Seals of the National Hockey League in 1970, renaming the team California Golden Seals. Mimicking the A&#x27;s, he changed the team colors to green and gold and had the Seals wear white skates instead of the traditional black skates, a move deeply unpopular with both players and fans.

In 1970, Finley also purchased the Memphis Pros of the American Basketball Association, changing the team&#x27;s name to the Memphis Tams, the name being an acronym for Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi. As was the case with the A&#x27;s, he changed the Tams&#x27; colors to green and gold. He hired recently retired Kentucky Wildcats basketball coach Adolph Rupp as team president. Finley ran it on a shoestring budget. After the first season, he sold the teams and returned to baseball.

In March 1987, Finley proposed a new football league. The league would merge with the Canadian Football League and be renamed the North American Football League. The American cities would be made up of those that lost out on the United States Football League folding, with Finley representing Chicago; the USFL&#x27;s Arizona Outlaws had already come out in support of the idea of playing in the CFL as an American team, as had certain executives with the Memphis Showboats. The CFL insisted upon a minimum $20 million per year television contract to even consider the idea, and though Finley was optimistic that such a contract could be secured, networks all rejected the plan, and the CFL Commissioner at the time, Douglas Mitchell, explicitly ruled out adding teams from the United States or changing the CFL&#x27;s format.

==Later life==
Finley lived his final years on his farm in LaPorte. He died at age 77 on February 19, 1996, three days before his 78th birthday. He had suffered from heart disease and had been admitted two weeks earlier to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago.

<doc id="326490" wikidata="Q731615" url="?curid=326490" title="Hyperbaric medicine">
<text>Hyperbaric medicine is medical treatment in which an increase in barometric pressure over ambient pressure is employed increasing the partial pressures of all gases present in the ambient atmosphere. The immediate effects include reducing the size of gas embolisms and raising the partial pressures of all gases present according to Henry&#x27;s law.
Currently, there are two types of hyperbaric medicine depending on the gases compressed, hyperbaric air and hyperbaric oxygen.

Hyperbaric air (HBA), consists of compressed atmospheric air (79% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and minor gases) and is FDA-approved for acute mountain sickness. The hyperbaric air environment is created by placing the patient in a portable hyperbaric air chamber and inflating that chamber up to 7.35 psi gauge (1.5 atmospheres absolute) using a foot-operated or electric air pump. Although the mechanisms of hyperbaric air are poorly understood it is thought that it relieves hypoxemia caused by the decreased partial pressure of oxygen resulting from high altitude by increasing the partial pressure of air (including oxygen and nitrogen) simulating a descent in altitude.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), is the medical use of greater than 99% oxygen at an ambient pressure higher than atmospheric pressure, and therapeutic recompression for decompression illness, is intended to reduce the injurious effects of systemic gas bubbles by physically reducing their size and providing improved conditions for elimination of bubbles and excess dissolved gas.

The equipment required for hyperbaric oxygen treatment consists of a pressure vessel for human occupancy, which may be of rigid or flexible construction, and a means of a controlled atmosphere supply. Operation is performed to a predetermined schedule by trained personnel who monitor the patient and may adjust the schedule as required. HBOT found early use in the treatment of decompression sickness, and has also shown great effectiveness in treating conditions such as gas gangrene and carbon monoxide poisoning. More recent research has examined the possibility that it may also have value for other conditions such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, but no significant evidence has been found.

A pressure vessel for human occupancy (PVHO) is an enclosure that is intended to be occupied by one or more persons at a pressure which differs from ambient by at least . All chambers used in the US made for hyperbaric medicine fall under the jurisdiction of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA requires hyperbaric chambers to comply with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers PVHO Codes and the National Fire Protection Association Standard 99, Health Care Facilities Code. Similar conditions apply in most other countries.

Hyperbaric medicine poses some inherent hazards that are mitigated by FDA-compliant equipment and trained personnel. Serious injury can occur at pressures as low as 2 psig (13.8 kPa) if a person in the PVHO is rapidly decompressed. If oxygen is used in the hyperbaric therapy, this can increase the fire hazard. This is why the FDA requires hyperbaric chambers to meet ASME PVHO and NFPA 99 standards or the local equivalent. All chambers that meet FDA standards must have an ASME data plate, and people seeking hyperbaric treatment should check to ensure the equipment and facilities are to proper standards.

Therapeutic recompression is usually also provided in a hyperbaric chamber. It is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness and may also be used to treat arterial gas embolism caused by pulmonary barotrauma of ascent. In emergencies divers may sometimes be treated by in-water recompression (when a chamber is not available) if suitable diving equipment (to reasonably secure the airway) is available.

A number of hyperbaric treatment schedules have been published over the years for both therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for other conditions. Some of these use breathing gases other than air or pure oxygen, when the partial pressure of oxygen must be limited but the pressure required is relatively high. Nitrox and Heliox treatment schedules are available for these cases. Treatment gas may be the ambient chamber gas, or delivered via a built-in breathing system.

==Scope==
Hyperbaric medicine includes hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which is the medical use of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure to increase the availability of oxygen in the body; and therapeutic recompression, which involves increasing the ambient pressure on a person, usually a diver, to treat decompression sickness or an air embolism by reducing the volume and more rapidly eliminating bubbles that have formed within the body.

==Medical uses==
In the United States the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, known as UHMS, lists approvals for reimbursement for certain diagnoses in hospitals and clinics. The following indications have approved (for reimbursement) uses of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as defined by the UHMS Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Committee:
* Air or gas embolism;
* Carbon monoxide poisoning;
** Carbon monoxide poisoning complicated by cyanide poisoning;
* Central retinal artery occlusion;
* Clostridal myositis and myonecrosis (gas gangrene);
* Crush injury, compartment syndrome, and other acute traumatic ischemias;
* Decompression sickness;
* Enhancement of healing in selected problem wounds;
** Diabetically derived illness, such as short-term relief of diabetic foot, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy;
* Exceptional blood loss (anemia);
* Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss;
* Intracranial abscess;
* Mucormycosis, especially rhinocerebral disease in the setting of diabetes mellitus;
* Necrotizing soft tissue infections (necrotizing fasciitis);
* Osteomyelitis (refractory);
* Delayed radiation injury (soft tissue and bony necrosis);
* Skin grafts and flaps (compromised);
* Thermal burns.

There is no reliable evidence to support its use in autism, cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, asthma, Bell&#x27;s palsy, cerebral palsy, depression, heart disease, migraines, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, spinal cord injury, sports injuries, or stroke. Furthermore, there is evidence that potential side effects of hyperbaric medicine pose an unjustified risk in such cases. A Cochrane review published in 2016 reviewed a small set of clinical trials attempting to treat autism spectrum disorders with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. They noted a small sample size and large &quot;confidence intervals&quot; did not provide much evidence. No links between improvements in social abilities or cognitive function were noted. There are also ethical issues with further trials, as the eardrum can be damaged during hyperbaric therapy. Despite the lack of evidence, in 2015, the number of people utilizing this therapy has continued to rise.

There is also insufficient evidence to support its use in acute traumatic or surgical wounds.

=== Hearing issues ===
There is limited evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves hearing in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss who present within two weeks of hearing loss. There is some indication that HBOT might improve tinnitus presenting in the same time frame.

=== Chronic ulcers ===
HBOT in diabetic foot ulcers increased the rate of early ulcer healing but does not appear to provide any benefit in wound healing at long-term follow-up. In particular, there was no difference in major amputation rate. For venous, arterial and pressure ulcers, no evidence was apparent that HBOT provides a long-term improvement over standard treatment.

=== Radiation injury ===
There is some evidence that HBOT is effective for late radiation tissue injury of bone and soft tissues of the head and neck. Some people with radiation injuries of the head, neck or bowel show an improvement in quality of life. Importantly, no such effect has been found in neurological tissues. The use of HBOT may be justified to selected patients and tissues, but further research is required to establish the best people to treat and timing of any HBO therapy.

=== Neuro-rehabilitation ===
As of 2012, there was no sufficient evidence to support using hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people who have traumatic brain injuries. In acute stroke, HBOT does not show benefit. Small clinical trials, however, have shown benefits from HBOT for stroke survivors between 6 months to 3 years after the acute phase.

HBOT in multiple sclerosis has not shown benefit and routine use is not recommended.

A 2007 review of HBOT in cerebral palsy found no difference compared to the control group. Neuropsychological tests also showed no difference between HBOT and room air and based on caregiver report, those who received room air had significantly better mobility and social functioning. Children receiving HBOT were reported to experience seizures and the need for tympanostomy tubes to equalize ear pressure, though the incidence was not clear.

=== Cancer ===
In alternative medicine, hyperbaric medicine has been promoted as a treatment for cancer. However, a 2011 study by the American Cancer Society reported no evidence it is effective for this purpose. A 2012 review article in the journal, &quot;Targeted Oncology,&quot; reports that &quot;there is no evidence indicating that HBO neither acts as a stimulator of tumor growth nor as an enhancer of recurrence. On the other hand, there is evidence that implies that HBO might have tumor-inhibitory effects in certain cancer subtypes, and we thus strongly believe that we need to expand our knowledge on the effect and the mechanisms behind tumor oxygenation.&quot;

===Migraines===
Low-quality evidence suggests that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may reduce the pain associated with an acute migraine headache in some cases. It is not known which people would benefit from this treatment, and there is no evidence that hyperbaric medicine can prevent future migraines. More research is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for treating migraines.

==Respiratory distress==
Patients who are having extreme difficulty breathing – acute respiratory distress syndrome – are commonly given oxygen and there have been limited trials of hyperbaric equipment in such cases. Examples include treatment of the Spanish flu and COVID-19.

== Contraindications ==
The toxicology of the treatment has been reviewed by Ustundag &quot;et al.&quot; and its risk management is discussed by Christian R. Mortensen, in light of the fact that most hyperbaric facilities are managed by departments of anaesthesiology and some of their patients are critically ill.

An absolute contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen therapy is untreated pneumothorax. The reason is concern that it can progress to tension pneumothorax, especially during the decompression phase of therapy, although treatment on oxygen-based tables may avoid that progression. The COPD patient with a large bleb represents a relative contraindication for similar reasons. Also, the treatment may raise the issue of occupational health and safety (OHS), for chamber inside attendants, who should not be compressed if they are unable to equalise ears and sinuses.

The following are relative contraindications&quot;meaning that special consideration must be made by specialist physicians before HBO treatments begin:&quot;
* Cardiovascular disease
* COPD with air trapping – can lead to pneumothorax during treatment.
* Upper respiratory infections – These conditions can make it difficult for the patient to equalise their ears or sinuses, which can result in what is termed ear or sinus squeeze.
* High fevers – In most cases the fever should be lowered before HBO treatment begins. Fevers may predispose to convulsions.
* Emphysema with CO2 retention – This condition can lead to pneumothorax during HBO treatment due to rupture of an emphysematous bulla during decompression. This risk can be evaluated by x-ray.
* History of thoracic (chest) surgery – This is rarely a problem and usually not considered a contraindication. However, there is concern that air may be trapped in lesions that were created by surgical scarring. These conditions need to be evaluated prior to considering HBO therapy.
* Malignant disease: Cancers thrive in blood-rich environments but may be suppressed by high oxygen levels. HBO treatment of individuals who have cancer presents a problem, since HBO both increases blood flow via angiogenesis and also raises oxygen levels. Taking an anti-angiogenic supplement may provide a solution. A study by Feldemier, et al. and NIH funded study on Stem Cells by Thom, et al., indicate that HBO is actually beneficial in producing stem/progenitor cells and the malignant process is not accelerated.
* Middle ear barotrauma is always a consideration in treating both children and adults in a hyperbaric environment because of the necessity to equalise pressure in the ears.

Pregnancy is not a relative contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen treatments, although it may be for underwater diving. In cases where a pregnant woman has carbon monoxide poisoning there is evidence that lower pressure (2.0 ATA) HBOT treatments are not harmful to the fetus, and that the risk involved is outweighed by the greater risk of the untreated effects of CO on the fetus (neurologic abnormalities or death.) In pregnant patients, HBO therapy has been shown to be safe for the fetus when given at appropriate levels and &quot;doses&quot; (durations). In fact, pregnancy lowers the threshold for HBO treatment of carbon monoxide-exposed patients. This is due to the high affinity of fetal hemoglobin for CO.

==Therapeutic principles==
The therapeutic consequences of HBOT and recompression result from multiple effects.

===Clinical pressure (2.0–3.0 Bar)===
The increased overall pressure is of therapeutic value in the treatment of decompression sickness and air embolism as it provides a physical means of reducing the volume of inert gas bubbles within the body; Exposure to this increased pressure is maintained for a period long enough to ensure that most of the bubble gas is dissolved back into the tissues, removed by perfusion and eliminated in the lungs.

The improved concentration gradient for inert gas elimination (oxygen window) by using a high partial pressure of oxygen increases the rate of inert gas elimination in the treatment of decompression sickness.

For many other conditions, the therapeutic principle of HBOT lies in its ability to drastically increase partial pressure of oxygen in the tissues of the body. The oxygen partial pressures achievable using HBOT are much higher than those achievable while breathing pure oxygen under conditions (i.e. at normal atmospheric pressure). This effect is achieved by an increase in the oxygen transport capacity of the blood. At normal atmospheric pressure, oxygen transport is limited by the oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin in red blood cells and very little oxygen is transported by blood plasma. Because the hemoglobin of the red blood cells is almost saturated with oxygen at atmospheric pressure, this route of transport cannot be exploited any further. Oxygen transport by plasma, however, is significantly increased using HBOT because of the higher solubility of oxygen as pressure increases.

=== Proangiogenic stem progenitor cell mobilization ===
A study suggests that exposure to hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT) might also mobilize stem/progenitor cells from the bone marrow by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism.

=== Low pressure hyperoxia, stem progenitor cell mobilization and inflammatory cytokine expression ===
A more recent study suggests that stem cell mobilization, similar to that seen in the Thom study, is also invoked at relative normo-baric pressure with a significantly smaller increase in oxygen concentration. This study also found a significant decrease in the expression of the systemic inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in venous blood. These results suggest that hyperbaria may not be required to invoke the transcriptional responses seen at higher partial pressures of oxygen and that the effect is due solely to oxygen.

== Hyperbaric chambers ==

===Construction===
The traditional type of hyperbaric chamber used for therapeutic recompression and HBOT is a rigid shelled pressure vessel. Such chambers can be run at absolute pressures typically about , or more in special cases. Navies, professional diving organizations, hospitals, and dedicated recompression facilities typically operate these. They range in size from semi-portable, one-patient units to room-sized units that can treat eight or more patients. The larger units may be rated for lower pressures if they are not primarily intended for treatment of diving injuries.

A rigid chamber may consist of:
* a pressure vessel designed to a code such as ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code 
* viewports to allow the medical personnel to visually monitor the occupants, and can be used for hand signalling as an auxiliary emergency communications method. The major components are the window (transparent acrylic), the window seat (holds the acrylic window), and retaining ring. Interior lighting can be provided by mounting lights outside the viewports. Viewports are a feature specific to PVHOs due to the need to see the people inside and evaluate their health. Other materials have been attempted, but they consistently fail to maintain their seal or have cracks which would progress rapidly to catastrphophic failure. Acrylic is more likely to have small cracks the operators can see and have time to take mitigation steps instead of failing catastrophically. Counterfeit chambers often do not use acrylic windows.
* one or more human entry hatchessmall and circular or wheel-in type hatches for patients on gurneys;
* the entry lock that allows human entrya separate chamber with two hatches, one to the outside and one to the main chamber, which can be independently pressurized to allow patients to enter or exit the main chamber while it is still pressurized;
* a low volume medical or service airlock for medicines, instruments, and food;
* transparent ports or closed-circuit television that allows technicians and medical staff outside the chamber to monitor the patient inside the chamber;
* an intercom system allowing two-way communication;
* an optional carbon dioxide scrubberconsisting of a fan that passes the gas inside the chamber through a soda lime canister;
* a control panel outside the chamber to open and close valves that control air flow to and from the chamber, and regulate oxygen to hoods or masks;
* an over-pressure relief valve;
* a built-in breathing system (BIBS) to supply and exhaust treatment gas;
* a fire suppression system.

Flexible monoplace chambers are available ranging from collapsible flexible aramid fiber-reinforced chambers which can be disassembled for transport via truck or SUV, with a maximum working pressure of 2 bar above ambient complete with BIBS allowing full oxygen treatment schedules. to portable, air inflated &quot;soft&quot; chambers that can operate at between above atmospheric pressure with no supplemental oxygen, and longitudinal zipper closure.

====Viewports and windows====

Acrylic windows with PVHO-1 defined standard geometries and design criteria are generally used. Shapes and sizes vary with chamber application and the requirements for the specific use.

The geometries in general use include:
* Flat circular windows (low pressure)
* Conical edged windows with flat inner and outer faces (high pressure on one side only)
* Circular windows with double beveled edges
* Light pipes

Low pressure, small diameter chambers may use large cylindrical windows fitted inside the metal structure. In some cases the whole cylindrical pressure chamber has been made from an acrylic tube.

The acrylic windows of a hyperbaric chamber have a limited lifespan, which can be expressed as the design life, which is the conservatively estimated life as calculated in the design process, typically about 10 years, and the service life, which is the actual time the window can be safely and legally used when well maintained, properly inspected, and repaired when necessary and possible and which can be as much as twice the design life.

There are three grades of inspection required:
*Operational inspection of the inner and outer surfaces is included in the checks before first pressurisation of the day by a competent chamber operator, and ensures that the surfaces have not been damaged since the last use.
*Maintenance inspection is done at specified intervals by a qualified maintenance inspector. This inspection is more thorough and may require removal of the window from the mounting to check for damage that is not visible when installed. This grade of inspection is generally also required for re-commissioning a chamber that has been out of service for longer than a specified period.
*Seat and seal inspection is done whenever a window has been removed for inspection or repair or a new window installed.
The window is examined to detect crazing, cracks, blisters, discolouration, scratches or pits.

====Operating pressures====

The operating pressure depends on the application. Chambers used for clinical hyperbaric oxygen therapy commonly have a maximum allowable working pressure of with a maximum of about Chambers used for support of commercial or military diving operations and for research may have a maximum allowable working pressure of up to .

=== Oxygen supply ===

In the larger multiplace chambers, patients inside the chamber breathe from either &quot;oxygen hoods&quot; – flexible, transparent soft plastic hoods with a seal around the neck similar to a space suit helmet – or tightly fitting oxygen masks, which supply pure oxygen and may be designed to directly exhaust the exhaled gas from the chamber. During treatment patients breathe 100% oxygen most of the time to maximise the effectiveness of their treatment, but have periodic &quot;air breaks&quot; during which they breathe chamber air (21% oxygen) to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity. The exhaled treatment gas must be removed from the chamber to prevent the buildup of oxygen, which could present a fire risk. Attendants may also breathe oxygen some of the time to reduce their risk of decompression sickness when they leave the chamber. The pressure inside the chamber is increased by opening valves allowing high-pressure air to enter from storage cylinders, which are filled by an air compressor. Chamber air oxygen content is kept between 19% and 23% to control fire risk (US Navy maximum 25%). If the chamber does not have a scrubber system to remove carbon dioxide from the chamber gas, the chamber must be isobarically ventilated to keep the CO2 within acceptable limits.

A soft chamber may be pressurized directly from a compressor. or from storage cylinders.

Smaller &quot;monoplace&quot; chambers can only accommodate the patient, and no medical staff can enter. The chamber may be pressurised with pure oxygen or compressed air. If pure oxygen is used, no oxygen breathing mask or helmet is needed, but the cost of using pure oxygen is much higher than that of using compressed air. If compressed air is used, then an oxygen mask or hood is needed as in a multiplace chamber. Most monoplace chambers can be fitted with a demand breathing system for air breaks. In low pressure soft chambers, treatment schedules may not require air breaks, because the risk of oxygen toxicity is low due to the lower oxygen partial pressures used (usually 1.3 ATA), and short duration of treatment.

For alert, cooperative patients, air breaks provided by mask are more effective than changing the chamber gas because they provide a quicker gas change and a more reliable gas composition both during the break and treatment periods.

== Treatments ==
Initially, HBOT was developed as a treatment for diving disorders involving bubbles of gas in the tissues, such as decompression sickness and gas embolism, It is still considered the definitive treatment for these conditions. The chamber treats decompression sickness and gas embolism by increasing pressure, reducing the size of the gas bubbles and improving the transport of blood to downstream tissues. After elimination of bubbles, the pressure is gradually reduced back to atmospheric levels. Hyperbaric chambers are also used for animals.

As of September 2023, a number of hyperbaric chambers in the US are turning divers with decompression sickness away, and only treating more profitable scheduled cases. The number of hyperbaric medical facilities in the US is estimated at about 1500, of which 67 are treating diving accidents, according to Divers Alert Network. Many facilities only provide hyperbaric treatment for wound care for economic reasons. Emergency hyperbaric services are more expensive to train and staff, and liability is increased.

=== Protocol ===
Emergency HBOT for decompression illness follows treatment schedules laid out in treatment tables. Most cases employ a recompression to absolute, the equivalent of of water, for 4.5 to 5.5 hours with the casualty breathing pure oxygen, but taking air breaks every 20 minutes to reduce oxygen toxicity. For extremely serious cases resulting from very deep dives, the treatment may require a chamber capable of a maximum pressure of , the equivalent of of water, and the ability to supply heliox as a breathing gas.

U.S. Navy treatment charts are used in Canada and the United States to determine the duration, pressure, and breathing gas of the therapy. The most frequently used tables are Table 5 and Table 6. In the UK the Royal Navy 62 and 67 tables are used.

The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) publishes a report that compiles the latest research findings and contains information regarding the recommended duration and pressure of the longer-term conditions.

=== Home and out-patient clinic treatment ===
There are several sizes of portable chambers, which are used for home treatment. These are usually referred to as &quot;mild personal hyperbaric chambers&quot;, which is a reference to the lower pressure (compared to hard chambers) of soft-sided chambers. The American Medical Association is opposed to home use or any other use of hyperbaric chambers if it is not &quot;in facilities with appropriately trained staff including physician supervision and prescription and only when the intervention has scientific support or rationale&quot; due demonstrated hazard 

In the US, these &quot;mild personal hyperbaric chambers&quot; are categorized by the FDA as CLASS II medical devices and requires a prescription in order to purchase one or take treatments. As with any hyperbaric chamber, the FDA require compliance with ASME and NFPA standards. The most common option (but not approved by FDA) some patients choose is to acquire an oxygen concentrator which typically delivers 85–96% oxygen as the breathing gas.

Oxygen is never fed directly into soft chambers but is rather introduced via a line and mask directly to the patient. FDA approved oxygen concentrators for human consumption in confined areas used for HBOT are regularly monitored for purity (±1%) and flow (10 to 15 liters per minute outflow pressure). An audible alarm will sound if the purity ever drops below 80%. Personal hyperbaric chambers use 120 volt or 220 volt outlets. The FDA warns against the use of oxygen concentrators or oxygen tanks with chambers that does not meet ASME and FDA standards, regardless of if the concentrators are FDA approved.

===Possible complications and concerns===
There are risks associated with HBOT, similar to some diving disorders. Pressure changes can cause a &quot;squeeze&quot; or barotrauma in the tissues surrounding trapped air inside the body, such as the lungs, behind the eardrum, inside paranasal sinuses, or trapped underneath dental fillings. Breathing high-pressure oxygen may cause oxygen toxicity. Temporarily blurred vision can be caused by swelling of the lens, which usually resolves in two to four weeks.

There are reports that cataracts may progress following HBOT, and rarely, may develop &quot;de novo&quot;, but this may be unrecognized and under reported. The cause is not fully explained, but evidence suggests that lifetime exposure of the lens to high partial pressure oxygen may be a major factor. Oxidative damage to lens proteins is thought to be responsible. This may be an end-stage of the relatively well documented myopic shift detected in most hyperbaric patients after a course of multiple treatments.

=== Effects of pressure ===
Patients inside the chamber may notice discomfort inside their ears as a pressure difference develops between their middle ear and the chamber atmosphere. This can be relieved by ear clearing using the Valsalva maneuver or other techniques. Continued increase of pressure without equalizing may cause ear drums to rupture, resulting in severe pain. As the pressure in the chamber increases further, the air may become warm.

To reduce the pressure, a valve is opened to allow air out of the chamber. As the pressure falls, the patient&#x27;s ears may &quot;squeak&quot; as the pressure inside the ear equalizes with the chamber. The temperature in the chamber will fall. The speed of pressurization and de-pressurization can be adjusted to each patient&#x27;s needs.

==Side effects==
Oxygen toxicity is a limitation on both maximum partial pressure of oxygen, and on length of each treatment.

HBOT can accelerate the development of cataracts over multiple repetitive treatments, and can cause temporary relative myopia over the shorter term.

== Regulation and legality ==
The use of hyperbaric chambers for medical and therapeutic procedures is generally regulated. Authorities have warned of potential risks to patients receiving treatment in unlicensed facilities, notably in Israel, Canada, and the United States. In Italy, the use of hyperbaric chambers for therapy was severely restricted to limited medical settings after a serious fire which killed ten patients in 1997.

In some jurisdictions, the use and availability of HBOT is further restricted at the subnational level. In the U.S. state of North Carolina, several cities including Durham, Raleigh and Charlotte have ordered operators of mild hyperbaric oxygen therapy to close to protect public safety due to a risk of fire.

Unlicensed and fraudulent operators have been subject to prosecution. In Australia, Oxymed Australia Pty Ltd and director Malcolm Hooper were ordered to pay AUS $3 million in fines after advertising hyperbaric therapy against the country&#x27;s Therapeutic Goods Act. In Canada, certain soft-shelled hyperbaric chambers were removed from the market for a potential risk to patients.

==Costs==
HBOT is recognized by Medicare in the United States as a reimbursable treatment for 14 UHMS &quot;approved&quot; conditions. A 1-hour HBOT session may cost between $300 and higher in private clinics, and over $2,000 in hospitals. U.S. physicians (M.D. or D.O.) may lawfully prescribe HBOT for &quot;off-label&quot; conditions such as stroke, and migraine. Such patients are treated in outpatient clinics. In the United Kingdom most chambers are financed by the National Health Service, although some, such as those run by Multiple Sclerosis Therapy Centres, are non-profit. In Australia, HBOT is not covered by Medicare as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. China and Russia treat more than 80 maladies, conditions, and trauma with HBOT.

==Personnel==
* Hyperbaric medical practitioner - a specialist in hyperbaric medicine
* Diving medical practitioner – a specialist in diving medicine
* Chamber operator – a person competent to operate a hyperbaric chamber
* Hyperbaric nurse – a nurse responsible for administering hyperbaric oxygen therapy to patients and supervising them throughout the treatment.
* Diving medical technician – member of a dive team who is trained in advanced first aid.
* Chamber attendant – a person trained in basic first aid who is medically fit to dive in a chamber, usually a member of a diving team allocated to looking after the diver being treated.
== Research ==
Aspects under research include radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis; and inflammatory bowel disease, rejuvenation.

Some research found evidence that HBOT improves local tumor control, mortality, and local tumor recurrence for cancers of the head and neck.

Some research also found evidence of an increase in stem progenitor cells and a decrease in inflammation.

=== Neurological ===
Tentative evidence shows a possible benefit in cerebrovascular diseases. Rats subjected to HBOT after some time following the acute phase of experimentally-induced stroke showed reduced inflammation, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and evidence of neurogenesis. Another rat study showed improved neurofunctional recovery as well as neurogenesis following the late-chronic phase of experimentally-induced stroke.

The clinical experience and results so far published has promoted the use of HBOT therapy in patients with cerebrovascular injury and focal cerebrovascular injuries. However, the power of clinical research is limited because of the shortage of randomized controlled trials.

=== Radiation wounds ===
A 2010 review of studies of HBOT applied to wounds from radiation therapy reported that, while most studies suggest a beneficial effect, more experimental and clinical research is needed to validate its clinical use.

==History==
===Hyperbaric air===
Junod built a chamber in France in 1834 to treat pulmonary conditions at pressures between 2 and 4 atmospheres absolute.

During the following century &quot;pneumatic centres&quot; were established in Europe and the USA which used hyperbaric air to treat a variety of conditions.

Orval J Cunningham, a professor of anesthesia at the University of Kansas in the early 1900s observed that people with circulatory disorders did better at sea level than at altitude and this formed the basis for his use of hyperbaric air. In 1918, he successfully treated patients with the Spanish flu with hyperbaric air. In 1930 the American Medical Association forced him to stop hyperbaric treatment, since he did not provide acceptable evidence that the treatments were effective.

===Hyperbaric oxygen===
The English scientist Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen in 1775. Shortly after its discovery, there were reports of toxic effects of hyperbaric oxygen on the central nervous system and lungs, which delayed therapeutic applications until 1937, when Behnke and Shaw first used it in the treatment of decompression sickness.

In 1955 and 1956 Churchill-Davidson, in the UK, used hyperbaric oxygen to enhance the radiosensitivity of tumours, while , at the University of Amsterdam, successfully used it in cardiac surgery.

In 1961 et al. published on the use of hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of clostridial gas gangrene.

In 1962 Smith and Sharp reported successful treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning with hyperbaric oxygen.

The Undersea Medical Society (now Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society) formed a Committee on Hyperbaric Oxygenation which has become recognized as the authority on indications for hyperbaric oxygen treatment.

== Incidents ==
Fires inside a hyperbaric chamber are extremely dangerous. A review article published in 1997 found 77 human fatalities in 35 different hyperbaric chamber fires that occurred from 1923 to 1996. Further studies indicate while the treatment is often considered safe, the use of hyperbaric equipment comes with risks to the operating personnel when improperly used. Proper equipment maintenance and safety procedures for the use of pressure equipment is mandatory.

* 1997: Ten patients and a nurse were killed in Milan, Italy after a fire broke out inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.
* 2009: A grandmother and her four year old grandson died after a hyperbaric chamber caught fire and exploded in Florida. The boy was receiving treatment in the chamber for cerebral palsy and had traveled from Italy where the treatment is outlawed to undergo the procedure.
* 2012: A hyperbaric oxygen chamber exploded in Florida, killing a woman and a thoroughbred horse who was receiving treatment. The explosion occurred after the horse kicked out at the chamber, creating sparks which ignited a fire.
* 2015: A dog was killed in Georgia when the chamber it was receiving treatment in caught fire and exploded. The dog was being treated for arthritis.
* 2016: A fire killed four people who were receiving treatment inside a hyperbaric chamber at Mintohardjo Navy Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. The fire was reportedly caused by an electrical short circuit. After the fire broke out, operators used a sprinkler system and an emergency shut off system to rescue the victims, but live-saving efforts were prevented as the machine became engulfed in flames.
* 2016: A man in Victoria, Australia died in a hyperbaric chamber of undisclosed causes while receiving treatment. The practitioners overseeing his care were found responsible for failing to ensure the patient&#x27;s safety leading to his death. They were later fined AU$716,750.
* 2025: A hyperbaric chamber exploded in Michigan, killing a five year old boy.

<text>Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (born Lawrence Joshua Chamberlain, September 8, 1828February 24, 1914) was an American college professor and politician from Maine who volunteered during the American Civil War to join the Union Army. He became a highly respected and decorated Union officer, reaching the rank of brigadier general (and brevet major general). He is best known for his gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg, leading a bayonet charge, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

Chamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862, and fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. He became commander of the regiment in June 1863 when losses at the Battle of Chancellorsville elevated the original commander, Colonel Adelbert Ames, to brigade command. During the second day&#x27;s fighting at Gettysburg on July 2, Chamberlain&#x27;s regiment occupied the extreme left of the Union lines at Little Round Top. Chamberlain&#x27;s men withstood repeated assaults from the 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment and finally drove the Confederates away with a downhill bayonet charge. Chamberlain was severely wounded while commanding a brigade during the Second Battle of Petersburg in June 1864, and was given what was intended to be a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. In April 1865, he fought at the Battle of Five Forks and was given the honor of commanding the Union troops at the surrender ceremony for the infantry of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.

After the war, he entered politics as a Republican and served four one-year terms of office as the 32nd Governor of Maine from 1867 to 1871. After leaving office, he returned to his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Bowdoin College, serving as its president until 1883. He died in 1914 at age 85 due to complications from the wound that he received at Petersburg.

==Early life and education==
Chamberlain was born in Brewer, Maine, the son of Sarah Dupee (née Brastow) and Joshua Chamberlain, on September 8, 1828. Chamberlain was of English ancestry and his family could be traced back to twelfth-century England, during the reign of King Stephen. Chamberlain&#x27;s great-grandfather Ebenezer, was a New Hampshire soldier in the French and Indian War, and the American Revolutionary War. Chamberlain&#x27;s grandfather, Joshua, was a ship builder and colonel during the War of 1812, notably involved at the Battle of Hampden, before moving his family to a Brewer farm in 1817. Chamberlain&#x27;s father Joshua served as a lieutenant colonel in the Aroostook War.

Chamberlain was the first of five children. His father named him after James Lawrence, and favored a military career for his son, while Chamberlain&#x27;s mother wanted him to become a minister. Chamberlain became a member of the Congregational Church in Brewer in the mid-1840s, and attended Major Whiting&#x27;s military academy in Ellsworth. Chamberlain then taught himself Greek so he could be admitted to Bowdoin College in 1848. At college, Chamberlain was a member of the Peucinian Society, Phi Beta Kappa, and the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. He taught Sunday school in Brunswick during his freshman and sophomore years, and led the choir at the Congregational Church-First Parish Church during his Junior and Senior years. Chamberlain graduated in 1852, then entered the Bangor Theological Seminary for three years of study. He remained a Calvinist and a conservative Congregationalist throughout his life. Besides studying Latin and German, Chamberlain eventually mastered French, Arabic, Hebrew and Syriac.

On December 7, 1855, Chamberlain married Fanny Adams, cousin and adopted daughter of a local clergyman. Their first child was a girl named Grace Dupee, born on October 16, 1856. Their son Harold Wylls was born on October 10, 1858. A second and fourth child died early. In the fall of 1855, Chamberlain returned to Bowdoin, and began a career in education, first as an instructor in logic and natural theology, then as professor of rhetoric and oratory. He eventually went on to teach every subject in the curriculum with the exception of science and mathematics. In 1861 he was appointed professor of modern languages, which he held until 1865.

==American Civil War==
===Early career===

At the beginning of the American Civil War, Chamberlain believed the Union needed to be supported against the Confederacy by all those willing. On several occasions, Chamberlain spoke freely of his beliefs during his class, urging students to follow their hearts in regards to the war while maintaining that the cause was just. Of his desire to serve in the War, he wrote to Maine&#x27;s Governor Israel Washburn, Jr., &quot;I fear, this war, so costly of blood and treasure, will not cease until men of the North are willing to leave good positions, and sacrifice the dearest personal interests, to rescue our country from desolation, and defend the national existence against treachery.&quot; Many faculty at Bowdoin did not feel his enthusiasm for various reasons and Chamberlain was subsequently granted a leave of absence (supposedly to study languages for two years in Europe). He then promptly enlisted unbeknownst to his family and those at Bowdoin. Offered the colonelcy of the 20th Maine Regiment, he declined, according to his biographer, John J. Pullen, preferring to &quot;start a little lower and learn the business first.&quot; He was appointed lieutenant colonel of the regiment on August 8, 1862, under the command of Col. Adelbert Ames. The 20th was assigned to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps in the Union Army of the Potomac. One of Chamberlain&#x27;s younger brothers, Thomas Chamberlain, was also an officer of the 20th Maine, and another, John Chamberlain, visited the regiment at Gettysburg as a member of the U.S. Christian Commission until appointed as a chaplain in another Maine Volunteer regiment.

The 20th Maine fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg, suffering relatively small numbers of casualties in the assaults on Marye&#x27;s Heights, but were forced to spend a miserable night on the freezing battlefield among the many wounded from other regiments. Chamberlain chronicled this night well in his diary and went to great length discussing his having to use bodies of the fallen for shelter and a pillow while listening to the bullets zip into the corpses.

The 20th missed the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863 due to an outbreak of smallpox in their ranks (which was caused by an errant smallpox vaccine), keeping them on guard duty in the rear. Chamberlain was promoted to colonel of the regiment in June 1863 upon the promotion of Ames.

====Battle of Gettysburg====
Chamberlain became most famous for his achievements during the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 2, the second day of the battle, Union forces were recovering from initial setbacks and hastily regrouping into defensive positions on a line of hills south of the town. Sensing the momentary vulnerability of the Union forces, the Confederates began an attack against the Union left flank. Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade, commanded by Col. Strong Vincent, was sent to defend Little Round Top by the army&#x27;s Chief of Engineers, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren. Chamberlain found himself and the 20th Maine at the far left end of the entire Union line. He quickly understood the strategic significance of the small hill, and the need for the 20th Maine to hold the Union left at all costs. The men from Maine waited until troops from the 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment, commanded by Col. William C. Oates, charged up the hill, attempting to flank the Union position. Time and time again the Confederates struck, until the 20th Maine was almost doubled back upon itself. With many casualties and ammunition running low, Col. Chamberlain recognized the dire circumstances and ordered his left wing (which was now looking southeast, compared to the rest of the regiment, which was facing west) to initiate a bayonet charge. From his report of the day: &quot;At that crisis, I ordered the bayonet. The word was enough.&quot; While battlefield conditions make it unlikely that many men heard Chamberlain&#x27;s order, most historians believe he initiated the charge.

The 20th Maine charged down the hill, with the left wing wheeling continually to make the charging line swing like a hinge, thus creating a simultaneous frontal assault and flanking maneuver, capturing 101 of the Confederate soldiers and successfully saving the flank. This version of the battle was popularized by the book &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; and the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. Chamberlain sustained one slight wound in the battle, when a shot hit his scabbard and bruised his thigh. After initiating the maneuver, he came upon a Confederate officer wielding a revolver who quickly fired, narrowly missing his face. Chamberlain remained steadfast, and with his sword at the officer&#x27;s throat accepted the man&#x27;s arms and surrender. The pistol Chamberlain captured at Gettysburg can still be seen on display in the Civil War exhibit of the Maine State Museum. For his tenacity at defending Little Round Top, he was known by the sobriquet &quot;Lion of the Round Top.&quot; Prior to the battle, Chamberlain was quite ill, developing malaria and dysentery. Later, due to this illness, he was taken off active duty until he recovered.

For his &quot;daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top&quot;, Chamberlain was awarded the Medal of Honor.

=====Medal of Honor citation=====
====Siege of Petersburg====
In April 1864, Chamberlain returned to the Army of the Potomac and was promoted to brigade commander shortly before the Siege of Petersburg and given command of the 1st Brigade, First Division, V Corps. In a major action on June 18, during the Second Battle of Petersburg, Chamberlain was shot through the right hip and groin, the bullet exiting his left hip. Despite the injury, Chamberlain withdrew his sword and stuck it into the ground in order to keep himself upright to dissuade the growing resolve for retreat. He stood upright for several minutes until he collapsed and lay unconscious from loss of blood. The wound was considered mortal by the division&#x27;s surgeon, who predicted he would perish; Chamberlain&#x27;s incorrectly recorded death in battle was reported in the Maine newspapers, and Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant gave Chamberlain a battlefield promotion to the rank of brigadier general after receiving an urgent recommendation on June 19 from corps commander Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren: &quot;He has been recommended for promotion for gallant and efficient conduct on previous occasion and yesterday led his brigade against the enemy under most destructive fire. He expresses the wish that he may receive the recognition of his services by promotion before he dies for the gratification of his family and friends.&quot; Not expected to live, Chamberlain displayed surprising will and courage, and with the support of his brother Tom, was back in command by November. Although many, including his wife Fanny, urged Chamberlain to resign, he was determined to serve through the end of the war.

In early 1865, Chamberlain regained command of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of V Corps, and he continued to act with courage and resolve. On March 29, 1865, his brigade participated in a major skirmish on the Quaker Road during Grant&#x27;s final advance that would finish the war. Despite losses, another wound (in the left arm and chest that almost caused amputation), and nearly being captured, Chamberlain was successful and brevetted to the rank of major general by President Abraham Lincoln. Chamberlain gained the name &quot;Bloody Chamberlain&quot; at Quaker Road. Chamberlain kept a Bible and framed picture of his wife in his left front chest pocket. When a Confederate shot at Chamberlain, the bullet went through his horse&#x27;s neck, hit the picture frame, entered under Chamberlain&#x27;s skin in the front of his chest, traveled around his body under the skin along the rib, and exited his back. To all observers Union and Confederate, it appeared that he was shot through his chest. He continued to encourage his men to attack.

====Appomattox====
On the morning of April 9, 1865, Chamberlain learned of the desire by General Robert E. Lee to surrender the Army of Northern Virginia when a Confederate staff officer approached him under a flag of truce. &quot;Sir,&quot; he reported to Chamberlain, &quot;I am from General Gordon. General Lee desires a cessation of hostilities until he can hear from General Grant as to the proposed surrender.&quot; The next day, Chamberlain was summoned to Union headquarters where Maj. Gen. Charles Griffin informed him that he had been selected to preside over the parade of the Confederate infantry as part of their formal surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 12.

Chamberlain was thus responsible for one of the most poignant scenes of the American Civil War. As the Confederate soldiers marched down the road to surrender their arms and colors, Chamberlain, on his own initiative, ordered his men to come to attention and &quot;carry arms&quot; as a show of respect. In memoirs written forty years after the event, Chamberlain described what happened next:

Chamberlain stated that his salute to the Confederate soldiers was unpopular with many Unionists, but he defended his action in his posthumously published 1915 memoir &quot;The Passing of the Armies&quot;. Gordon, in his own memoirs, called Chamberlain &quot;one of the knightliest soldiers of the Federal Army.&quot; Arguing that Gordon never mentioned the anecdote until after he read Chamberlain&#x27;s account more than 40 years later, at least one writer has questioned the historicity of Chamberlain and Gordon&#x27;s account (e.g., S.C. Gwynne, &quot;Hymns of the Republic: The Story of the Final Year of the American Civil War&quot; (p. 298)), but eminent historians such as James McPherson believe that the events in question occurred as Chamberlain described (e.g., &#x27; &#x27;James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom&#x27; &#x27; (p. 850)).

In all, Chamberlain served in 20 battles and numerous skirmishes, was cited for bravery four times, had six horses shot from under him, and was wounded six times.

==Post-war service==
Chamberlain left the U.S. Army soon after the war ended, going back to his home state of Maine. Due to his immense popularity, he served as Governor of Maine for four one-year terms after he won election as a Republican. His victory in 1866 set the record for the most votes and the highest percentage for any Maine governor by that time. He would break his own record in 1868. During his time in office, he was attacked by those angered by his support for capital punishment and by his refusal to create a special police force to enforce the prohibition of alcohol.








In January 1880, there was a dispute about who was the newly elected governor of Maine, and the Maine State House was occupied by a band of armed men. The outgoing governor, Alonzo Garcelon, summoned Chamberlain, the commander of the Maine Militia, to take charge. Chamberlain sent home the armed men, and arranged for the Augusta police to keep control. He stayed in the State House most of the twelve-day period until the Maine Supreme Judicial Court&#x27;s decision on the election results was known. During this time, there were threats of assassination and kidnapping, and on one occasion, he went outside to face down a crowd of 25–30 men intending to kill him, and both sides offered bribes to appoint him a United States senator. Having gratified neither side in the dispute, he did not become a senator, and his career in state politics ended.

After leaving political office, he returned to Bowdoin College. He was originally offered the presidency of the new state university in Orono, but declined, hoping for the same position at his alma mater. That came in 1871, he was appointed president of Bowdoin and remained in that position until 1883, when he was forced to resign because of ill health from his war wounds. He also served as an ex-officio trustee of nearby Bates College from 1867 to 1871.

==Later life==
After resigning from Bowdoin in 1883, he went to New York City to practice law. Chamberlain served as Surveyor of the Port of Portland, Maine, a federal appointment, and engaged in business activities, including real estate dealings in Florida (1885) and a college of art in New York, as well as hotels. He traveled to the West Coast to work on railroad building and public improvements. From the time of his serious wound in 1864 until his death, he was forced to wear an early form of a catheter with a bag and underwent six operations to try to correct the original wound and stop the fevers and infections that plagued him, without success.
In 1893, 30 years after the battle that made the 20th Maine famous, Chamberlain was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Gettysburg. The citation commends him for his &quot;Daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top.&quot; As in many other Civil War actions, controversy arose when one of his subordinate officers stated that Chamberlain never actually ordered a charge at Gettysburg. The claim never seriously affected Chamberlain&#x27;s fame or notability however. This original medal was lost, and later rediscovered in 2013, and donated to the Pejepscot Historical Society in Brunswick, Maine. A second, redesigned medal issued in 1904 is currently housed at Bowdoin College.

In 1898, Chamberlain at the age of 70, volunteered to command US Army forces in the Spanish American War. Despite the support of Acting Secretary of War Russell Alger and President William McKinley, he was passed over due to health issues. Ironically, his principal opponent at Gettysburg, William C. Oates, was appointed in his place as a Brigadier General of US Volunteers.

In 1905, Chamberlain became a founding member of the Maine Institution for the Blind, in Portland, now called The Iris Network. Chamberlain&#x27;s wife herself was visually impaired, which led him to serve on the organization&#x27;s first board of directors.

Beginning with his first election as governor of Maine and continuing to the end of his life, Chamberlain was active in the Grand Army of the Republic. Despite continual pain and discomfort from his wounds of 1864, he made many return visits to Gettysburg and delivered speeches at soldiers&#x27; reunions. He made his last known visit on May 16 and 17, 1913, while involved in planning the 50th anniversary reunion. Because of deteriorating health, he was unable to attend the reunion less than two months later.

==Death==
Chamberlain died of his lingering wartime wounds in 1914 in Portland, Maine, at the age of eighty-five. He is interred at Pine Grove Cemetery in Brunswick, Maine. Beside him as he died was Dr. Abner O. Shaw of Portland, one of the two surgeons who had operated on him in Petersburg 50 years previously. A full study of his medical history strongly suggests that it was complications from the wound suffered at Petersburg that resulted in his death. He was the last Civil War veteran to die as a result of wounds from the war and considered by some the last casualty of the war.

==Legacy==


Chamberlain&#x27;s home, located across Maine Street from the Bowdoin College campus, is now the Joshua L. Chamberlain Museum and is owned by the Pejepscot Historical Society, which maintains an extensive research collection on Chamberlain. Memorabilia on display include the minié ball that almost ended his life at Petersburg, his original Medal of Honor, and Don Troiani&#x27;s original painting of the charge at Little Round Top. Tours of the home are conducted by volunteer docents from late May until mid-October.

US Route 1A is carried across the Penobscot River between Bangor and Brewer, Maine, by the Joshua Chamberlain Bridge, a two-lane steel plate girder bridge opened on November 11, 1954.

The village of Chamberlain, Maine, in the town of Bristol, is named for him.

=== Medal of Honor===
In September 2013, the original Medal of Honor awarded to Chamberlain in 1893 was donated to the Pejepscot Historical Society, which owns the Joshua L. Chamberlain Museum in Brunswick, after being authenticated by the Maine State Museum, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Awards and Decorations Branch of the Department of the Army. The donor, who chose to remain anonymous, found it in the back of a book bought during a church sale at the First Parish Church in Duxbury, Massachusetts; Chamberlain&#x27;s granddaughter Rosamond Allen, his last surviving descendant, had donated her estate to that church upon her death in 2000. Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot; of Bowdoin College has a 1904 Medal of Honor belonging to Chamberlain in its possession. The original 1893 medal is on display at the Chamberlain Museum.

==In popular culture==
Chamberlain emerged as a key character in Michael Shaara&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning historical novel about Gettysburg, &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; (1974), and in a prequel novel by his son, Jeff Shaara, &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; (1996). Chamberlain is portrayed by actor Jeff Daniels in the films &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993) and &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; (2003), based on the books. His portrayal in these books and films significantly enhanced Chamberlain&#x27;s reputation in the general public, making him into a more popular and well known figure.

Tom Eishen&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Courage on Little Round Top&quot; is a detailed look at Chamberlain as well as Robert Wicker, the young Confederate officer who fired his pistol at Chamberlain&#x27;s head during the 20th Maine&#x27;s historic charge down Little Round Top.

Ken Burns&#x27;s 1990 nine-part PBS film &quot;The Civil War&quot; featured Chamberlain prominently.

Steve Earle&#x27;s song &quot;Dixieland&quot; from his album &quot;The Mountain&quot; refers to Chamberlain and the Battle of Gettysburg:

The book &quot;The Lost Regiment&quot; and the subsequent series by author William R. Forstchen chronicle the adventures of the &quot;35th Maine&quot;, a Union regiment from Maine having been transported to an alien planet. The regiment was based on the 20th Maine, with the main character and commander of the regiment, Andrew Lawrence Keane, also being a college professor.

In the alternate history 2003 novel &quot;&quot;, written by Forstchen and Newt Gingrich, Chamberlain is featured as a character. In the book, an alternate history of the Civil War, Chamberlain makes a heroic stand similar to the real life battle on Little Round Top. Unlike in real life, Chamberlain is overwhelmed, wounded, and forced to surrender, but he survives and returns in the third book of the series, &quot;Never Call Retreat&quot; (2005).

A musical, &quot;Chamberlain: A Civil War Romance&quot;, with book and lyrics by Sarah Knapp and music by Steven M. Alper was commissioned by Maine State Music Theatre in 1993 and received its premiere at that theatre in July, 1996. That production starred Mark Jacoby as Chamberlain and Sarah Knapp as Fannie Chamberlain. It was revived in a revised form by Maine State in 2014. According to its bookwriter, the musical is &quot;an exploration of the perennial conflict between public duty and private devotion. This musical ... not only celebrates a great Civil War hero, but also examines a universal theme: How a person&#x27;s sense of duty and destiny affect his personal life.&quot;

Another Forstchen work, &quot;A Hard Day For Mother&quot;, is a short story from the first volume in the variety anthology series &quot;Alternate Generals&quot; edited by Harry Turtledove. That work is based on the premise of: &quot;what if Chamberlain was on the Confederate side at Gettysburg?&quot; The story assumes that a decade before the outbreak of the Civil War Chamberlain had taken a teaching job at a Virginia military academy and developed a love for the state of Virginia; that with the outbreak of war he joined the Confederate side under Robert E. Lee; that in Gettysburg he gained the Little Round Top for the Confederacy, fighting against his own brother Tom commanding the 20th Maine; that thereby Chamberlain won the battle and the entire war for the Confederacy; that he later remained in the independent Confederacy and was eventually elected its President; and that his reconciliatory attitude towards the North led to Confederacy and the United States eventually holding referendums and freely deciding to re-unite in 1914, following Chamberlain&#x27;s death.

On the Showtime TV series &quot;Homeland&quot;, the character Nicholas Brody tells his family the story of Chamberlain, encouraging them to emulate him.

In the song &quot;Ballad of the 20th Maine&quot; by The Ghost of Paul Revere (Maine&#x27;s official state ballad):
The book Percy Jackson and the Sea Of Monsters by author Rick Riordan hints at Chamberlain being a demigod, stating that he single-handedly changed the course of the Civil War.

<doc id="326494" wikidata="Q1950866" url="?curid=326494" title="Recluse spider">
<text>The recluse spiders (&quot;Loxosceles&quot; (), also known as brown spiders, fiddle-backs, violin spiders, and reapers, is a genus of spiders that was first described by R. T. Lowe in 1832. They are venomous spiders known for their bite, which sometimes produces a characteristic set of symptoms known as loxoscelism.

Recluse spiders are now identified as members of the family Sicariidae, having formerly been placed in their own family, the Loxoscelidae. Although recluse spiders are feared, they are usually not aggressive.

==Relation with other spiders==
Sicariidae are of the superfamily Scytodoidea. Other families in the Scytodoidea include Drymusidae, Scytodidae, and Periegopidae.

==Habitat and appearance==
&quot;Loxosceles&quot; is distributed nearly worldwide in warmer areas. All have six eyes arranged in three groups of two (dyads) and some are brownish with a darker brown characteristic violin marking on the cephalothorax. However, the &quot;violin marking&quot; cannot be used as a reliable way to identify the spider as many unrelated species of spider have similar markings. Recluses are typically about 7–12 mm long.

The most common and most famous species in the United States is the brown recluse spider (&quot;Loxosceles reclusa&quot;). It is found in a large area of the Midwest, west to Colorado and the New Mexico state line and east to northern Georgia. Sporadic records from other locations only represent incidental introductions, not established populations. The brown recluse feeds on whatever small prey is available, and has been observed to prefer scavenging over actively hunting. Other notable members of this genus include the Chilean recluse spider (&quot;L. laeta&quot;) and the Mediterranean recluse spider (&quot;L. rufescens&quot;).

Recently, concerns have been raised regarding recluses spreading faster due to warmer air carrying them farther as a result of changing climate. On the contrary, newly hatched recluses do not travel via ballooning and thus the populations are confined to very tight spaces with dense populations. Most &quot;Loxosceles&quot; can live for one and a half to two years. Many species of this genus can live for very long times without food or water. Insecticides often fail to kill the spider, instead intoxicating its nervous system and inducing erratic behavior.

== Identification ==
This genus is very hard to identify, as they have very simple coloration and morphology. Many other spiders have similar dorsal markings, leading to confusion and misidentification. They can be most readily distinguished by having 6 eyes, arranged in three pairs. None of the pairs of eyes touch each other, and are arranged in a U shape. The presence of two claws per foot and a rather flat cephalothorax further help distinguish them.

==Venom components and effects==
&quot;Loxosceles&quot; spiders, like &quot;Hexophthalma&quot; species, have potent tissue-destroying venoms containing the dermonecrotic agent which is otherwise found only in a few pathogenic bacteria. Recent research has indicated the venom is composed largely of sulfated nucleosides, though these compounds are relatively new discoveries, so little is known about them. The venom of several species is capable of producing necrotic lesions that are slow to heal and may require skin grafts. Rarely, the venom is carried by the bloodstream, causing red blood cell destruction.

The venom is identical in male and female spiders, but females can have almost twice the concentration of toxins. For unknown reasons, the toxicity of the venom to mammalian species varies; recluse bites may cause necrosis in humans, rabbits, and guinea pigs, but not in mice or rats.

The Chilean recluse (&quot;L. laeta&quot;) supposedly has a more potent venom, which results in systemic involvement more often. All &quot;Loxosceles&quot; species that have been tested have venoms similar to that of the brown recluse, and all should be avoided. In general, though, they are not aggressive and commonly occupy human dwellings without causing problems.

Many types of skin wounds are mistaken for or assumed to be the result of a recluse spider bite. Several diseases can mimic the lesions of the bite, including Lyme disease, various fungal and bacterial infections, and the first sore of syphilis. It is important to associate the spider directly with the bite to avoid improper treatment, and to successfully treat common infections or other conditions if no spider was seen.

Bites most often occur as a defense when the spider is trapped against the skin, in clothing, for example. The total volume of venom is minute (only 2 micrograms injected out of 4 microliters in the venom glands).

The bite of a recluse spider can generally be categorized into one of the following groups:
* Unremarkable – self-healing minute damage
* Mild reaction – self-healing damage with itchiness, redness, patterns of aggressive behavior and a mild lesion.
* Dermonecrotic – the uncommon, &quot;classic&quot; recluse bite, producing a necrotic skin lesion. About 66% of necrotic bite lesions heal with no complications. In extreme cases, the lesion may be up to 40 millimeters wide, last for several months, and heal with a permanent scar.
* Systemic or viscerocutaneous – an extremely rare, systemic reaction to envenomation of the bloodstream. It is observed more often in children.

Most bites are unremarkable or mild.

<doc id="326495" wikidata="Q42094" url="?curid=326495" title="Mokpo">
<text>Mokpo (; ) is the third largest and most densely populated city in South Jeolla Province, South Korea, located at the southwestern tip of the Korean Peninsula, close to Yudal mountain. Mokpo has frequent high-speed train services to Seoul, and is the terminus for a number of ferry routes serving islands in the adjacent Yellow Sea and Dadohae National Maritime Park. To the southwest of the city is Yudalsan Mountain, which is surrounded by strange cliffs like a wall. There are six populated and five uninhabited islands.

The Mokpo Special Tourist Zone covers from the northern port to Yudalsan, Old Town Area, Samhakdo, and Gatbawi. It is home to attractions such as the Mokpo Natural History Museum and the National Maritime Museum. To live up to its name as a coastal city, the city&#x27;s traditional dishes include a variety of seafood dishes, including raw croaker, braised hairtail, skate, and seasoned crab.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Mokpo&quot; means literally &quot;tree harbor&quot;. This terminology initially appeared in the &quot;Goryeosa&quot; (&quot;History of Goryeo&quot;). Therefore, some historians argue that the city&#x27;s name referred to trees within the region of the port of Mokpo. Another theory suggests that the &quot;mok&quot; in the city&#x27;s name refers to &quot;the throat,&quot; a metaphor for the importance of the city&#x27;s location as an entrance to the Yellow Sea.

== History ==

=== Mahan and Three Kingdoms eras ===
Mokpo belonged to the Mahan confederacy during the early era of the three Han confederacies during the Samhan period, and was called Mul&#x27;ahye-gun while under the control of the Baekje kingdom. After Silla defeated Baekje, Mokpo&#x27;s region was absorbed, and its name was changed to Myeonju. In 946, its name was once again changed to Mullyang-gun, and it became part of the Muan prefecture, in the Haeyang province. At the time, the prefecture of Muan referred to a much larger area, which incorporated not only Mokpo but also the area currently called Muan and several islands of Sinan county. According to a KBS documentary, coastal and offshore areas of Mokpo witnessed superior productivity of crops, and important shipping routes to Naju were established along the Yeongsan River.

=== Goryeo and Joseon dynasties ===
What is today known as Mokpo had its origins in the Goryeo period. That dynasty&#x27;s founder, Wang Geon, was serving as a general for later Goguryeo (also known as Taebong), ruled by Gung Ye. Taebong covered the central area of the Korean peninsula including current-day Gaeseong, which was then called Song&#x27;ak.

As a naval power, Wang Geon was ordered to attack the kingdom of Later Baekje, which, like later Goguryeo, was a kingdom which emerged after the disintegration of Unified Silla. The operation met fairly successful results. During this time, Wang Geon met his second queen, Queen Janghwa, with whom he had a son, who eventually became Hyejong of Goryeo.

In 1439, 21 years after King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty came to power, the Mokpo garrison (jin) was established, which was designed to control twelve offshore islands. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), Admiral Yi Sun-sin established a garrison of naval forces at Mokpo and the island of Goha, to secure a base for provisions and ship repairs, such as the turtle ships, also known as the geobukseon and panokseon.

=== Open port ===
On 1 October 1897, Mokpo became an open port, fifteen years after the opening of the port of Incheon. For Japan, Mokpo held a geographical advantage being located midway between Nagasaki, Japan, and the Chinese mainland. Japan also valued Mokpo for its proximity to the abundant crops of the Jeolla provinces. After its opening, housing for Japanese settlers was rapidly developed to establish self-government. The Japanese settled predominately in what is today the Yudal-dong neighborhood, close to the main port. The Japanese consulate remained there until the establishment of the Japanese protectorate over Korea.

The Japanese settlers gradually bought farmland in the vicinity of Mokpo, which had previously been illegal. These agricultural fields were desirable because they were inexpensive and not heavily taxed. The resulting harvests from these fields made rice cheaper in Japan, although the price of rice in Jeolla province doubled as a result. After 1905, the influx of Japanese settlers increased and they expanded into Geumhwa-dong, where many cherry trees were planted along the street. Japanese called this area &quot;Sakuramachi&quot;, which means &quot;the downtown of cherry blossom trees.&quot; With Korea&#x27;s full annexation by Japan in 1910, the city was given a new name, Mokpo-bu, and saw the construction of the colonial institution, the Oriental Development Company.

=== Under Japanese rule ===

Mokpo&#x27;s status as an open port made it a viable option to use the nearby county of Wando as a link to the region&#x27;s many offshore islands. In 1914, the completion of the Honam railway line connected the city to Daejeon. On 1 April 1914, the county of Mokpo-bu was divided into several administrative sections. Only the county&#x27;s urban downtown area, Bunae-myeon, became what is today Mokpo City. Following Order Number 11 of the General Japanese Government of Korea, Muan county incorporated Jido, Palguem, and Docho, which were the other areas formerly comprising Mokpo-bu. During the Japanese colonial period, Mokpo&#x27;s harbor was used to forcibly export the produce of the region.

In 1918, the colonists established ginning facilities for manufacturing large amounts of goods in both Mokpo and Iri (current Iksan in North Jeolla province). In 1932, the city incorporated parts of Muan, becoming the 6th largest city in the Korean peninsula with a population of 60,000. Indigenous products were cloth, rice, salt, and coastal foods. The harbor played an important role, supplying goods to Japan, including large quantities of cotton.

=== After independence ===
In 1949, Mokpo-Bu was redesignated Mokpo City, after the government altered the administrative region. In 1973 and 1987, large areas were added to Mokpo city, including one of the most famous tourist spots, Samhakdo (Three Crane Island). Samhakdo was reclaimed by connecting a series of islands, a process of landfill operations which lasted from 1968 to 1973. The island is divided into three major sections, and over six years the city constructed five bridges to link those three sections. In 2000, the city initiated a plan to restore a naturalized island for tourism, which brought tremendous criticism from environmental groups. On 1 March 2007, Samhakdo was opened to the public. Other projects in Mokpo included a coastal filling process near the North Harbor and the building of a new port in Chungmu-dong.

In 1980, the Gwangju Democratization Movement swept the area. In Mokpo, student movements were initiated by several people marching along the boulevard from Mokpo Station to the second plaza, carrying cards displaying the word &quot;Freedom.&quot; Mokpo Station served as a hub for many groups supporting the people of Gwangju.

On 1 October 1997, Mokpo celebrated its centennial as a port city, and announced the second opening of the port. Mokpo is the hometown of former President Kim Dae-jung, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.

Following the sinking of MV Sewol on 16 April 2014, the ship was moved to Mokpo for salvage operations.

== Administration ==
=== Mayor ===
Mokpo began its local government in 1994. In July 1995 it inaugurated its first mayor, Gwon I Dam, who had been the president of the Munhwa broadcasting corporation. The city&#x27;s lack of supply in the past caused Gwon to focus on improving the city&#x27;s water supplies. In 2000, the mayor officially provided aid for North Korea in the form of rice shipments. However, Gwon came into conflict with the leaders of the Democratic Party over fair election practices, causing him to leave the party. He filed a lawsuit against the Democratic Party, which the courts subsequently rejected.

Jeon Tae Hong, the next mayor, made some important contributions to Mokpo&#x27;s government, but he died suddenly in 2005. Following his death, Jeong Jong Deuk was elected mayor, promising protection of the tourism industry. Once in office, Deuk responded to concerns about the depressed condition of the old downtown area by establishing the Office of Original City Replanning and adopted the slogan &quot;City of Light.&quot;

Deuk was re-elected in 2006 and, during his second term, the city received several civil and tourism awards. He faced criticism from the local press regarding Mokpo&#x27;s ability to draw people into the city and changing the attitudes regarding the city&#x27;s imbalanced economy.

Another dispute arose in 2009, when non-governmental organizations based in Mokpo sued the government to disclose information about budgetary spending, which had been controlled by a city committee chosen by the mayor. The courts sided with the organizations, saying that the budget plan should be reported and monitored.

=== Disputes upon merge ===
In 2004, civil groups promoted merging the three adjacent communities: Sinan, Muan and Mokpo. On 25 September 2009, the city council of Mokpo officially submitted a plan to merge into one central government, but the plan was voted down due to objections from the community.

=== Population ===
In 2007, the population of Mokpo had increased to 90,000 households, with an average of 2.7 people per household. The population density was the 10th highest in South Korea, and it was the second fastest-growing region (after Gyeonggi Province). In 2010, the Bank of Korea reported that the population of western South Jeolla province was declining due to several economic, social and educational issues.

== Education ==

One of the oldest elementary schools, Bukgyo, was established in 1897 for the aristocracy during the Joseon period, following Order No. 145 of Gojong. However, after its annexation by Japan, education in Mokpo was directed towards Japanese students.

Mokpo Commercial High School opened in 1920 as the first secondary-level school. Its name was later changed to Jeonnam Jeil High School. Former president Kim Dae Jung graduated from Jeil.

=== Universities ===
Mokpo National University (MNU) became a nationally supported school in 1976, after 30 years of existence. The school has become regionally famous for its shipbuilding research and other culturally related fields of study. A 2007 study of national universities ranked MNU highly, equal with Seoul National University and Jeonnam National University. Mokpo National Maritime University is a government-funded school specializing in maritime-related studies. Mokpo Catholic University was established in 1967 as Sungshin Nursing College, and later expanded its vocational training to include other fields.

== Economy ==

The harbor began operations earlier than other port cities on the Korean peninsula, allowing the city to experience growth, whereas growth in the country since its independence has concentrated on the Yeongnam area, where trade with Japan and Russia are viable due to the access of coastal routes. The addition of the Chinese economy into the local trade prospects increases the city&#x27;s potential as a trade center via the Yellow Sea.

=== Commerce ===

Until late 1980s, commerce had been concentrated around the original downtown near Mokpo Station. In the late 1990s, large residential areas were built in Yeonsan dong and Hadang, resulting in a significant outflow of the population of the city. This resulted in the city council adopting a bylaw to support the old downtown area, however, the outward flow has only worsened.

Economic power has been notably imbalanced by the opening of Lotte Mart in 2001 and E-Mart in 2002. Home plus is the solitary large-scale market in Mokpo, located in old downtown near the Munhwa broadcasting corporation.

The one exception to the declining economy of the city are the fish markets of Dongmyeong and North Harbor which have been a magnet for tourists and local people looking for octopus or other indigenous products. The economic bureau of the city has spent ₩300 million on promoting the market since early 2009.

=== Companies ===
Companies with operations in Mokpo include the Bohae brewing company and Haengnam chinaware. Bohae Brewing Company produces a brand of soju from the Honam area, of which the best selling product is maple soju (), the first company to using maple in the brewing of soju. Bohae also entered into a joint development with Asahi Breweries in Japan to expand its soju production operations. In 2008, Bohae became the first Korean brewing company to open up wine sales in the United States, with the exportation of its Rugby Ball wine.

Another major company is Haengnam chinaware, established in May 1942. Its headquarters is in Mokpo, with two other branches, one in Seoul for design and public relations, and another in Yeoju for production. In 1953, the company was the first in Korea to develop coffee cup sets. In 1963, they began trade in Hong Kong, with exports to China growing to more than 2 million dollars in 2008. In 2011, its president signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Environment of South Korea to develop a less pollutant-emitting process. The project also includes a publicity campaign to raise public awareness on environmental issues and their effect on rare species.

=== Farming and fishing ===
Mokpo is made up of sparsely populated farmland, with 1,326 households under a half hectare. The area produces high quantities of rice, barley, and beans, with greens and fruits such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and oriental melons increasing in popularity since 2001.

Ships from the harbor often travel to Heuksando to fish for skate and hairtail. Mokpo&#x27;s yield of marine products reached 26,862 tons in 2006, consisting chiefly of fish, with of shellfish, mollusks, and seaweeds also contributing to the total. Mokpo is known for its harvest of small octopus, although this has declined in recent years. The number of fishermen had dropped to fewer than 3,000, but has been rising since 2007.

=== Industries ===
The regional economy relies heavily on the Daebul industrial complex and Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries located near Yeongam. The imports of merchandise support the local economy of Mokpo as they pass through its harbor. The Halla group was the initial owners of Heavy Industries, until they were taken over by Hyundai, which changed the company name to Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries, with Samho meaning three lakes. By 2007, corporate profits amounted to more than 460 million, an increase of about 25% over those from 2006. South Jeolla province succeeded in attracting a series of investors for renewable energy companies like solar panels. Innovation Silicon Ltd, invested 10bn won in developing a silicon producing complex.

== Geography ==

Mokpo sits at the southern end of the Muan peninsula, although the city lies within Sinan county, which mostly consists of 1004 islands. Its neighbor, Muan county, extends northeastward, separated from Mokpo by the Yeongsan river. Yudal mountain (228m) sits at the center of old downtown, and is a source of pride within the city. Its nickname is Gaegol (), meaning weird-shaped rocks and peaks. The side of the mountain caused roads around the downtown area to have a hilly aspect. Nojeokbong is a historic site where General Yi Soon Shin made use of its shape during the Japanese invasion. The city has small mountains nearby: Mt. Ibam (121m) to the east, and Yangeul (156m) and Daebak (156m) to the north. The mouth of the Yeongsan River flows along the southern side of the city, containing 13 islands. The existence of a natural seawall created a natural safe harbor.

Most of the area of Mokpo consists of land reclamation, including Samhakdo, North harbor (), and the new city of Hadang. According to the research by Mokpo National University, tributaries of the Yeongsan river crossed the central area of old downtown. This can be seen in the historic names of the Mokone Dong area: Namgyo-dong (southern side of bridge) and Bukgyo-dong (Northern side of bridge). Both names contained &quot;gyo&quot; (), meaning the bridge, indicating a bridge used to link the areas. Tideland reclamation projects removed large amounts of mud flats, including Daebandong, Baekryundong and the coastal shore around Gatbawi. Additionally, the municipal boundaries include 7 desert islands.

The wall at the end of the Yeongsan river prevented damage from flooding during harsh typhoons. Meanwhile, the water quality of the river has worsened to the point where the ministry in charge of environmental protection began studying the impacts made by man-made structures. In 2010, the ministry&#x27;s report recommended that the seawall should be widened and that the dirty water be pumped out of the riverbeds into the harbor.

Mokpo&#x27;s weather station was built along with five other sites in Korea, and began observing weather conditions on 25 March 1904. Mokpo&#x27;s climate features a short spring and autumn, and it is cold and dry in the winter and warm and humid with seasonal winds in the summer. There is also significant rain in the summer, averaging . Mokpo is usually windy and foggy in the spring and autumn due to its location near the ocean. Mokpo&#x27;s long period (annual average of 223 days) without frost creates suitable conditions for rice farming. However, its seacoast location and the influence of the continental climate on the city often cause a great disparity between the rise and fall of daily and yearly temperatures. Mokpo, along with the rest of Sinan County, has the highest level of sunlight in Korea, enabling more efficient use of solar energy plants and related energy sources. The frequency of yellow dust is quite similar to that of other cities like Seoul and Incheon, occurring about 10–11 days per year.

The climate of Mokpo is a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;). Unexpected blizzards can sweep the region with strong gusts during winter, and the city experiences more than 30 days of snow, and 60 days below . Mokpo sometimes falls within the range of passing typhoons, and may suffer peripheral damage, including heavy precipitation during the summer and early autumn. In 2004, Typhoon Mindulle gave Mokpo a record rainfall of per hour.

== Transportation ==

=== Railroad ===

Mokpo station opened 15 May 1913, it is the final destination of Honam Line and accommodates over 1.2 million annually, as well as cargo shipments.

The station is located near the mountain Yudalsan, in the southwestern part of the city. The railroad ends inside the station, although a freight-only line continued on to Samhakdo, carrying coal for the industrial factories. Because of potential danger, the city removed the rail extension in 2011.

On 1 April 2004, Korea Train Express advertised a three-hour travel time from Seoul to Mokpo, however, the actual time was longer due to the number of stops along the Honam Line. Three-hour travel was only possible when limiting the train to four stops: Seodaejeon, Iksan, Gwangjusongjeong, and finally Mokpo. However, that service has not been available since 2008. Then, there were 10 trains from Yongsan station to Mokpo, with a travel time of 195 minutes.

Since 2015, there has been a high-speed KTX service linking Mokpo and Yongsan Station within an average of 140 minutes. Limited services also allow passengers to travel further north to Seoul Station and Haengsin station in the city of Goyang.

=== Inland road ===

The Seohaean Expressway connects Mokpo to Seoul via a 4-hour car ride. The Muan-Gwangju Expressway was opened in 2008 to ease access to the Muan International Airport. In 2012, the Mokpo to Gwangyang Highway opened, connecting the eastern and western ends of South Jeolla Province, as well as continuing on to Busan.

National Route 1 was planned to connect Mokpo to Sineuju in North Korea. After the Korean War, however, the route was cut off at Imjingak near the truce village of Panmunjeom. It was not until 2000 when Route 1 was extended to North Korea&#x27;s second largest city, Gaesung.

=== Bus ===
Two companies provide most of the bus service in the local area. Since 2005, the companies and the city council agreed to expand the number of buses fueled by natural gas (NG), following a 3-year negotiation. The city agreed to assist the companies with a 21,000 US dollar per bus subsidy for each bus equipped with the NG equipment. As of 2006, 32 buses had been retrofitted with the natural gas equipment. The growing suburbs around the city created a demand for additional lines, but there is conflict between the needs of the city and the profit margin of those new lines.

Riders may transfer between buses, free of charge, beginning on 1 March 2007. The lines are classified as inner circle, outer line and artery, which follows the commuting system of Seoul Buses. Buses with a low-floor level were first deployed in South Jeolla province in 2007, although they still remain in limited service.

Since 2008, a semi-public bus system has been explored, with the intent of expanding the role of the city government in determining bus routes. The core goal is to share responsibility for operations as well as control over spending and income. However, NGOs have withheld support for the idea, resulting in the policy having not been implemented.

=== Airport ===
Muan International Airport is the airport serving Mokpo. Previously, Mokpo Airport, in Yeongam County, operated as the region&#x27;s airport. The crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 733 in 1993 increased concerns about the airport, resulting in extending the runway by 100 meters. However, the site still had fundamental drawbacks due to common foggy weather and the lack of related facilities. Korean Air abolished the Gimpo-Mokpo route and Asiana Airlines started to slash services in 2004 with the removal of the Mokpo-Jeju route. The airline companies announced deficits due to the high-speed railroad.

The alternative to Mokpo Airport was Muan International Airport, whose construction was delayed for many years, leading to disappointment among the local people. Eventually, however, the airport was constructed, and Mokpo Airport closed its doors in November 9, 2007.

=== Sea ===

Mokpo has three harbors: one each for ferry service, trading and fishing. The main harbor is used to ferry customers and cargoes around nearby islands, while North harbor conducts ferry service to Nonghyup. Additionally, the newly built harbor is used for container shipping to China.

Over 80 sea-going lines have been available, notably for Heuksando, Hongdo and Jeju, as well as ferries linking Sinan county. In 2002, the first cruise-line to Shanghai was opened for operation, however, bankruptcy concerns forced the discontinuance of the cruise line after only five months. In July 2004, another attempt to start a cruise route to Shanghai, with a newly designed, smaller boat, failed due to Chinese objections.

The Mokpo coastal terminal was originally built during the 1980s, with the government beginning an update in 2003. The 30bn won, 4-story terminal opened in February 2007. Mokpo coastal terminal is currently configured to divide coastal from international travel.

The newly built harbor in Mokpo has seen a growing number of cargoes since it opened in 2004. The harbor set a record for civil investment in a seaport in South Korea. Currently, sea routes have been established for China, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia with municipal support. In January 2011, Samsung electronics decided to choose Mokpo as their chief exporting harbor for merchandise from its factory in Gwangju.

== Culture ==


=== Festivals ===
A flower festival is held at Yudal mountain every April and May. The festival of Largehead Hairtail () takes place around Yeongsan Lake every October. The festival is extremely popular among fishing fans and family tourists. A fishing contest is held, wherein great numbers of people take part, which is followed by a fireworks display.

The Nanyeong Singing Memorial celebrates the famous singer, Lee Nan-young, whose song, &quot;Tears of Mokpo&quot; gained wide popularity. The memorial was started in 1968 by the Honam Maeil newspaper but was stopped, but was restarted by MBC Mokpo and is held every autumn.

=== City of Light ===
The city has a plan for promoting tourism in the old downtown, and South Jeolla province agreed to offer support for the city&#x27;s plan. This city&#x27;s population decline has resulted in the closure of many shops, as well as a drastic reduction in the city&#x27;s school system. For example, student enrollment at Sanjeong Elementary School has dropped to below 300 from a high of more than 3,000. The project, entitled, &quot;A City of Light&quot;, called for establishing a light show along the street which runs next to the railway station. However, environmentalists have lodged objections, arguing that the plan will have an irrevocable impact, harming the ecological balance of the mountain.

In the new downtown area, there is now a fountain, which times its waters and light show to the beat of the song. This was to be expanded, but has confronted opposition from several civil groups since 2009.

=== Islands offshore ===
Outside of the harbor, thousands of islands dot the Yellow Sea, several of which are actually part of Mokpo. The government has promoted a program of constructing infrastructure on each island. With the slogan of &quot;Lovely island, Uai-dal&quot;, Hanok residences on these islands, each with a saltwater pool, have served as accommodations for tourists during the summer.

One of the most famous islands, Goha-do, was used as a base for naval forces in the late 16th century when Japan invaded Joseon. The Japanese navy created artificial caves on this island to conceal armaments from the Allies during the Second World War. Two air-raid shelters have been found. The Mokpo Bridge was publicly opened in June 2012.

=== Museums ===
Many museums in Mokpo are located near Gatbawi street, due to the city concentrating its investment to exhibition space in this area. The National Maritime museum is one of the oldest museums dedicated to the Korean naval and shipping traditions. The museum changed its name in 2009 to the Research Institute for Maritime History, due to its broadened function. The Institute conducts surveys and research related to ancient ships, trade routes and relics, and is the only research institute for maritime relics in South Korea.

The Mokpo Natural History Museum has a large collection of fossils from all over the world. It originally began as a single building, but has expanded into a second building, the Cultural Heritage Hall, which specializes in local relics dating as far back as prehistoric time. The museum has an extensive collection of samples and data regarding everything from dinosaur fossils to insects and cetaceans found in the Yellow Sea. One of the most significant displays is a nest of dinosaur eggs, found on Aphae island, which was restored and opened to the public in 2010. The eggs reach lengths greater than 40 cm, and have been dated to approximately 80 million years ago, during the Mesozoic period. The Korea Forest Service chose the museum to record its samples of insects in a national database for biological resources in 2009.

Namnong Memorial Hall commemorates the famed calligrapher, Heo Gun. The Hall is situated within a Korean traditional garden and features exhibitions on different series of his works.

The Mokpo Ceramic Museum opened in 2008, was funded by the government to establish ceramics and china exhibits from notable manufacturers. Meanwhile, the Literature hall of Mokpo () is not far from the ceramic museum, and hosts literature classes for the general public, featuring specific writers or novels, to promote literature among the local population.

===Cuisine===

Being located close to the sea, the city&#x27;s cuisine is characterized by seafood dishes. Mokpo is famous for hongeo-hoe (), a strong smelling fermented dish featuring the skate, a kind of ray fish.
Other delicacies of Mokpo are: kimchi and pyeonyuk (); a variant of yeonpo-tang containing long arm octopus; hoe; and seasoned &quot;Portunus trituberculatus&quot;. The city started a public market for vendors selling their own delicacies, located downtown.


=== Facilities for sports and cultural entertainment ===
Yudal Stadium is located next to the 100 Year Memorial Avenue. The stadium consists of ballpark and an eight lane track. Behind the stadium, local groups are able to use public tennis courts. The ground floor of the stadium houses committees of diverse sports.

The city has attracted many athletes to train in the area during the winter, due to sunny and warm weather, and numerous accommodations. The city has been very successful in reaching agreements with 127 teams, totaling almost 6,000 athletes, who trained during the winter in 2004. Since 2005, the focus has been on track and field sports to boost the number of visiting athletes.

Recreational parks are located sparsely around Yudal mountain, while the city is in the process of constructing an additional park in the Samhakdo area.

The Mokpo Cultural Complex is located along the shore near Gatbawi, consisting of two buildings, one for performance and the other for exhibition. However, the complex is limited by its seating capacity: a maximum of 700 people for the two-story building.

The Mokpo Civil Culture &amp; Sports Center was built in 2003 to meet the needs of the increasing population in the downtown area. However, the operating fees have proven a burden to the province. It consists of three halls, with a capacity of more than 1,200 people.

There are two libraries in Mokpo. The Civil Library of Mokpo opened in 1974 at the old consulate of Japan. In 1989, it moved closer to Yudal stadium, and consists of 4 stories, with 1,636 seats. The library is home to over 360,000 books, as well as having internet-access research rooms. The Public Library of Mokpo is located near North Harbor. It began as part of the Mokpo Educational Institute, but has since gained independence.

===Tourism===

Gatbawi is a natural Sandstone and Tafoni formation found on the shore of Mokpo&#x27;s east harbor, near the mouth of the Yeongsan River.

== Media ==
Branch offices of KBS and MBC exist in Mokpo. KBS Mokpo was established in 1942, at a location close to the Yeon dong area, prior to its move next to the current city hall in Yongdang. MBC Mokpo was initially planned as a radio station when it opened in 1967, using a frequency of 1386 kHz.

FEBC Mokpo opened an office in 1999, for Christian missions around the Honam area. For cable broadcasting, Honam Hanguk cable has its office in Hadang.

South of Mokpo at 34.679364 N 126.445148 E, there is a VLF-transmitter with two very tall masts ( height unknown).

As of 2008, the number of doctors per capita was 11.41 per thousand, increasing from 10.45 of the prior year. The council of doctors in Mokpo has stated that the ongoing economic improvement, as well as the growing populations, will cause the need for the construction of middle-sized or larger hospitals and clinics.

Mokpo National hospital was established in 1962, specifically for the treatment of tuberculosis. Originally a city hospital, the state took over operations in 2002.

The ministry of Health chose Mokpo and Incheon as a sites for operating medical helicopters. Hankook hospital was officially designated the location for these emergency services.

<text>Pohang (; ), formerly spelled Po-Hang, is the largest city in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, with a population of 499,363 as of 2022, bordering the East Sea to the east, Yeongcheon to the west, Gyeongju to the south, and Cheongsong and Yeongdeok to the north.

The city has food, textile, and metal industries. Agricultural products such as grapes, persimmons and garlic chives are abundant, and the city&#x27;s proximity to the East Sea has led to the development of a fishing industry. Hagfish is a local specialty.

The Korean Marine Corps 1st Division is stationed in Pohang, and their Education and Training Command is located there as well.

Tourist attractions include the Jukdo Fish Market, where fresh seafood is sold, as well as the Yeongildae Beach, Wolpo Beach, and Pohang Songdo Beach. Naejangsan Mountain divides Pohang and Yeongdeok and has twelve waterfalls.

==History==

The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Pohang area is from the Mumun Pottery Period (1500–300 BC). Archaeologists have unearthed small villages and megalithic burials (dolmen) from this period. Still a small fishing village at the dawn of the 20th century, the earliest steps toward developing Pohang into a place of greater significance were taken in 1930 with the construction of a modern harbour. Pohang grew rapidly afterward, attaining the designation of town (&quot;eup&quot;) in 1931 and then earning the status of city (&quot;si&quot;) in 1949.

Pohang&#x27;s road arteries and shipping port made it a place of strategic significance during the Korean War. An unopposed landing of UN forces at Pohang on July 18, 1950 was the first large-scale amphibious operation since World War II, and the region around Pohang saw fierce clashes between South Korea&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division and North Korea&#x27;s 5th Infantry Division during August–September 1950.

By the 1960s, Pohang was a small coastal city with a population of 50,000. The next major development in Pohang&#x27;s growth came in 1968 with the inauguration of the steel maker POSCO, and the local plant&#x27;s commencement of production in 1972. The introduction of heavy industry to the city brought the local economy to a blend of iron, steel, shipbuilding and fisheries through the end of the 20th century.

The early 21st century and the age of globalization has brought new economic challenges to companies such as POSCO, giving rise to beliefs that Pohang would be wise to not be overly reliant on heavy industry to maintain its prosperity. In response, the Pohang of today presents itself as having an eye to the future, striving to become a diversified city of environmentalism and advanced learning, as well as a centre of arts and culture.

During the Silla Dynasty the area was made up of four &quot;hyeon&quot;, Toehwa-hyeon (), Jidap-hyeon (), Geunoji-hyeon (), Haea-hyeon (). Then during the Goryeo Dynasty these four were renamed to Heunghae-gun (흥해군/), Janggi-hyeon (), Yeongil-hyeon (), Cheongha-hyeon () respectively.

On 4 August 1896, the three remaining &quot;hyeon&quot;, which at that time were Janggi, Yeonil (; originally Yeongil) and Cheongha were reassigned as counties or &quot;gun&quot; as part of the change to the 13-province division of the Korean Empire.

On 1 March 1914, the four counties were unified as one Yeongil-gun (), which was subdivided into 18 &quot;myeons&quot;.

On 1 April 1931, Pohang-myeon () was designated as an &quot;eup&quot;, thus giving Yeongil-gun 1 eup and 17 myeon.

On 1 April 1934, Jukbuk-myeon () and Juknam-myeon () were united to make Jukjang-myeon (), while Janggi-myeon () and Bongsan-myeon () united to make Jihaeng-myeon (), so that there were 1 eup and 15 myeon.

On 1 October 1938, Hyeongsan-myeon () was incorporated into Pohang-eup, leaving Yeongil-gun with 1 eup and 14 myeon.

On 1 October 1942 Changju-myeon () was renamed and reclassified as Guryongpo-eup (구룡포읍/九龍浦邑), leaving 2 eup and 13 myeon.

On 15 August 1949, Pohang-eup was designated as Pohang-&quot;si&quot; (), leaving Yeongil with 1 si, 1 eup, 13 myeon and 1 local office.

On 8 July 1956, Heunghae-myeon () and Gokgang-myeon () are incorporated into Uichang-myeon () leaving 1 si, 1 eup and 12 myeon.

On 29 October 1957, Daljeon-myeon () is abolished and incorporated into Heunghae-myeon and Yeonil-myeon () leaving 1 si, 1 eup and 11 myeons.

On 1 March 1967, the Gibuk Local Office () of Gigye-myeon (기계면/) is established.

On 1 July 1973, Uichang-myeon is designated as Uichang-eup () leaving 1 si, 2 eup, 10 myeon and 3 local offices.

On 1 December 1980, Yeonil-myeon and Ocheon-myeon () are both designated as eup leaving 1 si, 4 eup, 8 myeon and 3 local offices.

On 1 September 1982, Haedo-dong () and Sangdae-dong () are separated into Haedo 1 and 2-dong and Sangdae 1 and 2-dong respectively.

On 1 April 1986, Daebo Local Office () and Gibuk Local Office are designated as myeon leaving 1 si, 4 eup, 10 myeon and 1 local office.

On 1 January 1995, a united Pohang absorbs all of Yeongil-gun, composed of 1 si, 2 gu, 4 eup, 10 myeon, 25 dong and 1 local office.

On 1 September 1998, the unification of Small-dong left Pohang with 1 si, 2 gu, 4 eup, 10 myeon, 19 dong and 1 local office.

On 1 January 2009, the unification of Small-dong left Pohang with 1 si, 2 gu, 4 eup, 10 myeon, 15 dong and 1 local office.

==Transportation==
The city is served by several trains a day from Seoul and Daegu. Pohang is the terminus for a number of ferry routes serving the adjacent Sea of Japan, including the main tourist route for Ulleung Island and Liancourt Rocks. 
Pohang is the home of POSCO (the Pohang Steel Company), one of the largest steel producers in the world, and a host of related industries. As a result, the port shipped a total of 54.8 million tons in 2006.

Several flights per day to Seoul Gimpo Airport and Jeju Airport are available at Pohang Gyeongju Airport.

Local transportation is served by only city buses. They run about 20 different ways of the city and some of them reach to the mountain folk. Also, the buses are classified into 2 kinds – one is Ilban-bus (normal bus) and the other is Jwaseok-bus (full of seats and a little more expensive than Ilban-bus). They run 15~25 minutes intervals along their own way. The bus routes are listed in both Korean and English but the Korean version is interactive, and thus more helpful.

There are two main bus terminals - Shiwae () and Gosok () which roughly translate into intercity/city and express. The Shiwae bus terminal () also acts as the cross-country bus terminal from which access to nearby metropolitan cities such as Daegu and Busan (~1.5 hrs each depending on traffic) is available. Their website is only in Korean and only accessible in Internet Explorer. The Gosok bus terminal () website is in both English and Korean. From Gosok bus terminal one can travel to Seoul and Gwangju.

Pohang is also serviced by two train stations - Pohang station () and Wolpo station (). Times and destinations are available on the Korail website which is in English and Korean.

Passengers using the KTX had to go to Gyeongju station () until 2015. However, since 2015, the KTX travels directly to Pohang station ().

<doc id="326508" wikidata="Q76735" url="?curid=326508" title="Karl Richter (conductor)">
<text>Karl Richter (15 October 1926 – 15 February 1981) was a German conductor, choirmaster, organist, and harpsichordist.

==Early life and education==
Karl Richter was born in Plauen to Christian Johannes Richter, a Protestant pastor, and Clara Hedwig Richter. He studied first in Dresden, where he was a member of the Dresdner Kreuzchor and later in Leipzig, where he received his degree in 1949. He studied with Günther Ramin (former teacher of another prominent Bach specialist, organist Helmut Walcha), Karl Straube and Rudolf Mauersberger.

==Career==
In 1949, the year of his graduation, Richter became organist at St. Thomas Church, Leipzig, where Johann Sebastian Bach had been the music director for 27 years. During his tenure there, he was witness to the inauguration of Bach&#x27;s new grave and prepared a special performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. Anne&quot; Prelude and Fugue in E-flat for the reception.

In 1952, after marrying Gladys Müller, with whom he had two children, Tobias and Simone, he moved to Munich, where he taught organ at the University of Music and Performing Arts Munich and was cantor and organist at St. Mark&#x27;s Church.

In 1954, Richter founded the Münchener Bach-Chor (Munich Bach Choir), and soon after, the Münchener Bach-Orchester (Munich Bach Orchestra), which rapidly became established as a prominent international ensemble and noted for its interpretations of the works of J. S. Bach and other composers. In the 1960s and 1970s he recorded often and toured Japan, the United States, Canada, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Richter served as conductor of both ensembles from 1954 until 1981. In 1977, a recording of the First Movement from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F&quot; by the Munich Bach Orchestra under Richter was selected by NASA to be included on the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated copper record that was sent into space on the Voyager space craft. The record contained sounds and images which had been selected as examples of the diversity of life and culture on Earth.

Richter played and conducted a wide range of music (sacred works from Heinrich Schütz to Max Reger, as well as the symphonic and concerto repertoire of the Classical and Romantic periods – even including Bruckner symphonies), but is best remembered for his interpretations of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. Richter&#x27;s performances were known for their soul-searching, intense and festive manner. He avoided the fluctuations in tempo that were previously characteristic of the prevailing Romantic manner of interpreting Bach, and devoted much attention to the woodwinds and to balance in general. His recordings from 1958 to 1970 are notable for &quot;discipline, rhythmic tautness and expressive intensity&quot;.

Richter viewed Baroque music as fundamentally impromptu and subjective in nature, explaining in an interview that he had been told his performance of Bach&#x27;s St. Matthew Passion sounded different from the one he had performed last year. He viewed this observation in a positive light, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s bad if you play a work with disdainful routine because you have to, and if you no longer have any thoughts or ideas about it.&quot; This was one of Richter&#x27;s strengths, because each concert he conducted was a unique, irreplaceable event, and even though two performances could sound slightly different, both seemed just right in the moment he was playing them. Musicians who played with him acknowledged this and analogized that performing Baroque music with Richter was like playing ping-pong because the back and forth is what directed the piece.

As well as a conductor, Richter is also renowned as a virtuoso harpsichordist and organist. He undertook at least two American concert tours, the second in late 1958. His performances of Bach&#x27;s organ works are known for their imposing registrations and favorable pace and are regarded by many as definitive.

==Later years and death==

In 1971, Richter suffered a heart attack and thereafter suffered increasing problems with his vision. Consequently, he began to memorize as many works as he could before he might lose his sight. Eventually he had eye surgery, of which he was initially skeptical but which was effective.

When asked about the energy-draining self-imposed burden of work he set himself, he would reply &quot;My time is now&quot; and &quot;We Richters don&#x27;t grow old.&quot;

In a hotel in Munich in 1981 he suffered a fatal heart attack, and was buried in the Enzenbühl cemetery in Zürich eight days later. His widow Gladys, who was born in 1931, died in 2019 and was buried in his grave. 

== Selected works ==
Although focusing mainly on the German Baroque period – and particularly on Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s works, Richter recorded a wide amount of music. His discography includes works by Scarlatti, Handel, Telemann, C. P. E. Bach and Joh. Chr. Bach (Johann Sebastian&#x27;s sons), Haydn, Gluck, Mozart and Mendelssohn, and Beethoven&#x27;s Mass in C major. He also recorded organ works by Liszt and Reger related to Bach, and Brahms&#x27; chorale preludes for organ.

<text>Sir Harold Malcolm Watts Sargent (29 April 1895 – 3 October 1967) was an English conductor, organist and composer widely regarded as Britain&#x27;s leading conductor of choral works. The musical ensembles with which he was associated included the Ballets Russes, the Huddersfield Choral Society, the Royal Choral Society, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, and the London Philharmonic, Hallé, Liverpool Philharmonic, BBC Symphony and Royal Philharmonic orchestras. Sargent was held in high esteem by choirs and instrumental soloists, but because of his high standards and a statement that he made in a 1936 interview disputing musicians&#x27; rights to tenure, his relationship with orchestral players was often uneasy. Despite this, he was co-founder of the London Philharmonic, was the first conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic as a full-time ensemble, and played an important part in saving the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from disbandment in the 1960s.

As chief conductor of London&#x27;s internationally famous summer music festival the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts (&quot;the Proms&quot;) from 1947 to 1967, Sargent was one of the best-known English conductors. When he took over the Proms, he and two assistants conducted the two-month season between them. By the time he died, he was assisted by a large international roster of guest conductors.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Sargent turned down an offer of a musical directorship in Australia and returned to Britain to bring music to as many people as possible as his contribution to national morale. His fame extended beyond the concert hall: to the British public, he was a familiar broadcaster in BBC radio discussion programmes, and generations of Gilbert and Sullivan devotees have known his recordings of the most popular Savoy Operas. He toured widely throughout the world and was noted for his skill as a conductor, his championship of British composers, and his debonair appearance, which won him the nickname &quot;Flash Harry&quot;.

==Life and career==
Sargent&#x27;s parents lived in Stamford, Lincolnshire, but he was born in Ashford, in Kent while his mother was staying with a family friend. He was the elder child and only son of Henry Edward Sargent (1863–1936) and his wife Agnes, &quot;née&quot; Hall (1860–1942). Henry Sargent was chief clerk at a Stamford coal merchant, an amateur musician and local church organist; before their marriage his wife had been the matron of the Stamford High School for Girls. The young Sargent won a scholarship to Stamford School, where he was a pupil from 1907 to 1912. At the same time he was preparing for the musical career his father envisaged for him. He studied piano and organ, and joined the local amateur operatic society, making his stage debut in &quot;The Mikado&quot; aged 13 and conducting for the first time the following year when the regular conductor was unavailable. On leaving school, Sargent was articled to Haydn Keeton, organist of Peterborough Cathedral, and was one of the last musicians to be trained in that traditional way. At the age of 16 he gained his diploma as Associate of the Royal College of Organists, and at 18 he was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Music by the University of Durham.

===Early career===

Sargent worked first as an organist at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, from 1914 to 1924, except for eight months in 1918 when he served as a private in the Durham Light Infantry during the First World War. He was chosen for the organist post over more than 150 other applicants. In addition to his organ playing he worked on many musical projects in Leicester, Melton Mowbray and Stamford, where he not only conducted but also produced the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan and others for amateur societies. The Prince of Wales and his entourage often hunted in Leicestershire and watched the annual Gilbert and Sullivan productions there, together with the Duke of York and other members of the Royal Family. At the age of 24 Sargent became England&#x27;s youngest Doctor of Music, with a degree from Durham.

Sargent&#x27;s break came when Sir Henry Wood visited the De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen&#x27;s Hall orchestra. As it was his custom to commission a piece from a local composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece. Sargent did so – a tone poem, &quot;An Impression on a Windy Day&quot;, a seven-minute orchestral &quot;allegro impetuoso&quot;. He completed it too late for Wood to have enough time to learn it, and Wood called on him to conduct the first performance. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent&#x27;s talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his London debut, conducting the work at the Proms – the annual season of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts – in the Queen&#x27;s Hall on 11 October of the same year.

Sargent as composer attracted favourable notice in a Prom season when other composer-conductors included Gustav Holst with his &quot;Planets&quot; suite, and the next year Wood included Sargent&#x27;s &quot;Nocturne and Scherzo&quot; in the Proms programme, also conducted by the composer. Sargent was invited to conduct his &quot;Impression&quot; again in the 1923 season, but it was as a conductor that he made the greater impact. On the advice of Wood, among others, he soon abandoned composition in favour of conducting. He founded the amateur Leicester Symphony Orchestra in 1922, which he continued to conduct until 1939. Under Sargent, the orchestra&#x27;s prestige grew until it was able to obtain such top-flight soloists as Alfred Cortot, Artur Schnabel, Solomon, Guilhermina Suggia and Benno Moiseiwitsch. Moiseiwitsch gave Sargent piano lessons without charge, judging him talented enough to make a successful career as a concert pianist, but Sargent chose a conducting career. At the instigation of Wood and Adrian Boult he became a lecturer at the Royal College of Music in London in 1923.

===National fame===

In the 1920s Sargent became one of the best-known English conductors. In London, he succeeded Boult as conductor of the Robert Mayer Concerts for Children from 1924 to 1939. In the provinces he conducted the British National Opera Company in &quot;The Mastersingers&quot; on tour in 1924 and 1925, winning praise from music critics around the country. In 1925 he conducted his first broadcast performance for the BBC: more than two thousand more followed over the next four decades.

In 1926 Sargent began an association with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company that lasted, on and off, for the rest of his life. He conducted London seasons at the Prince&#x27;s Theatre in 1926 and the newly rebuilt Savoy Theatre in 1929–30. He was criticised by &quot;The Times&quot; for allegedly adding &quot;gags&quot; to the Gilbert and Sullivan scores, although the writer praised the crispness of the ensemble, the &quot;musicalness&quot; of the performance and the beauty of the overture. Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte wrote to the paper stating that Sargent had worked from Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s manuscript scores and had merely brought out the &quot;details of the orchestration&quot; exactly as Sullivan had written them. Some of the principal cast members objected to Sargent&#x27;s fast tempi, at least at first. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte seasons brought Sargent&#x27;s name to a wider public with an early BBC radio relay of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in 1926 heard by up to eight million people. &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; commented that this was &quot;probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one time in the history of the world&quot;.

In 1927 Sergei Diaghilev engaged Sargent to conduct for the Ballets Russes, sharing the conducting with Igor Stravinsky and Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1928 Sargent was appointed conductor of the Royal Choral Society; he retained this post for four decades until his death. The society was famous in the 1920s and 1930s for staged performances of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall, a work with which Sargent&#x27;s name soon became synonymous.
Elizabeth Courtauld, wife of the industrialist and art collector Samuel Courtauld, promoted a popular series of subscription concerts beginning in 1929 and on Schnabel&#x27;s advice engaged Sargent as chief conductor, with guest conductors including Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer and Stravinsky. The Courtauld-Sargent concerts, as they became known, were aimed at people who had not previously attended concerts. They attracted large audiences, bringing Sargent&#x27;s name before another section of the public. In addition to the core repertory, Sargent introduced new works by Bliss, Honegger, Kodály, Martinů, Prokofiev, Szymanowski and Walton, among others. At first, the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged for these concerts, but the orchestra, a self-governing co-operative, refused to replace key players whom Sargent considered sub-standard. As a result, in conjunction with Beecham, Sargent set about establishing a new orchestra, the London Philharmonic.

In these years Sargent tackled a wide repertoire, recording much of it, but he was particularly noted for performances of choral pieces, most notably Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, performed with large choruses and orchestras. He joked that his career was based on &quot;the two M&#x27;s – &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Mikado&quot;&quot;. He promoted British music, as he would throughout his career, and conducted the premieres of &quot;At the Boar&#x27;s Head&quot; (1925) by Holst; &quot;Hugh the Drover&quot; (1924); &quot;Sir John in Love&quot; (1929) by Vaughan Williams; and Walton&#x27;s cantata &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; (at the Leeds Triennial Festival of 1931). The chorus for the last of these found Walton&#x27;s music difficult, but Sargent engaged them with it, telling them they were helping to make musical history, and reminding them that Berlioz&#x27;s Requiem and Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; had been considered impossible at first. He drew from them and the LSO what &quot;The Times&quot; described as &quot;a performance of unflagging energy and amazing volume of tone under Dr. Malcolm Sargent&quot;.

===Difficult years and war years===

In October 1932 Sargent suffered a near-fatal attack of tuberculosis. For almost two years he was unable to work, and it was only later in the 1930s that he returned to the concert scene. In 1936 he conducted his first opera at Covent Garden, Gustave Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Louise&quot;. He did not conduct opera there again until 1954, with Walton&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, although he did conduct the incidental music for a dramatisation of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; given at the Royal Opera House in 1948.

Although Sargent was popular with choral singers, his relations with orchestras were sometimes strained. After giving a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; interview in 1936 in which he said that an orchestral musician did not deserve a &quot;job for life&quot; and should &quot;give of his lifeblood with every bar he plays,&quot; Sargent lost much favour with orchestral musicians. They were particularly aggrieved because of their support of him during his long illness, and thereafter he faced frequent hostility from British orchestras.
Being popular in Australia with players as well as the public, Sargent made three lengthy tours of Australia and New Zealand, beginning in 1936. He was on the point of accepting a permanent appointment with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he felt it his duty to return to his country, resisting strong pressure from the Australian media for him to stay. During the war, Sargent directed the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939–1942) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942–1948) and became a popular BBC Home Service radio broadcaster, particularly in the discussion programme &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;. He helped boost public morale during the war by extensive concert tours around the country conducting for nominal fees. On one occasion, an air raid interrupted a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7. Sargent stopped the orchestra, reassured the audience that they were safer inside the hall than fleeing outside, and resumed conducting. He later said that no orchestra had ever played so well and that no audience in his experience had ever listened so intently. In May 1941 he conducted the last performance heard in the Queen&#x27;s Hall. Following an afternoon concert comprising the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; and &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; – praised by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;performances of real distinction&quot; – the hall was destroyed during an overnight incendiary raid.

In 1945 Arturo Toscanini invited Sargent to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. In four concerts Sargent chose to present all English music, with the exception of Sibelius&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 and Dvořák&#x27;s Symphony No. 7. Two concertos, Walton&#x27;s Viola Concerto with William Primrose, and Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto with Yehudi Menuhin, were programmed as part of these concerts. Menuhin judged Sargent&#x27;s conducting of the latter &quot;the next best to Elgar in this work&quot;.

===The Proms===
Sargent was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1947 Birthday Honours for services to music. He performed in numerous English-speaking countries during the post-war years and continued to promote British composers, conducting the premieres of Walton&#x27;s opera, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1954), and Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 (1958).

Sargent was a dominant figure at the Proms in the post-war era. He was chief conductor of the Proms from 1947 until his death in 1967, taking part in 514 concerts. A 1947 Prom under his baton was the first concert to be televised in Britain. As conductor of the Proms, Sargent gained his widest fame, making the &quot;Last Night&quot; of each season into a high-ratings broadcast celebration aimed at ordinary audiences, a popular, theatrical flag-waving extravaganza presided over by himself. He was noted for his witty addresses in which he good-naturedly chided the noisy promenaders. In his programmes he often conducted choral music and music by British composers, but his range was broad: the BBC&#x27;s official history of the Proms lists selected programmes from this period showing Sargent conducting works by Bach, Sibelius, Dvořák, Berlioz, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov, Richard Strauss and Kodály in three successive programmes. During his chief conductorship, prestigious foreign conductors and orchestras began to perform regularly at the Proms. In his first season in charge, Sargent and two assistant conductors conducted all the concerts among them; by 1966 there were Sargent and 25 other conductors. Those making their Prom debuts in the Sargent years included Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Rudolf Kempe, Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink.

Sargent was chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1950 to 1957, succeeding Boult. He was not the BBC&#x27;s first choice, but John Barbirolli and Rafael Kubelik turned the post down, and it went to Sargent, despite reservations about his commitment. Unlike Boult he refused to join the staff of the BBC and remained a freelance, accepting other engagements as he pleased. The historian of the BBC Asa Briggs has written, &quot;Sargent sometimes ruffled the orchestra in a way that Boult had never done. Indeed there were many people inside the BBC who profoundly regretted Boult&#x27;s departure.&quot; Briggs adds that Sargent was the target of criticism from the BBC&#x27;s own Music Department for &quot;not devoting enough time to the orchestra&quot;. The music journalist Norman Lebrecht goes so far as to say that Sargent &quot;almost wrecked&quot; the BBC orchestra. The orchestra objected to his &quot;autocratic and &quot;prima-donna&quot; attitude towards orchestral players&quot; and flatly refused to accede to his demand that they all stand up when he came on to the platform. He rapidly became equally unpopular with the BBC music department, ignoring its agenda and pursuing his own. A senior BBC manager wrote:

It did not help that Sargent was universally acknowledged to be at his finest in choral music. His reputation in big works for chorus and orchestra such as &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, &quot;Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; was unrivalled, and his large-scale performances of Handel oratorios were assured packed houses. But his regular programming of such works did nothing to lift the spirits of the BBC SO: orchestral musicians regarded playing the instrumental accompaniment for large choirs as drudgery.

Although there were complaints within the BBC, there was praise from outside it for Sargent&#x27;s work with the orchestra. His biographer Reid wrote, &quot;Sargent&#x27;s liveliness and drive soon gave BBC playing a gloss and briskness which had not been conspicuous before&quot;. Another biographer, Aldous, wrote, &quot;Everywhere Sargent and the orchestra performed there were ovations, laurel wreaths and terrific reviews.&quot; The orchestra&#x27;s reputation both in Britain and internationally grew during Sargent&#x27;s tenure. Briggs records that conductor had &quot;great moments of triumph ... both at festivals overseas and during the Proms&quot;. In the 1950s and 1960s he made many recordings with the BBC Symphony, as well as other ensembles, as described below. In this period, also, he conducted the concerts that opened the Royal Festival Hall in 1951 and returned to the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company for the summer 1951 Festival of Britain season at the Savoy Theatre and the winter 1961–62 and 1963–64 seasons at the Savoy. In August 1956 the BBC announced that he would be replaced as Chief Conductor of the BBC orchestra by Rudolf Schwarz. Sargent was given the title of &quot;Chief Guest Conductor&quot; and he remained Conductor-in-Chief of the Proms.

===Overseas and last years===

Sargent made two tours of South America. In 1950 he conducted in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro and Santiago. His programmes included Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;London&quot; and 6th Symphonies; Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 88, Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 8, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter&quot; symphony, Schubert&#x27;s 5th, Brahms&#x27;s 2nd and 4th and Sibelius&#x27;s 5th symphonies, Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for Strings&quot;, Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot;, Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s Merry Pranks&quot;, Walton&#x27;s Viola Concerto and Dvořák&#x27;s Cello Concerto with Pierre Fournier. In 1952 Sargent conducted in all the above-mentioned cities and also in Lima. Half his repertory on that tour consisted of British music and included Delius, Vaughan Williams, Britten, Walton and Handel.

When the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was in danger of extinction after Beecham&#x27;s death in 1961, Sargent played a major part in saving it, doing much to win back the good opinion of orchestral players that he had lost because of his 1936 interview. In the 1960s, he toured Russia, the United States, Canada, Turkey, Israel, India, the Far East and Australia. By the mid-1960s his health began to deteriorate. His final conducting appearances were on 6 and 8 July 1967, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Ravinia Festival. On 6 July he conducted Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect Fool&quot;, Wieniawski&#x27;s Second Violin Concerto with Itzhak Perlman, and Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;A London Symphony&quot;. On 8 July he conducted Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Overture &quot;The Wasps&quot;, Delius&#x27;s &quot;The Walk to the Paradise Garden&quot;, Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4 with David Bar-Illan, and Sibelius&#x27;s Symphony No. 2.

Sargent underwent surgery in July 1967 for pancreatic cancer and made a valedictory appearance at the end of the Last Night of the Proms in September that year, handing over the baton to his successor, Colin Davis. He died two weeks later, at the age of 72. He was buried in Stamford cemetery alongside members of his family.

===Musical reputation and repertoire===
Toscanini, Beecham and many others regarded Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, &quot;He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see the eyes of a choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to understand what he means to them.&quot; Boult thought him &quot;a great all-rounder&quot;, but added, &quot;he never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn&#x27;t think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music.&quot;

Although orchestral players resented Sargent for much of his career after the 1936 interview, instrumental soloists generally liked working with him. The cellist Pierre Fournier called him a &quot;guardian angel&quot; and compared him favourably with George Szell and Herbert von Karajan. Artur Schnabel, Jascha Heifetz and Yehudi Menuhin thought similarly highly of him. Cyril Smith wrote in his autobiography, &quot;...he seems to sense what the pianist wants of the music even before he begins to play it... He has an incredible speed of mind, and it has always been a great joy, as well as a rare professional experience, to work with him.&quot; For this reason, among others, Sargent was continually in demand as a conductor for concertos.

&quot;The Times&quot; obituary said Sargent &quot;was of all British conductors in his day the most widely esteemed by the lay public... a fluent, attractive pianist, a brilliant score-reader, a skilful and effective arranger and orchestrator... as a conductor his stick technique was regarded by many as the most accomplished and reliable in the world... [H]is taste... was moulded by the Victorian cathedral tradition into which he was born.&quot; It commented that, in his later years, his interpretations of the standard classical and romantic repertoire were &quot;prepared... down to the last detail&quot; but sometimes &quot;unexuberant&quot;, though his performances of &quot;the music composed within his lifetime... remained lucid and continually compelling&quot;. The flute player Gerald Jackson wrote, &quot;I feel that [Walton] conducts his own music as well as anyone else, with the possible exception of Sargent, who of course introduced and always makes a big thing of &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;.&quot;

The composers whose works Sargent regularly conducted included, from the eighteenth century, Bach, Handel, Gluck, Mozart and Haydn; and from the nineteenth century, Beethoven, Berlioz, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Smetana, Sullivan and Dvořák. From the twentieth century, British composers in his repertoire included Bliss, Britten, Delius, Elgar (a favourite, especially Elgar&#x27;s choral works &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, &quot;The Apostles&quot; and &quot;The Kingdom&quot; and symphonies), Holst, Tippett, Vaughan Williams and Walton. With the exception of Alban Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto, Sargent avoided the works of the Second Viennese School but programmed works by Bartók, Dohnányi, Hindemith, Honegger, Kodály, Martinů, Poulenc, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Strauss, Stravinsky and Szymanowski.

==Personal life, reputation and legacy==

===Private life===
In 1923 Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne (1898–1977). She was the younger daughter of Frederick William Horne – a prosperous miller, farmer, coal merchant and carter – and the niece of Evangeline Astley Cooper of Hambleton Hall in Rutland, where she lived in the early 1920s. Sargent was a guest there in the same period, and his name occurs alongside hers in local press reports of social gatherings such as hunt balls. When they married, the press headlined her name rather than that of her still little-known husband. The couple were married at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Drinkstone, the service conducted by the bride&#x27;s uncle, who, as her grandfather had been, was rector there. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter, Pamela, who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter&#x27;s death, and his recording of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; in 1945 was an expression of his grief. The marriage was unhappy and ended in divorce in 1946. Before, during and after his marriage, Sargent was a continual womaniser, which he did not deny. Among his reported affairs were long-standing ones with Diana Bowes-Lyon, Princess Marina and Edwina Mountbatten. Less savoury encounters are alluded to by the young woman who said, &quot;Promise me that whatever happens I shan&#x27;t have to go home alone in a taxi with Malcolm Sargent.&quot;

Away from music, Sargent was elected a member of The Literary Society, a dining club founded in 1807 by William Wordsworth and others. He was also a member of the Beefsteak Club, for which his proposer was Sir Edward Elgar, the Garrick, and the long-established and aristocratic White&#x27;s and Pratt&#x27;s clubs. His public service appointments included the joint presidency of the London Union of Youth Clubs, and the presidency of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Despite Sargent&#x27;s vanities and rivalries, he had many friends. Sir Thomas Armstrong in a 1994 broadcast interview stressed that Sargent &quot;had many good generous virtues; he was kind to many people, and I loved him...&quot;. Nevertheless, even friends such as Sir Rupert Hart-Davis, secretary of the Literary Society, considered him a &quot;bounder&quot;, and the composer Dame Ethel Smyth called him a &quot;cad&quot;. Yet despite his philandering and ambition, Sargent was a deeply religious man all his life and was comforted on his deathbed by visits from the Anglican Archbishop of York, Donald Coggan and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Heenan. He also received telephone calls from Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, and had a reconciliation with his son, Peter, from whom he had been estranged.

===&quot;Flash Harry&quot;===

A number of purported explanations have been advanced for Sargent&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Flash Harry&quot;. Reid opines that it &quot;was first in circulation among orchestral players before the war and that they used it in no spirit of adulation&quot;. It may have arisen from his impeccable and stylish appearance – he always wore a red or white carnation in his buttonhole (the carnation is now the symbol of the school named for him). This was perhaps reinforced by his brisk tempi early in his career, and by a story about his racing from one recording session to another. Another explanation, that he was named after Ronald Searle&#x27;s St Trinian&#x27;s character &quot;Flash Harry&quot;, is certainly wrong: Sargent&#x27;s nickname was current long before the first appearance of the St Trinian&#x27;s character in 1954. Sargent&#x27;s devoted fans, the Promenaders, used the nickname in an approving sense, and shortened it to &quot;Flash&quot;, though Sargent was not especially fond of the sobriquet, even thus modified.

Beecham and Sargent were allies from the early days of the London Philharmonic to Beecham&#x27;s final months when they were planning joint concerts. They even happened to share the same birthday. When Sargent was incapacitated by tuberculosis in 1933, Beecham conducted a performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; at the Albert Hall to raise money to support his younger colleague. Sargent enjoyed Beecham&#x27;s company, and took in good part his quips, such as his reference to the image-conscious young conductor Herbert von Karajan as &quot;a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent&quot; and, on learning that Sargent&#x27;s car was caught in rifle fire in Palestine, &quot;I had no idea the Arabs were so musical.&quot; Beecham declared that Sargent &quot;is the greatest choirmaster we have ever produced ... he makes the buggers sing like blazes&quot;. And on another occasion he said that Sargent was &quot;the most expert of all our conductors – myself excepted of course&quot;.

===Honours and memorials===
In addition to his own doctorate from Durham, Sargent was awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of Oxford and Liverpool and by the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Organists, the Royal College of Music and the Swedish Academy of Music. He was awarded the highest honour of the Royal Philharmonic Society, its Gold Medal, in 1959. Foreign honours included the Order of the Polar Star (Sweden), 1956; the Order of the White Rose (Finland), 1965; and Chevalier of France&#x27;s Légion d&#x27;honneur, 1967.

After his death Sargent was commemorated in a variety of ways. His memorial service in Westminster Abbey in October 1967 was attended by 3,000 people including the royalty of three countries, official representatives from France, South Africa, and Malaysia, and notables as diverse as Princess Marina of Kent; Bridget D&#x27;Oyly Carte; Pierre Boulez; Larry Adler; Elgar&#x27;s daughter; Beecham&#x27;s widow; Douglas Fairbanks Junior; Léon Goossens; the Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music; the Secretary of London Zoo; and representatives of the London orchestras and of the Promenaders. Colin Davis and the BBC Chorus and Symphony Orchestra performed the music.

Since 1968, the year after Sargent&#x27;s death, the Proms have begun on a Friday evening rather than as previously a Saturday, and in memory of Sargent&#x27;s choral work, a large-scale choral piece is customarily given. Beyond the world of music, a school and a charity were named after him: the Malcolm Sargent Primary School in Stamford and the Malcolm Sargent Cancer Fund for Children. Merging with another charity (Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood) in 2005, it was renamed CLIC Sargent. In 2021 the charity was renamed again as Young Lives vs Cancer; it is the UK&#x27;s leading children&#x27;s cancer charity. In 1980 the Royal Mail put the image of Sargent on its 15p postage stamp in a series portraying British conductors. At Albert Hall Mansions, next to the Albert Hall, where Sargent lived, there is a blue plaque placed in his memory.

==Recordings==

Sargent&#x27;s own composition, &quot;An Impression on a Windy Day&quot;, has been recorded for CD by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Gavin Sutherland on the ASV label. Sargent&#x27;s first recordings as a conductor, made for HMV in 1923 using the acoustic process, were of excerpts from Vaughan Williams&#x27;s opera &quot;Hugh the Drover.&quot; In the early days of electrical recording, he took part in a pioneering live recording of extracts of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; at the Albert Hall with the Royal Choral Society.

Subsequently, in the recording studio, Sargent was most in demand to record English music, choral works and concertos. He recorded prolifically and worked with many orchestras, but made the most recordings (several dozen major pieces) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC), the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), the New Symphony Orchestra of London, the Philharmonia Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO).

===English music===
Sargent conducted Gilbert and Sullivan recordings in four different decades. His early recordings with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company for HMV included &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (1928), &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1929), &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1930), &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (1930), &quot;Patience&quot; (1930), &quot;Yeomen&quot; (excerpts 1931), &quot;Pirates&quot; (excerpts 1931), &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; (excerpts 1931), &quot;Ruddigore&quot; (1932) and &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1932). More than 30 years later, for Decca, he recorded &quot;Yeomen&quot; (1964) and &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1965) with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte company. In addition, between 1957 and 1963, Sargent recorded nine of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas for EMI, with the Glyndebourne Festival Chorus and soloists from the world of oratorio and grand opera. These were &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, &quot;Pinafore&quot;, &quot;Pirates&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, &quot;The Mikado&quot;, &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, &quot;Yeomen&quot; and &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;. According to the Gilbert and Sullivan scholar Marc Shepherd, &quot;The [Glyndebourne] recordings&#x27; musical excellence is undisputed, but many listeners object to Sargent&#x27;s lugubrious tempi and the singers&#x27; lack of feeling for the G&amp;S idiom.&quot; Sargent used an orchestra of thirty-seven players at the Savoy Theatre (the same number as Sullivan), but sometimes added a few more when recording.

During the Second World War, Sargent and the Liverpool Philharmonic accompanied Albert Sammons, the dedicatee, in his 1944 recording of the Delius Violin Concerto. Later, in 1965, with Jacqueline du Pré, in her début recording, Sargent recorded Delius&#x27;s Cello Concerto, coupled with the &quot;Songs of Farewell&quot; (1965). At the end of the war, Sargent turned to recording Elgar. The first of Sargent&#x27;s two versions of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; with Heddle Nash as tenor and the familiar Sargent pairing of the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra was recorded in 1945, and six decades later was still regarded as a classic. Sargent was the conductor for Heifetz&#x27;s 1949 recording of Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto and Paul Tortelier&#x27;s first recording of the Cello Concerto in 1954. He also recorded Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Wand of Youth Suite No. 2&quot;, with the BBC; the &quot;Pomp and Circumstance Marches&quot; 1 and 4 with the LSO; and the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; with the Philharmonia. He made two recordings of Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;: a monaural version with the LSO for Decca (1950) and a stereo version with the BBC for EMI (1960). He also recorded shorter Holst pieces: &quot;The Perfect Fool&quot; ballet music and the &quot;Beni Mora&quot; suite.

In 1958 Sargent recorded Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, one of his specialities, which was reissued on CD in 1990 and again in 2004. He recorded Walton&#x27;s &quot;Orb and Sceptre March&quot; and &quot;Façade Suites&quot;. He also made a stereo recording of Walton&#x27;s First Symphony in the presence of the composer, but Walton privately preferred André Previn&#x27;s recording, issued in January 1967, the same month as Sargent&#x27;s. Of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s shorter pieces, Sargent recorded, with the BBC in 1960, the &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot; (which he also recorded with the Philharmonia), and with the LSO, &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; (1957; choral version) and &quot;Toward the Unknown Region&quot;. He recorded Vaughan Williams&#x27;s overture &quot;The Wasps&quot; with the LSO.
Although the heyday of live performances of Sargent&#x27;s Coleridge-Taylor signature piece at the Albert Hall was by then long gone, Sargent, the Royal Choral Society and the Philharmonia made a stereo recording in 1962 of &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Wedding Feast&quot;, which has been reissued on CD. In 1963, Sargent recorded Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, one of his few operas on record other than Gilbert and Sullivan. This was also reissued on CD.

===Other choral recordings===
In addition to those choral pieces mentioned above, Sargent recorded Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; four times, in 1946, 1954 1959 and 1964. Though the advent of &quot;authentic&quot; period performance at first relegated Sargent&#x27;s large scale and rescored versions to the shelf, they have been reissued and are now attracting favourable critical comment as being of historical interest in their own right. Sargent also conducted the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the Huddersfield Choral Society in recordings of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; in 1947, both of which have been reissued on CD.

===Concertos===
Sargent was continually in demand as a conductor for concertos. In addition to the concertos noted above, other composers whose concertos he conducted on record, with soloists noted, include: Bach (Heifetz-Friedman, NSO), Bartók (Rostal, LSO), Beethoven (Oistrakh, Knushevitzky, Oborin, Philharmonia), Bliss (Trevor Barnard, Philharmonia), Bruch (Heifetz, LSO and NSO), Cimarosa (Léon Goossens, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic), Dvořák (Tortelier), Mendelssohn (Gioconda de Vito, LSO), Mozart (Heifetz, LSO), Rachmaninoff (Lympany, RPO), Rawsthorne (Curzon; Matthews, LSO), Rubbra (Matthews, LSO), Schumann (Pierre Fournier), Tchaikovsky (Ricci, NSO) and Vieuxtemps (Heifetz, NSO). Other soloists included Mstislav Rostropovich and Cyril Smith.

===Other recordings===
Neville Cardus said of Sargent&#x27;s Beethoven, &quot;I have heard performances which critics would have raved about had some conductor from Russia been responsible for them conducting them half as well and truthfully.&quot; Sargent recorded Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth and Fifth Symphonies for Decca with Sidney Beer&#x27;s National Symphony Orchestra. His 1940s accompaniments for Artur Schnabel in the piano concertos have been admired. A 1961 stereo recording of the &quot;Eroica&quot; Symphony has been reissued on CD. Sargent was an enthusiastic champion of Sibelius&#x27;s music, even recording it with the Vienna Philharmonic when it was not part of their repertory. Their recordings of &quot;Finlandia&quot;, &quot;En saga&quot;, &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot; and the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot; were issued in 1963 and reissued on CD in 1993. Sargent and the BBC recorded the First, Second and Fifth Symphonies in 1956 and 1958 respectively, reissued on CD in 1989, as well as &quot;Pohjola&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 1959. He also recorded the &quot;Valse triste&quot; with the RLPO.

Sargent recorded a wide variety of other European composers, including Bach&#x27;s Sinfonia from the &quot;Easter Oratorio&quot;, with Goossens and the RLPO; Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Les Sylphides&quot; ballet suite (LPO); Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; (National Symphony Orchestra); Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 98&quot; (LSO); Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Paganini Rhapsody&quot; (Cyril Smith, RLPO) among others; and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Prelude&quot; from &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; from &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. He also recorded Smetana&#x27;s complete &quot;Má vlast&quot; cycle with the RPO in 1964. With the Royal Opera Orchestra he recorded, among other pieces, Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; and &quot;La Boutique Fantasque&quot;, Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot;, and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony, &quot;Rosamunde&quot; and &quot;Overture Zauberharfe&quot;.

With the LSO, he recorded Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; and &quot;Night on the Bare Mountain&quot;, Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 and &quot;Lieutenant Kijé Suite&quot;, and Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 9. With the Philharmonia, he recorded, among other things, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot; and &quot;Theme and Variations from Suite No. 3&quot;, and Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;. With the BBC, he also recorded Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Symphony No. 3, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Water Music&quot;, which he also recorded with the RPO, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; incidental music, Humperdinck&#x27;s overture to &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;, and one of Britten&#x27;s best known works, &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra&quot; (1946, RLPO; 1958, BBC). He also conducted Britten&#x27;s &quot;Simple Symphony&quot; with the RPO. Sargent narrated and conducted &quot;Instruments of the Orchestra&quot;, an educational film produced by the British government.

<text>The American Express Company or Amex is an American bank holding company and multinational financial services corporation that specializes in payment cards. It is headquartered at 200 Vesey Street, also known as American Express Tower, in the Battery Park City neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. Amex is the fourth-largest card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa, and Mastercard. 141.2 million Amex cards were in force worldwide as of December 31, 2023, with an average annual spend per card member of US$24,059. That year, Amex handled over $1.7 trillion in purchase volume on its network. Amex is the 16th largest US bank, with a total of US$270 billion in assets or 1.1% of all assets insured by the FDIC. It is ranked 77th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 and 28th on the list of the most valuable brands by &quot;Forbes&quot;. In 2023, it was ranked 63rd in the &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000. Amex also owns a direct bank.

Founded in 1850 as a freight forwarding company, Amex introduced financial and travel services during the early 1900s. It developed its first paper charge card in 1958, gold card in 1966, green card in 1969, platinum card in 1984, and Centurion Card in 1999. The &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Home Without It&quot; advertising campaign was introduced in 1975 and renewed in 2005. In the 1980s, Amex acquired and then divested a stake in Shearson. In the 1990s, it stopped reducing interchange fees for merchants who exclusively accepted Amex cards and expanded market share through targeted marketing campaigns. Amex converted to a bank holding company during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Amex began operating airport lounges in 2013, offering access to certain cardholders.

Amex had a 9% worldwide market share by transaction volume in 2023. While American Express credit cards are accepted at 99% of U.S. merchants that accept credit cards (Costco being a notable exception), they are much less accepted in Europe and Asia. American Express offers various types of cards including travel and dining cards, everyday spending points cards, and cash back cards. Each category has several card options with different benefits and reward structures. High-profile cards like the Green, Gold, and Platinum cards cater to frequent travelers and diners with perks tailored to these activities.

==History==
===Early history===

In 1850, American Express was started as a freight forwarding company in Buffalo, New York. It was founded as a joint-stock corporation by the merger of the cash-in-transit companies owned by Henry Wells (Wells &amp; Company), William G. Fargo (Livingston, Fargo &amp; Company), and John Warren Butterfield (Wells, Butterfield &amp; Company, the successor earlier in 1850 of Butterfield, Wasson &amp; Company). Wells and Fargo also started Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in 1852 when Butterfield and other directors objected to the proposal that American Express extend its operations to California.

American Express initially established its headquarters in a building at the intersection of Jay Street and Hudson Street in what was later called the Tribeca section of Manhattan. For years it enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the movement of express shipments (goods, securities, currency, etc.) throughout New York State. In 1874, American Express moved its headquarters to 65 Broadway in what was becoming the Financial District of Manhattan, a location it was to retain through two buildings.In 1854, the American Express Co. purchased a lot on Vesey Street in New York City as the site for its stables. The company&#x27;s first New York headquarters was an 1858 marble Italianate palazzo at 55–61 Hudson Street, which had a busy freight depot on the ground story with a spur line from the Hudson River Railroad. A stable was constructed in 1867, five blocks north at 4–8 Hubert Street. The company prospered sufficiently that headquarters were moved in 1874 from the wholesale shipping district to the budding Financial District and into rented offices in two five-story brownstone commercial buildings at 63 and 65 Broadway that were owned by the Harmony family.

In 1880, American Express built a new warehouse behind the Broadway Building at 46 Trinity Place. The designer is unknown, but it has a façade of brick arches that are reminiscent of pre-skyscraper New York. American Express has long been out of this building, but it still bears a terracotta seal with the American Express Eagle. In 1890–91 the company constructed a new ten-story building by Edward H. Kendall on the site of its former headquarters on Hudson Street. By 1903, the company had assets of some $28 million, second only to the National City Bank of New York among financial institutions in the city. To reflect this, the company purchased the Broadway buildings and site.

At the end of the Wells-Fargo reign in 1914, an aggressive new president, George Chadbourne Taylor (1868–1923), who had worked his way up through the company over the previous thirty years, decided to build a new headquarters. The old buildings, dubbed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;among the ancient landmarks&quot; of lower Broadway, were inadequate for such a rapidly expanding concern.

After some delays due to the First World War, the 21-story neo-classical American Express Co. Building was constructed in 1916–17 to the design of James L. Aspinwall, of the firm of Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Tucker, the successor to the architectural practice of James Renwick Jr. The building consolidated the two lots of the former buildings with a single address: 65 Broadway. This building was part of the &quot;Express Row&quot; section of lower Broadway at the time. The building completed the continuous masonry wall of its block-front and assisted in transforming Broadway into the &quot;canyon&quot; of neo-classical masonry office towers familiar to this day. American Express sold this building in 1975, but retained travel services there. The building was also the headquarters over the years of other prominent firms, including investment bankers J.&amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co. (1940–74), the American Bureau of Shipping, a maritime concern (1977–86), and later J.J. Kenny, and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, the latter of which renamed the building for itself.

===National expansion===
American Express extended its reach nationwide by arranging affiliations with other express companies (including Wells Fargo – the replacement for the two former companies that merged to form American Express), railroads, and steamship companies. In 1857, American Express started its expansion in the area of financial services by launching a money order business to compete with the United States Post Office&#x27;s money orders. Sometime between 1888 and 1890, J. C. Fargo took a trip to Europe and returned frustrated and infuriated. Despite the fact that he was president of American Express and that he carried with him traditional letters of credit, he found it difficult to obtain cash anywhere except in major cities. Fargo went to Marcellus Flemming Berry and asked him to create a better solution than the letter of credit. Berry introduced the American Express Traveler&#x27;s Cheque which was launched in 1891 in denominations of $10, $20, $50, and $100.

Traveler&#x27;s cheques established American Express as a truly international company. In 1914, at the onset of World War I, American Express in Europe was among the few companies to honor the letters of credit (issued by various banks) held by Americans in Europe, because other financial institutions refused to assist these stranded travelers. The British government appointed American Express its official agent at the beginning of World War I. They were to deliver letters, money, and relief parcels to British prisoners of war. Their employees went into camps to cash drafts for both British and French prisoners and arranged for them to receive money from home. By the end of the war they were delivering 150 tonnes of parcels per day to prisoners in six countries.

In 1915, American Express established a travel division and soon established its first travel agency. Albert K. Dawson was instrumental in expanding business operations overseas, even investing in tourist relations with the Soviet Union. During World War I, Dawson was a photographer and film correspondent with the German army.

===End of railroad express business===

American Express was one of the monopolies that President Theodore Roosevelt had the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) investigate during his administration (1901–1909). The interest of the ICC was drawn to its strict control of the railroad express business. However, the solution did not come immediately to hand. The solution to this problem came as a coincidence to other problems during World War I. During the winter of 1917, the United States suffered a severe coal shortage and on December 26 President Woodrow Wilson commandeered the railroads on behalf of the United States government to move federal troops, their supplies, and coal. Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo was assigned the task of consolidating the railway lines for the war effort. All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country&#x27;s needs. This ended American Express&#x27;s express business and removed them from the ICC&#x27;s interest. The result was that a new company called the American Railway Express Agency formed in July 1918. The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies (the largest share of which, 40%, came from American Express, who had owned the rights to the express business over of railroad lines, and had 10,000 offices, with over 30,000 employees).

===1920s–1970s===
American Express executives discussed the possibility of launching a travel charge card as early as 1946, but it was not until Diners Club launched a card in March 1950, that American Express began to seriously consider the possibility. At the end of 1957, under American Express CEO Ralph Reed the company entered the business and by the launch date of October 1, 1958, public interest had become so significant that 250,000 cards were issued prior to the official launch date. The card was launched with an annual fee of $6, $1 higher than Diners Club, to be seen as a premium product. The first cards were made of paper, with the account number and card member&#x27;s name typed. In 1959, American Express became the first company to issue embossed plastic cards.

In 1966, American Express introduced the Gold Card for &quot;big-spending members&quot;.

In 1977, James D. Robinson III became chairman and CEO of the company.

In 1979, American Express acquired 50% of the cable subsidiary of Warner Communications, forming Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, for $175 million in cash and short-term notes. It owned two-thirds of MTV, Nickelodeon, and The Movie Channel. The venture was unprofitable, and, in 1985, Amex sold its 50% interest to Viacom for $450 million.

===1980s and 1990s===
In the 1980s, American Express embarked on an effort to become a financial services holding company and made several acquisitions, creating an investment banking arm. In mid-1981 it purchased Sanford I. Weill&#x27;s Shearson Loeb Rhoades, the second-largest securities firm in the United States to form Shearson/American Express. Shearson Loeb Rhoades itself was the culmination of several mergers in the 1970s as Weill&#x27;s Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. merged with Shearson, Hammill &amp; Co. in 1974, to form Shearson Hayden Stone. Shearson Hayden Stone then merged with Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower &amp; Co. (formerly Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co.) to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades in 1979. With capital totaling $250 million at the time of its acquisition, Shearson Loeb Rhoades was the second-largest brokerage firm, behind Merrill Lynch.

After the purchase of Shearson, Weill was given the position of president of American Express in 1983. Weill grew increasingly unhappy with responsibilities within the company and his conflicts with CEO James D. Robinson III. Weill soon realized that he was not positioned to be named CEO and resigned in August 1985. In 1984, American Express acquired Lehman Brothers and added it to the Shearson family, creating Shearson Lehman/American Express. Lehman CEO and former trader Lewis Glucksman became CEO of Shearson Lehman/American Express. In 1984, Shearson/American Express acquired &quot;Investors Diversified Services&quot; (IDS), bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products. In 1988, Shearson Lehman acquired the E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., a brokerage firm that was merged with the investment banking business. The investment banking arm was renamed Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.

In 1983, as part of Robinson&#x27;s plan to expand into international banking of wealthy clients, Amex acquired Trade Development Bank of Geneva from Edmond Safra for US$550 million and Safra became a member of the board of directors of Amex. TDB executives were excluded from important company decisions and Safra unsuccessfully tried to repurchase the bank. Safra then opened a competing bank. In response, American Express launched an international smear campaign against Safra by inaccurately reporting to news and media outlets in that Safra was being investigated by the FBI for being involved in the Iran–Contra affair, along with drug trafficking and the mafia. All of the accusations were confirmed to be false and led to the resignation of Harry L. Freeman, public relations chief of American Express, after admitting to the entire scandal. In July 1989, American Express publicly apologized to Edmond Safra and donated $8 million to the charity of his choice. In 1990, American Express sold its Swiss banking operations to Compagnie de Banque et d&#x27;Investissements, which led to the creation of Union Bancaire Privée (UBP).

In 1984, Amex launched the Platinum Card, billed as an &quot;ultra-exclusive&quot; credit card with a $250 annual fee. It was offered by invitation only to American Express customers with at least two years of tenure, significant spending, and excellent payment history.

In 1987, American Express introduced the Optima card, its first credit card product that did not have to be paid in full at the end of the month.

In 1991, a group of restaurants in Boston, including some that were exclusive to Amex, stopped accepting American Express while accepting and encouraging the use of Visa and Mastercard. The rationale was due to far lower fees as compared to American Express&#x27; fees at the time (which were about 4% for each transaction versus around 1.2% for Visa and Mastercard). The revolt, known as the &quot;Boston Fee Party&quot; (alluding to the Boston Tea Party), spread to over 250 restaurants across the United States, including restaurants in other cities such as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Visa offered to pay the Fee Party&#x27;s legal bills, and Discover Card was able to increase their acceptance among Boston restaurants by 375%. Kenneth Chenault, then head of Travel Related Services prior to becoming American Express CEO, cut fees to bring these restaurants back into the fold. American Express then shifted its focus from exclusivity to broadening acceptance, adding mainstream merchants like Walmart to the American Express network. American Express was, at the time, known for cutting its interchange fee to merchants and restaurants if they accepted only American Express and no other credit or charge cards. This prompted competitors such as Visa and Mastercard to file complaints as the tactics gave Amex exclusivity at restaurants. Capitalizing on this elitist image, American Express frequently mentioned such exclusive partnerships in its advertising. Aside from some holdouts including Neiman Marcus, which continued exclusivity until 2011, the practice largely ended in 1991.

In April 1992, American Express spun off First Data in an initial public offering.

In 1993, Harvey Golub became CEO of American Express. That year, American Express negotiated the sale of Shearson&#x27;s retail brokerage and investment management business to Primerica. The Shearson business was merged with Primerica&#x27;s Smith Barney to create Smith Barney Shearson.

In June 1994, American Express completed the spin-off of the remaining investment banking and institutional businesses as Lehman Brothers, ending its foray into the brokerage business.

In September 1994, the Optima True Grace card was introduced. The card was unique in that it offered a grace period on all purchases whether a balance was carried on the card or not, not charging interest on new purchases immediately for cards with unpaid balances. The card was discontinued a few years later.

In 1998, Amex launched the Blue credit card, targeted at young adults, in the UK after testing it in other countries. The card had a smart chip and users were encouraged to pay bills and get information via the company website. It launched in the US in 1999. A television media campaign for Blue adopted the 1979 UK Synthpop hit &quot;Cars&quot; by Gary Numan as its theme music.

In 1999, American Express introduced the high-fee Centurion Card, often referred to as the &quot;black card,&quot; which caters to an even more affluent customer segment. The card was initially available only to select users of the Platinum card. American Express created the card line amid rumors and urban legends in the 1980s that it produced an ultra-exclusive black card for elite users who could purchase anything with it.

===21st century===
In December 2000, American Express agreed to acquire the $226 million credit card portfolio of Bank of Hawaii, then a division of Pacific Century Financial Corporation In January 2006, American Express sold its Bank of Hawaii card portfolio to Bank of America (MBNA).

Until 2004, Visa and Mastercard rules prohibited issuers of their cards from issuing American Express cards in the United States. This meant, as a practical matter, that U.S. banks could not issue American Express cards. These rules were struck down as a result of antitrust litigation brought by the United States Department of Justice. In January 2004, American Express reached a deal to have its cards issued by MBNA. Initially decried by Mastercard executives as nothing but an &quot;experiment&quot;, the cards were issued beginning in October 2004. An agreement was reached regarding the acquisition of MBNA by Bank of America whereby Bank of America owned the customer loans and American Express processed the transactions. American Express dismissed Bank of America from its antitrust litigation against Visa, Mastercard, and other banks. The first card from the partnership, the Bank of America Rewards American Express card, was released on June 30, 2006.
In June 2005, American Express introduced ExpressPay, a contactless payment system based on wireless RFID. In July 2005, American Express issued the American Express Travelers Cheque Card, a stored-value card that serves the same purposes as a traveler&#x27;s cheque, but can be used in stores like a credit card. Amex discontinued the card in October 2007.

On September 30, 2005, American Express completed the corporate spin-off of its American Express Financial Advisors unit, Ameriprise Financial, to its shareholders and RSM McGladrey acquired American Express Tax &amp; Business Services (TBS).

In 2006, the UK division of American Express joined the Product Red coalition and issued a Red Card, donating with each purchase through The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to help African women and children with HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.

In late 2007, the company announced the Plum Card for small business owners.

In March 2008, American Express acquired the Corporate Payment Services business of General Electric, which primarily focused on providing purchasing card solutions for large global clients, for $1.1 billion in cash. The transaction added V-Payment to its product portfolio. V-Payment enables a tightly controlled, single-use card number.

In March 2008, Standard Chartered Bank acquired American Express Bank Ltd, the international banking subsidiary of American Express for $823 million.

On November 10, 2008, during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the company received Federal Reserve System approval to convert to a bank holding company, making it eligible for government assistance under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. At that time, American Express had total consolidated assets of about $127 billion. In June 2009, $3.39 billion in TARP funds were repaid plus $74.4 million in dividend payments. In July 2009, the company ended its obligations under TARP by buying back $340 million in Treasury warrants. As part of the conversion, the company reduced or closed many business lines of credit.

In 2009, American Express introduced the ZYNC charge card, a white card targeting young adults. The card was later discontinued.

In November 2010, the UK division of American Express was cautioned by the Office of Fair Trading for the use of controversial charging orders against those in debt. The company was one of four companies who were allegedly encouraging customers to turn their unsecured credit card debts into a form of secured debt.

In November 2011, Neiman Marcus, which gave general-purpose card exclusivity to American Express since the 1980s, began accepting cards using the Visa and Mastercard payment networks. In 2011, Amex launched the Blue Cash Preferred Card credit card.

In October 2012, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) required three American Express subsidiaries to refund an estimated $85 million to approximately 250,000 customers for illegal card practices between 2003 and 2012. Allegations included that American Express made misleading statements regarding signup bonuses, charged unlawful late fees, discriminated against applicants due to age, and failed to report consumer complaints to regulators. Also in October 2012, American Express and Walmart announced the launch of Bluebird, a prepaid debit card with roadside assistance and identity theft protection that can also be used as a substitute for a traditional transactional account whereby users can have payments deposited to the account and have insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

In October 2013, Amex sold most of its publications: &quot;Travel + Leisure,&quot; &quot;Food &amp; Wine,&quot; &quot;Executive Travel&quot;, &quot;Black Ink&quot;, and &quot;Departures&quot; magazines, to Time Inc. Time restructured the publications, which are now owned by Dotdash Meredith.
In 2013, the company opened its first airport lounge, offering access to certain cardmembers.

In March 2014, American Express announced the corporate spin-off its corporate travel business as American Express Global Business Travel and the sale of 50% of the business to an investor group led by Certares LP for $900 million.

Effective in 2016 in the United States, and in 2015 in Canada, Costco ended its relationship with Amex that had provided co-branded Costco membership cards since 2004. The cards issued by Costco in the United States were an extension of an exclusive deal between Costco and American Express dating from 1999. Costco was the last major US merchant that accepted American Express cards exclusively. Costco&#x27;s Canadian stores ended its exclusive deal with American Express in January 2015, in favor of one with Capital One and Mastercard. Citigroup became the exclusive issuer of Costco&#x27;s credit cards and Visa replaced American Express as the exclusive credit card accepted at Costco&#x27;s stores in the United States. All TrueEarnings card accounts and balances held by American Express were sold to Citigroup, and new Costco Anywhere Visa cards were sent to Costco members prior to the switch date. The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of American Express&#x27; billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio. The impact of losing the Costco card accounts was significant; in the first quarter without Costco cards, company profit dropped 10% and revenue dropped 5% compared to the previous year.

On March 1, 2017, ANZ announced that it was no longer issuing American Express cards, with them phased out entirely by August 5, 2017. In October 2017, American Express established a joint venture company, LianTong (), in China to operate its payment card brand locally. In June 2020, it obtained a local bank card clearing business license in China.

In a court case &quot;Ohio v. American Express Co.&quot; (2018), merchants filed a class action lawsuit against American Express and claimed that charging high fees to merchants is a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. According to the lawsuit, American Express charges significantly higher fees than other credit card providers. In January 2017, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court ruling that American Express could block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers to other cards, like those offered by Visa and Mastercard. In June 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the 2nd Circuit&#x27;s ruling.

In 2018, the Gold Card was converted to a credit card for UK residents, but remains a charge card in the US.

In March 2019, American Express acquired LoungeBuddy, a provider which offers pay-per-use access to select airport lounges worldwide. Also in March 2019, Amex reduced its presence in the European Union, due to changes to the EU&#x27;s banking regulations. In July 2019, Amex acquired Acompay, a digital payment automation platform. In September 2019, Pedestrian Group acquired American Express Openair Cinemas, which facilitated outdoor showings of films at 10 locations in Australia and New Zealand and was operated by Fairfax Events.

In 2020, American Express acquired Kabbage. In June 2021, the company&#x27;s first checking account for small businesses, Kabbage Checking, was launched. American Express also offers credit lines of $1,000 to $150,000 for small businesses, using Kabbage&#x27;s automated underwriting software. In January 2023, the Kabbage brand was renamed American Express Business Blueprint.

In January 2021, the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve launched an investigation into whether the company had misled potential corporate customers and used aggressive tactics while selling American Express cards in 2015 and 2016. In October 2021, Amex launched full-service business checking for small and mid-sized businesses under the American Express brand.

In March 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions, American Express suspended all operations in Russia and Belarus.

In July 2023, Amex agreed to pay $15 million to the US Treasury to settle an investigation accusing the company of failing to govern and oversee a third-party affiliate and for violation of regulations in efforts to retain small business customers. Net income for 2023 was $8.4 billion, 14% higher than expected. Also in 2023, the company undertook a restructuring, costing up to $277 million.

In June 2024, Amex acquired Tock, a restaurant reservation platform, further expanding its portfolio in dining reservations following its earlier acquisition of Resy.

In January 2025, American Express announced that it will pay about $230 million to settle U.S. criminal and civil probes into alleged deceptive practices in selling credit card and wire transfer products to small business customers. The company has agreed to pay $138.4 million, which includes about $108 million in fines, and entered a non-prosecution agreement to end criminal and civil probes by the U.S. Department of Justice.

===Financial history===
==Amex credit card benefits and fees==
===Specialized cards for businesses===
American Express has a specialized corporate meeting credit card. Another specialized American Express business card is the American Express Corporate Purchasing Card, which can be assigned to individual employees or departments. Reconciliation and accounting services are available to make these functions easier for the corporation.

===Non-proprietary cards===
Citibank, First National Bank of Omaha, USAA, Navy Federal, Synchrony Financial, and US Bancorp issue American Express cards. Citi issues the Macy&#x27;s and Bloomingdale&#x27;s American Express cards along with Citi-branded cards. US Bancorp issues American Express-branded cards for US Bank along with Elan Card Services, a subsidiary that issues credit cards on behalf of small to midsize banks. Some credit unions, including PenFed, also issue American Express cards. Until August 2023, Wells Fargo issued American Express cards under their own brand and for Dillard&#x27;s. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are the only Big Four banks in the U.S. that do not partner with American Express.

==Marketing and advertising==
===Card design===
The company logo, a gladiator or centurion, appears at the center of several cards. The figure and his pose evoke classical antiquity, demonstrate strength and stability, and the designs on these cards, especially the Green card, bear resemblance to those on the United States Federal Reserve Notes.

===Advertising campaigns===
====&quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Home Without Them&quot;====
In 1975, David Ogilvy of Ogilvy &amp; Mather developed the highly successful &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Home Without Them&quot; ad campaign for American Express Traveler&#x27;s Cheques, featuring Academy Award-winning actor Karl Malden. Malden served as the public face of American Express Travelers Cheques for 25 years. In the UK, the spokesman was Alan Whicker, a television personality.

After Malden&#x27;s departure, and as the card assumed importance over the traveler&#x27;s cheques, American Express continued to use celebrities, such as Mel Blanc and ballerina Cynthia Gregory. A typical ad for the American Express Card began with a celebrity asking viewers: &quot;Do you know me?&quot; Although he/she gave hints to his/her identity, the star&#x27;s name was never mentioned except as imprinted on an American Express Card, after which announcer Peter Thomas told viewers how to apply for it. Each ad concluded with the celebrity reminding viewers: &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Home Without It.&quot; The &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Home Without It&quot; slogan was revived in 2005.

====&quot;The Adventures of Seinfeld &amp; Superman&quot;====

American Express uses celebrities in advertising. Some notable examples include a late 1990s ad campaign with comedian Jerry Seinfeld, including the two 2004 webisodes in a series entitled &quot;The Adventures of Seinfeld &amp; Superman&quot;.

====&quot;My life. My card. / Are You a Cardmember?&quot;====
In late 2004, American Express launched the &quot;My life. My card.&quot; brand campaign, and later the &quot;Are You a Cardmember?&quot; brand campaign in 2007, both by Ogilvy &amp; Mather, featuring celebrities that use American Express cards including:
* Actors: Kate Winslet, Robert De Niro, Ken Watanabe, and Tina Fey;
* Duke University basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski;
* Fashion designers Collette Dinnigan and Diane von Fürstenberg; 
* Comedian and talk show hostess Ellen DeGeneres;
* Golfer Tiger Woods;
* Professional snowboarder Shaun White; 
* Tennis pros Venus Williams, Andy Roddick, and Andre Agassi; 
* Surfer Laird Hamilton;
* Manchester United manager José Mourinho;
* Film directors Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson, and M. Night Shyamalan;
* Singers Sheryl Crow, Alicia Keys and Beyoncé

====&quot;Animals&quot;====
In 2007, a two-minute black-and-white ad, entitled &quot;Animals&quot; and starring Ellen DeGeneres, won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.

====C. F. Frost====
Many American Express credit card ads feature a sample American Express Card with the name &quot;C. F. Frost&quot; on the front. This is not a fabricated name; Charles F. Frost was an advertising executive at Ogilvy &amp; Mather.

===Cause marketing===
American Express was one of the earliest users of cause marketing, to great success. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express Card, American Express would contribute one penny to the renovation of the Statue of Liberty. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7 million to the Statue of Liberty restoration project. What would soon capture the attention of marketing departments of major corporations was that the promotion generated approximately a 28% increase in American Express card usage by consumers.

In May 2007, American Express launched an initiative called the Members Project. Cardholders were invited to submit ideas for projects, and were told American Express was funding the winning project.

===Sponsorship===
Since 2011, American Express has a £100 million sponsorship agreement with football club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. The agreement includes naming rights over Falmer Stadium, Brighton training facilities and shirt sponsorship over the kits of the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, youth and disability teams

In May 2024, American Express became the official partner of F1 Academy, a female-only single-seater racing series founded by Formula One, for the 2024 season. The partnership deal include American Express&#x27; branding to appear on Jessica Edgar&#x27;s car livery and driver suit.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2016, at the Corporate Art Awards, American Express received the award from pptArt for &quot;the best international restoration programme: World&#x27;s Monument Watch&quot;. American Express is a sponsor of &quot;World Monuments Watch&quot;, launched in 1995 by World Monuments Fund.

==Workplace==
===Offices===

In April 1986, American Express moved its headquarters to the 51-story Three World Financial Center in New York City. After the September 11 attacks, American Express had to leave its headquarters temporarily because it was located directly opposite the World Trade Center and was damaged during the fall of the towers. The company began gradually moving back into its rehabilitated building in 2002. The company maintains major offices in Sunrise, Florida, Salt Lake City, and Phoenix, Arizona, with its main data centers in North Carolina and Phoenix.

AMEX Bank of Canada was founded in 1853, in Toronto. It has around 1,700 employees as of December 2020 in its head office at Sheppard, east of Highway 404 in Toronto (relocated from Markham, Ontario, a northern suburb of Toronto where it resided from 1985 to 2015), as well as an office in Hamilton, Ontario. The company began operations as a bank on July 1, 1990, following an order-in-council made by the Brian Mulroney government on November 21, 1988. This decision was not without controversy as federal banking policy at the time would not ordinarily have permitted American Express to operate as a bank. It is a member of the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) and a registered member of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), the federal agency insuring deposits at all of Canada&#x27;s chartered banks.

American Express has several offices in the UK, including a European Service Center in the Carlton Hill area of Brighton, England. The building was completed in 2012. It replaced American Express&#x27;s former building, Amex House, a large white tower block built in 1977 and surrounded by several other smaller offices around the city. The American Express European Service Center deals with card servicing, sales, fraud and merchant servicing. Official Europe, Middle East, and Africa HQ is located in the Belgravia district of Westminster, in central London, at Belgrave House on Buckingham Palace Road, SW1; other UK offices are based in Sussex at Burgess Hill and Manchester. In November 2009, Brighton and Hove City Council granted planning permission for American Express to redevelop the Amex House site.

The Japan, Asia-Pacific, and Australian Headquarters are co-located in Singapore, at 16 Collyer Quay, and in Sydney&#x27;s King Street Wharf area. The headquarters of Latin America and Caribbean division is in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

American Express also has a significant presence in India. Its two centers are located at Gurgaon, Haryana (Cyber City) and Bangalore, Karnataka (Bagmane capital).The Indian operations of American Express revolve around the back office customer services operations apart from the credit card business for the domestic Indian Economy, arguably the American Express campus in Gurgaon is the largest employee location by headcount for Amex and supports business continuity objectives of Amex including during Hurricane Sandy, the center works 24/7 and includes a co-located second building which was recently transferred to a third party service provider but does much work for Amex.

<doc id="326514" wikidata="Q316903" url="?curid=326514" title="Giuseppe Sinopoli">
<text>Giuseppe Sinopoli (; 2 November 1946 – 20 April 2001) was an Italian conductor and composer.

== Biography ==
Sinopoli was born in Venice, Italy, and later studied at the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory in Venice under Ernesto Rubin de Cervin and at Darmstadt, including being mentored in composition with Karlheinz Stockhausen. He also obtained a doctorate in medicine, with an emphasis on psychiatry, from the University of Padua, and completed a dissertation on criminal anthropology. He posthumously obtained a degree in Archeology, his thesis defense being previously arranged for the day that ended up being the day of his funeral.

== Career ==
Sinopoli began to make a name for himself as a composer of serial works, becoming professor of contemporary and electronic music at the Venice Conservatoire Benedetto Marcello in 1972, and a major proponent of the new movement in Venice for contemporary music. He studied conducting at the Vienna Academy of Music under Hans Swarowsky; and in Venice, founded the Bruno Maderna Ensemble in the 1970s. His single most famous composition is perhaps his opera &quot;Lou Salomé&quot;, which received its first production in Munich in 1981, with Karan Armstrong in the title role.

Sinopoli was appointed principal conductor of the Philharmonia in 1984, and served in this position until 1994, making a number of recordings with them, including music by Elgar and the complete symphonies of Mahler. Sinopoli was supposed to take over the position of chief conductor at Deutsche Oper Berlin in 1990. However, even before the start of his term he receded from his contract. He became principal conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden in 1992. He also joined the Bayreuth Festival&#x27;s roster of conductors. He is best known for his intense and sometimes controversial interpretations of opera, especially works by Italian composers and Richard Strauss. Sinopoli specialized in late-nineteenth century and early-twentieth century music, from Wagner and Verdi to Strauss, Mahler and the Second Viennese School. His conducting was the object of much controversy, especially in the symphonic genre, with some berating the &quot;eccentricity&quot; of his interpretations, while others praised the insightfulness of his often intellectual approach to works.

== Death and legacy ==
On 20 April 2001 Sinopoli suffered a heart attack while conducting Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. The performance was supposed to serve as a reconciliatory appearance and dedicated to the memory of the company&#x27;s chief director, Götz Friedrich. He was taken from the opera house to the German Heart Center in Berlin, where he was pronounced dead the following day. Two nights later, Marcello Viotti stepped in to conduct &quot;Aida&quot;, and dedicated his performance to Sinopoli&#x27;s memory. The funeral in Rome on 23 April was attended by the Italian President and Prime Minister, as well as a large contingent from La Scala.

His books include &quot;Masterpieces of Greek Ceramics from the Sinopoli Collection&quot;. He died two days before he was due to receive his Laurea in Archeology at Università La Sapienza in Rome.

Sinopoli&#x27;s last recordings include Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; and &quot;Friedenstag&quot;, as well as Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot;.

== Giuseppe Sinopoli Festival ==
Every October since 2005, Taormina Arte has dedicated a festival to Giuseppe Sinopoli, the artistic director of the Music section of the Taormina Festival from 1989 to 1997. The Giuseppe Sinopoli Festival celebrates the man not only as a musician and as a conductor but also as a composer, a doctor, an archaeologist and intellectual, with a variety of events from music and literature, theatre and art to conferences, exhibitions, publications and concerts. Every year the Festival welcomes important orchestras to Italy.

On the occasion of the first edition of the Giuseppe Sinopoli Festival the Sinopoli Chamber Orchestra was formed, in collaboration with the Conservatorio &quot;Arcangelo Corelli&quot; of Messina. The Orchestra, made up of young talented musicians, both pupils and teachers of the Conservatorio, mostly performs works by Sinopoli.

<doc id="326515" wikidata="Q2967586" url="?curid=326515" title="Chuck Brown">
<text>Charles Louis Brown (August 22, 1936 – May 16, 2012) was an American guitarist, bandleader, and singer known as &quot;The Godfather of Go-Go&quot;. Go-go is a subgenre of funk music developed around the Washington, D.C., area in the mid-1970s. While its musical classification, influences, and origins are debated, Brown is regarded as the fundamental force behind the creation of go-go music.

At the time of his death, he was still performing music and was well-known in the Washington, D.C., area. The song &quot;Ashley&#x27;s Roachclip&quot; from the 1974 album &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; by Brown&#x27;s band The Soul Searchers contains a drum break, sampled countless times in various other tracks. Brown&#x27;s R&amp;B hits include &quot;Bustin&#x27; Loose&quot;(1979) and &quot;We Need Some Money&quot;(1984).

== Early life: 1936–1963 ==
Brown was born on August 22, 1936, in Gaston, North Carolina. Brown&#x27;s mother, Lyla Brown, was a housekeeper. His father, Albert Louis Moody, was a United States Marine. Brown&#x27;s father, however, was not present in his life, and Brown lived in poverty. When Brown was six years old, he moved to Washington, D.C., and at 15 he started living on the streets. He did not graduate high school; after quitting school he decided to perform odd jobs to make money, including shining shoes.

In the 1950s, Brown was convicted of murder and served eight years in Lorton Correctional Complex. At first, the case was tried as aggravated assault; however, it was moved up to murder once the victim died. Brown stated that his actions were in self-defense. In prison, he traded cigarettes for a guitar, which was how his love for the instrument began. When Brown completed his sentence, he moved back to Washington, D.C., and worked as a truck driver, a bricklayer, and a sparring partner at multiple boxing gyms. He also started to perform at parties throughout the area; however, he could not play at venues that served liquor because his probation officer would not allow it.

==Music career==

Brown&#x27;s musical career began in the 1960s, playing guitar with many jazz musicians and soul singer Jerry Butler, joining Los Latinos in 1965. 

Brown also recorded go-go covers of early jazz and blues songs, such as &quot;Go-Go Swing&quot;, &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot;, Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;It Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing If Ain&#x27;t Got That Swing&quot;, &quot;Moody&#x27;s Mood For Love&quot;, Johnny Mercer&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;, Louis Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Run Joe&quot;, and T-Bone Walker&#x27;s &quot;Stormy Monday&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, he performed the theme music of Fox&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Sinbad Show&quot; which later aired on &quot;The Family Channel&quot; and &quot;Disney Channel&quot;. &quot;Bustin&#x27; Loose&quot; has been adopted by the Washington Nationals baseball team as its home run celebration song and was interpolated by Nelly for his 2002 number one hit &quot;Hot in Herre.&quot; 

He received his first Grammy Award nomination in 2011 for Best R&amp;B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocals for &quot;Love&quot; (with Jill Scott and Marcus Miller), from the album &quot;We Got This&quot;.

==Death and tributes==
Brown died on May 16, 2012, at Baltimore&#x27;s Johns Hopkins Hospital of multiple organ failure, including heart failure, at the age of 75. Several weeks before his death, he had postponed and canceled shows due to hospitalization for pneumonia. His interment was at Trinity Memorial Gardens in Waldorf, Maryland.

The Soul Rebels Brass Band, Rare Essence and Slick Rick performed a tribute concert and collaborated on June 21, 2012, in Washington, D.C., at the historic Howard Theatre which re-opened in April 2012.

===Artistry and legacy===
Brown played a blonde Gibson ES-335.

Brown is called the &quot;Godfather of Go-Go&quot; and was considered a local legend in Washington, D.C. Darryl Brooks, a local promoter who worked with Chuck Brown during his career, stated, &quot;He was a symbol of D.C. manhood, back in the day, because of the authority that he spoke with. He just spoke from a perspective that black men could understand.&quot; Andre Johnson, the leader of the go-go band Rare Essence, said that Chuck Brown &quot;influenced generations of people—not just one—a few generations of musicians around here.&quot; Vincent C. Gray, the mayor of Washington, D.C., said Brown was &quot;go-go&#x27;s creator and, arguably, its most legendary artist&quot;.

He influenced other go-go bands such as Trouble Funk, Experience Unlimited(EU), Rare Essence, Hot Cold Sweat, Junk Yard Band, AM/FM, Slug-Go, Redds &amp; the Boys, Anwan Glover, the Backyard Band, and Little Benny and the Masters.

==Awards and honors==
Brown was a recipient of a 2005 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States&#x27; highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

In 2009, the 1900 block of 7th Street NW, in Northwest Washington, D.C., between Florida Avenue and T Street, was renamed Chuck Brown Way in his honor.

On September 4, 2011, Brown was honored by the National Symphony Orchestra, as the NSO paid tribute to Legends of Washington Music Labor Day concert - honoring Brown&#x27;s music, as well as Duke Ellington and John Philip Sousa - with a free concert on the West Lawn of the Capitol. Brown and his band capped off the evening with a performance.

In 2014, the Chuck Brown Memorial Park in Langdon neighborhood, Washington, D.C., was built to honor Brown. It features a memorial wall honoring his life and achievements, as well as a sculpture called &quot;Wind Me Up, Chuck&quot;, signifying the &quot;call and response&quot; associated with go-go music.

<text>Jinhae District () is a district of Changwon, South Korea. This region is served by the Korean National Railroad, and is famous for its annual cherry blossom festival every spring.

The city front is on a sheltered, island-studded bay, and is almost completely surrounded by mountains covered with pine trees.
The emblem of Jinhae contains a cherry blossom.

==History==

Jinhae was developed as a naval base (Chinkai Naval Station) of the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Japanese occupation period in the early 20th century.

On July 1, 2010, Jinhae and its neighboring cities, Changwon and Masan, merged to form the city of Changwon, currently the seat of the Provincial Council of South Gyeongsang Province.
==Economy==

The city&#x27;s economy is primarily dependent on the Republic of Korea Navy personnel and their families or employees of the ROKN shipyard and base facilities. Today, Jinhae hosts major naval facilities and commands of the South Korean navy including Commander-in-Chief Republic of Korea Fleet (CINCROKFLT) and the Naval Academy.

Jinhae is part of a large urban corridor that links the adjacent cities of Masan and Changwon. These three cities merged as one in 2010, hence the name &quot;Jinhae District&quot; instead of &quot;Jinhae-si&quot;.

Moreover, the city is also host to the one of two US Naval bases in Korea, US Naval Fleet Activities, Chinhae.

==Cherry Blossom Festival (Gunhangje)==
Each spring the city hosts a ten-day festival, variously promoted as the Military Parade Festival or the Cherry Blossom Festival. Each spring over a million Koreans and other visitors crowd into the town to view the cherry blossoms and to see the street performers, carnival stalls and street lighting as well as the military parades which commemorate the victory of Admiral Yi Sun Shin over a Japanese invasion attempt

In April, the cherry blossoms start to bloom in the south of the Korean peninsula and the cherry blossom festivals begin to be held throughout the country, while displaying a strong regional flavor. (Suh, 2002) &quot;Cherry blossom festivals are presented at some ten locations in Korea including Jinhae, Gyeongju, Gunsan, Yeongam, and Yoido in Seoul, which annually attract millions of visitors. The Jinhae Naval Port Festival, a cherry blossom festival with a tradition of 40 years, includes a ceremony to commemorate the achievements of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. In Yeongam, where the cherry blossom festival is held together with the Wangin Culture Festival, there is a cherry blossom-lined walkway with 250 steps, as well as a parade of 1,000 lanterns. In Hadong, Gyeongsangnam-do province, a cherry blossom festival is staged in the area between the Hwagae marketplace and Ssangyesa Temple. Since the region has long been known for its traditional market, the cherry blossom festival events include an unveiling of a statue of a vendor, selection of a &quot;cherry blossom ssireum champion&quot; and &quot;cherry blossom singer,&quot; and a naturally formed cherry blossom archway, which is known as &quot;pathway leading to a wedding.&quot; (Yong, 2016) The Jinhae Gunhangje Cherry Blossom Festival where every year, an estimated 340,000 cherry trees burst into an ocean of pale pink blossoms. It is by far the largest and the most beautiful cherry blossom festival in South Korea. Along the Yeojwacheon Stream at night are also what you must do during the festival. Decorated with beautiful lanterns and colorful umbrellas, you will be swept away by a dazzling array of colorful splendor. These cherry blossom trees attract an estimated 1 million tourists to Jinhae every year. The festival is officially known as Gunhangjae (), or Naval Port Festival. Two of the best places to view the cherry blossoms are Yeojwacheon stream () and Gyeonghwa train station (). Gyeonghwa station. (Kim, 2000) In addition to Yeojwacheon Starlight Festival, Sokcheonhang Port Multimedia Fireworks Show. Another festival is the Cornelian Cherry Festival at Sangwi village. It is a smaller festival but it is worth taking the time to appreciate the brilliant Cornelian cherry flowers decorating the fields in the morning. Farmers driving their oxen to the fields in the early morning fog is a picturesque scene from Sangwi village that can be witnessed only during the early morning hours. The Sangwi village is usually crowded as a marketplace with its Cornelian cherry flowers still in full bloom, due to the many tourists who come to drink the sap from acer mono. If you avoid this hectic period, you will be able to return home with your heart filled with the vigor of spring. The Yeouido and Seokchon Cherry Blossom Festivals in Seoul. These festivals attract a large amount of the Seoul population, plus many tourists. The island of Jeju has a cherry blossom festival, but in recent years has been cancelled due to Covid. The final big festival takes place in Gyeongju. The Gyeongju chery blossom festival is one of the most distinctive on the Korean peninsula. It takes place in and around the old Silla kingdoms capital city. The cities roads are flanked by old growth cherry trees, as are the parks, burial mounds, and the temples located throughout the city and mountains.

<doc id="326518" wikidata="Q18169" url="?curid=326518" title="Korail">
<text>The Korea Railroad Corporation () is the national railway operator in South Korea. It is branded as KORAIL () and changed its official Korean name () in November 2019. Currently, KORAIL is a public corporation, managed by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation.

KORAIL operates intercity/regional, commuter/metro and freight trains throughout South Korea, and has its headquarters in Daejeon.

== History ==
Historically, the South Korean railway network was managed by the &quot;Railroad Administration Bureau&quot; of the Ministry of Transportation before 1963. On 1 September 1963, the bureau became an agency that was known as &quot;Korean National Railroad&quot; (KNR) in English. In the early 2000s, the split and public corporatization of KNR was decided by the South Korean government, and in 2003, KNR adopted the current KORAIL logo in blue to prepare for corporatization. On 1 January 2005, KNR was split into &quot;Korea Railroad Corporation&quot; (KORAIL), which succeeded railway operation with the KORAIL logo and name, and Korea National Railway (KR), which succeeded in railway construction and maintaining tracks.

== Finances ==
Fares are set according to distance.
KORAIL has posted losses every year for the last decade, with the exception of 2015.
In 2021 alone, the deficit was 1.1081 trillion won.
As of the end of 2021, the cumulative deficit is 18.66 trillion won.

Rail fares have been frozen since they were raised by 4.9% in 2011.

In the 2021 public institution management evaluation, KORAIL was given the lowest grade of E (extremely unsatisfactory).

== Services ==

Excluding the other high-speed service provider, SR, South Korean high-speed and intercity services are provided by KORAIL. Currently, KORAIL provides 5 classes of railway and metro services.

=== KTX ===

KTX (Korea Train eXpress) is currently the highest class of KORAIL services. KTX services are provided on the Gyeongbu HSR and Honam HSR, as well as their branches such as Gyeongjeon Line, Donghae Line, or Jeolla Line.

=== ITX ===
ITX (Intercity Train eXpress) are a group of intercity services. The first ITX service was introduced in 2012, which was named ITX-Cheongchun (ITX-청춘) on Gyeongchun Line.

Before the introduction of ITX services, intercity trains were named Saemaul-ho (), which borrowed its name from New Community Movement. Later, Saemaul-ho services are merged into ITX as ITX-Saemaeul (ITX-새마을). Currently, the remaining Saemaul-ho services are only operated on Janghang Line.

In late 2023, another new ITX train equivalent to ITX-Saemaeul was introduced and named ITX-Maum.

=== Mugunghwa-ho and Nuriro ===
Mugunghwa-ho () and its planned successor Nuriro () services are regional train services of KORAIL. Mugunghwa-ho, inspired by its name from the national floral emblem hibiscus, was introduced as express service at first, but after the introduction of KTX, it was degraded into regional services.

Currently, Nuriro services are provided by only EMU trains (class 20). KORAIL has a plan of introducing Nuriro with the newly ordered EMU-150.

=== Urban railway services ===

Named as metro services (), these services are provided in the Seoul Metropolitan Area and the Busan Metropolitan Area. Sometimes it is considered as a successor of Bidulgi-ho () class trains. Officially, the fare systems of these services are separate from other services operated by Korail; such services are integrated with subway fare systems, allowing free transfers between Korail-operated lines and local metro lines.

==== Seoul ====

== Sightseeing trains ==
KORAIL has a number of tourist or sightseeing trains, including the Sea Train, DMZ Train, V-Train, S-Train, A-Train, and G-Train.

== Passes ==
Korail offers a rail pass called Korea Rail Pass, or KR Pass for short, to foreign travelers, such that they can take most of the trains operated by Korail freely, including KTX. However, subways and tourist trains operated by KORAIL are not covered.

Foreigners living in South Korea for more than six months are ineligible to use a KR Pass, but Korail offers the Happy Rail Pass, which is very similar to the KR Pass, for a slightly higher price.

== Labor relations ==
Most of the railroad&#x27;s employees are members of the Korean Railway Workers&#x27; Union, which is frequently at odds with KORAIL management. Strikes, such as the South Korean railroad strike of 2006, are not uncommon.

In December 2013, 23,000–100,000 union members and friends protested the privatization of KORAIL in Seoul.

== Subsidiaries ==
*Korail Networks, for ticketing management and Korail frequent riders program.
*Korail Retail, for advertisement management and running &quot;Storyway&quot; convenience store.
*Korail Tour Service, for KTX/Saemaeul-ho train crew and travel service.

== International service ==
* North Korea (Korean State Railway): 
Until the division of Korea following the end of the Second World War, the Gyeongui Line and Gyeongwon Line extended into what is now North Korea. The Gyeongui Line connected Seoul to Kaesong, Pyongyang, and Sinuiju on the Chinese border, while the Gyeongwon Line served Wonsan on the east coast. Another line—the Kumgangsan Electric Railway—connected the town of Cheorwon, now on the border of North and South Korea, on the Gyeongwon Line, to Mt. Geumgang, now in the North.

The Gyeongui Line is one of two lines whose southern and northern halves are now being reconnected, the other line being the Donghae Bukbu Line. On 17 May 2007, two test trains ran on the reconnected lines: one on the west line from Munsan to Kaesong; the second on the east from Jejin to Kumgang.

In December 2007, regular freight service started on the Gyeongui line, from South Korea into the Kaesong Industrial Park in the north. The service has been underutilized, however: as it was reported in October 2008, on 150 out of 163 return trips that had been done so far, the train carried no cargo at all. The total amount of cargo carried over this period had been merely 340 tons. This absence of interest in the service has been explained by the customers&#x27; (companies operating in Kaesong) preference for road transport. In November 2008, North Korea shut down the link. However, railroad transportation from South Korea to North Korea resumed again on 30 November 2018, when a South Korean train carrying railroad inspectors entered North Korea.

A Trans-Korean Main Line, spanning North Korea and connecting to Russian Railways, is being planned. On 30 November 2018, 30 officials from North and South Korea began an 18-day survey in both Koreas to connect the Korean railroads. The survey, which had previously been obstructed by the Korean Demilitarized Zone&#x27;s (DMZ) &quot;frontline&quot; guard posts and landmines located at the DMZ&#x27;s Arrowhead Hill, consists of a -long railroad section between Kaesong and Sinuiju that cuts through the North&#x27;s central region and northeastern coast. The railway survey, which involved the inspection of the Gyeongui Line, concluded on 5 December 2018. On 8 December 2018, an inter-Korean survey began in both Koreas for the Donghae Line.

On 13 December 2018, it was announced that the groundbreaking ceremony to symbolize the reconnection of the roads and railways in both Koreas will be held on 26 December 2018 in the North Korean city of Kaesong. On 17 December 2018, the latest inter-Korean railway survey, which involved an 800-km rail from Kumgangsan near the inter-Korean border to the Tumen River bordering Russia in the east, was completed. A potential threat to the groundbreaking ceremony emerged after it was revealed that the North Korean railway was in poor condition. On 21 December 2018, however, the United States agreed to no longer obstruct plans by both Koreas to hold a groundbreaking ceremony. The same day, a four-day inter-Korean road survey began when ten working-level South Korean surveyors entered North Korea to work with ten North Korean surveyors on a three-day survey 100-km-long section on the eastern Donghae Line. On 24 December 2018, the four-day road survey, which will assist with the groundbreaking ceremony for the railroad, was completed after a separate team of ten South Korean surveyors entered North Korea and joined ten North Korean surveyors to survey a 4-km-long road in Kaesong. On 26 December 2018, the groundbreaking ceremony was held as scheduled in Kaesong. About 100 South Korean officials attended the ceremony after departing to North Korea on a Korail train based at Dorasan Station in Palu.

* Japan
JR Kyushu offers a jet foil ferry service between Busan and Fukuoka taking about 3 hours. KORAIL and JR West had a joint rail pass (called ) which included discounted KTX and Shinkansen tickets and Busan-Shimonoseki/Fukuoka ferry tickets, but the pass was discontinued due to low ridership.

There are no railway connections between both countries. The Korean Strait undersea tunnel connecting Fukuoka and Busan via Tsushima had been proposed as far back as 1917, but the plan has never progressed beyond the research phase. While the increased wealth of South Korea and continued growth of trade between the nations has made the economic case for the tunnel more compelling, promotion has focused more on using the project to reduce political tension between the nations.

<text>Gunsan (; ), also romanized as Kunsan, is a city in Jeonbuk State, South Korea. It is on the south bank of the Geum River just upstream from its exit into the Yellow Sea. It has emerged as a high-tech manufacturing industrial city and an international trade seaport that is approximately southwest of Seoul on the midwest coast of the Korean Peninsula.

Kunsan Air Base operated by the United States Air Force is in the city. To encourage investment, a free trade zone has been declared.

Dialect: Jeolla dialect

==History==
Gunsan was a small fishing village on the banks of the Geum River, near where the river spills into the Yellow Sea. It sits on the fertile western &quot;Honam&quot; plain where much rice is harvested. Gunsan became a port in the late 19th century largely due to pressure from the Japanese on the Koreans to ship rice to Japan. In 1899, Gunsan Port officially opened up to international trade. Gunsan was largely settled by Japanese during the period of the Japanese occupation, and was known as Gunzan. The old (now demolished) City Hall and the Customs House are of Japanese construction. After liberation from the Japanese in 1945, Gunsan began to grow slowly.

The Korean War of the 1950s left the Gunsan area relatively unscathed. The initial drive south by the Communist North Koreans pushed the United Nations and South Korean forces toward Busan so quickly that Gunsan was spared from protracted fighting.

Nevertheless, a battalion of Korean Marines, entrenched in the hills above Gunsan Port, withheld overwhelming communist forces. Their bravery created extra time for the evacuation of the town and port. The action is commemorated with a monument on the ridgeline where the heaviest fighting occurred. ()

The drive north by the United Nations forces occurred so rapidly that there was little direct confrontation in the area. After the cessation of hostilities, the United States Air Force occupied nearby Kunsan Air Base, which has affected Gunsan.

Kunsan Air Base was originally constructed, under Japanese direction, by reclaiming mudflats starting in around 1923. Kunsan Air Base has hosted a variety of USAF combat aircraft. The proximity of US service members to Gunsan has provided some economic growth to Gunsan, but the base&#x27;s influence has waned since the 1990s as a result of a more powerful and diversified Korean economy. The downtown shopping districts that catered to US troops have transformed into areas that are indistinguishable from surrounding areas that serve Korean shoppers. Only a few remaining stores hint at the area&#x27;s previous manifestation as an American shopping district. The small Okku-Silver Town (or more popularly America Town) caters to US troops. About from the main gate of Kunsan Air Base, America Town hosts bars, dance clubs, restaurants, and souvenir shops.

==Economy==
Today, Gunsan&#x27;s economy thrives on fishing, agriculture and heavy industry west of the city in the reclaimed area known as the Industrial Zone. GM Korea operated a factory here that assembled the Chevrolet Aveo worldwide and as the Holden Barina in Australia and New Zealand until 2018. Near the port, the Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle factory produces Daewoo trucks for the domestic and export markets. In the domestic market vehicles are sold under Daewoo brand; the Tata brand name is used for export due to the dilution of the Daewoo brand.

It is a major port, especially for rice shipments, and is a commercial center for the rice grown in the Geum basin. Rice processing and shipbuilding are important industries, and paper, lumber, rubber, and plastic are also produced. Originally a poor fishing village, Gunsan gained importance with the development of its port, which was opened to foreign trade in 1899. The Japanese, who ruled Korea from 1905 to 1945, further developed the city and port.

Just south of Gunsan is the newly opened Saemangum Seawall, the longest dyke in the world.

<doc id="326522" wikidata="Q489139" url="?curid=326522" title="Geum River">
<text>The Geum River is a major river of South Korea that originates in Jangsu-eup, North Jeolla Province. It flows northward through North Jeolla and North Chungcheong Provinces and then changes direction in the vicinity of Greater Daejeon and flows southwest through South Chungcheong Province before emptying into the Yellow Sea near Gunsan.

The river is long, making it the third longest in South Korea. The area of the Geum River Basin is . The upper part of the river flows slowly through part of the Noryeongsanmaek Mountains and is marked by extensive stream meandering. On the other hand, river curves on middle and lower parts of the river are more gradual and there is comparatively less stream meandering.

Tributary streams of the Geumgang include the Gap-cheon, Yugu-cheon, Miho-cheon, Unsan-cheon, Seokseong-cheon, and Nonsan-cheon. Several small alluvial plains including the Honam and Nonsan Plain have been formed by the flow of the Geumgang and its tributaries.

==History and Culture==
In the area of Buyeo County, the river bears the name Baengma-gang river, which means White Horse River. Numerous legends associate the ancient kingdom of Baekje with the Baengma. The Baengma River is the subject of a well-known song of the &quot;sin minyo&quot; tradition, &quot;Kkumkkuneun Baengma-gang&quot; (꿈꾸는 백마강, &quot;Dreaming Baengma-gang&quot;).

The Geumgang River and its tributaries were a means of cultural contact from prehistoric times (see Mumun Pottery Period) and into the Three Kingdoms of Korea through their ancient function as a transportation route that begins on the west coast and penetrates deep in the interior of the Peninsula. Bronze Culture flourished in this area from c. 850 B.C.-A.D. 100 (see Liaoning bronze dagger culture). Archaeological evidence suggests that some of the first complex societies in southern Korea briefly flourished in the valleys formed by tributaries of this river.

The Geumgang River Basin contained the chiefdoms of Mahan, and a former centres of the early kingdom of Baekje such as Ungjin (AD 475–525) and Sabi (AD 525–660) are located along the Baengma portion of the river.

The river&#x27;s Korean name (&quot;Silk River&quot;) is a homonym of the word for &quot;diamond&quot; () and should not be confused with Kŭmgang Mountain (금강산; 金剛山; &quot;Diamond Mountain&quot;) in North Korea.

==Economy==
Dams have been built on the Middle and Upper Geumgang to facilitate water for agriculture and industry. They include the Daecheong Dam and the Yongdam Dam. The city of Greater Daejeon and the farms and industries of South Chungcheong Province rely heavily on the Geum River and its tributaries.

The alluvial plains formed by the Geumgang and its tributaries are the locations of significant agricultural production in Korea.

<doc id="326523" wikidata="Q427972" url="?curid=326523" title="Rex Sacrorum">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, the rex sacrorum (&quot;king of the sacred things&quot;, also sometimes rex sacrificulus) was a senatorial priesthood reserved for patricians. Although in the historical era, the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was the head of Roman state religion, Festus says that in the ranking of the highest Roman priests (&quot;ordo sacerdotum&quot;), the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was of highest prestige, followed by the &quot;flamines maiores&quot; (&quot;Flamen Dialis&quot;, &quot;Flamen Martialis&quot;, &quot;Flamen Quirinalis&quot;) and the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. The &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was based in the Regia.
==Description==
During the Roman Republic, the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was chosen by the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; from a list of patricians submitted by the College of Pontiffs. A further requirement was that he be born from parents married through the ritual of &quot;confarreatio&quot;, which was also the form of marriage he himself had to enter. His wife, the &quot;regina sacrorum&quot;, also performed religious duties specific to her role. Marriage was thus such a fundamental part of the priesthood that if the &quot;regina&quot; died, the &quot;rex&quot; had to resign. The &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was above the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, although he was more or less a powerless figurehead.

The &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; wore a toga, the undecorated soft &quot;shoeboot&quot; &quot;(calceus)&quot;, and carried a ceremonial axe; as a priest of archaic Roman religion, he sacrificed &quot;capite velato&quot;, with head covered. The &quot;rex&quot; held a sacrifice on the Kalends of each month. On the Nones, he announced the dates of festivals for the month. On March 24 and May 24, he held a sacrifice in the Comitium. In addition to these duties the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; seems to have functioned as the high priest of Janus.

The &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was a feature of Italic religion and possibly also Etruscan. The title is found in Latin cities such as Lanuvium, Tusculum, and Velitrae. At Rome the priesthood was deliberately depoliticized; the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was not elected, and his inauguration was merely witnessed by a &quot;comitia calata&quot;, an assembly called for the purpose. Like the &quot;flamen Dialis&quot; but in contrast to the pontiffs and augurs, the &quot;rex&quot; was barred from a political and military career. After the overthrow of the kings of Rome, the office of &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; fulfilled at least some of the sacral duties of kingship, with the consuls assuming political power and military command, as well as some sacral functions. It is a matter of scholarly debate as to whether the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was a &quot;decayed king&quot; and it&#x27;s discussed if this figure was created during the formation of the Republic, as Arnaldo Momigliano argued, or had existed in the Regal period.

==Regina sacrorum==
As the wife of the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot;, the &quot;regina sacrorum&quot; (&quot;queen of the sacred things&quot;) was a high priestess who carried out ritual duties only she could perform. On the Kalends of every month, the &quot;regina&quot; presided at the sacrifice of a sow &quot;(porca)&quot; or female lamb &quot;(agna)&quot; to Juno. The highly public nature of these sacrifices, like the role of the Vestals in official Roman religion, contradicts the commonplace notion that women&#x27;s religious activities in ancient Rome were restricted to the private or domestic sphere. Unlike the Vestals, however, the &quot;regina sacrorum&quot; and the &quot;flaminica Dialis&quot; (the wife of the &quot;flamen Dialis&quot; or high priest of Jupiter) were complements to a male partner; these two priesthoods were gender-balanced and had shared duties.

While performing her rituals, the &quot;regina&quot; wore a headdress called the &quot;arculum&quot;, formed from a garland of pomegranate twigs tied up with a white woolen thread. The &quot;rex&quot; and &quot;regina sacrorum&quot; were required to marry by the ritual of &quot;confarreatio&quot;, originally reserved for patricians, but after the &quot;Lex Canuleia&quot; of 445 BC, it is possible that the &quot;regina&quot; could have been plebeian.

Inscriptions record the names of a few &quot;reginae sacrorum&quot;, including Sergia Paullina, the wife of Cn. Pinarius Cornelius Severus, shortly before 112 AD, and Manlia Fadilla around the 2nd/3rd century AD.

==Decline and later use==
The office of &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was not a highly coveted position among the patricians, for although the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; was technically superior to the pontiffs, the rank conferred no real political gain. Because of this there would be some years without a &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; at all. By the time of Antony&#x27;s civil war the office was entirely in disuse, but seems to have been revived later by Augustus as there was mention of it during the empire until it was probably abolished by Theodosius I.

<text>Iksan (; ) is a city and major railway junction in North Jeolla Province, South Korea.

The city center and railway junction was formerly called &quot;Iri&quot; (), but merged with Iksan County (&quot;Iksan-gun&quot;) in 1995.

The railway junction is located at the point where Jeolla and Janghangs meet the Honam Line and the Honam HSR and is served by frequent train service to/from Seoul, Daejeon, Gwangju, Mokpo, Jeonju, Suncheon, and Yeosu.

Jeonbuk National University Iksan campus (before, it was Iksan National College), the Won Buddhism Graduate School, Wonkwang Health Science College, and Wonkwang University are all located in Iksan.

This city is called &quot;The City of Jewelry&quot;. The Iksan Jewelry Museum opened in May 2002 next to a Dinosaur museum.

In late November 2006, Korean authorities quarantined a farm in Iksan and began culling poultry and livestock within a 3-kilometer radius to contain an outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus.

Local tradition includes the story of Seodong and Seonhwa, which was broadcast from 2005 to 2006 as &quot;Sedongyo&quot; and is also dramatized in the &#x27;Paradise in Autumn Festival.&#x27;

Festivals with various themes are held in Iksan, all reflecting local history and culture. These include:

* 10,000,000 Chrysanthemum Festival (held in October/November) 
* Iksan Jewelry Expo 
* Seodong Festival 
* Stone Culture Festival

Anthem: Song of Citizens of Iksan

Iksan&#x27;s population is 269,429 as of January 2024.

==History==
Iksan was once the capital of the ancient Baekje Kingdom. Temples built then are still standing. Iksan has always been an important transport center. After the Iri train station explosion in 1977, Iksan fell into a state of decline. However, the city&#x27;s train station was later rebuilt, and it became the junction of three rail lines named above. It now services KTX and Saemaul trains as well as frequent bus lines. Today, Iksan is once again a thriving city.

==Geography==

Iksan is situated on the Okgu and Keumman Plains, which lead to the West Sea [Yellow Sea]. As it is located very near the sea where ships can transport a wide variety of products, Iksan has served as a logistical and traffic center for a long time.

The city is in the northwestern part of Jeollabuk-do. East are the rugged mountains of Mt. Cheonho and Mt. Mireuk (Mireuksan (Jeollabuk-do)) at the edge of the Noryeong Mountains, and northwest the range of Mt. Hamra lead to a series of hills and a great stream that has formed the fertile Okgu plain to the west. Iksan borders Nonsan-gun and Buyeo-gun, Chuncheongnam-do, and is divided by the Keum-gang[river] in the north. It faces the Kimje Plains, divided by Mankyeong-gang, to the south.

<doc id="326527" wikidata="Q474757" url="?curid=326527" title="Thermidorian Reaction">
<text>In the historiography of the French Revolution, the Thermidorian Reaction ( or &quot;Convention thermidorienne&quot;, &quot;Thermidorian Convention&quot;) is the common term for the period between the ousting of Maximilien Robespierre on 9 Thermidor II, or 27 July 1794, and the inauguration of the French Directory on 2 November 1795.

The &quot;Thermidorian Reaction&quot; was named after the month in which the coup took place and was the latter part of the National Convention&#x27;s rule of France. It was marked by the end of the Reign of Terror, decentralization of executive powers from the Committee of Public Safety and a turn from the radical Jacobin policies of the Montagnard Convention to more moderate positions. 

Economic and general populism, dechristianization, and harsh wartime measures were largely abandoned, as the members of the convention, disillusioned and frightened of the centralized government of the Terror, preferred a more stable political order that would have the approval of the plurality. The Reaction saw the Left suppressed by brutal force, including massacres, as well as the disbanding of the Jacobin Club, the dispersal of the sans-culottes, and the renunciation of the Montagnard ideology.

== Etymology and definitions ==
The name &quot;Thermidorian&quot; originated with 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794), the date according to the French Republican Calendar when Maximilien Robespierre and other radical revolutionaries came under concerted attack in the National Convention. &quot;Thermidorian Reaction&quot; refers to the remaining period until the National Convention was superseded by the Directory; this is also sometimes called the era of the Thermidorian Convention. Prominent figures of Thermidor include Paul Barras, Jean-Lambert Tallien, and Joseph Fouché.

== Background ==
Conspiracies against Robespierre, who had dominated the Committee of Public Safety, came together on 9 Thermidor (27 July) 1794. Jean-Lambert Tallien, a member of and previously President of the National Convention, impugned Saint-Just and then went on to denounce the tyranny of Robespierre. The attack was taken up by Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne. Cries went up of &quot;Down with the tyrant! Arrest him!&quot; Robespierre then made his appeal to the deputies of the Right, yet failed. An order was made to arrest Robespierre and his followers.

Troops from the Paris Commune, who were loyal to Robespierre, arrived to liberate him and the other prisoners. The Convention responded by ordering troops of its own under Paul Barras to counteract. The Robespierrists barricaded at the Hôtel de Ville. The Convention declared them to be outlaws, meaning that they could be executed within 24 hours without a trial. The Commune forces at the Hôtel de Ville deserted. The Convention troops under Barras approached the Hôtel around 2 a.m. on 28 July. Robespierre, his jaw broken by a possibly self-inflicted shot, was taken with most of his supporters.
On that very day, Robespierre was executed with twenty-one of his closest associates, including François Hanriot, ex-commander of the Parisian National Guard; Jean-Baptiste Fleuriot-Lescot, mayor of Paris; Georges Couthon, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just and René-François Dumas, ex-president of the Revolutionary Tribunal.

== The Reaction ==
The events of 9 Thermidor proved a watershed in the revolutionary process. The Thermidorian regime that followed proved to be an unpopular one, facing many rebellions after its execution of Robespierre and his allies, along with seventy members of the Paris Commune, the largest mass execution to have ever taken place in Paris. This led to a very fragile situation in France.

The hostility toward Robespierre did not just vanish with his execution. Instead, the people decided to blame those who were involved with Robespierre in any way, namely the many members of the Jacobin Club, their supporters, and individuals suspected of being past revolutionaries. The massacre of these groups became known as the White Terror, and was partially carried out by the Muscadin, a group of dandyish street fighters organized by the new government.

Often, members of these targeted groups were the victims of prison massacres or put on trial without due process, which were overall similar conditions to those provided to the counter-revolutionaries during the Reign of Terror. At the same time, its economic policies paved the way for rampant inflation. Ultimately, power devolved to the hands of the Directory, an executive of five men who assumed power in France in November 1795, in year III of the French Revolutionary calendar.

The Thermidorian regime excluded the remaining Montagnards from power, even those who had joined in conspiring against Robespierre and Saint-Just. The White Terror of 1795 resulted in numerous imprisonments and several hundred executions, almost exclusively of people on the political left. These numbers, while significant, were considerably smaller than those associated with the previous Reign of Terror, which killed over 40,000. Many executions took place without a trial.
On July 29 the victors of the 9th Thermidor condemned seventy members of the Paris Commune to death; thereafter the Commune was subject to the convention.

As part of the reorganization of French politics, practitioners of the terror were called to defend their records; some such as Tallien, Barras, Fouché and Fréron rejoined the leadership. Others such as Billaud-Varenne, Collot d&#x27;Herbois, Barère and Vadier were sentenced to exile in South America, though the latter two managed to evade arrest. Many Jacobin clubs were closed. Freedom of worship was extended first to the Vendée and later to all France. On 24 December 1794, the Maximum (controls on prices and wages) was abolished. The government exacerbated this inflationary move by issuing more assignats.

In April and May 1795, protests and riots in support of the radicals broke out culminating in an invasion of the convention by an insurrectionist mob on 20 May. On 22 May the Convention struck back, having troops under Pichegru surround the Faubourg St-Antoine and force the capitulation of the armed rebels. In May and June 1795, a &quot;White Terror&quot; raged in which Jacobins were victims and the judges were bourgeois &quot;Moderates&quot;. Throughout France the events of the September Massacres were repeated; however this time the victims were imprisoned officials of the Terror. In Paris, Royalist sentiments were openly tolerated.

Meanwhile, French armies overran the Netherlands and established the Batavian Republic, occupied the left bank of the Rhine and forced Spain, Prussia and several German States to sue for peace, enhancing the prestige of the convention. A new constitution called the Constitution of the Year III was drawn up on 22 August 1795, which eased back some of the democratic elements of the constitution of 1793, establishing an electoral college for the election of officials, a bicameral legislature and other provisions designed to protect the current holders of power. On 5 October (13 Vendémiaire), a revolt led by Royalists challenged the convention. It was put down by troops led by general Napoleon Bonaparte with &quot;a whiff of grapeshot&quot;. On 25 October the Convention declared itself dissolved and was replaced by the Directory on 2 November 1795.

== Other uses of the term ==
For historians of revolutionary movements, the term &quot;Thermidor&quot; has come to mean the phase in some revolutions when power slips from the hands of the original revolutionary leadership and a radical regime is replaced by a more conservative regime, sometimes to the point where the political pendulum may swing back towards something resembling a pre-revolutionary state.

=== In relation to the USSR ===
Leon Trotsky in his book &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot;, alleged that the rise of Joseph Stalin to power was a Soviet Thermidor for &#x27;not restoring capitalism&#x27;, yet still being a &#x27;counterrevolutionary regression&#x27; within the regime of the USSR, as Thermidor did not itself restore a monarchy, etc.

Uttaldo Buttafava, a self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist stated that the end of Stalin&#x27;s rule, Nikita Khruschev&#x27;s rise to power in Russia, and the economic policies of the time were a kind of Thermidor within the Soviet Union. 

A CIA document considered Khruschev&#x27;s &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot; may have &#x27;marked the &quot;Thermidor&quot; of the Russian Revolution&#x27;.

<text>Trevor David Pinnock (born 16 December 1946 in Canterbury, England) is a British harpsichordist and conductor.

He is best known for his association with the period-performance orchestra The English Concert, which he helped found and directed from the keyboard for over 30 years in baroque and classical music. He is a former artistic director of Canada&#x27;s National Arts Centre Orchestra and founded The Classical Band in New York.

Since his resignation from The English Concert in 2003, Pinnock has continued his career as a conductor, appearing with major orchestras and opera companies around the world. He has also performed and recorded as a harpsichordist in solo and chamber music and conducted and otherwise trained student groups at conservatoires. Trevor Pinnock won a Gramophone Award for his recording of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot; with the European Brandenburg Ensemble, an occasional orchestra formed to mark his 60th birthday.

==Biography and career==

===Early life===
Trevor Pinnock was born in Canterbury, where his grandfather had run a Salvation Army band. His father was Kenneth Alfred Thomas Pinnock, a publisher, and his mother, Joyce Edith, née Muggleton, was an amateur singer. In Canterbury, the Pinnock family lived near the pianist Ronald Smith, from whose sister Pinnock had piano lessons. He became a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral when he was seven, attending the choir school from 1956 to 1961 and subsequently Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys. After receiving instruction in piano and organ, he served as a church organist; by the time he was 15, he began to play the harpsichord. At age 19, he won a Foundation Scholarship to the Royal College of Music to study organ and he also studied harpsichord, winning prizes for performance on both instruments. His teachers were Ralph Downes and Millicent Silver. A strong early influence was Gustav Leonhardt, though he did not study with him.

===Instrumentalist===
As a harpsichordist, Pinnock toured Europe with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. While a student at the RCM, he was told by the registrar, John Stainer, that it would be impossible to make a living as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments. His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.

To maximise his possibilities for work early on in his career, he included in his repertoire not only the regular baroque repertoire, but also modern harpsichord concertos, including Roberto Gerhard&#x27;s concerto for harpsichord, percussion and strings, Manuel de Falla&#x27;s concerto for harpsichord, Frank Martin&#x27;s &quot;Petite symphonie concertante&quot; for harp, harpsichord, piano and double string orchestra and Francis Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Concert Champêtre&quot;. Pinnock and Maxim Vengerov toured together in 2000, with Vengerov taking up the baroque violin for the first time and Pinnock taking up the modern grand piano. These concerts consisted of a first half of harpsichord and baroque violin, followed by a second half of piano and modern violin.

===The English Concert===
In November 1972 the Galliard Trio expanded to become The English Concert, an orchestra specialising in performances of baroque and classical music on period instruments. The orchestra initially started with seven members but soon grew in size. The decision to move to period performance was taken for a number of reasons:

Pinnock was at the forefront of the period performance movement and the revitalisation of the baroque repertoire; the reaction of Leonard Bernstein to his performances is typical: &quot;In my opinion, the work of the conductor Trevor Pinnock in this area is particularly exciting – his performances of Bach and Handel make me jump out of my seat!&quot;

The English Concert&#x27;s London debut was at the English Bach Festival in 1973. In 1975, Pinnock played the harpsichord in the first-ever performance of Rameau&#x27;s last opera, &quot;Les Boréades&quot;, under John Eliot Gardiner.
He toured North America with The English Concert for the first time in 1983; he had earlier spent two periods as &quot;Artist in Residence&quot; at Washington University in St. Louis. His debut at The Proms was in 1980; he later directed Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Solomon&quot; in 1986 and many other large-scale works with his orchestra. They toured worldwide and made numerous recordings, Pinnock directing &quot;with a characteristic energy and enthusiasm which are readily communicated to audiences.&quot; The Choir of the English Concert was at first an ad-hoc group of singers assembled as needed, originally in 1983 for the first 20th-century performance of Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Acante et Céphise&quot;; it became an established choir for a period from the mid-1990s at the time they were performing Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor. This allowed the ensemble to regularly perform baroque operas, oratorios and other vocal works; a series of Bach&#x27;s major choral works followed.

He directed The English Concert, usually from the harpsichord or chamber organ, for over 30 years, deciding, with the other orchestra members, to hand it over to violinist Andrew Manze in 2003. He explained the decision as follows:

===Other conducting projects===
In 1989 Pinnock founded The Classical Band in New York, signing an 18-disc recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon before the ensemble&#x27;s first rehearsal. He led the group in performances of the classical and romantic repertoire from Haydn to Mendelssohn on period instruments, including playing as fortepiano soloist. After a disappointing series of concerts, he resigned in 1990 and was succeeded by Bruno Weil.

From 1991 to 1996 he was artistic director and principal conductor of the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, a group he had first directed in 1985. He subsequently served as its artistic advisor during the 1996–1997 and 1997–1998 seasons, including a tour of the US with the performance and recording of Beethoven&#x27;s 1st and 5th piano concertos with Grigory Sokolov as soloist. He has made occasional return visits to the orchestra since relinquishing his formal position with them.

====Guest conducting====
He has appeared frequently as a guest conductor with many of the world&#x27;s leading orchestras, including the Boston, City of Birmingham, San Francisco and Detroit symphony orchestras, the Saint Paul, Los Angeles and Mito chamber orchestras, the Freiburger Barockorchester, Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg, Berlin Philharmoniker, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic Orchestra and at the Tanglewood, Mostly Mozart and Salzburg festivals. He is a regular guest conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie

He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1988 conducting Handel&#x27;s opera &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, the same year he made his debut at the Salzburg Festival with Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.
He conducted Opera Australia and Michael Chance in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Rinaldo&quot; at the Sydney Opera House in 2005. He also played William Babell&#x27;s virtuoso harpsichord transcriptions with some of the arias (which Babell claimed were of Handel&#x27;s actual improvisations).

===Recent years===

Since resigning his position with The English Concert, Pinnock has divided his time between performing as a harpsichordist and conducting both modern- and period-instrument orchestras. He has also taken an interest in educational projects.

In 2004 he commissioned modern harpsichord music by English composer John Webb, whose &quot;Surge&quot; (2004) &quot;is built up over an implacable rhythmic repeat-figure. Though neither is explicitly tonal, each skilfully avoids the merely percussive effect that the harpsichord&#x27;s complex overtones can all too easily impart to more densely dissonant music.&quot; He has also played the same composer&#x27;s &quot;Ebb&quot; (2000), which &quot;comprises a spasmodic discourse against a manic background of descending scale patterns like a kind of out-of-kilter change-ringing&quot;.

He toured Europe and the Far East in 2007 with the European Brandenburg Ensemble, a baroque orchestra, formed to mark his 60th birthday by recording Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot; and performing popular baroque music. Its recording of the concertos won the Gramophone Award for Baroque Instrumental in 2008. The band was not a permanent orchestra, but planned to reconvene in 2011 when Bach&#x27;s &quot;St John Passion&quot; was to be the focus of their work.

Pinnock&#x27;s educational work takes place both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. It includes being principal guest conductor of the Royal Academy of Music&#x27;s Concert Orchestra, taking masterclasses or workshops at other British universities, and conducting the orchestras of such establishments as Mozarteum University of Salzburg and The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. He has also taught a handful of harpsichordists including Lars Ulrik Mortensen, Nicholas Parle, Carole Cerasi and Julian Perkins.

== Degrees, honours and awards ==
Pinnock gained ARCM Hons (organ) (1965), FRCM (1996), and Hon. FRAM (1988). His honorary doctorates include those from the University of Ottawa (D. University) in 1993, the University of Kent (DMus) in 1995, and the University of Sheffield (DMus) in 2005.

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1992 and an &quot;Officier&quot; of the French &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; in 1998.

Pinnock received three nominations for Grammy Awards for his recordings of Handel&#x27;s Coronation Anthems (1984), Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot; and Alessandro Scarlatti&#x27;s &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot; (1989) and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; (1990).

<text>YAML (; see ) is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax that intentionally differs from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). It uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting and does not require quotes around most string values (it also supports JSON style and codice_1 mixed in the same file).

Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively encodes scalars (such as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays (also known as maps, dictionaries or hashes). These data types are based on the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level programming languages share very similar concepts. The colon-centered syntax, used for expressing key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic mail headers as defined in , and the document separator is borrowed from MIME (). Escape sequences are reused from C, and whitespace wrapping for multi-line strings is inspired by HTML. Lists and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree structure; arbitrary graphs can be represented using YAML aliases (similar to XML in SOAP). YAML is intended to be read and written in streams, a feature inspired by SAX.

Support for reading and writing YAML is available for many programming languages. Some source-code editors such as Vim, Emacs, and various integrated development environments have features that make editing YAML easier, such as folding up nested structures or automatically highlighting syntax errors.

The official recommended filename extension for YAML files has been since 2006. In 2024, the MIME type has been finalized.

==History and name==
YAML (, rhymes with &quot;camel&quot;) was first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001, who designed it together with Ingy döt Net and Oren Ben-Kiki. Originally YAML was said to mean &quot;Yet Another Markup Language&quot;, because it was released in an era that saw a proliferation of markup languages for presentation and connectivity (HTML, XML, SGML, etc.). Its initial name was intended as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the technology landscape, referencing its purpose as a markup language with the yet another construct, but it was then repurposed as &quot;YAML Ain&#x27;t Markup Language&quot;, a recursive acronym, to distinguish its purpose as data-oriented, rather than document markup.

==Versions==
==Design==
===Syntax===

A cheat sheet and full specification are available at the official site. The following is a synopsis of the basic elements.

YAML accepts the entire Unicode character set, except for some control characters, and may be encoded in any one of UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. (Though UTF-32 is not mandatory, it is required for a parser to have JSON compatibility.)

* Whitespace indentation is used for denoting structure; however, tab characters are not allowed as part of that indentation.
* Comments begin with the number sign (), can start anywhere on a line and continue until the end of the line. Comments must be separated from other tokens by whitespace characters. If characters appear inside of a string, then they are number sign () literals.
* List members are denoted by a leading hyphen () with one member per line.
** A list can also be specified by enclosing text in square brackets () with each entry separated by a comma.
* An associative array entry is represented using colon space in the form &quot;key: value&quot; with one entry per line. YAML requires the colon be followed by a space so that url-style strings like can be represented without needing to be enclosed in quotes.
** A question mark can be used in front of a key, in the form &quot;?key: value&quot; to allow the key to contain leading dashes, square brackets, etc., without quotes.
** An associative array can also be specified by text enclosed in curly braces (), with keys separated from values by colon and the entries separated by commas (spaces are not required to retain compatibility with JSON).
* Strings (one type of scalar in YAML) are ordinarily unquoted, but may be enclosed in double-quotes (), or single-quotes ().
** Within double-quotes, special characters may be represented with C-style escape sequences starting with a backslash (). According to the documentation the only octal escape supported is .
** Within single quotes the only supported escape sequence is a doubled single quote () denoting the single quote itself as in .
* Block scalars are delimited with indentation with optional modifiers to preserve (codice_2) or fold () newlines.
* Multiple documents within a single stream are separated by three hyphens ().
** Three periods () optionally end a document within a stream.
* Repeated nodes are initially denoted by an ampersand () and thereafter referenced with an asterisk ().
* Nodes may be labeled with a type or tag using a double exclamation mark () followed by a string, which can be expanded into a URI.
* YAML documents in a stream may be preceded by &#x27;directives&#x27; composed of a percent sign () followed by a name and space-delimited parameters. Two directives are defined in YAML 1.1:
** The %YAML directive is used for identifying the version of YAML in a given document.
** The %TAG directive is used as a shortcut for URI prefixes. These shortcuts may then be used in node type tags.

===Basic components===

Conventional block format uses a hyphen+space to begin a new item in list.

--- # Favorite movies
- Casablanca
- North by Northwest
- The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There
Optional inline format is delimited by comma+space and enclosed in brackets (similar to JSON).

--- # Shopping list
[milk, pumpkin pie, eggs, juice]
Keys are separated from values by a colon+space. Indented blocks, common in YAML data files, use indentation and new lines to separate the key/value pairs. Inline Blocks, common in YAML data streams, use comma+space to separate the key/value pairs between braces.

--- # Indented Block
 name: John Smith
 age: 33
--- # Inline Block
{name: John Smith, age: 33}
Strings do not require quotation marks. There are two ways to write multi-line strings, one preserving newlines (using the codice_2 character) and one that folds the newlines (using the character), both followed by a newline character.

By default, the leading indentation (of the first line) and trailing whitespace are stripped, though other behavior can be explicitly specified.

--- # The Smiths

 age: 27
- [name, age]: [Rae Smith, 4] # sequences as keys are supported
--- # People, by gender
men: [John Smith, Bill Jones]
women:
 - Mary Smith
 - Susan Williams
Objects and lists are important components in yaml and can be mixed. The first example is a list of key-value objects, all people from the Smith family. The second lists them by gender; it is a key-value object containing two lists.

===Advanced components===
Two features that distinguish YAML from the capabilities of other data-serialization languages are structures and data typing.

YAML structures enable storage of multiple documents within a single file, usage of references for repeated nodes, and usage of arbitrary nodes as keys.

For clarity, compactness, and avoiding data entry errors, YAML provides node anchors (using ) and references (using ). References to the anchor work for all data types (see the ship-to reference in the example below).

Below is an example of a queue in an instrument sequencer in which two steps are referenced without being fully described.
--- # Sequencer protocols for Laser eye surgery
- step: &amp;id001 # defines anchor label &amp;id001
 instrument: Lasik 2000
 pulseEnergy: 5.4
 pulseDuration: 12
 repetition: 1000
 spotSize: 1mm

- step: &amp;id002
 instrument: Lasik 2000
 pulseEnergy: 5.0
 pulseDuration: 10
 repetition: 500
 spotSize: 2mm
- Instrument1: *id001 # refers to the first step (with anchor &amp;id001)
- Instrument2: *id002 # refers to the second step
Explicit data typing is seldom seen in the majority of YAML documents since YAML autodetects simple types. Data types can be divided into three categories: core, defined, and user-defined. Core are ones expected to exist in any parser (e.g. floats, ints, strings, lists, maps, ...). Many more advanced data types, such as binary data, are defined in the YAML specification but not supported in all implementations. Finally YAML defines a way to extend the data type definitions locally to accommodate user-defined classes, structures or primitives (e.g. quad-precision floats).

YAML autodetects the datatype of the entity, but sometimes one wants to cast the datatype explicitly. The most common situation is where a single-word string that looks like a number, Boolean or tag requires disambiguation by surrounding it with quotes or using an explicit datatype tag.
---
a: 123 # an integer
b: &quot;123&quot; # a string, disambiguated by quotes
c: 123.0 # a float
d: !!float 123 # also a float via explicit data type prefixed by (!!)
e: !!str 123 # a string, disambiguated by explicit type
f: !!str Yes # a string via explicit type
g: Yes # a Boolean True (yaml1.1), string &quot;Yes&quot; (yaml1.2)
h: Yes we have No bananas # a string, &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; disambiguated by context.
Not every implementation of YAML has every specification-defined data type. These built-in types use a double-exclamation sigil prefix (). Particularly interesting ones not shown here are sets, ordered maps, timestamps, and hexadecimal. Here is an example of base64-encoded binary data.

Many implementations of YAML can support user-defined data types for object serialization. Local data types are not universal data types but are defined in the application using the YAML parser library. Local data types use a single exclamation mark ().

Data-structure hierarchy is maintained by outline indentation.

Notice that strings do not require enclosure in quotation marks. The specific number of spaces in the indentation is unimportant as long as parallel elements have the same left justification and the hierarchically nested elements are indented further. This sample document defines an associative array with 7 top level keys: one of the keys, &quot;items&quot;, contains a 2-element list, each element of which is itself an associative array with differing keys. Relational data and redundancy removal are displayed: the &quot;ship-to&quot; associative array content is copied from the &quot;bill-to&quot; associative array&#x27;s content as indicated by the anchor () and reference () labels. Optional blank lines can be added for readability. Multiple documents can exist in a single file/stream and are separated by . An optional can be used at the end of a file (useful for signaling an end in streamed communications without closing the pipe).

==Features==

===Indented delimiting===

Because YAML primarily relies on outline indentation for structure, it is especially resistant to delimiter collision. YAML&#x27;s insensitivity to quotation marks and braces in scalar values means one may embed XML, JSON or even YAML documents inside a YAML document by simply indenting it in a block literal (using codice_2 or ):
---
example: &gt;
 HTML goes into YAML without modification

 &lt;blockquote style=&quot;font: italic 1em serif&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&quot;Three is always greater than two,
 even for large values of two&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;--Author Unknown&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

YAML may be placed in JSON by quoting and escaping all interior quotation marks. YAML may be placed in XML by escaping reserved characters (, , , , ) and converting whitespace, or by placing it in a CDATA section.

===Non-hierarchical data models===
Unlike JSON, which can only represent data in a hierarchical model with each child node having a single parent, YAML also offers a simple relational scheme that allows repeats of identical data to be referenced from two or more points in the tree rather than entered redundantly at those points. This is similar to the facility IDREF built into XML. The YAML parser then expands these references into the fully populated data structures they imply when read in, so whatever program is using the parser does not have to be aware of a relational encoding model, unlike XML processors, which do not expand references. This expansion can enhance readability while reducing data entry errors in configuration files or processing protocols where many parameters remain the same in a sequential series of records while only a few vary. An example being that &quot;ship-to&quot; and &quot;bill-to&quot; records in an invoice are nearly always the same data.

===Practical considerations===

YAML is line-oriented and thus it is often simple to convert the unstructured output of existing programs into YAML format while having them retain much of the look of the original document. Because there are no closing tags, braces, or quotation marks to balance, it is generally easy to generate well-formed YAML directly from distributed print statements within unsophisticated programs. Likewise, the whitespace delimiters facilitate quick-and-dirty filtering of YAML files using the line-oriented commands in grep, AWK, Perl, Ruby, and Python.

In particular, unlike markup languages, chunks of consecutive YAML lines tend to be well-formed YAML documents themselves. This makes it very easy to write parsers that do not have to process a document in its entirety (e.g. balancing opening and closing tags and navigating quoted and escaped characters) before they begin extracting specific records within. This property is particularly expedient when iterating in a single, stateless pass, over records in a file whose entire data structure is too large to hold in memory, or for which reconstituting the entire structure to extract one item would be prohibitively expensive.

Counterintuitively, although its indented delimiting might seem to complicate deeply nested hierarchies, YAML handles indents as small as a single space, and this may achieve better compression than markup languages. Additionally, extremely deep indentation can be avoided entirely by either: 1) reverting to &quot;inline style&quot; (i.e. JSON-like format) without the indentation; or 2) using relational anchors to unwind the hierarchy to a flat form that the YAML parser will transparently reconstitute into the full data structure.

===Security===

YAML is purely a data-representation language and thus has no executable commands. While validation and safe parsing is inherently possible in any data language, implementation is such a notorious pitfall that YAML&#x27;s lack of an associated command language may be a relative security benefit.

However, YAML allows language-specific tags so that arbitrary local objects can be created by a parser that supports those tags. Any YAML parser that allows sophisticated object instantiation to be executed opens the potential for an injection attack. Perl parsers that allow loading of objects of arbitrary classes create so-called &quot;blessed&quot; values. Using these values may trigger unexpected behavior, e.g. if the class uses overloaded operators. This may lead to execution of arbitrary Perl code.

The situation is similar for Python or Ruby parsers. According to the PyYAML documentation:
Note that the ability to construct an arbitrary Python object may be dangerous if you receive a YAML document from an untrusted source such as the Internet. The function limits this ability to simple Python objects like integers or lists. [...]

PyYAML allows you to construct a Python object of any type. Even instances of Python classes can be constructed using the tag.
===Data processing and representation===

The YAML specification identifies an &quot;instance document&quot; as a &quot;Presentation&quot; or &quot;character stream&quot;. The primary logical structures in a YAML instance document are scalars, sequences, and mappings. The YAML specification also indicates some basic constraints that apply to these primary logical structures. For example, according to the specification, mapping keys do not have an order. In every case where node order is significant, a sequence must be used.

Moreover, in defining conformance for YAML processors, the YAML specification defines two primary operations: &quot;dump&quot; and &quot;load&quot;. All YAML-compliant processors must provide &quot;at least&quot; one of these operations, and may optionally provide both. Finally, the YAML specification defines an &quot;information model&quot; or &quot;representation graph&quot;, which must be created during processing for both &quot;dump&quot; and &quot;load&quot; operations, although this representation need not be made available to the user through an API.

==Comparison with other serialization formats==

===Comparison with JSON ===
JSON syntax is a basis of YAML version 1.2, which was promulgated with the express purpose of bringing YAML &quot;into compliance with JSON as an official subset&quot;. Though prior versions of YAML were not strictly compatible, the discrepancies were rarely noticeable, and most JSON documents can be parsed by some YAML parsers such as Syck. This is because JSON&#x27;s semantic structure is equivalent to the optional &quot;inline-style&quot; of writing YAML. While extended hierarchies can be written in inline-style like JSON, this is not a recommended YAML style except when it aids clarity.

YAML has many additional features not present in JSON, including comments, extensible data types, relational anchors, strings without quotation marks, and mapping types preserving key order.

Due to the conciseness, JSON serialization and deserialization is much faster than YAML.

===Comparison with TOML===
TOML was designed to be an advancement of the .ini file format. YAML&#x27;s minimal use of indicator characters is compared favorably to TOML&#x27;s strict requirement of quotation marks and square brackets. YAML&#x27;s use of significant indentation has been contrasted with the dot notation of TOML&#x27;s key and table names to convey the same semantic structure. Opinions differ on which convention leads to more-readable configuration files.

===Comparison with XML===

YAML lacks the notion of tag attributes that are found in XML. Instead YAML has extensible type declarations (including class types for objects).

YAML itself does not have XML&#x27;s language-defined document schema descriptors that allow, for example, a document to self-validate. However, there are several externally defined schema descriptor languages for YAML (e.g. Doctrine, Kwalify and Rx) that fulfill that role. Moreover, the semantics provided by YAML&#x27;s language-defined type declarations in the YAML document itself frequently relaxes the need for a validator in simple, common situations. Additionally, YAXML, which represents YAML data structures in XML, allows XML schema importers and output mechanisms like XSLT to be applied to YAML.

Comparison of data-serialization formats provides a more comprehensive comparison of YAML with other serialization formats.

==Software (emitters and parsers)==

For fixed data structures, YAML files can simply be generated using &quot;print&quot; commands that write both the data and the YAML specific decoration. To dump varying, or complex, hierarchical data, however, a dedicated YAML &quot;emitter&quot; is preferable. Similarly, simple YAML files (e.g. key-value pairs) are readily parsed with regular expressions. For more complex, or varying, data structures, a formal YAML &quot;parser&quot; is recommended.

YAML emitters and parsers exist for many popular languages. Most of them are written in the native language itself. Some are language bindings of the C library &quot;libyaml&quot;; they may run faster. There used to be another C library, called &quot;Syck&quot;, written and orphaned by why the lucky stiff: it is unmaintained, there is no authoritative source bundle, and the web site has been hijacked. Hence the only recommendable C library is &quot;libyaml&quot;. It was originally developed by Kirill Simonov. In 2018, development was resumed by the new maintainers Ian Cordasco and Ingy döt Net.

C++ programmers have the choice between the C library &quot;libyaml&quot; and the C++ library &quot;libyaml-cpp&quot;. Both have completely independent code bases and completely different APIs. The library &quot;libyaml-cpp&quot; still has a major version number of 0, indicating that the API may change at any moment, as happened indeed after version 0.3. There is a grammar-focused implementation written in C#, with an aim on extensions for the nested elements.

Some implementations of YAML, such as Perl&#x27;s YAML.pm, will load an entire file (stream) and parse it &quot;en masse&quot;. Other implementations like PyYaml are lazy and iterate over the next document only upon request. For very large files in which one plans to handle the documents independently, instantiating the entire file before processing may be prohibitive. Thus in YAML.pm, occasionally one must chunk a file into documents and parse those individually. YAML makes this easy, since this simply requires splitting on the document end marker, which is defined as three periods at the start of a line followed by a whitespace (and possible a comment). This marker is forbidden in content.

==Criticism==
YAML has been criticized for its significant whitespace, confusing features, insecure defaults, and its complex and ambiguous specification:

* Configuration files can execute commands or load contents without the users realizing it.
* Editing large YAML files is difficult, as indentation errors can go unnoticed.
* Type autodetection is a source of errors. For example, unquoted and are converted to Booleans; software version numbers might be converted to floats.
* Truncated files are often interpreted as valid YAML due to the absence of terminators.
* The complexity of the standard led to inconsistent implementations and making the language non-portable.

The perceived flaws and complexity of YAML has led to the emergence of stricter alternatives such as StrictYAML and NestedText.

<text>Jeolla Province (, ) was one of the historical Eight Provinces of Korea during the Kingdom of Joseon in southwestern Korea. It consisted of the modern South Korean provinces of North Jeolla, South Jeolla and Gwangju Metropolitan City as well as Jeju Province. The provincial capital was Jeonju, the current capital of North Jeolla. The entire inland region was called Honam (), which is still commonly used today.

Jeolla-do, including North and South Jeolla,was the first province/state out of the Eight Provinces system to have its 1000th year anniversary in 2018, as the name &#x27;Jeolla-do&#x27; was established in 1018, during Hyeonjong of Goryeo&#x27;s 9th year in power.

The population of Jeolla-do is 4,973,834 as of January 2024.

==History==

===Samhan and Samguk===

During the Samhan era of Korean history, the area of Jeolla was controlled by the Mahan confederacy and the Tamna kingdom on Jeju. Fifteen of the 45 Korean tribes had their bases in this region. When Baekje overtook Mahan by the 5th century, the Three Kingdoms era began and the region became part of southern Baekje. Jungbang was the center of the province during this period.

===Unified Silla===
When Silla conquered Baekje with the help of Tang China in 660, it became a territory of Later Silla during the 16th year of the reign of Munmu of Silla. Silla reorganized this territory into nine () and five (), three of the belonging to the former Baekje. The northern territory of former Baekje, Ung (&quot;Ungju&quot;; 熊州), corresponds to modern-day South Chungcheong Province.

The middle area consisted of Wansan (完山州) and Namwon, which correspond to modern-day North Jeolla. Wansan was later renamed Jeonju. The southern area consisted of Mujin (), which was renamed Mu (武州) in 757, the 16th year of the reign of Gyeongdeok of Silla. Mu consisted of one and 43 , and corresponds to modern-day South Jeolla.

===Goryeo dynasty===
In 983, during the second year of the reign of Seongjong of Goryeo, the country was reorganized into 12 . Jeonju became Jeonju-mok (全州牧), while Muju was split into the two of Naju and Seungju. In 995, King Seongjong again reorganized the country, this time into 10 (). Jeonju-mok was renamed Gangnam-do () while Naju and Seungju were reunited and renamed Haeyang-do ().

In 1018, during the 9th year of the reign of Hyeonjong of Goryeo, the country was again reorganized into 5 , and the provinces of Gangnam and Haeyang were merged to form the province of Jeollaju (全羅州道). The name derived from the names of the principal cities of Jeonju (全州) and Naju (羅州). (The difference between &quot;na-&quot; and &quot;-la&quot; is due to the (initial sound rule of modern Korean). This was the first time the area currently known as Jeolla was united under one administrative division, and it would remain this way for nearly eight centuries.

===Joseon: 1392–1910===
In 1413, during 13th year of the reign of Taejong of Joseon, the territories were once again reorganized into 8 &quot;&quot;. This is the era of the historic Eight Provinces. Jeollaju-do was variously known as Gwangnam, Jeongwang, and Jeonnam, but the original name persisted, and was eventually shortened to simply Jeolla-do (全羅道). 

The Donghak Peasant Revolution of 1894–1895 began in Jeolla-do, which was a peasant revolt fueled by the fervor of the believed coming of a local messiah and protests over Seoul&#x27;s high taxes on rice and the increasing number of Japanese traders in Joseon. There was anti-Japanese sentiment due to the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598).

On May 26, 1895, Gojong of Korea replaced the 8 system with a 23 &quot;bu&quot; district system and Jeolla was replaced by the districts of Jeonju () in the northwest, Naju () in the southwest, Namwon () in the east, and Jeju () on Jeju-do.

On August 4, 1896, Emperor Gojong issued Royal Order 36, repealing the district system and restoring the province system. Jeolla was divided north-south into North Jeolla Province and South Jeolla Province. Also divided were Chungcheong Province, Gyeongsang Province, Hamgyong Province and Pyongan Province, bringing the total to 13 provinces.

===Republic of Korea: 1948–present===
North Jeolla Province consisted of the Jeonju and northern Namwon districts, while South Jeolla Province consisted of the southern Namwon districts, Naju district, and Jeju island. Jeonju was retained as the capital of North Jeolla, with Gwangju being made the capital of South Jeolla. The capital of South Jeolla was later moved to Namak in 2005, and Gwangju was designated a Special City.

==Geography==
Jeolla Province was bounded on the north by Chungcheong Province, on the east by Gyeongsang Province, on the south by the East China Sea, and on the west by the Yellow Sea. The region is bordered on the east by the Sobaek Mountains and is drained by the Yeongsan, Seomjin and Mangyeong rivers. The largest city in the region is Gwangju. Apart from Jeonju and Naju, other cities of note include Iksan (formerly Iri), Gunsan, Mokpo, Namwon, Suncheon, and Yeosu.

<text>In mathematics, a Ramsey cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number introduced by and named after Frank P. Ramsey, whose theorem, called Ramsey&#x27;s theorem establishes that ω enjoys a certain property that Ramsey cardinals generalize to the uncountable case.

Let [&quot;κ&quot;]&lt;ω denote the set of all finite subsets of &quot;κ&quot;. A cardinal number &quot;κ&quot; is called Ramsey if, for every function

:&quot;f&quot;: [&quot;κ&quot;]&lt;ω → {0, 1}

there is a set &quot;A&quot; of cardinality &quot;κ&quot; that is homogeneous for &quot;f&quot;. That is, for every &quot;n&quot;, the function &quot;f&quot; is constant on the subsets of cardinality &quot;n&quot; from &quot;A&quot;. A cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is called ineffably Ramsey if &quot;A&quot; can be chosen to be a stationary subset of &quot;κ&quot;. A cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is called virtually Ramsey if for every function

:&quot;f&quot;: [&quot;κ&quot;]&lt;ω → {0, 1}

there is &quot;C&quot;, a closed and unbounded subset of &quot;κ&quot;, so that for every &quot;λ&quot; in &quot;C&quot; of uncountable cofinality, there is an unbounded subset of &quot;λ&quot; that is homogenous for &quot;f&quot;; slightly weaker is the notion of almost Ramsey where homogenous sets for &quot;f&quot; are required of order type &quot;λ&quot;, for every &quot;λ&quot; &lt; &quot;κ&quot;.

The existence of any of these kinds of Ramsey cardinal is sufficient to prove the existence of 0#, or indeed that every set with rank less than &quot;κ&quot; has a sharp. This in turn implies the falsity of the Axiom of Constructibility of Kurt Gödel.

Every measurable cardinal is a Ramsey cardinal, and every Ramsey cardinal is a Rowbottom cardinal.

A property intermediate in strength between Ramseyness and measurability is existence of a &quot;κ&quot;-complete normal non-principal ideal &quot;I&quot; on &quot;κ&quot; such that for every and for every function

:&quot;f&quot;: [&quot;κ&quot;]&lt;ω → {0, 1}

there is a set &quot;B&quot; ⊂ &quot;A&quot; not in &quot;I&quot; that is homogeneous for &quot;f&quot;. This is strictly stronger than &quot;κ&quot; being ineffably Ramsey.

A regular cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is Ramsey if and only if for any set &quot;A&quot; ⊂ &quot;κ&quot;, there is a transitive set &quot;M&quot; ⊨ ZFC− (i.e. ZFC without the axiom of powerset) of size &quot;κ&quot; with &quot;A&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;, and a nonprincipal ultrafilter &quot;U&quot; on the Boolean algebra &quot;P(κ) ∩ M&quot; such that:
* &quot;U&quot; is an &quot;M-ultrafilter:&quot; for any sequence ⟨&quot;Xβ&quot; : &quot;β &lt; κ&quot;⟩ ∈ &quot;M&quot; of members of &quot;U&quot;, the diagonal intersection Δ&quot;Xβ&quot; = {&quot;α &lt; κ&quot; : ∀&quot;β &lt; α&quot;(&quot;α&quot; ∈ &quot;Xβ&quot;)} ∈ &quot;U&quot;,
* &quot;U&quot; is &quot;weakly amenable:&quot; for any sequence ⟨&quot;Xβ&quot; : &quot;β &lt; κ&quot;⟩ ∈ &quot;M&quot; of subsets of &quot;κ&quot;, the set {&quot;β &lt; κ&quot; : &quot;Xβ&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;} ∈ &quot;M&quot;, and
* &quot;U&quot; is &quot;σ-complete:&quot; the intersection of any countable family of members of &quot;U&quot; is again in &quot;U&quot;.

<text>Honam (; literally &quot;south of the lake&quot;) is a region coinciding with the former Jeolla Province in what is now South Korea. Today, the term refers to Gwangju, South Jeolla Province, Jeju Province and Jeonbuk State. The name &quot;Jeonla-do&quot; is used in the names of the Honam railway line and Honam Expressway, which are major transportation corridors connecting Seoul and Daejeon to the Honam region. The name is often used to refer to people residing in the region. There is also Honam University, which is located in Gwangju, the biggest city in Honam.

<doc id="326536" wikidata="Q2255303" url="?curid=326536" title="Get Fuzzy">
<text>Get Fuzzy is an American gag-a-day comic strip written and drawn by Darby Conley. It features Boston advertising executive Rob Wilco and his two anthropomorphic pets, a dog, Satchel Pooch, and a cat, Bucky Katt. While there have been no new comics produced since 2019, the reruns continue to appear in newspapers.

The strip&#x27;s humor comes from the conflict between Bucky&#x27;s and Satchel&#x27;s personalities, which are extreme stereotypes of cats and dogs. Sweet, trusting, naïve Satchel is routinely subjected to the exploitation of cruel, self-centered Bucky, who is always torturing the poor canine. Rob, the middleman, is often frazzled from dealing with them, or more specifically, from dealing with Bucky&#x27;s destructive nature and overall nastiness. The three characters live in an apartment on Boston&#x27;s Longwood Avenue. &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot; often eschews the traditional &quot;setup-punchline&quot; format of most funnies, instead building on absurd dialog between characters.

The unusual title of the strip comes from a concert poster that Conley once created for his brother&#x27;s band, the Fuzzy Sprouts. &quot;Life&#x27;s too short to be cool,&quot; the poster read, &quot;Get Fuzzy.&quot;

==Publication history==
&quot;Get Fuzzy&quot; was first published on September 6, 1999 by United Feature Syndicate (now Andrews McMeel Syndication). Initially appearing in 75 newspapers nationally, the strip quickly gained popularity. It currently appears in some 400 newspapers worldwide.

===Reruns===
In 2011, &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot; began to incorporate reprinted strips into its daily rotation, initially alternating from week to week with new strips. The reruns became more frequent, and by November 2013, the daily strips consisted entirely of strips from previous years. New Sunday strips continued appearing sporadically until February 2019.

The lack of new content caused a decline in the popularity of &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot;, and in some cases reader feedback polls were conducted as to whether to keep the strip. One of these was conducted by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in October 2013; the paper cited the reruns as the reason for the strip&#x27;s lack of support and announced that they would be dropping it from the paper. The &quot;Seattle Times&quot;, which stopped carrying &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot; on March 3, 2014, said their reasoning was &quot;because the creator is no longer producing new installments.&quot;

==Characters==

===Main characters===
Rob Wilco is the &quot;owner&quot; of Satchel and Bucky and serves as the guy sandwiched between Satchel&#x27;s goofy naïveté and Bucky&#x27;s cynical hostility. In the &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot; universe, virtually all animals talk, a situation that no one seems to find odd. Rob is portrayed as a bit of an everyman: a mediocre performer in a job he dislikes, not successful romantically, and an all-around relatively quiet guy with a poor haircut and chronic lower back pain. His passions, which often border on obsessions, include sports (particularly the Boston Red Sox and the New Zealand All Blacks), video games, books, and guitarist Leo Kottke. He is also a strict vegetarian, due to what he feels are too cruel methods of killing the animals. The character was named for two of Conley&#x27;s classmates at South-Doyle High School (then &#x27;Doyle&#x27;) in Knoxville, Tennessee who were named &quot;Rob&quot;.

Bucky B. Katt is Rob&#x27;s self-absorbed and cynical Siamese cat. His ears are nearly always drawn laid back flat on his head, a feline sign of defiance, aggressiveness, and he is missing an upper canine tooth. The Humane Society found Bucky huddled on a trash can, while the cat was only a few weeks old, in Hackensack, New Jersey, later to be adopted by Rob. While Bucky&#x27;s father has never been mentioned, Bucky gave his mother&#x27;s maiden name on a credit card application as &quot;Tricky Woo,&quot; an allusion to the ludicrously pampered (but in fact good-natured) pet dog of that name in James Herriot&#x27;s stories of his experiences as a vet. Bucky lives in a dresser located in the hall closet of Rob&#x27;s apartment because he refuses to share a room with Satchel. On most outdoor excursions, when Rob is present, Bucky is carried in a strap-on &quot;Bundle-O-Joy&quot; baby carrier, referenced as a way of keeping the cat out of trouble. Bucky&#x27;s aggression is often directed at Satchel, although his attempts usually fail as Satchel is too kind or unaware to play along with Bucky&#x27;s often ignorant dabs at sarcasm. Three obsessions dominate Bucky&#x27;s life: his hatred of a neighborhood ferret named Fungo Squiggly; his desire to stop the &quot;monkey invasion&quot;; and wanting to film a movie or TV show about himself.

Bucky owns a miniature teddy bear named &quot;Smacky&quot;, obtained by his refusing to exchange toys with Satchel at a &quot;McDoodles&quot; restaurant even though each had the toy the other wanted. It is one of the few objects to which he shows affection. As Christmas gifts, Bucky received two other bears which he named &quot;Cracker&quot; and &quot;Punk&quot;, but they do not appear as often as Smacky. Bucky also owns a rag doll named &quot;Ms. Pretty&quot;, similar to Barbie. Bucky claims to be a fan of the &quot;Yankers&quot;, even wearing a Yankees cap throughout the series, although it appears more to be an opportunity to annoy Rob because he wouldn&#x27;t let him wear his Boston Red Sox baseball cap (he calls it the &quot;&#x27;B&#x27; is for &#x27;Bucky&#x27; hat&quot;) than anything else. Bucky identifies as Republican as shown in strips dated July 22, 2007 and September 12, 2008 among others. Bucky has been shown to hold extremely reactionary political viewpoints throughout the strip, but these may not stem from actual convictions as much as a desire to antagonize Rob and Satchel, both tolerant in their views. Bucky is also frequently shown to have francophobic and anti-Quebec sentiments. He regularly says words like frog and canuck, although these (like his politics and support of the Yankees) appear to stem from the desire to antagonize Satchel for his background, rather than racism or nativism.

For all his aggressiveness, Bucky is a part of the family. When he is absorbed in some scheme, Rob and Satchel are his preferred audience; when he is not, he does take an interest in their problems, usually looking for preposterous solutions and eager to take credit for any positive development.

Satchel Pooch is Rob&#x27;s overweight, naïve, and easily amused dog. His father, named Copernicus, a Labrador Retriever and retired guide dog, and his mother, a Shar Pei, live in Chéticamp, Nova Scotia. It is suggested by Rob&#x27;s friend Joe Doman, that he is named after the Baseball Hall of Fame player Satchel Paige. Satchel is kind, gentle, and sympathetic. These traits, coupled with his naïveté and gullibility, make him a natural target for the scheming Bucky. Satchel&#x27;s personality serves as foil to that of Bucky&#x27;s: easy to please, optimistic to the extreme, having little more common sense than Bucky, and perfectly content to peacefully coexist with everyone. He is good friends with Bucky&#x27;s nemesis, Fungo Squiggly, much to Bucky&#x27;s dismay.

True to his character, Satchel takes a neutral position in the ongoing Major League Baseball feud between professed New York Yankees fan Bucky and rabid Boston Red Sox fan Rob. Satchel occasionally expresses support for the Chicago Cubs-although he once was punished by being forced to wear a Cubs hat, dubbed the &quot;hat of shame&quot; in reference to the team&#x27;s long record of futility. Satchel is also proud of his Canadian and European heritage, taking the time to watch Queen Elizabeth II whenever the royal figure is on television. Satchel holds to a very liberal political viewpoint and is an animal rights supporter; occasionally asking Rob for money to donate to PETA or Greenpeace. Although Satchel cannot tell time, he wears a watch that he calls &quot;Handy&quot;.

===Secondary characters===

Joe Doman, Rob&#x27;s friend and co-worker. One of the few people who gets along reasonably well with Bucky and has pet-sat Bucky and Satchel a few times. Although Joe was frequently seen in the strips early years, this has decreased since taking a job in France. Joe is also a fan of rugby, having worn a jersey of the Scottish national team on a golf outing.

Francis Wilco, Rob&#x27;s father. A retired firefighter and former member of the United States Marine Corps. He reluctantly pet-sits Bucky and Satchel from time to time, has thinning hair, and is usually pictured with a cigarette dangling from his mouth.

Fungo Squiggly, the pet ferret of the neighboring Garcia family, who is Satchel&#x27;s friend and Bucky&#x27;s rival. Fungo does not have any audible speaking lines throughout the entire strip, but is able to communicate by writing out his thoughts (although Satchel can apparently understand ferret-speak). Fungo and Bucky take the impetus given by their rivalry as a chance to keep their hatred for each other going strong by setting traps for each other or playing tricks, such as Bucky&#x27;s challenging Fungo to a duel or Fungo&#x27;s stealing Bucky&#x27;s closet space. The exact motive for Bucky&#x27;s hatred of Fungo is unexplained, although it is possible that Bucky may mistake Fungo for some sort of rodent, as Bucky has referred to him as a &quot;rat&quot; or &quot;rodent&quot; at various times.

Chubby Huggs, a portly, interminably cheerful cat who believes positive reinforcement (mostly through hugging) solves all problems. Rob refers to him as the Dalai Lama of cats because of his peacemaking abilities. Once Chubby is locked in his hug position, he is unable to move for 10 minutes—a fact Rob used against him by tricking Chubby into hugging a teddy bear tightly so Satchel could carry him home. He once had a &quot;little mouse friend&quot; named Fowly Mouse who hated him and was vicious toward him, even though Chubby would take the threats as words of kindness, à la Ignatz Mouse and Krazy Kat.

Mac Manc McManx, Bucky&#x27;s cousin from Manchester, England. Mac speaks in British slang and is an ardent supporter of Manchester City Football Club. Mac&#x27;s father arrived in England during the First Gulf War from a place Mac only remembers being called &quot;Otis&quot;, so Rob tells Bucky that his family is from Massachusetts, to which Bucky replies, &quot;Blast! I&#x27;m a filthy communist!!!&quot;. Mac&#x27;s mother is from Hartlepool. Mac spent three and a half years at Rob&#x27;s apartment and has come back and forth since that time. It is implied that Rob originally let Mac stay at the apartment since he and Satchel never came up with an effective way of getting Mac to leave.

Foodar is a Canadian cat with a radar-like-seventh sense (according to Bucky all cats have six senses, the sixth being knowing which humans are afraid of them or dislike them so they can sit on their laps) that allows him to detect food at great distances (though he doesn&#x27;t bother detecting fruit or vegetables). His name is a portmanteau of &#x27;food&#x27; and &#x27;radar&#x27;.

Oreo is Satchel&#x27;s friend and love interest from his puppy days, but over the years she seems to have lost interest in him. She has the fur patterns of a Border Collie, has black and white fur, and wears a collar with a heart-shaped medallion.

Ira Chihuahua is a generally irritable Chihuahua who first appeared in Satchel&#x27;s dog conference. Ira prefers to go by his initial, I (as a play on the term &quot;ai chihuahua&quot;). He apparently likes to play in garbage and once contracted worms.

Shakespug is a small pug who wears a green dishwashing glove, and usually applies Shakespearean quotes to his speech. Shakespug also seems to understand Mac Manc McManx the best through his &quot;Brit-speak&quot;.

Motor is a dog who is Satchel&#x27;s friend. He is 3/4 Belgian Tervuren and gets offended when someone calls him a German Shepherd.

==Reception and awards==
Conley received the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Comic Strip Award in 2002 for his work on &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot;.

===Controversies===
Residents of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania reacted angrily to the October 30, 2003 strip, in which Pittsburgh—in an apparent inside joke—was made out as smelly. Conley said he received hate mail and even death threats in response. An apology promised by Conley took an unexpected form; his November 17 strip questioned why the Pittsburgh joke caused such an uproar, and noted that several protesters stated that New Jersey smelled worse than Pittsburgh. Satchel closes the strip by explaining that the original strip &quot;should have made it more clear that it was [nearby borough] Sewickley Heights that smells&quot;, coupled with a post-it note advertising an apology to Sewickley Heights.

In 2005, Bob Lobel, the longtime sports director for WBZ-TV in Boston, filed a libel suit against Darby Conley, United Feature Syndicate, and The Standard-Times of New Bedford, Massachusetts for implying that Lobel was intoxicated while on air; the lawsuit was settled out-of-court in November 2005.

<text>Leonard Edward Slatkin (born September 1, 1944) is an American conductor, author and composer.

==Early life and education==
Slatkin was born in Los Angeles to a Jewish musical family that came from areas of the Russian Empire now in Ukraine. His father, Felix Slatkin, was the violinist, conductor and founder of the Hollywood String Quartet, and his mother, Eleanor Aller, was the cellist with the quartet. His brother, Frederick, now a cellist, traced the family&#x27;s original name as Zlotkin, and adopted that form of the family surname for himself professionally. Frederick Zlotkin has spoken of the family lineage as follows:

:: &quot;The Zlotkin/Slatkin lineage is Russian-Jewish. The first Zlotkin arrival to the US was Felix&#x27;s father, grandpa Chaim Peretz Zlotkin, who came to settle with relatives in St. Louis in 1904; he (or the clerk at Ellis Island) changed the name. He probably came from the town of Mogilev, from a shtetl (the Russians forced most Jews to live in villages outside of the major cities)...The Altschuler [Aller] side of the family is really rife with musicians. [My grandfather] Grisha&#x27;s uncle, Modest Altschuler, was a cellist (making me 4th generation) and he had quite a career. Among other things, he did the St. Petersburg premiere of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Souvenir de Florence&quot; Sextet. When he came to America he formed the Russian Symphony Orchestra (early 1900s).&quot;

Slatkin studied at Indiana University and Los Angeles City College before attending the Juilliard School, where he studied conducting under Jean Morel. He also studied with Walter Susskind at the Aspen Music Festival and School.

==Career==
Slatkin&#x27;s conducting debut was in 1966 when he became artistic director and conductor of the award-winning New York Youth Symphony, and in 1968 Walter Susskind named him the assistant conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. While in St. Louis, Slatkin hosted for three years a weekly KDNA radio station program called The Slatkin Project. He left St. Louis in 1977 to become music director of the New Orleans Symphony.

He led a series of Beethoven festivals with the San Francisco Symphony during the late 1970s and early 1980s. These annual concerts, held during June, included the orchestra&#x27;s final concert in San Francisco&#x27;s War Memorial Opera House in 1980, which featured a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s ninth symphony.

Slatkin returned to Saint Louis in 1979 as music director of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. The national profile of the orchestra increased notably under his tenure, and the SLSO became one of the most acclaimed orchestras in the country. The ensemble toured and recorded frequently and impressed critics and audiences alike with its fine musicianship and creative musical direction. In 1985, he recorded the first digital stereo version of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; with the SLSO. (This was also the first complete &quot;Nutcracker&quot; issued on compact disc.) Upon the conclusion of his tenure in 1996, Slatkin became the SLSO&#x27;s conductor laureate. His recorded work with that orchestra was represented on RCA Victor Red Seal, EMI, Vox Records, and Telarc. Slatkin became a devoted fan of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team during his tenure in St Louis and has retained his interest in the Cardinals since his departure from St Louis.

Slatkin was the director of the Blossom Festival of the Cleveland Orchestra from 1990 to 1999. Slatkin was music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. from 1996 to 2008. Noted for putting the &quot;national&quot; back in National Symphony with programs highlighting twentieth-century American works, Slatkin received both praise for improving the overall quality of the orchestra and criticism for under-rehearsal of the NSO. Slatkin was a guest conductor for the American Russian Young Artists Orchestra.

In 2000, Slatkin became the chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In 2001, he was only the second non-British person to conduct the Last Night of the Proms (the first had been an Australian, Sir Charles Mackerras). This performance occurred in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and included changes to the traditional second half of the concert, most notably a performance of the Barber Adagio for Strings in honor of the victims. He held this post until September 11, 2004, the 110th Last Night. There were reports of tension between Slatkin and the orchestra, whose secure finances were said to have &quot;fostered a culture of superiority and recalcitrance,&quot; as well as negative concert reviews, which contributed to his short tenure with the BBCSO. Previously in the UK, Slatkin was principal guest conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra from 1997 to 2000 and made a series of digital recordings for RCA with them, including the symphonies of Ralph Vaughan Williams. In 2004, the Los Angeles Philharmonic named him principal guest conductor at the Hollywood Bowl for a two-year period; he was subsequently given a third year in the position, with his tenure ending in September 2007. In 2005, he became the principal guest conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London.

In 2006, Slatkin was named the music advisor to the Nashville Symphony Orchestra. In that capacity, he conducted the inaugural concert of the Schermerhorn Symphony Center on September 9, 2006. In June 2007, Slatkin was announced as the next Principal Guest Conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and he assumed this post in 2008. On October 27, 2006, the Jacobs School of Music announced the appointment of Slatkin to the faculty at Indiana University as a part-time teacher of conducting and composition.

On October 7, 2007, Slatkin announced he had reached agreement on a three-year contract, followed by a two-year option, to become the new music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, beginning with the 2008–2009 subscription season. Slatkin stated that he would relocate to the Detroit area. His contract in Detroit called for 5 weeks of subscription concerts in the 2008–2009 season, and 13 weeks in the 2009–2010 season. Slatkin conducted his first concert as music director in Detroit in December 2008. In February 2010, the orchestra announced the extension of Slatkin&#x27;s contract as music director through the 2012–2013 season. This also included an announcement that Slatkin would take a salary reduction to help relieve the financial difficulties of the orchestra. In November 2011, the orchestra announced the extension of Slatkin&#x27;s Detroit contract through the 2015–2016 season. In December 2014, the DSO announced the extension of his contract through August 2017, when it then becomes year-to-year. Slatkin stated that the projected year-to-year part of the contract did not mean that he planned to leave, only that at his age &quot;it makes more sense to stay flexible.&quot; He also said, &quot;We&#x27;re in the fun part right now.&quot; In December 2015, the DSO announced an extension of Slatkin&#x27;s contract as music director through the 2017–2018 season, after which time he is scheduled to relinquish the music directorship of the orchestra and to become its first-ever music director laureate, holding the latter post at least through the 2019–2020 season. In the music director laureate role, he will program and conduct four weeks a season and advise on artistic and personnel matters. Slatkin is credited with having rebuilt the DSO after a six-month strike and elevating it as a pillar of civic pride through innovative live webcasts and engaging community programming.

Slatkin&#x27;s compositions include &quot;The Raven&quot; (1971) for narrator and orchestra after Edgar Allan Poe, and &quot;Kinah&quot; (2015), an elegy dedicated to the memory of his parents, which received its world premiere with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in December 2015. He published his debut book, &quot;Conducting Business: Unveiling the Mystery Behind the Maestro,&quot; in 2012. In addition to his earlier Saint Louis recordings for RCA and EMI, Slatkin has conducted several recordings for the Naxos label, including the first commercial recording of William Bolcom&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience,&quot; which received Grammy awards for Best Classical Album and Best Choral Performance.

On November 1, 2009, Slatkin suffered a heart attack while conducting in the Netherlands. In May 2010, the Orchestre National de Lyon announced the appointment of Slatkin as its music director, effective with the 2011–2012 season. With the ONL, he has recorded works by Saint-Saëns, Ravel, and Berlioz on the Naxos label. In April 2016, the ONL announced that Slatkin is to stand down as music director after the 2016–2017 season, and subsequently to take the title of &quot;Directeur musical honoraire&quot; of the ONL.

On May 4, 2019, a new radio program hosted by Slatkin, &quot;The Slatkin Shuffle&quot;, was announced. On April 1, 2020, it was opened up to national distribution via Public Radio Exchange.
