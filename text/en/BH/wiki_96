<text>James William Fox (born William Fox; 19 May 1939) is an English actor known for his work in film and television. Fox&#x27;s career began in the 1960s through roles in films such as &quot;The Servant&quot; and &quot;Performance&quot;. He is also known for his roles in &quot;A Passage to India&quot; in 1984 and &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; in 1993.

In the 1970s, Fox took a break from acting to focus on personal and spiritual matters, returning to acting in the early 1980s. Over time, he built a reputation for playing a variety of roles, including upper-class figures and more serious characters. He is a member of the Fox family of actors.

==Early life==
Fox was born on 19 May 1939 in London, the second son of theatrical agent Robin Fox and actress Angela Worthington. His elder brother is actor Edward Fox and his younger brother is film producer Robert Fox. His maternal grandfather was playwright Frederick Lonsdale. 

==Career==

===Early career===
Fox first appeared on film as eleven-year-old Toby Miniver in &quot;The Miniver Story&quot; in 1950. His early screen appearances, both in film and television, were made under his birth name, William Fox.

He appeared in the film &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962). Fox&#x27;s father purportedly attempted to forbid this, fearing his son would lose his job in the bank; nevertheless, Fox took the part.

In 1964, Fox won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles for &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963), working alongside Dirk Bogarde, Sarah Miles, and Wendy Craig.

On 16 June 1965, Ken Annakin&#x27;s period aviation film &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; was released. In this British period comedy film, Fox is featured among an international ensemble cast including Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles, Robert Morley, Terry-Thomas, Red Skelton, Benny Hill, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gert Fröbe and Alberto Sordi. Some of the other films he acted in during this time are &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965), &quot;The Chase&quot; (1966), &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967), &quot;Isadora&quot; (1968), and &quot;Performance&quot; (1970).

===Spiritual life and break from acting===
After finishing work on &quot;Performance&quot; (released 1970, but shot in 1968), Fox suspended his acting career. The film, which starred Fox and Mick Jagger, was deemed so outrageous (at the time) that critics at a preview screening walked out, with one film executive&#x27;s wife reportedly throwing up in the cinema.

In a 2008 interview, he said: &quot;It was just part of my journey...I think my journey was to spend a while away from acting. And I never lost contact with it – watching movies, reading about it ... so I didn&#x27;t feel I missed it.&quot;

He became an evangelical Christian, working with the Navigators and devoting himself to the ministry. During this time, the only film in which Fox appeared was &quot;No Longer Alone&quot; (1976), the story of Joan Winmill Brown, a suicidal woman who was led to faith in Jesus Christ by Ruth Bell Graham.

===Return to acting===
After an absence from acting of several years, in 1981 Fox appeared on television in the &quot;Play for Today&quot; &quot;Country&quot; by Trevor Griffiths, a comedy drama set against the 1945 UK parliamentary elections. On film he starred in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s &quot;Runners&quot; (1983), &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984), and &quot;Comrades&quot; (1986). He played Anthony Blunt in the BBC play by Alan Bennett, &quot;A Question of Attribution&quot; (1992). He also portrayed the character of Lord Holmes in &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992), as well as Colonel Ferguson in &quot;Farewell to the King&quot; (1989) and the Nazi-sympathising aristocrat Lord Darlington in &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993).

He has since appeared in the 2000 film &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;, the 2001 adaptation of &quot;The Lost World&quot; as Prof. Leo Summerlee, &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot – Death on the Nile&quot; (2004) as Colonel Race, and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005), playing Mr. Salt, Veruca Salt&#x27;s father. He appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;Shada&quot;, and in 2007, he guest-starred in the British television crime series &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;. He also appeared opposite his son Laurence Fox in &quot;Allegory of Love&quot;, an episode in the third series of &quot;Lewis&quot;. He was part of the cast of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009), as Sir Thomas, leading member of a freemason-like secret society.

In 2010, he filmed &quot;Cleanskin&quot;, a terrorist thriller directed by Hadi Hajaig, and in 2011 he played King George V in the Madonna written and directed film &quot;W.E.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;w/e&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, he played a lead role alongside Natalie Dormer, in the movie &quot;A Long Way From Home&quot;.

==Personal life==
Fox married Mary Elizabeth Piper in September 1973, with whom he has five children, including Laurence and Jack. Piper died at their home on 19 April 2020.

Through his daughter Lydia, his son-in-law is actor Richard Ayoade. His former daughter-in-law is actress Billie Piper, who was married to his son Laurence from 2007 to 2016.

<doc id="338378" wikidata="Q7210" url="?curid=338378" title="Emperor Gaozu of Han">
<text>Emperor Gaozu of Han (2561 June 195 BC), also known by his given name Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 to 195 BC. He is considered by traditional Chinese historiography to be one of the greatest emperors in history, credited with establishing the first Pax Sinica, one of China&#x27;s longest golden ages.

Liu Bang was among the few dynastic founders to have been born in a peasant family. He initially entered the Qin dynasty bureaucracy as a minor law enforcement officer in his home town in Pei County, within the conquered state of Chu. During the political chaos following the death of Qin Shi Huang, who had been the first emperor in Chinese history, Liu Bang renounced his civil service position and became a rebel leader, taking up arms against the Qin dynasty. He outmanoeuvred rival rebel leader Xiang Yu to invade the Qin heartland and forced the surrender of the Qin ruler Ziying in 206 BC.

After the fall of the Qin dynasty, Xiang Yu, as the &quot;de facto&quot; chief of the rebels, divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms, with Liu Bang forced to accept control of the poor and remote region of Bashu (present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi), and assuming the title &quot;King of Han&quot;. Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the Three Qins, starting the Chu–Han Contention, a civil war among various forces seeking to inherit the Qin dynasty&#x27;s former supremacy over China.

In 202 BC, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the Battle of Gaixia, unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and corvée labour, promoted Confucianism, and suppressed revolts by the rulers of vassal states not from his own clan, among many other actions. He also initiated the policy of &quot;heqin&quot;, a system of arranged marriages between nobles, to maintain peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu following the Han defeat at the Battle of Baideng in 200 BC. He died in 195 BC and was succeeded by his son Liu Ying.

==Birth and early life==
According to the Han dynasty&#x27;s imperial mythology, Liu Bang&#x27;s ancestors were the mythical Emperor Yao and the Yellow Emperor. Many ancient Chinese noble families claimed descent from the Yellow Emperor to justify their right to rule.

Liu Bang was born during the later years of the Warring States period; his parents are only remembered as &quot;Liu Taigong&quot; and &quot;Liu Ao&quot; (). His family was from Zhongyang () in the state of Chu. According to legend, Liu Bang was conceived after Liu Ao encountered a &quot;jiaolong&quot; during a rainstorm.

According to records, the young Liu was outspoken, charismatic, generous and forbearing, but showed little interest in education or work and frequently ran into trouble with the law; he was dependent on his brother for subsistence and his father called him a &quot;little rascal&quot;. Later, he became good friends with Zhang Er (), the magistrate of the nearby Waihuang County and former retainer of Lord Xinling. He lived with Zhang Er for several months until the latter went into hiding after the conquest of Chu by Qin.

When Liu returned to Pei County, his close friends at the county office, Xiao He and Cao Shen, often covered up his delinquent behaviour and helped him get an appointment as the local sheriff () of Sishui Village (). Liu also forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned a small reputation in the county. While performing corvée labour in the Qin capital at Xianyang, he witnessed Qin Shi Huang undertaking an inspection tour; the royal procession impressed him.

Liu&#x27;s wife, Lü Zhi, was the daughter of Lü Wen (), a wealthy and influential gentry from Shanfu County. After moving to Pei County, Lü held a feast for the local elite. Xiao He, who helped to collect gifts from the guests, declared that a seat inside the hall required gifts worth at least a thousand coins. Liu attended the feast without money, and made an offer of ten thousand coins which Xiao He realised was not serious. Nonetheless, Lü had Liu seated beside him based on appearance alone. Lü, further impressed by Liu in conversation, offered his daughter in marriage. Liu and Lü Zhi were married and had two children: Liu Ying and a daughter.

==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==

Liu was responsible for escorting a group of penal labourers to the construction site of Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s mausoleum at Mount Li. During the journey, some prisoners escaped; under Qin law, allowing prisoners to escape was punishable by death. Rather than face punishment, Liu freed the remaining prisoners, some of whom willingly acknowledged him as their leader and joined him on the run from the law. As outlaws, they took over an abandoned stronghold on Mount Mangdang. During this time, Liu secretly remained in contact with some old friends in Pei County, including Xiao He and Cao Shen.

According to the legend known as the &quot;Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent&quot; (), Liu&#x27;s ascension to rulership was prophesied after he became an outlaw. In the legend, his followers encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed some of them with its poisonous breath. That night, while he was drunk, Liu drew his sword and slew the serpent. The next morning, the outlaws encountered a crying old woman along the road. When they asked her why she was crying, she replied, &quot;My child, the White Emperor&#x27;s son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.&quot; After that, she mysteriously disappeared. As this legend spread, Liu&#x27;s reputation grew among his followers, who became convinced of his destiny.

In 209 BC, Chen Sheng and Wu Guang started the Dazexiang uprising to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion, and – acting on the advice of Xiao He and Cao Shen – invited Liu and his followers back to the county to support him; Fan Kuai, Liu&#x27;s brother-in-law, delivered the message to the outlaws at Mount Mangdang. However, the magistrate later changed his mind and rescinded the offer; he also ordered Xiao and Cao to be killed lest they open the gates for Liu, but they escaped and joined Liu. On Xiao&#x27;s advice, Liu wrote to his fellow commoners in Pei County, calling for them to rise up against the Qin dynasty. Copies of Liu&#x27;s call to action were then delivered by arrows fired into Pei County over the city walls. The people responded to Liu&#x27;s call by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back to Pei County. Now the leader of Pei County&#x27;s population, Liu became known as the Duke of Pei ().

In 208 BC, the Qin Empire faced rebellions that sought to restore the former six states conquered by the Qin during its wars of unification. In Wu County, a rebel group led by Xiang Liang installed Xiong Xin as King Huai II () of Chu. Liu led his followers to join that rebel group. After Xiang Liang was killed at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Yu – Xiang Liang&#x27;s nephew – and minister Song Yi to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao rebel group, which was under attack by Qin forces.

Liu Bang was made Marquis of Wu&#x27;an () and ordered to lead an army to attack the Guanzhong region, the heartland of the Qin dynasty. King Huai II also promised to make whoever entered Guanzhong first the King of Guanzhong. In 207 BC, Liu won the race against Xiang Yu and arrived at Xianyang, the capital of the Qin dynasty. Ziying, the last Qin emperor, surrendered to Liu without resistance. Liu&#x27;s occupation policies were informed by Fan Kuai (now his bodyguard) and his strategist Zhang Liang. Troops were forbidden from mistreating the population and looting. The harsh Qin laws were abolished; murder, robbery and burglary remained subject to strict punishments. Order was quickly restored in the city, and Liu won the respect of the Guanzhong population. Xiao He ordered the collection of all legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities for preservation.

== King of Han ==
===Feast at Swan Goose Gate===

Xiang Yu disliked losing the race to Guanzhong. Acting on the advice of his adviser Fan Zeng and Cao Wushang (), an informer from Liu&#x27;s camp, Xiang Yu planned to assassinate Liu under the pretext of inviting him to attend a banquet at Swan Goose Gate (; roughly present-day Hongmenbao Village, Lintong District, Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi). However, during the banquet, Xiang Yu was persuaded by his uncle Xiang Bo, who was also a close friend of Liu&#x27;s adviser Zhang Liang, not to order Liu&#x27;s assassination. Frustrated by the indecision, Fan Zeng ordered Xiang Yu&#x27;s cousin Xiang Zhuang to pretend to perform a sword dance and find a chance to assassinate Liu. Yet, Xiang Bo intervened by joining the dance and blocking Xiang Zhuang every time he thrust his sword towards Liu. Meanwhile, Zhang Liang slipped away and summoned Fan Kuai, who arrived at the banquet in full armour and gave a speech chastising Xiang Yu for attempting to assassinate Liu despite the achievements Liu had made in overthrowing the Qin dynasty. Embarrassed by Fan&#x27;s speech, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan for his bravery. Liu Bang then found a chance to escape Xiang Yu&#x27;s camp by pretending to go to the latrine, and then led his troops out of Xianyang towards the west. Shortly after that, Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, sacking the former Qin capital and burning the Epang Palace.

=== Enfeoffment at Hanzhong ===
After occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself &quot;Hegemon-King of Western Chu&quot; and split the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Although Liu Bang should rightfully become the King of Guanzhong per King Huai II&#x27;s earlier promise, Xiang Yu gave the Guanzhong region – divided into three kingdoms collectively known as the Three Qins – to three former Qin generals who had surrendered to him after the Battle of Julu. Liu Bang instead received the remote Bashu region (Sichuan Basin and upper Han River valley) as his kingdom, along with the title &quot;King of Han&quot; (). He awarded Zhang Liang some gold and precious stones, which Zhang Liang then used to bribe Xiang Yu&#x27;s uncle Xiang Bo to ask Xiang Yu to grant Liu Bang the territory of Hanzhong as well.

Liu and his men were then escorted across the Qinling Mountains by a detachment of Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces into Hanzhong. Acting on Zhang Liang&#x27;s advice, Liu destroyed the gallery roads leading into the Bashu region for strategic reasons: hinder future attacks from Xiang Yu, and make Xiang Yu believe that he had no intention of leaving Bashu after settling there.

== Chu-Han contention ==

From 206 to 202 BC, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle – historically known as the Chu–Han Contention – for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms.

===Conquest of the Three Qin===
Liu Bang&#x27;s migration to Hanzhong was far from pleasant. His followers were mostly from the Wu and Chu flatland regions so they could not adapt well to the mountainous terrain in Bashu. Moreover, there were many deserters every day. Liu also grew temperamental as he was very unhappy with his own predicament. One night, upon hearing a rumour that Xiao He had abandoned him, Liu almost had a nervous breakdown. When Xiao returned the following morning, Liu confronted him and demanded an explanation. Xiao revealed that he had left in a hurry after learning that Han Xin had deserted. Among all the deserters, Xiao was convinced that Liu could not afford to lose a talent like Han Xin, so that was why he had chosen to go after Han Xin only, and bring him back. Xiao then introduced Liu to Han Xin, who laid out his strategic plan to conquer the states. Impressed and convinced, Liu formally appointed Han Xin as a general of his army.

Meanwhile, Xiang Yu&#x27;s overbearing and arbitrary assignment of the Eighteen Kingdoms had caused much resentment among the former rebel leaders. Merely four months after Liu left for Bashu, a rebellion broke out in the Qi territories in late 206 BC, prompting Xiang Yu to lead his troops to suppress the revolt. On Han Xin&#x27;s advice, Liu sent his men to pretend to rebuild the gallery roads while secretly dispatching Han Xin with an army to attack the Three Qins via another route through Chencang. Han Xin took Zhang Han, one of the rulers of the Three Qins, by surprise and defeated him in battle. After that, the other two rulers decided to surrender to Liu. By August or September 205 BC, the Three Qins and the Guanzhong region had come under Liu&#x27;s control.

===Defeat at Pengcheng===
While Xiang Yu was busy suppressing the rebellion in the Qi lands, Liu gathered an army of 560,000 from the Bashu and Guanzhong regions and marched east to attack Western Chu. En route, he encountered Peng Yue, who joined his cause upon promise of a fiefdom in the Wei territories. Liu then ordered Peng Yue to lead his 30,000 men to pacify the surrounding areas, while he led his 560,000 troops into Pengcheng (; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu), the Western Chu capital, apparently unopposed. Due to lack of military discipline, Liu&#x27;s soldiers looted and pillaged Pengcheng after occupying it.

Upon learning of the fall of Pengcheng, Xiang Yu left the bulk of his forces to continue fighting in Qi, while he personally led 30,000 elite troops to retake his capital. He made camp about ten &quot;li&quot; near present-day Xiao County, Anhui, and attacked Pengcheng at dawn. By noon, Xiang Yu had routed Liu&#x27;s unprepared forces, driving them towards the nearby Gu and Si rivers, where over 100,000 men drowned or were killed by Chu soldiers. The remaining Han forces fled south to higher ground but were trapped by Chu forces near the Sui River, where another 100,000 men lost their lives and their corpses even blocked the river flow.

Liu escaped Pengcheng with only a dozen horsemen and headed to Pei County to fetch his family. Xiang Yu also sent troops to Pei County to capture Liu&#x27;s family, but they had all fled earlier. Xiang Yu&#x27;s men coerced a local into revealing the whereabouts of Liu&#x27;s family, and managed to capture Liu&#x27;s parents and Liu&#x27;s wife Lü Zhi. En route, Liu encountered his and Lü Zhi&#x27;s children – Princess Yuan and Liu Ying – and picked them up in his carriage, which was driven by Xiahou Ying. In his desperation to escape and lighten the load, Liu attempted thrice to push his children out of the carriage and abandon them. However, each time, Xiahou Ying stopped him and saved the children.

===Battle of Jingsuo===
After their disastrous defeat at Pengcheng, the strength of the Han forces decreased drastically. Many of the kings who had surrendered to Liu earlier defected to Xiang Yu&#x27;s side. Moreover, the states of Qi and Zhao, which were previously at war with Western Chu, also requested to make peace.

Upon reaching Xiayi (; east of present-day Dangshan County, Anhui), Liu regrouped his forces and prepared for a treat. When he arrived at Yu County, he sent an envoy to meet Ying Bu, the King of Jiujiang, to seek his support. Ying Bu, who had already been holding a grudge against Xiang Yu over the latter&#x27;s unfair assignment of the Eighteen Kingdoms, agreed to side with Liu. In response to Ying Bu&#x27;s betrayal, Xiang Yu sent Long Ju with an army to attack Jiujiang.

In 205 BC, Liu designated his son Liu Ying as crown prince and stationed him in Yueyang. Shortly after, Liu&#x27;s forces attacked and captured Feiqiu (; present-day Xingping, Shaanxi); Zhang Han, the King of Yong, committed suicide after his defeat.

In the south, Ying Bu failed to resist Long Ju&#x27;s attack so he gave up on Jiujiang and went to join Liu. Liu reorganised his forces – incorporating reinforcements from the Guanzhong region – and marched east to attack Xiang Yu again at Jing and Suo counties, both around present-day Xingyang, Henan. The battle was historically known as the Battle of Jingsuo. Liu emerged victorious and drove Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces eastward out of Xingyang.

===Battle of Chenggao and Treaty of Hong Canal===
In 204 BC, after sustaining losses from Chu attacks on his supply routes to Xingyang, Liu&#x27;s forces began to run short of supplies so Liu requested to make peace with Xiang Yu, agreeing to cede the lands east of Xingyang to Xiang Yu. Initially, Xiang Yu wanted to accept Liu&#x27;s offer but his adviser Fan Zeng urged him to reject it and use the opportunity to attack and destroy Liu. Xiang Yu thus changed his mind, pressed the attack on Xingyang, and besieged Liu inside the city. Liu heeded Chen Ping&#x27;s suggestion to use 40,000 catties of gold to bribe some of Xiang Yu&#x27;s men and get them to spread rumours that Fan Zeng had the intention of betraying Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu fell for the ruse and dismissed Fan Zeng.

Later that year, while Xiang Yu was away suppressing a rebellion in Qi territories, Liu seized the chance to attack and conquer Chenggao, defeating Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces led by Cao Jiu near the Si River. Liu then advanced further east until he reached Guangwu (), trapping Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces under Zhongli Mo in the area.

Following Han Xin&#x27;s victory against the allied forces of Chu and Qi at the Battle of Wei River in the north, the morale of the Chu forces fell and they started running short of supplies months later. Xiang Yu had no choice but to request to make peace with Liu, offering to release Liu&#x27;s family members whom he had captured earlier and had been holding hostage. Both sides agreed to a ceasefire and to divide China into west and east under the Han and Chu kingdoms along the Hong Canal, which runs through present-day Zhengzhou, Xingyang and Zhongmu in Henan; this agreement was also historically known as the Treaty of Hong Canal ().

===Battle of Gaixia===
In 203 BC, while Xiang Yu was retreating eastwards, Liu, acting on Zhang Liang and Chen Ping&#x27;s advice, renounced the peace agreement and prepared to attack Xiang Yu. He also sent messengers to meet Han Xin and Peng Yue, seeking their assistance to launch a coordinated attack on Xiang Yu from three directions. However, Han Xin and Peng Yue failed to mobilise their forces, so Liu ended up being defeated by Xiang Yu at Guling (; south of present-day Taikang County, Henan). After retreating and reinforcing his defences, Liu sent word to Han Xin and Peng Yue again, promising to award them fiefs and noble titles if they joined him in attacking Xiang Yu. They finally agreed this time.

Three months later in 202 BC, the combined forces of Liu, Han Xin and Peng Yue attacked Xiang Yu from three directions. Running low on supplies, Xiang Yu and his forces found themselves trapped in Gaixia (in present-day Anhui). There, Han Xin ordered his troops to sing folk songs from the Chu lands to evoke feelings of nostalgia among Xiang Yu&#x27;s men – who were mostly from Chu – and create the impression that many Chu soldiers had surrendered and joined the opposing side. The morale of Xiang Yu&#x27;s forces plummeted and many of his soldiers deserted. Xiang Yu attempted to fight his way out but encountered several ambushes along the way. Eventually, he was left with only 28 men when he reached the northern bank of the Wu River (; near present-day He County, Anhui), where he made a last stand and managed to slay over a hundred enemy soldiers before committing suicide by slitting his throat.

== Founding of the Han dynasty ==
In 202 BC, Liu became emperor with the support of his subjects even though he had expressed reluctance to take the throne. The dynasty was named &quot;Han&quot;, with the imperial capital at Luoyang (later moved to Chang&#x27;an). Liu Bang also instated his wife Lü Zhi as empress and their son Liu Ying as crown prince.

The following year, Liu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding on the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year as they could not agree on how to distribute the rewards. Liu felt that Xiao He had made the greatest contribution, so he made Xiao a marquis and gave him the largest amount of food stores. However, some of his other subjects expressed objections, saying that Xiao should not get the best reward since he had never fought on the frontline during the battles. Nonetheless, Liu countered by saying that Xiao should receive the highest credit as he was responsible for planning their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. Liu then named Cao Shen as the one who had made the greatest contribution in battle, and proceeded to reward him and the others accordingly.

==Reign==
===Reducing taxes and corvée===
Emperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in Guanzhong were exempted from taxes and corvée for 12 years, while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195 BC, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corvée; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the vassal kings to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.

===Emphasis on Confucianism===
In his early life, Liu disliked reading and scorned Confucianism. After becoming emperor, he still had a disdain for Confucianism until he met the scholar Lu Jia, who wrote the &quot;Xinyu&quot; (), a 12-volume book espousing the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as the Qin dynasty did previously). After completing each volume, Lu Jia read it to the emperor, who was deeply impressed.

Under Liu&#x27;s reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced Legalism, which had been prominent during the Qin dynasty, as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Jia, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin dynasty and reducing the severity of certain penalties. Sometime in January or February 195 BC, after suppressing Ying Bu&#x27;s rebellion, Liu passed by Confucius&#x27;s birthplace in Shandong, where he held a ceremony to pay tribute to the philosopher.

===Dispute over the succession===
In his later years, Liu favoured Consort Qi and neglected Lü Zhi. He felt that Liu Ying, his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler, so he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, Liu Ruyi, who was born to Consort Qi. Feeling worried that her son might lose his status as crown prince, Lü Zhi sought the help of Zhang Liang, who recommended four reclusive wise men, the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang, to speak up for Liu Ying.

In 195 BC, as Liu&#x27;s health started worsening, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhang Liang initially attempted to dissuade the emperor from doing so, but the emperor ignored him so he retired, claiming that he was ill. Shusun Tong and Zhou Chang () also strongly objected to the idea of changing the crown prince. Zhou Chang even said, &quot;I am not good in talking, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won&#x27;t follow your orders any more.&quot; As Zhou Chang spoke with a stutter, Liu found it rather amusing and he laughed. After that, much to Liu&#x27;s surprise, the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang showed up in his court; they had previously declined to serve in his government when he invited them to. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as crown prince. The emperor was so pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support, so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.

===Military campaigns===

After the Han dynasty was established, Liu enfeoffed various princes and vassal kings and awarded them each a territory in exchange for their allegiance and assistance in governing the empire. Among them were seven vassal kings who were not related to Liu&#x27;s clan: Zang Tu, the King of Yan; Han Xin, the King of Hán; Han Xin, the King of Chu; Peng Yue, the King of Liang; Ying Bu, the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; Wu Rui, the King of Changsha. As time passed, Liu became increasingly distrustful of the vassal kings, feeling worried that they might turn against him since they had no blood ties with him after all. Han Xin and Peng Yue were falsely accused of treason, and arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu started rebellions but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.

The Xiongnu to the north had posed a threat since the Qin dynasty. Qin Shi Huang had sent the general Meng Tian to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire&#x27;s northern border and the construction of the Great Wall to repel the invaders. Meng Tian had achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201 BC, one of the vassal kings, Hán Xin (King of Hán), defected to the Xiongnu leader, Modu. In the following year, Liu personally led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy during the Battle of Baideng. Acting on Chen Ping&#x27;s advice, he bribed Modu&#x27;s wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Liu Bang, acting on advice from Liu Jing (), initiated the policy of &quot;heqin&quot;, which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.

=== Jiru ===
Liu Bang was recorded to have had a male lover known as Jiru, who was said to have easier access to the emperor than the emperor&#x27;s other subjects.

==Death==
Liu was wounded in battle by a stray arrow while suppressing Ying Bu&#x27;s rebellion and became seriously ill. He remained in his inner chambers for a long time and ordered his guards to deny entry to anyone who wanted to visit him. After several days, Liu&#x27;s brother-in-law Fan Kuai barged in, followed closely by the emperor&#x27;s other subjects. They saw the emperor lying in bed, attended to by a eunuch. Fan Kuai said, &quot;How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten about what happened with Zhao Gao?&quot; The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.

Liu&#x27;s health deteriorated so the empress hired a famous physician to heal him. When Liu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured. However, the emperor was displeased, scolding the physician, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it Heaven&#x27;s will that I managed to conquer this empire despite being of humble origin and armed with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if Bian Que were here!&quot; He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that Cao Shen could succeed Xiao He as the chancellor after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling () could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so Chen Ping could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named Zhou Bo as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (), Chang&#x27;an, on 1 June 195 BC and was succeeded by his son Liu Ying.

== Song of the Great Wind ==
The &quot;Song of the Great Wind&quot; is a song composed by Liu Bang in 195 BC when he visited his hometown in Pei County after suppressing Ying Bu&#x27;s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him. After some drinks, Liu Bang played the guqin and sang the &quot;Song of the Great Wind&quot; ().

<text>Dominion was a national chain of supermarkets in Canada, which was known as the Dominion of Canada when the chain was founded. The chain was founded in 1919 in Ontario and was later acquired by the Argus Corporation. It was broken up in the mid-1980s, with key locations and the rights to the brand sold to The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (A&amp;P), which restricted the chain to the Greater Toronto Area. Stores elsewhere in Ontario were converted to the A&amp;P banner, and others were sold to third parties. A&amp;P&#x27;s Canadian division was later acquired by Metro Inc., which rebranded the remaining Dominion stores to its namesake banner in 2008.

==History==
Dominion started from one Toronto store on May 23, 1919. The store was founded by American businessmen Robert Jackson of New Hampshire and William J. Pentland of Connecticut. Pentland was manager of A&amp;P stores in Connecticut and was hired by Jackson. By the end of 1919, they had a 20-store chain of which 18 were acquired from rival Loblaws. A year later, they had 61 stores. In 1929, Dominion tried to acquire a stake in Loblaws, but the stock market crash ended the growth. During the Depression, Dominion lost both founders: Jackson went bankrupt and Pentland was killed in an auto accident in 1933.

Dominion&#x27;s leadership was not resolved until 1939, when J. William Horsey became president. He in turn sold Dominion Stores to Argus Corporation. Smaller stores were consolidated from 574 to 195 by 1954. In the 1950s, Dominion began to build large stores with airy ceilings and large glass fronts. The chain also expanded beyond Toronto to other parts of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Atlantic Canada.

=== Breakup ===

In 1978, Conrad Black took control of the Argus Corporation. Moving the Dominion holdings into the Hollinger Inc. portion of Argus, Dominion was stripped of cash from the daily flow. 

A&amp;P&#x27;s Canadian division, A&amp;P Canada, acquired 92 of Dominion&#x27;s prime locations in Ontario, as well as a head office, warehouses, and rights to the Dominion name from Hollinger in 1985, the final year of Black&#x27;s sell off of virtually all previous holdings of Argus Corporation. The chain&#x27;s remaining assets were sold piecemeal over the next two years. 

In northwestern Ontario, Safeway acquired at least two stores in Thunder Bay. (Safeway&#x27;s presence in Thunder Bay prevents Metro from offering Air Miles at its Thunder Bay locations.)

In Western Canada, Dominion stores were closed, leaving many suburban shopping malls scrambling to fill large, now-vacant sections. This event, coupled with the subsequent collapse of several department store chains, sparked a wave of mall renovations in many parts of the country. Alberta stores were acquired by Safeway in the late 1960s.

Much of the remainder of the chain in eastern and central Canada was ultimately acquired by Loblaw Companies, through several unrelated transactions:

* Ontario: The Mr. Grocer franchise banner of 58 stores, consisting mostly of former Dominion stores converted prior to the breakup in an attempt to change them to non-union operation, were sold for $40 million to Loblaw, which soon phased out the brand and signage.
* Newfoundland: Dominion stores in Newfoundland were sold to local owners, who then resold them to Loblaw in 1995. The Newfoundland locations are the only ones to continue under the Dominion banner; see Dominion Stores.
* New Brunswick: Shortly after the A&amp;P acquisition, these stores were sold to Food Group Inc., which operated them under the Village banner until Food Group was sold to Loblaw and merged into its Atlantic Superstore unit in 1995.
* Nova Scotia: These locations were sold to Oshawa Group and became IGA stores. However, after Sobeys purchased Oshawa in 1999, Loblaw took over IGA&#x27;s Atlantic Canada locations.
* Quebec: Dominion stores in Quebec were sold to Provigo in 1981; Provigo was acquired by Loblaws in 1998.

=== Battle over pension surplus ===
In 1985, during the chain&#x27;s breakup, the Argus-controlled Dominion Stores Ltd.—renamed Domgroup Ltd. in April 1986—withdrew $37.9 million from its defined benefit pension plan for Canadian employees. The amount represented an actuarial surplus in the plan, and Dominion had approval from the provincial regulator, the Pension Commission of Ontario (a predecessor entity to the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario) to make the withdrawal. However, the right to make that withdrawal was challenged by the union representing the employees, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. In September 1986, Justice Robert Reid of the Ontario Supreme Court of Justice ordered Domgroup to return the money to the plan, stating in his judgment that Dominion &quot;had no right, under the plan documents, to remove the surplus&quot;. Domgroup eventually reached a settlement with the union to withdraw a portion of the surplus.

=== A&amp;P&#x27;s &quot;New Dominion&quot; ===

A&amp;P placed the stores it acquired in 1985 under a subsidiary named New Dominion Stores Inc., and initially operated them under the &quot;New Dominion&quot; name (later adjusting the branding to &quot;Super Dominion&quot;). During a one-year transition period, these stores co-existed in Ontario with the &quot;old&quot; Dominion stores that Argus hadn&#x27;t sold to A&amp;P, causing customer confusion. At one point during this period, the head of A&amp;P Canada said he called Black personally to ensure the Argus-owned stores&#x27; marketing abided by the sale contract, as some ads had referenced those stores still being Canadian-owned (whereas A&amp;P was based in the U.S. and controlled by Germany&#x27;s Tengelmann Group). Most of the remaining &quot;old&quot; Dominion stores ultimately closed in early 1986, ahead of A&amp;P gaining exclusive rights to the name on April 30.

Beginning a few months after the acquisition, and continuing into the 1990s, A&amp;P rebranded all of its stores in the Greater Toronto Area as Dominion stores, absorbing Miracle Food Mart, while Dominion locations elsewhere in Ontario took the A&amp;P or Food Basics name.

The territory of Dominion stores was approximately the following: Toronto; York Region, excluding Stouffville; Mississauga and Oakville; and Pickering and Ajax.

=== Demise ===
 Metro, which had operated solely in Quebec and the Ottawa area, acquired A&amp;P Canada from the U.S.-based parent company effective August 15, 2005. A&amp;P retained a minority ownership share of the combined company for a time.

On August 7, 2008, Metro announced it would invest $200 million consolidating the company&#x27;s conventional food stores under the Metro banner. Over a period of 15 months, all stores were converted to the Metro name, beginning with the Dominion stores in the Toronto area.

Dominion&#x27;s distribution centres in Toronto and Mississauga retained the old Dominion banner until 2009.

<text>Real Atlantic Superstore is a Canadian supermarket chain. The chain operates in the Maritime Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. It is owned by George Weston Limited through Loblaw Companies Limited, and operates under the Atlantic Wholesalers division of Loblaws. Its name is often shortened to Superstore, or, less commonly, RASS.

The stores range in from 45,000 to over 120,000 square feet (4,000 to over 10,000 m2) in size. 

==Store services==
Despite the similarity in name to sister chain Real Canadian Superstore, not all Real Atlantic Superstores are hypermarkets: many are large supermarkets with little general merchandise. Others, however, are marketed as &quot;one stop&quot; stores (much like Real Canadian Superstore) and carry a wide variety of goods, including groceries, electronics, housewares, clothing, and generally offer services such as photo finishing and a pharmacy.

Some larger stores (60,000 to over 80,000 square feet) also have a community room, drive-through pharmacy, Mobil gas bar, liquor store (operated by the applicable provincial agency), tobacco shop, and walk-in medical clinics.

Real Atlantic Superstore has added self checkout registers at its larger stores which allow customers to scan the barcode of an item and make payment without any interaction with store employees.

Starting on April 22, 2009, some locations began charging 5 cents per plastic bag at checkouts, to promote the use of environmentally friendly reusable bags. On March 1, 2010, this practice was stopped. Following Canada&#x27;s single-use plastics ban, plastic bags are no longer available in stores. 15 cent paper bags are available for purchase at some, but not all locations.

In December 2017, click and collect, under the PC Express banner began in Atlantic Canada, starting with Atlantic Superstore locations in Halifax.

==History==
Loblaw entered Atlantic Canada through the acquisition of Atlantic Wholesalers, owner of the SaveEasy chain, in 1976.

In 1986, the company opened its first large-scale grocery store in Moncton, New Brunswick, using the name The Real Atlantic Superstore. In 1995, the name was shortened to Atlantic Superstore, and following the 2024 rebrand, the name was lengthened again to the present name, Real Atlantic Superstore. Further, the store designs were reformatted to the &quot;market style&quot; with the slogan &quot;Low Prices and More!&quot;. Most SaveEasy stores, excluding those in rural areas, were eventually converted to the SuperValu or Superstore format, either through renovation or relocation.

During the 1990s, the company&#x27;s headquarters were relocated from Sackville, New Brunswick to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. New warehousing facilities for just in time logistics distribution were built, and a huge expansion campaign brought new large-format stores to many centres in the region within a period of only several years. In the early 2000s, a marketing campaign was introduced to the superstores, changing their slogan to &quot;Eat Well, Spend Less&quot;. This was like a campaign carried out in Loblaws stores in Ontario. With the arrival of the Real Canadian Superstore concept in Ontario, Real Atlantic Superstore used a similar marketing campaign with the slogan &quot;Prices You Can Trust&quot;. This concept was used until 2009 when the &quot;Just Lower Prices&quot; campaign was launched.

On August 8, 2024, Real Atlantic Superstore launched its anticipated but controversial rebrand that better aligned the banner with its sister chain Real Canadian Superstore. The rebrand brought about new signage within and outside of its stores. The name, Real Atlantic Superstore, will be retained, despite earlier rumours that the name would be discontinued and replaced with Real Canadian Superstore. However, with the rebrand, came a new logo, which did take on RCSS&#x27;s branding style with a new logo to match, now including &quot;Real&quot; in the name. RASS also adopted RCSS&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Save for Real.&quot; The changes in store are said to help direct customers in store and help them make value choices.

== Slogans ==
* &quot;Low Prices and More!&quot;
* &quot;Eat Well, Spend Less&quot;
* &quot;Prices You Can Trust&quot;
* &quot;Just Lower Prices&quot;
* &quot;Bringing More to the Table&quot;
* 2024–present — &quot;Save For Real.&quot;

<text>Werner Wolff (October 7, 1883 – November 25, 1961) was a German-born conductor and musicologist who was conductor of the Hamburg Opera and founded the Chattanooga Opera Association in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

==Biography==
Wolff was born in Berlin in 1883, the son of Hermann and Louse Wolff. His father was a founder of the Berlin Philharmonic and a secretary to conductor and composer Hans von Bülow. Werner Wolff&#x27;s mother discouraged her son&#x27;s early interest in music as a profession, so he took a law degree at Baden, but continued to compose music as an avocation. Encouraged in his interest by prominent musicians in Berlin, he studied at the conservatory at Leipzig during the years before World War I.

Following his musical training, Wolff took positions with opera companies in Danzig, Düsseldorf, and Prague before becoming a conductor for the Hamburg Opera in 1917. He continued with the Hamburg Opera until 1932, developing a reputation as one of the leading conductors in Germany.

Wolff and his wife, operatic soprano Emmy Land, emigrated to the United States in 1938, fleeing Nazism. They resided in New York City until Wolff was employed as head of the music department at Tennessee Wesleyan College in Athens, Tennessee and Land became voice and music teacher at the same school. In the early 1940s they were hired by the University of Chattanooga and the Cadek Conservatory of Chattanooga, Tennessee as teachers. In 1942 Dr. Wolff wrote a book entitled &quot;Anton Bruckner, rustic genius&quot; (), in which he recounted the composer&#x27;s visit to his family when he was a boy.

Interested citizens learned of the Wolffs&#x27; operatic expertise from their great success in Europe (mainly in Hamburg, Vienna) and asked them to organize a Chattanooga Opera Association which they did in 1943. Madame Emmy Land Wolff died in 1955 and Dr. Wolff retired from opera five years later and returned to Rüschlikon, Switzerland, where he died in 1961. Many feel that this couple created a sensation with their opera productions in Chattanooga. The opera company they founded (now part of the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera) is still active.

<text>Samuel Williston (September 24, 1861 – February 18, 1963) was an American lawyer and law professor who authored an influential treatise on contracts.

== Early life, education and family ==

Williston was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to a family prosperous from the mercantile trade but whose fortunes declined during his youth, which he recalled, &quot;served as a spur to endeavor.&quot;

He was graduated from Harvard College in 1882 and worked for three years as a survey assistant for a railroad and teaching at a boarding school. An aunt&#x27;s bequest enabled him to enroll in Harvard Law School, where he thrived. He was an editor of the first volume of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;, and in 1888 he graduated first in his class with LL.B. and A.M. degrees.

On September 12, 1889, he married Mary Fairlie Wellman. They had two daughters: Dorothea Lewis Williston (Mrs. Murray F. Hall), and Margaret Fairlie Williston (Mrs. Chester B. McLaughlin, Jr.). His wife died in 1929.

== Legal career ==

Early in Williston&#x27;s career, from 1888 to 1889 he worked as the private secretary to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Horace Gray. In the summer of 1889, he helped to collate laws from various U.S. states in order to help formulate the state constitutions of North Dakota and South Dakota.

From 1895 to 1938, Williston was a law professor at Harvard Law School, and in 1910, he briefly served as acting dean. In 1903, he was named Weld Professor and, in 1919, was named to the Dane Professorship at Harvard. Students described him as &quot;a gentle, good-humored teacher who charmed his classes with hypothetical cases involving his horse, Dobbin, and who regularly invited students to dine with his family on Sundays,&quot; and &quot;a master of the Socratic method.&quot;

Amongst his most important contributions at this time were the drafting of four laws aimed at providing national commerce with a legally uniform architecture. The Uniform Laws of Sales (1906), Warehouse Receipts (1906), Bills of Lading (1909), and Stock Transfers (1909) would in fact serve as precedents for the construction of the Uniform Commercial Code some decades later.

The Uniform Commercial Code corrected defects in the Uniform Sales Act, such as the Uniform Sales Act&#x27;s reliance on title to determine which party (the buyer or the seller) bore the risk of loss. The UCC prescribed rules which allocate the risk of loss that do not depend on the location of title. The need to determine title under the Uniform Sales Act often led to expensive and protracted litigation which the Uniform Commercial Code has eliminated.

On December 10 and 11, 1913, Williston unsuccessfully argued for the defense in the case of &quot;Boston &amp; Maine Railroad v. Hooker&quot; before the U.S. Supreme Court. He became a consultant for the Boston law firm Hale &amp; Dorr, during which time he was involved in cases such as &quot;Kneeland v. American Loan Trust Company&quot; and &quot;Chase National Bank v. Sayles&quot;.

== Treatise on contracts ==

Williston wrote five volumes of his legal treatise, &quot;The Law of Contracts&quot;, which was first published during the span of 1920 to 1922. The treatise was widely acclaimed as the foremost authority on the topic and was later enlarged in 1938. As Michael Looney noted in the Boston College Law Review (of the 3rd edition): &quot;In the forty years since the original edition appeared, it has gained a pre-eminent place in that field. Quoted or cited by the courts of the United States, Great Britain, and its Dominions as well, it has become the standard authority.&quot;

In 1932, Williston served as reporter for the First Restatement of Contracts, a highly influential publication in the legal community. This treatise continues to exist to this day, currently edited by Richard A. Lord, professor at Campbell University Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law, although it has been superseded by the Restatement (Second) Contracts, and the Restatement (Second) effectively has been modified by the Uniform Commercial Code.

== Honors and legacy ==

Williston received accolades both during his lifetime and at the time of his death. In 1905, Williston was made a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded honorary degrees by Harvard, 1910; Amherst, 1923; and Yale, 1926. In 1929, he was honored with the very first American Bar Association Medal for &quot;conspicuous service to American jurisprudence.&quot;

In a 1963 &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; essay, Justice Felix Frankfurter lauded Williston as being the &quot;greatest artist in teaching.&quot; His statement of rules helped make commercial law predictable: &quot;The business life of this nation is based on the writings and the legislation that Samuel Williston drafted,&quot; said Harvard Law Professor Arthur E. Sutherland.

He, his work and his insistence on contractual formalism are often compared and contrasted to those of Yale Law School professor Arthur Linton Corbin, developer of the philosophy of law known as legal realism. Corbin was the writer of &quot;Corbin on Contracts&quot; and his influence is more evident in the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.

He lived to 101 years of age in spite of ill health in his mid-thirties that interfered with his teaching.

Williston is the namesake of the Williston Negotiation Competition at Harvard Law School.

<text>In topology, the long line (or [[Pavel Alexandrov|Alexandroff]] line) is a topological space somewhat similar to the real line, but in a certain sense &quot;longer&quot;. It behaves locally just like the real line, but has different large-scale properties (e.g., it is neither Lindelöf nor separable). Therefore, it serves as an important counterexample in topology. Intuitively, the usual real-number line consists of a countable number of line segments formula_1 laid end-to-end, whereas the long line is constructed from an uncountable number of such segments.

== Definition ==

The closed long ray formula_2 is defined as the Cartesian product of the first uncountable ordinal formula_3 with the half-open interval formula_4 equipped with the order topology that arises from the lexicographical order on formula_5. The open long ray is obtained from the closed long ray by removing the smallest element formula_6

The long line is obtained by &quot;gluing&quot; together two long rays, one in the positive direction and the other in the negative direction. More rigorously, it can be defined as the order topology on the disjoint union of the reversed open long ray (“reversed” means the order is reversed) (this is the negative half) and the (not reversed) closed long ray (the positive half), totally ordered by letting the points of the latter be greater than the points of the former. Alternatively, take two copies of the open long ray and identify the open interval formula_7 of the one with the same interval of the other but reversing the interval, that is, identify the point formula_8 (where formula_9 is a real number such that formula_10) of the one with the point formula_11 of the other, and define the long line to be the topological space obtained by gluing the two open long rays along the open interval identified between the two. (The former construction is better in the sense that it defines the order on the long line and shows that the topology is the order topology; the latter is better in the sense that it uses gluing along an open set, which is clearer from the topological point of view.)

Intuitively, the closed long ray is like a real (closed) half-line, except that it is much longer in one direction: we say that it is long at one end and closed at the other. The open long ray is like the real line (or equivalently an open half-line) except that it is much longer in one direction: we say that it is long at one end and short (open) at the other. The long line is longer than the real lines in both directions: we say that it is long in both directions.

However, many authors speak of the “long line” where we have spoken of the (closed or open) long ray, and there is much confusion between the various long spaces. In many uses or counterexamples, however, the distinction is unessential, because the important part is the “long” end of the line, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what happens at the other end (whether long, short, or closed).

A related space, the (closed) extended long ray, formula_12 is obtained as the one-point compactification of formula_2 by adjoining an additional element to the right end of formula_14 One can similarly define the extended long line by adding two elements to the long line, one at each end.

== Properties ==

The closed long ray formula_15 consists of an uncountable number of copies of formula_16 &#x27;pasted together&#x27; end-to-end. Compare this with the fact that for any ordinal formula_17, pasting together formula_17 copies of formula_16 gives a space which is still homeomorphic (and order-isomorphic) to formula_20 (And if we tried to glue together than formula_3 copies of formula_4 the resulting space would no longer be locally homeomorphic to formula_23)

Every increasing sequence in formula_2 converges to a limit in formula_2; this is a consequence of the facts that (1) the elements of formula_3 are the countable ordinals, (2) the supremum of every countable family of countable ordinals is a countable ordinal, and (3) every increasing and bounded sequence of real numbers converges.
Consequently, there can be no strictly increasing function formula_27 In fact, every continuous function formula_28 is eventually constant.

As order topologies, the (possibly extended) long rays and lines are normal Hausdorff spaces. All of them have the same cardinality as the real line, yet they are &#x27;much longer&#x27;.
All of them are locally compact. None of them is metrizable; this can be seen as the long ray is sequentially compact but not compact, or even Lindelöf.

The (non-extended) long line or ray is not paracompact. It is path-connected, locally path-connected and simply connected but not contractible. It is a one-dimensional topological manifold, with boundary in the case of the closed ray. It is first-countable but not second countable and not separable, so authors who require the latter properties in their manifolds do not call the long line a manifold.

It makes sense to consider all the long spaces at once because every connected (non-empty) one-dimensional (not necessarily separable) topological manifold possibly with boundary, is homeomorphic to either the circle, the closed interval, the open interval (real line), the half-open interval, the closed long ray, the open long ray, or the long line.

The long line or ray can be equipped with the structure of a (non-separable) differentiable manifold (with boundary in the case of the closed ray). However, contrary to the topological structure which is unique (topologically, there is only one way to make the real line &quot;longer&quot; at either end), the differentiable structure is not unique:
in fact, there are uncountably many (formula_29 to be precise) pairwise non-diffeomorphic smooth structures on it. This is in sharp contrast to the real line, where there are also different smooth structures, but all of them are diffeomorphic to the standard one.

The long line or ray can even be equipped with the structure of a (real) analytic manifold (with boundary in the case of the closed ray). However, this is much more difficult than for the differentiable case (it depends on the classification of (separable) one-dimensional analytic manifolds, which is more difficult than for differentiable manifolds). Again, any given formula_30 structure can be extended in infinitely many ways to different formula_31 (=analytic) structures (which are pairwise non-diffeomorphic as analytic manifolds).

The long line or ray cannot be equipped with a Riemannian metric that induces its topology.
The reason is that Riemannian manifolds, even without the assumption of paracompactness, can be shown to be metrizable.

The extended long ray formula_32 is compact. It is the one-point compactification of the closed long ray formula_33 but it is its Stone-Čech compactification, because any continuous function from the (closed or open) long ray to the real line is eventually constant. formula_32 is also connected, but not path-connected because the long line is &#x27;too long&#x27; to be covered by a path, which is a continuous image of an interval. formula_32 is not a manifold and is not first countable.

== &quot;p&quot;-adic analog ==

There exists a &quot;p&quot;-adic analog of the long line, which is due to George Bergman.

This space is constructed as the increasing union of an uncountable directed set of copies formula_36 of the ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers, indexed by a countable ordinal formula_37 
Define a map from formula_38to formula_36 whenever formula_40 as follows:
* If formula_41 is a successor formula_42 then the map from formula_43 to formula_36 is just multiplication by formula_45 For other formula_46 the map from formula_38 to formula_36 is the composition of the map from formula_38 to formula_43 and the map from formula_43 to formula_52
* If formula_41 is a limit ordinal then the direct limit of the sets formula_38 for formula_40 is a countable union of &quot;p&quot;-adic balls, so can be embedded in formula_56 as formula_36 with a point removed is also a countable union of &quot;p&quot;-adic balls. This defines compatible embeddings of formula_38 into formula_36 for all formula_60

This space is not compact, but the union of any countable set of compact subspaces has compact closure.

==Higher dimensions==

Some examples of non-paracompact manifolds in higher dimensions include the Prüfer manifold, products of any non-paracompact manifold with any non-empty manifold, the ball of long radius, and so on. The bagpipe theorem shows that there are formula_29 isomorphism classes of non-paracompact surfaces, even when a generalization of paracompactness, ω-boundedness, is assumed.

There are no complex analogues of the long line as every Riemann surface is paracompact, but Calabi and Rosenlicht gave an example of a non-paracompact complex manifold of complex dimension 2.

<text>In telecommunications, a long line is a transmission line in a long-distance communications network such as carrier systems, microwave radio relay links, geosynchronous satellite links, underground cables, aerial cables and open wire, and Submarine communications cables. In the United States, some of this technology was spun off into the corporate entity known as &quot;AT&amp;T Long Distance&quot; with the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984. Previously, the AT&amp;T Long Lines division of the Bell System provided maintenance and installation of long line facilities for the Bell System&#x27;s long-distance service.

<text>Longline fishing, or longlining, is a commercial fishing angling technique that uses a long &quot;main line&quot; with baited hooks attached at intervals via short branch lines called &quot;snoods&quot; or &quot;gangions&quot;. A snood is attached to the main line using a clip or swivel, with the hook at the other end. Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. Lines can also be set by means of an anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. This can lead to the death of many different marine species known as bycatch. Longliners – fishing vessels rigged for longlining – commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sablefish and many other species.

In some unstable fisheries, such as the Patagonian toothfish, fishermen may be limited to as few as 25 hooks per line. In contrast, commercial longliners in certain robust fisheries of the Bering Sea and North Pacific generally run over 2,500 hand-baited hooks on a single series of connected lines many miles in length.

Longlines can be set to hang near the surface (pelagic longline) to catch fish such as tuna and swordfish or along the sea floor (demersal longline) for groundfish such as halibut or cod. Longliners fishing for sablefish, also referred to as black cod, occasionally set gear on the sea floor at depths exceeding using relatively simple equipment. Longlines with traps attached rather than hooks can be used for crab fishing in deep waters.

Longline fishing is prone to the incidental catching and killing of dolphins, seabirds, sea turtles, and sharks, but less so than deep sea trawling.

In Hawaii, where Japanese immigrants introduced longlining in 1917, longline fishing was known as flagline fishing because of the use of flags to mark floats from which hooks were suspended. The term &quot;flagline fishing&quot; persisted until local fishing vessels began to use modern monofilament mainline, line setters, and large, hydraulically powered reels, when the term &quot;longline fishing&quot; was adopted.

==Incidental catch==


Longline fishing is controversial because of bycatch, fish caught while seeking another species or immature juveniles of the target species. This can cause many issues, such as the killing of many other marine animals while seeking certain commercial fish. Seabirds can be particularly vulnerable during the setting of the line.

Methods to mitigate incidental mortality have succeeded in some fisheries. Mitigation techniques include the use of weights to ensure the lines sink quickly, the deployment of streamer lines to scare away birds, lasers, setting lines only at night in low light (to avoid attracting birds), limiting fishing seasons to the southern winter (when most seabirds are not feeding young), and not discharging offal while setting lines.

The Hawaii-based longline fishery for swordfish was closed in 2000 over concerns of excessive sea turtle by-catch, particularly loggerhead sea turtles and leatherback turtles. Changes to the management rules allowed the fishery to reopen in 2004. Gear modification, particularly a change to large circle-hooks and mackerel-type baits, eliminated much of the sea turtle by-catch associated with the fishing technique. It has been claimed that one consequence of the closure was that 70 Hawaii-based vessels were replaced by 1,500–1,700 longline vessels from various Asian nations, but this is not based on any reliable data . Due to poor and often non-existent catch documentation by these vessels, the number of sea turtles and albatross caught by these vessels between 2000 and 2004 will never be known . Hawaii longline fishing for swordfish closed again on 17 March 2006, when the by-catch limit of 17 loggerhead turtles was reached. In 2010 the by-catch limit for loggerhead turtles was raised, but was restored to the former limit as a result of litigation. The Hawaii-based longline fisheries for tuna and swordfish are managed under sets of slightly different rules. The tuna fishery is one of the best managed fisheries in the world, according to the UN Code of Responsible Fishing, but has been criticized by others, as being responsible for continuing by-catch of false killer whales, seabirds, and other nontargeted wildlife, as well as placing pressure on depleted bigeye tuna stocks.

Commercial longline fishing is also one of the main threats to albatrosses, posing a particularly serious threat to their survival. Of the 22 albatross species recognized by the IUCN Red List, 15 are threatened with extinction. The IUCN lists two species as Critically Endangered (Tristan albatross and waved albatross), seven species as Endangered, and six as Vulnerable. Albatrosses and other seabirds which readily feed on offal are attracted to the set bait, become hooked on the lines and drown. An estimated 8,000 albatross per year are killed in this way. These activities, however, are not randomly spread across the vast oceans, but rather are highly spatially concentrated. Therefore, the bird conservation lobby should work closely with regional fisheries management organizations to devise and implement targeted interventions aimed at reducing potential illegal longline fishing, which, in turn, will likely have positive effects on albatrosses. A simple device which can be fitted onto longlines, known as Hookpod, has been proposed for mitigation of seabird bycatch; Hookpod was rolled out to a total of 15 commercial fishing vessels in New Zealand after a change in regulations in January 2020, with a result of zero seabird bycatch in the first 6 months.

== Microplastics ==
Oceanic microplastics pollution is largely caused by plastic-made fishing gear like longline fishing equipment or drift nets, that are worn down by use, lost or thrown away.

== Safety ==
In the US, a study found that the risk for non-fatal injuries was 35 per 1,000 full-time equivalent employees, about three times higher than average U.S. worker. (This is compared to 43 per 1,000 in the trawler fleet).

<doc id="338409" wikidata="Q482517" url="?curid=338409" title="Chaebol">
<text>A chaebol ( , ; , ) is a large industrial South Korean conglomerate run and controlled by an individual or family. A chaebol often consists of multiple diversified affiliates, controlled by a person or group. Several dozen large South Korean family-controlled corporate groups fall under this definition. The term first appeared in English text in 1972.

Chaebol have also played a significant role in South Korean politics. In 1988, a member of a chaebol family, Chung Mong-joon, president of Hyundai Heavy Industries, successfully ran for the National Assembly of South Korea. Other business leaders were also chosen to be members of the National Assembly through proportional representation. Hyundai has made efforts in the thawing of North Korean relations, despite some controversy. Many South Korean family-run chaebol have been criticised for low dividend payouts and other governance practices that favor controlling shareholders at the expense of ordinary investors.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Chaebol&quot; is derived from the McCune–Reischauer romanization of the Korean word (&quot;chaebŏl&quot;), without the breve above the o. In 2000, the South Korean Ministry of Tourism introduced a new system of converting the Korean language into the Roman alphabet called Revised Romanization. Under the new transliteration style, is written as &quot;jaebeol&quot;, not chaebol. Despite McCune–Reischauer being largely abandoned in South Korea, the term is still ubiquitously written as chaebol.

The word originates from the Sino-Japanese term &quot;zaibatsu&quot; (), where means &#x27;wealth&#x27; and means &#x27;clan&#x27;. The Japanese zaibatsu dominated their economy from 1868 until they were dissolved under the American Occupation of Japan in 1945. The rise and proliferation of the Korean chaebol resembles the Japanese zaibatsu at their peak.

The word has been loaned into English since at least 1972.

==History==

South Korea&#x27;s economy was small and predominantly agricultural well into the mid-20th century. However, the policies of President Park Chung Hee spurred rapid industrialisation by promoting large businesses, following his seizure of power in 1961. The First Five Year Economic Plan by the government set industrial policy towards new investment, and chaebols were to be guaranteed loans from the banking sector. The chaebol played a key role in developing new industries, markets, and export production, helping make South Korea one of the Four Asian Tigers.

Although South Korea&#x27;s major industrial programs did not begin until the early 1960s, the origins of the country&#x27;s entrepreneurial elite were found in the political economy of the 1950s. Very few Koreans owned or managed larger corporations during the Japanese colonial period. After the Japanese left in 1945, some Korean businessmen obtained the assets of some of the Japanese firms, several of which grew into the chaebols of the 1990s.

The Japanese colonial government sometimes sought to co-opt local businessmen, and wealthy individuals often linked to land ownership, and a significant minority of industries were jointly owned by Japanese and Korean businesses. A few Korean chaebols such as Kyungbang came into existence during this era.

The companies, as well as certain other firms that were formed in the late 1940s and early 1950s, had close links with Syngman Rhee&#x27;s First Republic, which lasted from 1948 to 1960. It is confirmed that many of these companies received special treatment from the government in return for kickbacks and other payments.

When the military took over the government in 1961, its leaders announced that they would eradicate the corruption that had plagued the Rhee administration and eliminate &quot;injustice&quot; from society. Some leading industrialists were arrested and charged with corruption, but the new government realized that it would need the help of entrepreneurs if the government&#x27;s ambitious plans to modernize the economy were to be fulfilled. A compromise was reached, under which many of the accused corporate leaders paid fines to the government. Subsequently, there was increased cooperation between corporate and government leaders in modernizing the economy.

Government-chaebol cooperation was essential to the subsequent economic growth and astounding successes that began in the early 1960s. Driven by the urgent need to turn the economy away from consumer goods and light industries toward heavy, chemical, and import-substitution industries, political leaders and government planners relied on the ideas and cooperation of chaebol leaders. The government provided the blueprints for industrial expansion; the chaebol realized the plans. However, the chaebol-led industrialization accelerated the monopolistic and oligopolistic concentration of capital and economically profitable activities in the hands of a limited number of conglomerates.

Park used the chaebol as a means of economic growth. Exports were encouraged, reversing Rhee&#x27;s policy of reliance on imports. Performance quotas were established.

Chaebols were able to grow because of two factors: foreign loans and special favours. Access to foreign technology also was critical to the growth of the chaebol through the 1980s. Under the guise of &quot;guided capitalism&quot;, the government selected companies to undertake projects and channelled funds from foreign loans. The government guaranteed repayment should a company be unable to repay its foreign creditors. Additional loans were made available from domestic banks. In the late 1980s, chaebols dominated the industrial sector and were especially prevalent in manufacturing, trading, and heavy industries.

Chaebols experienced tremendous growth beginning in the early 1960s in connection with the expansion of South Korean exports. The growth resulted from the production of a diversity of goods rather than just one or two products. Innovation and the willingness to develop new product lines were critical. In the 1950s and early 1960s, chaebols concentrated on wigs and textiles; by the mid-1970s and 1980s, heavy, defence, and chemical industries had become predominant. While these activities were important in the early 1990s, real growth was occurring in the electronics and high-technology industries. Chaebols also were responsible for turning the trade deficit in 1985 into a trade surplus in 1986. The current account balance, however, fell from more than US$14 billion in 1988 to US$5 billion in 1989.

Chaebols continued their explosive growth in export markets in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, they had become financially independent and secure, thereby eliminating the need for further government-sponsored credit and assistance.

By the 1990s, South Korea was one of the largest newly industrialised countries and boasted a standard of living comparable to industrialized countries.

President Kim Young-sam began to challenge the chaebol, but it was not until the 1997 Asian financial crisis that the weaknesses of the system were widely understood. Of the 30 largest chaebols, 11 collapsed between July 1997 and June 1999. Initially, the crisis was caused by a sharp drop in the value of the currency and led to immediate cash flow concerns needed to pay foreign debts; however, the lower costs ultimately helped the stronger chaebols expand their brands to Western markets. Yet, the decline of nearby export markets in Southeast Asia, which had been fueling growth by incurring large debts, proved fatal to many. The remaining chaebols also became far more specialized in their focus. For example, with a population ranked 26th in the world, before the crisis, the country had seven major automobile manufacturers. Afterward, only two major manufacturers remained intact though two additional continued, in a smaller capacity, under General Motors and Renault. Chaebol debts were not only to state industrial banks but also to independent banks and their financial services subsidiaries. The scale of the loan defaults meant that banks could neither foreclose nor write off bad loans without themselves collapsing, so the failure to service these debts quickly caused a systemic banking crisis, and South Korea turned to the IMF for assistance. The most spectacular example came in mid-1999, with the collapse of the Daewoo Group, which had some US$80 billion in unpaid debt. At the time, it was the largest corporate bankruptcy in history.

Investigations also exposed widespread corruption in the chaebol, particularly fraudulent accounting, and bribery.

Still, South Korea recovered quickly from the crisis, and most of the blame for economic problems was shifted to the IMF. The remaining chaebols have grown substantially since the crisis, but they have maintained far lower debt levels.

In 2019, the revenue of the largest chaebol, Samsung, was worth about 17% of the South Korean GDP with the company holding billions of dollars in cash. In 2023 the revenue of the top four chaebol (Samsung, SK, Hyundai, and LG) was worth 40.8% of the South Korean GDP, and the top thirty chaebol were worth 76.9% of GDP.

However, recent financial statements of these chaebols showed that chaebols are slowly losing power due to either international competition or internal disruptions from newly emerging startups. The net profit/income of South Korea&#x27;s top conglomerates decreased from 2012 to 2015.

== Corporate governance ==

=== Management structure ===
Some chaebols are one large corporation while others have broken up into loosely connected groups of separate companies sharing a common name. Even in the latter case, each is almost always owned, controlled, or managed by the same family group.

South Korea&#x27;s chaebols are often compared with Japan&#x27;s &quot;keiretsu&quot; business groupings, the successors of the pre-war zaibatsu, but they have some major differences:
* Chaebols are still largely controlled by their founding families while &quot;keiretsu&quot; are controlled by groups of professional managers. Chaebols, furthermore, are more family-based and family-oriented than their Japanese counterparts.
* Chaebols are centralized in ownership while &quot;keiretsu&quot; are more decentralized.
* Chaebols have more often formed subsidiaries to produce components for exports while large Japanese corporations have mostly switched to employing outside contractors.
* The major structural difference between Korean chaebols and Japanese &quot;keiretsu&quot; is that chaebols do not have affiliated banks for credit access. Most were heavily dependent on government loans and loan guarantees in their early years, and they still have a closer relationship with the government than their Japanese counterparts. Chaebols are largely prohibited from owning private banks, partly to spread risk and partly to increase the government&#x27;s leverage over the banks in areas such as credit allocation. In 1990, government regulations made it difficult for a chaebol to develop an exclusive banking relationship, but following the cascading collapses of the late 1990s, they were somewhat relaxed. &quot;Keiretsu&quot; has historically worked with an affiliated bank, giving the affiliated companies almost unlimited access to credit, so the economic problems for which the Japanese have been known are zombie banks rather than systemic banking crises. However, many of the largest &quot;keiretsu&quot; have diversified their debt practices, and public bond sales have become somewhat common.

The chaebol model is heavily reliant on a complex system of interlocking ownership. The owner, with the help of family members, family-owned charities, and senior managers from subsidiaries, has to control only three or four public companies, which control other companies that control subsidiaries. A good example of this practice would be the owner of Doosan, who controlled more than 20 subsidiaries with only minor participation in about 5 companies.

=== Equity ===
The chairman of a typical chaebol possesses a small portion of the equity in the companies under the large umbrella of the chaebol but is very powerful in making decisions and controls all management. For example, Samsung owns 0.5% of the group&#x27;s listed firms. That demonstrates a weakness in the rule of law. The method that allows this type of possession is called cross-holding, which is a horizontal and vertical structure that enhances the control of the chairman.

=== Workplace culture ===
The typical culture at one of these conglomerates is highly paternalistic. Much of the environment is defined by the chairman who acts as a &quot;fatherly figure&quot; to his subordinates. This can be traced back to the infusion of Neo-Confucian values that permeate Korean society. A chaebol head&#x27;s demeanour towards his employee can be described as &quot;loving&quot; while maintaining &quot;sternness and a sense of responsibility&quot;. Workers commit to long hours, most notably on weekends and holidays, to appease their superiors. Company outings and drinking sessions tend to be compulsory to foster a sense of family and belonging among employees. Employers believe that enhancing a common bond between them would translate into prosperity and productivity for the company. Other practices that would be uncommon for Western workplaces to engage in include gift-giving to employees and arranging dates for workers in search of relationships or marriage.

Chaebols are notoriously hierarchical. As such, it is unusual for an individual to challenge or question the decision-making of his or her boss. This dynamic adds to the culture that orients itself around whoever is in charge but can lead to undesirable circumstances. For example, the Asiana flight 214 crash led critics to speculate that cultural factors prevented a pilot on board from aborting the low-speed landing and thus straying from his superior&#x27;s commands. Promotion is rarely merit-based. Rather, it is through the order of age and time served to the conglomerate. This is reflected by the fact that most executives are far older than their employees. If a worker does not attain an executive or senior-management role by the age of fifty, he or she is commonly forced to resign. Again, this is attributable to the age-hierarchy dynamics in Korean Confucian culture. A typical firm heavily emphasizes loyalty to the firm, as demonstrated in the standard recruiting process. Newly acquired employees undergo an intense initiation that includes activities such as training camps and singing company-unique songs that reiterate the production goals of the firm.

===Emergence and inflation===
The origins of the chaebol system in South Korea come as a consequence of the Korean War. The war resulted in much destruction and halted industrial production, which led the government to print money to pay for the war and meet the requirements of the United Nations forces for the Korean currency, all of which caused mass inflation. This inflation caused many commodity prices to double every six months.

The government had to react and so devised a plan in providing strong financial incentives to private companies between the 1960s and 1970s. These included the government&#x27;s choosing to select various family businesses to distribute the incentives (imported raw materials, commodities, bank loans). The impact was immediate, and most of the businesses flourished rapidly. The protection of infant companies allowed them to develop because of the highly regulated market, which prevented foreign companies from entering. Many companies that were not in the circle of businesses saw the system as flawed and corrupted. Corruption scandals have occurred periodically in all chaebols. Such incidents suggest a form of &quot;crony capitalism&quot; which is common in developing countries.

===Internal market transactions accountability===
Because the government gave out incentives to help businesses, it had a lot of control over them. However, there was no way to ensure the businesses would use the incentives effectively and efficiently. In other words, there was no external monitoring system to monitor chaebols and ensure that they were efficient in the allocation of resources. All businesses undertake internal market transactions, which constitute &quot;purchase and sale of intermediate inputs, the provision and receipt of loan collaterals, and the provision and receipt of payment guarantees among member firms in a business group&quot;. There is the question of efficiency, especially in production and management. Therefore, the chaebol system was not very transparent. Behind the scenes, businesses were provided with subsidiary financing and intragroup transactions. This allowed them easy loans to cover their deficits, and before the 1997 Asian financial crisis, huge debts had accumulated, many of which were hidden. That gave the illusion that the system was flourishing into the 1990s.

===Relationship with foreign investors===
According to the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center, the majority of South Korea&#x27;s economy is driven by exports. South Korea is one of the leading exporters worldwide. Additionally, the majority of investors in the Korean stock market are foreign investors. Out of 711 listed companies in the Korean stock market, approximately 683 have shares that are held by foreign investors. Nearly a third of the market&#x27;s value is owned by foreigners, a trend that is expected to continue.

Because of their major role in the Korean stock market, foreign investors play a massive part in whether or not chaebol conglomerates remain financially successful. Foreign investors tend to avoid chaebols, especially those that displayed heavy political influence in South Korea, like Samsung and Hyundai. Investors are reluctant to invest in large control-ownership disparity businesses because these companies tended to cheat shareholders to have higher personal financial gain. This information is extremely helpful, especially when it comes to determining how these corrupt conglomerates are still heavily supported, considering foreign investors show little interest in them. However, a study published in the Journal of the Japanese and International Economies found that after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, foreign investment behavioural patterns changed drastically. While foreign investors like to hold shares in large companies with high profit and liquidity margins, they do not show any particular interest in either chaebol or non-chaebol companies. As of January 2025, many Chaebol corporations have a high share of foreign investors, with Samsung Electronics 73% and Hyundai Motors is 50% SK Hynics is 55.8%. Nonetheless, chaebols are still able to survive, highlighting just how much power and aid they receive from the Korean government.

===&quot;Too big to fail&quot;===

During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, bankers feared that chaebols would go bankrupt so they allowed these businesses to roll over their loans each time they were unable to repay their debts. Many did not believe that the chaebols were capable of collapsing and that the more they borrowed, the safer they were.

However, the theory was proven wrong when many businesses collapsed during the crisis. Since they were linked through debt guarantees, many of the companies fell into a chain reaction. The focus on capacity expansion created debt that was manageable when the economy was growing. However, when the economy stalled, debt-to-equity ratios became a huge problem.

Since the crisis, chaebols had less debt and were less vulnerable to similar crises, as was demonstrated in the 2008 crisis. With the growth of the fewer remaining chaebols, however, each of them occupies a larger portion of the economy, with the largest chaebols making up (by sales revenue) a substantial portion of South Korea&#x27;s GDP.

=== Monopolistic behavior ===
The protectionist policies and preferable government treatment granted chaebols the ability to exhibit monopolistic behaviour. The absence of a market free of intervention meant that &quot;true competition&quot; became a rarity in South Korea. Especially in the era before the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the only products available to the Korean people were those made by chaebols. Therefore, the social fabric of the country lacked a welcoming culture toward entrepreneurship. The intensity and extent of market concentration became evident as 80% of the country&#x27;s GDP is derived from chaebols. The largest of the group, Samsung, exports 20% of South Korea&#x27;s goods and services alone. Although no longer financially supported by the government, these firms have attained economies of scale on such a massive level that it is extremely difficult for a startup or small or medium enterprise (SME) to surmount the high barriers to entry. A majority of these smaller companies ended up becoming acquired by the chaebols, thereby further stacking their size and economic dominance. During recent years a growing trend to scale globally has increased among aspiring Korean entrepreneurs. Conversely, chaebols have also been moving money abroad with the tacit endorsement of the South Korean government and investing in commercial enterprises, particularly in Koreatown Manhattan, New York City.

To this day, chaebols maintain dominance across all industries. Reductions in tariffs and the removal of trade regulations designed to protect Korean conglomerates have led to increased competition from abroad. However, among domestic firms, chaebols have kept their market share intact. Most notably, Apple&#x27;s entry into the smartphone market pressured rival Samsung into diversifying its revenue streams from overseas. All but 3 of the top 50 firms listed on the Korean Stock Exchange are designated as chaebols, and despite chaebols only accounting for just over 10 per cent of the country&#x27;s workers, the four largest chaebols hold 70 per cent of total market capitalization, and all chaebols together holding 77 per cent as of the late 2010s. Consequently, chaebols have more bargaining power and often take pricing action that squeezes both suppliers and consumers. Typically the firms down the supply chain fail to increase their profit margins enough to expand and thus never see growth. Collusion among chaebols is commonplace. Price-fixing acts mean consumers expect to pay an inflated value for most goods and services. For instance, in 2012 Samsung and LG Electronics were fined for colluding to raise prices for home appliances.

=== Government ties, corruption, and abuse of power ===
Since the inception of the chaebol, the government has been closely involved in its affairs. Many of the reforms enacted over the years, especially those under President Kim Dae-Jung, have cracked down on kickbacks and preferential treatment. Moreover, the state is no longer a majority shareholder of any chaebol. But their sheer size and wealth have been used to gain influence. For the most part, the government sees the function of chaebols as crucial to the Korean economy. When President Lee Myung-Bak took office, he pardoned Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-Hee for tax evasion. President Lee then proceeded to champion pro-chaebol deals, including a nuclear energy contract with the city of Abu Dhabi, and loosened laws preventing the conglomerates from owning financial services companies. Samsung&#x27;s leader is not the only chaebol chairman to be excused from a criminal conviction. Choi Tae-Won of SK Group, Chung Mong-Koo of Hyundai, Kim Seung-Youn of Hanwha, and Shin Dong-bin of Lotte are a few examples of chairmen who have been charged, convicted, or are currently serving a prison sentence for white-collar crime. Accusations include bribery, tax evasion, accounting fraud, embezzlement, and violent crime. Typically chaebol chairmen are pardoned. In the rare case that an executive is sentenced to prison, as the CEOs of SK and CJ group were, it is typically a relatively light punishment of up to 4 years depending on the charge.

Collusion between chaebol members and the government granted preferential statuses to the companies. A chaebol would funnel bribes to politicians and bureaucrats through slush funds and illegal donations. This could help maintain the government&#x27;s position of power, allowing them to secure contracts for major government projects and provide favourable treatment to the donor firm. Examples of this type of corruption were widespread in the years leading up to the 1997 financial crisis. Many of the firms that benefited from this relationship were too indebted, had poor corporate governance, and were inefficient. There was a huge inflow of capital and a bending of regulation in favour of these problematic firms. Hanbo Group, formerly South Korea&#x27;s second-largest steel-maker, is a good example of this. In the 1990s the company paid for special arrangements with high-ranking politicians so that it could secure contracts for large government projects over its competitors. Hanbo went bankrupt in 1997 after defaulting on debt payments along with other governance issues. Numerous chaebol companies had similar private agreements with the government in this fashion. It would be most common in companies dealing with heavy industries or projects that involved government procurement and urban planning. In the past, most successful political elections were won with chaebol support. Each time a new administration or regime stepped in, it would gear its policy platform towards chaebol revitalization. This was under the claim that to be a competitive economy more power must be given to the chaebols. In recent years, the leading political parties of South Korea have shifted their focus from supporting large corporations to promoting economic diversification.

== Reforms ==
Different reforms have been proposed or enacted to deal with the influence, power, and corruption associated with the chaebols, though it has been questioned whether real reform is possible.

=== IMF agreement ===
Under Kim Dae-Jung and in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, many reforms were made to the chaebols. Most of these changes pertained to corporate structure, transparency in financial reporting, cuts in government subsidies, corporate governance, and debt stabilization. In 1997, the IMF provided a bailout loan of $60 billion conditional on revision. Distressed financial institutions were to be closed down and those that were deemed viable were to be restructured and recapitalized by the levels it set forth. This affected the chaebol because it severely restricted its easy access to financing which led to over-leveraged balance sheets. Lenient accounting practices and disclosure rules were to be strengthened and standardized for international practice. Hence, transparency was increased to what would be expected from a public company. The chaebols agreed to be subject to independent auditors and were obligated to provide consolidated financial statements regularly.

=== Government-led reforms and the 2008 crisis ===
Kim Dae-Jung enacted what is known as the &quot;Five Principles of Corporate Governance&quot;. These were the enhancement of management transparency, strengthening owner-manager accountability, elimination of cross-debt guarantees among chaebol affiliates, improvement of capital structures, and consolidation of core business areas. In his plans, debt-to-equity ratios was to be below 200%. Chaebol subsidiaries that were debt-laden or on the verge of bankruptcy were instructed to be either liquidated, sold, or put up for merger. Each chaebol-holding group had to break up its subsidiaries and operations so that they were more manageable. By the end of 1997, each had an average of 26.8 subsidiaries. It was hoped that if there were fewer activities, the quality of the remaining businesses would see improvement. Many unrelated branches to their core competencies were swiftly shed. If any of the conglomerates failed to meet the conditions by the set deadlines, strict sanctions would be passed against them. During the 2008 financial crisis, many of these reforms ensured chaebols&#x27; quick recovery. Having had exposure to a massive recession before, they learned to cope better than those in foreign countries. With significantly healthier balance sheets and higher cash reserves, the chaebols were able to avoid any liquidity issues. Moreover, with fewer subsidiaries, they were less exposed to the full scope of the crisis and thus helped keep the Korean economy afloat.

President Roh Moo Hyun pushed for even more extensive reform. His administration passed stringent regulations on fraudulent accounting, stock manipulation, and irregular wealth succession. Chaebols were forced to improve objectivity on their board of directors. Rather than having the decision-makers be insiders, affiliates, or family members, chaebols were expected to hold representation that reflected the interests of investors, especially minority shareholders who gained a significant number of rights. As a result, it became easier for chaebols to raise capital through equity rather than riskier debt. This is because the new transparency laws and restructuring boosted investor confidence from abroad.

==Regulation==

Some competition laws were passed to attempt to limit the expansion of chaebol:
* Law for separate finance from industry (): Chaebols may no longer have banks since 1982
* Law for the limit of investment (): A chaebol&#x27;s growth by M&amp;A was limited until 2009
* Law for the limit of assurance (): Law defends the insolvency of a chaebol&#x27;s affiliates

Formally, the Korea Fair Trade Commission announces a limited chaebol list every year by size of industrial assets (not including financial companies).
* Appointment: Korea Fair Trade Commission
* Inclusion: industrial groups (assets: 5 trillion won or more)
* Exclusion: bank and financial groups

The following charts list chaebols in order by different categories.

== Depictions in popular culture ==
Like many other conglomerates across the world, Korean chaebols have a presence in popular media. There are a large number of K-dramas that feature chaebols and chaebol family members. Some of these shows, including &quot;A Business Proposal&quot;, &quot;Coffee Prince&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with Secretary Kim&quot;, &quot;King the Land&quot;, and &quot;The Heirs&quot;, portray the lifestyles of chaebol family members in a comedic manner. Other dramas, however, portray chaebol family members being materialistic and arrogant, including &quot;Innocent Defendant&quot;, &quot;Remember&quot;, &quot;Vincenzo&quot;, &quot;Reborn Rich&quot;, and &quot;Big Mouth&quot;, reflecting the huge income inequality and political corruption related to chaebols in South Korea.

In addition, many chaebol family members have taken to social media outlets like Instagram and Twitter, where they publish snippets of their personal lives. Some chaebols also partake in popular social media trends like mukbangs, as is seen on the popular YouTube channel 햄연지 YONJIHAM. Some have suggested that these attempts at humanizing chaebols are purely financial strategies.

<text>Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle (20 August 151721 September 1586), Comte de La Baume Saint Amour, typically known as Cardinal Granvelle in English, was a Burgundian statesman, made a cardinal, who followed his father as a leading minister of the Spanish Habsburgs, and was one of the most influential European politicians during the time which immediately followed the appearance of Protestantism in Europe; &quot;the dominating Imperial statesman of the whole century&quot;.
He was also a notable art collector, the &quot;greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of Titian and Leoni and many other artists&quot;.

==Biography==

He was born in the Free Imperial City of Besançon, now in France, then a self-governing city surrounded by the Imperial territory of the County of Burgundy (Franche-Comté). 

His father, Nicholas Perrenot de Granvelle (1484–1550), afterwards became chancellor of the empire under Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, held an influential position in the Netherlands, and from 1530 until his death he was one of the emperor&#x27;s most trusted advisers in Germany. On the completion of his studies in law at Padua and in divinity at Leuven, Antoine held a canonry at Besançon, nowadays in eastern France, then was promoted to the bishopric of Arras with a dispensation due to his age of barely twenty-three (1540). He was ordained into the priesthood in 1540.

In his episcopal capacity he attended several diets of the empire, as well as the opening meetings of the Council of Trent, which he addressed on behalf of Charles V. The influence of his father, now chancellor, led to Granvelle being entrusted with many difficult and delicate pieces of public business. In the execution of these tasks he developed a talent for diplomacy, while at the same time acquiring an intimate acquaintance with most of the currents of European politics. He was involved in the settlement of the terms of peace after the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League at the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547, a settlement in which, to say the least, some particularly sharp practice was exhibited. 

In 1550, he succeeded his father in the office of secretary of state; in this capacity he attended Charles in the war with Maurice of Saxony, accompanied him in the flight from Innsbruck, and afterwards drew up the Peace of Passau (August 1552). In the following year he and Simon Renard, the ambassador of Charles V to the Queen Mary I of England, conducted the negotiations for the marriage of Mary and Philip II of Spain. It was to Philip in 1555, on the abdication of the emperor, that Granvelle transferred his services, and by whom he was employed in the Netherlands.

In April 1559, Granvelle was one of the Spanish signatories for the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, and on Philip&#x27;s withdrawal from the Netherlands in August of the same year he was surreptitiously appointed chief councillor to the regent Margaret of Parma. 

The policy of repression which in this capacity he pursued during the next five years secured for him many tangible rewards: in 1560 he was elevated to the archepiscopal see of Mechelen, and in 1561 he became a cardinal; but the growing hostility of a people whose religious convictions he had set himself to oppose ultimately made it impossible for him to continue in the Netherlands. On the advice of his royal master he retired to Franche-Comté in March 1564.

After a visit to Rome in 1565; in November 1566 he was appointed as member of the Congregation of &quot;Principi&quot;, the centre of the Papal States&#x27; foreign policy, by Pope Pius V. 

In 1570, Granvelle, at the request of Philip, helped to arrange the alliance between the Papacy, Venice and Spain against the Turks, an alliance which was responsible for the victory of Lepanto the next year. In the same year he became viceroy of Naples, a post of some difficulty and danger, which for five years he occupied with ability and success. He was summoned to Madrid in 1575 by Philip II to be president of the Council for Italian affairs.

Among the more delicate negotiations of his later years were those of 1580, which had for their object the ultimate union of the crowns of Spain and Portugal, and those of 1584, which resulted in a check to France by the marriage of the Spanish infanta Catherine to Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy. In the same year he was made archbishop of Besançon, but meanwhile he had been stricken with a lingering disease; he was never enthroned, but died at Madrid in 1586. His body was taken to Besançon Cathedral, where his father had been buried. There is a cenotaph in his honor within Saint Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral, Mechelen.

==Collector of art==
Granvelle had a famous art collection, which partly featured the favourite artists of his Habsburg patrons, such as Titian and Leone Leoni, but also included a number of works by Pieter Bruegel, as well as a significant collection inherited from his father. 

Bruegel&#x27;s friend, sculptor Jacques Jonghelinck (brother of Bruegel&#x27;s biggest patron) had a studio in Granvelle&#x27;s palace in Brussels. Whilst in the Netherlands, he &quot;discovered&quot; Antonis Mor and introduced him to the Madrid court, and he also patronised Giambologna and arranged his first visit to Italy.

At his death the collection was inherited by his nephew, who was pressured by Rudolf II, the very acquisitive Austrian Habsburg Emperor, to sell the finest pieces to him, which in 1597 he very reluctantly did, protesting that the price offered for thirty-three works was not enough even for six, and less than he had recently refused from Cardinal Farnese for Dürer&#x27;s &quot;Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand&quot; alone. The arrangements were handled by Hans von Aachen. Most of these pieces are now in Vienna or Madrid, including Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus with an Organ-player&quot;, Giambologna&#x27;s copy of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, tapestries after cartoons by Hieronymus Bosch and a bust of Charles V by Leoni.

Though he was painted by Titian and Mor, more famous than any portrait of Granvelle himself is the portrait of his dwarf and his mastiff by Mor, now at the Musée du Louvre. which perhaps initiated the Spanish tradition of portraits of court dwarfs. 

The Flemish Renaissance humanist Justus Lipsius was Granvelle&#x27;s secretary for a period in Rome. He also corresponded with the composers Lassus and Adrian Willaert. He had a magnificent library, some of which remains at Besançon.

<text>Trading stamps were small paper stamps given to customers by merchants in loyalty programs in the United States, Canada and the U.K. which predated the modern loyalty card-based and online programs. Like the similarly-issued retailer coupons, these stamps only had a minimal cash value of a few mils (thousandths of a dollar) individually, but when a customer accumulated a number of them, they could be exchanged with the trading stamp company (usually a third-party issuer of the stamps) for premiums, such as toys, personal items, housewares, furniture and appliances. In Hong Kong, trading stamp programs continue to operate.

==History==

=== Origin ===
The practice of retailers issuing trading stamps started in 1891 at Schuster&#x27;s Department Store, Wisconsin. At first, the stamps were given only to customers who paid for purchases in cash as a reward for not making purchases on credit. Other retailers soon copied the practice of giving trading stamps that could be redeemed at the issuer&#x27;s store. One example was L. H. Parke Company a Philadelphia and Pittsburgh manufacturer and distributor of food products that included coffee, tea and spices along with canned goods. They established a trading stamp program in 1895 under the name Parke&#x27;s Blue Point Trading Stamps for customers who purchased Parke&#x27;s products in grocery stores in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The program was successful. Parke established showrooms in their headquarters buildings in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh where customers could inspect and obtain premium goods.

=== Independent trading stamp companies ===
In 1896 the Sperry and Hutchinson Company was created as an independent trading stamp company in the United States. By 1957 there were approximately 200 trading stamp companies in operation. Typically, merchants would pay a third-party trading stamp company for the stamps, and would then advertise that they give trading stamps with purchases. Large retailers were usually given a discount on the stamps while smaller retailers generally had to pay the full cost of adopting the trading stamp program. The intent was to get customers to be loyal to the merchant, so that they would continue shopping there to obtain enough stamps to redeem for merchandise. Customers would fill books with stamps, and take the books to a trading stamp company redemption center to exchange them for premiums. Books could also be sent to the trading stamp company in exchange for premium merchandise via mail order catalogs. An example of the value of trading stamps would be during the 1970s and 1980s where the typical rate issued by a merchant was one stamp for each 10¢ of merchandise purchased. A typical book took approximately 1200 stamps to fill, or the equivalent of US $120.00 in purchases.

While one of the most popular brand of trading stamps in the US were S&amp;H Green Stamps, informally known as &quot;green stamps&quot;, other large brands included Top Value Stamps, Gold Bond Stamps, Plaid Stamps, Blue Chip Stamps, Quality Stamps, Buccaneer Stamps and Gold Strike Stamps. Texas Gold Stamps were given in Texas mainly by the H-E-B grocery store chain, and Mahalo stamps in Hawaii.

Even the comic-book publisher Marvel Comics entered the trading stamp field in the 1970s, with what were known as &quot;Marvel Value Stamps&quot;. Each Value Stamp featured artwork of a Marvel character (the first one featuring Spider-Man), and were generally featured in the letter pages of Marvel titles (with certain titles, primarily reprints, consequently not offering Value Stamps). Buyers were encouraged to clip out the stamps and collect them (this practice was annoying to future comic collectors, with the price of comics declining if they were cut up for their Value Stamps), with Marvel offering a stamp book by mail for 50 cents; if a person managed to collect all 100 stamps in a book (the 100th Stamp was kept a mystery until it was featured in &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #72, featuring the image of Galactus), they were entitled to discounts at comic book shops and conventions (including San Diego Comic-Con). A further series of stamps were released known as &quot;Series B&quot;, which in lieu of singular stamps featuring only one character, were instead akin to a jigsaw puzzle; when put together, the stamps would create an entire image, typically of a Marvel star (or in one case, Stan Lee himself). The concept was revived in 2006 for a run of stamps in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot;, and again in 2017 as part of the &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot; initiative.

==== Growth and decline ====

The use of trading stamps grew with the spread of chain gasoline stations in the early 1910s and the then-new industry of chain supermarkets in the 1920s. Merchants found it more profitable to award them to all customers rather than cash only customers. Legal challenges regarding the use of trading stamps were raised in various jurisdictions around the US but were often struck down. Some merchant groups disliked trading stamps and actively worked to have them banned in their areas. Following WWII the use of trading stamps expanded when supermarkets began issuing them. By 1957 it was estimated that nearly 250,000 retail outlets were issuing trading stamps, with nearly two thirds of US households saving trading stamps. During this time trading stamp companies had between 1,400 - 1,600 retail centers where consumers could redeem their stamps for consumer goods. In the early 1960s, the S&amp;H Green Stamps company boasted that it printed more stamps annually than the number of postage stamps printed by the US government. In 1968 it was reported that more than $900 million in stamps were sold in the United States.

Beginning in the early 1970s the use of trading stamps began to decline. Gasoline service stations stopped offering them due to the energy crisis that occurred and many supermarkets started spending more money to advertise lower prices rather than issue stamps. During the 1980s there was a brief resurgence in the popularity of trading stamps, but overall their use continued to decline. Their role has been replaced by coupons, rewards programs offered by credit card companies and other loyalty programs such as grocery &quot;Preferred Customer&quot; cards. Through the 1990s and early 2000s the majority of the remaining trading stamp companies either ceased operations or converted to an online format. In 2008 the last operating trading stamp company in the United States, Eagle Stamps, closed.

===Outside the United States===
==== Canada ====
The use of trading stamps began in Canada circa 1900 but their use was banned by the Canadian government in 1905. In 1959 the grocery chain Loblaws introduced their Lucky Green Stamps program and a trading stamp program was started by an IGA grocery store in Winnipeg. Although faced with legal challenges the use of trading stamps in these instances was upheld as legal since they did not meet the definition of trading stamps in the Canadian Criminal Code. The Criminal Code provisions against trading stamps were deleted, among other obsolete provisions, by Bill C-51 in 2018 during the 42nd Canadian Parliament

==== United Kingdom ====
By the 1960s the use of trading stamps had spread to the United Kingdom. Entrepreneur Richard Tompkins established Green Shield Stamps in the United Kingdom. Although based along a similar model, the Green Shield Stamps were independent of S&amp;H Green Stamps but carried a similar trademark. Tompkins&#x27; company began selling stamps to filling stations, small retailers and had signed up the Tesco supermarket chain to the Green Shield Stamp franchise in 1963.
The S&amp;H Company began offering their stamps in the United Kingdom as well but with the color changed to pink. In 1965, the British co-operative movement began offering trading stamps as a new means of allocating patronage dividends to its consumer members.

<text>Pin Point is an unincorporated community in Chatham County, Georgia, United States; it is located southeast of Savannah and is part of the Savannah Metropolitan Statistical Area. Pin Point is wide and long, and lies 13 feet above sea level. The town is best known for its longstanding Gullah-speaking community, and being the birthplace of U.S. Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas.

A rural settlement founded by freed people after the abolishment of slavery post-Civil War, it was settled in the 1890s by people from nearby Ossabaw, Green, and Skidaway Islands. In 1897, they founded Sweetfield of Eden Baptist Church. In 1926, as part of a school-building initiative for African American children in the South—who at the time only had access to underfunded, segregated schools—a Rosenwald school was built in the Pin Point community.

The town lies on the edge of Shipyard Creek, a branch of the Moon River. The surrounding land has large oak trees and coastal marshes, as well as crab and oyster habitats. The main employer in the community was crab and oyster canning from the 1920s through the 1980s.

Pin Point remains a small, predominantly African American community that has a well-established Gullah community. The Gullah people have been able to preserve many cultural connections to their origins in West Africa, where many of their ancestors were captured and then enslaved in the United States.

Gullah, the only English-based, Afro-Indigenous creole language in the United States, is spoken in Pin Point. It is unknown how many native speakers there are in the town, but along the Southeastern seaboard there are about 5,000 semi-speakers and 300 native speakers. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is a native speaker of Gullah (then called Geechee). He has attributed his silence on the Supreme Court to his self-consciousness speaking in an all-white school as a teenager, where classmates made fun of him for not speaking “standard English.” Pin Point Heritage Museum, once the Varn and Sons Oyster and Crab Canning Factory, is devoted to the Gullah/Geechee culture and community.

==Education==
Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools is the school district for all of Chatham County.

<doc id="338418" wikidata="Q2200026" url="?curid=338418" title="Rothschild">
<text>Rothschild () is a name derived from the German &quot;zum rothen Schild&quot; (with the old spelling &quot;th&quot;), meaning &quot;to the red shield&quot;, in reference to the houses where these family members lived or had lived. At the time, houses were designated by signs with different symbols or colors, not numbers. The name &quot;Rothschild&quot; in Yiddish means &quot;red coat&quot; (coat as in heraldic coat of arms). The Rothschild banking family&#x27;s coat of arms features in the center of its heraldry a red shield.

==People==

The most notable family of people with this surname are descendants of Mayer Amschel Rothschild who formed a financial dynasty and, in modern history, perhaps the wealthiest family by the scale of their private fortune.

In Denmark, by royal decree of 29 March 1814, all Danish Jews were obliged to adopt a surname after their town of residence. In the records, one family with residence in Roskilde took the name Rothschild, presumably because of the German pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name. The wife of writer Meïr Aron Goldschmidt, Lea Rothschild (born 1801), was of that family. There are no indications that the Rothschilds of Roskilde had any relation with the other Rothschild families.

The name is also carried by others, mostly Ashkenazi Jews, who are not related to members of the banking family.

<text>Arthur Kenneth Chesterton (1 May 1899 – 16 August 1973) was a British journalist and political activist. From 1933 to 1938, he was a member of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Disillusioned with Oswald Mosley, he left the BUF in 1938. Chesterton established the League of Empire Loyalists in 1954, which merged with a short-lived British National Party in 1967 to become the National Front. He founded and edited the magazine &quot;Candour&quot; in 1954 as the successor of &quot;Truth&quot;, of which he had been co-editor.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Arthur Kenneth Chesterton was born on 1 May 1899 in Krugersdorp, South African Republic, the son of Arthur George Chesterton (1871–1900), a secretary at the local gold mine, and Harriet Ethel Chesterton (née Down). He was the first cousin once removed of the author and poet G. K. Chesterton and the journalist Cecil Chesterton, his paternal grandfather being an older brother of G. K. and Cecil&#x27;s father Edward. The young A. K. held his two cousins in high regard, seeing Cecil as his &quot;exemplar&quot;.

Just after the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, Chesterton and his mother were sent to England. His father later died of pneumonia at 28 on his journey to join the family. In May 1902, after the end of the conflict, Chesterton returned to Krugersdorp with his paternal uncle and his mother. His mother soon married a Scottish mine administrator named George Horne, and the reconstituted family settled in Witwatersrand, near Johannesburg. In 1911, aged 12, Chesterton was sent again to England to live with his paternal grandfather in Herne Hill. He attended Dulwich College and Berkhamsted School, Hertfordshire, where he was a schoolmate of Ben Greene and Rex Tremlett.

=== World War I ===
In October 1915, Chesterton&#x27;s mother and step-father visited him in England, and he persuaded them to bring him back to South Africa. Shortly after disembarking, Chesterton decided to join the army, but too young to enlist at 16, he falsified his age to enroll in the 5th South African Light Infantry to fight in German East Africa. In his memoirs, Chesterton alluded to two battles against the Germans at Salaita Hill on 12 February 1916, and at Latema Nek on 11–12 March 1916. During a march in 1916, Chesterton collapsed from fever and was left on the roadside to die. He was eventually rescued by two African porters and sent home to his family in Johannesburg.

After a period of convalescence, then aged 17, Chesterton decided to join the army again and went to Ireland to train as an officer with a cadet battalion. In August 1918, he received his commission as second lieutenant and was transferred to the 2/2 Battalion, City of London Regiment, Royal Fusiliers. Chesterton served over two years on the Western Front. At the end of the war, he was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during the battle of Épehy on 18–19 September 1918. Chesterton was at the head of a platoon reinforcing an assault against a German position near the village of Pezières in northern France. The full citation for the award appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in July 1919, by which time the war had been over for eight months, and reads as follows:

After the end of the war, Chesterton suffered from chronic symptoms of malaria and dysentery lingered from the East African campaign, and from permanent respiratory issues caused by a gas attack in Europe. Like many veterans, he developed an addiction to alcohol, punctuated by &quot;nervous breakdowns&quot; and episodes of &quot;neurasthenia&quot;. Traumatised by trench warfare, Chesterton wrote that he had recurring nightmares of dead bodies and wrote that he began to experience the world as &quot;one vast necropolis&quot;.

=== Career as a journalist ===
Shortly before his 21st birthday in 1919, Chesterton moved back to South Africa, where he worked as a journalist for &quot;The Johannesburg Star&quot;. In 1924 he returned to England and, under the tutelage of G. Wilson Knight, Chesterton developed a reputation as a Shakespearean critic. He secured a job as a journalist and festival critic at the &quot;Stratford-upon-Avon Herald&quot;, then as a public relation officer at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. In 1928, he edited the short-lived monthly &quot;Shakespearean Review&quot;, where he developed his ideas about cultural decay.

In 1929 Chesterton met his future wife, Doris Terry, a schoolteacher from Torquay. The couple married in 1933 and moved to Kingston upon Thames. Doris was a Fabian socialist and did not share her husband&#x27;s later political views.

Between 1929 and 1931, he worked as a journalist for the &quot;Torquay Times&quot;, and served as the chairman of the South Devon branch of the National Union of Journalists. In November 1933 Chesterton joined the British Union of Fascists (BUF) while still employed by the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, after being recruited by Rex Tremlett, his former schoolmate at Berkhamsted and then the editor of BUF&#x27;s newspapers &quot;Fascist Week&quot; and &quot;The Blackshirt&quot;.

=== British Union of Fascists ===

Six months after joining the BUF, Chesterton was appointed officer-in-charge of Warwickshire and Staffordshire, and in April 1934 officer-in-charge of the &quot;Midlands Area&quot; for the party. Oswald Mosley, the leader of the BUF, later appointed him Director of Press Propaganda, a subsection of the BUF Propaganda Department, and in March 1935 to the BUF &quot;Research Directory&quot;, the &quot;inner circle&quot; of the party&#x27;s strategists. During the spring of 1935, Chesterton started to drink again. He was said to frequently arrive at BUF headquarters &quot;in a drunken state&quot;, and some members began to call for his expulsion. In July, &quot;Blackshirt&quot; euphemistically reported that Chesterston was &quot;having a well-deserved rest, on the strict orders of his doctor.&quot; Mosley eventually paid for Chesterton to be treated by a neurologist in Germany.

Following his return to Britain in April 1937, Chesterton was appointed in June &quot;Director of Publicity and Propaganda&quot;, and in August the editor of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Blackshirt&quot;. This position provided a pulpit for his increasingly &quot;vituperative&quot; anti-Semitic rhetoric, the magazine promoting &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; as &quot;the most astounding book ever published&quot;. Chesterton also wrote the officially sanctioned biography of Mosley entitled &quot;Oswald Mosley: Portrait of a Leader&quot; (1937), in fact a hagiography of Mosley in which Chesterton claims that the BUF leader had an &quot;unconquerable spirit, with its grandeur of courage and resolve&quot;, closing the book with the salutation &quot;Hail, Mosley, patriot, revolutionary and leader of men!&quot;

=== World War II ===
In the late 1930s Chesterton became gradually disillusioned with the myth of &quot;The Leader&quot; and came to lose confidence in Mosley after 1937. On 18 March 1938, he resigned from the BUF; Mosley soon had his memory erased from the history of the party. The same year, Chesterton attended a meeting of the National Socialist League (NSL). The NSL published his pamphlet &quot;Why I left Mosley&quot; in 1938, although Chesterton never joined the organisation. He became involved with the short-lived British Council against European Commitments (BCAE), an anti-Bolshevik movement which had emerged during the Munich crisis to resist war with Germany, and he contributed to Lord Lymington&#x27;s journal &quot;New Pioneer&quot;.

In June 1939, Chesterton established his own group, British Vigil. He regularly spoke at meetings of the Nordic League, and became involved with the Right Club, a secretive organization founded in May 1939 to consolidate existing right-wing British organizations into a unified body. Archibald Ramsay, founder of the Right Club, explained its ideology and purpose:
: &quot;The main object of the Right Club was to oppose and expose the activities of Organized Jewry, in the light of the evidence which came into my possession in 1938. Our first objective was to clear the Conservative Party of Jewish influence, and the character of our membership and meetings were strictly in keeping with this objective.&quot;

In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, Chesterton re-enlisted in the British Army and served in Kenya and Somaliland. He relapsed into alcoholism and relinquished his commission on grounds of ill health in the spring of 1943. Upon his return to Britain, he set up the short-lived National Front after Victory (NF after V) and was involved with the relaunched British Peoples Party.

Chesterton applied for work at the BBC, but MI5 intervened to ensure that he could not be employed. He found work in sub-editing at the &quot;Sheffield Evening Telegraph&quot;, but was forced to resign due to a bout of malaria. Afterwards, he worked for the &quot;Southport Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Liverpool&quot; &quot;Evening Express&quot;, and partly as a freelance journalist to supplement his living, including for &quot;The Weekly Review&quot;. In August 1943, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; published an attack on Chesterton accusing him of treachery for his past association with William Joyce. Chesterton sued the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; and &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, which had repeated the accusation, for libel. The case was dropped for lack of funds, but Chesterton did manage to elicit an apology. In September 1944, he was appointed deputy editor of &quot;Truth&quot;.

=== Post-war activism ===
In February 1945 Chesterton helped establish the National Front, a coalition of underground minor fascist groups with policies including the safeguarding of a strong &quot;national and Empire economy&quot;, preserving Christian traditions and finding &quot;an honourable, just and lasting solution&quot; to the &quot;real Jewish problem&quot;. The movement was headed first by Collin Brooks then by Chesterton.

From 1950 to 1958, Chesterton authored a reoccurring article titled &quot;The International Situation&quot; for every issue of &quot;The Journal of the Royal United Services Institution&quot;, nowadays often known as the &quot;RUSI Journal&quot;.

Chesterton became literary advisor to Lord Beaverbrook, who offered him jobs at &quot;The Daily Express&quot; and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. Chesterton ghostwrote his autobiography &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust To Luck&quot; (1954). In October 1953, whilst still in Beaverbrook&#x27;s employ, Chesterton founded the magazine &quot;Candour&quot;, which is still published today, though increasingly erratically as of 2012. He has claimed that Beaverbrook sacked him upon learning of &quot;Candour&quot;&#x27;s existence; in fact, his contract expired in January 1954 and was not renewed.

Following the collapse of the National Front due to infighting, Chesterton founded in 1954 the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL), a political pressure group which gathered many future far-right leaders the likes of Colin Jordan, John Bean, John Tyndall, or Martin Webster. The movement was publicly known in the 1950s for its political stunts, especially in interrupting Conservative conferences while chanting &quot;Save the Empire&quot; and &quot;Tory Traitors&quot;.

=== 1960s ===
In July 1965, Chesterton published &quot;The New Unhappy Lords&quot;, a self-described study of the &quot;power elites&quot; which takes the form, in the words of scholar Graham Macklin, of an &quot;elegantly written antisemitic tirade on the subversive and occult conspiracy against the British Empire, and Western civilisation in general, that he believed was striving behind the scenes to create a &#x27;One-World&#x27; Jewish super-state.&quot; Following the demise of Nazi Germany for its &quot;revolt against the Money Power&quot;, Chesterton argued that the British Empire and Commonwealth were then the decisive impediment to the global money-power conspiracy, mainly thanks to their system of Imperial preference.&#x27; The book received damning reviews in the mainstream media, but it had sold in excess of 17,000 copies by June 1969. Along with Phyllis Schlafly&#x27;s &quot;A Choice Not an Echo,&quot; published one year earlier, the book was one of the first to highlight the Bilderberg Group as a decisive actor in global conspiracy theories.&#x27;

After failing to make gains in the 1966 general election, Chesterton founded in February 1967 a second National Front (NF); he was elected the party&#x27;s first chairman and remained its Policy Director until 1970. The National Front brought together the LEL and British National Party. A faction of the Racial Preservation Society decided to join them, but radicals and openly neo-Nazis figures like Jordan, Tyndall or Webster were excluded to avoid public backlash. In June 1967, however, Chesterton eventually welcomed Tyndall and members of the Greater Britain Movement (GBM) into the party.

=== Later life and death ===
At the end of his life, Chesterton became increasingly ill from the emphysema he had contracted in the gas attack during World War I, living part-time in his native South Africa. While Chesterton was holidaying in South Africa, a faction led by Gordon Brown—formerly of Tyndall&#x27;s GBM—launched a leadership challenge against him. On realising that his support was weak, Chesterton resigned in 1970.

Chesterton spent the remainder of his days editing &quot;Candour&quot; until his death from emphysema on 16 August 1973, aged 74.

== Views ==
According to historian Richard Thurlow, Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;weird mixture of racism, ethnocentrism and conspiracy theory in its racial theory and its paternalism, monarchism (particularly reverence for Edward I who expelled the Jews), cultural pessimism, Social Darwinism and dialectical mode of argument in its political theory are more akin to patterns of thought prevalent in pre-Nazi German Conservatism than to any English equivalent.&quot;

After the war, Chesterton repudiated fascism and resolutely denied accusations to the effect that he was pursuing a &quot;neo-fascist&quot; agenda. He toned down the antisemitic imagery of his pre-war writings, although the Jews remained at the centre of his conspiracy theories. Described as &quot;far more parasitic and corrupt than any baby could conceive&quot; in &quot;Blackshirt&quot; (1935), they were still &quot;the principal promoters of the idea of integrating peoples of disparate racial stocks&quot; in his 1965 book &quot;The New Unhappy Lords&quot;.

Although he conceded in 1973 that &quot;any competent Jewish writer can make a nonsense of attempts to prove their authenticity&quot;, Chesterton regarded &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a Tsarist antisemitic forgery, as a &quot;masterly analysis of the weaknesses of Gentile society&quot; in &quot;The New Happy Lord&quot; (1965). In his later life, he came to consider the use of crude antisemitism a &quot;liability and a menace&quot; to the nationalist movement. Chesterton launched in September 1970 a public attack on anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist Eustace Mullins in &quot;Candour&quot;, under the title &quot;This man is dangerous&quot;.

== Influence ==
John Tyndall, who established the British National Party (BNP) in 1982, has declared in 1971, &quot;Without hesitation, what understanding I have of political affairs I have I owe much more to A.K. than any other person&quot;; Tyndall kept on recommending Chesterton&#x27;s writings until his death in July 2005. Martin Webster, the National Front national activities organiser from 1969 to 1983, stressed in 2009 the &quot;tremendous impact&quot; of the intellectual framework provided by Chesterton book &quot;The New Happy Lord&quot; &quot;because it tied together the threads of what is happening, why and who&#x27;s doing it&quot;. Chesterton was also a long-time friend of Revilo P. Oliver; they regularly wrote to each other until Chesterton&#x27;s death in 1973.

==Works==
Chesterton&#x27;s works (including some previously only published within &quot;Candour&quot; magazine) have been re-edited by the A. K. Chesterton Trust from 2013 onward. In 1945, Chesterton penned an anti-Labour satire under the pseudonym Caius Marcius Coriolanus, the name of Shakespeare&#x27;s Roman tragedy, published by writer and British Housewives League member Dorothy Crisp.

<text>The term cavalry wing in military history was used to refer to the cavalry units positioned on either of the army flanks when deployed for battle. 

In ancient Greece, one of the standard battle tactics of the Macedonian army was to have a fast-moving cavalry wing outflank the enemy to the right and encircle them, drawing them in toward the army&#x27;s slower-moving infantry phalanx. Alexander the Great led the right cavalry wing in the Battle of tne Granicus. 

The British Army, also referred to as The British Cavalry Wing was an administrative division of the army that grouped horse-mounted cavalry units until amalgamation with the Royal Tank Corps on 4 April 1939 to create the Royal Armoured Corps.

The Romans used the term Ala, meaning wing, to denote their major cavalry units.

<doc id="338427" wikidata="Q88556" url="?curid=338427" title="Garrison">
<text>A garrison (from the French &quot;garnison&quot;, itself from the verb &quot;garnir&quot;, &quot;to equip&quot;) is any body of troops stationed in a particular location, originally to guard it. The term now often applies to certain facilities that constitute a military base or fortified military headquarters.
A garrison is usually in a city, town, fort, castle, ship, or similar site. &quot;Garrison town&quot; is a common expression for any town that has a military base nearby.

&quot;Garrison towns&quot; () were used during the Arab Islamic conquests of Middle Eastern lands by Arab-Muslim armies to increase their dominance over indigenous populations. In order to occupy non-Arab, non-Islamic areas, nomadic Arab tribesmen were taken from the desert by the ruling Arab elite, conscripted into Islamic armies, and settled into garrison towns as well as given a share in the spoils of war. The primary utility of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was to control the indigenous non-Arab peoples of these conquered and occupied territories, and to serve as garrison bases to launch further Islamic military campaigns into yet-undominated lands. A secondary aspect of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was the uprooting of the aforementioned nomadic Arab tribesmen from their original home regions in the Arabian Peninsula in order to proactively avert these tribal peoples, and particularly their young men, from revolting against the Islamic state established in their midst.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Garrison&quot; also specifically refers to any of the major military stations such as Aldershot, Catterick, Colchester, Tidworth, Bulford, and London, which have more than one barracks or camp and their own military headquarters, usually commanded by a colonel, brigadier or major-general, assisted by a garrison sergeant major. In Ireland, Association football (as distinct from Gaelic football) has historically been termed the &quot;garrison game&quot; or the &quot;garrison sport&quot; for its connections with British military serving in Irish cities and towns.

In 18th-century Newfoundland and Labrador, garrisons served as important components of colonial life. Some garrisons reached a peak of 300 men during the French and Indian War. In times of peace, only a few dozen soldiers would staff the garrison.

<doc id="338435" wikidata="Q6000508" url="?curid=338435" title="Filicide">
<text>Filicide is the deliberate act of a parent killing their own child. The word &quot;filicide&quot; is derived from the Latin words and (&#x27;son&#x27; and &#x27;daughter&#x27;) and the suffix &quot;-cide&quot;, from the word meaning &#x27;to kill&#x27;. The word can refer to both the crime and perpetrator of the crime.

==Statistics==
A 1999 U.S. Department of Justice study concluded that mothers were responsible for a higher share of children killed during infancy between 1976 and 1997 in the United States, while fathers were more likely to have been responsible for the murders of children aged eight or older. Parents were responsible for 61% of child murders under the age of five. Sometimes, there is a combination of murder and suicide in filicide cases. On average, according to FBI statistics, 450 children are murdered by their parents each year in the United States.

An in-depth longitudinal study of 297 cases convicted of filicide and 45 of filicide-suicide in the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2006 showed that 37% of the perpetrators had a recorded mental illness at the time. The most common diagnoses were mood disorders and personality disorders rather than psychosis, but the latter accounted for 15% of cases. However – similar to findings in a large Danish study – the majority had not had contact with mental health services prior to the murders, and few had received treatment. Female perpetrators were more likely to have given birth as teenagers. Fathers were more likely to have been convicted of violent offences and have a history of substance misuse, and were more likely to kill multiple victims. Infants were more likely to be victims than older children, and a link to post-partum depression was suggested.

== Types of filicide ==
Dr. Phillip Resnick published research on filicide in 1969 and stated that there were five main motives for filicide, including &quot;altruistic&quot;, &quot;fatal maltreatment&quot;, &quot;unwanted child&quot;, &quot;acutely psychotic&quot; and &quot;spousal revenge&quot;. &quot;Altruistic&quot; killings occur because the parent believes that the world is too cruel for the child, or because the child is enduring suffering (whether this is actually occurring or not). In fatal maltreatment killings, the goal is not always to kill the child, but death may occur anyway, and Munchausen syndrome by proxy is in that category. Spousal revenge killings are killings of children done to indirectly harm a domestic partner; they do not frequently occur. Glen Carruthers, author of &quot;Making sense of spousal revenge filicide&quot;, argued that those who engage in spousal revenge killings see their own children as objects.

== Children at risk ==
In 2013, in the United States, homicide was in the top five causes of deaths of children, and in the top three causes of death in children between 1 and 4 years old. A direct correlation has been identified between child abuse rates and child homicide rates. Research suggests that children murdered by their parents were physically abused by them prior to their death.

In South Asia and the Middle East, many homicide cases were due to parents killing their children after being accused of violating the family&#x27;s reputation; daughters were most likely to be murdered in these killings.

<text>The Library of Living Philosophers is a series of books conceived of and started by Paul Arthur Schilpp in 1939; Schilpp remained editor until 1981. The series has since been edited by Lewis Edwin Hahn (1981–2001), Randall Auxier (2001–2013), and Douglas R. Anderson (2013–2015). The &quot;Library of Living Philosophers&quot; is currently edited by Sarah Beardsworth (2015-present). Each volume is devoted to a single living philosopher of note, and contains, alongside an &quot;intellectual autobiography&quot; of its subject and a complete bibliography, a collection of critical and interpretive essays by several dozen contemporary philosophers on aspects of the subject&#x27;s work, with responses by the subject. The Library was originally conceived as a means by which a philosopher could reply to their interpreters while still alive, hopefully resolving endless philosophical disputes about what someone &quot;really meant.&quot; While its success in this line has been questionable—a reply, after all, can stand just as much in need of interpretation as an original essay—the series has become a noted philosophical resource and the site of much significant contemporary argument.

The series was published by Northwestern University from its inception through 1949; by Tudor Publishing Co. from 1952 to 1959; and since then by Open Court. The series is owned by Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

<text>South Kensington is a London Underground station in the district of South Kensington, south west London. It is served by three lines: Circle, District and Piccadilly. On the Circle and District lines the station is between Gloucester Road and Sloane Square stations, and on the Piccadilly line it is between Gloucester Road and Knightsbridge stations. The station is located in Travelcard Zone 1. The main station entrance is located at the junction of Old Brompton Road (A3218), Thurloe Place, Harrington Road, Onslow Place and Pelham Street. Subsidiary entrances are located in Exhibition Road giving access by pedestrian tunnel to the Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert Museums. Also close by are the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College London, the Royal College of Music, the London branch of the Goethe-Institut and the Ismaili Centre.

The station is in two parts: sub-surface platforms opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway and the District Railway as part of the companies&#x27; extension of the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; route eastwards from Gloucester Road to Westminster and deep level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, which have been modified several times to suit operational demands with the current arrangement being achieved in the 1960s. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered, although the installation of escalators in the 1970s to replace lifts improved interchanges between the two parts of the station. Parts of the sub-surface station and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed.

==History==

===Sub-surface station===
The station was opened on 24 December 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) and the District Railway (DR, later the District line). The MR had previously opened an extension from Paddington (Praed Street) (now Paddington) to Gloucester Road on 1 October 1868 and opened tracks to South Kensington to connect to the DR when the DR opened the first section of its line to Westminster. The original South Kensington station, designed by the MR&#x27;s engineer John Fowler, had two platforms although it was intended that this would be supplemented as DR services extended.
On 1 August 1870, the DR opened additional tracks between Gloucester Road and South Kensington. On 10 July 1871, the DR opened its own facilities at South Kensington. The enlarged station had two through platforms for each company and a bay platform for terminating MR trains from the west. The junction between the two companies&#x27; tracks was also moved from the west side of the station to the east side.

On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl&#x27;s Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London Line) at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the DR&#x27;s tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London Line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House – at that time the eastern terminus of the DR.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operations through South Kensington, running from Moorgate along the MR&#x27;s tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&amp;CR and the DR.

On 4 May 1885, the District Railway opened South Kensington Subway, a pedestrian subway (a tiled tunnel), running from the station beneath the length of Exhibition Road, giving sheltered access to the newly built museums for a toll of 1 penny. The subway was originally intended to go as far as the Royal Albert Hall, but the construction of the Imperial Institute meant the tunnel emerged at the Science Museum where it exits onto Exhibition Road. Although it had cost £42,614 to construct (approximately £ today), it was closed on 10 November 1886 and afterwards was opened only occasionally for special museum events. Originally only opened during exhibitions in South Kensington, it was opened to the public free of charge in 1908. The subway is Grade II listed.

In 1890, the South Kensington and Paddington Subway (SK&amp;PS), a proposed cut-and-cover railway planned to run from South Kensington to Paddington station, offered to purchase the under-used pedestrian subway for use as the first section of its tunnel. At wide and high the subway could have accommodated two tracks without difficulty, but the SK&amp;PS&#x27;s controversial plan to excavate a trench across Hyde Park was opposed and the railway withdrew its private bill from Parliament in March 1891. The DR continued to open the subway intermittently and charged a toll until 1908, when it was opened permanently for free. On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House, and, on 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was also shortened to terminate at Earl&#x27;s Court. In 1907, the station reopened to designs by George Campbell Sherrin, including a new art deco entrance with an arcade and a new ticket hall, with canopies added to the platforms replacing the two trainsheds erected in 1868 and 1871.

In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the reversing bay track was taken out of use and the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) were taken out of use in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to be provided to the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During service disruption or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures.

Over the decades, there were also a number of aborted attempts to build above the station with hotels, offices and a shopping mall proposed at times. None were built.
===Deep-level station===
By the beginning of the 20th century, the DR had been extended to Richmond, Ealing Broadway, Hounslow West and Wimbledon in the west and to New Cross Gate in the east. The southern section of the Inner Circle was suffering considerable congestion between South Kensington and Mansion House, between which stations the DR was running an average of 20 trains per hour with more in the peak periods.

To relieve the congestion, the DR planned an express deep-level tube line starting from a connection to its sub-surface tracks west of Gloucester Road and running to Mansion House. The tunnels were planned to run about beneath the existing sub-surface route with only one intermediate stop at Charing Cross (now Embankment). Parliamentary approval was obtained in 1897 but no work was done. In 1898, the DR took over the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&amp;PCR) which had a route planned from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. The route was modified to join the DR deep-level route at South Kensington.

Following the purchase of the DR by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London in 1902, the planned DR and B&amp;PCR lines were merged with a third proposed route from the Great Northern and Strand Railway. The DR deep-level route was revised at its western end to continue to Earl&#x27;s Court and surface to the east of Barons Court.

The deep-level platforms were opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR, now the Piccadilly line) which ran between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith. The platforms are placed eastbound above westbound and were originally served by lifts from street level stopping at both platform levels. Eastbound GNP&amp;BR trains and DR trains would have shared the same platform with the two routes separating at a junction immediately to the east of the station. Westbound trains would have had separate platforms at the lower level with the routes merging at a junction west of the station. Although construction of the section of the DR tube route east of South Kensington had been postponed, a partial, long, section of the westbound DR platform was built along with the two for GNP&amp;BR use. Though closed-off from the rest of the station, it was linked to the lift lobby and was tiled to match the other platforms. Enlarged tunnel sections for the junctions were constructed with the original running tunnels and remain visible from passing trains. A new surface building on Pelham Street for the lifts was designed by Leslie Green with the GNP&amp;BR&#x27;s distinctive ox-blood red glazed terracotta façade.

The unused westbound tunnel was used during World War I to store art from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and china from Buckingham Palace and, from 1927 to 1939, was used as a signalling school. During World War II it contained equipment to detect bombs falling in the River Thames which might require the emergency floodgates on the under-river tunnels to be closed.

In the early 1970s the lifts to the Piccadilly line platforms were replaced by escalators, with one pair being provided between the ticket hall and a new intermediate level, where it met a linking passageway to the Circle and District line platforms, and three being provided from there to a lower concourse between the levels of the two Piccadilly line platforms. Stairs up and down from the lower concourse connect to the platforms. The stairs and passage to the westbound platform are located in the disused DR westbound platform tunnel. With the introduction of escalators, the GNP&amp;BR station building was taken out of use.

In February 2021, access to the Piccadilly line was closed in order to replace the escalators. The work was completed by June 2022.

==Future proposals==
Many stations on the Circle line which were originally constructed in open cuttings have been subject to air-rights developments where cuttings have been roofed over with buildings built above. South Kensington station and the adjacent shop premises occupy a site of approximately and proposals for redevelopment of the station and the site have been made a number of times since 1989 without success.
In December 2016, Transport for London published outline proposals prepared by architects BuckleyGrayYeoman for a redevelopment of the buildings to the west of the station arcade and in Thurloe Street and space to the south of the station cutting on Pelham Street. The proposal includes bringing the disused northern platform back into use for eastbound trains, a new entrance to Thurloe Street, a reconfigured ticket hall and provision of step-free access throughout the station. On 12 December 2023, the Planning Inspectorate upheld the bulk of an appeal against the refusal of planning consent and the redevelopment can proceed.

==Services==

The station is in Travelcard Zone 1. On the District and Circle lines, the station is between Gloucester Road and Sloane Square, and on the Piccadilly line, it is between Gloucester Road and Knightsbridge. South Kensington is the easternmost interchange between these three lines. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally District line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:15 to 00:30 eastbound and 05:45 to 00:45 westbound; they are supplemented by Circle line trains every 8–12 minutes from approximately 05:30 to 00:30 clockwise and 05:40 to 00:15 anticlockwise. Piccadilly line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:40 to 00:25 eastbound and 05:50 to 00:40 westbound.

On the Piccadilly line 1973 Stock is used. On the Circle and District lines S Stock is used.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 14, 49, 70, 74, 345, 360, 430 and C1 and night routes N74 and N97 serve the station.
There is a Santander Cycles rental station north of the station in Thurlow Street.

==In literature==
South Kensington is one of two tube stations (the other being Sloane Square) mentioned in the song &quot;When you&#x27;re lying awake&quot; from the operetta &quot;Iolanthe&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan.

<doc id="338450" wikidata="Q7214" url="?curid=338450" title="Emperor Hui of Han">
<text>Emperor Hui of Han (; 210 BC – 26 September 188 BC), born Liu Ying (), was the second emperor of the Han dynasty. He was the second son of Emperor Gaozu, the first Han emperor, and the only son of Empress Lü from the powerful Lü clan. Emperor Hui is generally remembered as a somewhat weak character dominated and terrorized by his mother, Empress Lü, who became Empress Dowager after she encouraged her husband to command personally the war against Ying Bu, in which he died eventually from an arrow wound sustained during the war.

Huidi was personally kind and well-intentioned, simple, hesitant, soft-hearted and generous, unable to escape the impact of his mother&#x27;s viciousness. He tried to protect his younger half-brother Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao from being murdered by Empress Dowager Lü, but failed. After that, he indulged himself in drinking and sex, gave up government affairs to his mother, and died at a relatively young age. Emperor Hui&#x27;s wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his elder sister Princess Yuan of Lu; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager Lü and was a childless one. After Emperor Hui died without a designated heir, Empress Dowager Lü installed two of his alleged sons whom she adopted into her clan, Liu Gong and Liu Hong, sons of one or more of the Emperor&#x27;s concubines. They and the rest of the Lü clan were exterminated in the wake of the ensuing Lü Clan disturbance, and Emperor Hui&#x27;s half-brother Liu Heng was established as Emperor Wen.

==Early life and years as crown prince==
===Early years===
Liu Ying was born during the Qin dynasty. Liu Ying&#x27;s childhood is not completely clear. His father Liu Bang would after Liu Ying&#x27;s birth go on to found the Han dynasty, and later given the posthumous name of Han Gaodi (emperor Gao of Han). What is known is that Liu Ying was not Liu Bang&#x27;s oldest son—that would be Liu Fei, who would later be made the Prince of Qi. However, Liu Ying was considered to be the proper heir because his mother, the later Empress Lü, was Liu Bang&#x27;s wife, while Liu Fei&#x27;s mother was either a concubine or a mistress who was with Liu Bang before he became King of Han.

===Chu–Han Contention===
During Chu–Han Contention, while Liu Bang fought a five-year war with Xiang Yu for supremacy over the Chinese world, his mother, his sister, and he did not initially follow his father to the Principality of Han (modern Sichuan, Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi); rather, they stayed in his father&#x27;s home territory, perhaps in his home town of Pei (沛縣, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) deep in Xiang&#x27;s Principality of Western Chu, presumably with his grandfather Liu Taigong.

===Father Liu&#x27;s big setback===
In 205 BC, Liu Bang appeared to be near total victory, having captured Xiang&#x27;s capital of Pengcheng. How his family received this news was unclear, but a few months later, when Xiang responded and crushed Liu&#x27;s forces, Liu fled and, in his flight, attempted to pass through his hometown to take his family with him. He was able to find his children and carry them along with him, but his father and wife were captured by Xiang&#x27;s forces and kept as hostages—and would not be returned to him until Liu and Xiang temporarily made peace in 203 BC. The then-very young Liu Ying must have then spent these days not knowing what the eventual fate of his grandfather and mother would be.

===Father Liu&#x27;s big victory===
After Liu Bang&#x27;s victory and self-declaration as the emperor (later known as Emperor Gao), thus establishing the Han dynasty, in 202 BC, he made his wife empress and Liu Ying, as his proper heir, crown prince. Thus, Liu Ying became the first crown prince in Chinese imperial history. Under the title of Ying Taizi (&quot;Crown Prince Ying&quot;), he was considered to be kind and tolerant, characteristics that Emperor Gao did not like. Rather, he favored his young son Liu Ruyi, whom he considered to be more like him and whose mother, Consort Qi, was his favorite concubine. With the support of the officials and the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang, Prince Ying&#x27;s status as heir survived despite Consort Qi&#x27;s machinations.

===Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang===
Soon after establishing the Han dynasty, the new emperor, Gaodi, was eager to recruit talented persons. In 196 BCE, Gao even issued a decree to the effect that any official knowing of a virtuous man must so report on penalty of being fired (unless they were too old or sick). Sometime before or after that, Gao attempted to obtain the services of the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang: Master Dongyuan, Qi Liji, Master Xiahuang and Mr. Lu Li. During the time of troubles which characterized the Qin dynasty, these four had entered into a life of seclusion on Mount Shang. They were old and had white hair and beards. Thus, they were known as the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang. Liu Bang was well aware of the reputation of these four sages, and when he became emperor Gao, the four refused his ardent entreaties to assume positions of importance in his newly established government. When the question of who was to be imperial heir came up, two of Gaodi&#x27;s women both advocated for their own son: Lü for Ying and Qi for her own son. Gao favored Qi&#x27;s son, as he thought the youth embodied more of his personality. Lü Hou got the advantage: she went to the powerful official Zhang Liang, who said, “His Majesty had long heard about the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang and wanted to invite them to serve the country. However, they refused. If the Crown Prince could obtain the support of the Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang, then His Majesty would not depose him.” Lü Hou then applied her forces of persuasion. The Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang showed up at court. The four agreed that according to the Confucian precepts of filial piety, as the elder son the future Huidi should succeed to the rulership. Furthermore, Liu Ying&#x27;s nature was benevolent and compassionate. Gaodi noticed the presence of four elders with white hair and white beards at his court, and inquired as to their identity. Upon finding out who they were and what their position was, Gaodi went to Lady Qi and told her: “I cannot appoint your son as the successor because the Crown Prince has already obtained the support of such capable people. His position is firmly entrenched.”

===Lü Hou: Growing ascendancy===
As crown prince, Prince Ying, along with his mother, would be the ones who would rule on important matters at the capital in his father&#x27;s absence during various campaigns. When Ying Bu rebelled in 196 BC, Emperor Gao was ill and considered sending Prince Ying as the commander of the forces against Ying Bu rather than campaigning himself, but at the suggestion of Empress Lü (who averred that the generals, who were generally Emperor Gao&#x27;s old friends, might not fully obey the young prince), went on the campaign himself. Prince Ying was instead put in charge of home territories around the capital Chang&#x27;an, assisted by Confucian scholar Shusun Tong (叔孫通) and strategist Zhang Liang (張良). He appeared to carry out the tasks competently but without distinction.

===Succession to the imperial power===
Prince Ying succeeded to the throne of Han when his father died in 195 BC from complications of an arrow wound suffered during the campaign against Ying Bu, after Lü Hou had insisted on Gaodi personally leading the fight.

==Reign as emperor under Empress Lü&#x27;s regency==

Immediately upon Prince Ying&#x27;s ascension to the throne as Emperor Hui, Empress Lü, now empress dowager, became the effective lead figure in his administration. She wanted to carry out a plot of revenge against Consort Qi and her son Ruyi. She first arrested Consort Qi and put her in prison garb (shaved head, confined by stock, and wearing red clothes). She then summoned Liu Ruyi to the capital—an attempt that was initially resisted by Ruyi&#x27;s chief of staff Zhou Chang (), whom she respected because he was one of the officials who insisted on Liu Ying being the rightful heir. Instead of directly moving against Zhou and Liu Ruyi, though, Lü circumvented Zhou by first summoning &quot;him&quot; to the capital, and then summoning Liu Ruyi.

Emperor Hui tried to save Liu Ruyi&#x27;s life. Before Liu Ruyi could get to the capital, Emperor Hui intercepted his young brother at Bashang (霸上, in modern Xi&#x27;an) and received Liu Ruyi into his palace, and they dined and slept together. Empress Dowager Lü wanted to kill Liu Ruyi, but was afraid that any attempt might also harm her own son, and therefore could not carry out her plot for several months.

Empress Dowager Lü got her chance in January 194 BC. One morning, Emperor Hui was out hunting and wanted to take Liu Ruyi with him. The young prince was then only 14 years old and refused to get up from bed, and Emperor Hui left for the hunt on his own. Empress Dowager Lü heard this and immediately sent an assassin into the emperor&#x27;s palace to force poisoned wine down the prince&#x27;s throat. By the time that Emperor Hui returned, his brother was dead. She then had Consort Qi&#x27;s eyes gouged out, made her ears deaf, drugged her to make her unable to speak and had her arms and legs cut off. The mutilated woman was thrown into a latrine and then fed and kept alive in a pig&#x27;s bin and was called the &quot;人彘&quot;, meaning literally the &quot;human swine&quot;. (She would die from the torture.) When Emperor Hui saw his father&#x27;s favorite and the mother of his beloved little brother in such a condition, he cried out loud and became depressed and sick for about a year. He told his mother that he could not govern the empire, given that he was the son of someone like her who has done such inhuman deeds. From that point, Emperor Hui only &quot;indulged himself with wine and women&quot; and no longer made major and key governing decisions, leaving them to his mother, and Empress Dowager Lü had so much power that Emperor Hui was ineffective.

Emperor Hui, however, continued to try to protect his siblings. In December 194 BC, when Liu Fei, Prince of Qi—his older half-brother—made an official visit to the capital, they both attended a feast put on by Empress Dowager Lü. Emperor Hui, honoring the prince as an older brother, asked him to take a seat at the table even more honored than his own. The empress dowager was greatly offended and instructed her servants to pour two cups of poisoned wine which were set on the table between the trio. She ordered Liu Fei to toast her, while ignoring Emperor Hui. As Liu Fei was about to drink the poisoned wine, Emperor Hui, knowing his mother&#x27;s murderously jealous temperament and remembering how his other brother had died, suddenly reached for the second cup, which the Empress did not intend. (The second cup was a decoy, placed there only to suggest to Liu Fei that she would return his toast, as ritual required, although he would die immediately on drinking his, so she would not need to drink the other cup. Her resentment toward Liu Fei fully captured her attention and she did not even think of her son&#x27;s presence.) Empress Dowager Lü jumped up and slapped the second cup away from Emperor Hui, spilling it. Liu Fei realized the trick and left, pretending to be already drunk. In the end, he was only able to leave the capital by offering to the Empress an entire commandery from his principality, to be the feudal estate of Princess Yuan of Lu. Empress Dowager Lü, who greatly loved her daughter as well, was pleased and let Liu Fei return to his principality.

===Accomplishments===
As the second emperor of his dynasty, Huidi helped to establish the Han dynasty on a strong footing: Huidi bolstered the Han dynastic aspirations by establishing shrines venerating his father throughout the land. Although his father, Gaodi, had continued many of the Qin institutions, Huidi repealed some particularly harsh Qin laws, such as the Burning of books and burying of scholars law. Nevertheless, Huidi&#x27;s gentle nature was at first little match against the ruthless Lü Hou and her clan. Still, the Han dynasty was set on a firm foot as the challenging Lü clan was eventually generally exterminated and Han Huidi was effectively succeeded by Emperor Wen of Han.

=== Hong Ru ===
Hui had a eunuch lover by the name of Hong Ru, who was favored so deeply that many officials attempted to imitate his style of dress in the hope of gaining the emperor&#x27;s attention.

==Death==
Hui died in the autumn of 188 BC of an unspecified illness. After Empress Lü&#x27;s death and the massacre of the Lü clan in 180BC, Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s officials and survivors of the imperial Liu clan then chose Liu Heng as the next emperor, deliberately due to his lack of a powerful maternal clan.

==Marriage and children==
In November 192 BC, Emperor Hui married Empress Zhang, a marriage that would not yield any children. However, whether Emperor Hui actually had children during or before his reign is a controversial question. The officials, including Chen Ping and Zhou Bo, who would later overthrow the Lü clan after the deaths of both Emperor Hui and Empress Dowager Lü, claimed that Emperor Hui had no sons—but that Empress Zhang, at Empress Dowager Lü&#x27;s instigation, stole eight boys from other people, put their mothers to death, and made the children her own. Modern historians have split opinions on the issue, but largely believe that the boys were actually Emperor Hui&#x27;s sons by concubines and that Empress Zhang did indeed put their mothers to death and make them her own children. (As, for example, Bo Yang pointed out, it would be logically incongruent, if Empress Zhang did steal these children from elsewhere, for her to put only the mothers but not the fathers to death.) Under this theory, the officials denied the imperial ancestry of these children in fear of the fact that they were also descendants of Empress Dowager Lü and her clan, and therefore might if allowed to live eventually to seek vengeance for the slaughter of the Lü clan—a reason that they themselves admitted. Except for Liu Gong (who was deposed and executed by Empress Dowager Lü), the other children either died young by natural causes or were executed by the officials after they made Liu Heng, the Prince of Dai (Emperor Wen) the emperor.

<text>An arboretum (: arboreta) is a botanical collection composed exclusively of trees and shrubs of a variety of species. Originally mostly created as a section in a larger garden or park for specimens of mostly non-local species, many modern arboreta are in botanical gardens as living collections of woody plants and are intended at least in part for scientific study.

In Latin, an &quot;arboretum&quot; is a place planted with trees, not necessarily in this specific sense, and &quot;arboretum&quot; as an English word is first recorded used by John Claudius Loudon in 1833 in &quot;The Gardener&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, but the concept was already long-established by then.
An arboretum specializing in growing conifers is known as a pinetum. Other specialist arboreta include saliceta (willows), populeta (poplar), and querceta (oaks). Related collections include a fruticetum, from the Latin &quot;frutex&quot;, meaning &quot;shrub&quot;, much more often a shrubbery, and a viticetum (from the Latin &quot;vitis,&quot; meaning vine, referring in particular to a grape vine). A palm house is a large greenhouse for palms and other tender trees.

==History==

Egyptian pharaohs planted exotic trees and cared for them; they brought ebony wood from the Sudan, and pine and cedar from Syria. Hatshepsut&#x27;s expedition to Punt returned bearing thirty-one live frankincense trees, the roots of which were carefully kept in baskets for the duration of the voyage; this was the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees. It is reported that Hatshepsut had these trees planted in the courts of her Deir el Bahri mortuary temple complex.

Marco Polo describes how Kublai Khan collected specimens of evergreen trees that he admired from around the Mongol Empire in the late 13th century, and had them brought by elephant to his winter capital at Khanbaliq (modern Beijing), where they were planted on a large artificial mound, &quot;a hundred paces in height and over a mile in cicumference&quot;, known as the &quot;Green Mound&quot;, with a palace or pavilion at the top. The ground of the mound was also covered in pieces of green stone.

In an arboretum a wide variety of trees and shrubs are cultivated. Typically the individual trees are labelled for identification. The trees may also be organised in a way to aid their study or growth.

Many tree collections have been claimed as the first modern arboretum, with the term applied retrospectively as it probably did not come into use even orally until the later eighteenth century, or later. Probably the most important early proponent of the arboretum in the English-speaking transatlantic world was the prolific landscape gardener and writer, John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843) who undertook many gardening commissions and published the &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Encyclopaedia of Gardening&quot; and other major works. Loudon&#x27;s &quot;Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum&quot;, 8 vols., (1838) is probably the most significant work on the subject in British history and included an account of all trees and shrubs that were hardy in the British climate, an international history of arboriculture, an assessment of the cultural, economic and industrial value of trees and four volumes of plates.

Loudon urged that a national arboretum be created and called for arboreta and other systematic collections to be established in public parks, private gardens, country estates, and other places. He regarded the Derby Arboretum (1840) as the most important landscape-gardening commission of the latter part of his career because it demonstrated the benefits of a public arboretum (for more details see below). Commenting on the Loddiges family&#x27;s famous Hackney Botanic Garden arboretum, begun in 1816, which was a commercial nursery that subsequently opened free to the public, for educational benefit, every Sunday, Loudon wrote: &quot;The arboretum looks better this season than it has ever done since it was planted... The more lofty trees suffered from the late high winds, but not materially. We walked round the two outer spirals of this coil of trees and shrubs; viz. from &quot;Acer&quot; to &quot;Quercus&quot;. There is no garden scene about London so interesting&quot;. A plan of the Loddiges&#x27; arboretum was included in &quot;The Encyclopaedia of Gardening&quot;, 1834 edition. Leaves from Loddiges&#x27; arboretum and in some instances entire trees, were studiously drawn to illustrate Loudon&#x27;s encyclopaedic book &quot;Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum&quot; which also incorporated drawings from other early botanic gardens and parklands throughout the United Kingdom.

One example of an early European tree collection is the Trsteno Arboretum, near Dubrovnik in Croatia. The date of its founding is unknown, but it was already in existence by 1492, when a span aqueduct to irrigate the arboretum was constructed; this aqueduct is still in use. The garden was created by the prominent local Gučetić/Gozze family. It suffered two major disasters in the 1990s but its two unique and ancient Oriental Planes remained standing.

===Europe===

;Abney Park Arboretum, London, England
Shortly before the Derby Arboretum opened in 1840, another arboretum was opened for free public access at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington near London, modelled partly on Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston and designed by Loddiges nursery. It was laid out with 2,500 trees and shrubs, all labelled and arranged in an unusual alphabetical format from A for &quot;Acer&quot; (maple trees) to Z for &quot;Zanthoxylum&quot; (American toothache trees). Until Kew was enlarged and opened to the public, this remained the largest arboretum in Europe. It never achieved the recognition of the better financed early nineteenth century botanical gardens and arboreta that could afford members&#x27; events, indoor facilities and curatorial staff for those who paid accordingly. However, unlike these, and even unlike the &#x27;public&#x27; arboretum at Derby, the Abney Park arboretum always offered public access free of charge, though sometimes, by pre-arrangement; a &quot;Viewing Order&quot; was needed so as not to interfere with funeral events.

;Derby Arboretum, Derbyshire, England
The Derby Arboretum opened on 16 September 1840. Commissioned and presented by Joseph Strutt (1766–1844) a wealthy industrialist and major local benefactor, the Derby Arboretum was designed by John Claudius Loudon and had a major impact upon the development of urban parks. It was one of the first Victorian public parks and also unusual for the quality of its collection of trees and shrubs. Although established on only quite a small site of 14 acres, the park featured a labelled collection of over 1000 trees and shrubs and was landscaped with mounds, sinuous paths, urns, benches, statues, lodges and other features. Managed by a committee until it was acquired by the Derby Corporation during the 1880s, the Derby Arboretum was only open free to the public for two days of the week for its first four decades, the remaining days being reserved for subscribers and their families and guests. Very popular anniversary festivals were staged annually which drew crowds of tens of thousands and helped to fund the upkeep of the park. The Derby Arboretum is also significant because it was the planted counterpart to Loudon&#x27;s &quot;Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum&quot; (1838) which detailed all the hardy and semi-hardy trees and shrubs of the British Isles. Within the park, the trees and shrubs were laid out according to the natural system and labelled so that visitors could identify them using the guide.

The Derby park had a major impact on park design elsewhere including Europe, the British colonies and North America and other public parks and arboreta were established modelled on Loudon&#x27;s creation and using his ideas. In 1859 for example, it was visited by Frederick Law Olmsted on his European tour of parks, and it had an influence on the planting in Central Park, New York. Industrial pollution killed most of the original plantings by the 1880s (although a few examples remain), but it has been renovated and replanted with National Lottery Heritage funding closer to Loudon&#x27;s original layout and with a new cafe and visitor centre.

;Dropmore Park, Buckinghamshire, England

Part of the post-millennium restoration is to use what survives as the basis for a collection of some 200 species.

;Dømmesmoen Arboret, Grimstad, Aust-Agder, Norway
Dømmesmoen Arboret is a arboretum in Grimstad municipality, Aust-Agder county, Norway.

<doc id="338457" wikidata="Q927573" url="?curid=338457" title="Nelson W. Aldrich">
<text>Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich (//; November 6, 1841 – April 16, 1915) was a prominent American politician and a leader of the Republican Party in the United States Senate, where he represented Rhode Island from 1881 to 1911. By the 1890s, he was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; key Republicans who largely controlled the major decisions of the Senate, along with Orville H. Platt, William B. Allison, and John Coit Spooner. Because of his impact on national politics and central position on the pivotal Senate Finance Committee, he was referred to by the press and public alike as the &quot;general manager of the Nation&quot;, dominating tariff and monetary policy in the first decade of the 20th century.

Born at Burgess Farm in Foster, Rhode Island, Aldrich served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war, he worked his way up to become a partner in a large wholesale grocery firm and won election to the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He then served a single term in the United States House of Representatives before winning election to the Senate. In the Senate, he helped to create an extensive system of tariffs that protected American factories and farms from foreign competition, and he was a cosponsor of the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act. He also helped win Senate approval of the 1898 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish–American War.

Aldrich led the passage of the Aldrich–Vreeland Act, which established the National Monetary Commission to study the causes of the Panic of 1907. He served as chair of that commission, which drew up the Aldrich Plan as a basis for a reform of the financial regulatory system. The Aldrich Plan strongly influenced the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which established the Federal Reserve System. Aldrich also sponsored the Sixteenth Amendment, which allowed for a direct federal income tax.

Deeply committed to the efficiency model of the Progressive Era, he believed that his financial and trade policies would lead to greater efficiency. Reformers, however, denounced him as representative of the evils of big business. His daughter Abigail married American financer John D. Rockefeller Jr. who was the son of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller. His descendants, including namesake Nelson A. Rockefeller, became powerful figures in American politics and banking.

==Early life ==
Aldrich was born at Burgess Farm in Foster, Rhode Island, into a middle-class family purportedly descended from noted English immigrants John Winthrop, William Wickenden, and Roger Williams. His branch passed through generations of declining circumstances. His father was Anan E. Aldrich, a mill hand, and mother Abby Burgess. He attended public schools in East Killingly, Connecticut and the East Greenwich Academy, a boarding school in Rhode Island.

==Early career==

Aldrich&#x27;s first job was clerking for the largest wholesale grocer in the state, where he worked his way up to become a partner in the firm.

He served briefly in the Union Army during the American Civil War when he enlisted as a private in Company D of the 10th Rhode Island Infantry on May 26, 1862. Aldrich&#x27;s company served for three months at Fort DeRussy, which was part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. Aldrich was mustered out of service with the regiment on September 1, 1862.

On October 9, 1866, he married Abigail Pearce Truman &quot;Abby&quot; Chapman, a wealthy woman with impressive ancestry. They had a total of eleven children.

Aldrich began to debate at the local public lecture hall on various political issues of the era. In 1872, after the loss of a child and in the midst of health issues, Aldrich took a five-month tour of Europe and renewed his life&#x27;s ambition. Aldrich became involved with politics and with the help of local business people in Providence, Aldrich also became a director of a small bank.

==Early political career==
By 1877, Nelson had a major effect on state politics, even before his election to the United States Congress. He served as a member of the Providence City Council from 1869 to 1875 and as its president in 1872 and 1873, he then was elected as a Republican to the Rhode Island House of Representatives, from 1875 to 1876, and served as Speaker of the House in 1876.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1878 the Republican bosses of Rhode Island endorsed him for the U.S. House of Representatives; he won and served one term, 1879 to 1881. In 1881 he was elected to the U.S. Senate by the Rhode Island legislature. He served in the Senate for 30 years from 1881 to 1911. He was the longest-serving United States Senator from Rhode Island before the 36-year tenure of Claiborne Pell in the late 20th century.

His long tenure in the Senate was assisted by Rhode Island&#x27;s restriction of the office to property owners and native-born citizens willing to pay a poll tax, and later, by a legislature that gerrymandered in favor of small Republican towns. Aldrich occupied himself with national tariff issues when arriving in the Senate, and supported the tariff as vital to business owners and ordinary citizens alike. Alrich actively sought out the opinion of business leaders and became friendly with the Sugar Trust. Aldrich sometimes even secured the tariff rate to the amount that Theodore Havemeyer, a Sugar Trust member, requested.

By the 1890s, he was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; key Republicans who largely controlled the major decisions of the Senate, along with Orville H. Platt of Connecticut, William B. Allison of Iowa and John Coit Spooner of Wisconsin. Aldrich&#x27;s main power base was his chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee which oversaw bank regulation and monetary policy. In the early 1890s, Aldrich was considering leaving the Senate, however, a businessman from Rhode Island, Marsden J. Perry, convinced him to stay by making Aldrich a partner in a plan to consolidate and electrify the state&#x27;s trolley systems. Aldrich soon became a millionaire. Aldrich was opposed to backing currency with silver and was involved with convincing McKinley to run on a gold platform in 1896.

In 1906 Aldrich sold his interest in the Rhode Island street railway system to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, whose president, Charles Sanger Mellen, was Wall Street banker J. P. Morgan&#x27;s loyal ally.

===National finance===

In his subsequent career in the senate he was prominent in the discussion of the great financial questions that arose in Congress.

The panic of 1907 led to the passage of the Aldrich–Vreeland Act in 1908, which established the National Monetary Commission, sponsored and headed by Aldrich. After issuing a series of 30 reports, this commission drew up the Aldrich Plan, forming the basis for the Federal Reserve system.

As co-author of the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909, Aldrich removed restrictive import duties on fine art, which enabled Americans to bring in very expensive European artworks that became the foundation of many leading museums.

In 1909, Aldrich introduced a constitutional amendment to establish an income tax, although he had declared a similar measure &quot;communistic&quot; a decade earlier. Aldrich was quite candid about his scheme to block the House bill that had been passed, declaring to the Senate: &quot;I shall vote for the corporation tax as a means to defeat the income tax.&quot;

The compromise passed unanimously in the Senate and by a vote of 318 to 14 in the House. The corporate excise tax would be levied, and the income-tax constitutional amendment would be sent out to the states for ratification—which Taft and Aldrich thought was impossible.

Aldrich also served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. During his Senate tenure he chaired the committees on Finance, Transportation Routes to the Seaboard, Rules, and the Select Committee on Corporations Organized in the District of Columbia.

===Federal Reserve Act===
Following the Panic of 1907, Aldrich took control as chairman of the Congressionally established National Monetary Commission. A proponent of Progressive Era themes of Efficiency and scientific expertise, he led a team of experts to study the European national banks. After his trip, he came to believe that Britain, Germany and France had much superior central banking systems. He worked with several key bankers and economists, including Paul Warburg, Abram Andrew, Frank A. Vanderlip, and Henry Davison, to design a plan for an American central bank in 1911. This work included a trip to Jekyll Island in 1910 to finalize the details of the federal reserve banking plan. In 1913 Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Federal Reserve Act patterned after Aldrich&#x27;s vision, creating the modern Federal Reserve System.

===Foreign affairs===
Aldrich opposed entry into the Spanish–American War, but supported McKinley when it began. He played a central role in winning two-thirds Senate approval of the Treaty of Paris that ended the war, and included annexation of the Philippines. He helped frame the Platt Amendment of 1901, which defined the American role in Cuba. He supported the Panama Canal, but was critical of Roosevelt&#x27;s general Caribbean policy.

In 1906 Aldrich and other American financiers invested heavily in mines and rubber in the Belgian Congo. They supported Belgium&#x27;s King Leopold II, who had imposed very harsh labor conditions in the colony.

==Family prominence==
His daughter Abigail Greene &quot;Abby&quot; Aldrich was a philanthropist who married American financer and philanthropist John Davison Rockefeller, Jr. who was the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller. Their second son Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller was a four-term Governor of New York who campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination in 1960, 1964, and 1968, and was named Vice President of the United States under President Gerald Ford by the Congress in 1974. Aldrich&#x27;s son Richard S. Aldrich served in Congress from 1923 to 1933, and his son Winthrop Williams Aldrich served as chairman of the Chase National Bank. His grandson David Rockefeller would eventually become the chairman and would become a leading banker. American film director, writer, and producer Robert Aldrich was his grandson.

==Interests==
Aldrich was very active in the Freemasons and was Treasurer of the Grand Lodge of Rhode Island.

He developed an elaborate country estate in the Warwick Neck section of Warwick, Rhode Island. The estate is now known as the Aldrich Mansion and is owned by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rhode Island.

==Death and burial==
He died on April 16, 1915, in New York City, and was buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Legacy==
The Nelson W. Aldrich House on 110 Benevolent Street in Providence serves as the headquarters for the Rhode Island Historical Society.

<text>William Boyd Allison (March 2, 1829 – August 4, 1908) was an American politician. An early leader of the Iowa Republican Party, he represented northeastern Iowa in the United States House of Representatives before representing his state in the United States Senate. By the 1890s, Allison had become one of the &quot;big four&quot; key Republicans who largely controlled the Senate, along with Orville H. Platt of Connecticut, John Coit Spooner of Wisconsin and Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island.

Born in Perry, Ohio, Allison established a legal practice in Dubuque, Iowa and became a prominent member of the nascent Iowa Republican Party. He was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention and won election to the House of Representatives in 1862. He served four terms in the House and won election to the Senate in 1872. He became chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, serving for all but two years between 1881 and 1908. Four different Republican presidents asked Allison to join their Cabinet, but Allison declined each offer. A significant number of delegates supported his presidential nomination at the 1888 and 1896 Republican National Conventions.

Allison emerged as a centrist and pragmatic leader in the Senate, and he helped pass several important bills. The Bland–Allison Act of 1878 restored bimetallism, but in a less inflationary manner than had been sought by Congressman Richard P. Bland. A prominent advocate of higher tariffs, Allison played a major role in the passage of the McKinley Tariff and the Dingley Act. He also helped pass the Hepburn Act by offering the Allison amendment, which granted courts the power to review the Interstate Commerce Commission&#x27;s railroad rate-setting. Allison sought a record seventh term in 1908, but died shortly after winning the Republican primary against progressive leader Albert B. Cummins.

==Early life and career==
Born in Perry, Ohio, Allison was educated at Wooster Academy. Afterward, he spent a year at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania, then graduated from Western Reserve College (then located in Hudson, Ohio) in 1849. He then studied law and began practicing in Ashland, Ohio. While practicing law there from 1852 until 1857, he was a delegate to the 1855 Ohio Republican Convention and an unsuccessful candidate for district attorney in 1856. In 1857, he moved to Dubuque, Iowa, which would serve as his hometown for the last fifty years of his life.

While in Ohio, Allison&#x27;s rise in politics coincided during a period of time where the Whig Party was facing collapse due to internal divisions over slavery. An abolitionist and supporter of business interests, he served in conventions to the newly formed Republican Party as well as the Know Nothing Party.

Although serving in the 1856 Know Nothing national convention, Allison left the party and joined the Republicans. Following an unsuccessful bid for county attorney, he moved to Dubuque, Iowa, where his older brother resided. Although the city was a stronghold for the Democratic Party at the time, Allison&#x27;s ties with a law partnership and a Presbyterian church proved to successfully propel him into the state GOP leadership.

==Civil War==
After his arrival in Dubuque, Allison took a prominent part in the politics of the nascent Republican Party. He was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, which nominated Abraham Lincoln for President of the United States.

During the subsequent Civil War, he was on the staff of Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood, who ordered him to help the state raise regiments for the war. He personally helped raise four regiments. He was given the rank of lieutenant colonel during the war, although it was unlikely he actually served in uniform.

In 1862, in the midst of the war, Allison was elected to the United States House of Representatives as the representative of Iowa&#x27;s newly created 3rd congressional district. As a congressman and member of the House Ways and Means Committee, he pushed for higher tariffs.

The Census of 1860 led to an increase in Iowa&#x27;s congressional district seats from two to six. In the 1862 midterms, Allison ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from the third district which included Dubuque, challenging incumbent Republican congressman William Vandever. Benefiting from connections to Kirkwood in addition to railroad interests, he denied Vandever renomination and won the general election.

In the House, Allison sided with the powerful Radical Republican wing of the party which frequently opposed President Lincoln&#x27;s policies as being too moderate, instead favoring a harsher treatment of the Confederacy. After being re-elected in 1864, he was a member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, in addition to emerging as a leading expert on protective tariffs and railroads. His tariff viewpoints were described as having &quot;not always pleased&quot; constituents.

The Radical Republicans were not unified on ideological issues aside from their advocacy of harsher Reconstruction policies to ensure and safeguard the constitutional rights of blacks. Indeed, Allison broke from the factions&#x27; more staunchly conservative members in maintaining a moderate stance on tariff policy. However, he strongly represented railroad interests, on which he was accused of conflicts of interests.

==Post-war political career==

Following the war, Allison continued to serve in the House after winning re-election in 1866 and 1868. In January 1870, he was an unsuccessful candidate for election by the Iowa General Assembly to the United States Senate seat for 1871–1877, losing to Iowa Supreme Court Justice George G. Wright. Allison declined to be a candidate for renomination to his own House seat later that year, but instead focused on laying the groundwork to run for Iowa&#x27;s other Senate seat (then held by James Harlan), which was up in January 1872, following November 1871 state legislative races. In the 1871 state legislative races, candidates were nominated and elected on the direct issue of whether they would vote for Harlan, Allison or James F. Wilson for senator. Enough legislators who favored Allison were nominated and elected in 1871 that in January 1872 he won the required number of votes to take Harlan&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat, effective March 4, 1873.

Allison was reelected to six-year terms in the U.S. Senate six times – in 1878, 1884, 1890, 1896, and 1902. His U.S. Senate tenure was marked by his influence on regulation, railroad, and tariff policy. Initially retaining the moderate stances he was known for during his House years, Allison over time sided with protectionists. A defender of President Ulysses S. Grant, he also allied with the Stalwarts, the conservative wing of the GOP which opposed civil service reform in the late 1870s out of concern for the plight of Southern blacks in addition to supporting Grant during the 1880 United States presidential election.

He chaired the 1884–1886 Allison Commission, a bipartisan joint congressional committee &quot;among the first to explore the question of whether federal intervention politicizes scientific research.&quot; It considered the charge that parts of the government were engaged in research for theoretical, not practical, purposes. The majority report favored the status quo, and Congress upheld it. In 1885, the Commission&#x27;s finding of misuse of funds at the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey led to the dismissal of several officials but exonerated Charles Sanders Peirce.

As Allison earned seniority, he also earned one of the most powerful committee positions. From 1881–93 and again from 1895 to 1908, he was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he had great influence. Allison&#x27;s combined years as chairman of the committee make him the longest-serving chairman to date. He was also a member of the Senate Committee of Indian Affairs (and its chairman from 1875 to 1881), the Senate Finance Committee, and the Committee on Engrossed Bills. He became chairman of the Senate Republican Conference in 1897.

He was asked three times to serve as the Secretary of the Treasury, first by President James A. Garfield, whose offer he accepted, but later he asked for his name to be withdrawn after being pressured out of it by the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party, of which he was a part of. Later, President Chester Arthur offered (to which Allison again agreed but then the next day declined), then by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley offered him the position of U.S. Secretary of State. Again, Allison declined.

It was deemed just as well; no Republican senator was so well fitted for the duties of responsible statesmanship, or positioned so well. For thirty years he sat on the Senate Finance Committee and took a critical role in framing legislation. In 1881, he became chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and continued to serve there until his death in 1908. After 1897, he was chosen as chairman of the Republican caucus, an unofficial position, but one generally accorded to the most venerable and respected party member in the Senate.

Eminently conservative, trusted by the railroad interests, Allison&#x27;s pragmatism made him the centrist that everybody could deal with, including Democratic colleagues. When in 1888 a Republican alternative was needed to the Mills tariff bill coming out of the House, Allison handled the details. The bill that emerged from committee was purely for campaign purposes. Nobody thought that it could pass, but it put the best face on protectionist principles and later served as a model for the 1890 McKinley Tariff, which Allison played a large part in framing. In 1897, when the Dingley Tariff bill reached the Senate, Allison did most of the work reconciling discontented interests. When the Bland bill, allowing the free coinage of silver, came to the Senate, Allison altered it. The resulting Bland–Allison Act of 1878 simply had the government buy a certain, more limited amount of silver, which the Treasury was permitted to put into circulation as silver dollars. It was far less inflationary than Bland&#x27;s original bill. The Act passed over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. It remained unchanged until the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890. In 1892, Allison chaired the Brussels Monetary Conference and in 1900 was one of the fathers of the Gold Standard Act.

In 1896, he became a dark-horse candidate for the presidency. However, support for his candidacy faded when it became clear that McKinley would be nominated on the first ballot.

&quot;Allison is the man of experience,&quot; an admiring reporter wrote in 1906, &quot;the sage old pilot of the Senate. They say that no man who has ever been in the Senate knew so much about it as he does. He is the political forecaster, the compromiser, the weather prophet, the man who brings irreconcilable things together. It is said that the oldest inhabitant cannot recall having heard Allison give utterance to an opinion on any subject whatever. Doubtless he does give utterance to them, but never except in the inner councils of the Caesars. Sagacious to the point of craft, it does not annoy him to know that the epithet most frequently applied to him is &#x27;the Old Fox.&#x27;...When he rises in his place in the Senate, he disdains to talk as if he were making a speech; he leaves all that to the youngsters, whose sum of knowledge does not equal all that he has forgotten. He never rises except to shed light on some knotty point, and when he does it is always as briefly as possible, and in a conversational voice that is almost an undertone. Then he drops back into his seat and, with sublime indifference, lets the talk go on.&quot;
Allison was married twice, first to Anna Carter, who died in 1859, four years after the marriage. His second marriage was to Mary Neally, who died in 1883, ten years after their marriage.

==1908 Senate race==

In 1908, as Allison neared his 44th year in Congress, and his 80th birthday, he sought a record seventh term in the Senate. However, Iowa&#x27;s Republican Governor at the time, Albert B. Cummins, had aspired to become a U.S. Senator for several years, and as leader of Republican progressives had targeted his party&#x27;s &quot;old guard&quot; for retirement or (if necessary) defeat. After seeming to promise that he would not challenge Allison in 1908, Cummins ran against Allison for the Republican nomination in the state&#x27;s first-ever congressional primary on June 2, 1908. Much like Allison&#x27;s 1873 race for the Senate against incumbent Harlan, Cummins&#x27; 1908 race for the Senate against incumbent Allison was very acrimonious. However, this time the incumbent prevailed; Allison won a clear victory over Cummins by over ten thousand votes. As a reflection of the nature of its preference for Allison over Cummins, the &quot;Ames Times&quot; reported the primary results under a two-level banner headline simply stating &quot;GLORY TO GOD!&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Allison did not live to see the 1908 general election or a seventh term. Two months after his primary win, he died in Dubuque. Many were surprised by his death, but news reports soon indicated that he had been under constant medical care for more than two years and that those familiar with his condition had expected his death. He was interred in Linwood Cemetery, in Dubuque.

Governor Cummins was elected by the legislature to fill the unexpired term of Senator Allison and for the term beginning March 4, 1909. He was re-elected in 1914 and 1920 but in June 1926 lost in the Republican primary to Smith W. Brookhart. Cummins died shortly after his loss in the primary.

Allison was the namesake of Allison, Iowa, the county seat of Butler County.

The Allison-Henderson Park in Dubuque was named in honor of Allison and a fellow Dubuque icon, US House Speaker David B. Henderson.

There is an imposing memorial to Allison by sculptor Evelyn Beatrice Longman on the grounds of the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines.

<doc id="338467" wikidata="Q184809" url="?curid=338467" title="Show Me!">
<text>Show Me! is a sex education book by photographer Will McBride. It appeared in 1974 in German under the title &quot;Zeig Mal!&quot;, written with psychiatrist Helga Fleischhauer-Hardt for children and their parents. It was translated into English a year later and was widely available in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic for many years, but later became subject to expanded child pornography laws in jurisdictions including the United States. In Germany, the book was followed in 1990 by a second edition that included, among other additions, a discussion of the AIDS epidemic.

==Publication history==
While many parents appreciated &quot;Show Me!&quot; for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their sexuality, others called it child pornography. In 1975 and 1976, obscenity charges were brought against the publisher or booksellers by prosecutors in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In all four cases, the judges ruled as a matter of law that the title was not obscene.

However, starting in 1977, some states began to criminalize the distribution of even &quot;non-obscene&quot; so-called &quot;child pornography,&quot; or &quot;images of abuse,&quot; which arguably is not protected by the First Amendment. New York State, home of the publisher, St. Martin&#x27;s Press, criminalized the distribution of non-obscene &quot;child pornography&quot; in 1977, but the publisher promptly went to court and obtained an injunction against the State. The court granted the injunction because the First Amendment was interpreted to permit the banning of only obscene material.

In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision, &quot;New York v. Ferber&quot;, which allowed the government to constitutionally ban the knowing distribution of even non-obscene &quot;child pornography&quot;. Citing a chilling effect, St. Martin&#x27;s Press then pulled the book, stating that though they believed &quot;Show Me!&quot; was not pornographic, they could no longer afford the legal expenses to defend it, and they did not want to risk criminal prosecutions of their own personnel and/or vendors who sold the book. The Court overruled a decision of the New York Court of Appeals, &quot;The People v. Paul Ira Ferber&quot;, which held that the First Amendment protected the dissemination of non-obscene sexual depictions. &quot;Show Me!&quot; was not the direct subject of the &quot;Ferber&quot; case, but the book was prominently featured by both sides in the litigation, and it played a significant role in the oral argument before the U.S. Supreme Court.

In its country of origin, Germany, the book first won several awards, even from church organisations, but due to rising pressure from a newly arising &quot;moral majority&quot; the publishers and McBride decided to take it off the market in 1996. By then over one million copies in seven languages had been sold. It was never officially banned in Germany. Public libraries there keep it on hand and out of print copies are openly sold at collectors&#x27; premium prices.

In New Zealand the book was banned by the Indecent Publications Tribunal in 1976. The ban was upheld in 1996.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Show Me!&quot; received mixed reviews from the mass media when it was first published. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the photographs &quot;beautiful...graceful, charming, and elegant,&quot; yet accurately predicted, in a severe understatement of what actually happened, that the book &quot;may start (an) uproar.&quot; The &quot;Washington Post&quot;, on the other hand, described the photographs as &quot;beautiful, assaultive, grotesque, and seductive,&quot; and concluded that &quot;Show Me!&quot; was only suited for &quot;avant garde&quot; parents. Reviewer Linda Wolfe was more hostile in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, calling the book a &quot;child-abusive joke&quot;. The 13-year-old daughter of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reviewer Carol Kleiman stated: &quot;I&#x27;m too old for it myself. The last part, though, with no pictures, looks interesting to read. The book is good for little kids because they don&#x27;t know what society terms &#x27;dirty&#x27; yet. You know, Mom, it&#x27;s PARENTS I&#x27;m worried about. &quot;They&#x27;re&quot; not ready yet.&quot;

===Recent reviews===
A 2005 Amazon review by Dr. Russell A. Rohde claims that the book, &quot;appropriately delves into the issues of breast feeding, adolescence, pubertal changes, menses, sexual anatomies, pregnancy, masturbation, contraception, sexual behavioral disturbances and venereal disease. [...] I am not aware of any book comparable to this illustrated primer that fills the needs of sexual education so well.&quot;

D. F. Janssen places it at the one extreme of a late 20th-century visual and textual revolution that enabled parents to illustrate information that up to that time had been transmitted orally. He sees the work as subversive not for its &quot;too frank&quot; portrayal of childhood sexuality, but instead for the primacy that the image takes over the text. In his eyes, the work &quot;comes out of a culture with a long history of pathologising so-addressed &#x27;primal scenes,&#x27;&quot; a history that became manifest in particular with regard to the works of Will McBride.

The book is analyzed in an article on &quot;Picturing Sex Education&quot; (Discourse Volume 27, Number 4 / December 2006).

In 2016, Pennsylvania State University PhD. Brett L. Lunceford, an independent researcher in the field of Rhetoric, Sexuality and Gender, wrote an article &quot;«Mommy and Daddy Were Married, and Other Creation Myths in Children’s Books About Sex»&quot;, published in &quot;«The Rhetorical Power of Children&#x27;s Literature»&quot;, with a review of few children&#x27;s books about sex. Among them, Peter Mayle&#x27;s &quot;&quot; compared versus Will McBride&#x27;s &quot;«Show Me!»&quot;, highlighting issues and good sides of each book in textual part and in visual illustration. Lunceford resumed his article stating that &quot;“the children&#x27;s books that children read help to shape the world in which they eventually live”&quot;.

<text>The United States Central Command (USCENTCOM or CENTCOM) is one of the eleven unified combatant commands of the U.S. Department of Defense. It was established in 1983, taking over the previous responsibilities of the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF). It is currently designated as a terrorist organization by Iran.

Its Area of Responsibility (AOR) includes the Middle East (including Egypt in Africa), Central Asia and parts of South Asia. The command has been the main American presence in many military operations, including the Persian Gulf War&#x27;s Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the War in Afghanistan, as well as the Iraq War from 2003 to 2011. , CENTCOM forces were deployed primarily in Afghanistan under the auspices of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel, which was itself part of NATO&#x27;s Resolute Support Mission (from 2015 to 2021), and in Iraq and Syria as part of Operation Inherent Resolve since 2014 in supporting and advise-and-assist roles.

, CENTCOM&#x27;s commander is General Michael E. Kurilla, U.S. Army. Two of the last three United States secretaries of defense – Lloyd Austin and James Mattis, both of whom required congressional waivers to be confirmed – were recent CENTCOM commanders.

Of all seven American regional unified combatant commands, CENTCOM is among four that are headquartered outside their area of operations (the other three being USAFRICOM, USSOUTHCOM, and USSPACECOM). CENTCOM&#x27;s main headquarters is located at MacDill Air Force Base, in Tampa, Florida. A forward headquarters was established in 2002 at Camp As Sayliyah in Doha, Qatar, which in 2009 transitioned to a forward headquarters at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

In January 2021, Israel became the 21st country of the AOR, added to another 20 nations including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Yemen.

==History==

The command was established on 1 January 1983. As its name implies, CENTCOM covers the &quot;central&quot; area of the globe located between the African, European and Indo-Pacific Commands. When the hostage crisis in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan underlined the need to strengthen U.S. interests in the region, President Jimmy Carter established the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF) in March 1980. Steps were taken to transform the RDJTF into a permanent unified command over a two-year period. The first step was to make the RDJTF independent of U.S. Readiness Command, followed by the activation of CENTCOM in January 1983. Overcoming skeptical perceptions that the command was still an RDJTF in all but name, designed to support a Cold War strategy, took time.

The Iran–Iraq War clearly underlined the growing tensions in the region, and developments such as Iranian mining operations in the Persian Gulf led to CENTCOM&#x27;s first combat operations. On 17 May 1987, the , conducting operations in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War, was struck by Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi aircraft, resulting in 37 casualties. Soon afterward, as part of what became known as the &quot;Tanker War&quot;, the Federal government of the United States reflagged and renamed 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers. In Operation Earnest Will, these tankers were escorted by USCENTCOM&#x27;s Middle East Force through the Persian Gulf to Kuwait and back through the Strait of Hormuz.

By late 1988, the regional strategy still largely focused on the potential threat of a massive Soviet invasion of Iran. Exercise Internal Look has been one of CENTCOM&#x27;s primary planning events. It had frequently been used to train CENTCOM to be ready to defend the Zagros Mountains from a Soviet attack and was held annually.

In autumn 1989, the main CENTCOM contingency plan, OPLAN 1002-88, assumed a Soviet attack through Iran to the Persian Gulf. The plan called for five-and-two-thirds US divisions to deploy, mostly light and heavy forces at something less than full strength (apportioned to it by the Joint Strategic Capability Plan [JSCAP]). The original plan called for these five-and-two-thirds divisions to march from the Persian Gulf to the Zagros Mountains and prevent the Soviet Ground Forces (army) from seizing the Iranian oil fields.

After 1990, General Norman Schwarzkopf reoriented CENTCOM&#x27;s planning to fend off a threat from Iraq, and Internal Look moved to a biennial schedule. There was a notable similarity between the 1990 Internal Look exercise scripts and the real-world movement of Iraqi forces which culminated in Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait during the final days of the exercise. U.S. President George Bush responded quickly. A timely deployment of forces and the formation of a coalition deterred Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia, and the command began to focus on the liberation of Kuwait. The buildup of forces continued, reinforced by United Nations Security Council Resolution 678, which called for Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait. On 17 January 1991, U.S. and coalition forces launched Operation Desert Storm with a massive air interdiction campaign, which prepared the theater for a coalition ground assault. The primary coalition objective, the liberation of Kuwait, was achieved on 27 February, and the next morning a ceasefire was declared, just one hundred hours after the commencement of the ground campaign.

The end of formal hostilities did not bring the end of difficulties with Iraq. Operation Provide Comfort, implemented to provide humanitarian assistance to the Kurds and enforce a &quot;no-fly&quot; zone in Iraq, north of the 36th parallel, began in April 1991. In August 1992, Operation Southern Watch began in response to Saddam&#x27;s noncompliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 condemning his brutal repression of Iraqi civilians in southeastern Iraq. Under the command and control of Joint Task Force Southwest Asia, coalition forces in this operation enforced a no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel. In January 1997, Operation Northern Watch replaced Provide Comfort, with a focus on enforcing the northern no-fly zone. Throughout the decade, CENTCOM carried out a string of operationsVigilant Warrior, Vigilant Sentinel, Desert Strike, Desert Thunder (I and II), and Desert Foxto try to coerce Saddam into greater compliance with U.S. wishes.

The 1990s also brought significant challenges in Somalia as well as from the growing threat of regional terrorism. To prevent widespread starvation as the Somali Civil War continued, CENTCOM began Operation Provide Relief in 1992 to supply humanitarian assistance to Somalia and northeastern Kenya. CENTCOM&#x27;s Operation Restore Hope supported United Nations Security Council Resolution 794 and a multinational Unified Task Force, which provided security until the U.N. created UNOSOM II in May 1993. In spite of some UNOSOM II success in the countryside, the situation in Mogadishu worsened, and the significant casualties of the Battle of Mogadishu ultimately led President Bill Clinton to order the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Somalia.

Throughout the 1990s, following the Gulf War, terrorist attacks had a major impact on CENTCOM forces. Faced with attacks such as the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers, which killed 19 American airmen, the command launched Operation Desert Focus, designed to relocate U.S. installations to more defensible locations (such as Prince Sultan Air Base), reduce the U.S. forward &quot;footprint&quot; by eliminating nonessential billets, and return dependents to the United States. In 1998 terrorists attacked the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 250 persons, including 12 Americans. The October 2000 attack on the USS &quot;Cole&quot;, resulting in the deaths of 17 U.S. sailors, was linked to Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Al Qaida organization.

From April to July 1999, CENTCOM conducted Exercise Desert Crossing 1999, centered on the scenario of Saddam Hussein being ousted as Iraq&#x27;s dictator. It was held in the offices of Booz Allen Hamilton in McLean, Virginia. The exercise concluded that unless measures were taken, &quot;fragmentation and chaos&quot; would ensue after Saddam Hussein&#x27;s overthrow.

The September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington DC led President George W. Bush to declare a war against international terrorism. CENTCOM soon launched Operation Enduring Freedom to expel the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which was harboring Al Qaida terrorists and hosting terrorist training camps.

Exercise Internal Look has been employed for explicit war planning on at least two occasions: Internal Look &#x27;90, which dealt with a threat from Iraq, and Internal Look &#x27;03, which was used to plan what became Operation Iraqi Freedom - the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq, which began on 19 March 2003.

Following the defeat of both the Taliban regime in Afghanistan (9 November 2001) and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government in Iraq (8 April 2003), CENTCOM has continued to provide security to the new freely-elected governments in those countries, conducting counterinsurgency operations and assisting host nation security forces to provide for their own defense.

Beginning in October 2002, CENTCOM conducted operations in the Horn of Africa to combat terrorism, establish a secure environment, and foster regional stability. These operations involved a series of Special Operations Forces raids, humanitarian assistance, consequence management, and a variety of civic action programs.

The command has also remained poised to provide disaster relief throughout the region; its most recent significant relief operations have been a response to the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan, and the large-scale evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon in 2006.
On 1 October 2008, the Department of Defense transferred responsibility for Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, and Somalia to the newly established Africa Command. Egypt, home to Exercise Bright Star, the Department of Defense&#x27;s largest reoccurring military exercise, remained in the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility. On 15 January 2021, responsibility for Israel was transferred from Europe Command to CENTCOM.

In January 2015, CENTCOM&#x27;s Twitter feed was reported to have been hacked on 11 January by ISIS sympathizers. This situation lasted for less than one hour; no classified information was posted and &quot;none of the information posted came from CENTCOM&#x27;s server or social media sites&quot;; however, some of the slides came from the federally funded Lincoln Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In August 2015, intelligence analysts working for CENTCOM complained to the media, alleging that CENTCOM&#x27;s senior leadership was altering or distorting intelligence reports on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In February 2017, the Inspector General of the United States Department of Defense completed its investigation and cleared the senior leadership of CENTCOM, concluding that &quot;allegations of intelligence being intentionally altered, delayed or suppressed by top CENTCOM officials from mid-2014 to mid-2015 were largely unsubstantiated.&quot;

In January 2018, Turkey urged the United States to remove its troops from Syrian city of Manbij, saying that otherwise they might come under attack from Turkish troops; however, former CENTCOM commander Joseph Votel confirmed an American commitment to keeping troops in Manbij. In 2019, the Iranian government designated the United States Central Command a terrorist organization after the Trump administration branded Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps with the same label.

==Structure==
CENTCOM&#x27;s main headquarters is located at MacDill Air Force Base, in Tampa, Florida. CENTCOM headquarters staff directorates include personnel, intelligence, operations, logistics, plans &amp; policy, information systems, training &amp; exercises, and resources, and other functions. The intelligence section is known as Joint Intelligence Center, Central Command, or JICCENT, which serves as a Joint Intelligence Center for the co-ordination of intelligence. Under the intelligence directorate, there are several divisions including the Afghanistan-Pakistan Center of Excellence.

===Component Commands===

CENTCOM directs five &quot;service component commands&quot; and one subordinate unified command:

===Subordinate unified commands===


Two major subordinate multi-service commands reporting to Central Command were responsible for Afghanistan: Combined Joint Task Force 180 and Combined Forces Command Afghanistan (CFC-A). CFC-A was disestablished in February 2007. From that point onward, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) directed most U.S. forces in Afghanistan. A U.S. general (Dan K. McNeill) assumed command of ISAF that same month.

Temporary task forces include the Central Command ForwardJordan (CF-J), which was announced in April 2013. CF-J&#x27;s stated purpose was to work with the Jordanian armed forces to improve the latter&#x27;s capabilities. There was speculation, however, that another reason for its establishment was to serve as a base from which raids into Syria could be launched to seize Syrian WMD if necessary, and as a launch pad for looming American military action in Syria.

On 1 October 2008 Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti was transferred to United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM). The United States Forces – Iraq or USF-I, was a major subordinate multi-service command during the Iraq War order of battle until it was disestablished in 2011.
Elements of other Unified Combatant Commands, especially United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), operate in the CENTCOM area. It appears that SOCCENT does &quot;not&quot; direct the secretive Task Force 88, the ad-hoc grouping of Joint Special Operations Command &#x27;black&#x27; units such as Delta Force and Army Rangers, which is tasked to pursue the most sensitive high-value targets such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban leadership since 11 September 2001. Rather, TF 77, which started out as Task Force 11 and has gone through a number of name/number changes, reports directly to Joint Special Operations Command, part of USSOCOM.

, CENTCOM forces are deployed primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan in combat roles and have support roles at bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and central Asia. CENTCOM forces have also been deployed in Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

===War planning===

The following war plan numbers have been made public:
*OPLAN 1002-88, addressing Soviet-related armed conflict in the CENTCOM AOR
*OPLAN 1002 (Defense of the Arabian Peninsula).
*CENTCOM OPORDER 01-97, Force Protection
*SOCEUR SUPPLAN 1001-90, 9 May 1989
*CENTCOM CONPLAN 1010, July 2003
*CENTCOM CONPLAN 1015-98, possible support to OPLAN 5027 for Korea, 15 March 1991
*CENTCOM 1017, 1999
*CONPLAN 1020
*OPLAN 1021, prior to 1990, referred to &quot;the ..Soviet threat.&quot; OPLAN 1021-88 had a nuclear weapons annex, Annex C, that called for the deployment of some nuclear-capable forces. In September 1990, copying deployment lists from the Cold War planning in haste over to Desert Shield deployments after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait appears to have inadvertently begun the deployment of a MGM-52 Lance short-range ballistic missile unit, 1st Battalion, 12th Field Artillery Regiment. &quot;The unit&#x27;s equipment was literally on railcars and ready to move to ports in Texas before the missilemen were ordered to stand down.&quot;
*CONPLAN 1067, for possible Biological Warfare response
*CENTCOM CONPLAN 1100-95, 31 March 1992

Others listed by Arkin&#x27;s supplements include CENTCOM CONPLAN 1211-07 &quot;Foreign Humanitarian Assistance / Disaster Response Operations.&quot; It was issued in November 2007, and required using the Request for Forces method via then-U.S. Joint Forces Command to supply any required forces.

==Geographic scope==

With the 1983 establishment of CENTCOM Egypt, Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Djibouti came within the area of responsibility (AOR). Thus CENTCOM directed the &#x27;Natural Bond&#x27; exercises with Sudan, the &#x27;Eastern Wind&#x27; exercises with Somalia, and the &#x27;Jade Tiger&#x27; exercises with Oman, Somalia, and Sudan. Exercise Jade Tiger involved the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit with Oman from 29 November 1982 to 8 December 1982.

On 7 February 2007, plans were announced for the creation of a United States Africa Command which transferred responsibility for U.S. military operations across Africa to the new USAFRICOM, except for Egypt. On 1October 2008, the Africa Command became operational and Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, the primary CENTCOM force on the continent, started reporting to AFRICOM at Stuttgart instead of CENTCOM in Tampa.

The Department of Defense uses a variable number of base locations depending on its level of operations. With ongoing warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, the United States Air Force used 35 bases, while in 2006 it used 14, including four in Iraq. The United States Navy maintains one major base and one smaller installation, with extensive deployments afloat and ashore by U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard ships, aviation units and ground units.

==List of commanders==


=== Secretary of Defense ===
Two of the former U.S. Central Command Commanders would later serve as United States Secretary of Defense: General James Mattis and General Lloyd Austin. Mattis served as the 26th U.S. Secretary of Defense. Austin became the 28th U.S. Secretary of Defense on January 22, 2021; he is the current incumbent.

===Unit decorations===

The unit awards depicted below are for Headquarters, U.S. Central Command at MacDill AFB. Award for unit decorations do not apply to any subordinate organization such as the service component commands or any other activities unless the orders specifically address them.

<text>Sonic the Hedgehog is an animated television series that aired from 1993 to 1994 based on Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; video game franchise. It was produced by DIC Productions, Sega of America, and the Italian studio Reteitalia in association with Telecinco, and is the second of DIC&#x27;s &quot;Sonic&quot; cartoons, following &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. To distinguish it from other &quot;Sonic&quot; media, fans commonly refer to the series as &quot;Sonic SatAM&quot;, in reference to its Saturday morning timeslot.

The show features a darker and more dramatic story than the lighter &quot;Adventures&quot;, depicting Sonic and a band of freedom fighters battling to overthrow Dr. Robotnik, now a despotic dictator who conquered their home planet Mobius years ago, and rules it as a polluted industrial dystopia.

The program aired for two seasons with a total of 26 episodes on ABC from September 18, 1993, to December 3, 1994, and continued in reruns until 1995.

Despite its cancellation, a fan following has elevated the series to become a cult hit. Some original characters of the series later appeared in the 1993 video game &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot;. The show also inspired the long-running &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book series by Archie Comics.

==Plot==
Mad scientist Dr. Julian Robotnik rules as dictator over the planet Mobius, having overthrown the city of Mobotropolis with his fleet of military robots, and converted it into a polluted industrial cityscape (Robotropolis), transforming nearly all of its animal citizens into robotic slaves using his Roboticizer machine.

From the hidden woodland village of Knothole, Sonic the Hedgehog and Princess Sally Acorn lead a team of Freedom Fighters in a rebellion against Robotnik&#x27;s regime. Other group members include Sonic&#x27;s best friend Tails, scientist Rotor the Walrus, Antoine Depardieu the Coyote, and half-roboticized Bunnie Rabbot.

During the series, the heroes fight against Swat-Bots commanded by Robotnik and his resentful nephew Snively. Sonic collects Power Rings that temporarily boost his power, and uses them to restore free will to his roboticized Uncle Chuck, inventor of both the rings and the Roboticizer. Chuck acts as a spy among Robotnik&#x27;s ranks. They find Sally&#x27;s father King Acorn, who is imprisoned within the Void, alongside the evil sorcerer Ixis Naugus. They gain new allies including Dulcy the Dragon, Ari the Ram, and Lupe, leader of the elusive Wolf Pack.

In the series finale, Robotnik builds a Doomsday Machine to annihilate all organic life on Mobius. The Freedom Fighters launch a full-scale counterattack, and Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones to destroy his machine. Robotnik disappears amid the wreckage. The Freedom Fighters declare victory, with Sonic and Sally kissing. In a final scene, Snively survives and is accompanied by an unseen ally with red eyes, stated by writer Ben Hurst to be the evil sorceror Naugus, who would have become the main antagonist if a third season were produced.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Sonic (voiced by Jaleel White as his older self and Tahj Mowry as his younger self) is a blue hedgehog and the main protagonist of the series. He is able to run at superhuman speed, and is the only Freedom Fighter capable of using magical rings called Power Rings. Sonic has an impatient and head-strong personality, but is also fearless, heroic, and well-meaning. He always mockingly refers to Robotnik as &quot;Ro-butt-nik&quot;.
* Princess Sally Alicia Acorn (voiced by Kath Soucie as her older self and Lindsay Ridgeway as her younger self) is a chipmunk who is the rightful princess of Mobotropolis and Sonic&#x27;s love interest. As strategist and leader of the Knothole Freedom Fighters, she is knowledgeable and the voice of reason. Sally tries to keep Sonic grounded. She is known for her compassion and master diplomacy.
* Bunnie Rabbot (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh) is a Southern-accented rabbit. Half of her body was roboticized, leaving her left arm and both legs mechanical. She is skilled in martial arts and wants to be returned to normal.
* Antoine &quot;Ant&quot; Depardieu (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a French-accented coyote whose awkwardness often places the others in danger and gets him captured. He has some difficulty speaking English. He has romantic feelings for Princess Sally, and attempts to impress her. However, his selfishness hinders this goal. Sonic often teases Antoine over his shortcomings.
* Rotor (voiced by Mark Ballou in Season 1 and Cam Brainard in Season 2) is a walrus and the mechanic of Knothole Village. He provides the Knothole Freedom Fighters with useful inventions, and accompanies them on infiltrations.
* Tails (voiced by Bradley Pierce) is a young two-tailed fox who idolizes Sonic. While usually left behind in Knothole, he proves useful in deadly missions. 
* Nicole (voiced by Kath Soucie) is a portable computer that Sally uses to hack into Robotnik&#x27;s technology. Nicole speaks in a female monotone, and exhibits artificial intelligence. It is indicated that Sally received Nicole from her father.
* Dulcy (voiced by Cree Summer) is a young dragon, who provides the Knothole Freedom Fighters with transportation. Sporting powerful lungs, Dulcy can blow enemies away and burn/freeze them with fire or ice breath. She has trouble landing, and often crashes mid-flight.

===Villains===
* Dr. Julian Robotnik (voiced by Jim Cummings) is an evil human warlord who seeks to cover Mobius in machinery and transform its population into robotic slaves by roboticizing them. He is chiefly opposed by the Knothole Freedom Fighters. Robotnik&#x27;s obsession with destroying Sonic is often his downfall. In this version, his real first name is Julian, adopting the moniker &quot;Robotnik&quot; after his takeover.
** Snively (voiced by Charlie Adler) is Robotnik&#x27;s nephew and assistant. He is constantly abused by his uncle. As such, Snively hates Robotnik and plots behind his back.
** Cluck (vocal effects by Frank Welker) is a robotic chicken-like bird and the only creature Robotnik shows affection towards.
** Swat-Bots (voiced by Jim Cummings and Frank Welker) are Robotnik&#x27;s primary henchmen and foot soldiers.
* Ixis Naugus (voiced by Michael Bell) is a powerful humanoid sorcerer of indeterminate species with bat-like ears, a rhinoceros horn on his head, a crustacean-like claw for a left hand, and a lizard-like tail. He resents his former associate Robotnik for betraying and imprisoning him within the Void. Naugus desires retribution, but he cannot escape without turning into crystal due to him being in the Void for too long as he can no longer exist outside the void.

===Supporting===
* Sir Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Hedgehog (voiced by William Windom) is Sonic&#x27;s uncle, and the inventor of the Roboticizer before Robotnik stole it. He was roboticized and made into one of Robotnik&#x27;s slaves, until Sonic restored his free will. He serves as a spy for the Freedom Fighters. According to Robby London, he was named after the writer and animator, Chuck Menville, who died in 1992.
* Ari Ram (voiced by Dorian Harewood) is a Freedom Fighter who worked as a double agent for Robotnik, only to be betrayed later and trapped in the Void. He is later rescued by Sonic and joins the Knothole Freedom Fighters.
* King Acorn (voiced by Tim Curry) is the former king of Mobotropolis and Sally&#x27;s father. He was banished to the Void during Robotnik&#x27;s takeover, and like Naugus, cannot escape without turning into crystal due to prolonged exposure to the Void. But before returning to the Void, he gives Sally the list of all the Freedom Fighter groups in Mobius, telling her to find them, unify them under her banner and establish a Freedom Fighter network so they can be strong enough to overthrow Robotnik once and for all.
* Lupe Wolf (voiced by Shari Belafonte) – Leader of the Wolfpack Freedom Fighters and one of the Knothole Freedom Fighters&#x27; allies in the fight against Robotnik.

==Production==
&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was created by DiC Animation City in association with Sega of America, which produced a total of 26 episodes for its two-season run, and the Italian studio Reteitalia S.p.A., part of Fininvest company in association with Telecinco. The show&#x27;s animation was outsourced to the Korean studio Sae Rom Production and Spanish studio Milimetros. Pre-production stages of the show&#x27;s first season (as well as the weekday syndicated show &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;) were handled by Canadian Studio B (later known as DHX Media Vancouver).

Before production began, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske and its newly appointed consumer products director Michealene Risley approached DiC Entertainment&#x27;s CEO Andy Heyward and the ABC network to produce a television show featuring Sonic. After being shown the character, Heyward agreed to make the show and was granted the license. According to Robby London, DiC originally made a deal to produce only the Saturday morning &quot;Sonic&quot; series for the ABC network, which was originally planned to air in the Fall of 1992. The cartoon was to be more light-hearted compared to the final product, as reflected by the episode &quot;Heads or Tails&quot;, early promotional material found in Fleetway&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; and the early issues of Sonic the Hedgehog comics by Archie, which were based on the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon. However, DiC also wanted to expand the show and produce additional episodes for weekday syndication as well, similar to what DiC had previously done with &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, but Mark Pedowitz, the then-senior vice president of business affairs and contracts at ABC, who expected the Sonic cartoon to air exclusively on ABC, rejected the idea, telling London &quot;If you guys want to do syndication, be our guest, go with God, but you won’t be on our network.&quot;

ABC would not agree to the deal until London came with a proposition that DiC would produce a separate, vastly different Sonic show for syndication instead, the result of which became &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Afterwards, ABC was at first willing to air only a single half-hour episode as a prime-time special scheduled to air in March 1993 (which would become the episode &quot;Heads or Tails&quot;) before ultimately delaying it and including it as part of the show which ABC picked up again for a full season, this time airing in the Fall of 1993, alongside &quot;Adventures&quot; airing in syndication at the same time. During that time, the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon received a makeover and was made darker and more serious in order to distinguish itself from the syndicated Sonic cartoon. The show bible for the Saturday morning Sonic cartoon was written in February 1992 with the final revision made on March 10, 1993.

===Season 2 (1994)===
==Broadcast and distribution==
===Initial run===
The Saturday morning series differs from &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, which premiered two weeks earlier and aired on weekdays in syndication. While &quot;Adventures&quot; is lighthearted and comical, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; featured a comparatively complex plot and dramatic atmosphere. It explored unusual story concepts for animation, including losing loved ones to war and relationships focusing on young couples.

While featuring a darker tone in comparison to &quot;Adventures&quot;, the Saturday morning show&#x27;s first season had an episodic structure and aired out of order, however the second season featured a story arc (which would&#x27;ve continued in the later seasons, had the show not been cancelled). At ABC&#x27;s request, the second season included episodes devoted to humor, while darker and dramatic elements were reduced. Other changes in season two include Princess Sally donning a jacket, Dulcy the Dragon being added to the cast and Rotor receiving a new design. ABC also ended up, in some weeks, airing back-to-back episodes of this show during the 1st season, while in Season 2, each time slot for the show was for a single episode only.

===Cancellation===
While the second season ended on a cliffhanger, a third season was planned, but before the production on it could start, the show was cancelled for a number of reasons. According to the show&#x27;s second season head writer, Ben Hurst in an interview found in the 2007 complete series DVD set, as well as archived conversations with fans online from the late 1990s, the show was cancelled due to being pre-empted for sport events, competing in the same time slot as FOX&#x27;s popular &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; and most notably due to ABC (who at the time entered a limited partnership with DiC Entertainment before becoming its owner) being bought by Disney and new people in charge coming in who weren&#x27;t interested in renewing the show. 

At the same time Hurst also denied the rumored reason for the show&#x27;s cancellation being DiC selling the show&#x27;s animation cels during the show&#x27;s run without telling Sega of America. This turned out to be not only true, but also the main reason for the show&#x27;s cancellation. According to the agreements between DiC and Sega from 1991 and 1992, Sega of America was the sole owner of both the Saturday morning and the weekday syndicated shows, as well as their original characters, props, backgrounds, design sheets, storyboards, scripts, cels, music, animation footage, etc. DiC, by selling the show&#x27;s animation cels, had breached their agreement, which led to Sega seeking legal action in 1995 and filing a prohibitory injunction on DiC, which would prevent them from continuing production on the show, thus ultimately ending the show&#x27;s run.

===Reruns, syndication and international distribution===
After the program&#x27;s initial run, it appeared on the USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Action Extreme Team&quot; block from June 1997 to January 1998. ABC did not replicate this, replacing &quot;Sonic&quot; with reruns of &quot;Free Willy&quot;. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; aired in Canada on the CTV Network, with a bonus summer run between June 10 and September 2, 1995. It has not been rerun on broadcast or cable television in Canada since its cancellation on CTV, but was present on the Shomi video-on-demand platform until its November 30, 2016, closure. In 2004, it started airing on Spacetoon TV in the MENA region until May 2015. All scenes with depicted romance have been censored due to federal laws in Saudi Arabia.

From 1994 to 1996, it had a complete run on the UK television on ITV and Channel 4, In December 1994, the first season was broadcast in the Republic of Ireland on RTÉ2. On September 2, 2016, reruns of the series began airing on Starz.

In September 2003, DIC revealed a new international package consisting of &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and the &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast&quot; special, titled &quot;Totally Sonic!&quot;. The package would also feature digitally re-mastered, color-enhanced versions of the shows with new contemporary music, as well as bonus director&#x27;s cut &quot;Secret Sonic&quot; episodes.

As of 2020, the show can be found on demand on Pluto TV on Paramount+, as well as YouTube. On March 15, 2021, it began airing in Malaysia on TA-DAA!.

===Home releases===
==In other media==
===Comics===

Archie&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book was initially based on the Saturday morning cartoon. From its earliest issues, the book shared the characters and story premise established within it. However, the comic differed in that it featured humorous plots modeled after the weekday show. After writer Ken Penders had the opportunity to view the Saturday morning program, the comic gradually became adventure-driven.

The comic series shifted focus again after ABC cancelled &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, developing into a relationship-based superhero story, and following a reboot, Archie&#x27;s &quot;Sonic&quot; was primarily inspired by the video game series. Nevertheless, the characters and locales from the Saturday morning cartoon remained prominent until the comic&#x27;s cancellation in July 2017.

===Video games===

Several video games were intended to use elements from the TV series, although only one was completed. This was &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot;, released in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. It contained characters from the show, including Princess Sally, Bunnie Rabbot, Rotor and Muttski. &quot;Spinball&quot; was commissioned due to &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; being pushed back from its intended 1993 release in the holiday shopping season to February 1994, with the game being developed in under a year. An 8-bit port of the game was also released for the Master System and Game Gear due to the poor reception of &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; in Japan.

Another video game tentatively titled &quot;Sonic-16&quot; was intended to be set in the same universe, with a prototype being created by Sega Technical Institute in November 1993. However, Yuji Naka and Sega management disliked the project, allgedly due to its slow-paced nature, and it was soon cancelled without any further development. Directly afterwards, the same team worked on &quot;Sonic Mars&quot;; this would have featured Princess Sally and Bunnie Rabbot as playable characters. This project eventually evolved into &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;, which was cancelled in 1996 due to development difficulties. Hackers also found within the data of the arcade game &quot;SegaSonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1993) a near-complete sprite sheet for the Robotnik design used in the cartoon, with it being speculated it was to be used in a scrapped English localization.

In the North American Sonic CD manual, Amy Rose is identified as Princess Sally.

=== Revival attempts ===
The co-story editor of the show&#x27;s second season, Ben Hurst, spent many years trying to revive the series through various media. He would go on to write for Sonic Underground, but due to the plot of the series already being set in stone by the time he, and his co-writer Pat Allee, came on board the series, they were unable to do so. Hurst would later state that, had he been brought on to the series first, he would&#x27;ve made it the third season of Sonic SatAM. He would also state that, if forced to include songs in the series, he would&#x27;ve either simply had it play over footage, or had Bunnie and Antoine (or Tails, according to his friend Allison Scharlemann), sing the songs.

Hurst would later attend San Diego Comic-Con in August 1999, meeting the head writer of the Archie Sonic comics, Ken Penders. Ben expressed interest in wrapping up the SatAM story in a comic, with him eventually being offered a Sonic Super Special. However, Ben eventually decided to pass on this. Ken said the reasoning was that he passed because Archie&#x27;s pay rates were much lower than that of animation writing. Although Ben would additionally state a while after this that it simply wouldn&#x27;t have been possible to conclude the series in a single comic, and would need at least 17 to 20 issues to properly conclude the story. Ken&#x27;s retellings of the story would also feature some contradictions, as in an earlier telling of these events, he stated Art Mawhinney, a storyboard artist for SatAM, would’ve been assigned to do the art for this Super Special. However, he would later on state that Patrick &quot;Spaz&quot; Spazinate was actually assigned to the pencils, with Ken likely having done the inking.

After this, Hurst looked into other avenues for continuing the SatAM story, with him considering the idea of either reviving the series for a third and fourth season, before considering the idea of instead concluding the story in a film. He&#x27;d eventually have a meeting with DiC executive Robby London on February 29, 2000. Hurst learned quite a bit about the animation industry, and realized that reviving the series for more televised seasons simply did not seem viable. While he said direct to video was more likely, he felt the best bet was to attempt to conclude the SatAM story as a feature film. Robby London gave Hurst the number of a Sega executive. &quot;My marketing strategy is simple: a great film could create an awakened interest in Sonic, breathe new life into the existing produced series and increase the marketing and merchandising possibilities for the little blue guy.&quot;

Hurst would eventually call said the Sega executive, explaining his idea for a Sonic feature film to her, to which they had a very pleasant conversation, and she said she&#x27;d like to talk again. The next day, Archie Sonic writer Ken Penders gave him a call, alerted by his contact in their office that he was interested in getting a Sonic movie going. &quot;I generously offered to include him in the effort and told him my strategy. Get SEGA to become invested in the idea by hiring us to interview their creative game designers, execs, etc and see if we could develop a story line that would fulfill the third season - and simultaneously give them creative ideas to develop new games. A win-win, situation.&quot; However, once he called Sega back, his contact&#x27;s demeanor had completely changed; they angrily stated that Sega is paid to develop Sonic projects, rather than paying others to do so. Hurst theorized that Penders had told them about their strategy in a &quot;less-than-flattering way&quot;.

While this event caused Hurst to briefly give up on trying to revive the SatAM series, he would eventually start working on it again once more. During 2003, Hurst would start writing a story document for the conclusion film, and, according to him, he had dozens of notes with story ideas on them.

In 2005, Hurst&#x27;s best friend (and husband to his sister) was diagnosed with cancer, and was given only months to live. After a long talk with him about their long friendship, the topic of Sonic came up once again. &quot;As we were discussing it, he reminded me that none of us know how long we will be allowed to stay here on earth. Then, he put his hand on my shoulder and informed me, ‘Ya gotta follow your dreams,’ and with a grin, he added, ‘Juice and jam time for both of us.’&quot; With this discussion, Ben decided to try and revive the film project one more time. His last plan to get the SatAM movie out was to get a completely separate movie out, and then use his name on that movie to pitch the SatAM movie. Len Janson helped write the script, a film entitled &quot;The Gift&quot;, loosely based on the story of &quot;Le Pétomane&quot;. However, this attempt also failed, with him saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think it will ever sell. It would be a monster hit, but Hollywood Execs are scared to death of it.&quot;

Hurst still never gave up hope, and apparently planned to try one more time, by gathering a group of fans together to make a presentation for Sega. However, this would not come to pass.

Hurst would later die in August 2011, and his good friend, Allison Scharlemann, would release what she had of Ben Hurst&#x27;s notes for the SatAM film. Allison would later share more details she remembered from her conversations with Ben on forums, the Ben Hurst memorial, and for &quot;Ben’s Vision - The Lost Sonic SatAM Third Season/Film&quot;, a documentary which told the story of Ben Hurst&#x27;s many revival attempts, and what was known of Ben Hurst&#x27;s plans for the unmade film/season.

=== Team Sea3on ===

From 2019 onwards, a group of fans calling themselves &#x27;Team Sea3on&#x27; spun out from the online &quot;FUS&quot; community (&quot;Fans United for SatAM,&quot;) and began work on bringing a third season of the series to life, basing the plot lines on both Ben Hurst&#x27;s original notes as well as the group&#x27;s active webcomic. The group are presently working within &#x27;proper legal channels&#x27; to advance the project with Sega&#x27;s awareness. The effort gained attention from the likes of IGN. In April 2022, a full teaser trailer was uploaded to the group&#x27;s YouTube channel, with a cover of the SatAM theme song &quot;Fastest Thing Alive&quot; by Johnny Gioeli of Crush 40.

==Reception==
&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; ranked No. 9 for all of Saturday Morning with a 5.2 rating, an estimated 4.8 million viewers during its first season.

Ian Flynn thinks that &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s&quot; story has too much attention on Princess Sally, giving Sonic the role of deus ex machina to deal with every episodes&#x27; conflict. Also, he noted the show&#x27;s &quot;90&#x27;s eco-awareness&quot;.

The first season received an approval rating of 40% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on five reviews. Patrick Lee of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave it a positive review, saying that &quot;the show pushed its cartoon animal characters to the most dramatic places they could go without venturing into self-parody. Over the course of the series, the characters dealt with loss, romance, and death [...] The entire series successfully pulled off that sort of balancing act, and even 20 years later, it’s still a solid Saturday morning cartoon&quot;. Mark Bozon of &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the show as dated, considering it &quot;so bad, it&#x27;s good.&quot; Writing for &quot;DVD Talk&quot;, Todd Douglass Jr. remarked that &quot;Sonic&quot; didn&#x27;t stand the test of time. Overall, he considered it to be of low quality, although he found the stories &quot;Ultra Sonic&quot; and &quot;Blast to the Past&quot; to be &quot;the crème of the crop.&quot;

Luke Owen of &quot;Flickering Myth&quot; felt &quot;Sonic&quot; aged better than is often supposed, praising its well-executed characterizations and treatment of war, although he considered Antoine to be &quot;one of the worst characters committed to a cartoon series.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; listed the show as one of &quot;the worst things to happen to Sonic.&quot; It criticized its plot and characters as &quot;unwanted&quot;. &quot;The Escapist&quot; journalist Bob Chipman credited the series with providing a viably menacing take on Doctor Robotnik, and an engaging narrative. Bob Mackey of &quot;USgamer&quot; wrote that the cartoon&#x27;s writing didn&#x27;t live up to its intriguing premise. In particular, he argued that the Antoine character perpetrated negative French stereotypes.

&quot;Sonic&quot; co-creator Naoto Ohshima later stated that he is a fan of the series and its characters, and that he owns a promotional cel given to him by DiC Entertainment during the show&#x27;s production.

<doc id="338497" wikidata="Q7521073" url="?curid=338497" title="Simpson College">
<text>Simpson College is a private Methodist college in Indianola, Iowa. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and enrolled 1,151 students in fall 2022.

==History==
Indianola Male and Female Seminary was opened on September 24, 1860, and the name was changed to the Des Moines Conference Seminary in September 1865. On September 21, 1867, the school was upgraded to a college and renamed Simpson Centenary College to honor Methodism&#x27;s most renowned living bishop, Bishop Matthew Simpson (1811-1884), and to celebrate the centennial of American Methodism. (Simpson is best known as the minister who spoke a eulogy at Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s funeral in Springfield, Illinois, in 1865; he was known as a great pulpit preacher.) Simpson himself gave the commencement address at Simpson in 1882. In June 1885, &quot;Centenary&quot; was dropped from the name, becoming simply Simpson College.

== Campus ==
The tree-lined campus is bordered on the north by Buxton Park Arboretum. The architecture blends tradition with modernity. The theater building, an example of the Brutalist architecture that dominated American campus construction in the 1970s, was renovated and added on to in 2010–11, softening its features.

Other notable construction includes the 55,000-square-foot Kent Family Campus Center, which replaced the old Brenton Student Center as the center of student life.

Simpson also renovated its outdoor track and football field. In addition to rebuilding the entrances and fences surrounding Bill Buxton stadium, the school invested in what has been dubbed the most innovative artificial turf system in the world, FieldTurf Revolution. A new-era Beynon BSS 1000 running track was also installed for the 2011–12 school year. The renovation of Simpson&#x27;s athletic facilities concluded in 2014 with the construction of a new bi-level weight room in the former pool area. This move was made possible by constructing the Indianola YMCA, which has a 25-yard pool and hosts swimming meets for Simpson College, Indianola High School, and the YMCA Tide swim team.

Simpson offers a variety of residential housing options, including two first-year-only residence halls, other traditional residence halls, apartment-style living, theme houses, and an active Greek system. All Simpson living facilities include air conditioning, lofted beds, carpet, furniture, social lounges, and wireless internet.

==Organization and administration==
The college had an endowment of $78.6 million as of February 10, 2017.

Simpson College athletic teams are nicknamed the Storm. They compete in the American Rivers Conference in NCAA Division III. Simpson fields men&#x27;s teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, American football, golf, soccer, tennis, track and field, and wrestling. Women&#x27;s teams include basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. Simpson also fields cheerleading and dance squads.

The Simpson College softball team won the NCAA Division III National Championship in 1997 and 1999. Simpson&#x27;s softball team appeared in one Women&#x27;s College World Series in 1971.

==Student life==
Simpson ranks among the nation&#x27;s top 100 colleges in the percentage of students who study abroad, according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

KSTM, 88.9, is a student-operated radio station.

===John C. Culver Public Policy Center===
The Culver Center was established at Simpson College in 2010 to honor the service of John Culver, a former Iowa Senator and Congressman. The program awards four-year scholarships to up to select incoming Simpson students who demonstrate a commitment to public service and civic engagement. The annual John C. Culver Lecture brings a prominent public service or political figure to campus to meet with students and deliver a lecture open to the public. Lectures have included Senator George McGovern, Political Journalist Mark Shields, Supreme Court Reporter Linda Greenhouse, and former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.

== Notable people ==

<doc id="338498" wikidata="Q499486" url="?curid=338498" title="Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)">
<text>Bank of America Plaza (colloquially called the pencil building) is a supertall skyscraper between Midtown Atlanta and Downtown Atlanta. At , the tower is the 23rd tallest building in the United States, the tallest building in the Southeastern region of the United States, and the tallest building in any U.S. state capital, overtaking the , 50-story One Atlantic Center in height, which held the record as Georgia&#x27;s tallest building. It has 55 stories of office space and was completed in 1992, when it was called NationsBank Plaza. Originally intended to be the headquarters for Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank (which merged with Sovran Bank during construction), it became NationsBank&#x27;s property following its formation in the 1991 hostile takeover of C&amp;S/Sovran by NCNB.

== Architectural details ==
The building was developed by Cousins Properties and designed by the architectural firm Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates LLC. Designed in the Postmodern style reminiscent of Art Deco, it was built in only 14 months, one of the fastest construction schedules for any building. The Plaza&#x27;s imposing presence is heightened by the dark color of its exterior. It soars into the sky with vertical lines that reinforce its height while also creating an abundance of revenue-generating corner offices. It is located on over on Peachtree Street.

There is a obelisk-like spire at the top of the building echoing the shape of the building as a whole. Most of the spire is covered in 23 karat (96 percent) gold leaf. The open-lattice steel pyramid underneath the obelisk glows yellow-orange at night due to lighting. At its most basic, this is a modern interpretation of the Art Deco theme seen in the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The inhabited part of the building actually ends abruptly with a flat roof. On top of this is built a pyramid of girders, which are gilded and blaze at night, with the same type of yellow-orange high-pressure sodium (HPS) lighting used in older-style street lights. Its design has been characterized as similar to the Messeturm in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

The skyscraper, built at a 45-degree angle to the city&#x27;s street grid, is set back off its eastern and western street boundaries, Peachtree Street and West Peachtree Street, by over 50 yards (45 m). This setback is filled, variously, by driveways, parking garage entrances, potted plants, granite staircases, and sloping lawns. The building directly abuts the sidewalk on North Avenue, its northern boundary, with access to this street through a parking garage entrance and stairs leading from the building&#x27;s main lobby.

Some urban planners decry the building as a Corbusian &quot;tower in a park&quot;, as it actively disengages itself from the urban environment surrounding it, entirely omitting sidewalk-facing retail space. Critics argue that the building encourages its tenants to access it primarily by car and to remain inside the complex during the day. However it is across the street from the MARTA-rail North Avenue station.

Developers have rumored that the land under the surrounding driveways and lawns may be redeveloped into low- and mid-rise mixed-use buildings with street-fronting uses as the area urbanizes and the value of land in Midtown Atlanta increases. In 2014, new sidewalks, pavers, ADA ramps, pedestrian light-poles, improved tree wells, new bike racks and landscaping were planned. These neighborhood improvements were completed by 2016 at a cost of $1.04 million.

Upon its completion Bank of America Plaza was the tallest building in the United States outside New York City and Chicago, and the 8th-tallest building in the U.S. overall.

== Renovations and sustainable building initiative ==

In 2014, a $30 million renovation to the lobby, health club, and conference facility was completed It has also achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification. The building and property management were awarded Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce E3 Liquid Assets, a recognition in water sustainability. Midtown Atlanta&#x27;s Midtown Alliance also recognized it as an EcoDistrict Green Luminary for its significant commitment to sustainability practices.

Beginning in 2016, $15 million will be invested over the next few years to significantly modernize the common areas including the lobby, west wing and some deferred maintenance.

== Building ownership ==

BentleyForbes acquired the building from Cousins Properties in 2006 for $436 million, a record price at $348 per square foot. In 2012, LNR and lenders acquired the property via foreclosure.

In 2013, CWCapital took over the asset management, sponsoring and representing the building&#x27;s bond holders from LNR and hired real estate services company Cushman &amp; Wakefield and property manager Onyx Equities.

In 2016, a fund managed by San Francisco-based Shorenstein Properties acquired the building. CBRE Group was hired to head leasing efforts.

The largest tenant in the building is Troutman Pepper, a law firm.

In 2022, CP Group, the second-largest landlord in Atlanta, and HPS Investment Partners acquired the iconic building in a joint venture for an undisclosed price.

== In popular culture==
The building appears as the headquarters of Westgroup Energy in the AMC period drama &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;.
This elegant tower frequently appears in cityscapes on the Netflix series The Resident.

<doc id="338501" wikidata="Q1856878" url="?curid=338501" title="Dingbats (board game)">
<text>Dingbats is the name of a puzzle franchise devised by Paul Sellers in 1980 and first published as a board game in 1987.

==Gameplay==
The game, for two or more people, involves solving rebuses: puzzles in which a common word or saying is hidden in a cryptic or otherwise unique arrangement of symbols.

==Publication history==
The puzzles are syndicated internationally in newspapers, under various names such as &quot;WHATZIT?&quot; in North America and &quot;KATCH-ITS&quot; in Australia.

The name &quot;Dingbats&quot; is a registered trademark in the UK and European Union.

==Reception==
In the February 1988 issue of &quot;The Games Machine&quot; (Issue 3), the reviewer said that &quot;We didn&#x27;t really think a awful lot of the game, it has a tendency to get annoying because of inconsistency in the difficulty of the puzzles - but good marks for effort and decent packaging.&quot;

<text>This is a list of [[board game]]s. See the article on game classification for other alternatives, or see Category:Board games for a list of board game articles. Board games are games with rules, a playing surface, and tokens that enable interaction between or among players as players look down at the playing surface and face each other. Unlike digital games, player interaction is not mediated by a system in board games, and ultimately the essential difference between board games and digital games is the medium.

==Single-player board games==
Some board games have solo variants, such as &quot;Arkham Horror&quot; and &quot;Agricola&quot;. Others are specifically designed for one player.

==Two-player abstract strategy games==

In abstract strategy games, players know the entire game state at all times, and random generators such as dice are not used.

==Two-player board games==
==Multi-player elimination board games==
Participants are typically eliminated before game end.

==European race games==
==Multiplayer games without elimination==
Everyone can play along to the end. These games are especially suited for mixed play with adults and children.

==Economics strategy games==
Games involving scarce resources and strategy.

==Games of physical skill==
Coordination, finesse, or other physical skills are necessary. Also known as dexterity games.

==Children&#x27;s games==
The rules are easy to learn and the outcome is mostly or entirely due to chance.

==Cooperative games==
Cooperative games in which all players need to work together to win.

==Word games==
These games are based on construction of words to score points.

==Gaming systems==
These are sets that can be used to play multiple games.

<doc id="338510" wikidata="Q537083" url="?curid=338510" title="Roger Norrington">
<text>Sir Roger Arthur Carver Norrington (born 16 March 1934) is an English conductor. He is known for historically informed performances of Baroque, Classical and Romantic music.

In November 2021 Norrington announced his retirement.

== Life ==
Norrington is the son of Sir Arthur Norrington and Edith Joyce Norrington née Carver, and his brother is Humphrey Thomas Norrington. He studied at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Dragon School, Oxford, Westminster School, Clare College, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music under Adrian Boult among others. Norrington played the violin, and worked as a tenor through the 1960s. In 1962 he founded the Schütz Choir (later the Schütz Choir of London).

=== Conductor in Britain and US ===
From 1969 to 1984, Norrington was music director of Kent Opera. In 1978, he founded the London Classical Players and remained their musical director until 1997. From 1985 to 1989, he was principal conductor of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta. He is also president of the Oxford Bach Choir. In the US, from 1990 to 1994, he was music director of the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s.

With his wife, the choreographer Kay Lawrence, he formed in 1984 the Early Opera Project to complement his concert work in period-style opera, beginning with Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino that year, and touring Britain in 1986.

=== From Salzburg to Stuttgart ===
In Europe, he was principal conductor of the Camerata Salzburg from 1997 to 2006, and principal conductor of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1998 to 2011. On 28 July 2016, he conducted the final concert of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra in London at the Royal Albert Hall as part of The Proms, before its scheduled merger with the SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg.

=== Other activities: Boston, Bremen, Zurich ===
He was artistic advisor of the Boston Handel and Haydn Society from 2006 to 2009. He was principal guest conductor of the Orchestre de chambre de Paris and the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen. He was principal conductor of the Zurich Chamber Orchestra from 2011 to 2016. He has conducted over 50 world premieres, and has appeared regularly with the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, and major orchestras throughout the world.

=== Historically informed performance ===
Norrington is best known for historically informed performances of Baroque, Classical and Romantic music. He is a member of the historically informed performance movement. Norrington has advocated a limited or no use of vibrato in orchestral performances, which has brought him both positive and adverse criticism. He has strictly followed Beethoven&#x27;s original metronome markings in his symphonies, rejecting the common speculation that these markings were &quot;miscalculated&quot;. He has conducted recordings of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Berlioz, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Bruckner, and Mahler on period and modern instruments. In particular, Norrington makes very sparse use of the vibrato, often uses very fast tempos, and varies the placement of the instruments on stage. Especially with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra Norrington has developed a very individual sound, which is often dubbed by the trade press as &quot;Stuttgart Sound&quot;. This refers to the synthesis of historically informed music making with the means of a modern and flexible orchestra. Symphonic cycles which Norrington interpreted in recent years with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra have received worldwide acclaim. 

There are many musicians who are highly critical of Norrington&#x27;s performance practice; for example, the violist of the Melos Quartet, Hermann Voss, drew two tough caricatures to Norrington&#x27;s vibrato-free string sound in 2005, adding: &quot;Except for the Stuttgart Feuilleton, the &quot;New Stuttgart Style&quot; finds only contempt and scorn.&quot;

=== TV ===
In August 2008, Norrington appeared in the reality TV talent show-themed television series, &quot;Maestro&quot; on BBC Two, when he led the judging panel. He conducted the First Night of the Proms in 2006 and the Last Night of The Proms on 13 September 2008.

=== Personal life ===
Norrington has been married twice. He and his second wife, Kay Lawrence, have a son, Tom.

== Awards and honours ==
He was appointed OBE in 1980, CBE in 1990 and Knight Bachelor in 1997. He is a patron of Bampton Classical Opera and the Orchestra of St Paul&#x27;s. He is an honorary fellow of Clare College Cambridge and holds honorary degrees from the Universities of York and Kent and an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Music.

<text>Stearic acid ( , ) is a saturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain. The IUPAC name is octadecanoic acid. It is a soft waxy solid with the formula . The triglyceride derived from three molecules of stearic acid is called stearin. Stearic acid is a prevalent fatty-acid in nature, found in many animal and vegetable fats, but is usually higher in animal fat than vegetable fat. It has a melting point of  °C and a pKa of 4.50.

Its name comes from the Greek word στέαρ &quot;stéar&quot;, which means tallow. The salts and esters of stearic acid are called stearates. As its ester, stearic acid is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in nature and in the food supply, following palmitic acid. Dietary sources of stearic acid include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and foods prepared with fats; beef tallow, lard, butterfat, cocoa butter, and shea butter are rich fat sources of stearic acid.

== Production ==
In terms of its biosynthesis, stearic acid is produced from palmitoyl-CoA, with malonyl-CoA a two-carbon building block (after decarboxylation).

Stearic acid is obtained from fats and oils by the saponification of the triglycerides using hot water (about 100 °C). The resulting mixture is then distilled. Commercial stearic acid is often a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids, although purified stearic acid is available. Commercially, oleic acid, as found in palm and soy, can be hydrogenated to give stearic acid.

==Uses and occurrence==
In general, the applications of stearic acid exploit its bifunctional character, with a polar head group that can be attached to metal cations and a nonpolar chain that confers solubility in organic solvents. The combination leads to uses as a surfactant and softening agent. Stearic acid undergoes the typical reactions of saturated carboxylic acids, a notable one being reduction to stearyl alcohol, and esterification with a range of alcohols. This is used in a large range of manufactures, from simple to complex electronic devices.

===Food===
Of the saturated fatty acids consumed in the United States, stearic acid consumption is second (26% of total saturated fatty acid intake) to palmitic acid (56% of total saturated fatty acid intake). Stearic acid is more abundant in animal fat (up to 33% in beef liver) than in vegetable fat (typically less than 5%). The important exceptions are the foods cocoa butter (34%) and shea butter, where the stearic acid content (as a triglyceride) is 28–45%. Examples of the use of stearic acid in food manufacturing include baked goods, frozen dairy products, gelatins, puddings, hard candy, and nonalcoholic beverages.

Stearic acid (E number &quot;E570&quot;) is found in some foods.

===Soaps and cosmetics===
Stearic acid is mainly used in the production of detergents, soaps, and cosmetics such as shampoos and shaving cream products. Stearate soap, such as sodium stearate, could be made from stearic acid but instead are usually produced by saponification of stearic acid-containing triglycerides. Esters of stearic acid with ethylene glycol (glycol stearate and glycol distearate) are used to produce a pearly effect in shampoos, soaps, and other cosmetic products.

===Lubricants, softening and release agents===
In view of the soft texture of the sodium salt, which is the main component of soap, other salts are also useful for their lubricating properties. Lithium stearate is an important component of grease. The stearate salts of zinc, calcium, cadmium, and lead are used as heat stabilizers for PVC. Stearic acid is used along with castor oil for preparing softeners in textile sizing. They are heated and mixed with caustic potash or caustic soda. Related salts are also commonly used as release agents, e.g. in the production of automobile tires. As an example, it can be used to make castings from a plaster &quot;piece mold&quot; or &quot;waste mold&quot;, and to make a mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered stearic acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form a thin layer of calcium stearate, which functions as a release agent.

Steric acid can be converted to zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. Stearic acid is a common lubricant during injection molding and pressing of ceramic powders.

===Niche uses===
Being inexpensive, nontoxic, and fairly inert, stearic acid finds many niche applications. Varied examples of stearic acid use in manufacturing include soaps and greases, household soap products, synthetic rubber, cosmetic and pharmaceutical creams and lotions, candles, phonograph records, lubricants, shoe and metal polishes, food packaging, and rubber compounds.

Stearic acid is used as a negative plate additive in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries. It is added at the rate of 0.6 g per kg of the oxide while preparing the paste. It is believed to enhance the hydrophobicity of the negative plate, particularly during dry-charging process. It also reduces the extension of oxidation of the freshly formed lead (negative active material) when the plates are kept for drying in the open atmosphere after the process of tank formation. As a consequence, the charging time of a dry uncharged battery during initial filling and charging (IFC) is comparatively lower, as compared to a battery assembled with plates which do not contain stearic acid additive. Fatty acids are classic components of candle-making. Stearic acid is used along with simple sugar or corn syrup as a hardener in candies.

==Metabolism==
An isotope labeling study in humans concluded that the fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 times higher than the fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to palmitoleic acid.
Also, stearic acid is less likely to be incorporated into cholesterol esters.
In epidemiologic and clinical studies, stearic acid was found to be associated with lowered LDL cholesterol in comparison with other saturated fatty acids.

<text>Christopher William Burford III (born January 31, 1938) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the Stanford Indians, serving as their team captain and leading the NCAA in receptions with 61 in 1959. The following year, he was selected in the first round of the 1960 AFL draft by the Dallas Texans.

==Professional career==
Burford caught 46 passes in his rookie season for the Texans, which went for 789 yards and five touchdowns. One of his touchdowns, which occurred in the Texans&#x27; first game, holds the distinction of being not only the first touchdown in franchise history, but the first points scored of any kind in franchise history. It was a 21-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Cotton Davidson. In 1961, he improved, catching 51 passes for 850 yards with five touchdowns to garner All-Star honors. In the 1962 season, he played in just 11 games and missed out on the AFL title run when he suffered a severe knee injury, but he caught 45 passes for 645 yards for a league-high 12 touchdowns to garner All-AFL honors. In 1963, he caught a career-high 68 passes for 824 yards for nine touchdowns. In each of those seasons, he led the team in receptions. He followed it up with 51 catches for 675 yards and seven touchdowns in 1964, although he played in only 12 games. 1965 meant just 11 games played, but he caught 47 passes for 575 yards and six touchdowns. He led the team in receptions for the fourth and last time.

In his penultimate year, Burford played every game and caught 58 passes for 758 yards for eight touchdowns as the Chiefs broke through for the postseason run. He made his only appearances in the playoffs during the AFL Championship Game and the first Super Bowl, making four receptions in each game. Burford played in nine games to close out his career in 1967. He made 25 catches for 389 yards and three touchdowns. In his last game against the New York Jets, he closed it out with two catches for 17 yards with a touchdown catch from Len Dawson. At the age of 29, he retired. By the end of his career, he was the Chiefs all-time reception leader (391) with 5,505 yards and 55 touchdowns.

For most of his AFL career, Burford was in the top ten in receiving catches, yards, and touchdowns. He was inducted into the Chiefs Hall of Fame in 1975 and in 2010 he was inducted into the African-American Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame. Burford, who is white, was nominated by his former black teammate Abner Haynes.

<doc id="338515" wikidata="Q1706824" url="?curid=338515" title="Truist Plaza">
<text>Truist Plaza is a 60 story skyscraper in downtown Atlanta. It was designed by John C. Portman Jr. of John Portman &amp; Associates and built from 1989 to 1992. In the mid-1990s, Portman sold half of his interest in the building to SunTrust Banks, which then moved its headquarters to the building and prompted a name change from One Peachtree Center to SunTrust Plaza. In 2021 the building changed its name to Truist Plaza, following a merger between SunTrust Banks and BB&amp;T. The building is also known as 303 Peachtree. The building has a roof height of 871 feet (265 m) and stands a total of 902 feet (275 m) tall, including its antenna. When completed, Truist Plaza stood as the world&#x27;s 28th tallest building and 21st tallest building in the United States. Currently, Truist Plaza is the 471st tallest building in the world, the 58th tallest building in the United States and the 2nd tallest building in Atlanta.

==History==
Architect and developer John C. Portman Jr. originally conceived this building in the 1980s commercial real-estate frenzy as a speculative office building. Its basic design elements, a postmodern square tower with an elaborate base and crown, represented a departure for Portman from his earlier International-style work, and are said to have been inspired by Philip Johnson&#x27;s wildly successful design for midtown Atlanta&#x27;s One Atlantic Center.

Ground broke in 1989 with great fanfare, but by completion in 1992, the bottom had fallen out of Atlanta&#x27;s real estate market and the building sat largely empty, nearly forcing Portman into bankruptcy and causing him to lose control of most of his real estate holdings. His architectural firm, John Portman &amp; Associates, located their headquarters in the building.

The two-level lobby is filled with many works of art, sculpture and furniture designed by John Portman. The light rotates.

==Recent events==
The building was one of several struck by the mid-March 2008 Atlanta tornado, however it did not sustain damage as severe as most of the other buildings just south of it. Several offices had to be temporarily relocated within the building due to broken windows.

LPTV station WDTA-LD relocated to the top of the building, from the even-taller Bank of America Plaza. Despite long being Atlanta&#x27;s second-tallest skyscraper, this is its first broadcast antenna.

The building has been since its construction the home of John Portman &amp; Associates Architects.

Atlanta&#x27;s Truist Plaza building is home to a peregrine falcons&#x27; nest in planters on a balcony more than 50 stories above ground. High above any natural predators, the planters offer soft substrate and afford some protection from harsh weather. Peregrine falcons have been nesting at Truist Plaza since 1997. This Georgia Department of Natural Resources&#x27; Wildlife Resources Division web-camera offers viewers a unique look at the peregrines nesting activities in real-time. (Note: The balcony is private and not open to the public.)

In October 2021, Truist announced plans to install signage on the crown of the building. The new signage was installed on January 23, 2022, which necessitated the closure of streets and sidewalks surrounding the skyscraper.

<text>One Atlantic Center, also known as IBM Tower, is a skyscraper located in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia. It is the third tallest building in Atlanta.

==History==
It is the third-tallest in Atlanta, reaching a height of with 50 stories of office space with a total building area of 1,187,676 sq.ft. When the slender concrete core was completed in October 1986, it was the tallest slipformed skyscraper in the country. It was completed in 1987 and remained the tallest building in Atlanta until 1992, when it was surpassed by the Bank of America Plaza, which was built on the northern edge of Downtown adjacent to Midtown. It was also the tallest building in the southeastern U.S. at the time of completion, surpassing the Southeast Financial Center in Miami. In the 1990s, IBM, along with other large corporations, changed financial focus to leverage assets and decrease real estate holdings. IBM sold this property, along with others.

==Design==
The building was commissioned by Prentiss Properties as a southeastern headquarters for IBM, a company responsible for many notable skyscrapers of the 1980s. A local and well known engineer, Blake Van Leer, was the lead engineer for the project. Van Leer worked on most of the major skyline projects in the area during the 70s and 80s. Aside from introducing Atlanta to the postmodern architectural idiom of the 80s, this tower is notable for essentially creating what is now the Midtown commercial district. Located at the then-remote corner of 14th and West Peachtree Street over a mile from Downtown, this building nevertheless opened nearly fully occupied and thus attracted developers to Midtown.

==Architecture==
The design of the building was influenced by the Tribune Tower in Chicago, which is most evident in the base of the building as well as the main body. The building&#x27;s exterior is clad in pink Spanish granite and culminates in a copper pyramidal top with a gold peak. The design includes gothic flourishes, most noticeably below the copper top of the building. At night the peak and ridges along the top are illuminated brightly, creating a glowing effect.

==Other phases==
It was joined in 2001 by the much shorter Regions Plaza building, which bears similar postmodern design and was constructed across the street as the second phase of the Atlantic Center development. Atlantic Center Plaza&#x27;s design and architecture are so similar that it has affectionately become known in Atlanta as the &quot;Mini Me&quot; building, named after the comical dwarfish clone of Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies.

==Development==
One Atlantic Center was designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects. As associate architect, Heery International, Inc. produced the contract documents. Both Atlantic Center Towers were constructed by HCBeck, now known as The Beck Group.

<text>Václav Neumann (29 October 1920 – 2 September 1995) was a Czech conductor, violinist, violist, and opera director.

==Life and career==
Neumann was born in Prague, where he studied at the Prague Conservatory with Josef Micka (violin), and Pavel Dědeček and Metod Doležil (conducting) from 1940 through 1945. He co-founded the Smetana Quartet, playing 1st violin and then viola.

Neumann made his debut as a conductor with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra in 1948, remaining as a conductor with that ensemble through 1950. In 1951 he became principal conductor of the Karlovy Vary Symphony Orchestra. He left that post in 1954 to become principal conductor of the Brno Symphony Orchestra (SOKB). In 1956, he began to conduct at the Komische Oper in Berlin; beginning with a celebrated production of Janáček’s &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot; on 30 May 1956. He toured with that production to Paris and Wiesbaden; conducting a total of 215 performance between the three cities. He remained at the Komische Oper for eight years, leaving in 1964 to become conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and General Music Director of the Leipzig Opera. He stayed there until 1968, when he became principal conductor of the Czech Philharmonic, a post he held until 1990 and again in 1992-1993. He was concurrently General Music Director of the Stuttgart Staatsoper from 1970 through 1973.

Neumann taught conducting at the Prague Academy for Music, where his students included Oliver von Dohnányi and Vítězslav Podrazil.

Neumann was particularly noted as a champion of Czech music, and made the first studio recording of Leoš Janáček&#x27;s opera &quot;The Excursions of Mr. Brouček&quot; in 1962.

Neumann can be seen conducting the Czech Philharmonic in a recording of the Dvořák Cello Concerto with Julian Lloyd Webber. This is featured in the 1988 film &quot;Dvorak - In Love?&quot; by director Tony Palmer.

<doc id="338526" wikidata="Q1142875" url="?curid=338526" title="Humoral immunity">
<text>Humoral immunity is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by macromolecules – including secreted antibodies, complement proteins, and certain antimicrobial peptides – located in extracellular fluids. Humoral immunity is named so because it involves substances found in the humors, or body fluids. It contrasts with cell-mediated immunity. Humoral immunity is also referred to as antibody-mediated immunity.

The study of the molecular and cellular components that form the immune system, including their function and interaction, is the central science of immunology. The immune system is divided into a more primitive innate immune system and an acquired or adaptive immune system of vertebrates, each of which contain both humoral and cellular immune elements.

Humoral immunity refers to antibody production and the coinciding processes that accompany it, including: Th2 activation and cytokine production, germinal center formation and isotype switching, and affinity maturation and memory cell generation. It also refers to the effector functions of antibodies, which include pathogen and toxin neutralization, classical complement activation, and opsonin promotion of phagocytosis and pathogen elimination.

==History==
The concept of humoral immunity developed based on the analysis of antibacterial activity of the serum components. Hans Buchner is credited with the development of the humoral theory. In 1890, Buchner described alexins as &quot;protective substances&quot; that exist in the blood serum and other bodily fluids and are capable of killing microorganisms. Alexins, later redefined as &quot;complements&quot; by Paul Ehrlich, were shown to be the soluble components of the innate response that leads to a combination of cellular and humoral immunity. This discovery helped to bridge the features of innate and acquired immunity.

Following the 1888 discovery of the bacteria that cause diphtheria and tetanus, Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō showed that disease need not be caused by microorganisms themselves. They discovered that cell-free filtrates were sufficient to cause disease. In 1890, filtrates of diphtheria, later named diphtheria toxins, were used to vaccinate animals in an attempt to demonstrate that immunized serum contained an antitoxin that could neutralize the activity of the toxin and could transfer immunity to non-immune animals. In 1897, Paul Ehrlich showed that antibodies form against the plant toxins ricin and abrin, and proposed that these antibodies are responsible for immunity. Ehrlich, with his colleague von Behring, went on to develop the diphtheria antitoxin, which became the first major success of modern immunotherapy. The discovery of specified compatible antibodies became a major tool in the standardization of immunity and the identification of lingering infections.
== Antibodies ==

Antibodies or Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins found within blood and lymph. Structurally, antibodies are large Y-shaped globular proteins. In mammals, there are five types of antibodies: immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin D, immunoglobulin E, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M. Each immunoglobulin class differs in its biological properties and has evolved to deal with different antigens. Antibodies are synthesized and secreted by plasma cells that are derived from the B cells of the immune system.

An antibody is used by the acquired immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. Each antibody recognizes a specific antigen unique to its target. By binding their specific antigens, antibodies can cause agglutination and precipitation of antibody-antigen products, prime for phagocytosis by macrophages and other cells, block viral receptors, and stimulate other immune responses, such as the complement pathway.

An incompatible blood transfusion causes a transfusion reaction, which is mediated by the humoral immune response. This type of reaction, called an acute hemolytic reaction, results in the rapid destruction (hemolysis) of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies. The cause is usually a clerical error, such as the wrong unit of blood being given to the wrong patient. The symptoms are fever and chills, sometimes with back pain and pink or red urine (hemoglobinuria). The major complication is that hemoglobin released by the destruction of red blood cells can cause acute kidney failure.

== Antibody production ==
In humoral immune response, the naive B cells begin the maturation process in the bone marrow, gaining B-cell receptors (BCRs) along the cell surface. These BCRs are membrane-bound protein complexes that have a high binding affinity for specific antigens; this specificity is derived from the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light polypeptide chains that constitute the variable region of the BCR. Once a BCR interacts with an antigen, it creates a binding signal which directs the B cell to produce a unique antibody that only binds with that antigen. The mature B cells then migrate from the bone marrow to the lymph nodes or other lymphatic organs, where they begin to encounter pathogens.

=== B cell activation ===
When a B cell encounters an antigen, a signal is activated, the antigen binds to the receptor and is taken inside the B cell by endocytosis. The antigen is processed and presented on the B cell&#x27;s surface again by MHC-II proteins. The MHC-II proteins are recognized by helper T cells, stimulating the production of proteins, allowing for B cells to multiply and the descendants to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells circulating in the blood. B cells can be activated through certain microbial agents without the help of T-cells and have the ability to work directly with antigens to provide responses to pathogens present.

=== B cell proliferation ===
The B cell waits for a helper T cell (TH) to bind to the complex. This binding will activate the TH cell, which then releases cytokines that induce B cells to divide rapidly, making thousands of identical clones of the B cell. These daughter cells either become plasma cells or memory cells. The memory B cells remain inactive here; later, when these memory B cells encounter the same antigen due to reinfection, they divide and form plasma cells. On the other hand, the plasma cells produce a large number of antibodies which are released freely into the circulatory system.

=== Antibody-antigen reaction ===
These antibodies will encounter antigens and bind with them. This will either interfere with the chemical interaction between host and foreign cells, or they may form bridges between their antigenic sites hindering their proper functioning. Their presence might also attract macrophages or killer cells to attack and phagocytose them.

==Complement system==

The complement system is a biochemical cascade of the innate immune system that helps clear pathogens from an organism. It is derived from many small blood plasma proteins that work together to disrupt the target cell&#x27;s plasma membrane leading to cytolysis of the cell. The complement system consists of more than 35 soluble and cell-bound proteins, 12 of which are directly involved in the complement pathways. The complement system is involved in the activities of both innate immunity and acquired immunity.

Activation of this system leads to cytolysis, chemotaxis, opsonization, immune clearance, and inflammation, as well as the marking of pathogens for phagocytosis. The proteins account for 5% of the serum globulin fraction. Most of these proteins circulate as zymogens, which are inactive until proteolytic cleavage.

Three biochemical pathways activate the complement system: the classical complement pathway, the alternate complement pathway, and the mannose-binding lectin pathway. These processes differ only in the process of activating C3 convertase, which is the initial step of complement activation, and the subsequent process are eventually the same. 

The classical pathway is initiated through exposure to free-floating antigen-bound antibodies. This leads to enzymatic cleavage of smaller complement subunits which synthesize to form the C3 convertase.

This differs from the mannose-binding lectin pathway, which is initiated by bacterial carbohydrate motifs, such as mannose, found on the surface of bacterium. After the binding process, the same subunit cleavage and synthesis occurs as in the classical pathway. The alternate complement pathway completely diverges from the previous pathways, as this pathway spontaneously initiates in the presence of hydrolyzed C3, which then recruits other subunits which can be cleaved to form C3 convertase. In all three pathways, once C3 convertase is synthesized, complements are cleaved into subunits which either form a structure called the membrane attack complex (MAC) on the bacterial cell wall to destroy the bacteria or act as cytokines and chemokines, amplifying the immune response.

<doc id="338533" wikidata="Q344023" url="?curid=338533" title="Eugene Ormandy">
<text>Eugene Ormandy (born Jenő Blau; November 18, 1899 – March 12, 1985) was a Hungarian-born American conductor and violinist, best known for his association with the Philadelphia Orchestra, as its music director. His 44-year association with the orchestra is one of the longest enjoyed by any conductor with any American orchestra. Ormandy made numerous recordings with the orchestra, and as guest conductor with European orchestras, and achieved three gold records and two Grammy Awards. His reputation was as a skilled technician and expert orchestral builder.

==Early life==
Ormandy was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, as Jenő Blau, the son of Jewish parents Benjamin Blau, a dentist and amateur violinist, and Rozália Berger.
His musical talents emerged early. Blau received his first violin lessons from his father at the age of three and a half and was proficient enough as a violinist to enter the Royal National Hungarian Academy of Music at the age of five, being the youngest student to date.
From 1909 a student of Jenő Hubay, he passed the finals in chamber music and in violin in spring of 1915.
From 1917 Blau undertook first tours in Hungary and Germany; among other things as concertmaster of the Berlin Blüthner Orchestra. In 1918 he became briefly professor for violin at his old university. From 1917 to 1920 he also completed a degree in philosophy.
Motivated by promises made by a dubious impresario, he emigrated to the US in 1921.

Until 1918 Ormandy used the stage name &quot;Eugen Blau&quot; in public performances, &quot;Eugen&quot; being the German equivalent of &quot;Jenő&quot;. About 1919, after the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he used &quot;Jenő B. Ormándy&quot;. At the time of his arrival in America in 1921, he was using &quot;Jeno Blau&quot;, but by 1925 he was going by &quot;Eugene Ormandy&quot;. The origin of the surname &quot;Ormandy&quot; is uncertain. Speculation that it was either his middle name or that of his mother appears to be unfounded. His father changed his surname to &quot;Ormándi&quot; on March 22, 1937, a few weeks before emigrating to the United States.

Arthur Judson, the most powerful manager of American classical music during the 1930s, first heard Ormandy when he conducted (as a freelancer) for a dance recital at Carnegie Hall by Isadora Duncan; Judson later said, &quot;I came to see a dancer and instead heard a conductor.&quot;

==Career==
At Judson&#x27;s instigation Ormandy substituted for the indisposed Arturo Toscanini with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1931. This led to an appointment as musical director of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, a post he held from 1931 to 1936. In this post he became nationally known in the US through his recordings, which included the first versions on disc of Kodály&#x27;s &quot;Háry János&quot; suite and Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot;. In 1936 he returned to Philadelphia as joint conductor with Leopold Stokowski. After two years he became the orchestra&#x27;s sole music director; he held the post for 42 years (1938–1980), before stepping down to be its conductor laureate. He took the Philadelphia Orchestra on several national and international tours, and appeared as a guest conductor with other orchestras in Europe, Australia, South America and East Asia.
Ormandy built on what &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; calls &quot;Stokowski&#x27;s voluptuous &#x27;Philadelphia Sound&#x27;&quot; and added further polish and precision. Despite, or even because of, this, among many music critics and others, as Harold C. Schonberg opined in a 1967 study, &quot;there was a singular reluctance in musical circles to admit him into the ranks of great conductors&quot;. He was thought superficial; Toscanini dismissed him as &quot;an ideal conductor of Johann Strauss&quot; and a similar remark is attributed to Igor Stravinsky. Donald Peck, principal flute of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, reports that a fellow flutist was won over when Ormandy conducted the Chicago in Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony; he told Peck that it was the greatest Ninth he had ever heard. The conductor Kenneth Woods ranked Ormandy 14th of the &quot;Real Top 20 of Conducting,&quot; saying,

Schonberg called Ormandy &quot;an excellent technician with a technicolored approach&quot;. &quot;Grove&quot; comments that Ormandy may have contributed to this image by concentrating on the late-Romantic and early 20th-century repertory that showed to advantage the lush sound he could command in works by composers such as Debussy, Ravel, Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Schonberg commented that Ormandy programmed very little Haydn or Mozart and approached Beethoven &quot;in a rather gingerly manner&quot;. He conducted much less new music than his predecessor, Stokowski, had done, but did not ignore it, and gave the premieres of works including Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot;, which is dedicated to him and the orchestra, Bartók&#x27;s Piano Concerto No.3, Britten&#x27;s &quot;Diversions for Piano Left Hand and Orchestra&quot; and music by Ginastera, Hindemith, Martinů, Milhaud, Villa-Lobos and Webern. He did not neglect American composers, and among premieres he gave were works by Samuel Barber, David Diamond, Walter Piston, Ned Rorem, William Schuman, Roger Sessions and Virgil Thomson.
Schonberg concluded his study of Ormandy with the words, &quot;Ormandy does not conduct with the overwhelming personality of a Furtwängler, or with the ferocity and clarity of a Toscanini, or with the immense knowledge and classicism of a Szell. But he has carved out an area for himself, and within it he is secure, a perfect workman and a sensitive interpreter. And it is an area that takes in a great deal more than Strauss waltzes&quot;.

In 1980, aged 80, Ormandy retired as chief conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, but continued to appear as its conductor laureate. His last concert was with his Philadelphia colleagues at Carnegie Hall on January 10, 1984. His tenure, as chief conductor and then laureate was the longest unbroken association between a conductor and a major American orchestra.

He died of pneumonia at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 12, 1985, at the age of 85.

==Awards and honors==
In honor of Ormandy&#x27;s vast influence on American music and the Philadelphia performing arts community, on December 15, 1972, he was awarded the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. He was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1976, and received of Yale University&#x27;s Sanford Medal. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1977. After Ormandy&#x27;s death the US Congress and President Ronald Reagan declared that November 18 would be &quot;Eugene Ormandy Appreciation Day&quot;, with a recognition ceremony held on that date at the Academy of Music.

==Marriages==
On 8 August 1922 Ormandy married Stephanie Goldner (1896–1962). &quot;Steffy&quot; Goldner had come to New York in 1921 from her native Vienna, where she had attended the city&#x27;s Academy of Music. Soon after arriving in New York she took a position at Capitol Theatre where Ormandy was a violinist. For more than a decade she was harpist for the New York Philharmonic, the only woman on its roster. The two later did broadcast performances on WABC radio, where Ormandy was one of the staff conductors.

In the fall of 1946, the couple parted. &quot;There is no talk now of divorce [...] It&#x27;s just a separation,&quot; Mrs. Ormandy reported. However, she later filed for divorce, decreed 4 August 1947 &quot;on grounds of extreme mental cruelty.&quot; Following the divorce she joined the faculty at the Philadelphia Music Academy while announcing plans to resume her performing.

On 15 May 1950 Ormandy married Margaret Frances Hiltsch (1909–1998) in a civil ceremony in Philadelphia. In a statement released by the Philadelphia Orchestra Association, the two were described as &quot;family friends for many years [...] Mrs. Ormandy came to the United States about 12 years ago from Vienna [...] shortly thereafter she became an American citizen. During the war years Mrs. Ormandy became a licensed pilot in preparation for the WASP training program. However, as the unit was then disbanded, she enlisted in the U.S. Navy and for two years was then stationed at Norfolk, VA., in operations work at the Naval Air Station.&quot; 
The couple remained wed until his death in 1985.

==Recordings==

Ormandy&#x27;s recording career began with the Minneapolis Symphony for RCA Victor in 1934 and included the first US recordings of symphonies by Anton Bruckner (No. 7) and Gustav Mahler (No. 2). He remained with RCA Victor after becoming music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1938. In 1944, Ormandy and the Philadelphians began a 23-year association with Columbia Records. His many recordings for Columbia include the first US recording of the Fourth Symphony of Dmitri Shostakovich and the first ever recording of Mahler&#x27;s Tenth Symphony in the performing version by Deryck Cooke. (Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra gave the first public performance of the Mahler/Cooke Symphony No. 10 at the express invitation of Mahler&#x27;s widow Alma.) In 1968, conductor and orchestra returned to RCA Victor, recording for the label until 1981. His recordings of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s Symphony No. 3, &quot;Organ&#x27;&quot; were considered the best ever produced by Fanfare Magazine which remarked of the 1974 RCA Red Seal recording with organist Virgil Fox: &quot;This beautifully played performance outclasses all versions of this symphony.&quot; The Telarc recording of the symphony with Michael Murray from 1980 is also highly praised.

Under Ormandy&#x27;s baton, the Philadelphia Orchestra had three gold records and won two Grammy Awards.

Ormandy&#x27;s first digital recording was a performance of Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; for RCA Red Seal in 1979.

<text>One Ninety One Peachtree Tower is a 50-story skyscraper in Atlanta, Georgia. Designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects and Kendall/Heaton Associates Inc, the building was completed in 1990 and is the fourth tallest in the city, winning the BOMA Building of the Year Awards the next year, repeating in 1998 and 2003.

==Tenants and history==

Throughout the 1990s 191 Peachtree was considered Atlanta&#x27;s premier business address. However, when two of its largest tenants, law firm King &amp; Spalding, and Wachovia moved to Midtown&#x27;s new 1180 Peachtree and Atlantic Station respectively in 2006, most of the building was left vacant. That same year, Cousins Properties purchased the building from Equity Office Properties, which marked a return to 191 for the company as it helped originally develop the building. Cousins relocated their headquarters to the building, signed a number of small tenants to subdivided space and in January 2008, signed an agreement with Deloitte to extend and expand the consulting firm&#x27;s current lease from , bringing the building back to 87 percent occupancy.

The building is located on the former site of the Majestic Hotel, which in the early 20th century was one of the city&#x27;s major hotels.

==Design==
The building was originally proposed in July 1987 at 48 floors. The building&#x27;s facade is made of flame finished Rosa Dante granite and the windows are made of gray tinted glass. Each &quot;tower&quot; possesses a rooftop crown that is illuminated at night. The lighted double crown figured prominently in night footage filmed by helicopter during the 1996 Olympics. The primary entrance to the building is through a soaring 102-foot (7 stories / 31 m) tall atrium adjacent to Peachtree Street in Downtown Atlanta.

<doc id="338535" wikidata="Q235996" url="?curid=338535" title="Jenny Shipley">
<text>Dame Jennifer Mary Shipley (née Robson; born 4 February 1952) is a New Zealand former politician who served as the 36th prime minister of New Zealand from 1997 to 1999. She was the first female prime minister of New Zealand, and the first woman to lead the National Party.

Shipley was born in Gore, Southland. She grew up in rural Canterbury, and attended Marlborough Girls&#x27; College and the Christchurch College of Education. Before entering politics, she worked as a schoolteacher and was involved with various community organisations. Shipley was elected to Parliament at the 1987 election, winning the Ashburton electorate (later renamed Rakaia). When the National Party returned to power in 1990, she was appointed to Cabinet under Jim Bolger. Shipley subsequently served as Minister of Social Welfare (1990–1996), Minister for Women&#x27;s Affairs (1990–1996), Minister of Health (1993–1996), and Minister of Transport (1996–1997).

Shipley chafed at the government&#x27;s slow pace, and in December 1997 convinced her National colleagues to support her as leader. Bolger resigned as Prime Minister rather than face being voted out, and Shipley was elected as his replacement unopposed. She inherited an uneasy coalition with New Zealand First, led by Winston Peters. The coalition was dissolved in August 1998, but Shipley was able to remain in power with the aid of Mauri Pacific, an NZ First splinter group. At the 1999 election, her government was defeated by the Labour Party, led by Helen Clark. Shipley continued as Leader of the Opposition until October 2001. Shipley involved herself with business and charitable interests since leaving politics, and is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders. She was found liable for $9 million for her role in the financial failure of Mainzeal, a construction company.

==Early life==
Born in Gore, New Zealand, Shipley was one of four sisters. Her father was Rev. Leonard Cameron Robson, a Presbyterian minister. After attending Marlborough Girls&#x27; College, she qualified in 1971 as a teacher through the Christchurch College of Education and taught in New Zealand primary schools until 1976. In 1973 she married Burton Shipley and settled in Ashburton.

==Member of Parliament==



Having joined the National Party in 1975, Shipley successfully stood in Ashburton, a safe National seat in the country areas surrounding Christchurch, in the 1987 election. Entering parliament at age 35, she was one of parliament&#x27;s youngest members.

===Cabinet minister===
Shipley rose quickly in the National caucus. In February 1990, while still in her first term, party leader Jim Bolger named her the party&#x27;s spokeswoman on social welfare. When Bolger led the National Party to victory in the 1990 general election, Shipley was reelected in Rakaia, essentially a reconfigured Ashburton. She became Minister of Social Welfare, and also served as Minister for Women&#x27;s Affairs (1990–1996).

In her role as Minister of Social Welfare, Shipley presided over sharp cutbacks to state benefits. Later, when she became Minister of Health in 1993, she caused further controversy by attempting to reform the public health service, introducing an internal market. National won another term at the 1996 election, but was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First. Shipley left the Women&#x27;s Affairs portfolio and took on several others, including responsibility for state-owned enterprises and transport.

In 1993, Shipley was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

==Prime Minister (1997–1999)==

Shipley grew increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with the cautious pace of the National-led government under Jim Bolger, and with what she saw as the disproportionate influence of New Zealand First. She began gathering support to replace Bolger in mid-1997. Later that year, while Bolger attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Shipley convinced a majority of her National Party colleagues to back her bid for the leadership. When Bolger returned to New Zealand, he discovered that Shipley had enough support in the party room to oust him. Facing an untenable situation, he resigned, and Shipley was unanimously elected to succeed him. As leader of the governing party, she became Prime Minister on 8 December 1997. On 21 May 1998 Shipley was appointed to the Privy Council, and was given the right to the style The Right Honourable for life.

Despite continued economic growth, the Shipley government became increasingly politically unstable. In particular, the relationship between National and New Zealand First deteriorated. While Bolger had been able to maintain good relations with New Zealand First and with its leader, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, the alliance became strained after Shipley rose to power. Finally, on 14 August 1998, Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet.

Shipley was nicknamed &quot;the perfumed steamroller,&quot; when she first became prime minister. During a later interview with Guyon Espiner, Shipley stated that female politicians were labelled differently in the media; she uses the example that male politicians are called bold where female politicians are called vindictive; although she notes that this is an observation, not something that hurts her personally. Shipley&#x27;s ascension to the leadership marked a shift to the right politically with subtle returns to the neo-liberal policies of the first term of the Bolger government. This was labelled by some commentators (usually critically) as &quot;Jennycide&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Jenny&quot; and &quot;genocide&quot;.

Shipley, along with the New Zealand Tourism Board, backed the quasi-national emblem of the silver fern on a black background as a possible alternative flag, along the lines of the Canadian flag, but she took pains to publicly dissociate herself from Bolger&#x27;s support for republicanism. As the debate continued in 1999, the Princess Royal visited New Zealand, and Shipley stated, &quot;I am an unashamed royal supporter, along with many New Zealanders&quot;. However, the debate was muted by the controversy surrounding Tourism Board contracts going to the public-relations firm Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, whose World CEO Kevin Roberts, also an advocate of the silver fern flag, was a good friend of Shipley.

The APEC Summit was hosted in Auckland in September 1999. Shipley met with the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, in one of only two state visits to New Zealand by a US president.

Shipley was the first Prime Minister to attend the gay and lesbian Hero Parade, being the first National Party leader to seek to make electoral overtures to the gay and lesbian voting public. She advocated lowering the alcohol purchase age from 20 to 18 and achieved this in 1999. This was part of her expressed desire to expand the traditional National Party voting base.

Shipley became a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers.

==Defeat and resignation==
Shipley led the National Party into the 1999 election, hoping to become the first woman to be elected prime minister in her own right. However, she was defeated by the Labour Party, also led by a woman, Helen Clark. This election was a significant moment in history for New Zealand as it was the first New Zealand election in which the leaders of both major parties were women.

Shipley served as the Leader of the Opposition until October 2001, when Bill English took over as National Party leader. She retired from Parliament in January 2002.

In the 2003 New Year Honours, Shipley was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a Member of Parliament.

==Health==
Shipley suffered a heart attack in 2000, leading to an emergency angioplasty procedure. She made modifications to her lifestyle and lost weight, though she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2004. She underwent gastric bypass surgery in late 2007.

==Life after politics==

After leaving politics, Shipley involved herself with business and charitable interests. In 2007, she joined the financial services firm Source Sentinel, and from 2009 to 2018 was chair of the Genesis Energy Limited board. , she was on the board of the New Zealand branch of the state-owned China Construction Bank. She resigned from the Bank&#x27;s Board after being prosecuted for her role in the collapse of construction company Mainzeal.

===Prosecution for insolvency of Mainzeal===

In December 2012, Shipley resigned from the board of directors of Mainzeal Property &amp; Construction (MPCL), which went into receivership on 6 February 2013. At mid-day on 5 February 2013 she was one of four independent directors who resigned from the board of Mainzeal Group Ltd. MPCL and Mainzeal Group Limited are part of the Richina group, controlled and majority owned by Yan Ci Lang (also known as Richard Yan). Mainzeal went into liquidation on 28 February 2013, owing some NZ$110 million. In May 2015, the receiver of Mainzeal, BDO, filed a civil lawsuit against the former Mainzeal directors, including Shipley, for an alleged breach of directors&#x27; duties. In February 2019, the High Court of New Zealand found that the Mainzeal directors had breached their duty to avoid reckless trading and assessed their total liability at NZ$36 million, of which Shipley&#x27;s share was assessed at NZ$6 million. Within a week of the Court delivering its verdict, Shipley resigned from her Chair of the China Construction Bank New Zealand. An appeal against this judgment was filed along with a counter claim brought by the original plaintiffs for a vastly higher award against the Directors. Both appeals failed. In August 2023 New Zealand&#x27;s Supreme Court upheld the long-contested judgements, determining &quot;“Mainzeal was balance sheet insolvent from 2005, albeit this was not apparent from its financial statements” and ordered the four directors, of whom Shipley was one, to pay $39.8m together with interest, although the liability of Shipley is limited to $6.6m plus interest.

===Honours===
Shipley accepted redesignation as a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit on 14 August 2009, following the reintroduction of titular honours by the Fifth National Government.

===Reality TV Appearances===
Also in 2009, Shipley appeared on an episode of the television reality/travel show &quot;Intrepid Journeys&quot;, where she visited Namibia. She later started a charity to help a school she came across on that trip called the Namibian Educational Trust. 
Shipley chaired Global Women NZ until 2015, and was replaced as Patron of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre by Graeme Dingle in 2019, and was the New Zealand National Heart Foundation&#x27;s campaign &quot;Go Red for Women&quot;.

<text>The Westin Peachtree Plaza, Atlanta, is a skyscraper hotel on Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, adjacent to the Peachtree Center complex and the former Davison&#x27;s/Macy&#x27;s flagship store with 1,073 rooms. At and 73 stories, a total building area of and a diameter, the tower is the fourth-tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere, and the 30th tallest all-hotel building in the world.

==History==

The first building on the site was the first official Georgia Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Atlanta, a Victorian-style home purchased by the state in 1870 at the southwest corner of Peachtree Street and Cain Street (later International Boulevard, now Andrew Young International Boulevard). After housing 17 governors of Georgia (each limited to a single term of office) until 1921, it was demolished in 1923 for the Henry Grady Hotel, named for &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; newspaper journalist/magnate and philanthropist Henry W. Grady. That and the Roxy Theatre were in turn demolished for the current building.

Designed by developer/architect John Portman, the hotel opened on February 27, 1976 as the Peachtree Plaza Hotel, managed by Western International Hotels. The hotel was Atlanta&#x27;s tallest building until 1987, when it was overtaken by One Atlantic Center. It was the tallest hotel in the world for a year, until it was surpassed in 1977 by its architectural twin, the Detroit Plaza Hotel, the central tower of the Portman-designed Renaissance Center in Detroit. It was also the tallest building in the southeastern United States, surpassing One Shell Square in New Orleans. It lost that title in 1983, when the Southeast Financial Center in Miami surpassed it. It was the tallest building in downtown Atlanta for 13 years until it was surpassed by 191 Peachtree Tower, which in turn was surpassed by SunTrust Plaza (then One Peachtree Center). It still has more floors than any other building in Atlanta, as well as the state of Georgia.

Western International Hotels was rebranded as Westin Hotels in 1981, and the hotel was soon after renamed The Westin Peachtree Plaza. The hotel was heavily featured in the 1981 film &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; starring Burt Reynolds. Stuntman Dar Robinson, doubling for Henry Silva at the end of the film, dropped from what appeared to be the Westin Peachtree Plaza, setting a record for the highest freefall (unrestrained) jump from a building in a film. In actuality, however, the stunt scene was filmed at the nearby Hyatt Regency Hotel, using its shorter but similar cylindrical-shaped Radius Tower.

==Architectural details==

The building is cast in reflective glass in a cylindrical shape that reflects much of the downtown skyline (though each of the around 5600 windows are flat and not convex). Another small cylinder runs the full height of the building on one side, and accommodates two scenic elevators. The uppermost floors hold the Sun Dial Restaurant and Bar, a revolving restaurant that offers panoramic views of the city and its environs. The top floor of the restaurant completes a full revolution every 30 minutes, and the bottom every 60 minutes.

When the building first opened in 1976, the seven-story tall lobby atrium rose out of a half-acre, fountain-filled indoor lake known as the &quot;lagoon.” The lobby bar was surrounded by large, oval &quot;cocktail islands&quot; which appeared to float on the lake and the entire area was decorated with tapestries, sculptures, cages with live birds and over 100 trees. According to a contemporary postcard, architect Portman designed this area &quot;as a modern interpretation of a Venetian Plaza&quot;. In a newspaper advertisement, the hotel called the lobby &quot;more like a park&quot; and claimed it was &quot;a total departure from any other you&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

Not everyone was impressed, however. In a humorous 1982 column dismissing the extravagance of modern hotel lobbies, George F. Will complained that &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Peachtree Plaza has a lobby that Lewis and Clark could not have found their way across&quot;. He compared the &quot;pond-like body of water&quot; to &quot;a Walden in everything but charm in which you can drown yourself, which you might wish to do&quot;.

Eventually, the lake was drained and lobby redesigned as a more standard hotel gathering place with carpet, chairs and sofas.

The hotel was also notable for its Peachtree Ballroom, which was the largest in Atlanta when it opened, seating 3,500 people. It has since been surpassed by the Georgia International Convention Center, which lays claim to having the largest ballroom in the state of Georgia.

==Broadcasting==
Several local broadcasters have transmitted from an antenna mast atop the building, beginning when it became Atlanta&#x27;s tallest, but declining since others have been built around it.

The original antenna once carried the signal of WUPA TV 69 from the time it first went on-air as WVEU, but that station moved because the Westin tower lacked space for an antenna to send the station&#x27;s digital television signal. Two LPTV stations currently transmit from the top: analog WTBS-LP 26, and digital-only WTHC-LD 42.1. , WTBS-LP is moving to the Bank of America Plaza, from the same antenna as co-owned WANN-LP/WANN-CD, and possibly future digital WTBS-LD 30.

The main FM antenna (the four large elements seen at the top of the mast in both outdoor pictures on this page) recently belonged to WZGC FM 92.9 (&quot;92.9 The Game&quot;), while a smaller antenna still carries backup signals for that station and previously for WVEE FM 103.3 (&quot;V-103&quot;), both owned by CBS Radio. WWWQ FM 100.5 (&quot;Q100&quot;, then “Rock 100.5”, now WNNX FM (“99X”) first used the same antenna when it moved to Atlanta, before it upgraded and relocated within the city, but it has since switched back. WSTR FM 94.1 (&quot;Star 94&quot;) also shared the main FM antenna with 92.9 when it was originally installed, with the power from both stations&#x27; transmitters being combined into a single antenna through a diplexer. Both WSTR and WZGC still list this as their allotment location.

There is also an XM Satellite Radio repeater.

==2008 tornado==


On March 14, 2008, the Westin, along with other neighboring skyscrapers, sustained moderate damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta, with over 500 windows broken. It was the first tornado to have hit the downtown area. The building reportedly swayed back and forth about two feet (more than half a meter) in either direction, as it was designed.

By 2009, the Westin was the only building in Downtown Atlanta to have not replaced its broken windows, which instead were still covered with black-painted plywood on the outside, and drywall on the inside. This is because the ¼-inch (6mm) uninsulated glass was no longer made by PPG Industries, and even identical new windows would look mismatched because of weathering due to three decades of hot sunshine. Additionally, new building codes require insulated glass that can withstand winds up to instead of , necessitating heavier and more expensive glass. Replacement of all 6,350 windows was expected to begin in June or July 2009 and continue from the top down until summer 2010 at a cost of over $20 million. Like the original, the new windows are also mirrored, but feature a slight bronze tint. Each pane measures and weighs with four panes required for each room. More than 600 tons of glass were to be recycled.

Skanska completed the Westin Peachtree Plaza exterior window renovation in September 2010. On November 9, 2010, renovation of the Sundial Restaurant at the top of the building was completed, repairing tornado damage done to it two years prior.

==Deaths==
*On March 22, 2016, 61-year-old employee Carolyn Robinson died after becoming locked inside a walk-in freezer. The hotel was fined $12,471 for exposing their employee to &quot;entrapment hazards&quot; and failing to ensure the exit door remained &quot;unobstructed/unrestricted&quot;.

*On April 14, 2017, five-year-old child Charlie Holt died from head injuries sustained in the Sun Dial restaurant, reportedly after becoming trapped between a wall and furniture. Charlie Holt got up from his seat at the table unnoticed by his parents. When the parents noticed him, he was already trapped against the wall and booth. The boy&#x27;s parents tried to break him free, but their attempts proved no avail and he received an injury to his head. The boy died an hour later at Grady Memorial Hospital. As a result, the restaurant itself is still open, but the rotation feature has been indefinitely suspended.

<text>Emperor Wen of Han (; 203/02 – 6 July 157 BC), personal name Liu Heng (), was the fifth emperor of the Han dynasty from 180 until his death in 157 BC. The son of Emperor Gao and Consort Bo, his reign provided a much needed stability within the ruling Liu clan after the unstable and violent regency of Empress Lü, who went after numerous members of the clan. The prosperous reigns of Emperor Wen and his son Emperor Jing are highly regarded by historians, being referred to as the Rule of Wen and Jing.

When Emperor Gaozu suppressed the rebellion of Dai (), he made Liu Heng Prince of Dai. Since Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s death, power had been in the hands of his wife, Empress Lü, the empress dowager. After Empress Lü&#x27;s death, the officials eliminated the powerful Lü clan, and deliberately chose the Prince of Dai as the emperor, since his mother, Consort Bo, had no powerful relatives, and her family was known for its humility and thoughtfulness. 

Emperor Wen&#x27;s reign brought a much needed political stability that laid the groundwork for prosperity under his grandson Emperor Wu. According to historians, Emperor Wen trusted and consulted with ministers on state affairs. Under the influence of his Taoist wife, Empress Dou, the emperor also sought to avoid wasteful expenditures. Historians note that the tax rates were at a ratio of &quot;1 out of 30&quot; and &quot;1 out of 60&quot;, corresponding to 3.33% and 1.67%, respectively. (These rates are not for income taxes, but property taxes, as the only ancient Chinese attempt to levy an income tax would come in the time of Wang Mang.) Warehouses were so full of grain that some of it was left to decay.

==Life==
===Prince of Dai===
In 196 BCE, after Emperor Gao defeated the Chen Xi rebellion in the Dai region, he made Liu Heng, his son by Consort Bo, the Prince of Dai. The capital of the principality was at Jinyang (, modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Dai was a region on the boundaries with Xiongnu, and Emperor Gao probably created the principality with the mind to use it as a base to defend against Xiongnu raids. For the first year of the principality&#x27;s existence, Chen, whose army was defeated but who eluded capture, remained a threat, until Zhou Bo killed him in battle in November or December 196 BCE. It is not known whether at this time Prince Heng, who was then seven years old, was already in Dai, but it seems likely, because his brother Liu Ruyi was the only prince at the time explicitly to have been recorded to be remaining at the capital Chang&#x27;an rather than being sent to his principality.

In February 181 BCE, Prince Heng&#x27;s half-brother, Prince Liu You of Zhao starved to death in prison. In March 181 BCE, Liu Hui, who was formerly Prince of Liang, was made Prince of Zhao; Liu Hui later committed suicide over his marital problems in July that year. After Liu Hui&#x27;s death, Grand Empress Dowager Lü, who was then in effective control of the imperial government, offered the more prosperous Principality of Zhao to Prince Heng, but Prince Heng, judging correctly that she was intending to make her nephew Lü Lu prince, politely declined and indicated that he preferred remaining on the border. The grand empress dowager then made Lü Lu Prince of Zhao.

During these years, the Principality of Dai did in fact become a key position in the defense against Xiongnu, and Prince Heng became well-acquainted with Xiongnu customs and military strategies, although the extent of his own participation in military actions was unknown.

===Accession===
In August 180 BCE, after Grand Empress Dowager Lü died and the officials made a coup d&#x27;etat against her clan and slaughtered them (during the Lü Clan Disturbance), after some deliberation, the officials offered the imperial throne to Prince Heng, rather than Prince Liu Xiang of Qi, the oldest grandson of Emperor Gao. The key to their decision was that Prince Xiang&#x27;s maternal clan was domineering and might repeat the behaviors of the Lü clan, while the clan of Prince Heng&#x27;s maternal clan, the Bos, were considered to be kind and humble. After some hesitation, Prince Heng, then 23 years old, accepted the throne as Emperor Wen on 14 November 180 BCE. His nephew, Emperor Houshao, viewed as a mere puppet of Grand Empress Dowager Lü and suspected of not being actually a son of Emperor Wen&#x27;s older brother Emperor Hui, was deposed and executed.

===Early reign===

Emperor Wen quickly showed an aptitude to govern the empire with diligence, and appeared to be genuinely concerned for the people&#x27;s welfare. Heavily influenced by his wife Empress Dou, who was an adherent of Taoism, Emperor Wen governed the country with the general policies of non-interference with the people and relaxed laws. His personal life was marked by thriftiness and general willingness to forgive. He was initially very deferential to Zhou Bo, Chen Ping, and Guan Ying (), who were instrumental in his accession, and they served as successive prime ministers.

Examples of Emperor Wen&#x27;s policies that showed kindness and concern for the people include the following:
* In 179 BCE, he abolished the law that permitted the arrest and imprisonment of parents, wives, and siblings of criminals, with the exception of the crime of treason.
* In 179 BCE, he created a governmental assistance program for those in need. Loans or tax exemptions were offered to widowers, widows, orphans, and seniors without children. He also ordered that monthly stipends of grain, wine, and meat be given to seniors over 80 years of age, and that additional stipends of cloth and cotton be given to seniors over 90 years of age.
* In 179 BCE, he made peace with Nanyue, whose king Zhao Tuo Empress Dowager Lü had offended with an economic embargo and which therefore engaged in raids against the Principality of Changsha (modern Hunan) and the Commandery of Nan (modern Hubei). Emperor Wen accomplished this by writing humble yet assertive letters to Zhao offering peace with dignity and by caring for Zhao&#x27;s relatives remaining in his native town of Zhending.
* In 178 BCE, after a solar eclipse (then viewed as a symbol of divine displeasure), he requested that officials give him honest criticism and recommend capable individuals for governmental positions. He also tried to decrease mandatory taxes and hard labor.

In 179 BCE, after some hesitation (during which he, apparently influenced by the theory of &quot;shanrang&quot; (), thought that maybe it would be more proper for him to find the wisest person in the empire and offer the throne to him, or that he should consider offering the throne to his uncle Liu Jiao (), the Prince of Chu; his cousin Liu Pi (), the Prince of Wu; or his younger brother Liu Chang (), the Prince of Huainan), he made his oldest son Liu Qi the Crown Prince and Prince Qi&#x27;s mother, Consort Dou, Empress.

In addition to Empress Dou, Emperor Wen also favored Consort Shen (). Despite her favored state, however, she only wore simple dresses rather than elaborate designs, as a means of savings.

Emperor Wen, during the early part of his reign, was often impressed with suggestions tendered by a young official, Jia Yi, but opposed by senior officials, he did not promote Jia to particularly high positions; rather, Jia was put into a rotation as a teacher for various princes. Jia proposed dividing the larger principalities ruled by branch lines of the imperial family, a proposal that Emperor Wen agreed with but hesitated to actually carry out, and he did not actually implement Jia&#x27;s proposal, which later might have prevented the Rebellion of the Seven States.

===Middle reign===

An incident otherwise uncharacteristic of Emperor Wen occurred in 176 BCE. Zhou Bo, who had been instrumental in Emperor Wen&#x27;s becoming emperor and who had by that point retired to his March of Jiang (, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), was falsely accused of treason. Instead of doing initial investigations first, Emperor Wen had Zhou arrested and incarcerated. It was only with the intercession of his mother Empress Dowager Bo and his daughter Princess Changping (, Zhou&#x27;s daughter-in-law) that Zhou was released, and the charges against him dismissed.

In 175 BCE, over the objections of Jia Yi, Emperor Wen issued an edict permitting any person to mint money (then only in the form of coins) out of copper and tin. The main beneficiaries of this policy were those with access to copper, including the court official Deng Tong (), a favorite and likely lover of Emperor Wen, who bestowed upon Deng a major copper mine in Yandao (, in modern Yaan, Sichuan). Another beneficiary was Liu Pi, the Prince of Wu, whose principality had a major copper mine at Yuzhang (, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi).

In 174 BCE, a major incident occurred involving Liu Chang, the Prince of Chen, who was by then Emperor Wen&#x27;s only living brother. Emperor Wen had great affection for him and did not punish him for using styles and ceremonies that only emperors were supposed to use. Also, contrary to imperial laws, Prince Chang issued edicts within his own principality and also commissioned his own prime minister. He also carried out executions and made titles for people—two powers that were also reserved to the emperor. 

Emperor Wen constantly excused him for his indiscretions—which included killing Shen Yiji (), the Marquess of Piyang—but eventually became unhappy. He asked his uncle Bo Zhao () to write a letter to Prince Chang to try to change his ways. Instead, Prince Chang was offended and planned a rebellion. When the conspiracy was discovered, Emperor Wen stripped Prince Chang of his title and exiled him to Yandao—with the intent to teach him a lesson and then summoning him back. However, on the way, Prince Chang died—probably by suicide. In 172 BCE, Emperor Wen, missing Prince Chang dearly and still lamenting his death, made his sons Liu An, Liu Bo (), Liu Ci (), and Liu Liang () marquesses, again over Jia Yi&#x27;s objection.

Also in 174 BCE, when the Xiongnu&#x27;s new chanyu Laoshang came to power, Emperor Wen continued the heqin policy by giving him a prince&#x27;s daughter in marriage.

In 170 BCE, Emperor Wen&#x27;s uncle Bo Zhao, who had been instrumental in his administration, killed an imperial messenger. Emperor Wen forced him to commit suicide. This incident drew criticism from later historians, who believed that he should have curbed Bo&#x27;s powers earlier and saved his life in that manner.

In 169 BCE, Chao Cuo (), then a low-level official, offered Emperor Wen a number of suggestions for dealing with the Xiongnu. Emperor Wen was impressed, and made him a member of Crown Prince Qi&#x27;s household. At Chao&#x27;s suggestion, in 168 BCE, Emperor Wen instituted the policy that if people contributed food for use by the northern defense force against Xiongnu, they could receive titles or have their crimes pardoned.

In 167 BCE, Emperor Wen banned the corporal punishments of facial tattoo and cutting off the nose or a foot, and replaced them with whipping. These punishments would not be instituted again as a matter of formal legal sentencing for the rest of Chinese history. (However, as was later noted, this actually caused more deaths, and so the amount of whipping was further reduced in 156 BCE by Emperor Jing.)

===Late reign===

Later in his reign, Emperor Wen became superstitious and started to search for supernatural events. In 165 BCE, at the instigation of the sorcerer Xinyuan Ping (), he built a temple north of Wei River dedicated to five gods. He then promoted Xinyuan and awarded him with much treasure. At Xinyuan&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Wen planned a thorough revision of the governmental system and the building of many temples. In 164 BCE, Xinyuan Ping had an associate place a jade cup outside the imperial palace with mysterious writings on them, and also predicted a regression in the path of the sun. (This phenomenon has never been adequately explained, but might have actually been a partial solar eclipse.) In response, Emperor Wen joyously proclaimed an empire-wide festival and also restarted the calendaring for his reign. (Therefore, the years 163 BCE and on, for the rest of his reign, were known as the later era of his reign.) However, in winter 164 BCE, Xinyuan was exposed to be a fraud, and he and his clan were executed. That ended Emperor Wen&#x27;s period of supernatural fascination.

In 158 BCE, when the Xiongnu made a major incursion into the Commanderies of Shang (, modern northern Shaanxi) and Yunzhong (, modern western Inner Mongolia, centered on Hohhot), Emperor Wen made a visit to the camps of armies preparing to defend the capital Chang&#x27;an against a potential Xiongnu attack. It was on this occasion that he became impressed with Zhou Bo&#x27;s son Zhou Yafu as a military commander; compared to the other generals, who, upon the emperor&#x27;s arrival, dropped all things and did what they could to make the emperor feel welcome, Zhou remained on military alert and required the imperial guards to submit to proper military order before he would allow the imperial train to enter. Later, he would leave instructions for Crown Prince Qi that if military emergencies arose, he should make Zhou his commander of armed forces—instructions that were heeded during the Rebellion of the Seven States.

Emperor Wen died in summer 157 BCE. He was succeeded by Crown Prince Qi. Emperor Wen, in his will, reduced the usual mourning period to three days, contrary to the previous lengthy periods of mourning in which weddings, sacrifices, drinking, and the consumption of meat were disallowed, thus greatly reducing the burden on the people. He also ordered that his concubines be allowed to return home. (Before and after Emperor Wen, generally, imperial concubines without children were required to guard the emperor&#x27;s tomb for the rest of their lives.)

==Legacy==

Emperor Wen&#x27;s reign and that of his son Emperor Jing were often collectively known together as the &quot;Rule of Wen and Jing&quot;, renowned for general stability and relaxed laws. He was considered one of the most benevolent rulers in Chinese history. His reign was marked by thriftiness and attempts to reduce burdens on the people, with one of the lowest tax rate in Chinese history was recorded. Two years after his death, the tax rate was as low as 3.3% of one&#x27;s personal income. Wen was buried in the , which took two groups of sixteen thousand and fifteen thousand workers.

The benevolent way of ruling of Emperor Wen was influenced by the philosophy of Confucianism. Confucian scholar Jia Yi was the mastermind behind Emperor Wen&#x27;s policy. He strongly emphasized the importance of agriculture, as well as egalitarian wealth distribution, according to the doctrines of Confucius.

Emperor Wen was also noted for his filial piety, and he was listed as one of &quot;The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars&quot;. According to one story, Emperor Wen&#x27;s mother fell ill for three years, and Emperor Wen tended her whenever he was available. He also personally tasted all the soups and medicines that were served for his mother&#x27;s treatment first to make sure they were adequate before serving them to his mother.

==Era names==
These &quot;era names&quot; are not true &quot;era names&quot;, but are retrospective, in the sense that the era-name system, as instituted by Emperor Wen&#x27;s grandson Emperor Wu, had not yet come into effect. Emperor Wen, in accordance with prior imperial calendrical systems, would have simply referred to the number of years in his reign. But he reset the calendar once at the persuasion of the sorcerer Xinyuan Ping (), thus historians need to refer to the eras before and after the resetting separately.

<doc id="338546" wikidata="Q3500583" url="?curid=338546" title="Georgia-Pacific Tower">
<text>Georgia-Pacific Center is a , 1,567,011 sq.ft skyscraper in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It contains 52 stories of office space and was finished in 1982. Before the six-year era of tall skyscrapers to be built in Atlanta, it was Atlanta&#x27;s second-tallest building (only surpassed by the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel) from 1982 to 1987. It has a stair-like design that staggers down to the ground, and is clad in pink granite quarried from Marble Falls, Texas.

The tower is on the former site of the Loew&#x27;s Grand Theatre, where the premiere for the 1939 film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was held (133 Peachtree St. NE, near the intersection of Peachtree and Forsyth streets). The theatre could not be demolished because of its landmark status; it burned down in 1978, clearing the way for the tower.

The architectural firm that designed it was Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. The general contractor who constructed the project was a joint venture of J.A. Jones Construction Company&#x27;s Atlanta office and the H.J. Russell Company, also of Atlanta. The tower is the world headquarters of Georgia-Pacific. Other tenants include consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company and the downtown branch of the High Museum of Art, which opened in 1986.

On March 14, 2008, the tower sustained minor damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta. A number of windows were blown out. It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in the 1880s.

The Consulate-General of the United Kingdom is located in the building. The building served as a filming location for the 1985 action film &quot;Invasion U.S.A.&quot; starring Chuck Norris and Richard Lynch, in which it served as the setting for the final battle between the U.S. Army and the army of international terrorists.

<doc id="338548" wikidata="Q6879148" url="?curid=338548" title="Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party">
<text>The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), also referred to simply as the Freedom Democratic Party, was an American political party that existed in the state of Mississippi from 1964 to 1968 during the Civil Rights Movement. Created as the partisan political branch of the Freedom Democratic organization (a contemporary Civil Rights activist group aligned with the national United States Democratic Party), the party was organized by African Americans and White Americans from Mississippi who were sympathetic to the Civil Rights Movement. 

==Origins==
In Mississippi, African Americans were restricted from registering and voting by means of intimidation, harassment, terror, and complicated literacy tests. They had been limited from participation in the political system since 1890 by passage that year of a new state constitution, and by the practices of the governing white Democrats in the decades since, with participation in the state Democratic Party limited to whites. Starting in 1961, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) had implemented campaigns to register black voters.

In June 1963, African Americans attempted to cast votes in the Mississippi primary election but were prevented from doing so. This contest to determine Democratic candidates was essentially the only competitive race, as the state was a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party jurisdiction under the control of the Mississippi Democratic Party. Unable to vote in the official election, an alternative &quot;Freedom Ballot&quot; was organized to take place at the same time as the scheduled November voting. With this election seen as a protest action to dramatize the denial of their constitutional voting rights, close to 80,000 people cast freedom ballots for an integrated slate of candidates. In response, James W. Wright, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, and Bob Moses, founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in 1964. As a result, they encountered violent opposition that included activists being intimidated with church, home, and business burnings and bombings, beatings, and arrests.

==Building the party==
With partial participation in the regular Mississippi Democratic Party blocked by segregationists, the COFO built on the success of the Freedom Ballot by formally establishing the MFDP in April 1964 as a non-discriminatory, non-exclusionary rival to the regular party organization. The MFDP hoped to become the officially recognized Democratic Party organization in Mississippi by winning the Mississippi seats at the 1964 Democratic National Convention for a slate of delegates elected by some black and white Mississippians.

Building the MFDP was a major thrust of the Freedom Summer project. After it proved to be impossible to register black voters against the opposition of state officials, Freedom Summer volunteers switched to building the MFDP using a simple, alternate process of signing up party supporters. This new process did not require people to take unfair literacy tests or to register for voting at the courthouse in public opposition to existing power structures. 

By the end of August 1964, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party had gained so much attention nationally that its delegates had 80,000 members belonging to their racially integrated party.

In time, some activists from the Northeast, including some of the Freedom Riders, would come to dominate the administration of the new party.

== State Convention in Jackson, Mississippi==
On August 4, before the state convention, the bodies of James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were discovered buried in an earthen dam. They had been workers with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), registering people to vote for the MFDP, and had been murdered for their activism. Missing for weeks since disappearing after investigating a church burning in June 1964, they were subjects of a massive manhunt that involved the FBI and United States sailors from a nearby base. The murders drew national attention and generated outrage, emboldening the MFDP to be the party to represent the state of Mississippi.

On August 6, 1964, the MFDP held a statewide convention before attending the DNC; 2,500 people showed up at the Masonic Temple. They decided to take the party to the national credentials committee and attempt to be seated as the delegation from Mississippi. Joseph Rauh, the MFDP legal counsel and a foremost civil liberties attorney, spoke at the convention. He said that the MFDP was the only party in the state loyal to the national Democratic Party and that its chances of success were excellent.

Ella Baker was the keynote speaker at the state convention. She did not deliver the kind of address that the people were expecting on voting and rights but made a statement about society:

I&#x27;m not trying to make you feel good. We have to know what we are dealing with and we can&#x27;t deal with things just because we feel we ought to have our rights. We have to deal with them on the basis of knowledge that we gain ... through sending our children through certain kinds of courses, through sitting down and reading at night instead of spending our time at the television and radio just listening to what&#x27;s on. But we must spend our time reading some of things that help us to understand this South we live in.

The state convention gave the MFDP confidence in their ability to effect change on the national level. They elected Fannie Lou Hamer, E.W. Steptoe, Winson Hudson, Hazel Palmer, Victoria Gray, Rev. Ed King, Aaron Henry and Annie Devine as electors from the state to the national convention. The day after the state convention, James Chaney was buried in his hometown of Meridian, Mississippi. Dave Dennis gave an impassioned speech about the loss of this young man.

Those are the people who don&#x27;t care. ... That includes the President on down to the governor of the state of Mississippi ... I blame the people in Washington D.C., and on down in the state of Mississippi for what happened just as much as I blame those who pulled the trigger. ... He&#x27;s got his freedom, and we&#x27;re still fighting for ours.

In the face of unrelenting violence and economic retaliation by the White Citizens Council, the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, and other opponents, the MFDP held local caucuses, county assemblies, and a statewide convention (as prescribed by Democratic Party rules) to elect 68 delegates (including four whites) to the 1964 Democratic National Convention scheduled for Atlantic City, New Jersey in August.

==1964 Democratic National Convention==

The MFDP sent its elected delegates by bus to the convention. They challenged the right of the Mississippi Democratic Party&#x27;s delegation to participate in the convention, claiming that the regulars had been illegally elected in a completely segregated process that violated both party regulations and federal law, and that the regulars had no intention to support President Lyndon B. Johnson, the party&#x27;s candidate, in the November election. They asked that the MFDP delegates be seated rather than the segregationist regulars.

Some of the original members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation in 1964 were Lawrence Guyot, Peggy J. Conner, Victoria Gray, Edwin King, Aaron Henry, James W. Wright, Fannie Lou Hamer, Annie Devine, and Bob Moses.

Martin Luther King told President Johnson that he would &quot;do everything in my power to urge (The MFDP) being seated as the only democratically constituted delegation from Mississippi.&quot; King also voiced his support to Congress, &quot;I pledge myself and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the fullest support of the challenges of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party and call upon all Americans to join with me in this commitment.&quot;

The Democratic Party referred the challenge to the convention credentials committee. The MFDP delegates lobbied and argued their case, and large groups of supporters and volunteers established an around-the-clock picket line on the boardwalk just outside the convention. The MFDP prepared a legal brief detailing the reasons why the &quot;regular&quot; Mississippi delegation did not adequately represent their state&#x27;s residents, including the tactics employed to exclude participation by Black citizens. Jack Minnis wrote, &quot;MFDP, with the help of SNCC, produced brochures, mimeographed biographies of the MFDP delegates, histories of the MFDP, legal arguments, historical arguments, moral arguments&quot; that were distributed to all of the convention&#x27;s delegates. Their actions attracted considerable publicity.

The credentials committee televised its proceedings, which allowed the nation to see and hear the testimony of the MFDP delegates, particularly the testimony of Fannie Lou Hamer. She gave a moving and evocative portrayal of her hard brutalized life as a sharecropper on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta and the retaliation inflicted on her for trying to register to vote.

After that, most knowledgeable observers thought the majority of the delegates were ready to unseat the regulars and seat the MFDP delegates in their place. But some of the all-white delegations from other southern states threatened to leave the convention and bolt the party (as they had done in previous years) if the regular Mississippi delegation was unseated. President Johnson had wanted a convention stressing unity and feared losing Southern support in the coming campaign against Republican Party candidate Barry Goldwater. To ensure his victory in November, Johnson maneuvered to prevent the MFDP from replacing the regulars. After a frantic scramble, he ordered the chairman of the credentials committee to avoid deciding the matter or sending the issue to the convention.

With the help of Senator Hubert Humphrey (a potential candidate for vice president) and Party leader Walter Mondale, Johnson engineered a &quot;compromise&quot; in which the national Democratic Party offered the MFDP two at-large seats, rather than replacing the regular Democratic delegates from their state. This allowed them to watch the floor proceedings but not take part. The MFDP refused this &quot;compromise&quot;, which permitted the white-only regulars, who had not been democratically elected, to keep their seats and denied votes to the MFDP.

MFDP leader and Mississippi NAACP President Aaron Henry stated:

Now, Lyndon made the typical white man&#x27;s mistake: Not only did he say, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got two votes,&#x27; which was too little, but he told us to whom the two votes would go. He&#x27;d give me one and Ed King one; that would satisfy. But, you see, he didn&#x27;t realize that sixty-four of us came up from Mississippi on a Greyhound bus, eating cheese and crackers and bologna all the way there; we didn&#x27;t have no money. Suffering the same way. We got to Atlantic City; we put up in a little hotel, three or four of us in a bed, four or five of us on the floor. You know, we suffered a common kind of experience, the whole thing. But now, what kind of fool am I, or what kind of fool would Ed have been, to accept gratuities for ourselves? You say, Ed and Aaron can get in but the other sixty-two can&#x27;t. This is typical white man picking black folks&#x27; leaders, and that day is just gone.

The MFDP was willing to accept a compromise proposed by Oregon Congresswoman Edith Green, that &quot;loyal&quot; Democrats of both delegations be seated. This compromise was not accepted by the national party, which instead selected the &quot;regular&quot; party to represent the state of Mississippi, those who, on July 28, 1964, had passed the following resolution:

We opposed, condemn and deplore the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ... We believe in separation of the races in all phases of our society. It is our belief that the separation of the races is necessary for the peace and tranquility of all the people of Mississippi and the continuing good relationship which has existed over the years ...

The MFDP left the Convention rather than be compromised by accepting the two seats. President Johnson had tried to prevent Fannie Lou Hamer from making her speech. After the United States heard her speech, different parts of the population were outraged and began calling into the White House seeking justice for African Americans in the South. The next year President Johnson persuaded Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized the federal government to oversee elections at the state and local level, and enforce practices that would support legitimate voter registration and voting in areas with an historic under-representation of certain parts of the population.

Fannie Lou Hamer said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t come all this way for no two seats, &#x27;cause all of us is tired.&quot;
Although denied official recognition, the MFDP kept up their agitation within the convention. When all but three of the regular Mississippi delegates left because they refused to support Johnson against Goldwater, the Republican Party candidate, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic northern delegates and took the vacated seats. The national Party would not allow them to stay. The next day the MFDP delegates returned to discover that convention organizers had removed the empty seats; they stayed to sing freedom songs.

Johnson lost Mississippi in the 1964 presidential election, as whites had still suppressed the black vote. White Democrats were becoming more conservative and voted for Goldwater. With the exception of the 1976 presidential election, when favorite son Jimmy Carter of Georgia was the Democratic candidate, Mississippi has never voted for the Democratic presidential candidate since.

==Aftermath==
The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP. For a while, it became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited Malcolm X to speak and opposed the war in Vietnam.

For the better part of a year after hosting the statewide mock election in November 1963, most of the organization&#x27;s efforts went into challenging the seating of the elected congresspersons of Mississippi to the U.S. House of Representatives. They argued to Congress that, because of the state&#x27;s disfranchisement, half of the electorate was prevented from participating in the election of those representatives. The FDP had 149 votes in Congress supporting its position; however, the House leadership (dominated by senior Southern Democrats) and Johnson&#x27;s White House were appalled at this idea and rejected overturning the Democratic representatives from Mississippi.

Many Civil Rights Movement activists felt betrayed by Johnson, Humphrey, and the liberal establishment. The movement had been promised that if it concentrated on voter registration rather than protests, it would be supported by the federal government and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Instead, at the decisive moment, they believed that black civil rights and justice had been sacrificed for the political interests of white politicians. As SNCC Chairman John Lewis later wrote:

As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this was the turning point of the civil rights movement. I&#x27;m absolutely convinced of that. Until then, despite every setback and disappointment and obstacle we had faced over the years, the belief still prevailed that the system would work, the system would listen, the system would respond. Now, for the first time, we had made our way to the very center of the system. We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face.

Though the MFDP failed to unseat the regulars at the convention, they did succeed in publicizing the violence and injustice by which the white power structure governed Mississippi and disenfranchised black citizens. The dramatic elements of the MFDP and its convention challenge eventually helped gain congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The MFDP actions resulted in the national party adopting a new policy: its credentials committee banned seating delegations that had been chosen through racial discrimination. The MFDP continued as an alternate for several years as African Americans began to register and vote in the regular political system. Many of the people associated with it continued to press to implement civil rights in Mississippi. After passage of the Voting Rights Act, the number of registered black voters in Mississippi grew dramatically. The regular party stopped discriminating against blacks and agreed to conform to the Democratic Party rules guaranteeing fair participation. Eventually, the MFDP merged into the regular party and many MFDP activists became party leaders. The FDP has only one active chapter, in Holmes County.

After the MFDP was disbanded, many formed a new party, the Loyal Democrats of Mississippi. In 1968, they were successful at the DNC in being seated as the only delegation from Mississippi. Several of these delegates were members of the MFDP.

Militants, including John Buffington (S. N. C. C. (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) field worker in Clay County, chairman of the Clay County Community Development Organization and member of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party) and Rudy A. Shields (S. N. C. C. (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) field worker in Copiah County), challenged the white Mississippi power structure, economically and electorally. They were charged with the firebombing of the office of the Clay County Community Development Organization on 24 January 1970. The next day, dynamite exploded the Clay County Courthouse. A grand jury declined to indict them. Several months later, one of the militants, John Thomas, Jr., was assassinated, in broad daylight, and the accused killer was found not guilty, claiming self-defense.

<doc id="338550" wikidata="Q7249706" url="?curid=338550" title="Promenade II">
<text>Promenade (formerly Promenade II) is a tall skyscraper in Midtown Atlanta. It has 40 stories of office space and its construction was completed in 1990. It is currently the seventh-tallest skyscraper in Atlanta.

Set just off Peachtree Street on 15th Street, it sits on the same block as One Atlantic Center and was only the second major office tower in Midtown. It is set diagonally to the street grid to maximize its impact on the skyline and allow tenants better views. It is clad in reflective glass and has a ziggurat-like tapering spire with stainless steel fins that are lit at night. Promenade was intended to be the first of three towers of identical design on the block that it occupies. The two other towers, of 48 and 58 stories, were never built due to the collapse of the commercial real estate market in the early 1990s. Promenade itself was originally planned for (57 stories) but was scaled back before completion due to the market collapse. The land they were to occupy is now home to the 41-story 1180 Peachtree Street office tower.

The architectural firms that worked on this project were Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback &amp; Associates (TVS) and the Ai Group. TVS, which was also responsible for the Concourse at Landmark Center highrise development on Atlanta&#x27;s northern edge, had its headquarters in the building until it moved to 1200 Peachtree Street in 2023. The engineering firm that worked on the Promenade was Thompson Company, Inc. (TCI). TCI is also responsible for the Concourse at Landmark Center.

On August 22, 2014, one of the largest tenants in Promenade II filed a lawsuit in an attempt to stop owner Cousins from placing signage on three sites of the tower. In a court filing in support of the legal action, Thomas Ventulett III, one of the lead architects on Promenade II, said the signage would &quot;certainly diminish the dignified character and aesthetic design of the spire and lighting at the top of the building.&quot;

<text>Tower Square (formerly known as BellSouth Center, Southern Bell Center, and AT&amp;T Midtown Center I) is a , 47-story skyscraper located in Midtown Atlanta Georgia. Completed in 1982, it served as the regional headquarters of BellSouth Telecommunications, which does business as AT&amp;T Southeast, and was acquired as part of AT&amp;T&#x27;s acquisition of BellSouth. BellSouth Corporate headquarters was located in the Campanile building, also in Midtown. By 2020, AT&amp;T had vacated its offices.

==Background==
The company, then called Southern Bell, originally planned to build the parking deck for the tower one block further east at the corner of Ponce de Leon Avenue and Peachtree Street. This would have required the razing of the historic Fox Theatre which would have been an especially great loss to the city after the downtown Loew&#x27;s Grand Theatre was destroyed by fire in 1978. Tremendous opposition, protests, fundraising, and petition drives within the community prevented the Fox&#x27;s demolition. Even Liberace spoke out on behalf of the &quot;Fabulous Fox&quot;. In the end, a complicated deal was struck to build the parking deck on an alternate site north of the main tower on West Peachtree Street.

The building has a direct entrance to the North Avenue MARTA Station, which is located at the southern end of the complex and was built concurrently with the building. In 2002, BellSouth completed construction of two additional mid-rise buildings adjacent to the tower to form its BellSouth Midtown Center campus as part of its effort to consolidate office space around mass transit stations.

The architects who designed the tower were Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and Rosser International, Inc. The general contractor for its construction was Beers Skanska, Inc. The building also served as a filming location for the 1993 science fiction action film RoboCop 3, in which it was used as the setting for the headquarters of the evil megacorporation O.C.P, the main antagonist organization in the RoboCop trilogy.

In 2019, a major renovation and re-branding to &quot;Tower Square&quot; was announced. It was subsequently renamed in October 2020.

<text>Linum (flax) is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae. They are native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. The genus includes the common flax (&quot;L. usitatissimum&quot;), the bast fibre of which is used to produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.

The flowers of most species are blue or yellow, rarely red, white, or pink, and some are heterostylous. There is an average of 6 to 10 seeds per boll.

&quot;Linum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the cabbage moth, the nutmeg, the setaceous Hebrew character and &quot;Coleophora striolatella&quot;, which feeds exclusively on &quot;Linum narbonense&quot;.

== Cultivation ==
Several flaxes are cultivated as garden ornamentals, including the blue-flowered species blue flax (&quot;L. narbonense&quot;), Lewis&#x27; blue flax (&quot;L. lewisii&quot;), and perennial blue flax (&quot;L. perenne&quot;), the red-flowered scarlet flax (&quot;L. grandiflorum&quot;), and the yellow-flowered golden flax (&quot;L. flavum&quot;). In Eurasia, since Roman times, the genus &quot;Linum&quot; has been cultivated not only for its plant fiber, but also its seeds and tender leaves for culinary usage.

<text>Four Seasons Hotels Limited, trading as Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, is a Canadian luxury hotel and resort company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Four Seasons currently operates more than 100 hotels and resorts worldwide. Since 2007, Bill Gates (through Cascade Investment) and Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal (through Kingdom Holding Company) have been majority owners of the company. As of January 2022, Cascade Investment owns 71.25% and Kingdom Holding Company owns 23.75% of the hotel and resort company.

==History==


Canadian businessman Isadore Sharp founded Four Seasons in 1960. While a young architect working for his father, Sharp designed a motel for a family friend; its success motivated him to try creating his own hotel. He bought a large parcel of land in a run-down area of Toronto and planned a stopover for business travelers; the Four Seasons Motor Hotel opened in 1961 with initial investors, Murray Koffler, Fred Eisen, and Eddie Creed.

Four Seasons built more hotels, including the 1963 Inn on the Park, a $4 million two-story resort hotel in suburban Toronto that housed Canada&#x27;s first discothèque.

Upscale luxury became part of the brand when the company expanded to London. When a developer approached Four Seasons about building a hotel in London, Sharp planned it to compete with the city&#x27;s old-world, elite hotels, such as Claridge&#x27;s and The Connaught. The Inn on the Park hotel in London opened in 1970.

The lead consultant was the architecture firm Aedas.

In 1974, cost overruns at the Four Seasons Hotel Vancouver nearly led the company into bankruptcy. As a result, the company began shifting to its current, management-only business model, eliminating costs associated with buying land and buildings. The company went public in 1986. In the 1990s, Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton began direct competition, with Ritz-Carlton emphasizing a uniform look while Four Seasons emphasized local architecture and styles with uniform service; in the end Four Seasons gained market share.

Built in 1986, Four Seasons Hotel Austin is a nine-story hotel on of land on the Lady Bird Lake&#x27;s north shore. In 1997, Four Seasons Hotel Austin became the first hotel to have &quot;a high-speed wireless Internet network&quot; after Wayport, Inc. set it up there for testing wireless Internet networks. The hotel hosted Queen Elizabeth II in 1991 when she visited Texas. It was acquired by Anbang Insurance Group from the Blackstone Group for $359.7 million in 2016.

In 1992, Four Seasons acquired Regent Hotels &amp; Resorts. Most Regent hotels in the pipeline at the time, such as those in Bali and Istanbul, opened as Four Seasons, while the existing portfolio, such as the Beverly Wilshire, were allowed to temporarily retain the Regent brand until they met brand standards to become Four Seasons properties. Carlson acquired the rights to develop new hotels under the Regent brand in 1998, and by the mid-2000s, most of the older Regent properties had rebranded into Four Seasons, with the notable exception of Regent Singapore. In the wake of Regent&#x27;s purchase by IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts in 2018, Four Seasons announced that it would cease its management of Regent Singapore, therefore ending the company&#x27;s 26-year-long association with the name.

Economic downturns in the early and mid-2000s affected the company. When the September 11 attacks caused the collapse of the travel industry, Four Seasons refused to cut room prices in order to preserve the perceived value of the brand, which caused tension with property owners who were losing money. The company recovered, and in 2007 it agreed to a buyout by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia for $3.8 billion. The pair own 95 percent of the company, and Sharp owns the remainder.

During the Great Recession, the company made the first corporate layoffs in its history, cutting 10% of its Toronto workforce. In April 2010, after a year-long dispute with Broadreach Capital Partners and Maritz, Wolff &amp; Co., owners of the Aviara resort near San Diego, an arbitration panel ruled that, while both parties contributed to the demise of the business relationship, Four Seasons had not violated its management agreement. The arbitrators ordered Broadreach to pay Four Seasons to terminate the contract.&quot; The resort is no longer a Four Seasons.

Four Seasons has continued to add more hotels and resorts to its portfolio, notably in China. It opened a new hotel in Hangzhou in 2010 and Guangzhou, Beijing, and a second property in Shanghai in 2012. In India, it has two hotels — one in Mumbai and other one in Bangalore. In 2013, it opened its first hotel in Russia in the Lobanov-Rostovsky Palace in St. Petersburg, and later opened a second hotel in Moscow. In Indonesia, it has one hotel in Jakarta and another two in Bali. In October 2012, Four Seasons opened a new 259-room Toronto hotel in Yorkville, designed by internationally known design firm Yabu Pushelberg. The hotel includes an upscale restaurant led by celebrity chef Daniel Boulud. It was hailed by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as &quot;the renewal of an iconic Canadian brand in its hometown&quot;. The penthouse was bought by entrepreneur Robert Österlund (founder of Xacti, LLC and Inbox.com) for a Canadian record price of over $28 million.

In 2009, founder Sharp wrote a memoir titled &quot;Four Seasons: The Story of Business Philosophy&quot;. It contained a historical chronicle of the hotels since its inception.

In September 2021, Cascade announced it will increase its existing 47.5% stake to 71.25% by purchasing, for $2.21 billion in cash, half of the existing 47.5% stake owned by the Saudi Kingdom Holding Company (KHC).

==Business model==
Four Seasons does not own any of its properties; it operates them on behalf of real estate owners and developers. For example, its Las Vegas hotel is part of the Mandalay Bay complex. The contracts between Four Seasons and property owners typically permit the company to participate in the design of the property and run it with nearly total control over every aspect of the operation.

Four Seasons generally earns three percent of the gross income and about five percent of profits from the properties it operates. Property owners are required to additionally contribute money for marketing, chain-wide sales, reservations systems and renovations. Four Seasons hotels have larger staffs than competing chains, and the company maintains separate reserve accounts for each hotel to cover upkeep costs. Profit margins are relatively low, but the brand attracts developers through the hotels&#x27; reputation as solid assets for loan collateral or resale.

==Residential rentals==
 Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts began offering vacation rentals in June 2014. Titled Residential Rentals, the properties are available in: North America (Costa Rica, Houston, Jackson Hole, Nevis, Punta Mita, San Diego, Whistler, Vail). Africa (Marrakech, Mauritius, Seychelles, Sharm El Sheikh), Europe (Cap-Ferrat) and Asia (Bali at Jimbaran Bay, Jakarta, Chiang Mai, Koh Samui, Bangkok). The first stand alone Four Seasons Private Residences opened in London at 20 Grosvenor Square, Mayfair in July 2019. It will be the third Four Seasons venue in London.

Residential Rentals provide the same services as Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts in a residential setting. Customers are mainly multi-generational vacationers and small group travellers.

* Four Seasons Hotel Vancouver, Canada: Opened in 1976, it was one of the few Four Seasons hotel directly owned by the chain, as opposed to being operated on behalf of a third-party. After 44 years in service, the hotel closed in 2020 following a legal dispute with its landowners.

* Regent Singapore, a Four Seasons Hotel: Opened in 1988 as the Pavilion Inter-Continental Singapore, converted to Regent and taken over by Four Seasons from 1992 to 2018, making it the last Regent property under Four Seasons to retain its name. The hotel is currently managed by Hilton Worldwide as Conrad Singapore Orchard.
* The Ritz-Carlton Chicago, a Four Seasons Hotel, United States: Opened in 1975, the hotel joined the Four Seasons chain in 1977. Despite its name, it was not originally affiliated with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company (which did not exist at the time; the name &quot;Ritz-Carlton&quot; was carried under a license). It left the chain in 2013 before joining Marriott International in 2015, under which it began operating as a proper Ritz-Carlton.

== Ships ==
In 2003, Four Seasons Explorer, a luxury three-deck catamaran with 11 rooms, began to sail in the Maldives. Visitors from the Maldives&#x27; two Four Seasons resorts, Kuda Huraa and Landaa Giraavaru, could either book rooms or charter the entire ship for trips that lasted from three to seven days. After two decades, the ship left the Maldives in 2023 for Palau, where Four Seasons began offering tours at the end of that year.

In September 2022, the Four Seasons announced it was launching Four Seasons Yachts. In June 2023, the company confirmed plans for a second ship due for delivery in 2026.

The first ultra luxury super yacht &quot;Four Seasons I&quot; was floated in Fincantieri Shipyard, Italy in January, 2025. The cruise has 95 ultra luxury suites with large balconies and floor-to-ceiling ocean views. It is scheduled to enter service in January, 2026.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; magazine and Zagat Survey rank the hotel chain&#x27;s properties among the top luxury hotels worldwide. Readers of &quot;Conde Nast Traveler&quot; magazine have voted Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle in Chiang Rai, Thailand as among the top ten hotels in the world for three consecutive years. The company has been named one of the &quot;100 Best Companies to Work For&quot; by &quot;Fortune&quot; every year since the survey&#x27;s inception in 1998, ranking No. 47 in 2015, and is lauded for having one of the lowest employee turnover rates in the hospitality industry.

In recent years, restaurants at Four Seasons hotels and resorts have been recognized by Zagat and Michelin. The latter has awarded a total of 29 stars to 20 of the company&#x27;s restaurants, including Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong (three restaurants), Paris (three restaurants), Beijing (two restaurants) and Florence.

<text>Larrea is a genus of flowering plants in the caltrop family, Zygophyllaceae. It contains five species of evergreen shrubs that are native to the Americas. The generic name honours Bishop Juan Antonio Hernández Pérez de Larrea, a patron of science. South American members of this genus are known as jarillas and can produce fertile interspecific hybrids. One of the more notable species is the creosote bush (&quot;L. tridentata&quot;) of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The King Clone ring in the Mojave Desert is a creosote bush clonal colony estimated to be about 11,700 years old.

==Species==
*&quot;Larrea ameghinoi&quot;
*&quot;Larrea cuneifolia&quot;
*&quot;Larrea divaricata&quot; 
*&quot;Larrea nitida&quot;

<doc id="338574" wikidata="Q156099" url="?curid=338574" title="Dianthus">
<text>Dianthus ( ) is a genus of about 340 species of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, native mainly to Europe and Asia, with a few species in north Africa and in southern Africa, and one species (&quot;D. repens&quot;) in arctic North America. Common names include carnation (&quot;D. caryophyllus&quot;), pink (&quot;D. plumarius&quot; and related species) and sweet william (&quot;D. barbatus&quot;).

== Description ==
The species are mostly herbaceous perennials, a few are annual or biennial, and some are low subshrubs with woody basal stems. The leaves are opposite, simple, mostly linear and often strongly glaucous grey green to blue green. The flowers have five petals, typically with a frilled or pinked margin, and are (in almost all species) pale to dark pink. One species, &quot;D.&quot; &quot;knappii&quot;, has yellow flowers with a purple centre. Some species, particularly the perennial pinks, are noted for their strong spicy fragrance.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Species ===
Selected species include:
Hybrids include;
* &#x27;Devon Xera&#x27; – Fire Star Dianthus
* &#x27;John Prichard&#x27;

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Dianthus&quot; is from the Greek διόσανθος, a compound from the words Δῖος &quot;Dios&quot; (&quot;of Zeus&quot;) and ἄνθος &quot;anthos&quot; (&quot;flower&quot;), and was cited by the Greek botanist Theophrastus. The colour pink may be named after the flower, coming from the frilled edge of the flowers: the verb &quot;to pink&quot; dates from the 14th century and means &quot;to decorate with a perforated or punched pattern&quot;. As is also demonstrated by the name of &quot;pinking shears&quot;, special scissors for cloth that create a zigzag or decorative edge that discourages fraying. Alternatively, &quot;pink&quot; may be derived from the Dutch &quot;pinksteren&quot; alluding to the season of flowering; &quot;pinksteren&quot; meaning &quot;Pentecost&quot; in Dutch. Thus the colour may be named after the flower, rather than the flower after the colour.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Dianthus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including cabbage moth, double-striped pug, large yellow underwing and the lychnis. Also three species of &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers feed exclusively on &quot;Dianthus&quot;; &quot;C.&quot; &quot;dianthi&quot;, &quot;C.&quot; &quot;dianthivora&quot; and &quot;C.&quot; &quot;musculella&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;D.&quot; &quot;superbus&quot;).

== Cultivation ==
Since 1717, dianthus species have been extensively bred and hybridised to produce many thousands of cultivars for garden use and floristry, in all shades of white, pink, yellow and red, with a huge variety of flower shapes and markings. They are often divided into the following main groups:

* Border carnations – fully hardy, growing to , large blooms
* Perpetual flowering carnations – grown under glass, flowering throughout the year, often used for exhibition purposes, growing to 
* Malmaison carnations – derived from the variety &#x27;Souvenir de la Malmaison&#x27;, growing to , grown for their intense &quot;clove&quot; fragrance
* Old-fashioned pinks – older varieties; evergreen perennials forming mounds of blue-green foliage with masses of flowers in summer, growing to 
* Modern pinks – newer varieties, growing to , often blooming two or three times per year
* Alpine pinks – mat-forming perennials, suitable for the rockery or alpine garden, growing to 

Over 100 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Culture ==
In the language of flowers, pink &quot;Dianthus&quot; symbolize boldness.

&quot;Dianthus gratianopolitanus&quot; – the Cheddar pink – was chosen as the county flower of Somerset in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife. &quot;Dianthus japonicus&quot; is the official flower of Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, Japan.

In Japan, &quot;Dianthus superbus&quot; – the fringed pink or nadeshiko – is used in the term Yamato nadeshiko to describe the archetype of a traditional ideal woman.

<doc id="338579" wikidata="Q2504435" url="?curid=338579" title="Farm-to-market road">
<text>In the United States, a farm-to-market road or ranch-to-market road (sometimes farm road or ranch road for short) is a state highway or county road that connects rural or agricultural areas to market towns. These are better-quality roads, usually a highway, that farmers and ranchers use to transport products to market towns or distribution centers. Historically used throughout the country, today the term is primarily associated with a large state-maintained highway system in Texas.

==History==
By 1930, counties and townships across the U.S. had built a large number of farm-to-market roads, many of which were in need of repairs and safety improvements. The Chief of the Bureau of Public Roads, Thomas Harris MacDonald, considered this need to be driven not by insufficient funding but by inefficient planning and inadequate equipment on the part of thousands of counties. He advocated for an expansion of state-maintained highway systems through the federal-aid highway program, so that counties could focus on maintaining fewer roads to a higher level of service.

==Texas==
This term is most closely associated with Texas, where Farm to Market Road and Ranch to Market Road indicate roadways that are part of the state&#x27;s system of secondary and connecting routes, built and maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Texas established this system in 1949 to improve access to rural areas. As with other state-maintained highways in Texas, all Farm or Ranch to Market roads are paved. The system consists primarily of two-lane roads, although some segments have an additional number of lanes, while some have been upgraded to freeways. Farm to Markets may also run alongside large urban freeways and tollways (for example, FM 1093, which runs west out of Houston to the Katy-Fulshear area alongside Westpark Tollway). Speed limits along these roads vary, but may be as high as in rural areas, such as in Andrews and Pecos counties (for example, along FM 1788, FM 1776, and FM 1053). 

===History===
The first farm-to-market road in Texas was completed in January 1937 during the Great Depression. It connected Mount Enterprise and the former community of Shiloh in Rusk County. The route was long and was constructed at a cost of $48,015.12 (). This route is now part of Texas State Highway 315.

The first officially designated highway, FM 1, was authorized in Sabine County, Texas in 1941 to connect US 96 near Pineland to a sawmill belonging to the Temple Lumber Company at Magasco. The first Ranch to Market Road was designated in 1942.

In 1945, the highway commission authorized a three-year pilot program for the construction of of farm-to-market roadways, with cost to be shared equally by the state and federal governments. As the program grew, efforts were made by legislators from rural areas, including State Senator Grady Hazlewood of Amarillo, to expand the farm-to-market road network in the late 1940s. The funding was to have come from an increase in the fuel tax, as proposed by State Senator Grover Morris in 1947. Although polls suggested that a majority of Texas residents were in favor of such a tax, this measure was stymied by lobbyists, who supported such funding for arterial roads.

The popularity of the program and the perceived need to connect the vast, isolated central and western areas of the state prompted the passing of the Colson-Briscoe Act in 1949, sponsored by State Senator E. Neveille Colson and State Representative Dolph Briscoe. This legislation appropriated funding for the creation of an extensive system of secondary roads to provide access to the rural areas of the state and to allow farmers and ranchers to bring their goods to market, reserving a flat $15million per year (equivalent to $ in ) plus 1 cent () per gallon of gasoline sold in the state for local highway construction.

By 1957, the system had grown to over . In 1962, the Texas legislature adjusted the appropriated funding amount to $23million annually (equivalent to $ in ), through federal fund matching, and expanded the farm-to-market system from . By 1964, the system&#x27;s mileage exceeded that of all other federal and state routes combined. The system now accounts for over half of the mileage maintained by TxDOT.

===Identification===
Signs designating a Farm to Market or Ranch to Market road are a black square background containing a white shape of the state of Texas, with the words &quot;FARM ROAD&quot; or &quot;RANCH ROAD&quot; appearing in white text on the background and the route number in black text within the shape of Texas. Guide signs (the large green signs usually found along highways in the United States) designating these roads use a simple white rectangle with the abbreviation &quot;F.M.&quot; or &quot;R.M.&quot; and the route number appearing below the abbreviation in black text.

As a result of population growth and the expansion of urban areas, many Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads that originally served rural areas now serve urban areas, sometimes exclusively. An effort was made to rename such roads &quot;Urban Roads&quot; on June 27, 1995, but residents opposed the effort, arguing that removing the &quot;Farm&quot; and &quot;Ranch&quot; from the designations was &quot;un-Texan,&quot; and that the cost of changing signage was not justified. Other than a few route markers, such as on FM 1315 near Victoria, most signs were not changed, and TxDOT abandoned the idea to do so. While the Farm to Market and Ranch to Market route markers remained in use, the state tracked these Urban Roads separately in its highway designation files. For example, the mileage of FM 544 in the Plano area was transferred from FM 544 to UR 544 in 1995. As part of the state highway system, Urban Roads were eligible for state maintenance; however, unlike rural Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads, they did not receive state funding for expansion. On November 15, 2018, the Urban Road system was cancelled, and all roads on this system reverted back to their previous FM and RM designations. For example, UR 544 was redesignated as FM 544.

Farm to Market and Ranch to Market roads are numbered as a single set of roads; thus, there is not an FM and an RM route with the same number. Urban Roads were designated with the same route numbers as the FM or RM routes from which the mileage was transferred.

Ranch Road 1, which runs near the former ranch home of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, is signed with a Ranch to Market Road route marker, but it is not part of this system; rather, it is the only roadway that TxDOT has designated as a &quot;Ranch Road&quot;.

===Business routes===

Texas currently has two signed business routes of Farm to Market Roads: Business RM 1431 in Burnet County and Business FM 1960 in Harris County. Both business routes are former alignments that have been bypassed by newer routings. A third business route, Business FM 1187 in Tarrant County, was designated from 2004 to 2016.

== Other states ==
Missouri has a similar state-operated system of farm-to-market roads, called Missouri supplemental routes. Missouri uses single (e.g., &quot;O&quot;, &quot;V&quot;) and double letters (e.g., &quot;NN&quot;, &quot;AC&quot;).

Iowa also has a farm-to-market road system. Those roads are under county jurisdiction, but are eligible for state aid from a dedicated fund.

Louisiana has a farm-to-market road system. The 1955 renumbering renumbered all routes based on an A-B-C system of route classification: A is primary, B secondary, and C farm-to-market. All routes 300 through 1266 are classified C routes.

Ohio&#x27;s farm-to-market roads were maintained by the state Department of Highways but built to only a county road standard. In 1939, the state spent $ (equivalent to $ in ) to improve of farm-to-market roads. In 1940, the department launched a farm-to-market road improvement program alongside the usual maintenance program; it improved of roadway at a cost of $, including funds from the Works Progress Administration.

<doc id="338589" wikidata="Q6658332" url="?curid=338589" title="Liverpool Castle">
<text>Liverpool Castle was a castle in Liverpool, England, that stood from the early 13th century to the early 18th century (1237–1726).

==Construction==
The castle was probably erected in the 1230s, between 1232 and 1235, under the orders of William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby. No records of the castle construction survive, except the licence to fortify de Ferrers received in 1235. Nearby in West Derby, there had long been a castle, which was taken by the Ferrers family in 1232, but by 1296 it lay in ruins. The castle in Liverpool was built to protect King John&#x27;s new port, (King John had died in 1216) and was sited at the top of modern-day Lord Street, the highest point in the city which overlooks the Pool. This corresponds to present day Derby Square (Queen Victoria Monument), near the city centre.

==Description==
The castle was built on top of a plateau, which had been specially constructed, and a moat measuring 20 yards (18 m) was cut out of solid rock. The main building of the castle consisted of the gatehouse flanked by two towers at the north-east corner which faced Castle Street; three round towers at the three remaining corners, one being added at a later date than the others, in 1442. Four curtain walls connected the four towers; the northern and southern walls were recessed to allow them to be commanded from the towers. Inside the castle were a hall and chapel, which were connected to the south-western tower, and a brewhouse and bakehouse. There was also a passage which ran under the moat toward the edge of the river. The courtyard was divided by a wall built running from the north wall to the south wall. Underneath the castle walls stood a dovecot, and an orchard ran from the castle to the Pool in the east.

==History==

Upon the death of William de Ferrers in 1247, his son William inherited both Liverpool Castle and West Derby Castle. The heir to the title was Robert de Ferrers. He rebelled against King Henry III and was arrested and held in the Tower of London and then Windsor Castle. His lands and title were removed and taken back by the Crown. Henry III presented the land, along with Lancaster to his second son Edmund. Mary de Ferrers, wife of the forfeited earl and niece to the King, was ordered to surrender the castle in July 1266. The lands were then held by Edmund and passed onto his successor Thomas.

It was under the administration of Thomas that Liverpool progressed steadily. The earl did not bestow much worth on the borough of Liverpool and in 1315, he granted the castle and the land to Robert de Holland. The creation of the patronage of Robert de Holland caused some unrest among other landowners, and on 25 October in the same year Adam Banastre, Henry de Lea and William de Bradshagh &quot;(Bradshaw)&quot; banded together (the Banastre Rebellion) and launched an attack on the castle, and were defeated within an hour. This is the only recorded attack on the castle to happen before the English Civil War. Between 1315 and 1323, the borough of Liverpool returned to the hands of the Crown. In 1323, King Edward II visited the town and lodged at the castle from 24 to 30 October. Early in the reign of Edward III, the king utilised Liverpool as a port of embarkation in his wars with Scotland and Ireland. In 1327, Edward ordered the constable of the castle to give shelter to men fleeing from the Scots. There was an inquisition into the land at Lancaster in 1367 that stated &quot;there is at Liverpull a certain Castle, the foss whereof and the herbage are worth by the year 2s., and there is a dovehouse under the Castle which is worth by the year 6s.8d.&quot;

Sir Richard Molyneux was appointed constable of the castle in 1440, and the title was made hereditary five years later. In 1442, the castle was strengthened by the addition of a fourth tower in the south-east corner to the cost of £46 13s 10¼d. On 2 October 1559 the castle is stated as being &quot;in utter ruin and decay&quot;. The Great Tower had a slate roof and it was suggested to be used as storage for the court rolls. It was decided that the castle would undergo repairs costing around £150, &quot;otherwaies it were a grate defacement unto the said towne of Litherpole&quot;.

During the reign of Charles I the castle was seized by Lord Derby. In 1644, Prince Rupert and his men took the castle, which was later taken back by Sir John Moore. Protestant supporters of William of Orange seized the castle in 1689. On 5 March 1704, the burgesses obtained a lease for the castle and its site from the Crown for fifty years. William Molyneux, 4th Viscount Molyneux, disputed this as he still claimed hereditary constableship. This delayed the settlement of the lease until 1726, when the last remaining ruins of the castle were removed. In 1707/08 a Mr. Serocold a London surveyor planning the wet dock suggested the castle&#x27;s stone would save money by reusing it to build the dock, it is possible this plan went ahead. Finally, in 1715, an act of Parliament (1 Geo. 1. St. 2. c. &quot;21&quot;) was passed to demolish the castle and build a church in its place. Construction of St George&#x27;s church began on the site of the old castle and the church was consecrated in 1734. By 1825, the church had been pulled down and a new one built in its place. In 1899, the church was demolished and the Victoria Monument was erected in 1902. In 1976 excavation of the south side of Castle Street was conducted before the construction of the Crown Courts building, which was built in the style of a castle.

==Replica==

At Lever Park in Rivington (near Chorley), Sir William Lever built a scale replica of Liverpool Castle, a folly known as Rivington Castle. Building started in 1912. The replica, which was not completed, was based on a conjectural reconstruction of the castle prepared by E. W. Cox in 1892.

<text>M.E.Ch.A. (Spanish: Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán; &quot;Chicano Student Movement of Aztlán&quot;) is a US-based organization that seeks to promote Chicano unity and empowerment through political action. 

==Origins in the 1960s==
MEChA began during the 1960s, empowered through the political movements of the time, especially the civil rights and Chicano Movement. The group coalesced out of several organizations which had formed during that turbulent decade. In 1969, students from twelve universities met at a conference in Santa Barbara, California, and called for a unification of all student and youth organizations into one organization, MEChA. The Denver, Colorado–based Crusade for Justice, a civil rights and educational organization founded in the mid-1960s, concerned itself with the problems of the city&#x27;s Chicano youth. One of the founding documents, &quot;El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán&quot;, was drafted during this conference. This document reflects the sentiment of the Latino/Chicano youth during an era of a turbulent social climate (especially in the wake of violence experienced by Latino youth from the US military and police during the Zoot Suit Riots).

The Mexican American Youth Organization was founded in San Antonio, Texas in 1967. It employed the tactics of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and later spurred the creation of the La Raza Unida Party.

The Brown Berets were a youth organization that agitated against police brutality in East Los Angeles. In 1968, they helped the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), Sal Castro, and other youth who met at the Piranya Cafe organize the East L.A. walkouts, called the Blowouts, a series of protests against unfair conditions in Los Angeles schools.

Following the Blowouts, a group of students, school administrators, and teachers formed the Chicano Coordinating Committee on Higher Education (CCCHE), a network to pressure the adoption and expansion of equal opportunity programs in California&#x27;s colleges.
Rene Nuñez, an activist from San Diego who participated in the 1968 walkouts, conceived a conference to unify the student groups under the auspices of the CCCHE. This conference led to the founding of MEChA along with a basic Chicano Studies curriculum plan called “El Plan”. 

In April 1969, Chicano college students held a nationwide conference at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Many of the attendees were present at the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference hosted by Rodolfo &quot;Corky&quot; Gonzales&#x27; Crusade for Justice a month prior, and the Santa Barbara conference represented the extension of the Chicano Youth Movement into the realm of higher education.

The name &quot;Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán&quot; was already in use by a few groups, and the name was adopted by the conference attendees because of the importance of each of the words and as a means of transcending the regional nature of the multiple campus-based groups. Conference attendees also set the national agenda and drafted the Plan de Santa Bárbara, a pedagogic manifesto.

MEChA chapters first took root on California college campuses and then expanded to high schools and schools in other states.

==Organizational structure==
===Affiliated chapters===
MEChA exists as over 400 loosely affiliated chapters within a national organization. Typical activities of a MEChA chapters include educational &amp; social activities, such as academic tutoring, mentorship, folklore and poetry recitals, exploring the way of life through an indigenous perspective bringing Chicano speakers to their campus, high school outreach, attending Statewide, Regional, &amp; National Conferences. Many chapters are also involved in political actions, such as lobbying high school and university administrators for expanded Bilingual Education programs and Chicano-related curricula, the celebration of Mexican cultural traditions, as well as other Latin American holidays (such as Mexican Independence Day), Columbus Day protests, sit-ins, hunger strikes, boycotts, rallies, marches and other political activism relating to civil rights, affirmative action, and immigration.

===National MEChA Constitution===
The National MEChA constitution was ratified on April 9, 1995 during the second annual National MEChA conference at the University of California, Berkeley (Cal). The document outlines four objectives:

* Educational, cultural, economical, political, and social empowerment of Chicanos.
* Retention of Chicano identity and furthering of cultural awareness.
* Uplifting and mobilizing Chicanos and Chicanas through higher education.
* Implementing plans of action concerning Chicanos and Chicanas.

Since its adoption, the document has been amended five times:
* Amended on April 14, 1996 at University of Texas, Pan American
* Amended on April 14, 1997 at Michigan State University (MSU)
* Amended on March 18, 2001 at San Diego State University (SDSU)
* Amended on March 30, 2003 at University of California, Berkeley
* Amended on May 30, 2010 at University of Washington, Seattle

During the 1999 National Conference at Phoenix College, MEChA adopted a document entitled &quot;The Philosophy of MEChA&quot; which affirmed the more moderate view that &quot;all people are potential Chicanas and Chicanos&quot;, and that &quot;Chicano identity is not a nationality but a philosophy&quot;. In addition, &quot;The Philosophy of MEChA&quot; addressed the problem of outside organizations co-opting the legitimacy of MEChA to advance their own agendas, doing so by establishing guidelines to make local MEChA chapters more accountable to the national organization.

== Geography ==
In 1969, MEChA was founded in Santa Barbara, California where Chicanos adopted &quot;El Plan de Santa Barbara.&quot; The manifesto provided a strategy to establish Chicano Studies Departments within colleges and universities. By consolidating students&#x27; political power, MEChA became a significant on-campus political force and the name signified a position to challenge social injustices and to reject assimilation through radical activism on-campus and in the community.
While the student-led organization formed in California, MEChA became a national organization with chapters in junior middle schools, high schools, community colleges, and universities. Yet MEChA&#x27;s geographic expansion was rather uneven. From 1969 to 1971, MEChA grew rapidly in California with major centers of activism on campuses in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Diego, and the Riverside-San Bernardino area. Other early chapters were also established in Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, and Indiana. In these years, new chapters were founded at universities and colleges exclusively. The activist Maria Luisa Alanis Ruiz joined the Oregon chapter while a student as part of her life as both an activist and academic in chicana feminism.

By the early 1970s, a few MEChA chapters were founded in the East but mainly at Ivy League schools such as Harvard, Yale, and Brown University. MEChA largely remained a West coast organization. Expanding further in the 1980s, MEChA chapters began to appear in community colleges and high schools, but again predominantly in California and especially Southern California.

The organization did not catch on in Texas. A Mexican American Student Organization (MASO) was active at the University of Texas from 1967 until at least 1972 and students at St. Mary&#x27;s College in San Antonio joined MAYO but there are no signs of MEChA chapters or other student groups in Texas until the mid-1980s.

As for Florida and other southern states, There are found no information about any chapters in this part of the country despite the growing Mexican American presence on campuses and in the region&#x27;s cities. But if MEChA&#x27;s geography was limited, its ability to survive and expand in California and other western states was remarkable. Student organizations rarely last very long. But MEChA has expanded each decade.

During the 1990s, MEChA experienced a decade of slow growth yet in the 2000s the organization saw an incredible upsurge of new chapters. High schools students led the charge predominantly within California and likely attributed to the anti-immigration (H.R. 4437) legislation proposed in the mid-2000s. Much like when MEChA was established, student mobilization has propelled and maintained the organization relevant for nearly fifty years.

MEChA was one of the many organizations and groups that sponsored the Cinco de Mayo movement, the others included the Chicano student groups that were on campus and the community. The Cinco de Mayo movement was one of many big cultural events.

==Criticism==
In 2008, a passage from MEChA&#x27;s national website read: &#x27;As Chicanas and Chicanos of Aztlán, we are a nationalist movement of Indigenous Gente that lay claim to the land that is ours by birthright. As a nationalist movement we seek to free our people from the exploitation of an oppressive society that occupies our land. Thus, the principle of nationalism serves to preserve the cultural traditions of La Familia de La Raza and promotes our identity as a Chicana/Chicano Gente.&#x27; Such statements have led MEChA to be criticized by right-wing sources, including the &quot;National Review&quot; and Michelle Malkin which alleges that MEChA is tinged with racist and separatist views. The Times Online has referred to MEChA as &quot;a radical Mexican student organisation&quot; in describing the associations of 2003 California gubernatorial candidate Cruz Bustamante.

Critics also point out the group&#x27;s use of the word Aztlán: To many, this word calls to mind a once real region comprising much of the Southwestern United States and as a result, some critics feel use of the phrase implies support for the controversial theory of reconquista. While MEChA supporters point out that the Aztlan mythology itself does not refer to reclaiming conquered lands, it simply describes the home of the Aztec people.

Critics of MECha regard the phrase &quot;Por La Raza todo, Fuera de La Raza nada&quot; as ethnocentric and racist. This phrase appears in El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán as the official &quot;slogan&quot; of MEChA. MEChA members themselves differ in their interpretations of &quot;La Raza&quot;. While some use the term to strictly refer to only mestizos and Chicanos, others use it to mean all Hispanics and minorities. A possible origin of the phrase is the Cuban Revolution, which used the similar slogan &quot;Por la revolución todo, fuera de la revolución nada!&quot; According to the official MEChA website, the organization &quot;does not exclude membership based on socio-economic status, gender, race, or orientation.&quot;

A 1998 MEChA youth conference at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly SLO) featured a printed program that introduced the school as &quot;Cal Poly State Jewniversity&quot;. The program also referred to New York as &quot;Jew York&quot;. When the Anti-Defamation League objected to the program, the Cal Poly MEChA organization issued a formal apology, a repudiation of the anti-Semitism and expelled those students who had been responsible for the production of the printed conference program.

The National Council of La Raza has distanced itself from MEChA due to controversial allegations made by some of its members. In a public press release, NCLR declared, &quot;NCLR freely acknowledges that some of the organization&#x27;s founding documents, e.g., Plan Espiritual de Aztlán, contain inappropriate rhetoric, and NCLR also acknowledges that rhetoric from some MEChA members has been extremist and inflammatory... NCLR has publicly and repeatedly disavowed this rhetoric&quot;. However, the NCLR emphasized that MEChA&#x27;s mission statement is to support Latino students at institutions of higher education. In reference to the rhetoric included in the Plan Espiritual de Aztlán, the NCLR quoted journalist Gustavo Arellano who commented in a Los Angeles Times op-ed article,&quot;few members take these dated relics of the 1960s seriously, if they even bothered to read them.&quot; Within the article, Arellano also noted that all of the MEChA members of his class graduated from college and have gone on to successful careers, a rarity at a time when only 12% of Latinos have a college degree.

==Controversies==
*In May 1995, &quot;Voz Fronteriza&quot;, a publication of the MEChA chapter at the University of California, San Diego published an editorial entitled &quot;Death of a Migra Pig,&quot; which celebrated the recent death of Luis A. Santiago, a Latino Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer who died in the line of duty. The editorial stated that Santiago was a &quot;traitor...to his race,&quot; and that &quot;We&#x27;re glad this pig died, he deserved to die,&quot; and argued, &quot;All the Migra pigs should be killed, every single one...the only good one is a dead one...The time to fight back is now. It is time to organize an anti-Migra patrol...It is to [sic] bad that more Migra pigs didn&#x27;t die with him.&quot; The article generated public outrage, and Congressman Duncan L. Hunter threatened to pursue legislation that would eliminate federal funding for UCSD. UCSD defended the paper&#x27;s right to publish the editorial, arguing that it was protected by Freedom of Speech.
*On May 11, 1993, Chicano students at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) caused damage to the Faculty Center estimated between $35,000 to $50,000 during a riot which ensued following the university administration&#x27;s rejection of the creation of a Chicano Studies program, an announcement that was made on the eve of César Chávez&#x27;s funeral. Following this incident, MEChA students organized peaceful demonstrations at UCLA, including a 14-day hunger strike which garnered support from several California state leaders and ultimately resulted in the establishment of The César Chávez Center.
*In February 2002, MEChA members were accused of theft of an entire press run of a particular issue of the UC Berkeley conservative newspaper &quot;California Patriot&quot; which was featuring an article that labelled MEChA a &quot;neo-Nazi&quot;-like organization. Police reported that over 3,000 copies (valued at $1,500 - $2,000) were stolen during a break-in at the Patriot office in Eshleman Hall. The issue of the paper included an article, entitled &quot;MEChA: Student Funded Bigotry and Hate,&quot; blames the group for impeding &quot;advances in civil rights toward a colorblind American society&quot; through &quot;anti-American hate&quot; and &quot;a mentality that leads its adherents to believe anyone who is white and male is to blame for any historical injustice.&quot; The article written by the &quot;California Patriot&quot; staff, which Time magazine described as reveling in their roles as provocateurs, included controversial remarks made by a separate organization that were falsely attributed to MEChA. MEChA denied any involvement in the incidents and &quot;condemns harassment,&quot; said Livia Rojas, a leader in the group. The case was ultimately dropped as insufficient evidence was found to implicate any suspects.
*On May 18, 2006, nearly 2,000 copies (of a total run of 5,000 copies) of &quot;The Courier&quot; were removed from newspaper boxes on the Pasadena, California, campus, torn in half and returned to the paper&#x27;s campus office with a signed note claiming responsibility. The letter expressed disappointment for the lack of coverage provided for a MEChA-hosted event on May 12, 2006, which had involved &quot;months of hard work&quot;. It ended stating: &quot;As students of P.C.C., we can not accept this issue of the Campus Courier.&quot; However, student leaders of MEChA on campus maintained that the group as a whole was not responsible for the incident. A subsequent investigation determined that the theft had been committed by an individual MEChA member who admitted to acting alone. The student was ordered by the university to serve community service hours and repay the costs for the damaged issues. The Courier&#x27;s advisor said that there was no lingering animosity between the paper and MEChA and that leaders from both organizations had met to discuss the incident.

==Name change==
At the 2010 National Conference in Seattle, the name of the organization was changed to Movimiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztlán.

At the 2016 National MEChA Conference in Tucson, AZ; the name of the Organization was changed to Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán.
In April 2019, student leaders voted to drop &quot;Chicano&quot; and &quot;Aztlán&quot; from the group name. This was done in response to a conversation concerning whether the words are homophobic, anti-black, and anti-indigenous. Latino USA from NPR reports that &quot;the online reactions following the name change reflect the strong reactions as the organization heralds in a new generation of leaders.&quot;

<text>GLAAD () is an American non-governmental media monitoring organization. Originally founded as a protest against defamatory coverage of gay and lesbian demographics and their portrayals in the media and entertainment industries, it has since expanded to queer, bisexual, and transgender people.

==History==
Formed in New York City as Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in 1985 to protest against what it saw as the &quot;New York Post&quot;″s defamatory and sensationalized AIDS coverage, GLAAD put pressure on media organizations to end what it saw as homophobic reporting. Initial meetings were held in the homes of several New York City activists as well as after-hours at the New York State Council on the Arts. The first reported meeting occurred on November 14, 1985. The founding group included film scholar Vito Russo; Gregory Kolovakos, then on the staff of the NYS Arts Council and who later became the first executive director; Darryl Yates Rist; Allen Barnett; and Jewelle Gomez, the organization&#x27;s first treasurer.

In 1987, after a meeting with GLAAD, &quot;The New York Times&quot; changed its editorial policy to use the word &quot;gay&quot; instead of harsher terms referring to homosexuality. GLAAD advocated that the &quot;Associated Press&quot; and other television and print news sources follow. GLAAD&#x27;s influence soon spread to Los Angeles, where organizers began working with the entertainment industry to change the way the gay and lesbian community were portrayed on screen.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; has named GLAAD as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most powerful entities, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described GLAAD as &quot;possibly one of the most successful organizations lobbying the media for inclusion&quot;.

Within the first five years of its founding in New York as the &quot;Gay and Lesbian Anti-Defamation League&quot; (soon after changed to &quot;Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation&quot; after legal pressure by the Anti-Defamation League), GLAAD chapters had been established in Los Angeles and other cities, with the LA chapter becoming particularly influential due to its proximity to the California entertainment industry. GLAAD/NY and GLAAD/LA would eventually vote to merge in 1994, with other city chapters joining soon afterward; however, the chapters continue to exist, with the ceremonies of the GLAAD Media Awards being divided each year into three ceremonies held in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Following the 2011 resignation of Jarrett Barrios from the GLAAD presidency, Mike Thompson served as interim president until the announcement of Herndon Graddick, previously GLAAD&#x27;s vice-president of Programs and Communications, to the presidency on April 15, 2012. Graddick is the younger son of Charles Graddick of Mobile, a circuit court judge and the former attorney general of Alabama.

In 2013, the year GLAAD changed its name from &quot;Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation&quot; to GLAAD, and Jennifer Finney Boylan was chosen as the first openly transgender co-chair of GLAAD&#x27;s National Board of Directors.

===Name change===
On March 24, 2013, GLAAD announced that it had formally dropped the &quot;Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation&quot; from their name and would now be known only as GLAAD to reflect their work more accurately; the name change was a commitment to incorporate bisexual and transgender people in their efforts to support the LGBTQ+ community in its entirety.

===Executives===
Sarah Kate Ellis is the current president and CEO of GLAAD. Ellis took the positions in 2014 and under her leadership GLAAD&#x27;s revenue grew by 38%. In 2015, Ellis promoted Nick Adams to the newly created position of director of transgender media &amp; representation. Adams started working at GLAAD in 1998 and had previously been GLAAD&#x27;s director of communications &amp; special projects. In 2022, Ellis renegotiated her contract with GLAAD, receiving a $150,000 signing bonus and an average annual salary of $441,000 per year, increasing by 5% each year.

In August 2024, GLAAD and Ellis were the subjects of a The New York Times report that explored the organization&#x27;s reimbursements of Ellis&#x27;s &quot;pattern of lavish spending&quot;, including luxury travel, home renovations and vacation property rentals. In response, GLAAD released a statement defending their commitment to Ellis&#x27;s leadership and their payments towards her expenses. A subsequent Washington Blade op-ed by former GLAAD vice-president Zeke Stokes contested The New York Times reporting as &quot;riddled with bad reporting, innuendo, lies, mistruths, facts out of context, and misinformation.&quot;

==Programs==

===GLAAD Media Awards===

The GLAAD Media Awards were established in 1989. Ceremonies are held annually in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

===Announcing Equality Project===
Established in 2002, GLAAD&#x27;s Announcing Equality project has resulted in more than 1,000 newspapers including gay and lesbian announcements alongside other wedding listings.

===Commentator Accountability Project===
In March 2012, GLAAD launched the Commentator Accountability Project, which seeks to index and document frequent contributors, guests and pundits who regularly express anti-LGBT bias and misinformation in their contributions to journalism outlets.

===Studio Responsibility Index===
In August 2013, GLAAD launched its first annual Studio Responsibility Index, which indexes &quot;the quantity, quality and diversity of images of LGBT people in films released by six major motion picture studios&quot;.

===&quot;GLAAD Media Reference Guide&quot;===
The GLAAD Media Reference Guide is a style guide of recommendations for writers, especially journalistic outlets, to reference in positive, inclusive depiction of LGBT people. It has been published since the 1990s (then known as the &quot;GLAAD Media Guide to the Lesbian and Gay Community&quot;), with the 11th edition, being the most recent, published in 2022.

===Social Media Safety Index===
The 2021 GLAAD Social Media Safety Index, based on an analysis of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube, assessed that social media was &quot;effectively unsafe for LGBTQ users.&quot;

==Movements==
GLAAD has begun the Together Movement, which encourages all to join in support of those discriminated against including women, Muslims, immigrants and members of the LGBTQ+ community.

In 2010, GLAAD launched Spirit Day. Spirit Day is an annual national day of action to show LGBTQ youth that they are not alone.

In 2016, Spirit Day was the world&#x27;s largest and most visible anti-bullying campaign. The campaign works to bring anti-bullying resources to classrooms all around the world by inspiring educators to take action against bullying through hosting events and rallies. The campaign also created a GLAAD&#x27;s Spirit Day kit for use in classrooms, which is available in 6 languages.

On social media, people are encouraged to wear purple or go purple online in order to stand united against bullying. Large media companies such as NBC Universal and Viacom show support for Spirit Day on the airwaves, and change their on-air logo to purple for the day. They also enlist people who wear purple during the day&#x27;s broadcast. The hashtag #Spirit Day has become a trending topic on Twitter and Facebook every year. On social media, people such as Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and President Barack Obama have shown their support for the campaign.

==Media consultation==
GLAAD has at times worked with companies and studios in a consultative role to help with the depiction of LGBT characters and themes in specific projects. In 2004, Fox provided GLAAD with an advance copy of their reality television special &quot;Seriously, Dude, I&#x27;m Gay&quot; for review. Upon review of the special, GLAAD condemned it as &quot;an exercise in systematic humiliation.&quot; The special was shelved only hours before a scheduled meeting between GLAAD and Fox entertainment president Gail Berman to discuss the network&#x27;s on-air depictions of gay men. Ray Giuliani, an executive producer of &quot;Seriously, Dude, I&#x27;m Gay&quot;, largely attributed the special&#x27;s cancellation to pressures that Fox faced from GLAAD. Following the cancellation of the special, Fox organized another meeting with GLAAD for discussion over how to improve their on-air representations of the LGBT community. Following the cancellation of &quot;Seriously, Dude, I&#x27;m Gay&quot; the executive producers of the TBS series &quot;He&#x27;s a Lady&quot; consulted GLAAD for review of the transgender representation in their own program.

The crossover fighting game &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;, developed by Japanese video game developer and publisher Capcom, was released in 2012. The game features Poison, who is a transgender woman, as a playable character. Capcom worked closely with GLAAD on the game&#x27;s script to ensure they do not &quot;alienate anybody&quot; in regard to Poison&#x27;s representation, and &quot;anything that might be offensive has been very tailored to not be&quot;.

&quot;Tell Me Why&quot; is an episodic narrative adventure game developed by French studio Dontnod Entertainment and published by Xbox Game Studios in 2020. The game focuses on twin siblings Alyson and Tyler Ronan, who is a transgender man. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; was the first Triple-A game to feature a transgender protagonist. GLAAD helped in creating Tyler&#x27;s character, with the game&#x27;s director Florent Guillaume described GLAAD as &quot;invaluable&quot; in developing Tyler&#x27;s character and making him a &quot;realistic hero&quot;. GLAAD&#x27;s director of transgender representation Nick Adams served as consultant who, amongst other areas, helped ensure that Tyler would be played by a trans actor; August Black. Adams described authentic representations of trans people in media as a &quot;powerful tool for acceptance and understanding&quot;.

The third season of &quot;Young Justice&quot; consulted GLAAD on the subject of representing minority characters and narratives.

<text>GLSEN (pronounced &quot;glisten&quot;; formerly the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network) is an American education organization working to end discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression and to prompt LGBT cultural inclusion and awareness in K-12 schools. Founded in 1990 in Boston, Massachusetts, the organization is now headquartered in New York City and has an office of public policy based in Washington, D.C.

 there are 39 GLSEN chapters across 26 states that train 5,000 students, educators, and school personnel each year. The chapters also support more than 4,000 registered school-based clubs—commonly known as gay–straight alliances (GSAs)--which work to address name-calling, bullying, and harassment in their schools. GLSEN also sponsors and participates in a host of annual &quot;Days of Action&quot;, including a No Name-Calling Week every January, a Day of Silence every April, and an Ally Week every September. Guided by research such as its &quot;National School Climate Survey&quot;, GLSEN has developed resources, lesson plans, classroom materials, and professional development programs for teachers on how to support LGBTQ students.

Research shows that in response to bullying and mistreatment, many LGBTQ students avoid school altogether; this can lead to academic failure. To combat this problem, GLSEN has advocated for LGBTQ-inclusive anti-bullying laws and policies. GLSEN has also worked with the U.S. Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services to create model policies that support LGBTQ students and educators. GLSEN has considered their signature legislation to be the Safe Schools Improvement Act and has been honored by the White House as a &quot;Champion of Change&quot;.

== Campaigns and programs ==
=== GLSEN&#x27;s Day of Silence ===
GLSEN&#x27;s Day of Silence is a national day of action that began at the University of Virginia in 1996 in which students vow to take a form of silence to call attention to the silencing effect of anti-LGBTQ bullying and harassment in schools. GLSEN&#x27;s Day of Silence takes place in 8,000 U.S. schools every year and has spread to more than 60 countries.

=== GLSEN&#x27;s No Name-Calling Week ===
Every January, thousands of elementary and middle schools participate in GLSEN&#x27;s No Name-Calling Week to end bullying. No Name-Calling Week was inspired by the popular young adult novel entitled &quot;The Misfits&quot; by popular author James Howe, and is supported by over 60 national partner organizations.

=== GLSEN&#x27;s Ally Week ===
Every fall, GLSEN&#x27;s Ally Week serves to educate allies about the role they play in creating safer spaces for LGBTQ youth. Ally Week was started in 2005 by GLSEN&#x27;s Jump-Start National Student Leadership team. Ally Week is supported by over 20 endorsers.

=== Think Before You Speak campaign ===
On October 8, 2008, GLSEN and Ad Council released the Think Before You Speak campaign, designed to end homophobic vocabulary and raise awareness about the prevalence and consequences of anti-LGBTQ bias and behavior in America&#x27;s schools among youth, through the use of television, radio, print, and outdoor ads.
The campaign also aimed to raise awareness among adults, school personnel, and parents. It includes three television public service announcements (PSAs), six print PSAs and three radio PSAs. Television commercials for the campaign include singer Hilary Duff as well as comedian Wanda Sykes. In 2008 the campaign won the Ad Council&#x27;s Gold Bell award for &quot;Best Public Service Advertising Campaign&quot;.

=== GLSEN Research ===
GLSEN has been conducting research and evaluation on LGBTQ issues in K-12 education since 1999. GLSEN became the only organization to regularly document the school experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) middle and high school students in the U.S. using GLSEN&#x27;s National School Climate Survey. Other research reports GLSEN has put out include &quot;From Statehouse to Schoolhouse: Anti-Bullying Policies in U.S. States and School Districts&quot;, &quot;Shared Differences: The Experiences of LGBTQ Students of Color in Our Nation&#x27;s Schools&quot;, &quot;Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nation&#x27;s Schools&quot;, as well as many other reports, articles, and book chapters.

=== GLSEN National Student Council ===
The GLSEN National Student Council, formerly known as the Student Ambassadors program, is one of GLSEN&#x27;s student leadership teams. Each year, GLSEN selects a small group of middle and high school students to serve as GLSEN youth representatives for the upcoming school year. Students of the National Student Council advise GLSEN on campaigns, bring GLSEN resources to their schools, represent GLSEN in the media, and have their own work published in local and national outlets.

===GLSEN Chapters===
GLSEN Chapters, with the support and guidance of the national office, work to bring GLSEN programs to their specific communities on a local level. Chapter board members and volunteers are students, educators, parents and community members who volunteer their time to support students and Gay-Straight Alliances, train educators and provide opportunities for everyone to make change in their local schools. GLSEN has 38 volunteer-led GLSEN Chapters in 26 states that work with student leaders, provide professional development for educators, and encourage policymakers to enact LGBTQ-inclusive policies.

==GLSEN Respect Awards==
GLSEN organizes the annual GLSEN Respect Awards to honor leaders, personalities, and organizations who have made significant contributions to LGBTQ youth. Awards are given to organizations, celebrities, students, educators and gay–straight alliances. Since 2004, there have been over four dozen honorees and over $15 million raised in all. The first Respect Awards were in New York in 2004 and honored Andrew Tobias, author and Treasurer of the Democratic National Committee; MTV; and student Marina Gatto. Since then, the Respect Awards are held annually in New York in late May and in Los Angeles in late October. Since 2004, there have been over four-dozen honorees and over $17 million raised.


== Fistgate controversy ==
In 2000, the leader of the conservative Parents&#x27; Rights Coalition of Massachusetts (now known as MassResistance) secretly taped one of the 50 workshops in &quot;Teachout 2000&quot;, titled &quot;What They Didn&#x27;t Tell You About Queer Sex and Sexuality in Health Class: Workshop for Youth Only, Ages 14–21&quot;. Students discussed sex in a workshop &quot;billed as a &quot;safe place&quot; for youths to get their questions about their sexuality answered&quot; in the session&#x27;s Q&amp;A section. A question was asked about fisting a minor and an explanation was provided. Greg Carmack subsequently suggested that the question might have been planted by those making the recordings. MassResistance dubbed the incident &quot;Fistgate&quot; and the tapes generated controversy when they were broadcast over radio. A state employee who participated in the discussion and was subsequently dismissed filed suit against Camenker and Scott Whiteman as a result of the distribution of the tape recordings, while others pointed out the legal prohibition against recording people without their knowledge or permission. According to &quot;Bay Windows&quot;, a &quot;Massachusetts Superior Court judge ruled that the tape was illegally acquired and therefore an invasion of privacy against those individuals present, who were never told they were being recorded.&quot;

<text>Cuiheng () is a village of the town of Nanlang, Zhongshan, Guangdong province. Cuiheng is best known as the birthplace of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; of the Republic of China. Cuiheng is southeast of downtown Zhongshan, and north of Macau. The whole village is designated a special economic district, as Cuiheng New Area.

==History==
The village was established in the latter half of the 17th century during the reign of Kangxi Emperor by the Feng and Mai families, who were later joined by the Yang and Lu (陸) families. The Lu surname became most numerous. At the time of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s birth in the 1860s, there were about sixty households with ten surnames. In addition to Sun, Lu Muzhen, Sun&#x27;s first wife and Lu Haodong (1868–1895), an early revolutionary martyr, were also born in Cuiheng.

==Administration==
Cuiheng is administered by Nanlang Township. For a time, Cuiheng village was elevated to the township level and became the town of Cuiheng Village (). However, in 1998 it was downgraded and reintegrated inside the town of Nanlang. On 31 March 2013 Cuiheng was upgraded into a &quot;New Area&quot;.

==Tourism==
Cuiheng is home to the Former Residence of Dr Sun Yat-sen () and the Sun Yat-sen Residence Memorial Museum (), which was built next to the residence in 1956.

<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Afghanistan.

==First stamps==

The first stamps appeared in 1871. They were round in shape, imperforate, and printed in black, with a crude lion&#x27;s head, surrounded by Arabic script specifying one of three denominations. The lion, &quot;sher&quot;, represented the head of state, Sher Ali Khan, as he had been named for the bravery of a lion. Many catalogues and early collectors incorrectly referred to these as &quot;tiger&quot; heads. Cancellation was accomplished by cutting or tearing off a piece of the stamp. Cancellation by postmark was not introduced until 1891. Initially somewhat large, subsequent issues kept the same basic design but were smaller each year, with the last appearing in 1878. Starting in 1876, the stamps were printed in different colors, each color corresponding to one of the main post offices on the Peshawar-Kabul-Khulm route. Each design in a sheet was individually engraved, so the stamps vary considerably in appearance. Many of the Sher Ali issues are readily available, while some sell for hundreds of US$.
The defeat of Sher Ali by the British brought Abdur Rahman Khan to the throne in 1880, and the following year brought new stamps, still round, but with inscriptions in the middle instead of the lion&#x27;s head. The era of round designs ended in 1891 with rectangular issues for the &quot;Kingdom of Afghanistan&quot;. The three designs consisted entirely Arabic script, and were printed in a slate blue color. The 1892 issue featured the national seal consisting of a mosque gate and crossed cannons; it was printed in black on colored paper; at least 10 colors of paper were used, and there are many shades as well, even though all the colors had the same value. In 1894 simplified versions of this design were printed on green paper. The 1898 issues of the national seal on a variety of colored paper were not regularly issued.
In 1907 the first rouletted stamps were issued, along with imperforate varieties, depicting a whole mosque, with various surrounding ornamentation. In the 1909 issue the mosque was displayed inside an eight-pointed star pattern.

==Independence==

The first issue after independence came out on 24 August 1920, a design featuring the royal star of King Amanullah. The three denominations were also the first to use Latin script for the numerals as well as Arabic. Beginning in 1924, each year at least one stamp was issued in February to commemorate independence, a pattern that held steady, with few omissions, until the 1960s.
Afghanistan joined the Universal Postal Union in 1928; previously international mail required stamps of British India. In 1927, the first Roman letters had appeared on an Afghan stamp, the inscription reading &quot;AFGHAN POSTAGE&quot;. This changed to the French &quot;POSTES AFGHANES&quot; in 1928, and remained in that form (with some deviations, as in the 1939 issue) until 1989.

The Afghan stamps of the 1930s and 1940s are rather plain affairs, mostly typographed, with large blank spaces in the design. The definitive series of 1951 was finely engraved by Waterlow and Sons, several featuring portraits of Mohammed Zahir Shah.

A large number of Afghan stamps appeared in the 1960s. Since the Afghan Postal Authority issued some stamps well below the minimal amount of postage, this was considered to be a scheme for making money from stamp collectors. The issues from 1960 on are not especially notable. During this time, a number of politically aligned stamps were produced demonstrating support for Pashtunistan, a political issue that cut relations with Pakistan for several years that decade.

Starting in the mid-1980s, many of the issues were clearly produced to sell to Western stamp collectors; for instance, the ship series of 1986 is not especially relevant in a landlocked country.

==Civil war and after==
The disruption of governance in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to civil war and the rise of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, led to stopping of stamp issues from 1989 to 2001, although the postal service continued to exist it functioned only haphazardly using existing stamp supplies. There are only a few postal items known from the 1996 to 2001 period. During this interim period, many unofficial stamps were printed and distributed, which were disavowed by the Afghanistan postal service in 2000 under the Taliban, and subsequently in 2003 by the Karzai government.

Stamp production resumed when the Taliban regime was overthrown and the Afghan Postal Authority reconstituted. The first issue of a postage stamp after the hiatus was the May 2002 stamp showing Ahmad Shah Massoud, a military general and national hero who defended Afghanistan against the Soviet Union in the 1980s and later led a resistance movement against the Taliban.

During the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan period from 2004 to 2021, the postal service as Afghan Post managed to recreate a network of post offices and services although this sped up after 2017 as Ahmad Wahid Wais became the new company director. Until then the core activities remained the transport of mail and parcels. By early 2020s there were around 3000 postal points for the public to access those services: one or two post offices per province, one postal agent or agency at least per district. Wais extended the activities to freight and e-commerce.

Postage issues were irregular between 2001 and 2017, with only three stamps from 2008 to 2017. However the wish to issue more stamps was limited by local possibilities. President Ashraf Ghani wished governmental documents be printed in Afghanistan, but in 2017 Suhuk, the state printer, did not have machines usable for stamp printing and perforating. Former philatelic chief Walid Saviz testified to philatelist Peter Hornung that the &quot;Shafiq&quot;, &quot;Saffron of Afghanistan&quot; and &quot;President Mohammad Daoud Khan&quot; stamps presented at ceremonies in 2018 were printed in low quality and little numbers or on paper inadequate for stamps (on photographic paper for the 2018 &quot;Abu Rayhan al-Biruni&quot; stamp).

In 2019 quality increased thanks to printing in foreign printing plants. The stamp for the centenary of the independence of Afghanistan, picturing King Amanullah Khan, was printed in China and promoted by the Chinese embassy in Kabul. The 150th anniversary of Gandhi stamp and the Indo-Afghna Friendship stamp were made by the Indian state&#x27;s Security Printing Press in Hyderabad, with the help of the Indian embassy in Kabul, but still in low numbers as the others (around 5000). The last stamp issued before the Taliban retook power was in January 2021 honoring Japanese humanitarian Tetsu Nakamura who was killed in Jalalabad in 2019. It was printed by Suhuk, offered to many visiting foreign dignitaries and in Japan. In 2021 the philatelic service was working on a website on the history of Afghan stamps and an online shop.

The Taliban took Kabul in August 2021. Talib Maulana Rahmatullah Maki was named president of Afghan Post. Until Autumn 2022 the company had prioritised postal operations. No stamps from the previous period were allowed to be sold. In Autumn 2022 the sales of these stamps were finally allowed to collectors, but they can not be used on mail.

The lack of available stamps (either their printed numbers or their prohibition since 2021) implies that mail in Afghanistan has not borne stamps since at least mid-2010s. Afghan Post employees sell blank envelopes and check the contents after the sender has prepared his correspondence; then the employee prints a bill for the postage. Sender has to pay this bill to a counter of the state bank Bank-e-Millie Afghan and had to come back with a bank receipt. Then his mail is accepted as paid in cash. The procedure is to avoid postal employees&#x27; corruption.

As of January 2023 Afghan Post deputy director Hamed Naseri was preparing stamp issues: on the new Qosh Tepa Canal, the departure of the last U.S. soldier, and on production of saffron. Possibly a reissue of the 2019 Gandhi stamp could happen. Problems were to find a printing plant abroad and to open a web shop whereas the Taliban&#x27;s Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is facing international sanctions, especially on financial transfers.

<text>The Baptist Union of Norway () is a Baptist Christian denomination in Norway. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Stabekk.

==History==

===First congregations===

The first Baptist in Norway was Enok Richard Haftorsen Svee. Raised in a Haugianer family in Orkanger, he moved to Copenhagen in 1837 to attend missionary training. There he came into contact with a group of unorganized Baptists and participated in the founding of Denmark&#x27;s first Baptist congregation the following year. This was illegal at the time. Svee returned to Orkanger in 1842 and died a year later, never establishing a congregation in Norway.

The Parliament of Norway passed the Dissenter Act on 16 July 1845, allowing Christian congregations outside the Church of Norway to be established. The Swedish Baptist Fredrik Olaus Nilsson visited Norway several times from 1851, but his preaching was futile. Instead the Danish preacher Fredrik L. Rymker from Odense was successful at establishing a congregation. The Danish community dispatched him to Norway to preach. He arrived in Skien on 21 September 1857 and started preaching in the various free churches there. He also travel around to neighboring towns. Carl Gundersen Kongerød became the first Baptist baptized in Norway, on 25 December 1858. By 22 April 1860 there were nine Baptists in the area and the Baptist congregation in Porsgrunn and Solum was founded.
Rymker continued to travel and preach until 1862, funded through grants from congregations in the United States. He helped establish Larvik Baptist Congregation on 14 November 1860 and Kragerø Baptist Congregation on 31 August 1862. A congregation of baptists in Levanger was founded in 1862. New preachers arrived in Norway and the cause spread throughout the 1860s. Eidsvoll Baptist Congregation was founded on 29 August 1864 and in Melum on 25 December 1865. Additional congregations were founded in Arendal presumably on 14 August 1867, followed by Bergen, Tromsø and Tvedestrand in 1870. Two years later congregations were established in the towns of Langesund, Risør and Trondheim.

Focus shifted to the capital Kristiania (today Oslo). The Swedish pastor Sven Svensson visited the city, funded by the Baptist Missionary Society (BMS) and helped incorporate a congregation in 1874. It became the subject of personal conflicts and part of the congregation split in favor of the Adventist Church, and the organization was disestablished in 1880. It was reestablished in 1884 and within a decade had become the largest Baptist congregation in the country.
All the congregations were established as independent denominations under the protection that the Dissenter Act provided, even if they could have as few as six members. Following a movement inspired by the United States, there was a trend towards weak congregationalism. This established a common understanding of the legal and organizational independence of each congregation, while retaining the need for a national administrative and theological coordination. By the early 1870s the congregations in Skien, Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø had largely taken on regional responsibilities and covered areas far exceeding the city limits.

===Establishing the union===
The Sønnenfjellske District Association was founded in 1872 as a cooperative body in Eastern Norway. Tromsø Missionary Society was founded in 1877. It originally was a subset of the Tromsø congregation, but was soon joined by newly established congregations in Northern Norway. The same year the congregations in Trondheim and Bergen established Vestenfjellske Missionary Society. These were responsible for inter-congregational coordination and activities, especially evangelism.

The first national conference took place on 6 to 8 July 1877 in Bergen, with ten delegates from five congregations. For the first time the number of Baptists were calculated, totaling 511 at the end of 1867. The main organization outcome was the establishment of a committee to establish a common Sunday school curriculum. The following year a meeting was held in Bergen with most of the pastors in the country. BMS attended with a representative, Edward Bean Underhill. An agreement was made whereby a national union would be established and receive financial support from BMS. Another outcome of the meeting was the foundation of Adelfia, an association for the pastors.
The formal decision to establish the Baptist Union of Norway was taken at the second national conference, held in Trondheim the following year. Thirteen delegates from eight congregations participated. Nine congregations joined the union; the remaining six refrained either because they were not represented at the conference or because they were feared the union would interfere in congregational affairs. Janne M. Sjödahl was appointed the union&#x27;s first chairman.

It was officially founded in 1879.

The first inter-congregational bulletin was , first published by G. Hübert in 1879. Three years later the hymnal was published. Adelfia began publishing the national newsletter in 1880. These initiatives led to the union establishing a publishing office, .
The Baptist communities in Norway enjoyed close relations with BMS in England and Scandinavian expatriate congregations in the United States through the American Baptist Missionary Union (ABMU). The latter was mostly concentrated in Minnesota. After first establishing a common Scandinavian seminary, it split and a Norwegian–Danish seminary was established in the Chicago community of Morgan Park as part of the Baptist Union Theological Seminary (later to become the University of Chicago Divinity School). This remained the main point of contact with the American Baptist community. Forty-two Norwegians attended the seminary from 1884 to 1910.

The establishment of the seminary caused a close connection between the Norwegian Baptist congregations and that of the Midwestern United States; it was the source of new inspiration. A major step took place in 1885 when pastors began to be ordained. The number of Baptist congregations reached eighteen in 1886, although the membership growth was significantly steeper with 1,335 members that year. Ten years later it had increased to 26 congregations and 2,132 members. It reached 35 congregations and 2,900 members in 1902.

BMS announced in 1890 that it would withdraw all financial support for work in Norway starting in 1892. They cited that Norway no longer was seen as a missionary site, and that recruitment had leveled off. They also argued that the congregations should have the capacity to fund their own operations. The Baptist Union of Norway therefore contacted the Norwegian expatriate community. ABMU offered support to the union on the condition the Norwegians would preach in line with the American organization&#x27;s theology and that Norwegian international missionaries would represent ABMU.

===Establishment of institutions===

The Baptist Union of Norway became a founding member of the Baptist World Alliance in 1905 and J. A. Øhrn became an inaugural vice president. The Norwegian Baptist Theological Seminary was founded in 1910, allowing both pastors and missionaries to be educated domestically for the first time. Olaf J. Øie was hired as the first rector, a role he held until his death in 1943. The seminary soon offered a bachelor-level degree.

A separate Norwegian mission was founded at the annual conference in 1915. Fundraising secured Bernhard Ålbu&#x27;s travel to the Belgian Congo. This was the first time that Norwegian Baptist missionaries traveled without being under the auspices of the ABMU. Due to the First World War he was not able to travel until 1918. The effort was concentrated in the Bas-Uele District, especially in the settlements of Bili and Monga. The network was gradually expanded and by the 1970s there were additional missionary stations in Bondo, Butu, Likati and Ndu. By 1945 the Congo mission had baptized 3,000 converts.

The Baptist Women&#x27;s Association of Norway was founded in 1916 to coordinate women&#x27;s work between the congregations. This included both evangelism and missions, as well as annual seminars. The Baptist Youth Association was founded in 1922 to coordinate the activities of the youth associations in each congregation. From 1921 the local congregation operated a fishermen&#x27;s home in Honningsvåg. Another attempt to spread the word in Northern Norway took place through the &quot;skerries mission&quot;. Boats were used to reach coastal hamlets without regular church services.
The organization saw its membership hit a plateau during the 1900s, but then saw significant growth again during the 1910s. Membership numbers grew again during the 1930s and hit an all-time high of 7,500 members in the late 1940s. By then Pentecostalism was increasing in Norway. Many Baptists changed to Pentecostal congregations and locally there was often competition for the same congregants. Similarities in theological stances, especially regarding baptism and congregationalism, often eased the transition between congregations.

Along with the Baptist Union of Denmark and the Baptist Union of Sweden, the Norwegian union established a congregation in San Francisco, the Scandinavian Seamen Mission in 1946. Two Norwegians have been secretary-general of the Baptist World Alliance. The first was Arnold T. Øhrn from 1948 to 1960, and his successor Josef Nordenhang from 1960 to 1969. The Baptist Folk High School was inaugurated in 1958. It changed its name to Holtekilen Folk High School in 1979.
Many of the smallest congregations had problems funding both a church and the pastor&#x27;s wages. In some congregations this was solved by only hiring the pastor part-time, or having them funded through their spouse working. In any case wages were comparatively low for the education. From the 1960s a &quot;wage fund&quot; was created, whereby larger congregations subsidized the wages of pastors in smaller congregations. The Baptist Study Council was established in 1972 to publish study circles. This agency remained until 2010. The missionary activity was expanded from 1984, when the annual conference voted to allow mission to other countries than Zaïre.

Oppdal Baptist Congregation left the union in 1986. During the mid-1980s the union experienced major economic problems and a large deficit. The congress of the European Baptist Federation was hosted in Lillehammer in 1994, with the union as the organizer. Four thousand delegates participated at the event at Håkons Hall. The union launched its website on 19 February 1996. was reorganized in 2004 and changed from a weekly newspaper to a monthly magazine. It took the name &quot;Baptist.no&quot; in 2009.

Oslo Third Baptist Congregation was excluded from the union in 2006 after it had elected a member living in a same-sex partnership to its board. After decades with stagnating membership, the Baptist community experienced rising membership numbers and increasing number of congregations from the late 2000s. The Norwegian Baptist Seminary was reorganized in 2008. It merged with the Pentecostal Center for Leadership and Theology to form the Norwegian School of Leadership and Theology. It was accredited as a college and was situated at the Baptist complex at Stabekk.

==Organization==

The union has 97 congregations. Membership is tied to the individual congregations rather than to the union. Based on a form of weak congregationalism, these are autonomous organizations which elect their own leadership. The union therefore acts as a coordinating organization. The congregations are organized into five regional districts, each with their own board. The union has an annual meeting with delegates from each congregation. This body holds the supreme authorities within the union. It appoints the main board, other committees and various issues regarding economy, institutions and plans.

The head office is situated at Stabekk in Bærum Municipality outside Oslo. The union has an administration with seven employees, led by Secretary-General Terje Aadne. The Baptist Union of Norway is a member of the Baptist World Alliance, the European Baptist Federation and the Christian Council of Norway.

==Membership==
Statistics Norway counted 10,283 members of the Baptist Union of Norway in 2014. This is based on the official reported numbers of adherents to the state for state grants. This number includes children and non-baptized adherents.

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 103 churches and 6,651 members.

==Institutions==

The Norwegian School of Leadership and Theology is an accredited college jointly owned by the Baptist Union and Filadelfia Oslo, a Pentecostal congregation. Approved by the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education, it offers a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in leadership and theology, and a one-year course in Christianity. Although not a formal requirement, most pastors have taken a four-year theological education at the college.

Holtekilen Folk High School is situated at Stabekk and has 85 pupils. It features six tracks: music, fashion/design, travel, film/photography, street sociology and ethics/sustainability.

The union publishes a monthly magazine, &quot;Baptist.no&quot;, which is distributed to all members of the congregations. The Norwegian Baptist Historical Society is given the task of maintaining Baptist archives in Norway and publishing historical and theological presentations. Its main work is the semi-annual magazine &quot;Baptist&quot; which provides articles on Baptist history, theology and practice. It also publishes literature.

<text>Chadron State College (CSC) is a public college in Chadron, Nebraska, United States. It is one of three public colleges in the Nebraska State College System. It practices open admissions.

The school opened in June 1911, although a previous institution dated from the late 19th century. The college has an enrollment of about 2,200 students. Five of its twenty-five major buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

== Presidents ==
The following is a list of the presidents of the college since its founding.
== 2006 Spotted Tail wildfire ==
In late July 2006, the college was in danger of damage from a wildfire. The Spotted Tail fire was caused by a lightning strike on July 26 about seven miles (11 km) south of Chadron. By July 28, the wildfire reached the edge of Chadron and the college campus. Fire crews prevented the wildfire from reaching the campus. The Pine Ridge escarpment south of the college, including C-Hill, was deforested as a result of the fire.

== Facilities ==
The campus has 25 major buildings, five of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Their replacement value is more than $60 million and they provide more than 1 million square feet (92,900 square meters) of floor space. Classrooms, laboratory, and research facilities are available in seven classroom buildings and the library.

The library contains the equivalent of more than 250,000 volumes. Its automated catalogue is part of the Nebraska State College network.

Since the 1980s, the college has built several new facilities, including the Edwin and Avis Nelson Physical Activity Center, a wood-fired heating plant, the Student Center, the Lindeken-Carillon Clock Tower, a softball field, the Chicoine Center athletic facility, the Eagle Ridge housing complex, and the Rangeland Complex. An outdoor track completed construction in 2020. Multiple buildings have been renovated since 2004, including Joseph Sparks Hall, which houses administrative and alumni offices; Edna Work Hall, a dormitory; the former Administration Building, now called Old Admin, which houses academic programs and classrooms; and Don Beebe Stadium, including the rebuilt Con Marshall Press Box and Elliott Field. The college&#x27;s Math Science Building is currently being renovated and is planning to be reopened Spring 2022.

Students can live in seven housing spaces.

== Academics ==
Chadron State College is the only four-year and graduate-degree granting college in western Nebraska; it is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission with some programs and academic units also accredited by discipline-specific organizations.

<doc id="338636" wikidata="Q642685" url="?curid=338636" title="European rock pipit">
<text>The European rock pipit (Anthus petrosus), or simply rock pipit, is a species of small passerine bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are two subspecies, of which the nominate is non-migratory, and the Fennoscandian one is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further west and south in Europe. The European rock pipit is territorial at least in the breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab.

European rock pipits construct a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16 days to fledging. Although insects are occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the rocks or from shallow water.

The European rock pipit may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or act as an involuntary host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The family Motacillidae consists of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest of these groups is the pipits in the genus &quot;Anthus&quot;, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the European rock pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were considered subspecies of the water pipit until they were separated by the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1998. The European rock pipit is closely related to the meadow, red-throated and rosy pipits as well as its former subspecies.

The first formal description naming this species was by English naturalist George Montagu in 1798. It had previously been described in 1766 by Thomas Pennant, in the first edition of &quot;British Zoology&quot;, although he did not distinguish it from the common titlark (meadow pipit). It was first shown to be different from that species by John Walcott in the 1789 edition of his &quot;Synopsis of British Birds&quot;, in which he called it the sea lark. John Latham was the first to give the European rock pipit a scientific name, &quot;Alauda obscura&quot; in 1790, but his name was an invalid homonym, the same name being used a year earlier by Gmelin for a different bird from Sardinia. In the same year, Montagu, whom Latham had consulted about the bird, found European rock pipits on the coast of South Wales, where it was known to some fishermen in the region as the &quot;rock lark&quot;. He adopted that name for the species and gave it the scientific name &quot;Alauda petrosa&quot;.

The scientific name of the European rock pipit is from Latin. &quot;Anthus&quot; is the name given by Pliny the Elder to a small bird of grasslands, and the specific &quot;petrosus&quot; means &quot;rocky&quot;, from &quot;petrus&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;.

There are two recognised subspecies of the European rock pipit:
The suggested subspecies &quot;A. p. kleinschmidti&quot; on the Faroe Islands, Shetland, and Orkney, &quot;A. p. meinertzhageni&quot; on South Uist, &quot;A. p. hesperianus&quot; on the Isle of Arran, and &quot;A. p. ponens&quot; in northwestern France cannot be reliably separated from the nominate subspecies and are now included in it. There is a geographical cline in appearance, with longer-billed, darker birds at the western end of the range, and shorter-billed, paler individuals in the east.

==Description==
The European rock pipit is long and weighs . The nominate race has smoky-olive upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and buff underparts, heavily marked with poorly defined brown streaks. The legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish, and there is a pale eye-ring. The sexes are alike; although males average slightly brighter than females, the overlap is complete and birds cannot be sexed on appearance or measurements. Immature birds resemble the adult, although they may sometimes be browner and more streaked above, looking superficially similar to meadow pipits.

The eastern subspecies &quot;A. p. littoralis&quot; can only be reliably distinguished from the nominate subspecies in summer plumage, when it may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow), thereby resembling the water pipit. European rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but very difficult to assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations are known to be nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly &quot;littoralis&quot;. Ringing results show that &quot;A. p. littoralis&quot; birds from Scandinavia winter widely within the breeding range of &quot;A. p. petrosus&quot; in Britain as well as further south in western Europe; they are sometimes, but not always, separated ecologically, tending to use more sheltered and muddier, less stony, coasts. Virtually all rock pipits in southeastern England (where &quot;A. p. petrosus&quot; does not breed) are &quot;A. p. littoralis&quot;.

Adult European rock pipits have a complete moult in August–September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers.

The European rock pipit is closely related to the water pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the European rock pipit is darker, larger and longer-winged than its relative, and has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the European rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium and greyer upperparts; it is also typically much warier. The European rock pipit&#x27;s dusky, rather than white, outer tail feathers are also a distinction from all its relatives. The habitats used by European rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting.

The European rock pipit&#x27;s song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling &quot;cheepa&quot; notes followed by a rising series of thin &quot;gee&quot; calls, and finishing with a short trill. The shrill &quot;pseep&quot; flight call is intermediate between the soft &quot;sip sip sip&quot; of the meadow pipit and the water pipit&#x27;s short, thin &quot;fist&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European rock pipit is almost entirely coastal, frequenting rocky areas typically below , although on St Kilda it breeds at up to . The European rock pipit is not troubled by wind or rain, although it avoids very exposed situations. It may occur further inland in winter or on migration.

The breeding range is temperate and Arctic Europe on western and Baltic Sea coasts, with a very small number sometimes nesting in Iceland. The nominate race is largely resident, with only limited movement. &quot;A. p. littoralis&quot; is largely migratory, wintering on coasts from southern Scandinavia to southwest Europe, with a few reaching Morocco. Wanderers have reached Spitsbergen and the Canary Islands, but records in Europe away from the coast are rare. For example, a male shot at Dresden in 1894, now in the collection of the local State Museum of Zoology, is the sole specimen for Saxony.

Migratory populations leave their breeding grounds in September and October, returning from March onwards, although in the far north they may not arrive before May.

==Behaviour==
The European rock pipit is a much more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas its relative is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.

===Breeding===
The European rock pipit is highly territorial in the breeding season, and throughout the year where it is resident. Breeding males have a song display in which they fly to above the ground, then circle or descend to the ground with a fluttering &quot;parachute&quot; flight. Territorial males will sometimes enter the territory of an adjacent male to cooperate in evicting an intruder. This behaviour, which requires the ability to distinguish the resident from the intruder, is only otherwise known from the African fiddler crab.

Eggs are laid from early to mid-April in Britain and Ireland, from mid-May in southern Scandinavia, and from June in the north. The nest is always close to the shore, in a cliff crevice or hole, or under the cover of vegetation. It is constructed by the female from seaweed and dead grass, and lined with finer fibres or hair.

The clutch is four to six eggs, glossy pale grey with darker grey or olive speckles mainly at the wider end. They measure and weigh , of which 5% is shell. They are incubated for 14–16 days to hatching, almost entirely by the female, although males have been recorded as occasionally helping. The naked altricial chicks are brooded by the female and fledge in about 16 days. Both parents may feed the chicks for several days after fledging. There may be two broods in a year in the south of the pipit&#x27;s range, and just one further north.

In a British survey, a hatching rate of 82% and a fledging rate of 78% gave an overall 58% nesting success, with an average 2.5 surviving young per pair. In contrast, a study in northwestern France found juvenile mortality was nearly 70%. The average lifespan is not recorded, although the maximum recorded age is 10.9 years.

===Feeding===
The European rock pipit&#x27;s feeding habitat is rocky coasts, rather than the damp grassland favoured by the water pipit. The European rock pipit feeds mainly on invertebrates, seeking out most of its prey on foot, only occasionally flying to catch insects. It will venture into shallow water as it follows retreating waves, and may take advantage of human activity that exposes sea slaters or other species that hide under stones.

Food items include snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The proportions of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae are important in Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc &quot;Assiminea grayana&quot; in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the European rock pipits when there is less prey available.

==Predators and parasites==
The European rock pipit is hunted by birds of prey including the Eurasian sparrowhawk. As with other members of its genus, it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. Eggs laid by cuckoos that specialise in using pipits as their hosts are similar in appearance to those of the pipit.

The European rock pipit is also a host to the flea &quot;Ceratophyllus borealis&quot;, and several other flea species in the genera &quot;Ceratophyllus&quot; and &quot;Dasypsyllus&quot;. The Eurasian rock pipit can benefit from parasitism of the common periwinkle &quot;Littorina littoria&quot; by the castrating trematode &quot;Parorchis acanthus&quot;. Beaches can become attractive where the decline of the periwinkle results in more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrates and a greater diversity of smaller &quot;Littorina&quot; snails as food for the pipits.

==Status==
Estimates of the breeding population of the European rock pipit vary, but may be as high as 408,000 pairs, of which around 300,000 pairs are in Norway. Despite slight declines in the British population and some range expansion in Finland, the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this reason it is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.

Breeding densities vary from 0.9–6 pairs/km (1.4–9.7 pairs/mi) of coast depending on the quality of the habitat. There are few threats, although oil spills can temporarily reduce the invertebrate population of affected rocky coasts.
