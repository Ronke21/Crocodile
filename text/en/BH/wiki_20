<text>Wyrd Sisters is Terry Pratchett&#x27;s sixth &quot;Discworld&quot; novel, published in 1988. It re-introduces Granny Weatherwax of &quot;Equal Rites&quot;.

== Plot ==
&quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; features three witches: Granny Weatherwax; Nanny Ogg, matriarch of a large tribe of Oggs and owner of the most evil cat in the world; and Magrat Garlick, the junior witch, who firmly believes in occult jewelry, covens, and bubbling cauldrons, much to the annoyance of the other two.

King Verence I of Lancre is murdered by his cousin, Duke Felmet, after his ambitious wife persuades him to do so. The King&#x27;s crown and child are given by an escaping servant to the three witches. The witches hand the child to a troupe of travelling actors, and hide the crown in the props box. They acknowledge that destiny will eventually take its course and that the child, Tomjon, will grow up to defeat Duke Felmet and take his rightful place as king.

However, the kingdom is angry about the way the new King is mistreating the land and his subjects. The witches realise that it will be at least 15 years until Tomjon is able to return and save the kingdom, but by then irreparable damage will have been done. Granny Weatherwax, with help from the other two witches, manages to cast a spell over the entire kingdom to send it forward in time by 15 years. Meanwhile, the duke has decided to have a play written and performed that portrays him in a favourable light and the witches in a negative light. He thinks this will cause the witches to lose their power, and the people will like him. He sends the court Fool to Ankh-Morpork to recruit the same acting company that Tomjon was given to, which now resides in the Dysk Theatre on the river Ankh.

The company make their way to Lancre, and perform the play for the King as asked. However, Hwel, the playwright, maintains that there is something wrong with the plot of the play, something that just doesn&#x27;t feel right. The witches cast a spell in the middle of the play that causes the actors to portray the killing of the king truthfully, and the audience sees that the Duke and Duchess are guilty of killing Verence I. Felmet finally succumbs to insanity and stabs several people with a retracting stage dagger, before tripping and falling to his death in the Lancre Gorge. The Duchess is imprisoned but manages to escape, only to be killed by a collection of various forest animals who want revenge for the poor treatment of the land.

Granny Weatherwax explains that Tomjon is the rightful king, and he is due to be crowned. However, Tomjon does not want to be king; he is an extremely talented actor and wishes to continue his career with his adopted father, Vitoller. Instead Granny Weatherwax tells the town that the Fool is in fact the king&#x27;s son from another mother, and Tomjon&#x27;s half-brother, and he is crowned King Verence II of Lancre. Later on, Granny and Nanny reveal to Magrat that the previous fool is actually Tomjon&#x27;s and Verence II&#x27;s father. The status of Magrat and Verence II, who have been awkwardly courting throughout the story, is not fully explained at the conclusion.

== Outside references ==

The text makes overt references to the Marx Brothers, The Tramp of Charlie Chaplin, and Laurel and Hardy, as well as the life and works of William Shakespeare. It borrows themes and sayings from &quot;Macbeth&quot;, including &quot;when shall we three meet again&quot;, the &quot;dagger of the mind&quot;, &quot;out damned spot&quot;, the three witches, and the title of the novel itself; from &quot;Hamlet&quot;, including the ghost of the dead King and the play within a play; &quot;all the world&#x27;s a stage&quot; from &quot;As You Like It&quot;; and Duke Felmet descending into madness in the company of his Fool, derived from &quot;King Lear&quot;. In addition, the company of actors includes a playwright by the name of &quot;Hwel&quot; or &quot;Will&quot;, and, at Tomjon&#x27;s instigation, the company is building a theatre called The Dysk in Ankh-Morpork, a reference to the Globe Theatre in London. Hwel wants to write plays that are more than just &quot;stabbing and shouting&quot;. A speech he wrote merely to cover a scene change resembles the &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; speech from Henry V. Tomjon declaims it in &quot;The Mended Drum&quot; tavern, quieting a brawl in progress. Tomjon reads some of Hwel&#x27;s rejected ideas, which echo pantomime dialogue, the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
There are numerous adaptations, including:
* An animated version and a 4-part BBC Radio 4 dramatisation first aired in 1995 (starring Sheila Hancock as Granny Weatherwax, Lynda Baron as Nanny Ogg, and Deborah Berlin as Magrat Garlick). The radio version added details not in the book, such as the first arrival of the players in Lancre, when a sarcastic Hwel the dwarf is sent to sleep in the stables apart from humans. The character of Lady Felmet is more bloodthirsty, with a fondness for being &quot;bound, and corseted&quot;.
* A play adaptation by Stephen Briggs, who has written a new adaptation to mark Discworld&#x27;s 25th Anniversary
* A film script by Martin Jameson (text published 1997), directed and produced by Jean Flynn for Channel 4. 
* Cosgrove Hall Films produced a six-part animated television adaptation, which was first broadcast by Channel 4 on 18 May 1997. An all-star cast consisted of Christopher Lee (as Death), Jane Horrocks (as Magrat Garlick), June Whitfield (as Nanny Ogg), and Annette Crosbie (as Granny Weatherwax).

<doc id="325980" wikidata="Q1638557" url="?curid=325980" title="Hurricane Camille">
<text>Hurricane Camille was a powerful, deadly and destructive tropical cyclone which became the second most intense on record to strike the United States (behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane) and is one of the four Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall in the United States.

The most intense storm of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Camille originated as a tropical depression on August 14, south of Cuba, from a long-tracked tropical wave. Located in a favorable environment for strengthening, the storm quickly intensified into a Category 2 hurricane before striking the western part of Cuba on August 15. Emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, Camille underwent another period of rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane the next day as it moved northward towards Louisiana and Mississippi. Despite weakening slightly on August 17, the hurricane quickly re-intensified back into a Category 5 hurricane before it made landfall a half hour before midnight in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. At peak intensity, the hurricane had peak 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of , the second-lowest pressure recorded for a U.S. landfall behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. As Camille pushed inland, it quickly weakened and was a tropical depression by the time it was over the Ohio Valley. Once it emerged offshore, Camille was able to restrengthen to a strong tropical storm before becoming extratropical on August 22. Camille was absorbed by a frontal storm over the North Atlantic later that day.

Camille caused tremendous damage in its wake and produced a peak official storm surge of . It flattened nearly everything along the Mississippi coast and caused additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. In the U.S., Camille killed more than 259 people and caused $1.42 billion in damages (equivalent to $ in ).

==Meteorological history==

Hurricane Camille originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August 5, 1969. It tracked quickly westward along the 15th parallel north; several days later, a tropical disturbance became clearly identifiable on satellite imagery on August 9. By that time, the thunderstorm activity in the disturbance concentrated into a circular area of convection. On the next day, the storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, although there was no evidence of a closed circulation. On August 13, the wave passed near or over the southern coast of Jamaica as its convection spread northeastward through the Bahamas. Subsequently, it began a slower motion to the northwest. It is believed that the tropical wave organized into a tropical depression shortly thereafter, early on August 14, and it became a tropical storm a few hours later. On the morning of August 14, the Hurricane Hunters flew to investigate for a closed circulation near the Bahamas and near the Cayman Islands. The crew observed a developing center in the western Caribbean, and winds had reached tropical storm status. By then, the storm had strengthened into a strong tropical storm with winds of , about west-northwest of Grand Cayman.

Upon first being classified as a tropical storm, Camille was located in an area favorable for further strengthening, although initially it slowly intensified. It was located within an area of very light wind shear and an overall warm environment. Additionally, the storm developed strong low-level inflow from the deep southern Caribbean, which continuously brought moisture into the storm. Throughout its duration, it was a small tropical cyclone, although with a radius of gale-force winds spreading to the north, the storm&#x27;s thunderstorm area quickly spread over Cuba. As the storm approached the western coast of Cuba, it began rapid deepening, reaching hurricane status and less than 12 hours later attained winds of . Prior to landfall, its eye was tracked by radar from Havana; it is estimated the hurricane moved ashore between Cape San Antonio and Guane late on August 15 as a strong Category 2 hurricane. Camille was a small hurricane as it crossed western Cuba, and its winds decreased slightly to over land before it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico.
Initially, Hurricane Camille was forecast to turn northeastward toward the Florida panhandle. Instead, it continued northwestward and resumed its rapid intensification trend after leaving Cuba. Its eye contracted to a diameter of less than , and strong rainbands developed around the entire hurricane. Due to the small eye, Hurricane Hunters at first had difficulties in determining the strength; however a flight late on August 16 found a strong Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale and recorded a very low pressure of 908 mbar (hPa; 26.82 inHg), with winds estimated at . At the time, it was not expected to intensify further. However, a subsequent Hurricane Hunters flight early on August 17 recorded a slightly deeper central pressure of 905 mbar (hPa; 26.73 inHg), at the time the lowest pressure recorded by reconnaissance aircraft. That made Camille the most intense hurricane since the 1935 Labor Day hurricane; currently it is the sixth-most intense Atlantic hurricane, as ranked by lowest pressure. There was little change in the wind speed as such levelled out at during that time.

As it continued toward the Gulf Coast of the United States, Camille maintained its small eye, and forecasters continued to anticipate a turn toward Florida. Late on August 17, Camille briefly weakened to a Category 4 storm due to an eyewall replacement cycle; a reconnaissance flight was forced to end its mission early due to a damaged engine. Before they left the storm, the crew recorded a pressure of 919 mbar (hPa; 27.14 inHg) and estimated surface winds at , while Camille was located about southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. There were no subsequent Hurricane Hunter flights, but surface observations recorded later suggested that Camille quickly re-strengthened and regained Category 5 intensity. After passing very close to southeastern Louisiana, Hurricane Camille made landfall at 11:30 CDT in Waveland, Mississippi. Maximum sustained wind speeds near the coastline were estimated to have been about , with a minimum central pressure of 900 mbar (hPa; 26.58 inHg) as analyzed by surface data.

The hurricane weakened as it progressed inland, and within 14 hours of moving ashore, Camille weakened to tropical storm status. About 12 hours later, it weakened to tropical depression status, by which time it began a turn to the north and northeast. On August 20, Tropical Depression Camille turned eastward through Kentucky, dropping heavy rainfall in West Virginia and Virginia. Later that day, it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean east of Norfolk, and by that afternoon, as Camille was emerging offshore it regained tropical storm status. Camille accelerated east-northeastward, attaining peak winds of as it interacted with larger Hurricane Debbie to its southeast (although the poor sampling of the region means that it is possible that the storm may have regained hurricane intensity in a location where measurements of wind speed were not taken). Subsequently, Camille began to interact with a frontal storm, causing it to gradually transition into an extratropical cyclone as it entrained cooler air. On August 22, Camille was absorbed by the frontal system to the south of Atlantic Canada.

==Preparations==

Shortly after Camille formed, the National Hurricane Center advised residents on the Isle of Pines and in western Cuba to prepare for gale-force winds, heavy rains, and rising tides. The agency also recommended small boats to remain in harbor. The threat of the storm prompted officials to evacuate thousands along the western coast of Cuba and on the Isle of Pines; on the island, 10,000 cattle and 6,000 turkeys were moved to safer areas.

As Camille impacted Cuba, small craft were advised not to venture out too far from the coasts of Florida. On August 15, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for a stretch of land in Florida, between Apalachicola and Fort Walton Beach. The next day, as these hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning, thousands of people boarded up their homes and evacuated inland. During the afternoon of August 16, the weather bureau ordered that a hurricane watch should be placed in force for the coastline from Biloxi to St Marks, Florida. Later that day, the hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning for the northwestern Florida coast, from Fort Walton to St Marks.

By Saturday morning, a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from Biloxi eastward. Civil defense organizations in coastal counties went on alert. Keesler Air Force Base and the Naval Construction Battalion Center prepared for the storm. By 5 p.m. on Sunday, a hurricane warning was issued for the coast. This activated the National Guard units. Many refused to believe the reports concerning Camille&#x27;s intensity that afternoon. Many people living at elevations of above sea level refused to believe they were going to be submerged. The mayor of Gulfport ordered the release of prisoners from the city jail as winds increased at 9 p.m. on Sunday evening, but none would leave.

==Impact==
Making landfall in Waveland, Mississippi, as a Category 5 hurricane, Camille caused damage and destruction across much of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Because it moved quickly through the region, Hurricane Camille dropped only moderate precipitation in most areas. Areas in and around Pass Christian, its point of landfall, reported from . The area of total destruction in Harrison County, Mississippi was . The total U.S. estimated cost of damage was $1.42 billion (1969 USD). This made Camille tied (with Hurricane Betsy) as the most expensive hurricane in the United States, up to that point. The storm directly killed 143 people along Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. An additional 153 people perished as a result of catastrophic flooding in Nelson County, Virginia and other areas nearby. In all, 8,931 people were injured, 5,662 homes were destroyed, and 13,915 homes experienced major damage, with many of the fatalities being coastal residents who had refused to evacuate.

===Caribbean and Offshore Gulf of Mexico===
As a developing tropical storm, Camille brought rain showers to Grand Cayman, although there were no reports of damage. Stations in Cuba on the outer fringes of the storm reported winds of . East of where it moved ashore, the city of Guane recorded winds of , although no wind reports were taken in the landfall location. The hurricane produced up to near Guane, as well as on the Isle of Pines. On the Isle of Pines, the storm inflicted damage to about 100 houses. Throughout Pinar del Río Province, Camille caused heavy damage, primarily from river flooding; about 20,000 people were left homeless in the province. Strong winds downed trees and power lines, which caused power outages eastward through the capital city of Havana. Initially, the government reported no casualties from the storm. Subsequent research indicated the hurricane killed five people in the country during its passage, and damage was estimated at $5 million (1969 USD).

In the open Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane produced wave heights of at least , as measured by Shell Oil Company. Along the ocean floor, the storm created mudslides which lowered the ocean floor; its combination with strong waves and winds destroyed three oil platforms, including one that at the time was the deepest oil well. Property damages to the offshore oil industry were initially estimated at $100 million (1969 USD).

===Louisiana===

In Louisiana, the barometric pressure fell to at Garden Island. Winds gusted to at Slidell as their pressure sank to on August 19. Almost total destruction was seen from Venice to Buras. Ostrica Lock measured a storm surge of . Water overwashed U.S. Highway 90 to a depth of . The highest rainfall report from the state was from Slidell. Camille caused about $322 million (1969 dollars) of damage in Louisiana. The storm turned just in time to avoid a direct hit to the City of New Orleans, which was devastated just four years prior by Hurricane Betsy. The worst effects in New Orleans proper were flooding from some levees, particularly in the lowest lying areas, including the Lower Ninth Ward, which suffered the most severe flooding during Betsy.

In addition, Camille forced the Mississippi River to flow backwards for a river-distance of 125 miles (from its mouth to a point north of New Orleans). The river further backed up for an additional , to a point north of Baton Rouge.

===Mississippi===

In Mississippi, Camille was significantly worse than Hurricane Betsy. Electricity went out during Camille&#x27;s approach to the Mississippi coastline. United States Highway 90 flooded as a large storm surge overtopped seawalls, leaving a barge along the highway in Gulfport. Fires consumed coastal communities, with the exceptions of Bay St. Louis and Waveland. Camille destroyed the antebellum Trinity Episcopal church in Pass Christian, taking 15 lives. The Dixie White House, where President Woodrow Wilson and his family once stayed, was badly damaged. In Biloxi, Mississippi, the storm surge reached the second floor of the structure. The highest rainfall total recorded was at the Mississippi Test Facility. Mississippi received the worst of the damage. Upon making landfall, Camille produced a storm surge. Along Mississippi&#x27;s entire shore and for some three to four blocks inland, the destruction was nearly complete. The worst-hit areas were Clermont Harbor, Lakeshore, Waveland, Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Long Beach, and the beachfront of Gulfport, Mississippi City, and Biloxi. One of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s waterfront houses for W. L. Fuller, in Pass Christian, was completely destroyed.

More than of rain occurred in Hancock County, and most low-lying areas were flooded with up to of water. U.S. Highway 90, which is close to the shore, was broken up in many areas, and sand and debris blocked much of it. Totals say that 3,800 homes and businesses were completely destroyed. As Camille came ashore, it passed over Ship Island, off the coast of Mississippi; Camille&#x27;s strong storm surge and torrential rains literally split the island in two: the body of water between West Ship Island and East Ship Island is now called &quot;Camille&#x27;s Cut&quot;. Camille had significant ecological effects in the Gulf Coast region. A barrier island chain off the coast of Mississippi and 70% of Dauphin Island were completely inundated by the storm&#x27;s surge. Camille caused about $950 million (1969 dollars) of damage in Mississippi.

====Hurricane Party====
An urban legend about Camille states that 24 residents of the Richelieu Manor Apartments in Pass Christian, Mississippi, which was in the path of the eyewall, held a &quot;hurricane party&quot; as the hurricane made landfall, and that all but one died. In actuality, there was no party; 23 people are known to have stayed in the apartments during the hurricane, eight of whom died despite taking all precautions they knew in order to secure the building. The tale of the party, and the lone survivor, apparently originated with survivor Mary Ann Gerlach, who also told her story in a 1989 episode of &quot;Nova&quot;. Another survivor, Ben Duckworth, has expressed irritation at the story. &quot;There was no hurricane party,&quot; Duckworth reiterated in 2001. &quot;We were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars. We were too tired to party. I can&#x27;t tell you why that story persists, or why people didn&#x27;t put two and two together. I guess the hurricane party makes a good story.&quot;
===Alabama and Florida===
Alabama also experienced damage along U.S. Highway 90: 26,000 homes and over 1,000 businesses were wiped out completely across the state of Alabama. Camille&#x27;s large circulation also resulted in a storm surge in Apalachicola, Florida. The highest rainfall report received within Alabama was two miles northeast of Fairhope. Camille caused about $8 million (1969 dollars) of damage in Alabama. Places farther east across the western Florida panhandle saw lesser rains, as was measured at Pensacola Naval Air Station.

===Ohio Valley and West Virginia===

Camille caused moderate rainfall in Tennessee and Kentucky of between 3 and , helping to relieve a drought in the area, yet in West Virginia, there was flash flooding which destroyed 36 houses and 12 trailers, a total of three quarters of a million dollars in damage.

===Virginia===
Because the hurricane was expected to quickly dissipate over land, few were prepared for the flash flooding. Arriving in Virginia on the evening of August 19, Camille was no longer a hurricane, but it carried high amounts of moisture and contained sufficient strength and low pressure to pull in additional moisture.

A widespread area of western and central Virginia received over of rain from Camille&#x27;s remains, leading to significant flooding across the state. A total of 153 people lost their lives from blunt trauma sustained during mountain slides, related to the flash flooding, not drowning. More than 123 of these deaths, including 21 members of one family, the Huffmans, were in Nelson County. Seven victims of the hurricane in Nelson County remain unidentified, as well as one in Albemarle County. Landslides occurred on hillsides with a slope greater than 35 percent. In Nelson County, the number of deaths amounted to over one percent of the county&#x27;s population. The worst of the damage was reported in Massies Mill, Woods Mill, Roseland, Bryant, Tyro, Montebello, Lovingston, Norwood, Rockfish, and along the Davis and Muddy creeks. The James and Tye rivers crested well above flood stage in many areas, including a record high of at Columbia. Hurricane Camille caused more than $140 million of damage (1969 dollars) in Virginia. Camille was considered one of the worst natural disasters in central Virginia&#x27;s recorded history.
The storm dropped torrential rainfall of , with a maximum of . Most of the rainfall occurred in Virginia during a 3–5 hour period on August 19–20. More than of rain fell near the North Fork of the Tye River in only half an hour with the grounds already saturated from previous rains. Many rivers flooded across the state, with the worst being the James River in Richmond with a peak crest of . Many rivers in Virginia and West Virginia set records for peak flood stages, causing numerous mudslides along mountainsides. In the mountain slopes between Charlottesville and Lynchburg, more than of rain fell in 12 hours, but the worst was in Nelson County where fell. There, rainfall was so heavy that reports were received of birds drowning in trees, cows floating down the Hatt Creek and of survivors having to cup hands around their mouth and nose in order to breathe through the deluge. Though the official rainfall was recorded as , unofficial estimates are much greater. Some estimate that more than of rain fell at Davis Creek. Most gauges were washed away; however, it was reported that an empty drum that was not even in the center of the heaviest rainfall had of water in it after Camille passed. &quot;So much rain fell in such a short time in Nelson County that, according to the National Weather Service at the time, it was &#x27;the probable maximum rainfall which meteorologists compute to be theoretically possible.&#x27;&quot;

The ensuing flash floods and mudslides killed 153 people. In Nelson County alone, 133 bridges washed out, while in some places entire communities were under water.

The major flooding that occurred downstream cut off all communication between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley. Waynesboro on the South River saw of water downtown, and Buena Vista had more than .

Throughout Virginia, Camille destroyed 313 houses, 71 trailers, and 430 farm buildings. The hurricane affected 3,765 families in the area, and total damage in the state amounted to $140.8 million (1969 USD, $747 million 2005 USD).

==Aftermath==


In the days after the storm struck Cuba, the government deployed medical teams to affected regions to provide typhoid vaccine shots. Officials noted the potential for the spread of disease, due to flooding from Camille as well as previously wet conditions.

The response after the storm involved many federal, state, and local agencies and volunteer organizations. The main organization for coordinating the federal response to the disaster was the Office of Emergency Preparedness, which provided $76 million (1969 USD, $403 million 2005 USD) to administer and coordinate disaster relief programs. Food and shelter were available the day after the storm. On August 19, parts of Mississippi and Louisiana were declared major disaster areas and became eligible for federal disaster relief funds. President Richard Nixon ordered 1450 regular troops and 800 United States Army Engineers into the area to bring tons of food, vehicles, and aircraft. Large organizations contributing to the relief effort included the Federal Power Commission, which helped fully return power to affected areas by November 25, 1969. The Coast Guard (then under the Department of Transportation), Air Force, Army, Army Corps of Engineers, Navy Seabees, and Marine Corps all helped with evacuations, search and rescue, clearing debris, and distribution of food. The Department of Defense contributed $34 million (1969 USD, $180 million 2005 USD) and 16,500 military troops overall to the recovery. The Department of Health provided 
$4 million towards medicine, vaccines and other health related needs.

On Monday, the Air National Guard and those at Keesler Air Force Base airlifted patients to Jackson and other more inland locations. Volunteers searched for those injured and dead, as well as helping refugees. When many of the evacuees returned by Tuesday, Governor John Bell Williams declared martial law, blocking highways into the area and leading to a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. The governor also opened Camp Shelby, dormitories within the University of Southern Mississippi, and the Robert E. Lee Hotel to serve as shelters for those who lost homes. Sections of Bay St. Louis and Pass Christian were evacuated. Survivors were found for days after the storm, with 35 trapped by high water north of Bay St. Louis rescued on Thursday. Army engineers disposed of 25 tons of dead animals, mostly cows, during the week following Camille. One week after the storm, Keesler-based airplanes sprayed malathion at low altitudes to kill the thriving insect population. Martial law would be lifted on August 27. The federal and state military presence would continue for several weeks. During the evening of September 8, President Nixon visited the Biloxi-Gulfport Regional Airport and gave a speech to elevate the spirits of local residents struggling with the storm&#x27;s aftermath. During the rebuilding process, stricter building codes were enforced by local governments. In 1973, hurricane hunters and their associated reconnaissance aircraft relocated to Keesler Air Force Base when their previous headquarters at Ramey, Puerto Rico, closed.
Long-term redevelopment was overseen by the Department of Commerce, which contributed $30 million (1969 USD, $159 million 2005 USD) towards planned and coordinated redevelopment of affected areas. NOAA Weather Radio was expanded to coastal locations during the 1970s in the wake of Camille based upon recommendations made by the Department of Commerce in September 1969.

The devastation of Camille inspired the implementation of the Saffir–Simpson scale. After the storm, many Gulf Coast residents commented that hurricane warnings were not clear enough in conveying the expected intensity of the coming storm. The Saffir–Simpson scale offered a much more concise statement of storm intensity than barometric pressure and wind-speed measurements, and veterans of previous hurricanes could analogize the power of the approaching storm to those they had experienced.

In a 1999 report on Hurricane Camille sponsored by the NOAA Coastal Services Center, the authors concluded: &quot;With Camille, the preparations for the event and the response were based on processes put in place long before the storm made landfall. Coordination between government agencies as well as with state and local officials was enhanced because of preexisting plans.&quot;

Due to the high death toll and major destruction in much of the Southern United States, the name &quot;Camille&quot; was retired after the 1969 season, and will never again be used for an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone. The name &quot;Cindy&quot; was selected to replace &quot;Camille&quot; in 1973. However, the 4year lists were replaced in 1971 by a new series of lists running though 1980.

===Records===
Camille produced the sixth lowest official sea level pressure ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, at . This was also its landfalling pressure; the only hurricane to hit the United States with a lower pressure at landfall was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. A reconnaissance flight indicated a pressure of , but this pressure was later corrected in 1969 by researchers to . The wind speed of Camille can only be approximated, as no meteorological equipment survived the extreme conditions at landfall, but Camille is estimated to have had sustained winds of at landfall, with gusts exceeding , although a reanalysis in April 2014 concluded that Camille had maximum winds of rather than the 190 mph reading used previously. Before Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Camille likely had the highest storm surge measured in the United States, at over .
==Comparisons to Hurricane Katrina==

Although Hurricane Camille and Hurricane Katrina took different paths, both reached the same section of the coast of Mississippi with similar destructive effects. Camille intensified more rapidly than Katrina, and unlike Katrina, Camille re-intensified a second time and maintained status as a Category 5 hurricane until landfall. Both hurricanes shared the common aspect of undergoing periods of rapid intensification. The size of Camille&#x27;s radius of maximum wind was less than one-third that of Katrina, more similar to the intense but small Hurricane Andrew. Also unlike Katrina, Camille caused little damage in New Orleans, Louisiana, though Camille itself just barely missed the city. The area of hurricane-force winds within Camille was just over two-thirds the size of Hurricane Katrina. Both storms were moving at a similar forward motion at the time of landfall. Although Camille&#x27;s wind speed at landfall was higher, Katrina&#x27;s storm surge exceeded Camille&#x27;s storm surge at all known locations due to its greater size. Both hurricanes&#x27; names were retired.

==Naming background==
In the 1960s, there were four lists of feminine given names used for Atlantic hurricanes, with each list being used every fourth year. The practice of retiring hurricane names was meant to be temporary, with the guideline that a name be retired for ten years. When the name Carla was retired in 1961, it was replaced on the 1965 list with Carol, a name retired in 1954 when its namesake devastated New England. Since over a decade had passed, Carol was eligible for reuse. Carol entered the 1969 list, but scientists from the National Hurricane Research Laboratory (NHRL) asked the naming committee in January 1969 to permanently retire Carol, Edna, and Hazel since papers were still being written about the storms. The committee agreed but needed a replacement &quot;C&quot; name. John Hope&#x27;s daughter Camille was involved in an advanced science and math program in high school and had carried out a required independent research project. John Hope asked Banner Miller to mentor her in her investigation of hurricanes and long-term atmospheric trends. Miller was impressed by her project and suggested her name for the list. &quot;We kept it quiet for many years,&quot; Camille said in a circa 2014 interview.

==In popular culture==

===Films ===
* &quot;A Lady Called Camille&quot; (1971), created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture shortly after the hurricane, shows preparation and recovery efforts organized largely by Wade Guice, the former Harrison County Civil Defense Director whose wife, Julia, served as Biloxi Civil Defense Director at the time. The couple are seen at their posts at the outset of the film. The film also contains brief footage of the ill-fated Richilieu Apartments after the hurricane, where a Civil Defense worker had attempted to persuade residents to evacuate. The film is accessible in the Internet Archive FedFlix collection.
* &quot;Hurricane&quot;, a 1974 ABC made-for-TV disaster movie starring Frank Sutton and Larry Hagman. It contained references to the Richilieu Apartments and the Hurricane Hunter plane that flew into the eye of Camille and lost an engine, along with news footage from the hurricane.

===Music===
* Jazz Banjo player Béla Fleck wrote a jazz fusion song &quot;Hurricane Camille&quot; on his album &quot;Béla Fleck and the Flecktones&quot; (1991).

===Publications===
* Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Without Remorse&quot; (1993) opens with the demolition of an oil rig damaged during Camille.
* Camille has an important role in the plot of John Grisham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Boys from Biloxi&quot;. The book&#x27;s protagonist begins his career a lawyer when persistently suing insurance companies which try to avoid paying for homes destroyed by Camille. Having established his reputation in this way, he eventually gets elected as District Attorney - leading to his head-on confrontation with organized crime which is the novel&#x27;s main theme.

===Stage productions===
* Beth Henley&#x27;s play &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; (1979) takes place in Hazlehurst, Mississippi and is set five years after Hurricane Camille. While the hurricane is rarely mentioned in the script, it is cited as the cause of Doc Porter&#x27;s limp and the reason Meg Magrath has been shunned by most of the town. The play was originally produced by the Actors Theatre of Louisville, Inc. in February 1979 and received its New York premiere at the Manhattan Theatre Club in 1980.
* In 2008, Lynchburg, Virginia-based Endstation Theatre Company (then based in Amherst, Virginia) premiered an original play, &quot;The Bluest Water: A Hurricane Camille Story&quot; (by playwright Jason Chimonides), as part of its inaugural Blue Ridge Summer Theatre Festival on the campus of Sweet Briar College. While the play was partly historical fiction (featuring contrived characters experiencing or remembering the actual events of Hurricane Camille), many characters&#x27; stories or lines of dialogue were composites of true accounts or testimonials from Nelson County (most notably Massies Mill, the Tye River, and Davis Creek) and the surrounding areas. The play was revived in the festival&#x27;s second year (2009), in conjunction with the Nelson County Historical Society&#x27;s observation of the 40th anniversary of Camille.

===Television===
* In the October 2, 1991, episode of the NBC series &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, titled &quot;Hurricane&quot; (Season 4, Episode 3), the main character, Sam Beckett, leaps into Archie Necaise, a small-town sheriff in the middle of Hurricane Camille. He must keep his host&#x27;s girlfriend from being killed in the storm.
* In the 1978 documentary series &quot;When Havoc Struck&quot; presented by Glenn Ford, one episode was titled &#x27;Hurricane Camille&#x27;.

<text>Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists are part of a larger sub-group of Baptists that is commonly referred to as &quot;anti-mission&quot; Baptists. This sub-group includes the Duck River and Kindred Baptists, Old Regular Baptists, some Regular Baptists and some United Baptists. Only a minuscule minority of Primitive Baptists adhere to the Two-Seed doctrine. The primary centers of Two-Seedism were in Northern Alabama, Arkansas, Eastern Tennessee, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. As of 2002, five churches or congregations of this faith and order still existed in Alabama, Indiana, Tennessee, and Texas.

==Origins==

Baptists first appeared in North America in the early 17th century. Through the influence of the Philadelphia Baptist Association (org. 1707), the influx of members to the churches from the Great Awakenings, and the union of the disparate Regular and Separate Baptists, by the early 19th century Baptists would become an important American denomination. This growth was not without its pangs, and by 1820 these Baptists were embroiled in an intense and sometimes bitter &quot;missions&quot; controversy. Much of the controversy centered around the newly formed Baptist Board of Foreign Missions.

Elder Daniel Parker (1781–1844) was one of the earlier ministers to speak out against the &quot;missions&quot; movement. In 1820, he released a booklet entitled &quot;&quot;A Public Address to the Baptist Society, and Friends of Religion in General, on the Principle and Practice of the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions for the United States of America&quot;.&quot; The Baptist Board of Foreign Missions, organized at Philadelphia in 1814, is best known as the &quot;Triennial Convention&quot;, but its official name was the &quot;General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States.&quot; Objections by Baptists to the Convention were based on both soteriology and ecclesiology. Parker was a strict predestinarian, but his chief objections in the booklet are based on ecclesiology - for example, &quot;They have violated the right or government of the Church of Christ in forming themselves into a body and acting without of the union.&quot; Several important preachers on the east coast led in the &quot;anti-missions&quot; movement, but Elder Parker was the leader on the frontier, and probably spoke best to the common man.

It appears that during this time, Parker was also formulating views on God and man that he would first release in his &quot;Views on the Two Seeds&quot; (1826). Parker taught that all persons are either of the &quot;good seed&quot; of God or of the &quot;bad seed&quot; of Satan (the children of the good seed are roughly equivalent to the &quot;elect&quot; of Calvinism, and those of the bad seed similar to the &quot;non-elect&quot;), and were predestined that way from the beginning. Therefore mission activity was not only unbiblical, but as a practical matter useless, since the &quot;decision&quot; was already made prior to birth.

It seems that Parker spread his &quot;two seeds&quot; far and wide, and a goodly number of the &quot;anti-missions&quot; movement accepted his doctrine, though it never achieved anything near majority status. In 1834, Daniel Parker and others migrated to the Texas frontier. Texas was still part of Mexico and the government would not allow organization of Protestant (non-Catholic) churches in the region. Elder Parker determined to organize a church before he arrived in Texas. The &quot;Pilgrim Predestinarian Regular Baptist Church&quot; was constituted July 26, 1833 in Illinois. It still exists today, near Elkhart, Texas, though as &quot;Primitive&quot; rather than &quot;Two-Seed.&quot; Daniel Parker&#x27;s name is almost synonymous with &quot;anti-missions&quot;, but he was one of the important frontier preachers in Texas, leading in the organization of about nine churches in the eastern part of the state.

After the &quot;missionary&quot; and &quot;anti-missionary&quot; controversy brought division among Baptists, the &quot;anti-missionaries&quot; were called by names such as Old School, Old Regular, Predestinarian, and Primitive (as well as the pejorative &quot;hardshells&quot;). The Two-Seed churches were often connected with the Primitive Baptists and seem to have been so until late in the 19th century. By that time, most Primitive Baptists had excluded the &quot;Two-Seeders&quot; for holding heretical doctrines. However, in southern Georgia, at least, according to historian John G. Crowley, one may still find Two-Seed doctrines expounded by Primitive Baptists &quot;if one knows where to go and what to listen for.&quot; Though they hold much in common with Primitive Baptists and often are so identified by outsiders, the Two-Seed churches do not consider themselves Primitive Baptists.

==Following Parker&#x27;s death==
The Two-Seed theological stance is known in some circles as Hyper-Calvinism, i.e., only evangelize to those who can be discerned as being members of the elect. This group is extremely conservative. As one observer noted, &quot;&#x27;Innovations&#x27; have never touched these people.&quot; In 1845, shortly after Parker&#x27;s death, this group experienced its first major schism. Central Kentucky&#x27;s Elder Thomas P. Dudley, a member of a church of the Licking Creek Association, produced a work on &quot;Two Souls&quot; to supplement Parker&#x27;s on the two seeds.

Baptism is by immersion. The only other ordinance this group practices is the Lord&#x27;s Supper with foot washing. One commentator stated that this group was &quot;so Calvinistic that they would exclude John Calvin himself.&quot;

The 1906 Census of Religious Bodies, there were nineteen churches in Tennessee, ten in Arkansas, nine in Kentucky, five in Georgia, four in Indiana, three in Florida, two each in Alabama and Texas, and one in Missouri with a total membership of 781. The Bear Creek, Bethlehem, Caney Fork, Drakes Creek, Elm Fork, Lookout Mountain, Pilgrims Rest, Richland Creek, and Suwannee River associations were affiliated with this movement. The New Hope Predestinarian Baptist Association of Illinois existed in 1877, but, was evidently extinct by 1906.

In 1936, this body reported two churches in urban settings and fourteen in rural areas. The membership stood at 201. One of the urban churches (in Alabama) had 57 members and was certainly the largest single congregation. Local churches existed in Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Previously churches existed in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, and Missouri. Three associations were also enumerated: Caney Fork, Drakes Creek, and Richland Creek. In 1916, there had been nine associations. For some reason, the congregations in Texas and Indiana are not included in the 1936 report (they were still in existence) although they had been listed in 1906 and 1916. Likewise, the Eel River Association, which folded in 1941, is omitted. Therefore, the figure of 201 adherents in 1936 is lower than it should have been.

==Current==
Remnants of Two-Seed doctrine can still be heard among a few Primitive Baptists. In 2003, there appeared to be four remaining churches of the &quot;Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists (&quot;two in Texas, and one each in Indiana and Tennessee) with approximately 80 members. Two of the churches participate together in the &quot;Trinity River Association&quot;, and two are independent.

Baptist historian Albert W. Wardin Jr. reported the following statistics in an article published in the June 22, 2002, issue of &quot;Baptist History and Heritage&quot;:

In 2011, Valdosta State University announced that Dr. John G. Crowley, an assistant professor of history there, was writing the first comprehensive history of the Two-Seed movement

==Cultural references==
In his 1945 supplement to &quot;The American Language&quot;, H. L. Mencken singled out the Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptist Church as an example of the proliferation of &quot;dissenting&quot; Christian denominations in the United States.

American novelist Kurt Vonnegut Jr. refers to the sect in his early novel &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; (1965), when the title character claims that he is a member.

<text>The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), located on the campus of Michigan State University was a rare isotope research facility in the United States. Established in 1963, the cyclotron laboratory has been succeeded by the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, a linear accelerator providing beam to the same detector halls.

NSCL was the nation&#x27;s largest nuclear science facility on a university campus.
Funded primarily by the National Science Foundation and MSU, the NSCL operated two superconducting cyclotrons. The lab&#x27;s scientists investigated the properties of rare isotopes and nuclear reactions. In nature, these reactions would take place in stars and exploding stellar environments such as novae and supernovae. The K1200 cyclotron was the highest-energy continuous beam accelerator in the world (as compared to synchrotrons such as the Large Hadron Collider which provide beam in &quot;cycles&quot;).

The laboratory&#x27;s primary goal was to understand the properties of atomic nuclei. Atomic nuclei are ten thousand times smaller than the atoms they reside in, but they contain nearly all the atom&#x27;s mass (more than 99.9 percent).
Most of the atomic nuclei found on earth are stable, but there are many unstable and rare isotopes that exist in the universe, sometimes only for a fleeting moment in conditions of high pressure or temperature. The NSCL made and studied atomic nuclei that could not be found on earth. Rare isotope research is essential for understanding how the elements—and ultimately the universe—were formed.

The nuclear physics graduate program at MSU was ranked best in America by the 2018 Best Grad Schools index published by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Laboratory upgrades==

The upgrade plans are in close alignment with a report issued December 2006 by the National Academies, &quot;Scientific Opportunities with a Rare-Isotope Facility in the United States&quot;, which defines a scientific agenda for a U.S.-based rare-isotope facility and addresses the need for such a facility in context of international efforts in this area. NSCL is working towards a significant capability upgrade that will keep the laboratory – and nuclear science – at the cutting edge well into the 21st century.

The upgrade of NSCL – the $750 million Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), under construction as of 2020 – will boost intensities and varieties of rare isotope beams produced at MSU by replacing the K500 and K1200 cyclotrons with a powerful linear accelerator to be built beneath the ground. Such beams will allow researchers and students to continue to address a host of questions at the intellectual frontier of nuclear science: How does the behavior of novel and short-lived nuclei differ from more stable nuclei? What is the nature of nuclear processes in explosive stellar environments? What is the structure of hot nuclear matter at abnormal densities?

Beyond basic research, FRIB may lead to cross-disciplinary benefits. Experiments there will help astronomers better interpret data from ground- and space-based observatories. Scientists at the Isotope Science Facility will contribute to research on self-organization and complexity arising from elementary interactions, a topic relevant to the life sciences and quantum computing. Additionally, the facility&#x27;s capabilities may lead to advances in fields as diverse as biomedicine, materials science, national and international security, and nuclear energy.

==Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics==
The Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA) is a collaboration between Michigan State University, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Chicago to address a broad range of experimental, theoretical, and observational questions in nuclear astrophysics. A portion of the Michigan State collaboration is housed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, directly involving roughly 30 nuclear physicists and astrophysicists.

<text>Chaudhuriidae, is a family of small freshwater eel-like fish related to the swamp eels and spiny eels, commonly known as the earthworm eels. The known species are literally the size and shape of earthworms, thus the family name. While one species, &quot;Chaudhuria caudata&quot; was reported from the Inle Lake by Nelson Annandale in 1918, the others have been only recently reported (since the 1970s), all in the eastern Asia area, from India to Korea.

Neither the dorsal nor anal fins have spines, and in &quot;Nagaichthys&quot; and &quot;Pillaia&quot; they have fused with the caudal fin; in the other genera, the caudal is small but separate. Their bodies have no scales. The few specimens found to date have been no longer than 8 cm, and &quot;Nagaichthys filipes&quot; is only known to reach 3.1 cm. The eyes are small, covered in thick skin. Almost nothing is known of the habits and biology of the earthworm eels.

The family name &quot;Chaudhuriidae&quot; comes from a Burmese local name for a fish.

<doc id="326002" wikidata="Q382423" url="?curid=326002" title="Raoul Cédras">
<text>Joseph Raoul Cédras (born July 9, 1949) is a Haitian former military officer who was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Haiti from 1991 to 1994. Cedras was the last military ruler of Haiti.

==Background==
A mulatto, Cédras was educated in the United States at the School of the Americas and was a member of the U.S.-trained &quot;Leopard&quot; Corps. He also trained with the Spanish military. Cédras was chosen by the US and France to be in charge of security for the 1990–91 Haitian general election, and subsequently named Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces by Jean-Bertrand Aristide in early 1991. Under Aristide, Cédras &quot;was one important source for the CIA, providing reports critical of President Aristide.&quot;

==De facto leader of Haiti (1991–1994)==
Cédras, Lieutenant General in the Forces Armées d&#x27;Haïti (FAdH; the Armed Forces of Haiti) at the time, was responsible for the 1991 Haitian coup d&#x27;état which ousted President Aristide on 29 September 1991.

Some human rights groups criticized Cédras&#x27;s rule, alleging that innocent people were killed by the FAdH military and FRAPH paramilitary units. The US State Department said in 1995 that in the three years following the coup &quot;international observers estimated that more than 3,000 men, women and children were murdered by or with the complicity of Haiti&#x27;s then-coup regime.&quot;

While remaining the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Haiti as commander of the country&#x27;s armed forces, Cédras did not retain his position as head of state, preferring to have other politicians as official presidents. As required by Article 149 of the 1987 Haitian Constitution, Haiti&#x27;s Parliament appointed Supreme Court Justice Joseph Nérette as provisional President, to fill in until elections could be held. The elections were planned for December 1991, but Nérette resigned and was replaced undemocratically by Supreme Court Justice Émile Jonassaint.

Under the delegation of U.S. president Bill Clinton, the former US president Jimmy Carter, accompanied by Sam Nunn and Colin Powell, urged Provisional President Émile Jonassaint to relinquish his control in 1994, in order to avoid a potential invasion. Jonassaint resigned. Cédras had indicated his desire to remain in Haiti. However, the Americans did not think this was the best solution and convinced the General that in the national interest, he should consider departing for Panama. The United States reportedly gave Cédras $1 million and rented three properties as incentive to leave power.

==Later life==
After leaving Haiti, Cédras went to Panama, where he remains. Aristide returned to power in Haiti in 1994, was re-elected to the presidency in 2000, and was forced into resigning again in a 2004 coup.

<doc id="326003" wikidata="Q16611" url="?curid=326003" title="Flag of Russia">
<text>The national flag of the Russian Federation (, ) is a tricolour of three equal horizontal bands: white on the top, blue in the middle, and red on the bottom.

The design was first introduced by Tsar Peter the Great in 1693, and in 1705 it was adopted as the civil ensign of the Tsardom of Russia; the flag continued to be used as a civil ensign under the Russian Empire. In 1858, Emperor Alexander II declared the black-yellow-white tricolour as the national flag, and in 1896 it was replaced by the white-blue-red tricolour by Nicholas II. In 1917, following the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks banned the tricolour, though it continued to be flown by the White movement during the Russian Civil War. The flag of the Russian SFSR was a red field with its Cyrillic acronym &quot;РСФСР&quot; in the upper-left corner, and after 1954, was a red field with a vertical blue stripe on the left and a gold hammer and sickle.

Shortly after the August Coup in 1991, the Russian SFSR adopted the imperial tricolour as the national flag of Russia, although with slightly different dimensions and colour shades than the current version. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of year, the newly independent Russian Federation inherited the redesigned flag, and its current proportions and shades were specified by President Boris Yeltsin in 1993.

== Origin ==
Two accounts of the flag&#x27;s origin connect it to the tricolour used by the Dutch Republic (the Statenvlag, later the flag of the Netherlands).

The earliest mention of the flag occurs during the reign of Alexis I, in 1668, and is related to the construction of the first Russian naval ship, the frigate &quot;Oryol&quot;. According to one source, the ship&#x27;s Dutch lead engineer Butler faced the need for the flag, and issued a request to the Boyar Duma, to &quot;ask His Royal Majesty as to which (as is the custom among other nations) flag shall be raised on the ship&quot;. The official response merely indicated that, as such issue is as yet unprecedented, even though the land forces do use (apparently different) flags, the tsar ordered that his (Butler&#x27;s) opinion be sought about the matter, asking specifically as to the custom existing in his country.

A different account traces the origins of the Russian flag to tsar Peter the Great&#x27;s visits to Arkhangelsk in 1693 and 1694. Peter was keenly interested in shipbuilding in the European style, different from the barges ordinarily used in Russia at the time. In 1693, Peter had ordered a Dutch-built frigate from Amsterdam. In 1694 when it arrived, the Dutch red, white, and blue banner flew from its stern. Peter decided to model Russia&#x27;s naval flag after that banner by assigning meaning and reordering the colours.

The Dutch flag book of 1695 by Carel Allard, printed only a year after Peter&#x27;s trip to Western Europe, describes the tricolour with a double-headed eagle bearing a shield on its breast and wearing a golden crown over both of its heads.

== History ==

A study on clarifying the national colours of Russia based on disquisition on documents of the Moscow Archive of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Empire was summarized by Dmitry Samokvasov, a Russian archaeologist and legal historian, in an edition of 16 pages called &quot;On the Question of National Colours of Ancient Russia&quot; published in Moscow in 1910.

===1552–1918: Tsardom, Empire and Republic===

In 1552, Russian regiments marched on the victorious assault of Kazan under Ivan the Terrible with the banner of the Most Gracious Saviour. For the next century and a half, the banner of Ivan the Terrible accompanied the Russian army. Under Tsarina Sophia Alekseevna, it visited the Crimean campaigns, and under Peter the Great, the Azov campaigns and the Russo-Swedish War.

In the Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible, there is an image of the banner of Ivan the Terrible in the Kazan campaign – a bifurcated white one with the image of the Saviour and an eight-pointed cross above it. According to other sources, the banner was red instead of white. A copy of this banner, which has been restored many times, is still kept in the Kremlin Armoury.

In 1612, the Nizhny Novgorod militia raised the banner of Dmitry Pozharsky, it was crimson in colour with the image of the Lord Almighty on one side and the archangel Michael on the other.
In 1669, the Polish painters Stanislav Loputsky and Ivan Mirovsky invited by Tsar Alexis of Russia, painted for the tsar&#x27;s palace in Kolomenskoye &quot;the hallmarks (that is, the emblems) of the sovereigns and all the universal states of this world.&quot; Then Loputsky drew &quot;on the canvas, the coat of arms of the Moscow State and the arms of other neighbouring countries, under every emblem of the planet under which they are.&quot; The coat of arms was a white rectangular banner with a &quot;slope&quot; and a wide red border, in the centre of which was depicted a gold two-headed eagle and the emblems symbolizing the subject kingdoms, principalities and lands. In the inventory of the Kremlin Armoury, the coat of arms is described as the following: &quot;In the circle there is a two-headed eagle wearing two crowns, and in his chest, the king on horseback pricks a serpent with his spear&quot;.

On 6 August 1693, during Peter the Great&#x27;s sailing in the White Sea with a detachment of warships built in Arkhangelsk, the so-called &quot;Flag of the Tsar of Muscovy&quot; was raised for the first time on the 12-gun yacht &quot;Saint Peter&quot;. The flag was a cross-stitch of 4.6x4.9 meters sewn from cloth, composed of three equal-sized horizontal stripes of white, blue and red, with a golden double-headed eagle in the middle. The original of this oldest surviving Russian flag is located in the Central Naval Museum in Saint Petersburg.

A 1695 flag book by Carel Allard describes three flags used by the tsar of Muscovy: the tricolour with the double-headed eagle bearing a shield on its breast and wearing a golden crown over both of its heads, the same tricolour with a blue saltire over it, and a cross flag showing red and white quartering with a blue cross over all. The cross flag is depicted upon the Construction of Kronschloss Medal, which commemorates the construction of Fort Kronschlot (Kronschloss) in Kronstadt by Peter the Great in 1704, the colours of the flag being determined according to the hatchings engraved.

The armorial banner of Peter the Great was created in 1696. Made from red taffeta with a white border, the flag depicted a golden eagle hovering over the sea. On the chest of the eagle in the circle is the Saviour, next to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. The banner was likely made for the second Azov campaign.
In 1693, Franz Timmerman received the order to build merchant ships in Arkhangelsk and trade with Europe. He was told to display the two-headed eagle spread with wings, with three crowns over it. On the chest of the eagle, a warrior on horseback was to be displayed with a spear, in a military harness. The same eagle was also to hold a sceptre with the right leg and an apple with a crest with the left. The same instructions were given to other traders.

According to Dutch newspapers, in June 1694, a 44-gun frigate bought by Russia and built in Rotterdam stood in the Amsterdam roadstead under the white-blue-red flag.

In 1696, at the mouth of the river Don, a Russian flotilla of armed rowboats blocked the supply of the Ottoman fortress of Azov. On the 1700 engraving by Adrian Shkhonebek, &quot;Taking the fortress of Azov. 1696&quot;, depicts the ships carrying rectangular panels on the flagpoles, the heraldic shading of which shows that some of the flags are blue with a straight red cross, and the rest are white with a straight red cross. A number of researchers doubt the accuracy of Shkonebek&#x27;s engraving because he was not a witness to the events.

Images of various white-blue-red Russian flags are present in the three later paintings of Abraham Storck&#x27;s workshop dedicated to the arrival in Amsterdam of Peter I. Peter I took part in a practice battle on the river IJ while on board the yacht of the Dutch East India Company. In the paintings of Abraham Stork depicting the show fight, this yacht sails under the white-blue-red flag with a double-headed eagle, or under a white-red-blue pennant and a white-red-blue aft flag with a double-headed eagle.

In October 1699, Peter the Great, on the back of the sheet with instructions sent to the Russian envoy Yemelyan Ukraintsev in Istanbul, drew a sketch of a three-band white-blue-red flag.

In December 1699, the Austrian ambassador Anton Paleyer gave a list of weapons and flags seen on the vessels of the Azov Flotilla in a letter. He described seeing three small flags of white-red-blue colours and two regimental colours of red and white mixed in with other colours.

In April 1700, Peter the Great ordered the Kremlin Armoury to build white-red-violet sea banners. The design and dimensions of these banners correspond to the figure and the size of the regimental banner kept among the other 352 trophy Russian banners in the burial vault of Swedish kings – the Riddarholm Church in Stockholm.

The three-band white-blue-red flag, as well as the flag with a red Jerusalem cross, were also used on warships up to 1720 as signals.

The Russian tricolour flag was adopted as a merchant flag at rivers in 1705. These colours of the flag of Russia would later inspire the choice of the &quot;Pan-Slavic colours&quot; by the Prague Slavic Congress, 1848. Two other Slavic countries, Slovakia and Slovenia, have flags similar to the Russian one, but with added coats-of-arms for differentiation. On 7 May 1883, the Russian flag was authorized to be used on land, and it became an official &quot;National flag&quot; before the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II in 1896. 

The flag continued to be used by the Russian Provisional Government after Tsar Nicholas II abdicated during the February Revolution and was not replaced until the October Revolution which established the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.

===1918–1991: Civil War and Soviet Union (USSR)===


On 8 April 1918, the flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was discussed at a meeting of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the RSFSR. The Council proposed that the All-Russian Central Executive Committee create a red flag with the abbreviation for the phrase &quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot; However, the proposal was not adopted. On 13 April 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee established the RSFSR flag to be a red banner with the inscription &quot;Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic&quot;. The text of the decree did not contain any clarification regarding the colour, size and location of the inscription, or the width and length ratio of the cloth.

On 17 June 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee approved a sample image of the flag of the RSFSR, developed on behalf of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR by the graphic artist Sergey Chekhonin. The flag was a red rectangular panel, in the upper corner of which was placed the inscription &quot;RSFSR&quot; in gold letters stylized as Slavic. This inscription was separated from the rest of the cloth on both sides by gold stripes forming a rectangle.

On 30 December 1922, the RSFSR combined with the Ukrainian SSR, Byelorussian SSR, and Transcaucasian SFSR to form the Soviet Union. The national flag of the USSR was established on 18 April 1924, described in the Constitution of the USSR as a red or scarlet rectangular cloth with a 1:2 width to length ratio, with a gold sickle and hammer in the top corner next to the flagpole and a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. This flag was carried by all ships of the USSR and diplomatic representations of the USSR. The 1:2 red flag was used, until replaced in 1954 with the universal design of the Soviet flag with a blue stripe along the mast.

Contrary to the belief that the USSR state flag outranked the flag of the RSFSR, the actual use of the USSR flag was limited. The USSR flag in Russia flew only over two buildings, that of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. That decision was adopted on 23 March 1925, also establishing that the flag of the RSFSR had to be raised constantly not only on the buildings of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars but also on the buildings of all local soviets, including village soviets and district soviets in cities. On holidays, the RSFSR flag had to be raised on many public buildings (such as schools, hospitals, and government offices).
During the Second World War, the white-blue-red tricolour was used by German collaborators, most of whom were from groups targeted by the repressions of the Stalin era, including anti-communist Christians and the remnants of the Kulaks, who generally regarded the German invasion as a liberation of Russia from communism. The Russian Liberation Army under the leadership of Andrey Vlasov used the tricolour during a military flag.

On 20 January 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR found it necessary to amend the national flags of the allied republics so that the flags reflected the idea of a Soviet Union state as well as the unique national identities of the republics. On each of the flags was placed the emblem of the USSR, a sickle and a hammer with a red five-pointed star, with the inclusion of national ornaments and new colours. The new RSFSR flag was established in January 1954: a red rectangular panel with a light blue strip near the pole running the full width of the flag. In the upper left corner of the red canvas were depicted a golden sickle and a hammer and above them a red five-pointed star framed with a golden border. By the Law of the RSFSR of 2 June 1954, this flag was approved and the description of the flag was included in Article 149 of the Constitution of the RSFSR.

===1991–present: Russian Federation===

During the dissolution of the Soviet Union, after the 1991 August Coup, the Russian SFSR adopted a new flag design similar to the pre-revolutionary tricolour that had been abolished in 1917. The ratio of the new flag was 1:2, and the flag colours consisted of white on the top, blue in the middle, and red on the bottom. The flag design remained the same until 1993, when the original Russian tricolour was fully restored as the current flag after the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. Following the events of the attempted coup in Moscow, the supreme soviet of the Russian SFSR declared, by resolution dated 22 August 1991, that the old imperial tricolour flag serve as the national flag of the state. The constitution was subsequently amended by Law No. 1827-1 1 November 1991. At the disintegration of the USSR on 25 December 1991, the Soviet flag was lowered from Kremlin and then replaced by the tricolor flag. 

The modern era flag underwent a proportion change from 1:2 to 2:3 in 1993 and has been most recently provided for by a 2000 law. On 11 December 1993, President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin signed Decree No. 2126 &quot;On the State Flag of the Russian Federation&quot;. In Article 1 of the decree, the flag was described as a &quot;rectangular panel of three equal horizontal stripes: the top – white, middle – blue, and bottom – red, with a width to length ratio of 2:3.&quot; The pre-1993 flag is still depicted on Russian license plates, as the design specifications were finalized and published 6 months prior to Yeltsin&#x27;s decree.

The National Flag Day is an official holiday in Russia, established in 1994. It is celebrated on 22 August, the day of the victory over putschists in 1991, but employees remain at work.

== Symbolism ==
At the times of Alexander III of Russia the official interpretation was as follows: the white colour symbolizes nobility and frankness; the blue for faithfulness, honesty, impeccability, and chastity; and the red for courage, generosity, and love. A common unofficial interpretation was: Red: Great Russia, White: White Russia, Blue: Little Russia.

== Regulations ==
When the Russian flag and the flags of the Russian federal subjects are flown at the same time, the national flag should be:

* on the left if two flags are raised
* in the middle if the number of flags is odd
* and to the left of the centre if the number is even

The flag cannot be smaller, or lower than a regional flag.

== Colour specifications ==

Federal constitutional law of the Russian Federation only says that the colours of the flag are &quot;white&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; (синий, or dark blue, as Russian has two colours that are called &quot;blue&quot; in English), and &quot;red&quot;. The Federal Constitutional Law on the State Flag of the Russian Federation does not actually specify which shades the colours should be. Russian government agencies when ordering the manufacture of cloth for the flag indicate the following Pantone colours: white, blue (Pantone 286C), and red (Pantone 485C).

The album of national flags, published by the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Navy (France), gives the following shades of colours of the flag of Russia in Pantone:
==Variant versions==

A variant of the flag was authorized for private use by Tsar Nicholas II before World War I, adding the large state eagle on a yellow field (imperial standard) in the canton. It has never been used as the official state flag. Likewise, today some Russian people may use another variant of the flag defaced with the coat of arms (in this case the double-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle and the golden word РОССИЯ at the bottom.

After the October Revolution of 1917, the tricolour design was banned, and a definitive new flag of the Russian SFSR was introduced in 1954 (see flag of the Russian SFSR), and this remained the republic&#x27;s flag until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. All of the Soviet republics&#x27; flags were created by introducing a small but noticeable change to the flag of the Soviet Union. For Russia, the change was an introduction of the left-hand blue band. The previous Soviet design was different, a plain red flag with different variants of the &quot;RSFSR&quot; abbreviation in the canton. Today, the Soviet flag is used by the supporters and members of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.

The tricolour was used by the anticommunist forces during the Civil War called the White movement. It was continued to be used by White émigrés in various countries as the Russian flag. The tricolour was associated both in Soviet Russia as well as the Russian White emigre communities as symbolizing a traditional tsarist Orthodox Russia. This flag can be seen inside a few Orthodox churches in the West established by the Russian communities. In the Soviet Union, the tricolour was used in films set in the pre-revolutionary period and was seen as a historical flag, especially after the 1940s.

It, rather than the black-yellow-white colour combination, was readopted by Russia on 22 August 1991. That date is celebrated yearly as the national flag day.

The Russian president uses a standard which was introduced via Presidential Decree No.319 on 15 February 1994, it is officially defined as the square tricolour with the coat of arms (in this case the double-headed eagle is depicted without the shield) in the middle.

<doc id="326009" wikidata="Q2655327" url="?curid=326009" title="Ashiko">
<text>The ashiko is a drum, shaped like a tapered cylinder or truncated cone with the head on the wide end, and the narrow end open. It is made of hardwood and generally has a calfskin hide. Nowadays, goatskin is sometimes used, in imitation of the high sound of the popular djembe drum. It is played with the hands, and tuned by ropes. Ashiko drums – or variants thereof – are traditionally found in West Africa, as well as part of the Americas.

==History==
The origins of the ashiko drum are traced to the Yoruba culture in (mainly) present-day Nigeria and Benin, West Africa. The word “ashiko” is also traced to a word in the Yoruba language meaning either “drum” or (with tonal difference) &quot;time-frame&quot; or “freedom”. The drum has a long tradition in Yoruba culture, where the drum functioned in community celebrations, as well as a “talking drum”. Traditional ashikos were/are hand carved from a single lug of wood and were not straight cones.

Perhaps because Yorubaland and surrounding areas were strongly involved in (affected by) the Atlantic slave trade, drums with similar forms and characteristics are historically found in Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Latin American cultures and traditions. In Cuba specifically,“ashiko-like” drums can be identified in the drum known as “bocú” in Eastern Cuba, as well as one of the drums (a solo drum) used in the Abakua secret society. 
Drums similarly shaped to the ashiko - including the &quot;truncated cone&quot; form - can also be found in Afro-Colombian music (the Tambor Alegre in the Caribbean region of Colombia), as well as in Afro-Brazilian music, such as the Timbau. The latter, from the Bahia region, tends to have however synthetic heads and is, unlike the ashiko, tuned by pegs.

The African/Nigerian ashiko as such first got disseminated and popularized in some circles in the US in the 1930s, after Nigerian drummer Moses Mianns emigrated to New York in the 1930s. The drum he commissioned in the United States is in the collections of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the NYPL. Examining it, one can see the original ashiko is not a simple cone drum but is, in fact, curved on the inside, creating a softer tone, and emulating carved drums.

The ashiko received exposure on a much wider scale in the US and elsewhere in the 1950s and 1960s with the popularity of the touring folkloric ensemble created by Yoruba musician Babatunde Olatunji, which included ashiko and other drums. His ensemble of Montego Joe, Chief James Hawthorne Bey, and Baba Taiwo DuVall, and Julito Collazo, were all students of Miannes who played with Olatunji, and disseminated the technique. They can be heard on Olatunji&#x27;s groundbreaking LP for Columbia, Drums of Passion. Famed djembefola Ladji Camara, who truly introduced the drum to U.S. students, worked with Olatunji. He can be heard on Olatunji&#x27;s More Drums of Passion.

After Olajuni opened for the Grateful Dead in the 1980s, the ashiko spread from its Afro-based constituency, and became part of the European-American growing local drum movement in the US and elsewhere in the Western world. Though it remains there, its popularity has dwindled to that of the djembe, conga, or bongos drums.

==Characteristics==
Some call the ashiko a &quot;male&quot; counterpart to the djembe, though this is contradicted by references to the relatively matriarchal Yoruba culture. Also it being regarded as &quot;between a djembe and a conga&quot; is seen as wrong, and disrespectful to the ashiko itself and its own tradition, including a distinct playing technique, different from the djembe or conga. A video example can be seen here: Traditional Ashiko Drum Playing Technique. The ashiko is a drum with its own history and is not a counterpart or derivative. There is, besides this, a geographical difference, as the djembe&#x27;s origins are associated with the Mali empire (Guinee and Mali region), and the ashiko&#x27;s as said with Yorubaland.

Superficial sonic similarities with the djembe relate to the goatskin head it has in common with it, but the longer, cylinder form of the ashiko drum makes the bass tone “deeper” than that of the bowl-shaped djembe, while in general the sounds – most speak of three different tones of the ashiko – are different (a bit softer) when compared to the djembe. That is especially true of one uses traditional technique to play the drum. Some percussionists argue that the ashiko knows more &quot;middle tones&quot; when compared to the djembe.

Modern ashiko drums produced in the West are often made of vertical staves. Like other drums they can be purchased with the standard 8, 10, or 12 inch diameters of the hides. Ashikos tuned by lugs and metal tacks are nowadays also produced. Some manufacturers use cow hide; some assume to make the ashiko resemble an Afro-Cuban conga. This is, in fact, the &quot;old school&quot; method.

<doc id="326010" wikidata="Q1488259" url="?curid=326010" title="Gabelle">
<text>The gabelle () was a very unpopular French salt tax that was established during the mid-14th century and lasted, with brief lapses and revisions, until 1946. The term &quot;gabelle&quot; is derived from the Italian &quot;gabella&quot; (a duty), itself originating from the Arabic word (, &quot;he received&quot;).

In France, the &quot;gabelle&quot; was originally an indirect tax that was applied to agricultural and industrial commodities, such as bed sheets, wheat, spices, and wine. From the 14th century onward, the &quot;gabelle&quot; was limited and solely referred to the French crown&#x27;s taxation of salt.

Because the &quot;gabelle&quot; affected all French citizens (for use in cooking, for preserving food, for making cheese, and for raising livestock) and propagated extreme regional disparities in salt prices, the salt tax stood as one of the most hated and grossly unequal forms of revenue generation in the country&#x27;s history. Repealed in 1790 by the National Assembly in the midst of the French Revolution, the &quot;gabelle&quot; was reinstated by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806. It was briefly terminated and reinstated again during the French Second Republic and ultimately abolished in 1945 following France&#x27;s liberation from Nazi Germany.

==Introduction==
In 1229, when the Albigensian Crusades were brought to a close by King Louis IX and his mother (Blanche of Castile), France gained control of the Rhône Estuary and nearby Mediterranean coast. This led to the establishment of the first French Mediterranean port city, Aigues-Mortes (&quot;dead waters&quot;), in 1246. Here, salt-evaporation ponds and storehouses were constructed. These saltworks were intended to finance Louis&#x27; crusading ambitions in the Middle East. The means by which this salt would enrich the royal treasury was through a special duty on salt producers, which became the origin of the &quot;gabelle&quot;. 

The temporary tax under St. Louis (as he became known) was extended in 1259 by his brother Charles I, further establishing royal control over salt, in this case over the Berre saltworks near Marseilles. This salt administration would eventually encompass Peccais, Aigues-Mortes, and the region of Camargue and come to be known as the &quot;Pays de petites gabelles&quot;. On 16 March 1341, King Philip VI established the first permanent royal tax on salt in France, known as the &quot;Pays de grandes gabelles&quot;.

Repressive as a state monopoly, it was made doubly so by the government obliging every individual above the age of eight years to buy weekly a minimum quantity of salt at a fixed price. Known as the &quot;Sel de devoir&quot;, translated to &quot;salt duty&quot;, citizens in the &quot;Pays de grandes gabelles&quot; region were forced to buy up to 7 kilograms (15lb) of salt per year. Furthermore, they were unable to use this salt for making salted products, which was considered illegal and could lead to charges of &quot;faux saunage&quot;, or salt fraud. Failing to adhere to this could lead to imprisonment and, if repeated, death.

Each province had a &quot;Greniers à sel&quot; (a salt granary) where all salt produced from that region had to be taken in order to be bought (at a fixed price) and sold (at an inflated price).

==Classification==
When first instituted, the &quot;gabelle&quot; was levied uniformly on all the provinces in France at a rate of 1.66% on the sale price. For the greater part of its history the prices varied and resulted in large disparities between the different provinces. There were six distinct groups of provinces, which were called &quot;pays&quot; (lit. &quot;countries&quot;; to be understood as an obsolete word for &quot;region&quot;), and classified as follows:
*the &quot;Pays de grandes gabelles&quot;; this region included the Parisian Basin and the oldest provinces of the kingdom: Île-de-France, Berry, Orléanais, Touraine, Anjou, Maine, Bourbonnais, Normandy, Bourgogne (except the southeastern third), Champagne (except the county of Rethel, which retained the lower tax granted earlier), Picardy (except the area of Boulonnais and the bishopric of Cambrai). The largest of the six regions, it had not only the highest salt prices but also a mandatory salt duty for all people over eight years of age. One-third of France&#x27;s population resided within this region, and paid two-thirds of all salt revenue, but only consumed one-fourth of all salt.
*the &quot;Pays de petites gabelles&quot;; this region included the provinces of Lyonnais, Provence, Roussillon, Languedoc, and Dauphiné, southeast Burgundy (the districts of Mâconnais, Bresse, Bugey, and Beaujolais), and southern Auvergne (the districts of Forez and Rouergue). This region covered southeastern France, including the Mediterranean coastline and the lower Rhône valley. The &quot;gabelle&quot; there was about half of the rate as in the &quot;pays de grandes gabelles&quot;. One-fifth of all France&#x27;s population resided within this region and paid one-fourth of royal salt revenue.
*the &quot;Pays de quart-bouillon&quot;; these provinces included Avranches, Coutances, Bayeux, and Pont l&#x27;Evêque. One-fourth of all salt produced in this region went to the royal granaries.
*the &quot;Pays de salines&quot;; these provinces included Franche-Comté, Lorraine, the Trois Evêches (Metz, Toul, and Verdun) and Alsace. Unlike in the petites and grandes regions, the laws enforced here allowed private merchants to engage in retail and wholesale salt distribution rather than complete oversight by state officials. As a result, this region&#x27;s salt prices were less affected by the &quot;gabelle&quot; and its people more content with its effects. People here consumed twice as much salt as the citizens of the &quot;Pays de grandes gabelles&quot;.
*the &quot;Pays rédimés&quot;; these provinces included Poitou, Limousin, Auvergne, Marche, Guyenne, Périgord, Bigorre, Pays de Foix, and Comminges. Following insurrections caused by tax measures in the early to middle 1500s, in this region, in 1549, an agreement was made that citizens there would pay a large lump sum to the king and be forever excused from salt taxes. Instead, they were only taxed at tolls when transporting salt.
*the &quot;Pays exempts&quot;; these free provinces included Brittany, Boulonnais, Calaisis, Hainault, Artois, Flanders, Cambrésis, the principalities of Sedan and Raucour, Nebouzan, Béarn, Soule, Lower Navarre, Labours, the region of Gex, Arles, the islands of Ré and Oleron and the parts of the Aunis and Poitou that were near the salines of the Atlantic. Before coming into the kingdom of France, all of the aforementioned regions made agreements with the crown that they would only do so if they were not under the jurisdiction of the &quot;gabelle&quot;.

==Smuggling==
Because all of the &quot;Pays&quot; had extreme disparities in tax rates and salt consumption, opportunities for smuggling were rife within France. In 1784, Jacques Necker, a French statesman of Swiss birth and finance minister of Louis XVI until the French Revolution, reported that a minot of salt, which was 49 kilograms (107.8 pounds) cost only 31 sous in Brittany, but 81 in Poitou, 591 in Anjou, and 611 in Berry.

The large differences in cost between various &quot;pays&quot; clearly show the reason behind the active smuggling of salt that took place in France until the &quot;gabelle&quot; was abolished. The obvious means of smuggling salt was to buy it in a region where it was cheap and to sell it illegally in regions where it was expensive, at a higher price, but still less than the legal price. Such smugglers were called &quot;faux-sauniers&quot;, from &quot;faux&quot; (&quot;false&quot;) and the root &quot;sau&quot;-, referring to salt. They were able to amass large fortunes and seen by French citizens as heroes against an arbitrary and oppressive tax of a common good necessary to life. In turn, the customs guards tasked with arresting the &quot;faux-sauniers&quot; were called &quot;gabelous&quot;, a term obviously derived from the &quot;gabelle&quot; they sought to uphold. They were despised by common folk as they were, without cause, able to search people and their homes to find illegal salt. The &quot;gabelous&quot; carried weapons and were known to grope women for pleasure under the false pretence of looking for salt. Women were often used to smuggle salt under their dresses and sometimes used false derrières known as &quot;faux culs&quot; (from Latin &quot;culus&quot; meaning the human fundament). By the end of the eighteenth century, female smuggling was so common in some areas, especially in the west, that more women were arrested than men. It has been estimated that between 1759 and 1788, out of the 4788 arrests in Laval, 2845 women and children were arrested, amounting to more than half.

Under the 1640 codification of &quot;gabelle&quot; law by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, participating in &quot;faux saunage&quot;, warranted a range of harsh punishments. Merely housing a &quot;faux-saunier&quot; could lead to imprisonment, fines, and, if repeated, death. &quot;Faux-sauniers&quot; could be sentenced to up to ten years on a galley if they were caught without weapons, and to death if caught while armed. Other forms of &quot;faux-saunage&quot; included sheepherders letting their flock drink from salty ponds, traders overly salting cod during transportation, and fishing at night (so that fisherman with great knowledge of waterways could not smuggle salt). French nobles, if caught buying contraband salt, would immediately lose their status of nobility following their first offense. In 1773, along the Loire River, which separated the regions of Brittany and Anjou, with respective salt prices of 31 sous and 591 sous, over 3000 soldiers were stationed in response to the massive amounts of smuggling that took place.

==French Revolution==
There are many reasons for the French Revolution, but the unfair taxes and financial burden imposed upon the lower-classes and peasants was a main facet of the general population&#x27;s discontent. Each year, by the end of the 18th century, about 3000 citizens (men, women, and children) were being imprisoned, sent to the galleys, or put to death for crimes against the &quot;gabelle&quot;. All the while, religious persons, nobility, and high-ranking officials were often exempt from the &quot;gabelle&quot; or paid much lower taxes. In 1789, following the ascension of the National Assembly, the &quot;gabelle&quot; was voted down and abolished throughout France. In 1790 the National Assembly decided that all persons imprisoned for breaking laws pertaining to the &quot;gabelle&quot; were to be freed from prison and that all charges and convictions were to be permanently dropped. This freedom would be short lived as Napoleon Bonaparte reinstated the &quot;gabelle&quot; in 1804, this time without major exemptions for regions such as Brittany. The &quot;gabelle&quot; stayed part of France&#x27;s legislation until abolished in 1946.

<text>A djembe or jembe ( ; from Malinke &quot;jembe&quot; , N&#x27;Ko: ) is a rope-tuned skin-covered goblet drum played with bare hands, originally from West Africa.
According to the Bambara people in Mali, the name of the djembe comes from the saying &quot;Anke djé, anke bé&quot; which translates to &quot;everyone gather together in peace&quot; and defines the drum&#x27;s purpose. In the Bambara language, &quot;djé&quot; is the verb for &quot;gather&quot; and &quot;bé&quot; translates as &quot;peace.&quot;

The djembe has a body (or shell) carved of hardwood and a drumhead made of untreated (not limed) rawhide, most commonly made from goatskin. Excluding rings, djembes have an exterior diameter of 30–38 cm (12–15 in) and a height of 58–63 cm (23–25 in). The majority have a diameter in the 13 to 14 inch range. The weight of a djembe ranges from 5 kg to 13 kg (11–29 lb) and depends on size and shell material. A medium-size djembe carved from one of the traditional woods (including skin, rings, and rope) weighs around 9 kg (20 lb).

The djembe can produce a wide variety of sounds, making it an extremely versatile drum. The drum is very loud, allowing it to be heard clearly as a solo instrument over a large percussion ensemble. The Malinké people say that a skilled drummer is one who &quot;can make the djembe talk&quot;, meaning that the player can tell an emotional story (the Malinké never used the djembe as a signaling drum).

Traditionally, the djembe is played only by men, as are the &quot;dunun&quot; that always accompany the djembe. Conversely, other percussion instruments that are commonly played as part of an ensemble, such as the &quot;shekere&quot; (a hollowed-out gourd covered with a net of beads), &quot;karignan&quot; (a tubular bell), and &quot;kese kese&quot; (a woven basket rattle), are usually played by women. Even today, it is rare to see women play djembe or dunun in West Africa, and African women express astonishment when they do see a female djembe player.

==Origin==

There is general agreement that the origin of the djembe is associated with the Mandinka caste of blacksmiths, known as &quot;Numu&quot;. The wide dispersion of the djembe drum throughout West Africa may be due to Numu migrations during the first millennium AD. Despite the association of the djembe with the Numu, there are no hereditary restrictions on who may become a &quot;djembefola&quot; (literally, &quot;one who plays the djembe&quot;). This is in contrast to instruments whose use is reserved for members of the &quot;griot&quot; caste, such as the &quot;balafon&quot;, &quot;kora&quot;, and &quot;ngoni&quot;. (The djembe is not a griot instrument.) Anyone who plays djembe is a djembefola—the term does not imply a particular level of skill.

Geographically, the traditional distribution of the djembe is associated with the Mali Empire, which dates back to 1230 AD and included parts of the modern-day countries of Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gambia, and Senegal. However, due to the lack of written records in West African countries, it is unclear whether the djembe predates or postdates the Mali Empire. It seems likely that the history of the djembe reaches back for at least several centuries and possibly more than a millennium.

The goblet shape of the djembe suggests that it originally may have been created from a mortar. (Mortars are widely used throughout West Africa for food preparation.)

==Recent history==
Prior to the 1950s and the decolonization of West Africa, due to the very limited travel of native Africans outside their own ethnic group, the djembe was known only in its original area.

===National ballets===
The djembe first came to the attention of audiences outside West Africa with the efforts of Fodéba Keïta, who, in 1952, founded Les Ballets Africains. The ballet toured extensively in Europe and was declared Guinea&#x27;s first national ballet by Guinea&#x27;s first president, Sékou Touré, after Guinea gained independence in 1958, to be followed by two more national ballets, the Ballet d&#x27;Armee in 1961 and Ballet Djoliba in 1964.

Touré&#x27;s policies alienated Guinea from the West and he followed the Eastern Bloc model of using the country&#x27;s culture and music for promotional means. He and Fodéba Keïta, who had become a close friend of Touré, saw the ballets as a way to secularize traditional customs and rites of different ethnic groups in Guinea. The ballets combined rhythms and dances from widely different spiritual backgrounds in a single performance, which suited the aim of Touré&#x27;s demystification program of &quot;doing away with &#x27;fetishist&#x27; ritual practices&quot;.

Touré generously supported the ballets (to the point of building a special rehearsal and performance space in his palace for Ballet Djoliba) and, until his death in 1984, financed extensive world-wide performance tours, which brought the djembe to the attention of Western audiences. Other countries followed Touré&#x27;s example and founded national ballets in the 1960s, including Ivory Coast (Ballet Koteba), Mali (Les Ballets Malien), and Senegal (Le Ballet National du Senegal), each with its own attached political agenda.

===Emigration===
In the United States, Ladji Camara, a member of Ballets Africains in the 1950s, started teaching djembe in the 1960s and continued to teach into the 1990s. Camara performed extensively with Babatunde Olatunji during the 1970s, greatly raising awareness of the instrument in the US.

After the death of Sekou Touré in 1984, funding for the ballets dried up and a number of djembefolas (who were never paid well by the ballets) emigrated and made regular teaching and performance appearances in the west, including Mamady Keïta (Belgium, US), Famoudou Konaté (Germany), and Epizo Bangoura (France, US, and Australia). A number of other djembefolas—M&#x27;bemba Bangoura, Abdoulaye Diakité, Bolokada Conde, Mohamed &quot;Bangouraké&quot; Bangoura, and Babara Bangoura, among others—followed their example, establishing a sizeable population of expatriate performers and teachers in many Western countries.

===Film===

The 1991 documentary &quot;Djembefola&quot; by Laurent Chevallier depicts Mamady Keïta&#x27;s return to the village of his birth after a 26-year absence. Upon release, the movie won the Wisselzak Trophy and Special Jury Award at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, and the Audience Award at the Marseille Festival of Documentary Film, and brought the djembe to the attention of a wide audience.

A 1998 follow-up documentary, &quot;Mögöbalu&quot; (also by Chevallier), contains concert footage uniting four master drummers (Soungalo Coulibaly, Mamady Keita, Famoudou Konaté, and Doudou N&#x27;Diaye Rose) on stage.

The Oscar-nominated 2007 drama &quot;The Visitor&quot; ensured that the djembe was noticed internationally by mainstream viewers.

===Western music===
The djembe has been used by many western artists, including Paul Simon, Cirque du Soleil, and Tool, raising awareness of the instrument with western audiences.

===Recordings===
Recordings of the djembe far surpass the number of recordings of any other African drum. Beginning in the late 1980s, a slew of djembe-centric recordings was released, a trend that, as of 2014, shows no sign of abating. This is significant because these recordings are driven by the demand of western audiences; there are almost no djembe recordings within African markets.

===Educational material===
Among the earliest educational resources available to a student of the djembe were an educational VHS tape by Babatunde Olatunji released in 1993, as well as books by Serge Blanc, Famoudou Konaté, and Mamady Keïta. In 1998, these were supplemented by a three-volume VHS set by Keïta and, in 2000, by a VHS tape by Epizo Bangoura. Since then, the market for educational materials has grown significantly. As of 2014, dozens of educational books, CDs, and videos are available to an aspiring player.

===Tourism===
Starting in the 1980s, a number of Guinean djembefolas (Epizo Bangoura, Famoudou Konaté, Mamady Keïta) started hosting study tours to Guinea, allowing djembe students to experience Guinean culture first-hand. Many other djembefolas followed suit; as of 2014, a potential visitor can select from tens of djembe tours each year. Djembe tourism created a market for djembefolas in Guinea that previously did not exist. Young djembefolas try to emulate the success of their predecessors and cater to the needs of the tourists, leading to change and commodification of the original djembe culture.

===Commercially produced instruments===
Most djembes from Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Senegal are still hand carved from traditional species of wood, using traditional tools and methods. In the 1990s, djembes started being produced elsewhere, such as in Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, and Indonesia, often using modern machinery and substitute species of wood, such as tweneboa (&quot;Cordia platythyrsa&quot;) or mahogany (&quot;Swietenia mahagoni&quot; or &quot;Toona sureni&quot;). However, these woods, being softer and less dense, are not as suitable as the traditional woods. A number of western percussion instrument manufacturers also produce djembe-like instruments, often with fibreglass bodies, synthetic skins, and a key tuning system.

===Women djembefolas===
The traditional barriers against women djembe and dunun players have come down over time.
* In 1998, Mamoudou Conde, director of the ballets &quot;Les Percussions de Guinée&quot;, &quot;Les Ballets Africains&quot;, and &quot;Ballet Djoliba&quot;, began to explore the idea of including women djembe and dunun players in ballet performances, against considerable initial resistance from male performers. Despite this, he included two female djembe players in the 2000 American tour of &quot;Les Percussions de Guinée&quot;. Based on positive feedback from that tour, Conde decided to form an all-female ballet group called &quot;Amazones: The Women Master Drummers of Guinea&quot; (renamed &quot;Nimbaya!&quot; in 2010). The group first toured the US in 2004 and continues to perform, with tour dates scheduled out to 2014.
* There are several notable female djembefolas, including Salimata Diabaté from Burkina Faso (lead djembefola of &quot;Afro Faso Jeunesse&quot;), Monette Marino-Keita from San Diego (winner of the 1st National &quot;Hand Drum-Off&quot; Competition in 2001), Anne-Yolaine Diarra from France (djembefola with &quot;Sokan&quot;), and Melissa Hie from Burkina Faso (lead djembefola of &quot;Benkadi&quot;).

==Sound and beating technique==

For its size, the djembe is an unusually loud drum. The volume of the drum rises with increasing skin tension. On a djembe tuned to solo pitch, skilled players can achieve sound pressure of more than 105 dB, about the same volume as a jackhammer.

Djembe players use three basic sounds: &quot;bass&quot;, &quot;tone&quot;, and &quot;slap&quot;, which have low, medium, and high pitch, respectively. These sounds are achieved by varying the striking technique and position. Other sounds are possible (masters achieve as many as twenty-five distinctly different sounds), but these additional sounds are used rarely, mainly for special effects during a solo performance (&quot;djembe kan&quot;, literally, &quot;the sound of the djembe&quot;). A skilled player can use the sounds to create very complex rhythmic patterns; the combination of rhythm and the differently pitched sounds often leads an inexpert listener to believe that more than one drum is being played.

The bass sound is produced by striking the drum with the palm and flat fingers near the center of the skin. Tone and slap are produced by striking the drum closer to the edge; the contact area of the fingers determines whether the sound is a tone or a slap. For a tone, most of the area of the fingers and the edge of the palm contact the skin whereas, for a slap, the contact area is limited to the edge of the palm and the fingertips. The basic sounds are played &quot;open&quot;, meaning that the hands rebound immediately after a strike, so the contact time with the skin is as short as possible.

Acoustically, a djembe is a Helmholtz resonator: the frequency of the bass is determined by the size and shape of the shell and independent of the amount of tension on the skin. In contrast, the pitch of tones and slaps rises as the tension of the skin is increased. The bass has a frequency of 65–80 Hz. Depending on the size of the drum and the amount of tension on the skin, tone frequency varies from 300 Hz to 420 Hz and slap frequency from 700 Hz to 1000 Hz, with audible overtones reaching beyond 4 kHz.


The difference in pitch of the sounds arises because the different striking techniques selectively emphasize specific vibrational modes of the drum head. A tone emphasizes the (0,1) mode while suppressing the bass (Helmholtz resonance) and higher-order modes as much as possible. A slap emphasizes the (2,1), (0,2), (3,1), (1,2), and (0,3) modes (as well as higher-order modes) while suppressing the Helmholtz resonance and the (0,1) and (1,1) modes. Skilled players can also produce a medium-pitched sound (between a tone and slap) that is variously called &quot;third slap&quot;, &quot;tonpalo&quot;, or &quot;lé&quot;; this sound emphasizes the (1,1) mode while suppressing all other modes as much as possible.

By slightly varying striking and finger position, skilled players can selectively emphasize different slap harmonics and create melodies of differently pitched slaps.

==Role in the traditional ensemble==
Traditionally, the djembe forms an ensemble with a number of other djembes and one or more dunun. Except for the &quot;lead&quot; (or &quot;solo&quot;) djembe, all instruments play a recurring rhythmic figure that is known as an &quot;accompaniment pattern&quot; or &quot;accompaniment part&quot;. The figure repeats after a certain number of beats, known as a &quot;cycle&quot;. The most common cycle length is four beats, but cycles often have other lengths, such as two, three, six, eight or more beats. (Some rhythms in the dundunba family from the Hamana region in Guinea have cycle lengths of 16, 24, 28, or 32 beats, among others.) Cycles longer than eight beats are rare for djembe accompaniments—longer cycles are normally played only by the &quot;dununba&quot; or &quot;sangban&quot;.

Each instrument plays a different rhythmic figure, and the cycle lengths of the different instruments need not necessarily be the same. This interplay results in complex rhythmic patterns (&quot;polyrhythms&quot;). The different accompaniment parts are played on djembes that are tuned to different pitches; this emphasizes the polyrhythm and creates a composite overall melody.

The number of instruments in the ensemble varies with the region and occasion. In Mali, a traditional ensemble often consists of one dunun (called &quot;konkoni&quot;) and one djembe. The konkoni and djembe are in a rhythmic dialog, with each drum taking turns playing accompaniment while the other instrument plays improvised solos. If a second dunun player is available, he supplements the ensemble with a &quot;khassonka dunun&quot;, which is a bass drum similar in build to a konkoni, but larger.

In Guinea, a typical ensemble uses three djembes and three dunun, called &quot;sangban&quot; (medium pitch), &quot;dundunba&quot; (bass pitch), and &quot;kenkeni&quot; (high pitch, also called &quot;kensedeni&quot;). If an ensemble includes more than one djembe, the highest pitched (and therefore loudest) djembe plays solo phrases and the other djembes and dunun play accompaniment.

An ensemble may have only two dunun, depending on whether a village has enough dunun players and is wealthy enough to afford three dunun.

A djembe and dunun ensemble traditionally does not play music for people to simply sit back and listen to. Instead, the ensemble creates rhythm for people to dance, sing, clap, or work to. The western distinction between musicians and audience is inappropriate in a traditional context. A rhythm is rarely played as a performance, but is participatory: musicians, dancers, singers, and onlookers are all part of the ensemble and frequently change roles while the music is in progress.

Musicians and participants often form a circle, with the centre of the circle reserved for dancers. Depending on the particular rhythm being played, dances may be performed by groups of men and/or women with choreographed steps, or single dancers may take turns at performing short solos. The lead djembe&#x27;s role is to play solo phrases that accentuate the movements of the dancers. Often, the aim is to &quot;mark the dancers&#x27; feet&quot;, that is, to play rhythmic patterns that are synchronized with the dancers&#x27; steps. Individual solo dances are not choreographed, with the dancer freely moving in whatever way feels appropriate at that moment. Marking a solo dancer&#x27;s feet requires the lead djembefola to have strong rapport with the dancer, and it takes many years of experience for a djembefola to acquire the necessary rhythmic repertoire.

The lead djembefola also improvises to a rhythm at times when no-one is dancing. While there is considerable freedom in such improvisation, the solo phrases are not random. Instead, individual rhythms have specific key patterns (signature phrases) that the soloist is expected to know and integrate into his improvisation. A skilled soloist will also play phrases that harmonize with the background rhythm (&quot;groove&quot;) that is created by the other instruments.

==Construction==

=== Shell ===
Traditionally crafted djembes are carved from a single log of hardwood. A number of different wood species are used, all of which are hard and dense. Hardness and density are important factors for the sound and projection of the djembe. The most prized djembe wood is &quot;lenke&quot; (&quot;Afzelia africana&quot;), not because it necessarily sounds better than other woods, but because the Malinké believe that its spiritual qualities are superior. (Malinké traditional wisdom states that a spiritual energy, or &quot;nyama&quot;, runs through all things, living or dead.) Besides lenke, traditional woods include &quot;djalla&quot; (&quot;Khaya senegalensis&quot;), &quot;dugura&quot; (&quot;Cordyla africana&quot;), &quot;gueni&quot; (&quot;Pterocarpus erinaceus&quot;), &quot;gele&quot; (&quot;Prosopis africana&quot;), and &quot;iroko&quot; (&quot;Milicia excelsa&quot;).

Shells are carved soon after the tree is felled while the wood still retains some moisture and is softer. This makes the wood easier to carve and avoids radial splits that tend to develop in logs that are allowed to dry naturally. Carvers use simple hand tools, such as axes, adzes, spoke shaves, and rasps to shape the shell. A well-carved djembe does not have a smooth interior but a texture of scallops or shallow grooves that influence the sound of the instrument. (Djembes with smooth interiors have tones and slaps with too much sustain.) Often, interior grooves form a spiral pattern, which indicates a carver taking pride in his work.

=== Skin ===
The djembe is headed with a rawhide skin, most commonly goatskin. Other skins, such as antelope, cow, kangaroo, or horse can be used as well. Thicker skins, such as cow, have a warmer sound with more overtones in the slaps; thinner skins have a sharper sound with fewer overtones in the slaps and are louder. Thick skins make it easier to play full tones but more difficult to play sharp slaps; for thin skins, the opposite applies. Thin skins are louder than thick ones. Thick skins, such as cow, are particularly hard on the hands of the player and cause more callousing than goatskins.

Skins from dry and hot-climate areas and poorly fed goats are preferred for djembes because of their low fat content. Skins from cold-climate goats with high-value nutrition have more than double the fat content; they tend to sound dull and lifeless in comparison. Even though the fat content of male goats is lower than that of female goats, many players prefer female skins because they do not smell as strongly and are reputed to be softer.

The skin is mounted with the spine running through the centre of the drum head, with the line of the spine pointing at the player, so the hands strike either side of the spine. Animal skins are thicker at the spine than the sides; mounting the skin with the spine centered ensures that the left and right hand play symmetric areas of equal size and thickness. In turn, this helps to minimize differences in pitch of the notes played by the left and right hand. Normally, the head end of the spine points at the player, so the hands strike the area of the skin that used to be the shoulders of the goat. With thicker skins, such as from a cow or horse, the skin round is usually taken from the side of the hide so it does not include the spine, which is too thick for use on a djembe.

Skins may be shaved prior to mounting or afterwards, or may be de-haired by liming. Liming weakens skins; some djembefolas also claim that limed skins are harder on their hands and do not sound as good as untreated skins.

Factory-made djembes often use skins made from synthetic materials, such as FiberSkyn.

=== Rope ===
Modern djembes exclusively use synthetic rope, most commonly of kernmantle construction, 4–5 mm in diameter. Low-stretch (static) rope is preferred. Most djembe ropes have a polyester core with a 16‑ or 32‑plait mantle and around 5% stretch. Very low-stretch (&lt;1%) rope materials, such as Vectran and Spectra, are used only rarely due to their much higher cost.
===Mounting system===
The mounting system for the skin has undergone a number of changes over time.

====Traditional mounting====
Originally, the skin was attached by wooden pegs that were driven through holes in the skin and the shell near the playing edge. Four to five people would stretch the wet skin over the drum to apply tension while the pegs were driven into the bowl. The shrinkage of the skin while it dried then applied sufficient additional tension for the skin to resonate. A similar mounting technique is still used by the Landouma (a subgroup of the Baga people) for a djembe-like drum known as a &quot;gumbe&quot;. This mounting technique most likely goes back hundreds of years; the exact period is unknown.

Up until the 1980s, the most common mounting system used twisted strips of cowhide as rope. The skin was attached with rings made of cowhide; one ring was sewn into the perimeter of the skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together. A long strip of cowhide was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.

The pitch of these traditional djembes was much lower than it is today because the natural materials imposed a limit on the amount of tension that could be applied. Prior to playing, djembefolas heated the skin near the flames of an open fire, which drives moisture out of the skin and causes it to shrink and increase the pitch of the drum. This process had to be repeated frequently, every 15–30 minutes.

====Modern mounting====
The modern mounting system arose in the early seventies, when touring ballets came into contact with synthetic rope used by the military. Initially, the synthetic rope was used to replace the twisted cowhide strips. However, the rope could now be tightened to the point where it tore through the skin; in response, drum makers started using steel rings instead of twisted cowhide to hold the skin in place. Despite objections from many djembefolas, the modern mounting system gradually displaced the traditional one and, by 1991 had completely replaced it.

The skin is held in place by being trapped between the top ring, called the &quot;crown ring&quot;, and the ring below it, called the &quot;flesh ring&quot;. A third ring (the &quot;bottom ring&quot;) is placed around the stem. The rings are commonly made from 6–8 mm (¼–⅓ in) rebar. A series of cow hitches on the crown ring and bottom ring form loops. Through these loops, a length of rope connects the crown ring and the bottom ring; tightening this rope applies tension. As the vertical rope is tensioned, the cow hitches on the crown ring press the skin against the flesh ring below; this attaches the skin to the flesh ring very securely and stretches the skin over the bearing edge of the drum.


A variation of this technique, introduced in the early 2000s, uses three rings instead of two. The idea of this technique is to increase the number of friction points trapping the skin to make it less likely for the skin to slip between the rings as tension is applied. There is no firm consensus in the djembe community as to whether the benefits of this mounting are worth the extra weight and added complexity.

To prevent damage to the rope from rust flakes, as well as for aesthetic reasons, the rings are often wrapped with strips of colored cloth.

Factory-made djembes (often from synthetic materials, such as fiberglass), use a similar system. However, instead of by vertical ropes, the top ring is pulled against the flesh ring by mechanical lugs that are tightened with a wrench.

==Tuning==

After initial tightening of the verticals, a djembe is tuned by creating twists in the verticals to shorten them (&quot;Mali weave&quot;). With more than one completed row of twists, the vertical rope forms diamond shapes that can be quite decorative. Well-applied Mali weave keeps the rope that runs across the verticals horizontal, without gradually climbing up in a spiral pattern.
The amount of tension that can be applied this way is considerable. A djembe tuned to solo pitch has a tone frequency of around 400 Hz. For a drum with a 31 cm (12.2 in) playing surface, this equates to an overall pull force of around 455 kg (1,000 lb), or 15,000 newton per meter (N/m) of tension. Modern djembes often feature tuning lugs, similar to those found on snare drums, allowing the drum to be tuned with a drum key. Additionally, the drum heads on contemporary djembes can be made from a variety of materials, ranging from synthetic options to organic materials like goatskin.

==Decoration==

Instead of trimming the skin off above the crown ring, the drum maker can fold the skin over so it covers the crown ring. This is done for aesthetic purposes; the fold-over does not serve to hold the skin in place.

Djembefolas frequently attach one to four metal rattles to their drum, known as &quot;sege sege&quot; (Malinké) or &quot;sesse&quot; (Susu), also called &quot;ksink ksink&quot;. The rattles serve as decoration as well as to create a richer sound. Sege sege are not a status symbol or indicative of playing skill. Anyone can attach sege sege to their djembe, regardless of their ability or whom they are playing with, without causing offence or breaking etiquette.

Ropes of different color can be wrapped around the bowl of the drum as decoration. (To tune the drum, the rope wrap must be removed.) Djembes may also be decorated with cowrie shells, coloured paint, decorative tacks, or other metalwork.

Traditionally, carvings on djembes (if any) are limited to the foot. Depending on the country of origin, different patterns are used; traditional carving styles are usually quite plain and restrained. In the 2000s, western demand and competition among carvers resulted in more and more elaborate carvings that can cover all of the foot and, in some cases, include the bowl of the drum.


Particularly in Guinea, drum makers often fit motorcycle tires to the foot of a djembe, both for decoration and to prevent the drum from slipping when playing seated on a slippery floor. This trend started in the late 1990s and evolved from the practice of attaching timing belts to the foot of djembes as a decoration.

==Study==
Traditionally, as today, in Africa an individual needs to spend many years accompanying his master in ceremonies and other festivities before becoming a real djembefola (djembe player). Today in the communities of western civilization learning to play the djembe generally involves finding a master drummer and having private lessons or lessons for small groups of people.
Players generally need to learn the basic sounds and traditional rhythm samples (4/4 and 12/8) to be able to follow classes. Many years of playing and learning are needed to be able to produce a sound that is comparable in its quality to that of a master drummer.

Written transcriptions of rhythms tend to be imprecise. Usually only the basic idea of the rhythm is transcribed but the real feeling that it carries can&#x27;t be easily put down on paper. This is due to the nature of the West African music—the different types of swing (at least four of them) that are not easily expressible with western notation. For this reason, written material for advanced players is still scarce if not unavailable, while general and informational literature can be easily obtained.

With the advent of musical software such as Percussion Studio, transcribing and reproducing rhythms has become easier. Musical software can be useful for people who don&#x27;t have a group to practice with, as individual tracks can be isolated or tempo changed to assist with playing along and learning/practising. A competent user is able to reproduce material learnt in a workshop for later use. Notwithstanding its utility as a basic transcription tool, Percussion Studio cannot reproduce the intonation and microtiming of a skilled player and has limited value, therefore, for transcribing solo. The drum machine software Hydrogen (software) contains Djembe, dunun and bell sound files that can be used to study as described above.

<text>Swallow is a small village and civil parish in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England, on the A46 road north-east from Caistor. The population (including Cabourne and Cuxwold) taken at the 2011 census was 289.

==History==
=== Etymology ===
The name Swallow has been variously written as Sualan (&quot;Domesday Book&quot;), Suawa, Swalwe and Swalewe (all twelfth century). &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Place Names&quot; equates the name with Swale, suggesting that the village is called after a fast-moving river of that name, with &quot;eau&quot; being French for water. Bob Willey, who used to live in the village, put forward the theory that it is closer to the German &quot;schwall&quot;, meaning &quot;flood&quot; and suggesting that water gathered on the clay bottom land below the fast-draining chalky hills.

===Early history===
Archaeological finds, including flint tools at Swallow Vale Farm, indicate the presence of early settlements in Swallow. Other traces include cropmark traces of four possible barrows, a pit and a boundary ditch on Cuxwold Road, and similar barrows behind Grange Farm and on the eastern edge of the village south of Grimsby Road. Straddling the Limber parish border are the remains of an undated ring ditch in Swallow Wold Wood.

Further finds include Roman pottery and coins, and the apparent remains of a Saxon leather worker. Ridges found in the field above the skeleton are further indications of a pre-Norman conquest settlement.

===Middle Ages===
The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; does not mention Swallow in detail, but in 1086 Lincolnshire was remote from the rest of the kingdom: cut off from the south by the undrained Fens, and occupied by hostile and rebellious Danes (Vikings). At this time, Swallow consisted of at least 35 households.

In Swallow the important landowners were Norman (the Bishop of Bayeux was William the Conqueror&#x27;s half-brother Odo of Bayeux), though low in the Norman hierarchy. Others mentioned in &quot;Domesday&quot; include Sualan (Archbishop of York), Count Alan, Roger de Poitou and Alfred of Lincoln.

By the 13th century Count Alan&#x27;s manor had passed into the hands of the Lascelles family, who may have been resident landlords and were closely involved with the parish church. Their successors, the Conyers family, were certainly non-resident. From around 1200 the manor of Swallow was held by the Augustinian abbey of Wellow in Grimsby. The Cistercian nuns of Nuncotham also had a holding, as did Thornton Abbey and Saint Leonard&#x27;s Priory (Grimsby) by the time of the Reformation.

In 1530 George St. Pol bought the former Lascelles Manor, and in 1543 he acquired the former abbey lands from John Bellewe and Robert Brocklesby, to whom they had been granted following the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

A survey in the early 14th recorded that Swallow had 26 households and 31 taxpayers, while a Poll Tax count in 1372 found 110 people over the age of fourteen. There were 18 taxpayers in 1525 but only 12 in 1543, and 20 households in 1563. These numbers remained fairly constant for the next three centuries.

Apart from the church, there are no obvious reminders of the medieval village. On closer examination, a few earthworks show a village of two centres. To the west there was a series of narrow closes and yards fronting Caistor Road with a back lane near where the present A46 runs. This and the ploughing strips are cut through by the much later Limber Road. Towards the end of the medieval period there were further closes on the south side of the road running down to the stream.

The Eastern Settlement shows signs of one or more monastic farms, a moated manor site and a mill.

===Enclosure===
Swallow dates from the 19th century enclosure. Until 1805 the majority of villagers had strips in two large fields, as well as grazing rights on the wold, the moor and in Horse Pasture.

However, this system started to lose viability as early as the Tudor period. From the mid 17th century, some Swallow residents described themselves as farmers rather than cottagers. By the end of the 18th century, improved agricultural methods and animal husbandry, together with the need to move from subsistence farming to large-scale food production for growing numbers of city and town dwellers, made change inevitable.

Swallow was enclosed by parliamentary act in 1805, and the award was completed in 1809. Apart from two small parcels awarded to the Bishop of Lincoln and Trinity College, Cambridge, and the Rector&#x27;s Glebe of , virtually all the land was awarded to Lord Yarborough. The Rector received corn rents in lieu of tithes. There were also about in the village and around the church which were old enclosure, and were for roads.

Within a few years, farms which still exist today – Vale, Wold, Mount, Grange and Rookery – had been built. Hedges were planted, new roads and lanes were built, and Lord Yarborough had begun the tree planting which so radically altered the countryside.

At enclosure, and for some time afterwards, Swallow&#x27;s houses were simple, single-storey buildings of mud and stud. These were gradually replaced by brick cottages, with the majority of those on Grimsby Road and Chapel Lane being built around 1875. Of the 45 houses in Swallow listed in the 1881 census, about two thirds survive.

In early 2008, a housing development project was completed in the village on the meadow by the beck.

===Parish registers and census===

The parish registers date back to 1671. It was rare for a family to remain in the village for more than two generations, and the majority of labourers moved on after a few years to get a better job or to leave farming. Even the better off farmers tended (being tenants rather than owners) to remain no more than two or three generations.

In the spring of 1841, during the Hungry Forties, fourteen children (about a quarter of all the village&#x27;s children) died. No adults died that year. In 1870, a further six children died, the last two of scarlet fever.

The registers also record the burial, in 1909, of an unknown man whose decayed remains had been found after 2–12 years&#x27; exposure.

The 1851 census shows 127 males and 90 females in 57 households. Ten years later the number of dwellings had reduced to 41 while the population had risen by 22.

The 1881 census shows 78% of all working males in farming, with 16% in allied trades – 92% in total. Of the adults, only 10% were born in Swallow, although only three were born outside Lincolnshire.

==Economy==

The earliest recorded shop in the village was at the forge in 1856; the blacksmith&#x27;s business itself continued until well into the 20th century. There was a tobacconist&#x27;s kiosk near Crossroads Cottages, the remains of which can be seen in a garden on Grimsby Road.

Later, a combination shop and post office was in Chapel Lane. In 1961 a new shop was opened at the corner of Cuxwold Road and Chapel Lane; it closed in 1976.

The village pub is the Swallow Inn. It was preceded by the White Hart, which closed in 1953.

===Church===

The oldest part of the church dates from the period of the Norman conquest or perhaps slightly earlier. The lower portion of the tower is in Saxo-Norman style; the west door has a rounded Romanesque arch, as has the window above it. The much wider arch dividing the tower from the nave has typically Norman dog-tooth carving, but this may be partly or wholly Victorian restoration.

A carving on the south wall of the tower may be part of the original 14th-century rood, thought to be broken during the Reformation. William Andrew, the rector from 1564 to 1612, supported the reformation and may have been responsible both for this and for the change of dedication from St Salvatoris (&quot;Saint Saviour&quot;) to Holy Trinity. The remains of the rood were unearthed in the churchyard and placed in the tower early in the 20th century.

In 1553 the church was reported to have three &quot;gert bells&quot; and one sanctus bell. However, the steeple collapsed sometime before 1663, and falling bells destroyed the south aisle. In 1670 both aisles were demolished (the north aisle having apparently been ruinous even before the collapse) and the following year the three bells were sold to cover the £140 cost of demolition and restoration, an incident referred to in the local rhyme:
:&quot;You must pity poor Swallow People&quot;
:&quot;Who sold the bells to mend the steeple&quot;

Sir Philip Tyrwhitt, who paid the cost initially, reportedly bought one bell and undertook to buy another. The bell was cast by Thomas Warner and Sons of London in 1864. The steeple was again restored in 1868, when the upper part of the tower was built in neo-Norman style.

The nave was originally built in the 13th century, but much of the current construction is Victorian. The carving around the south door dates from the 1880s. The font is genuinely Norman, dating from the late 11th or early 12th century.

The window in the south wall is Edwardian, given in memory of the rector, James Wallis Loft, and his wife.

The north aisle was built during the church&#x27;s restoration of 1883–84, when the old horse box pews, the gallery and the three-decker pulpit were removed. The pillar was also added at this time. The east window in memory of the Farrow-Bingham family also dates from the 1883 restoration.}

There is no south aisle now, but traces of it and the Lady chapel built in the 13th century can be seen on the exterior of the south wall. The 13th-century chancel was largely rebuilt in 1868 at a cost of £350. Traces of the original doorway can be seen on the exterior of the south wall. The pillar piscina is an example of Norman stonework.

Further major repairs were carried out in 1968 (at a cost of £650) and 1976 (£2,100).

In 1931 Swallow was united with the parish of Cabourne, and in 1979 Swallow with Cabourne was amalgamated with the benefices of Rothwell with Cuxwold, Thoresway with Croxby, and Nettleton as the Swallow Group of Parishes.

====Churchyard====
The churchyard has been a burial site for well over a thousand years. In 1765 a turnpike cut through some of the ancient burial ground, and in 1954 improvements to the then A46 took a further part of the churchyard. It was during these excavations that the Swallow Giant was unearthed – a man, possibly a Viking warrior, who stood between and tall.

Parts of the churchyard were levelled in 1970, causing damage to some gravestones. In the early 1980s a major tidying of the churchyard and the neighbouring corner green removed rotten trees and facilitated mowing. Since then there has been extensive tree-planting throughout the village, including the graveyard and green.

===War memorial===

A war memorial commemorates three soldiers who died in the First World War: Lieutenant Cecil Walter Henry Askey (died 5 April 1918), Gunner Walter Day (died 25 September 1918) and Stoker Kerdon Wilkin (died 7 March 1916).

===Rectories===

The Old Rectory, now a private residence, was built in 1864 to a design by James Fowler of Louth, the diocesan architect, at a cost of £1,700. Unlike the farmhouses, which were all built in variations on the vernacular style, it is clearly identifiable as a mid-Victorian building with its Gothic ornamentation.

The present rectory, built on Beelsby Road in 1958, is a more modest building in post-war style.

===Chapels===

As in many Lincolnshire villages in the 19th century, the people of Swallow practiced Methodism. A Primitive Methodist chapel was built in 1844 for £98, on a site on the Cuxwold Road donated by Lord Yarborough. In 1855 it was enlarged, but thereafter congregations declined and it closed in 1916. The building was eventually demolished in 1994.

A larger Wesleyan chapel was built on the north side of Back Lane (subsequently Chapel Lane) in 1863. It was designed to hold a congregation of 140, although membership never rose above 40. The chapel closed in 1967 and was demolished shortly afterwards, although a small fragment of the wall&#x27;s base remains.

===Housing since the Second World War===

After the Second World War, Swallow saw a number of changes. Like many similar villages, it became less of an estate village and more of a commuter-cum-retirement village with a number of cottages passing into private hands as the more intensive and mechanised agriculture necessitated by the need to feed the country during the war made them redundant as the homes of farm labourers. It isn&#x27;t until the 1970s that the Parish Registers begin to show any real variety of trades and professions.

From 1965 parcels of land were sold for building, and since then new houses have been built at the rate of about one a year in a wide variety of styles and materials.

=== Village pond ===

The Church and the avenue remain, although the house (Rookery) is gone, and the high bank is largely replaced by a retaining wall, and the pond was filled in during the 1960s and the land sold to make a garden for Pond Cottage. The site now has on it a modern house.

Until 1949 the village was served by a parish pump near to the entrance to the present playing field, although many houses had their own wells. Rookery Farm&#x27;s water was pumped by a windmill. In 1949 piped water came to the village, pumped from Barnoldby and then fed to Swallow by gravity from Beelsby Top. Electricity followed in 1950. Mains sewerage did not arrive until 1970, and mains gas later still. Outlying houses are still served by septic tanks and are without gas, although most now have mains water.

=== School and village hall ===

Although Swallow was a two classroom school for about fifty years, numbers fluctuated considerably; in 1941, when the only extant school log begins, it was a one teacher school, and was again on many subsequent occasions. November 1948 brought an excellent report from the school inspectors citing Swallow as a model for Rural One Teacher Schools; less than a year later Miss Marris was appointed assistant to Miss Frances Cox. On 4 November 1949, the school was on display when D.R. Hardman, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of education, visited.

In June 1946 work began on installing a school kitchen, but in July 1949, following a huge intake of ten new pupils, the canteen became the infant classroom and the end cloakroom the cookhouse. In January 1959 it dispensed with the services of a cook and had meals sent from the central canteen.

The school was closed in May 1968 and the children transferred to Caistor Primary School where they joined existing classes, in some cases for just one term before going up to secondary school. A number of mothers kept their children from school for a period because of the inadequate transport arrangements. It was not the first time that Swallow children had been sent to Caistor; from 31 March to 30 November 1945, following the illness and resignation of Joan Marrows as headmistress, Swallow School was closed.

After the school closed the ownership of the building reverted to Lord Yarborough, and in 1969 he sold it to the village for a nominal £150 on condition that it would be returned to him if it could not be maintained as a village hall for twenty-one years.

In 1990 it was handed over to the village, the Parish Council taking over the trusteeship shortly thereafter together with responsibility for the day-to-day running expenses, leaving the Village Hall Committee to raise money for capital projects. There is an irregular programme of social evenings, talks, quizzes and demonstrations approximately monthly. Most years there are more major events – a craft and garden show, an exhibition, or a traditional village fete (usually in conjunction with the Church). An extension was built to house a bar. The Village Hall Committee is also responsible for maintaining the playing field for which the Parish Council pays Sutton Estates a quarterly peppercorn rent. Some play equipment was paid for by fund-raising events in the 1990s.

After 2005 the hall was improved, and is a venue for small conferences, parties and wedding receptions.

==Transport==

Prior to the Grimsby Turnpike Act of 1765 the road (track) through Swallow was a green road running from Swallow to Rothwell until the Second World War when it was ploughed up to grow crops and never re-instated. The new turnpike road cut through the ancient burial ground and tolls were paid to travel along it.

In 1954 a road straightening and widening scheme on the then A46 (Caistor Road) through the village took a further part of the churchyard, and during these excavations the skeleton of the Swallow Giant was unearthed.

After many years, Swallow was by-passed in 1992 (at the expense of a mature tree, farmland, hedgerows and the football field) and Grimsby Road and Caistor Road became cul-de-sacs.

Work on the bypass started in November 1991. The contract of £2.25m was given to Morrison Shand, for 3.6km, to take 52 weeks. It would be finished by July 1992, taking 8 months.
The bypass was opened on Thursday 23 July 1992, by Bill Wyrrill, leader of the county council.

<text>Meghalaya (; &quot;the abode of clouds&quot;) is a state in northeast India. Meghalaya was formed on 21 January 1972 by carving out two districts from the state of Assam: (a) the United Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills and (b) the Garo Hills. The estimated population of Meghalaya in 2014 was 3,211,474. Meghalaya covers an area of approximately 22,429 square kilometres, with a length-to-breadth ratio of about 3:1.

The state is bound to the south by the Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh and Sylhet, to the west by the Bangladeshi division of Rangpur, and to the north and east by India&#x27;s State of Assam. The capital of Meghalaya is Shillong. During the British rule of India, the British authorities nicknamed it the &quot;Scotland of the East&quot;. English is the official language of Meghalaya. Unlike many Indian states, Meghalaya has historically followed a matrilineal system where the lineage and inheritance are traced through women; the youngest daughter inherits all wealth and she also takes care of her parents.

The state is the wettest region of India, with the wettest areas in the southern Khasi Hills recording an average of of rain a year. About 70 per cent of the state is forested. The Meghalaya subtropical forests ecoregion encompasses the state; its mountain forests are distinct from the lowland tropical forests to the north and south. The forests are notable for their biodiversity of mammals, birds, and plants.

Meghalaya has a predominantly agrarian economy with a significant commercial forestry industry. The important crops are potatoes, rice, maize, pineapples, bananas, papayas, and spices. The service sector is made up of real estate and insurance companies. Meghalaya&#x27;s gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at in current prices. The state is geologically rich in minerals, but it has no significant industries. The state has about of national highways. It is also a major logistical center for trade with Bangladesh.

In July 2018, the International Commission on Stratigraphy divided the Holocene epoch into three, with the late Holocene being called the &quot;Meghalayan stage/age&quot;, since a speleothem in Mawmluh cave indicating a dramatic worldwide climate event around 2250 BCE had been chosen as the boundary stratotype.

One of the biggest Central Institutes, the North Eastern Council Secretariat, is also situated in Shillong.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Meghālaya&quot; means &quot;the abode of clouds&quot;; the name derives from a compound of the Sanskrit words &quot;megha&quot; (&quot;cloud&quot;, मेघ) and &quot;alaya&quot; (&quot;abode&quot;, आलय)

== History ==

Meghalaya, alongside the neighbouring Indian states, has been of archaeological interest. People have lived in Meghalaya since the Neolithic period. Neolithic sites discovered so far are located in areas of high elevation in Khasi Hills, Garo Hills and in neighbouring states, where Neolithic style &quot;jhum&quot; or shifting cultivation is practised even today. The highland plateaus fed by abundant rains provided safety from floods and a rich soil. The importance of Meghalaya is its possible role in human history via domestication of rice. A theory for the origin of rice is by Ian Glover while states, &quot;India is the center of greatest diversity of domesticated rice with over 20,000 identified species and Northeast India is the most favorable single area of the origin of domesticated rice.&quot; The limited archaeology done in the hills of Meghalaya suggest human settlement since ancient times.

After the Conquest of Taraf in 1304, Shah Arifin Rafiuddin, a disciple of Shah Jalal, migrated and settled in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills where he preached Islamic monotheism to the local people. His khanqah remains in Sarping / Laurergarh on the Bangladeshi border but the part containing his mazar is in Meghalaya on top of Laur Hill.

Bhaitbari is an archaeological site first discovered and excavated by A. K. Sharma in 1993, a fortification of burnt brick with mud core was discovered at Meghalaya - Assam border and is dated to 4th-8th century AD, the city has been speculated to have been one of the capital cities of Kamarupa.

The British discovered &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; (tea shrub) in 1834 in Assam and later companies started renting land from 1839 onwards.

The Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia tribes had their own kingdoms until they came under British administration in the 19th century. Later, the British incorporated Meghalaya into Assam in 1835. The region enjoyed semi-independent status by virtue of a treaty relationship with the British Crown. When Bengal was partitioned on 16 October 1905 by Lord Curzon, Meghalaya became a part of the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. When the partition was reversed in 1912, Meghalaya became a part of the province of Assam. On 3 January 1921 in pursuance of Section 52A of the Government of India Act of 1919, the governor-general-in-council declared the areas now in Meghalaya, other than the Khasi states, as &quot;backward tracts.&quot; Subsequently, the British administration enacted the Government of India Act 1935, which regrouped the backward tracts into two categories: &quot;excluded&quot; and &quot;partially excluded&quot; areas.

At the time of Indian independence in 1947, present-day Meghalaya constituted two districts of Assam and enjoyed limited autonomy within the state of Assam. A movement for a separate hill state began in 1960. On 11 September 1968, the Government of India announced a scheme for constituting an autonomous state within the state of Assam comprising certain areas specified in Part A of the table appended to paragraph 20 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution. Accordingly, the Assam Reorganisation (Meghalaya) Act of 1969 was enacted for the formation of an autonomous state. Meghalaya was formed by carving out two districts from the state of Assam: the United Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills, and the Garo Hills. The name &#x27;Meghalaya&#x27; coined by geographer S.P. Chatterjee in 1936 was proposed and accepted for the new state. The Act came into effect on 2 April 1970, with the autonomous state having a 37-member legislature in accordance with the Sixth Schedule to the Indian constitution.

In 1971, the Parliament passed the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971, which conferred full statehood on the autonomous state of Meghalaya. Meghalaya attained statehood on 21 January 1972, with a Legislative Assembly of its own.

== Geography ==

Meghalaya is one of the Seven Sister States of northeast India. The state of Meghalaya is mountainous, with stretches of valley and highland plateaus, and it is geologically rich. It consists mainly of Archean rock formations. These rock formations contain rich deposits of valuable minerals like coal, limestone, uranium and sillimanite. The name Meghalaya was given by Shiba P. Chatterjee, a geography professor at the University of Calcutta.
Meghalaya has many rivers. Most of these are rainfed and seasonal. The important rivers in the Garo Hills region are Ganol, Daring, Sanda, Bandra, Bugai, Dareng, Simsang, Nitai and the Bhupai. In the central and eastern sections of the plateau, the important rivers are Khri, Umtrew, Digaru, Umiam or Barapani, Kynshi (Jadukata), Umngi, Mawpa, Umiam Khwan, Umngot, Umkhen, Myntdu and Myntang. In the southern Khasi Hills region, these rivers have created deep gorges and several waterfalls.
The elevation of the plateau ranges between to . The central part of the plateau comprising the Khasi Hills has the highest elevations, followed by the eastern section comprising the Jaintia Hills region. The highest point in Meghalaya is Shillong Peak, which is a prominent IAF station in the Khasi Hills overlooking the city of Shillong. It has an altitude of 1961 m. The Garo Hills region in the western section of the plateau is nearly plain. The highest point in the Garo Hills is Nokrek Peak with an altitude of 1515 m.

=== Climate ===
With the average annual rainfall as high as in some areas, Meghalaya is the wettest place on Earth. The western part of the plateau, comprising the Garo Hills region with lower elevations, experiences high temperatures for most of the year. The Shillong area, with the highest elevations, experiences generally low temperatures. The maximum temperature in this region rarely goes beyond , whereas sub-zero winter temperatures are common.
The town of Sohra (Cherrapunji) in the Khasi Hills south of capital Shillong holds the world record for most rain in a calendar month, while the village of Mawsynram, near Sohra (Cherrapunji), holds the record for the most rain in a year.

=== Flora and fauna ===
About 70% of the state is forested, of which is dense primary subtropical forest. The Meghalayan forests are considered to be among the richest botanical habitats of Asia. These forests receive abundant rainfall and support a vast variety of floral and faunal biodiversity. A small portion of the forest area in Meghalaya is under what are known as &quot;sacred groves&quot; (see Sacred groves of India). These are small pockets of an ancient forest that have been preserved by the communities for hundreds of years due to religious and cultural beliefs. These forests are reserved for religious rituals and generally remain protected from any exploitation. These sacred groves harbour many rare plant and animal species. The Nokrek Biosphere Reserve in the West Garo Hills and the Balpakram National Park in the South Garo Hills are considered to be the most biodiversity-rich sites in Meghalaya. In addition, Meghalaya has three wildlife sanctuaries. These are the Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary, the Siju Sanctuary, and the Baghmara Sanctuary, which is also the home of the insect-eating pitcher plant &quot;Nepenthes khasiana&quot; also called &quot;Me&#x27;mang Koksi&quot; in the Garo language.

Due to diverse climatic and topographic conditions, Meghalaya forests support a vast floral diversity, including a large variety of parasites, epiphytes, succulent plants and shrubs. Two of the most important tree varieties are &quot;Shorea robusta&quot; (sal tree) and &quot;Tectona grandis&quot; (teak). Meghalaya is also the home to a large variety of fruits, vegetables, spices, and medicinal plants. Meghalaya is also famous for its large variety of orchids — nearly 325 of them. Of these, the largest variety is found in the Mawsmai, Mawmluh and Sohrarim forests in the Khasi hills.
Meghalaya also has a large variety of mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. The important mammal species include elephants, bear, red pandas, small Indian civets, mongooses, weasels, rodents, gaur, wild buffalo, deer, wild boar and a number of primates. Meghalaya also has a large variety of bats. The limestone caves in Meghalaya such as the Siju Cave are home to some of the nation&#x27;s rarest bat species. The hoolock gibbon is found in all districts of Meghalaya.

Common reptiles in Meghalaya are lizards, crocodiles and tortoises. Meghalaya also has a number of snakes including the python, copperhead, green tree racer, Indian cobra, king cobra, coral snake and vipers.

Meghalaya&#x27;s forests host 660 species of birds, many of which are endemic to Himalayan foothills, Tibet and Southeast Asia. Of the birds found in Meghalaya forests, 34 are on worldwide threatened species list and 9 are on the critically endangered list. Prominent birds spotted in Meghalaya include those from the families of Phasianidae, Anatidae, Podicipedidae, Ciconiidae, Threskiornithidae, Ardeidae, Pelecanidae, Phalacrocoracidae, Anhingidae, Falconidae, Accipitridae, Otididae, Rallidae, Heliornithidae, Gruidae, Turnicidae, Burhinidae, Charadriidae, Glareolidae, Scolopacidae, Jacanidae, Columbidae, Psittacidae, Cuculidae, Strigidae, Caprimulgidae, Apodidae, Alcedinidae, Bucerotidae, Ramphastidae, Picidae, Campephagidae, Dicruridae, Corvidae, Hirundinidae, Cisticolidae, Pycnonotidae, Sylviidae, Timaliidae, Sittidae, Sturnidae, Turdidae, Nectariniidae and Muscicapidae. Each of these families have many species. The great Indian hornbill is the largest bird in Meghalaya. Other regional birds found include the grey peacock pheasant, the large Indian parakeet and the common green pigeon. Meghalaya is also home to over 250 species of butterflies, nearly a quarter of all butterfly species found in India.

In 2020, scientists have discovered the largest known subterranean fish in Meghalaya&#x27;s Jaintia Hills.

Byrnihat has been ranked 38th best “National Clean Air City” under (Category 3 population under 3 lakhs cities) in India.

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===
Tribal people make up the majority of Meghalaya&#x27;s population. The Khasis are the largest group, followed by the Garos then the Jaintias. These were among those known to the British as &quot;hill tribes.&quot; Other groups include the Bengali, Hajongs, the Biates, the Koches and related Rajbongshis, the Boros, Dimasa, Kuki, Lakhar, Tiwa (Lalung), Karbi, Rabha and Nepali.

Meghalaya recorded the highest decennial population growth of 27.82% among all the seven north-eastern states, as per the provisional report of census 2011. The population of Meghalaya as of 2011 has been estimated at 2,964,007 of which females constitute 1,492,668 and males 1,471,339. As per the census of India 2011, the sex ratio in the state was 986 females per 1,000 males which was far higher than the national average of 940. The urban female sex ratio of 985 was higher than the rural sex ratio of 972.

===Religion===


Meghalaya is one of three states in India to have a Christian majority. About 75% of the population practices Christianity, with Catholics, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Church of God the more common denominations. The religion of the people in Meghalaya is closely related to their ethnicity. Close to 90% of the Garo and nearly 80% of the Khasi are Christian, while more than 97% of the Hajong, 98.53% of the Koch, and 94.60% of the Rabha tribes are Hindus. A minority of Garo and Khasi are also Hindus mainly because of the influence of Hindu populations in Hindu majority villages.

Hindus are the largest religious minority in Meghalaya with 11.52% of the total state&#x27;s population as of 2011 census Hindus are concentrated mainly in West Garo Hills, East Khasi Hills and Ri-Bhoi with 19.11 per cent, 17.55 per cent and 11.96 per cent respectively. The Nartiang Durga Temple is a major Hindu temple in Meghalaya and it is one of the 51 Shakti peethas on Earth.

Indigenous Faiths is followed by 8.7 % of population. The indigenous faiths of Meghalaya are Niamtre, followed by Jaintia people, &quot;Niam Khasi&quot; and &quot;Niam Tynrai&quot;, followed by Khasi tribe and Songsarek followed by the Garo people. 

Muslims constitute 4.39% of the population and are concentrated mainly in West Garo Hills, where they make up 16.60% of the population.

Conversion from indigenous to Christianity began in the 19th century during the British colonial era. In the 1830s, American Baptist Foreign Missionary Society had become active in Northeast India to convert indigenous tribes to Christianity. Later, they were offered to expand and reach into Cherrapunji Meghalaya, but they declined out of the lack of resources. Taking up the offer, the Welsh Presbyterian Mission began work at the Cherrapunji mission field. By the early 1900s, other Protestant denominations of Christianity were active in Meghalaya. The outbreak of World Wars forced the preachers to return home to Europe and America. It is during this period that Catholicism took root in Meghalaya and neighbouring regions. In the 20th century, Union Christian College started operations at Umiam, Shillong. Currently, Presbyterians and Catholics are two most common Christian denominations found in Meghalaya.

=== Languages ===

English is the official language of the state. The most spoken languages in Meghalaya are Khasi (33.82%) and Garo (31.60%) followed by Pnar (10.69%), Bengali (6.44%), Nepali (1.85%), War (1.73%), Hindi (1.62%), Hajong (1.40%) and Assamese (1.34%).

Khasi (also spelled Khasia, Khassee, Cossyah, and Kyi) is a branch of the Mon–Khmer family of the Austroasiatic stock and according to 2001 census, Khasi is spoken by about 1,128,575 people residing in Meghalaya. Many words in the Khasi language have been borrowed from Indo-Aryan languages such as Assamese, Bengali and Nepali. Moreover, the Khasi language originally had no script of its own. The Khasi language is one of the very few surviving Mon–Khmer languages in India today.

The Garo language has a close affinity with the Bodo languages, a small family of Tibeto-Burman languages. Garo, spoken by the majority of the population, is spoken in many dialects such as Abeng or Ambeng, Atong, Akawe (or Awe), Matchi Dual, Chibok, Chisak Megam or Lyngngam, Ruga, Gara-Ganching and Matabeng.

Pnar is spoken by many people of both the West and East Jaintia Hills. The language is related to the Khasi language. Apart from the main languages, various local dialect are being spoken by the War Jaintia (West Jaintia Hills), Maram and Lynngam (West Khasi Hills), War Pynursla (East Khasi Hills), Tiwa language by Tiwa peoples of Ri-Bhoi district. Another example is the Biate language spoken by many people inhabiting the south-eastern part of Meghalaya bordering Assam.

Indo-Aryan languages like Assamese, Bengali, Hajong, Hindi and Nepali are spoken by many people residing mostly in the East Khasi Hills district and the West Garo Hills district.

English is spoken as a common language across the diverse ethnic and demographic groups. In urban centres most of the people can speak English; rural residents vary in their ability.

The table below shows the human development index of various districts of Meghalaya, as of 2021.

==Education==
Meghalaya schools are run by the state government or by private organisations, including religious institutions. Instruction is only in English. Other Indian languages like Assamese, Bengali, Garo, Hindi, Khasi, Mizo, Nepali and Urdu are taught as optional subjects. The secondary schools are affiliated with the council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), the National Institute of Open School (NIOS) or the Meghalaya Board of School Education.

Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Meghalaya Board of School Education or any central board. Students choose from one of three streams: liberal arts, commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students may enroll in general or professional degree programs.

== Government and politics ==

Meghalaya&#x27;s Governor is C. H. Vijayashankar since July 2024.

=== State government ===
The Meghalaya Legislative Assembly has 60 members at present. Meghalaya has two representatives in the Lok Sabha, one each from Shillong and Tura. It also has one representative in the Rajya Sabha.

Since the creation of the state the Gauhati High Court has jurisdiction in Meghalaya. A Circuit Bench of the Guwahati High Court has been functioning at Shillong since 1974. In March 2013, the Meghalaya High Court was separated from the Gauhati High Court and now the state has its own High Court.

=== Local self-government ===

To provide local self-governance machinery to the rural population of the country, provisions were made in the Constitution of India; accordingly, the Panchayati Raj institutions were set up. Because of distinct customs and traditions prevalent in the northeast region, it was felt necessary to have a separate political and administrative structure in the region. Some of the tribal communities in the region had their own traditional political systems, and it was felt that Panchayati Raj institutions may come into conflict with these traditional systems. The Sixth Schedule was appended to the Constitution on the recommendations of a subcommittee formed under the leadership of Gopinath Bordoloi, and the constitution of Autonomous District Councils is provided in certain rural areas of the northeast including areas in Meghalaya.
The ADCs in Meghalaya are the following:
* Garo Hills Autonomous District Council
* Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council
* Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council

== Economy ==
Meghalaya is predominantly an agrarian economy. Agriculture and allied activities engage nearly two-thirds of the total workforce in Meghalaya. This sector&#x27;s contribution to the state&#x27;s NSDP is about one-third. Agriculture in the state is characterised by low productivity and unsustainable farm practices. Despite the large percentage of the population engaged in agriculture, the state imports food from other Indian states. Infrastructural constraints have also prevented the economy of the state from creating high-income jobs at a pace commensurate with that of the rest of India.

Meghalaya&#x27;s gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at in current prices. As of 2012, according to the Reserve Bank of India, about 12% of total state population is below the poverty line, with 12.5% of the rural Meghalaya population is below the poverty line; while in urban areas, 9.3% are below the poverty line.

=== Agriculture ===

Meghalaya is basically an agricultural state with about 80% of its population depending entirely on agriculture for their livelihood. Nearly 10% of the geographical area of Meghalaya is under cultivation. Agriculture in the state is characterised by limited use of modern techniques, low yields, and low productivity. As a result, despite the vast majority of the population being engaged in agriculture, the contribution of agricultural production to the state&#x27;s GDP is low, and most of the population engaged in agriculture remain poor. A portion of the cultivated area is under the traditional shifting agriculture known locally as &quot;Jhum cultivation&quot;.

Meghalaya produced 230,000 tonnes of food grains in 2001. Rice is the dominant food grain crop accounting for over 80% of the food grain production in the state. Other important food grain crops are maize, wheat, and a few other cereals and pulses. Besides these, potato, ginger, turmeric, black pepper, areca nut, Bay leaf (Cinnamomum tamala), betel, short-staple cotton, jute, mesta, mustard and rapeseed etc. are some of the important cash crops. Besides the major food crops of rice and maize, the state is renowned for its horticultural crops like orange, lemon, pineapple, guava, litchi, banana, jack fruits and fruits such as plum, pear, and peach.
Grains and staples production covers about 60% of the land area dedicated to crops. With the introduction of different crops of high yielding varieties in the mid-1970s, a remarkable increase in food grain production has been made. A major breakthrough was achieved when high yielding varieties of paddy such as Masuri, Pankaj IR 8, RCPL and other improved varieties series – especially IR 36 which is suitable for Rabi season – allowing three crops to be grown every year. Another milestone was reached when Megha I and Megha II, which are cold tolerant rice varieties developed by the ICAR North East Region at Umroi near Shillong, was released in 1991–92 for the higher altitude regions where there was no high yielding rice varieties earlier. Today the state can claim that about 42% area under paddy has been covered with high yielding varieties with the average productivity of . As is the case with maize and wheat where the productivity has increased tremendously with the introduction of HYV from during 1971–72 to of maize and from to of wheat.

Oilseeds such as rapeseed, mustard, linseed, soybean, castor, and sesame are grown on nearly . Rape and mustard are the most important oilseeds accounting for well over two-thirds of the oilseed production of nearly 6.5 thousand tonnes. Fiber crops such as cotton, jute, and &quot;mesta&quot; are among the only cash crops in Meghalaya, grown in Garo Hills. These have been losing popularity in recent years as indicated by their declining yield and area under cultivation.

Climatic conditions in Meghalaya permit a large variety of horticulture crops including fruits, vegetables, flowers, spices, mushrooms, and medicinal plants. These are considered to be higher value crops, but home food security concerns have prevented farmers at large from embracing them. The important fruits grown include citrus fruits, pineapples, papayas, and bananas. In addition to this, a large variety of vegetables are grown in the state, including cauliflower, cabbages, and radishes.

Areca nut plantations can be seen all over the state, especially around the road from Guwahati to Shillong. Other plantation crops like tea, coffee and cashews have been introduced lately and are becoming common. A large variety of spices, flowers, medicinal plants and mushrooms are grown in the state.

===Industry===

Meghalaya has a rich base of natural resources. These include minerals such as coal, limestone, sillimanite, Kaolin and granite among others. Meghalaya has a large forest cover, rich biodiversity, and numerous water bodies. The low level of industrialisation and the relatively poor infrastructure base acts as an impediment to the exploitation of these natural resources in the interest of the state&#x27;s economy. In recent years two large cement manufacturing plants with production capacity more than 900 MTD have come up in Jaintia Hills district and several more are in pipeline to use the rich deposit of very high-quality limestone available in this district.

===Electricity infrastructure===

Meghalaya, with its high mountains, deep gorges, and abundant rains has a large, unused hydroelectric potential. The assessed generation capacity exceeds 3000 MW. The current installed capacity in the state is 185 MW, but the state itself consumes 610 MW. In other words, it imports electricity. The economic growth of the state suggests rising demand for electricity. The state has the potential to export net hydroelectric-generated electricity and earn income for its internal development plans. The state also has large deposits of coal, thus being a candidate for thermal power plants.

Several projects are under works. The proposed Garo Hills thermal project at Nangalbibra is expected to generate an additional 751 MW of power. There is a proposal for setting up a 250 MW thermal power plant in West Khasi Hills. The State Government aims to increase its power generation output by about 2000-2500 MW, of which 700-980 MW will be thermal based while 1400-1520 MW will be hydroelectricity. The State Government has outlined a cost-shared public-private partnership model to accelerate private sector investments in its power sector. The generation transmission, transformation and distribution of electricity is entrusted to the Meghalaya Energy Corporation Limited which was constituted under the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. At present, there are five hydel power stations and one mini hydel including Umiam Hydel Project, Umtrew Hydel Project, Myntdu-Leshka-I Hydel Project, and the Sunapani Micro Hydel (SESU) Project.

For the 12th five-year plan of India, there is a proposal to set up more hydel power projects in the state: Kynshi (450 MW), Umngi −1 (54 MW), Umiam-Umtru -V (36 MW), Ganol (25 MW), Mawphu (120 MW), Nongkolait (120 MW), Nongnaw (50 MW), Rangmaw (65 MW), Umngot (260 MW), Umduna (57 MW), Myntdu-Leshka-II (60 MW), Selim (170 MW) and Mawblei (140 MW). Of these, Jaypee Group has committed itself to building the Kynshi and Umngot projects in Khasi hills.

===Education infrastructure===
Meghalaya had a literacy rate of 62.56 as per the 2001 census and is the 27th most literate state in India. This increased to 75.5 in 2011. As of 2006, the state had 5851 primary schools, 1759 middle schools, and 655 higher secondary schools respectively. In 2008, 518,000 students were enrolled in its primary schools, and 232,000 in upper primary schools. The state monitors its school for quality, access, infrastructure and teachers training.

Institution for higher studies like Indian Institute of Management, the University of Technology and Management (USTM) which is in Shillong is the first Indian university to introduce cloud computing engineering as a field of study, in collaboration with IBM and the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies. IIM Shillong is one of the top ranked management institutes in the country.

===Health infrastructure===
The state has 13 state government dispensaries, 22 community health centres, 93 primary health centres, 408 sub-centres. There were 378 doctors, 81 pharmacists, 337 staff nurses and 77 lab technicians as of 2012. A special program has been launched by the state government for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, cancer and mental diseases. Though there has been a steady decline in the death rate, improvement in life expectancy and an increase in health infrastructure, about 42.3% of the state&#x27;s population is still uncovered by health care, according to the status paper prepared by the Health Department. There are numerous hospitals being set up, both private and government, some of them are Civil Hospital, Ganesh Das Hospital, K.J.P. Synod Hospital, NEIGRIHMS, North Eastern Institute of Ayurveda &amp; Homoeopathy (NEIAH), R P Chest Hospital, Wood Land Hospital, Nazareth Hospital, Christian Hospital etc.

== Culture and society ==
The main tribes in Meghalaya are the Khasis, the Garos, and the Jaintias. Each tribe has its own culture, traditions, dress, and language.

===Social institutions===
The majority of the population and the major tribal groups in Meghalaya follow a matrilineal system where lineage and inheritance are traced through women. The youngest daughter inherits all the property and she is the caretaker of aged parents and any unmarried siblings. In some cases, such as when there is no daughter in the family or other reasons, the parents may nominate another girl such as a daughter in law as the heir of the house and all other property they may own.

The Khasi and Jaintia tribesmen follow the traditional matrilineal norm, wherein the &quot;Khun Khatduh&quot; (or the youngest daughter) inherits all the property and responsibilities for the family. The male line, particularly the mother&#x27;s brother, may indirectly control the ancestral property since he may be involved in important decisions relating to property including its sale and disposal. In case a family has no daughters, the Khasi and Jaintia (also called Syntengs) have the custom of &quot;ia rap iing&quot;, where the family adopts a girl from another family, perform religious ceremonies with the community, and she then becomes &quot;ka trai iing&quot; (head of the house).

In the Garo lineage system, the youngest daughter inherits the family property by default, unless another daughter is so named by the parents. She then becomes designated as &quot;nokna&quot; meaning &#x27;for the house or home&#x27;. If there are no daughters, a chosen daughter-in-law (&quot;bohari&quot;) or an adopted child (&quot;deragata&quot;) comes to stay in the house and inherit the property. This adopted girl child is then the head of the house.

Meghalaya has one of the world&#x27;s largest surviving matrilineal cultures.

=== Civil society ===
Meghalaya&#x27;s civil society considers the people of the state as a collective community that exists through civil society organisations (CSOs), and serves the general interests of the public. These organisations include a wide spectrum of non-government organisations (NGOs), other community associations, and foundations. The current status of Meghalaya&#x27;s civil society and the effectiveness of the many programs is debated by scholars.

There are currently over 181 NGOs within Meghalaya that vary from charities to volunteer services and social empowerment groups. Most civil society organisations are also ethnically affiliated as the interests of different groups are championed between each organisation . This in turn causes them to become representatives of ethnic communities around the state since the same individuals from such communities also participate in corresponding organisations that protect their ethnic interests. Three student organisations that represent the major ethnic groups of Meghalaya: Khasi Students&#x27; Union (KSU), Jantia Students&#x27; Union (JSU), and Garo Students&#x27; Union (GSU) embody this example into their overall functions as CSOs by applying pressure to local government in order to ensure that certain rights are being met.

There also exists many forms of community associations that revolve around the idea of community building. This includes examples such as sports, religious, educational, and other clubs that aim to establish individuals into different social circles based on their interests.

Philanthropic foundations in Meghalaya&#x27;s civil society strive for the overall well-being of its citizens. The Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) has recently partnered with the government of Meghalaya to improve public health in many rural parts of the state by first strengthening the abilities of non-government organisations to perform such services.

Scholars are divided on the effectiveness Meghalaya&#x27;s civil society. Some argue for its important role in state development through CSOs, while others point out that their impact is not only limited from above by the central government and its military, but also from below by insurgent groups .

Concerns over national security, such as the unification of neighbouring hostile countries and local insurgent groups for a possible attack on the Indian state, has served as the longstanding point of emphasis on how the Indian Central Government operates in the Northeast. Different administrative programs have been created to establish peace and stability in this region through economic development. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) that was passed in 1958 by the Indian Government granted the Indian Army exclusive powers to maintain order in this area. Many insurgent organisations were also developed alongside cultural and political movements, making it very difficult to distinguish them from what constitutes a civil society. These two factors have combined to enable CSOs to be easily deemed as insurgencies and grouped with other insurgent organisations that were banned by the government, thus restricting Meghalaya&#x27;s civil society as a whole.

=== Traditional political institutions ===
All the three major ethnic tribal groups, namely, the Khasis, Jaintias and the Garos also have their own traditional political institutions that have existed for hundreds of years. These political institutions were fairly well developed and functioned at various tiers, such as the village level, clan level, and state level.

In the traditional political system of the Khasis, each clan has its own council known as the &quot;Dorbar Kur&quot; which is presided over by the clan headman. The council or the Dorbar managed the internal affairs of the clan. Similarly, every village has a local assembly known as the &quot;Dorbar Shnong&quot;, i.e. village Durbar or council, which is presided over by the village headman. The inter-village issues were dealt with through a political unit comprising adjacent Khasi Villages. The local political units are known as the raids, under by the supreme political authority is known as the &quot;Syiemship&quot;. The Syiemship is the congregation of several raids and is headed an elected chief known as the &quot;Syiem&quot; or &quot;Siem&quot; (the king). The Siem rules the Khasi state through an elected State Assembly, known as the Durbar Hima. The Siem also has his &quot;mantris&quot; (ministers) whose counsel he would use in exercising executive responsibilities. Taxes were called &quot;pynsuk&quot;, and tolls were called &quot;khrong&quot;, the latter being the primary source of state income. In the early 20th century, Raja Dakhor Singh was the Siem of Khymir.
The Jaintias also have a three-tier political system somewhat similar to the Khasis, including the Raids and the Syiem. The raids are headed by &quot;Dolois&quot;, who are responsible for performing the executive and ceremonial functions at the Raid level. At the lowest level are the village headmen. Each administrative tier has its own elected councils or durbars.

In the traditional political system of the Garos, a group of Garo villages form the A·king. The A·king functions under the supervision of the &quot;Nokmas&quot;, which is perhaps the only political and administrative authority in the political institution of the Garos. The Nokma performs both judicial and legislative functions. The Nokmas also congregates to address inter-A·king issues. There are no well-organised councils or durbars among the Garos.

===Festivals===
;Christmas
Being a Christian majority state, Christmas is one of the biggest festivals of Meghalaya, celebrated in almost all of the parts of the state—villages, towns with great fervour and enthusiasm by native Christian Tribes. The entire state comes alive with Christmas trees, carols and lights during 25 December. Shillong and Cherrapunji are best destination for tourists who want to see and celebrate Christmas.
;Khasis
Dance is central to the culture of Khasi life, and a part of the rites of passage. Dances are performed in &quot;Shnong&quot; (village), a &quot;Raid&quot; (group of villages), and a &quot;Hima&quot; (conglomeration of Raids). Some festivals includes Ka Shad Suk Mynsiem, Ka Pom-Blang Nongkrem, Ka-Shad Shyngwiang-Thangiap, Ka-Shad-Kynjoh Khaskain, Ka Bam Khana Shnong, Umsan Nongkharai, Shad Beh Sier.

They no longer practise or observe most, except Nûlding Kût (&quot;renewal of life&quot;) every January, with singing, dancing and traditional games. A priest (thiampu) prays to Chung Pathian to bless Biates in every sphere of life.

=== Spirituality ===
In southern Meghalaya, located in Mawsynram, is the Mawjymbuin cave. Here a massive stalagmite has been shaped by nature into a Shivalinga. According to legend, from the 13th century, this Shivalinga (called &quot;Hatakeswarat&quot;) has existed in the Jaintia Hills under the reign of Ranee Singa. Tens of thousands of the Jaintia tribe members participate over the Hindu festival of Shivratri (&quot;Night of Lord Shiva&quot;) every year.

=== Living root bridges ===

The practice of creating living root bridges can be found in Meghalaya. Here, functional, living, architecture is created by slowly training the aerial roots of the Ficus elastica (rubber tree). Examples of these structures can be found as far west as the valley east of Mawsynram, and as far east as the East Jaintia Hills District, meaning that they are made by both Khasis and Jaintias. Large numbers of these man-made living structures exist in the mountainous terrain along the southern border of the Shillong Plateau, though as a cultural practice they are fading, with many individual examples having disappeared recently, either falling in landslides or floods or being replaced with more standard steel bridges.

== Transport ==
The partition of the country in 1947 created severe infrastructural constraints for the Northeastern region, with merely 2% of the perimeter of the region adjoining the rest of the country. A narrow strip of land often called the Siliguri Corridor or the Chicken&#x27;s Neck, connects the region with the state of West Bengal. Meghalaya is a landlocked state with many small settlements in remote areas. The road is the only means of transport. While the capital Shillong is relatively well connected, road connectivity in most other parts is relatively poor. A significant portion of the roads in the state is still unpaved. Most of the arrivals into the Meghalaya take place through Guwahati in neighbouring Assam, which is nearly 103 km away. Assam has a major railhead as well as an airport with regular train and air services to the rest of the country.

When Meghalaya was carved out of Assam as an autonomous state in 1972, it inherited a total road length of 2786.68 km including 174 km of National Highways with road density of 12.42 km per 100 square kilometre. By 2004, total road length has reached up to 9,350 km out of which 5,857 km were surfaced. The road density had increased to 41.69 km per 100 square kilometre by March 2011. Meghalaya is far below the national average of 75 km per 100 km2. To provide better services to the people of the state, the Meghalaya Public Works Department is taking steps for improvement and up-gradation of the existing roads and bridges in phased manner.
=== Road network ===
Meghalaya has a road network of around 7,633 km, out of which 3,691 km is black-topped and the remaining 3942 km is gravelled. Meghalaya is also connected to Silchar in Assam, Aizawl in Mizoram, and Agartala in Tripura through national highways. Many private buses and taxi operators carry passengers from Guwahati to Shillong. The journey takes from 3 to 4 hours. Day and night bus services are available from Shillong to all major towns of Meghalaya and also other capitals and important towns of Assam and the northeastern states.

=== Railway ===
Meghalaya has a railhead at and regular train service connecting Mendipathar in Meghalaya and Guwahati in Assam, has started on 30 November 2014. The Cherra Companyganj State Railways was a former mountain railway through the state. Guwahati ( from Shillong) is the nearest major railway station connecting the north-east region with the rest of the country through a broad gauge track network. There is a plan for extending the rail link from Guwahati to Byrnihat ( from Guwahati) within Meghalaya and further extending it up to state capital Shillong.

=== Aviation ===
State capital Shillong has an airport at Umroi from Shillong on the Guwahati-Shillong highway. A new terminal building was built at a cost of and inaugurated in June 2011. Air India Regional operates flights to Kolkata from this airport. There is also a helicopter service connecting Shillong to Guwahati and Tura. Baljek Airport near Tura became operational in 2008. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is developing the airport for operation of ATR 42/ATR 72 type of aircraft. Other nearby airports are in Assam, with Borjhar, Guwahati airport (IATA: GAU), about from Shillong.

== Tourism ==

Until 1955, foreign tourists required special permits to enter the areas that now constitute the state of Meghalaya, which are sometimes compared to Scotland for their highlands, fog and scenery. Meghalaya has some of the thickest primary forests in the country and therefore constitutes one of the most important ecotourism circuits in India. The Meghalaya subtropical forests support a vast variety of flora and fauna. The state has two national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries.

Meghalaya also offers many adventure tourism opportunities in the form of mountaineering, rock climbing, trekking, and hiking, caving (spelunking) and water sports. The state offers several trekking routes, some of which also afford an opportunity to encounter rare animals. The Umiam Lake has a water sports complex with facilities such as rowboats, paddleboats, sailing boats, cruise-boats, water-scooters, and speedboats.

Cherrapunji is a tourist destination in north-east of India. It lies to the south of the capital Shillong. A rather scenic 50-kilometre long road connects Cherrapunji with Shillong.

Living root bridges are also a tourist draw, with many examples located near Cherrapunji. The Double-Decker root bridge, along with several others, is found in the village of Nongriat, which is tourist friendly. Many other root bridges can be found nearby, in the villages of Nongthymmai, Mynteng, and Tynrong. Other areas with root bridges include Riwai village, near the tourist village of Mawlynnong, Pynursla, especially the villages of Rangthyllaing and Mawkyrnot, and the area around Dawki, in the West Jaintia Hills district, where there are many living root bridges scattered throughout the nearby villages.

;Waterfalls and rivers

The most visited waterfalls in the state include the Elephant Falls, Shadthum Falls, Weinia falls, Bishop Falls, Nohkalikai Falls, Langshiang Falls and Sweet Falls. The hot springs at Jakrem near Mawsynram are believed to have curative and medicinal properties.

Nongkhnum Island located in the West Khasi Hills district is the biggest river island in Meghalaya and the second biggest in Asia. It is 14 kilometres from Nongstoin. The island is formed by the bifurcation of Kynshi River into the Phanliang River and the Namliang River. Adjacent to the sandy beach the Phanliang River forms a lake. The river then moves along and before reaching a deep gorge, forms a waterfall about 60 meters high called Shadthum Fall.

;Sacred groves
Meghalaya is also known for its &quot;sacred groves&quot;. They are small or large areas of forests or natural vegetation that are usually dedicated to local folk deities or tree spirits or some religious symbolism over many generations, often since ancient times. These spaces are found all over India, are protected by local communities, and in some cases, the locals would neither touch leaves or fruits or in other ways damage the forest, flora or fauna taking refuge in them. This guardianship creates a sacred area where nature and wildlife thrive. The Mawphlang sacred forest, also known as &quot;Law Lyngdoh,&quot; is one of the most famous sacred forests in Meghalaya. It&#x27;s located about 25 kilometres from Shillong. It&#x27;s a scenic nature destination, and one can find the sacred Rudraksha tree here.

;Rural areas
Meghalaya rural life and villages offer a glimpse in northeast mountain life. The Mawlynnong village located near the India-Bangladesh border is one such village. It has been featured by travel magazine &quot;Discover India&quot;. The village is geared for tourism and has a Living Root Bridges, hiking trails and rock formations.
;Lakes
Meghalaya also has many natural and manmade lakes. The Umiam Lake (popularly known as Bara Pani meaning Big water) on the Guwahati-Shillong road is a major tourism attraction for tourist. Meghalaya has several parks; Thangkharang Park, the Eco-park, the Botanical Garden and Lady Hydari Park to name a few. Dawki, which is located at about 96 Kilometres from Shillong is the gateway to Bangladesh and affords a scenic view of some of the tallest mountain ranges in Meghalaya and the Bangladesh borderlands.

Thadlaskein Lake also &quot;Pung Sajar Nangli&quot; is the only historical Lake of Meghalaya. It is located besides National Highway 6 by the side of a small village called Mukhla village which falls under West Jaintia Hills district Jowai. It is about 35 mile from the city of Shillong

Balpakram National Park with its pristine habitat and scenery is a major attraction. The Nokrek National Park, also in Garo Hills has its own charm with a lot of wildlife.

;Caves
Meghalaya has an estimated 500 natural limestone and sandstone caves spread over the entire state including most of the longest and deepest caves in the sub-continent. Krem Liat Prah is the longest cave, and Synrang Pamiang is the deepest cave. Both are located in the Jaintia Hills. Cavers from the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Ireland, and the United States have been visiting Meghalaya for over a decade exploring these caves. Few have been developed or promoted adequately as major tourist destinations.

;Living root bridges
Meghalaya is famous for its living root bridges, a kind of suspension bridge made over rivers using intertwined roots of &quot;Ficus elastica&quot; trees planted on opposite banks of the river or hill slopes. These bridges can be seen around Cherrapunji, Nongtalang, Kudeng Rim and Kudeng Thymmai villages (War Jaintia). A double-decker bridge exists in Nongriat village.

Other important places of tourism interest Meghalaya include:
* Jakrem: 64 km from Shillong, a potential health resort having gushing hot-spring of sulphur water, believed to have curative medicinal properties.
* Ranikor: 140 km from Shillong, is one of Meghalaya&#x27;s most popular spots for angling, with an abundance of carp and other freshwater fish.
* Dawki: 96 km from Shillong, is a border town, where one can have a glimpse of the neighbouring country of Bangladesh. The colourful annual boat race during spring at the Umngot river is an added attraction.
* Kshaid Dain Thlen Falls: Located near Sohra, meaning the falls where the mythical monster of Khasi legend was finally butchered. The axe-marks made on the rocks where Thlen was butchered are stillintact and visible.
* Diengiei Peak: Located to the west of the Shillong plateau, Diengiei Peak is just 200 feet lower than Shillong peak. On the top of Diengiei, there is a huge hollow, shaped like a cup, believed to be the crater of an extinct pre-historic volcano.
* Dwarksuid: A scenic pool with wide, rocky sandbanks located on a stream alongside the Umroi-Bhoilymbong Road is known as Dwarksuid or Devil&#x27;s doorway.
* Kyllang Rock: Located about 11 kilometres off Mairang, is a several million years old steep dome of red granite rising to an elevation of about 5400 feet above sea level.
* Sacred Forest Mawphlang: One of the most celebrated sacred-groves of the State is the grove at Mawphlang about 25 kilometres off Shillong. Preserved since time immemorial, these sacred groves have wide range of flora, thick cushion of humus on the grounds accumulated over the centuries, and trees heavily loaded with epiphytic growth of aroids, pipers, ferns, fern-allies and orchids.

==Major issues==
The significant issues in the state include illegal migrants from Bangladesh, incidences of violence, political instability and deforestation from traditional cut-and-burn shift farming practices. There are several clashes between Khasi people and Bangladeshi in Meghalaya.

===Illegal immigration===
Illegal immigration has become a major issue in Indian states that surround Bangladesh – West Bengal to the west, Meghalaya and Assam to the north, and Tripura, Mizoram, and Manipur to the east. Dozens of political and civic groups have demanded that this migration be stopped or controlled to manageable levels. The border between Meghalaya and Bangladesh is about 440 kilometres long, of which some 350 is fenced; but the border is not continuously patrolled and is porous. Efforts are underway to fence it completely and introduce means to issue ID cards.

Chief Minister Mukul Sangma, in August 2012, called upon Government of India to take corrective measures to stop the illegal immigration of Bangladeshis into the northeast of the country before the situation goes out of hand.

===Violence===
Between 2006 and 2013, between 0 and 28 civilians have died per year in Meghalaya (or about 0 to 1 per 100,000 people), which the state authorities have classified as terror-related intentional violence. The world&#x27;s average annual death rate from intentional violence, in recent years, has been 7.9 per 100,000 people. The terror-related deaths are from conflicts primarily between different tribal groups and against migrants from Bangladesh. Along with political resolution and dialogue, various Christian organisations have taken the initiative to prevent violence and help the process of discussion between groups.

There have been repeated clashes with Assam e.g. Mukroh.

===Political instability===
The state has had 23 state governments since its inception in 1972, with a median life span of less than 18 months. Only three governments have survived more than three years. Political instability has affected the state&#x27;s economy in the past. Over recent years, there has been increasing political stability. The last state assembly elections were held in 2013, after a five-year government that was elected in 2008.

===Jhum farming===

Jhum farming, or cut-and-burn shift cultivation, is an ancient practice in Meghalaya. It is culturally engrained through folklores. One legend states the god of wind with the god of hail and storm shook off seeds from the celestial tree, which were picked up and sown by a bird known as &quot;do&#x27; amik&quot;. These were the seeds of rice. The god gave the human beings some of those celestial seeds, provided instruction on shift agriculture and proper rice cultivation practice, with the demand that at every harvest a portion of the first harvest must be dedicated to him. Another folktale is from the Garo Hills of Meghalaya where a man named &quot;Bone-Neripa-Jane-Nitepa&quot; harvested rice and millet from a patch of land he cleared and cultivated near the rock named &quot;misi-Kokdok&quot;. He then shared this knowledge with others, and named the different months of the year, each of which is a stage of shifting cultivation.

In modern times, shift cultivation is a significant threat to the biodiversity of Meghalaya. A 2001 satellite imaging study showed that shift cultivation practice continues and patches of primary dense forests are lost even from areas protected as biosphere. &quot;Jhum&quot; farming is a threat not only for natural biodiversity, it is also a low yield unproductive method of agriculture. It is a significant issue in Meghalaya, given majority of its people rely on agriculture to make a living. Shift farming is a practice that is not unique to northeastern Indian states such as Meghalaya, but the issue is found throughout southeast Asia.

<text>Results May Vary is the fourth studio album by American nu metal band Limp Bizkit, released on September 23, 2003, through Flip and Interscope Records. It is the band&#x27;s only release under the sole-leadership of vocalist Fred Durst after the temporary departure of guitarist Wes Borland, who left in 2001. Guitarist Mike Smith of Snot was brought in to replace Borland, although his time with the band was brief, and Durst along with a number of guests ended up handling the majority of the album&#x27;s guitar work.

The album differed from Limp Bizkit&#x27;s established sound up until that point; although the album still featured elements of hip hop and nu metal, it also branched out into other musical styles, including alternative rock, acoustic, funk and jazz. It also featured less rapping and more introspective lyrics related to heartbreak, bullying, and self-pity. An alleged affair with Britney Spears by Durst (denied by Spears) during collaborating sessions for her 2003 album &quot;In the Zone&quot; and resulting rejection by Spears was also cited as an inspiration for some of the album&#x27;s material. To promote the album, music videos featuring high-profile actors were created for &quot;Eat You Alive&quot; and a cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;; the former featuring Thora Birch and Bill Paxton and the latter featuring Halle Berry.

Upon its release, &quot;Results May Vary&quot; peaked at number 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling at least 325,000 copies in its first week of sales. While the album still eventually went platinum, both the debut and lifetime sales were still well below prior albums &quot;Significant Other&quot; (1999) and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; (2000). &quot;Results May Vary&quot; sold at least 1.3 million copies in the United States, and received mainly negative critical reception as well. &quot;Results May Vary&quot; was Limp Bizkit&#x27;s last studio album released before they went on hiatus for the three years between 2006 and 2009. 

==Background and recording==

In October 2001, Fred Durst posted on the band&#x27;s website: &quot;Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavors.&quot; Borland explained why he left Limp Bizkit; he said: &quot;I could have probably gone on and still played the part of the guitar player of Limp Bizkit, but musically I was kind of bored. If I was to continue, it would have been about the money and not about the true music, and I don&#x27;t want to lie to myself, or to them or to fans of Limp Bizkit.&quot;

According to Durst, Limp Bizkit would &quot;comb the world for the illest guitar player known to man&quot; to replace Borland. After holding a nationwide audition for a new guitarist, &quot;Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is&quot;, the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith. &quot;Mike brought in a breath of fresh air,&quot; Durst said. &quot;Creatively, it fit like a glove. It made life easier and more positive. It made us look forward to getting together as a band so much more. The positive effect he had on me just made the whole experience of Limp Bizkit feel like a brand-new entity.&quot; Before Smith replaced Borland, Durst originally attempted to write and play a great deal of the guitar tracks before resorting to hire session musician Elvis Baskette to help with writing and recording the majority of the album. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV wrote, &quot;Limp Bizkit jammed with four finalists after their much-publicized guitarist audition tour, but now it looks like Fred Durst might be taking a cue from his Puddle of Mudd pal Wes Scantlin and handling both vocal and guitar duties himself.&quot;

After a later falling-out with Smith, Durst told a fansite: &quot;We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn&#x27;t the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn&#x27;t where we needed him to be mentally.&quot; Limp Bizkit scrapped many of Smith&#x27;s sessions, recording another album that was also scrapped.

Before the introduction of &quot;Results May Vary&quot; track listing, Page Hamilton of Helmet and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer recorded songs with Limp Bizkit for the album; Al Jourgensen of Ministry also joined the band in the studio. The contributions of all three were omitted from the finished album for unknown reasons. Bubba Sparxxx joined Durst in a Los Angeles studio, but his contributions also did not make the album. Durst wrote over 30 songs with Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto and the band&#x27;s bassist, Sam Rivers. During production of &quot;Results May Vary&quot;, Durst claimed he listened to such artists as the Cure, Patsy Cline, Mazzy Star and classical music for inspiration.

===Title===
During production, the album&#x27;s title changed from &quot;Bipolar&quot; to &quot;Panty Sniffer&quot;, and then to &quot;Results May Vary&quot;. Other working titles were &quot;Less Is More&quot;, &quot;Fetus More&quot;, &quot;Surrender&quot; and &quot;The Search for Teddy Swoes&quot;. The finished product assembled songs from a number of sessions. On August 20, 2003, Fred Durst posted on the Limp Bizkit website: &quot;The album title is &quot;Results May Vary&quot;. Like a prescription drug, each persons reaction to the ingredients will be different.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Results May Vary&quot; was recorded under the leadership of Durst, who influenced a direction differing from Limp Bizkit&#x27;s established sound. Although the album features elements of rap metal and rap rock, it is noted for music experimenting with other genres: psychedelia, alternative rock, hard rock, jazz, acoustic and funk. &quot;Results May Vary&quot;, more melodic than previous Limp Bizkit albums, has been compared to John Mayer, Bon Jovi, Primus, Linkin Park, Staind and Jane&#x27;s Addiction (including the Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s album &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;). With a change in the band&#x27;s sound, &quot;Results May Vary&quot; has less rapping, more singing and more melody (including power ballads) than previous Limp Bizkit albums. &quot;The Observer&quot; called the album Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;safest, most pedestrian-sounding record yet&quot;, and Joe D&#x27;Angelo of MTV described the album as the band&#x27;s &quot;most personal album by far&quot;. According to D&#x27;Angelo, a third of the album&#x27;s content shows Durst &quot;having actual feelings other than rage, angst and conceit under his omnipresent ball cap.&quot; Durst described &quot;Results May Vary&quot; as &quot;more sad, more deep, drone-y&quot;, and the album demonstrates his &quot;milder, more sensitive streak&quot;. Although the songs on &quot;Results May Vary&quot; are emotional and expressive, screaming is largely absent from most of the songs.

Durst&#x27;s controversy with Britney Spears provided lyrical inspiration for &quot;Results May Vary&quot;. There were rumors that Durst and Spears were in a relationship. Durst wrote three songs for Spears&#x27; 2003 album &quot;In the Zone&quot;. Durst and Spears worked on those songs in a studio. After Spears denied the relationship, Durst refused to allow those three songs to appear on Spears&#x27; 2003 album &quot;In the Zone&quot;. &quot;Results May Vary&quot; features a cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; with a Speak &amp; Spell during the song&#x27;s bridge. &quot;Gimme the Mic&quot; includes lyrics from the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Pass the Mic&quot; and Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s &quot;Microphone Fiend&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Down&quot; samples Steve Miller&#x27;s &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;. &quot;Head for the Barricade&quot; borrows from the song &quot;Stick &#x27;Em&quot; by the Fat Boys. &quot;Phenomenon&quot; borrows the line, &quot;Once again back it&#x27;s the incredible&quot;, from &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; by Public Enemy. The album demonstrates Limp Bizkit&#x27;s gloomy side, with more-serious, less-confident lyrics than previous songs. Lyrical topics include bullying, Durst&#x27;s past, self-pity, betrayal, childhood pain, heartbreak, feeling misunderstood, love and Durst&#x27;s views on MTV and radio. About &quot;Down Another Day&quot;, Joe D&#x27;Angelo of MTV found it difficult to believe that lyrics that were similar to Mayer&#x27;s could come from Durst, whom, according to D&#x27;Angelo, had recently &quot;likened himself to a chainsaw and threatened to skin your ass raw&quot;. &quot;Eat You Alive&quot; was reportedly about Britney Spears (rumored to be involved in an affair with Durst) or Angelina Jolie (whom Durst admired). According to Durst, &quot;The scream in &#x27;Eat You Alive&#x27; is like an animalistic, sexual, crazy, primitive roar&quot;, and the desire which came with this behavior. Durst claimed that &quot;Just Drop Dead&quot; was not (as had been speculated) about Britney Spears, but was inspired by his experience with her and other women. Also, Durst said that &quot;Just Drop Dead&quot; is &quot;about a girl who acts like a whore&quot;. According to Durst, &quot;&#x27;Underneath the Gun&#x27; is about suicide and the struggle you can have when ending your life becomes an option&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
===Promotion===
Durst filmed music videos for &quot;Eat You Alive&quot; and &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; featuring Thora Birch and Halle Berry, respectively. The video for &quot;Eat You Alive&quot; appeared on MTV before &quot;Results May Vary&quot; was released, and the album was featured on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. Limp Bizkit were going to record a music video for &quot;Results May Vary&quot; song &quot;Build a Bridge&quot;. However, no music video for &quot;Build a Bridge&quot; was recorded. Limp Bizkit performed &quot;Crack Addict&quot; and &quot;Rollin&#x27;&quot; during WrestleMania XIX with guitarists Mike Smith and Brian Welch, and &quot;Crack Addict&quot; was played on television commercials for the event. Although &quot;Crack Addict&quot; was the planned first single from &quot;Results May Vary&quot;, the song was omitted from the album.

Released on September 23, 2003, &quot;Results May Vary&quot; peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of at least 325,000 copies in its first week of being released, ending Limp Bizkit&#x27;s number-one streak on the chart. This would also be Limp Bizkit&#x27;s 3rd and final album to enter the Top 10 of the Billboard 200. In three weeks of being released, the album had sold at least 500,000 copies. After thirteen weeks, &quot;Results May Vary&quot; sold at least 1,000,000 copies. &quot;Results May Vary&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 3, 2008 and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on October 10, 2003. &quot;Results May Vary&quot; had sales of 1,337,356 copies in the United States. The album&#x27;s cover of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; peaked at number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaked at number 25 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart, and was certified gold by the RIAA on January 26, 2005. &quot;Eat You Alive&quot; peaked at number 16 on the Mainstream Rock chart and number 20 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and &quot;Almost Over&quot; peaked at number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart, despite not receiving a single release. &quot;Results May Vary&quot; had far less mainstream success than previous Limp Bizkit albums such as &quot;Significant Other&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;. Numerous media outlets described the reception of the album as a possible &quot;career killer&quot; for Durst and the band.

===Touring===
After the release of &quot;Results May Vary&quot;, Limp Bizkit joined the band Korn on a tour called the Back 2 Basics Tour. The Back 2 Basics Tour, which was sponsored by Xbox, was scheduled for November 2003. However, during a concert at New York&#x27;s Hammerstein Ballroom, Durst was hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Durst finished the remaining two songs of Limp Bizkit&#x27;s set and after the concert, Durst had seven stitches administered by a private physician. During the end of 2003, Limp Bizkit cancelled their tour dates in Southeast Asia after there was a United States Department of State warning of increased security threats abroad. Limp Bizkit planned to play shows in Bali, Bangkok and Manila. However, after a terrorist bombing in Istanbul, Turkey occurred, the United States Department of State issued a travel advisory, and Limp Bizkit cancelled the shows in Southeast Asia. Although they did not perform in Southeast Asia, Limp Bizkit did perform in South Korea and Japan. In January 2004, there were rumors that Limp Bizkit were going to tour with the rock band Kiss, although the band was unable to, citing scheduling conflicts. Wes Borland later rejoined the band in the Spring of 2004, but rumors of tensions arising within the band were still present as American tour dates proved to be unprofitable; leading the band to take an extended European tour through most of 2004.

==Critical reception==

Critical reception of &quot;Results May Vary&quot; was mainly negative. The album holds a score of 33 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. This is the third lowest score on Metacritic, above The Bloodhound Gang&#x27;s &quot;Hefty Fine&quot; and Kevin Federline&#x27;s album &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [and] all attention is focused on the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you&#x27;re left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?&quot;. In a review of Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hitz&quot; compilation, Erlewine called &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; the worst in the band&#x27;s &quot;never-ending series of embarrassing covers&quot;. Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Durst&#x27;s problems are ever-present—and does anybody still care?&quot;. &quot;Stylus&quot; criticized &quot;Results May Vary&quot;, calling it &quot;an album that can only be described as abysmal&quot;. Rob O&#x27;Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized &quot;Results May Vary&quot;: &quot;No, Fred, the results don&#x27;t vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy.&quot; Kitty Empire of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn&#x27;t have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &#x27;other side&#x27;, you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back&quot;. Scott Mervis of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; also criticized &quot;Results May Vary&quot;: &quot;&quot;Results May Vary&quot; has a few highlights—&#x27;Almost Over&#x27; (very Everlast) and &#x27;Phenomenon&#x27; (very Primus)—but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent&quot;.

Although &quot;Results May Vary&quot; received primarily negative reviews, according to &quot;Spin&quot;, the album &quot;isn&#x27;t all that horrible&quot;. Some others were not so negative towards &quot;Results May Vary&quot;. Tom Day of MusicOMH wrote, &quot;Ultimately, this album is neither crap nor blindingly good, and results do indeed vary&quot;. The &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; gave &quot;Results May Vary&quot; a positive review, calling Lethal&#x27;s work &quot;phenomenal&quot;, and praising &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; and the soft-to-heavy progression of &quot;Build a Bridge&quot;. Steve Appleford of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave &quot;Results May Vary&quot; a mixed review, writing: &quot;The music achieves some surprising sophistication with new textures both acoustic and electronic. Durst also is not so obnoxious nearly so often; at the same time, his songs too often lack the harsh melodic spark that once turned his ravings into pop hits&quot;.

<text>The goblet drum (also chalice drum, tarabuka, tarabaki, darbuka, darabuka, derbake, debuka, doumbek, dumbec, dumbeg, dumbelek, toumperleki, tumbak, or zerbaghali; / Romanized: ) is a single-head membranophone with a goblet-shaped body. It is most commonly used in the traditional music of Egypt, where it is considered the national symbol of Egyptian Shaabi Music. The instrument is also featured in traditional music from West Asia, North Africa, South Asia, and Eastern Europe. The West African djembe is also a goblet membranophone. This article focuses on the Middle Eastern and North African goblet drum.

==History==
The origin of the term &quot;Darbuka&quot; lies in the rural Egyptian Arabic slang word that changed &quot;darb&quot; meaning &quot;to strike&quot; into &quot;darabuka&quot;.

Goblet drums have been around for thousands of years and were used in Mesopotamian and Ancient Egyptian cultures.
They were also seen in Babylonia and Sumer from as early as 1100 BCE. On Sulawesi, large goblet drums are used as temple instruments and placed on the floor when played, which may reflect ancient use of the drum.

==Technique==

The &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;North-African&quot; goblet drums are played under the arm or resting on the player&#x27;s leg, with a much lighter touch and quite different strokes (sometimes including rolls or quick rhythms articulated with the fingertips) to hand drums such as the djembe, found in West Africa.

There are two main types of goblet drums. The Egyptian style, Darbuka, is also known as Tabla and is very popular; it has rounded edges around the head, whereas the Turkish style exposes the edge of the head. The exposed edge allows closer access to the head so finger-snapping techniques can be done, but the hard edge discourages the rapid rolls possible with the Egyptian style.

The goblet drum may be played while held under one arm (usually the non-dominant arm) or by placing it sideways upon the lap (with the head towards the player&#x27;s knees) while seated. Some drums are also made with strap mounts so the drum may be slung over the shoulder, to facilitate playing while standing or dancing. It produces a resonant, low-sustain sound while played lightly with the fingertips and palm. Some players move their fists in and out of the bell to alter the tone. Some players also place their hands on the surface of the drum to produce a muted sound. There are a variety of rhythms (see dumbek rhythms) that form the basis of the folkloric and modern music and dance styles of the Middle East.

There are three main sounds produced by the goblet drum. The first is called a &quot;doom&quot;. It is the deeper bass sound produced by striking the head near the center with the length of the fingers and palm and taking off the hand for an open sound. The second is called the &quot;tak&quot; and is the higher-pitched sound produced by hitting near the edge of the head with the fingertips. A &quot;tak&quot; struck with the secondary hand is also known as a &quot;ka&quot;. The third is the closed sound &quot;pa&quot; (also called &quot;sak&quot;), for which the hand is briefly rested on the head so as not to permit an open sound. Additionally, there are more complex techniques including snaps, slaps, pops and rolls that are used to ornament the basic rhythm. Hand clapping and hitting the sides of the drum can be used in addition to drumhead sounds.

Another technique commonly used in Greece, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania and Turkey is to tap with the fingers of one hand and with a thin drum stick in the other.
In Turkey the stick is called the &quot;çubuk&quot;, which means &quot;wand&quot;, or stick, and where the Romanis there occasionally use this technique.

==Use in Western classical music==
The first known Western classical composition to feature a goblet drum is the opera &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (1856–1858) by the French composer Hector Berlioz, which calls for a &quot;tarbuka&quot; in the Dance of the Nubian Slaves in Act IV.

The first compositions for goblet drum and orchestra were composed by the Egyptian-American musician Halim El-Dabh in the 1950s; his &quot;Fantasia-Tahmeel&quot; for goblet drum and strings was premiered in New York City in 1958, with a string orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski.

<text>The dholak is a two-headed hand drum, a folk percussion instrument. The dholak is most commonly recognised in countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, but can also be found amongst the Indo-Diaspora in countries such as Guyana, Suriname, Fiji, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa and Mauritius. The dholak can be anywhere about 16&quot; to 24&quot; in length. It is widely used in &quot;qawwali&quot;, &quot;kirtan&quot;, &quot;bhajan&quot;, &quot;bhangra&quot;, &quot;chutney&quot;, &quot;baithak gana&quot;, &quot;Bollywood film songs&quot;, &quot;lokgeet&quot; and various classical styles such as &quot;Hindustani&quot;, &quot;Carnatic&quot; and &quot;Trinidadian local classical / Guyanese taan&quot;. The drum has two different sized drumheads. There is a smaller drumhead that can be from 5.5 to 8 inches in diameter and is made for sharp notes while the bigger drumhead, which can be from 7.5 to 10 inches in diametre, is made for low pitch. The two drumheads allow a combination of bass and treble with rhythmic high and low pitches. The body or shell of the Dholak can made of sheesham or mango wood. The larger drum head has a compound of tar, clay and sand, called &quot;masala&quot; which is applied to lower the pitch and produce the sound. The smaller drumhead is played with the person&#x27;s dominant hand, while the larger is played by the person&#x27;s weaker hand. A dholak can either be fitted with a nuts and bolts or a rope and steel rings for tuning. Commonly in the Indian subcontinent, there are only one set of rings for tuning the treble side of the dholak, while in the Caribbean (&quot;Trinidad&quot;, &quot;Guyana&quot; and &quot;Suriname&quot;), hook screws are placed into the sides of the dholak to allow tuning of both the treble and the bass. Dholak can be played in three ways — on the player’s lap, while standing, or pressed down with one knee while sitting on the floor.

==Construction==
The smaller surface of the dholak is made of goat skin for sharp notes and the bigger surface is made of buffalo skin for low pitches, which allows a combination of bass and treble with rhythmic high and low pitches.

The shell is sometimes made from sheesham wood &quot;(Dalbergia sissoo)&quot; but cheaper dholaks may be made from any wood, such as mango. In Sri Lanka, the Dholak has been borrowed from India and has only seen some popularity there in recent times .
==Usage==
It is widely used in qawwali, kirtan, lavani and bhangra. It was formerly used in classical dance. Indian children sing and dance to it during pre-wedding festivities. It is often used in &quot;Filmi Sangeet &quot;(Indian film music), in chutney music, chutney-soca, baitak gana, &quot;taan&quot; singing, bhajans, and the local Indian folk music of Jamaica, Suriname, Guyana, Caribbean, South Africa, Mauritius, and Trinidad and Tobago, where it was brought by indentured immigrants. In the Fiji Islands the dholak is widely used for Indian folk music, bhajan and kirtan.

The dholak&#x27;s higher-pitched head is a simple membrane while the bass head, played usually with the left hand, has a compound syahi to lower the pitch and enable the typical Dholak sliding sound (&quot;giss&quot; or &quot;gissa&quot;), often the caked residue of mustard oil pressing, to which some sand and oil or tar may be added. 
==Playing style==

The drum is either played on the player&#x27;s lap or, while standing, slung from the shoulder or waist or pressed down with one knee while sitting on the floor.

In some styles of playing (such as Punjab) an iron thumb ring is used to produce a distinctive &quot;chak&quot; rim sound. In other styles (such as Rajasthani), all fingers are generally used.

Dholak masters are often adept at singing or chanting and may provide primary entertainment or lead drumming for a dance troupe. Perhaps the most characteristic rhythm played on the dhol is a quick double-dotted figure that may be counted in rhythmic solfege as &quot;one -&quot;tah&quot; and -&quot;tah&quot; two -&quot;tah&quot; and -&quot;tah&quot; three-&quot;e&quot; -&quot;tah&quot;, four and &quot; (rest on &quot;and&quot;) or simply a long string of double-dotted notes, over which the bass side is used for improvisation.

On large dholaks, known as dhols, the high-pitched head may be played using a thin (1/4&quot; / 6 mm or less) long (over 14&quot; / 30 cm) stick of rattan or bamboo (rattan is preferred for its flexibility) and the low-pitched drum head using a somewhat thicker, angled stick.

==Variants==
The &quot;dholki&quot; (Hindi/Urdu: pipe or tube) is often a bit narrower in diameter and uses tabla-style syahi masala on its treble skin. This instrument is also known as the &quot;naal&quot;. Its treble skin is stitched onto an iron ring, similar to East Asian Janggu or Shime-daiko drums, which tenses the head before it is fitted. The bass skin often has the same structure as in ordinary dholak, being fitted on to a bamboo ring, but sometimes they have a &quot;kinar&quot; and pleated Gajra, as seen in tabla, to withstand the extra tension. 

Similar drums with similar names are found elsewhere in Western Asia.

<doc id="326044" wikidata="Q391421" url="?curid=326044" title="Slender-billed gull">
<text>The slender-billed gull (Chroicocephalus genei) is a mid-sized gull which breeds very locally around the Mediterranean and the north of the western Indian Ocean (e.g. Pakistan) on islands and coastal lagoons. Most of the population is somewhat migratory, wintering further south to as far as North Africa and India. A few birds have wandered to western Europe. A vagrant individual was reportedly seen on Antigua, April 24, 1976 (AOU, 2000).

The genus name &quot; Chroicocephalus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;khroizo&quot;, &quot;to colour&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;. The specific &quot;genei&quot; commemorates Italian naturalist Giuseppe Gené.

==Description==
This species is long with a wingspan. It is therefore slightly larger than the black-headed gull, which it resembles, although it does not have a black hood in summer. It has a pale grey body, white head and breast and black tips to the primary wing feathers. The head and dark red bill have an elongated tapering appearance, and this bird also appears long-necked. The legs are dark red, and the iris is yellow. In summer, the breast has a faint pink colouration. This bird takes two years to reach maturity, as is usual in gulls. First year immature birds have a black terminal tail band, and dark areas on the wings.
==Distribution and habitat==
The slender-billed gull breeds in lagoons and lakes around the Mediterranean Sea and in similar locations in countries bordering the northwestern part of the Indian Ocean. In 2010 a successful colony was found breeding on an island in a mountain lake in Algeria. The lack of predators and disturbance allowed over 98% of the eggs to hatch. It overwinters on the coast in estuaries and bays. It feeds in deltas, marshes and grassland. It is one of a number of species of gull to feed on landfill sites.

==Behaviour==

About half of the slender-billed gull&#x27;s food is fish. It flies a few metres above the surface of the water and dives into the water when it sees suitable prey. It also probes in the mud with its beak to feed on marine invertebrates and catches insects in flight.

This rather uncommon gull breeds in colonies, nesting on the ground and laying up to three brown-spotted white eggs in a scrape sparsely lined with feathers and bits of vegetation. Incubation takes about 25 days and the young fly after another 25 days. Like most gulls, it is gregarious in winter, both when feeding and in evening roosts. It is not a pelagic species, and is rarely seen far from land.

==Status==
The slender-billed gull is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Lakshmi Sahgal () (born Lakshmi Swaminathan; 24 October 1914 – 23 July 2012) was a revolutionary of the Indian independence movement, an officer of the Indian National Army, and the Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs in the Azad Hind government. Lakshmi is commonly referred to in India as Captain Lakshmi, a reference to her rank when taken prisoner in Burma during the Second World War.

==Early life==

Captain Lakshmi was born on 24 October 1914 to S. Swaminathan, a lawyer who practiced criminal law at Madras High Court, and A.V. Ammukutty, better known as Ammu Swaminathan, a social worker and independence activist from an aristocratic Nair family known as &quot;Vadakkath&quot; family of Anakkara, Ponnani taluk, Malabar District, British India. She is the elder sister of Mrinalini Sarabhai.

Lakshmi studied in Queen Mary&#x27;s College and later chose to study medicine and received an MBBS degree from Madras Medical College in 1938. A year later, she received her diploma in gynaecology and obstetrics. She worked as a doctor in the Government Kasturba Gandhi Hospital located at Triplicane Chennai.

In 1940, she left for Singapore after the failure of her marriage to pilot P.K.N. Rao. During her stay at Singapore, she met some members of Subhas Chandra Bose&#x27;s Indian National Army.

===The Azad Hind Fauj===
In 1942, during the surrender of Singapore by the British to the Japanese, Lakshmi aided wounded prisoners of war, many of whom were interested in forming an Indian independence army. Singapore at this time had several nationalist Indians working there including K. P. Kesava Menon, S. C. Guha and N. Raghavan, who formed a Council of Action. Their Indian National Army, or &quot;Azad Hind Fauj&quot;, however, received no firm commitments or approval from the occupying Japanese forces regarding their participation in the war.

It was against this backdrop that Subhash Chandra Bose arrived in Singapore on 2 July 1943, and reorganized the movement. Lakshmi Sahgal wrote later: “At the second mass meeting, Netaji dropped a bombshell by saying that it was his intention to form a women&#x27;s infantry regiment, named after the Rani of Jhansi who had fought so heroically against the British in 1857… I told him I was ready to join... The date was July 8, 1943”. Women responded enthusiastically to join the all-women brigade and Dr. Lakshmi Swaminathan became Captain Lakshmi, a name and identity that would stay with her for life.

Captain Lakshmi was the Minister in Charge of Women&#x27;s Organization in the Provisional Government of Free India led by Subash Chandra Bose in Singapore.

The INA marched to Burma with the Japanese army in December 1944, but by March 1945, with the tide of war turning against them, the INA leadership decided to beat a retreat before they could enter Imphal. Captain Lakshmi was arrested by the British in May 1945, remaining in Burma until March 1946, when she was sent to India – at a time when the INA trials in Delhi heightened popular discontent with and hastened the end of colonial rule.

==Later years==
In 1971, Lakshmi joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist). During the Bangladesh crisis, she organised relief camps and medical aid in Calcutta for refugees who streamed into India from Bangladesh. She was one of the founding members of All India Democratic Women&#x27;s Association in 1981 and led many of its activities and campaigns. She led a medical team to Bhopal after the gas tragedy in December 1984, worked towards restoring peace in Kanpur following the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and was arrested for her participation in a campaign against the Miss World competition in Bangalore in 1996. She was still seeing patients regularly at her clinic in Kanpur in 2006, at the age of 92.

In 2002 Indian presidential election, four leftist partiesthe Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Revolutionary Socialist Party, and the All India Forward Blocnominated Sahgal as a candidate in the presidential elections. She was the sole opponent of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who emerged victorious.

==Personal life==
Lakshmi married Prem Kumar Sahgal in March 1947 in Lahore. After their marriage, they settled in Kanpur, where she continued with her medical practice and aided the refugees who were arriving in large numbers following the Partition of India. They had two daughters: Subhashini Ali and Anisa Puri.

Subhashini is a prominent communist politician and labour activist. According to Ali, Lakshmi was an atheist. The filmmaker Shaad Ali is her grandson.

==Death==
On 19 July 2012, Sahgal had a cardiac arrest and died on 23 July 2012 at 11:20 A.M. at the age of 97 at Kanpur. Her body was donated to Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College for medical research.

==Awards==
In 1998, Sahgal was awarded the Padma Vibhushan by Indian president K. R. Narayanan. In 2010, she was bestowed with honorary doctorate by University of Calicut.

==In popular culture==
Rajeshwari Sachdev played the role of Captain Sahgal in 2004 film &quot;Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero&quot;. Shruthi Seth played the role of Sahgal in 2020 Amazon Prime Video series &quot;The Forgotten Army - Azaadi Ke Liye&quot;.

<doc id="326067" wikidata="Q1264" url="?curid=326067" title="U Thant">
<text>Thant ( ; 22 January 1909 – 25 November 1974), known honorifically as U Thant (), was a Burmese diplomat and the third secretary-general of the United Nations from 1961 to 1971, the first non-Scandinavian as well as Asian to hold the position. He held the office for a record 10 years and one month.

A native of Pantanaw, Thant was educated at the National High School and at Rangoon University. In the days of tense political climate in Burma, he held moderate views positioning himself between fervent nationalists and British loyalists. He was a close friend of Burma&#x27;s first Prime Minister U Nu and served in various positions in Nu&#x27;s cabinet from 1948 to 1961. Thant had a calm and unassuming demeanor that won his colleagues&#x27; respect.

He succeeded James Barrington as the Permanent Representative to the United Nations. He was appointed Secretary-General in 1961, six weeks after his predecessor, Dag Hammarskjöld, had died in an air crash. In his first term, Thant facilitated negotiations between U.S. president John F. Kennedy and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, helping to avert a global catastrophe. Later, in December that year, Thant ordered Operation Grandslam, which ended a secessionist insurgency in Congo. He was reappointed as Secretary-General on 2 December 1966, by a unanimous vote of the Security Council. During his second term Thant was well known for publicly criticizing U.S. conduct in the Vietnam War. He oversaw the entry of several newly independent African and Asian states into the UN. He refused to serve a third term, and retired in 1971.

Thant died of lung cancer in 1974. A devout Buddhist and the foremost Burmese diplomat on the international stage, he was widely admired and held in great respect by the Burmese populace. When the military government refused him any honours, riots erupted in Rangoon; these were violently crushed by the government, leaving scores of casualties. The Deputy Minister of Education, who paid respect to U Thant’s body at the Mingalardon air port, was forced to resign. 

A book about ဦးသန့်အရေးအခင်း had to wait a few decades before publication. 

== Early life ==
Thant, the eldest of four sons, was born in Pantanaw, Colonial Burma, to a moderately-wealthy family of landowners and rice merchants. His father Po Hnit, who had been educated in Calcutta, was the only person in the town who could communicate well in English. He was a founding member of the Burma Research Society and had helped establish &quot;The Sun&quot; (&quot;Thuriya&quot;) newspaper in Rangoon. Although his family members were ethnic Bamars and devout Buddhists, Thant&#x27;s father, according to Thant Myint-U (U Thant&#x27;s grandson), had distant ancestors who were &quot;people from both India and China, Buddhists and Muslims, as well as Shans and Mons&quot;. He hoped that all his four sons would each earn a degree. His other sons, Khant, Thaung, and Tin Maung went on to become politicians and scholars.

Po Hnit had collected a personal library of various American and British books and cultivated a reading habit among his children. As a result, Thant became an avid reader and his school friends nicknamed him &quot;The Philosopher&quot;. Apart from reading, he enjoyed various sports including hiking, swimming and playing chinlone. He went to the National High School in Pantanaw. At the age of eleven Thant participated in strikes against the University Act of 1920. He dreamed of becoming a journalist and surprised the family by writing an article for the &quot;Union of Burma Boy Scouts&quot; magazine. When Thant was fourteen, his father died and a series of inheritance disputes forced Thant&#x27;s mother, Nan Thaung, and her four children into difficult financial times.

After the death of his father, Thant believed he would not be able to complete a four-year degree and instead worked for a two-year teaching certificate at Rangoon University in 1926. As the eldest son he had to fulfill his filial duties and responsibilities to the family. At university, Thant, together with future Prime Minister Nu studied history under D. G. E. Hall. Nu was told by a distant mutual relative to take care of Thant and the two soon became close friends. Thant was elected joint secretary of the University Philosophical Association and secretary of the Literary and Debating Society. In Rangoon, Thant met J.S. Furnivall, the founder of The Burma Book Club and &quot;The World of Books&quot; magazine, to which Thant regularly contributed. Promising a good post, Furnivall urged Thant to complete a four-year university course and join the Civil Service, but Thant refused. After earning the certificate, he returned to Pantanaw to teach at the National High School as a senior teacher in 1928. He contacted Furnivall and Nu regularly, writing articles and participating in &quot;The World of Books&quot; translation competitions.

In 1931, Thant won first place in All Burma Teachership Examination and became the school&#x27;s headmaster by the age of twenty-five. Urged by Thant, his friend Nu took the local superintendent of schools position. Thant regularly contributed to several newspapers and magazines under the pen name &quot;Thilawa&quot; and translated a number of books, including one on the League of Nations. His major influences were Sir Stafford Cripps, Sun Yat-sen and Mahatma Gandhi. In the days of tense political climate in Burma, Thant stood moderate grounds between fervent nationalists and British loyalists.

== Civil servant ==

During World War II, the Japanese occupied Burma from 1942 to 1945. They brought Thant to Rangoon to lead the Educational Reorganizing Committee. However, Thant did not have any real power, and returned to Pantanaw. When teaching the Japanese language was made compulsory in Pantanaw high schools, Thant defied the orders and cooperated with the growing anti-Japanese resistance.

In 1948, Burma gained independence from the United Kingdom. Nu became the prime minister of the newly independent Burma and appointed Thant as director of broadcasting in 1948. By then, civil war had broken out. The Karen insurgency began and Thant risked his life to go to Karen camps to negotiate for peace. The negotiations broke down, and in 1949 the advancing insurgents burned his hometown, including his house. The insurgents pushed the front to within four miles of the capital Rangoon before they were beaten back. In the following year, Thant was appointed secretary to the government of Burma in the Ministry of Information. From 1951 to 1957, Thant was secretary to the prime minister, writing speeches for U Nu, arranging his foreign travel, and meeting foreign visitors. During this entire period, he was U Nu&#x27;s closest confidant and advisor.

He also took part in a number of international conferences and was the secretary of the 1955 Bandung Conference in Indonesia, which gave birth to the Non-Aligned Movement. From 1957 to 1961, he was Burma&#x27;s permanent representative to the United Nations and became actively involved in negotiations over Algerian independence. In 1961, Thant was named Chairman of the UN Congo Commission. The Burmese government awarded him the title &quot;Maha Thray Sithu&quot; as a commander in the order of Pyidaungsu Sithu.

In September 1961, United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash &quot;en route&quot; to Congo. Within two weeks, the United States and the Soviet Union had agreed to appoint Thant as the Acting Secretary-General for the remainder of Hammarskjöld&#x27;s term. However, the two superpowers spent another four weeks arguing over the details of his appointment. On 3 November 1961, the Security Council recommended Thant in Resolution 168, and the General Assembly voted unanimously to appoint Thant to a term of office ending on 10 April 1963.

During his first term, he was widely credited for his role in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis and for ending the civil war in the Congo. He also said that he wanted to ease tensions between major powers while serving at the UN.

=== First term: Cuban Missile Crisis ===

In less than one year in office, Thant faced a critical challenge to defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis, the moment when the world came closest to a nuclear war. On 20 October 1962, two days before public announcements were made, U.S. president John F. Kennedy showed Thant U-2 aerial reconnaissance photographs of Soviet missile installations in Cuba. The president then ordered a naval &quot;quarantine&quot; to remove all offensive weapons from Soviet ships bound for Cuba. Meanwhile, Soviet ships were approaching the quarantine zone. To avoid a naval confrontation, Thant proposed that the U.S. should make non-invasion guarantees in exchange for missile withdrawal from the Soviet Union. Soviet Premier Khrushchev welcomed the proposal, which formed the basis of further negotiations. Khrushchev further agreed to suspend missile shipments while the negotiations were ongoing. However, on 27 October 1962, a U-2 plane was shot down over Cuba, deepening the crisis. Kennedy was under intense pressure to invade from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Executive Committee (ExComm). Kennedy hoped Thant would play the role of mediator and subsequently replied to ExComm and the Joint Chiefs, &quot;On the other hand we have U Thant, and we don&#x27;t want to sink a ship...right in the middle of when U Thant is supposedly arranging for the Russians to stay out.&quot;

Negotiations continued. The U.S. agreed to dismantle missiles in Turkey and guaranteed never to invade Cuba in exchange for removal of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Thant flew to Cuba and discussed with Fidel Castro allowing UN missile inspectors and the return of the body of the downed U-2 pilot. Castro, furious that the Soviets had agreed to remove missiles without his knowledge, categorically rejected any UN inspectors, although he did return the pilot&#x27;s body. The inspection was done at sea by US reconnaissance aircraft and warships. The crisis was resolved and a war between superpowers was averted.

=== Continuation of first term: War in the Congo ===

Thant&#x27;s reappointment was assured when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev made several favorable references to Thant in letters to U.S. president John F. Kennedy. In November 1962, the General Assembly voted unanimously to promote Thant from Acting Secretary-General to Secretary-General for a term ending on 3 November 1966. For personal reasons, Thant wanted his term to end five years from his initial appointment, and he would henceforth consider his first five years in office to be a single term.

Although a manifest pacifist and a devout Buddhist, Thant did not hesitate to use force when required. During the Congo Civil War in 1962, Katangan secessionists led by Moise Tshombe repeatedly attacked UN Operation in the Congo forces (ONUC). In December 1962, after ONUC suffered a sustained four-day attack in Katanga, Thant ordered the &quot;Operation Grandslam&quot; to gain &quot;complete freedom of movement for ONUC all over Katanga.&quot; The operation proved to be decisive and ended the secessionist insurgency once and for all. By January 1963, the secessionist capital Elizabethville was under full UN control. In his speech at Columbia University Thant expressed expectation of completion of the United Nations Operation in the Congo in mid 1964.

For his role in defusing the Cuban crisis and other peacekeeping efforts, the Norwegian Permanent Representative of the United Nations informed Thant that he would be awarded the 1965 Nobel Peace Prize. He humbly replied, &quot;Is not the Secretary-General merely doing his job when he works for peace?&quot; On the other hand, Chairman Gunnar Jahn of the Nobel Peace Prize committee lobbied heavily against giving Thant the prize, which was, at the last minute, awarded to UNICEF. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to Thant. The disagreement lasted three years, and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to Thant. Outraged, Thant&#x27;s undersecretary and Nobel Prize laureate Ralph Bunche called Gunnar Jahn&#x27;s decision &quot;gross injustice to U Thant.&quot;

In April 1964, Thant accepted the Holy See&#x27;s designation of itself as a UN permanent observer. There appeared to be no involvement of the General Assembly or the UN Security Council in the decision.

=== Second term: Arab–Israeli conflict and Vietnam War===
Thant announced in 1966 that he would not stand for a second term, but he accepted a draft when the Security Council assured him that he would not be a &quot;glorified clerk.&quot; On 2 December 1966, the General Assembly re-appointed Thant to a term ending on 31 December 1971, on the unanimous recommendation of the Security Council. During his second term, he oversaw the entry into the UN of dozens of new Asian and African states, and was a firm opponent of apartheid in South Africa. He also established many of the UN&#x27;s development and environmental agencies, funds and programmes, including the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN University, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), and the UN Environmental Programme. The Six-Day War between Arab countries and Israel, the Prague Spring and subsequent Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the Indo–Pakistani War of 1971 leading to the birth of Bangladesh all took place during his tenure as secretary-general.

He was criticized in the US and Israel for agreeing to pull UNEF troops out of the Sinai in 1967 in response to a request from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The Permanent Representative of Egypt had informed Thant that the Egyptian government had decided to terminate UNEF&#x27;s presence in the Sinai and the Gaza Strip, and requested steps that would withdraw the force as soon as possible, which Thant was obligated to accept. The UN afterwards stated, &quot;Because Israel refused to accept UNEF on its territory, the Force had to be deployed only on the Egyptian side of the border, and thus its functioning was entirely contingent upon the consent of Egypt as the host country. Once that consent was withdrawn, its operation could no longer be maintained.&quot; Thant, by flying to Cairo in a last-minute peace effort, tried to persuade Nasser not to go to war with Israel.

In Israel, his abrupt unilateral withdrawal of UNEF without any diplomatic process or wider consultation was regarded as a violation of United Nations assurances and commitments given to Israel in 1957, on the basis of which Israel had withdrawn from Sinai and Gaza at that time, and it &quot;thereafter inspired Israel&#x27;s refusal to place her vital interests again in United Nations hands&quot;.

Thant&#x27;s once good relationship with the US government deteriorated rapidly when he publicly criticized American conduct of the Vietnam War. His secret attempts at direct peace talks between Washington and Hanoi were eventually rejected by the Johnson administration.

In 1971, the participation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the United Nations, which was a long-standing problem, was realized. Thant sent a message to the Chinese government asking China to send a delegation.

=== Retirement ===

On 23 January 1971, Thant announced that he would &quot;under no circumstances&quot; be available for a third term as secretary-general. The 1971 United Nations Secretary-General selection was delayed by the anticipated arrival of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the Security Council did not begin voting until two weeks before the end of Thant&#x27;s term. After every candidate was vetoed in the second round, Kurt Waldheim accidentally won in the third round when the United States, United Kingdom, and China failed to coordinate their vetoes and all abstained.

Unlike his two predecessors, Thant retired after ten years on speaking terms with all the big powers. In 1961, when he was first appointed, the Soviet Union tried to insist on a &quot;troika&quot; formula of three secretaries-general, one representing each Cold War bloc, to maintain equality in the United Nations between the superpowers. By 1966, when Thant was reappointed, all the big powers, in a unanimous vote of the Security Council, affirmed the importance of the secretary-generalship and his good offices, a clear tribute to Thant&#x27;s work.

In his farewell address to the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary-General Thant stated that he felt a &quot;great sense of relief bordering on liberation&quot; on relinquishing the &quot;burdens of office&quot;. In an editorial published around 27 December 1971, praising Thant, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;the wise counsel of this dedicated man of peace will still be needed after his retirement&quot;. The editorial was titled &quot;The Liberation of U Thant&quot;.

After his retirement, Thant was appointed a senior fellow of the Adlai Stevenson Institute of International Affairs. He spent the last years of his life writing and advocating the development of a true global community and other general themes he had tried to promote while he was secretary-general. While serving as secretary-general, Thant lived in Riverdale, Bronx, on a estate near 232nd Street, between Palisade and Douglas Avenues.

== Death and legacy ==
Thant died of lung cancer at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York on 25 November 1974. By then, Burma was ruled by a military junta, which refused him any honours. Burmese president Ne Win was supposedly envious of Thant&#x27;s international stature and the respect that was accorded him by the Burmese populace. 

However, Thant&#x27;s grandson, Thant Myint-U, wrote in the book &quot;The River of Lost Footsteps: Histories of Burma&quot; that intense animosity between Thant and Ne Win went back only to 1969, when Ne Win believed Thant was conniving with Nu after Nu denounced Ne Win at a press corps meeting at the UN headquarters. Ne Win told his men to consider Thant as an enemy of the state, despite Thant denouncing Nu&#x27;s action as inappropriate.

Ne ordered for Thant to be buried without any official involvement or ceremony.
From the United Nations headquarters in New York where he was laid in state, Thant&#x27;s body was flown back to Rangoon, but no guard of honour or high-ranking officials were on hand at the airport when the coffin arrived except for U Aung Tun, deputy minister of education, who was subsequently dismissed from office. On the day of Thant&#x27;s funeral on 5 December 1974, tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Rangoon to pay their last respects. Thant&#x27;s coffin was displayed at Rangoon&#x27;s Kyaikasan race course for a few hours before the scheduled burial. The coffin of Thant was then snatched by a group of students just before it was scheduled to leave for burial in an ordinary Rangoon cemetery at Kyandaw. The student demonstrators buried Thant on the former grounds of the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU), which Ne Win had dynamited and destroyed on 8 July 1962.

During the period of 5–11 December, the student demonstrators also built a temporary mausoleum for Thant on the grounds of the RUSU and gave anti-government speeches. In early morning on 12 December 1974, government troops stormed the campus, killed some of the students guarding the makeshift mausoleum, removed Thant&#x27;s coffin, and reburied it in Kandawmin Garden Mausolea near the Shwedagon Pagoda, where it has continued to lie. Upon hearing of the storming of the Rangoon University campus and the forcible removal of Thant&#x27;s coffin, many people rioted in the streets of Rangoon. Martial law was declared in Rangoon and the surrounding metropolitan areas. What has come to be known as the U Thant crisis, the student-led protests over the shabby treatment of Thant by the Ne Win government, was crushed by the Burmese government.

In April 2012, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon paid his respects at U Thant&#x27;s mausoleum during a visit to Yangon.

U Thant is held in esteem in Malaysia, as he helped to endorse the formation of the country in 1963.

== Personal life ==

Thant had three brothers: Khant, Thaung, and Tin Maung. He was married to Daw Thein Tin. They had two sons and a daughter, but lost both sons; Maung Bo died in infancy, and Tin Maung Thant fell from a bus during a visit to Yangon. Tin Maung Thant&#x27;s funeral procession, which was attended by dignitaries, was grander than that of the state funeral of Commodore Than Pe, a member of the 17-man Revolutionary Council and minister of health and education. Thant was survived by a daughter, an adopted son, five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren (three girls and two boys). His only grandson, Thant Myint-U, is a historian and a former senior official in the UN&#x27;s Department of Political Affairs and the author of &quot;The River of Lost Footsteps&quot;, in part a biography of Thant.

== Awards, honors, and memorials ==
Thant was generally reluctant to receive prizes and honors due to his own humility as well as publicity associated with them. He declined Burma&#x27;s second highest honor awarded to him by U Nu&#x27;s government in 1961. When he was informed that the 1965 Nobel Prize would instead go to UNICEF due to Chairman Gunnar Jahn&#x27;s veto, Thant, according to Walter Dorn, &quot;recorded his pleasure&quot;. However, he did accept the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1965 and the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1973.

Thant received honorary degrees (LL.D) from Carleton University, Williams College, Princeton University, Mount Holyoke College, Harvard University, Dartmouth College, University of California at Berkeley, University of Denver, Swarthmore College, New York University, Moscow University, Queen&#x27;s University, Colby College, Yale University, University of Windsor, Hamilton College, Fordham University, Manhattan College, University of Michigan, Delhi University, University of Leeds, Louvain University, University of Alberta, Boston University, Rutgers University, University of Dublin (Trinity College), Laval University, Columbia University, the University of the Philippines Diliman, and Syracuse University. He also received the Doctor of Divinity from The First Universal Church; Doctor of International Law from Florida International University; Doctor of Laws from University of Hartford; Doctor of Civil Laws degree, honoris causa from Colgate University; Doctor of Humane Letters from Duke University.

In his memory, Sri Chinmoy, the leader of the UN Meditation Group founded by Thant, established the U Thant Peace Award which acknowledges and honors individuals or organizations for distinguished accomplishments toward the attainment of world peace. The meditation team also named a tiny island in the East River opposite the headquarters of the United Nations U Thant Island. The road Jalan U-Thant (U-Thant Road) and the township Taman U-Thant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia are also named in his honor.

In December 2013, in an effort spearheaded by his daughter Aye Aye Thant and his grandson Thant Myint-U, Thant&#x27;s house in Yangon was being converted into a museum which would feature his photos, works and personal belongings. In October 2013, the building of an U Thant library near his Pantanaw house was underway.

<text>Empresas Polar is a Venezuelan corporation that started as a brewery, founded in 1941 by Lorenzo Alejandro Mendoza Fleury, Juan Simon Mendoza, Rafael Lujan and Karl Eggers in Antímano &quot;La Planta de Antimano&quot;, Caracas. It is the largest and best known brewery in Venezuela, but has since long diversified to an array of industries, mostly related to food processing and packaging, also covering markets abroad.
==Products==

===Original line===
Production of &quot;Cerveza Polar&quot;, a 5% abv lager began during the 1940s, and eventually, the company grew into the largest beer producing company in Venezuela, producing also Solera, Solera Light, Polar Light, Polar Ice, Polar Zero and Polar Zilch. The name comes from the polar bear, whose image is imprinted on the beer bottles. Maltin Polar “energia natural y full sabor”, is another of their most famous products, a Malta, similar to a nonalcoholic ale style beer, suited for all ages.

===Beers===
The company produces five different brands of lager with slight variations in abv strength and taste, such as &quot;Solera&quot; at 6% abv, called Verde (green) because of its bottle color, &quot;Polar Pilsen&quot; at 5% abv, called Negra (black) or Negrita (Blackie), &quot;Solera Light&quot; at 4.3% abv, called Azul (Azulita), &quot;Polar Ice&quot; at 4.5% abv, &quot;Polar Light&quot; at 4% abv. There is also a nonalcoholic beer called &quot;Polar Zilch&quot;.

Polar&#x27;s signature Pilsen product started distribution in the United States in 1985 under the leadership of Carlos Eduardo Stolk, President and Chairman of the Board of Empresas Polar for over 30 years.

Their non-alcoholic product aimed at the youth market, Maltin Polar, is basically a type of soft drink called Malta which is similar to ale beers with hops but with some caramel flavouring. Its taste is comparable to that of a dark, very sweet beer.

==Economic crisis==
During the economic crisis in Venezuela in 2016 production of beer was suspended due to the firm&#x27;s inability to access a supply of barley.

===Other products===
The company has diversified its range of products, mainly by acquiring other companies and now also produces snacks, maize flour (which is the base for the main Venezuelan meals), ice-creams (Helados Efe), soft drinks and malt beverages (Cervecería Polar, Refrescos Golden and bottles Pepsi-Cola and Diet Pepsi for the Venezuelan and North Andean market). Polar also bought the food manufacturer Mavesa, which produces mayonnaise, ketchup, margarine and a blue biodegradable soap (Las Llaves). The company also set a joint venture with the French cognac manufacturer Martell in the state of Lara to produce wines locally. The company&#x27;s name is Bodegas Pomar.

Polar is currently trying to expand their frontiers, by exporting some of their products to other countries, currently some Polar products can be purchased in the United States of America. Maltin Polar, Polar Beer and Harina PAN. Recently the &quot;Maltin Polar&quot; and &quot;Polar ICE&quot; have been introduced into the Puerto Rican market.

<doc id="326074" wikidata="Q273607" url="?curid=326074" title="Ferdinand Buisson">
<text>Ferdinand Édouard Buisson (; 20 December 1841 – 16 February 1932) was a French educational bureaucrat, pacifist, and Radical-Socialist (left liberal) politician. He presided over the League of Education from 1902 to 1906 and over the Human Rights League (LDH) from 1914 to 1926. In 1927, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to him jointly with Ludwig Quidde. A philosopher and educator, he was Director of Primary Education. He was the author of a thesis on Sebastian Castellio, in whom he saw a &quot;liberal Protestant&quot; in his image. Ferdinand Buisson was the president of the National Association of Freethinkers. In 1905, he chaired the parliamentary committee to implement the separation of church and state. Famous for his fight for secular education through the League of Education, he coined the term &quot;laïcité&quot; (&quot;secularism&quot;).

== Biography ==

Ferdinand Buisson was a student at the Lycée Condorcet, then received his &quot;aggrégation&quot; in philosophy. A historical figure of liberal Protestantism, he voluntarily went into exile in Switzerland under the Second Empire, from 1866 to 1870, because he refused to swear allegiance to the new government.

== Career ==
Buisson was a professor at what became the University of Neuchâtel. Beginning in 1867, he attended three international conferences of the League of Peace and Freedom. At the last congress in Lausanne in 1869, he read a speech. Meanwhile, he tried to put in place a liberal Protestant church, calling pastors Jules Steeg and Felix Pécaut. After the announcement of the proclamation of the Republic, he returned to France and was actively involved in political and social initiatives of the municipality of 17th arrondissement. In December 1870, he became head of the 17th arrondissement municipal orphanage, the first secular orphanage, which later became the Seine orphanage. Refusing to teach philosophy because he was more willing to work for the poorest children, it was thanks to his friendship with the Minister of Public Instruction, Jules Simon, that he was appointed director of the Paris schools. Concerned about the future of the children in the orphanage, he connected with the philanthropist Joseph Gabriel Prevost and placed the children in his Prévost orphanage in Cempuis. In 1880, he appointed Paul Robin director of the orphanage.

From 1879 to 1896, Buisson was called by Jules Ferry, the successor of Jules Simon, the Directorate of Primary Education. In 1890, he became professor of education at the Sorbonne. He supervised the work of writing and designing the laws of secularism. In 1905, he was the chairman of the parliamentary committee that wrote the text of the law of separation of church and state. In 1898, as a supporter of Alfred Dreyfus, Buisson participated in the creation of the French League for Human Rights, which he was president from 1913 to 1926. Deputy of the Seine from 1902 to 1914, then from 1919 to 1924, he was a particularly strong advocate of vocational education and compulsory voting rights for women.

Buisson was sympathetic to women&#x27;s suffrage, unlike most Radicals, and was rapporteur of the committee that examined the proposal of Paul Dussaussoy for limited women&#x27;s suffrage. The bill was pushed to the bottom of the agenda of the committee on voting rules. The President of the committee judged it important to separate the question of votes for women from the more important question of proportional representation, which was considered first. Buisson submitted a separate report on women&#x27;s suffrage on 16 July 1909, some months after Dussaussoy&#x27;s death. Buisson&#x27;s report supported the proposal.

In 1914 and during the World War I, Buisson was one of the patriots and defended the Sacred Union. He was elected again from 1919 to 1924, and worked for Franco-German reconciliation, especially after the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923. An early supporter of the League of Nations, he invited German pacifists to Paris and travels to Berlin.

Ferdinand Buisson was also the prime contractor for a remarkable editorial project, the &quot;Dictionnaire de pédagogie et d&#x27;instruction primaire&quot;, for the writing of which he surrounded himself with more than 350 collaborators, and more particularly with James Guillaume who became its editor-in-chief. The first edition was published by Hachette between 1882 and 1887. A new edition was published in 1911. Not limited to the role of editorial responsibility, Buisson wrote entries such as Secularism, Intuition, and Prayer. His dictionary is considered the &quot;Bible&quot; of the secular, republican school system, and introduced the concept of a secular religious replacement. The Minister of Education, Vincent Peillon, was one of his disciples. A supporter from the beginning of the League of Nations, Buisson then devoted himself to Franco-German rapprochement, especially after the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, inviting German pacifists to Paris and traveling to Berlin. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1927 with the German professor Ludwig Quidde.

<text>Javier Felipe Ricardo Pérez de Cuéllar de la Guerra ( , ; 19 January 1920 – 4 March 2020) was a Peruvian diplomat and politician who served as the fifth secretary-general of the United Nations from 1982 to 1991. He later served as prime minister of Peru from 2000 to 2001.

Pérez de Cuéllar was a member of the Club of Madrid, a group of former heads of state and government, and the Inter-American Dialogue.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Pérez de Cuéllar was born on 19 January 1920 in Lima, Peru, to a rentier family of Spanish descent with ancestry from Cuéllar. His father, whose ancestors had migrated from Spain in the 16th century, died when he was 4. He attended Colegio San Agustín, learned French from a governess and earned a law degree from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in 1943.

===Diplomatic career===
Pérez de Cuéllar joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1940 first as an intern, the diplomatic service itself in 1944, serving after that as a 3rd Secretary at Peru&#x27;s embassy in France, where he met and married his first wife, Yvette Roberts-Darricau (1922–2013), in 1947. He also held posts in Britain, Bolivia and Brazil, and later served as ambassador to Switzerland from 1964 to 1966, the Soviet Union and Poland from 1969 to 1971, and Venezuela from 1977 to 1979. From his first marriage, he had a son, Francisco, and a daughter, Águeda Cristina.

He was a member of the Peruvian delegation to the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, which convened in London in 1946, and of the delegations to the 25th through 30th sessions of the Assembly. In 1971, he was appointed permanent representative of Peru to the UN and led his country&#x27;s delegation in the Assembly until 1975.

In 1973 and 1974, he represented Peru in the UN Security Council, serving as its president at the time of the Cypriot coup d&#x27;état in July 1974. On 18 September 1975, he was appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Cyprusa post he held until December 1977, when he rejoined Peru&#x27;s foreign service. Also in 1975, Pérez de Cuéllar divorced his first wife and married Marcela Temple Seminario (1933–2013), with whom he had no children.

On 27 February 1979, he was appointed UN under-secretary-general for Special Political Affairs. From April 1981, he also acted as the Secretary-General&#x27;s personal representative on the situation in Afghanistan; he visited Pakistan and Afghanistan in April and August of that year to continue negotiations initiated by the Secretary-General some months earlier.

===United Nations Secretary-General===
In December 1981, Pérez de Cuéllar was selected to succeed Kurt Waldheim as Secretary-General of the United Nations; he was unanimously re-elected for a second term in October 1986.

During his two terms as secretary-general, he led mediations between the United Kingdom and Argentina in the aftermath of the Falklands War and promoted the efforts of the Contadora group to bring peace and stability to Central America. He also interceded in the negotiations for the independence of Namibia, the conflict in Western Sahara, the war between Croatian forces seeking independence and the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (as well as the local Serb forces), and the Cyprus issue. In 1986 he presided over an international arbitration committee that ruled on the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; incident between New Zealand and France. In 1983, he initiated the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) to unite countries to pursue sustainable development. During the build-up to the Gulf War, he convinced US president George H. W. Bush to send his secretary of state James Baker to negotiate with Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz in Geneva.

Shortly before the end of his second term, he rejected an unofficial request by members of the Security Council to reconsider his earlier decision not to run for a third term, shortened to two years, as a search for his successor had not, as of then, yielded a consensus candidate. A suitable candidate, Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, was agreed upon in November 1991, and Pérez de Cuéllar&#x27;s second term as secretary-general concluded, as scheduled, on 31 December 1991.

===Later life and death===

Pérez de Cuéllar ran unsuccessfully against Alberto Fujimori for president of Peru in 1995; following Fujimori&#x27;s resignation over corruption charges, he served as prime minister and foreign minister from November 2000 until July 2001. After Alejandro Toledo&#x27;s election as president in 2001, he went to Paris as Peru&#x27;s ambassador to France, retiring in 2004.

In 1997, Pérez de Cuéllar published his memoir in which he recounted his years at the UN. He served as Permanent Delegate of Peru to UNESCO until 2004.

Pérez de Cuéllar celebrated his 100th birthday in January 2020 and received congratulations from the United Nations on his 100 years of life. He was the first UN secretary-general to become a centenarian. 

Pérez de Cuéllar died at his home in Lima on 4 March 2020 two months after he turned 100.

<doc id="326081" wikidata="Q315048" url="?curid=326081" title="Edmond Becquerel">
<text>Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel (; 24 March 1820 – 11 May 1891), known as Edmond Becquerel, was a French physicist who studied the solar spectrum, magnetism, electricity and optics. In 1839, he discovered the photovoltaic effect, the operating principle of the solar cell, which he invented in the same year. He is also known for his work in luminescence and phosphorescence. He was the son of Antoine César Becquerel and the father of Henri Becquerel, the discoverer of radioactivity.

== Biography ==
Becquerel was born in Paris and was in turn the pupil, assistant and successor of his father at the Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle. He was also appointed professor at the short-lived Agronomic Institute at Versailles in 1849, and in 1853 received the chair of physics at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. He was associated with his father in much of his work.

== The first photovoltaic device ==

In 1839, at age 19, experimenting in his father&#x27;s laboratory, Becquerel created the world&#x27;s first photovoltaic cell. In this experiment, silver chloride or silver bromide was used to coat the platinum electrodes; once the electrodes were illuminated, voltage and current were generated. Because of this work, the photovoltaic effect has also been known as the &quot;Becquerel effect&quot;.

== Photographic discoveries ==

Becquerel was an early experimenter in photography. In 1840, he discovered that the silver halides, natively insensitive to red and yellow light, became sensitive to that part of the spectrum in proportion to their exposure to blue, violet and ultraviolet light, allowing daguerreotypes and other photographic materials to be developed by bathing in strong red or yellow light rather than by chemical treatment. In practice this technique was rarely used. In 1848 he produced color photographs of the solar spectrum, and also of camera images, by a technique later found to be akin to the Lippmann interference method, but the camera exposures required were impractically long and the images could not be stabilized, their colors persisting only if kept in total darkness, however this work is based on the discoveries of J. T. Seebeck prior to 1810.

== Other studies ==

Becquerel paid special attention to the study of light, investigating the photochemical effects and spectroscopic characters of solar radiation and the electric arc light, and the phenomena of phosphorescence, particularly as displayed by the sulfides and by compounds of uranium. It was in connection with these latter inquiries that he devised his phosphoroscope, an apparatus which enabled the interval between exposure to the source of light and observation of the resulting effects to be varied at will and accurately measured.

He investigated the diamagnetic and paramagnetic properties of substances and was keenly interested in the phenomena of electrochemical decomposition, accumulating much evidence in favor of Faraday&#x27;s law of electrolysis and proposing a modified statement of it which was intended to cover certain apparent exceptions.
In 1853, Becquerel discovered thermionic emission.

== Publications ==

In 1867 and 1868 Becquerel published &quot;La lumière, ses causes et ses effets&quot; (&quot;Light, its Causes and Effects&quot;), a two-volume treatise which became a standard text. His many papers and commentaries appeared in French scientific journals, mainly the French Academy of Science&#x27;s widely distributed &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot;, from 1839 until shortly before his death in 1891.

== Honors and awards ==

Becquerel was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1886.

The Becquerel Prize for &quot;outstanding merit in photovoltaics&quot; is awarded annually at the European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition (EU PVSEC).

<doc id="326086" wikidata="Q1128460" url="?curid=326086" title="Contadora group">
<text>The Contadora Group was an initiative launched in the early 1980s by the foreign ministers of Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela to deal with the Central American crisis (military conflicts in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala), which were threatening to destabilize the entire Central American region.

The original stimulus for the initiative was a call by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and Nobel laureates Gabriel García Márquez, Alfonso García Robles and Alva Myrdal for the presidents of Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and Panama
to act as mediators in the conflicts.

The group first met on Contadora Island (Panama) in 1983.
The initiative drew international attention to Central America&#x27;s conflicts and pressured for a softening of the militarist stance of the United States in the region.
The peace plan was supported by the United Nations Security Council, the General Assembly and many regional and international bodies.

In September 1983, mediated by the Contadora group, the foreign ministers of the Central American countries adopted a Document of Objectives in Panama City. 
This document declared their intent to promote democratization and to end armed conflict in the region, to act in compliance with international law, to revitalize and restore economic development and co-operation in Central America, and to negotiate better access to international markets.

A year later, in September 1984, the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America was also presented. 
This document included a range of detailed commitments to peace, democratization, regional security and economic co-operation. 
It also provided for regional committees to evaluate and verify compliance with these commitments.

The following year, representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay met in Lima and created the Contadora support group.

The Contadora Act was tentatively approved by the Central American presidents, but did not gain the crucial backing of the United States due to its &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the government of Nicaragua. The United States was also not supportive of the plan because it prohibited unilateral action by the US in protection of its interests. Moreover, the US succeeded in blocking in the plan any recourse to the World Court and United Nations as required by international law.

A revised version of the accord failed to assuage the objections raised and was finally laid to rest with its formal rejection by Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras in June 1986.

While the Contadora group ultimately failed to establish a credible peace formula with the backing of all regional governments, it did lay the foundations for such a plan to emerge in subsequent years. 
Under the leadership of Costa Rican president Óscar Arias, the so-called Esquipulas Peace Agreement emerged from the remains of Contadora in 1986 and led to a fundamental reshaping of Central American politics.

<text>Ashton-Tate Corporation was a US-based software company best known for developing the popular dBASE database application and later acquiring Framework from the Forefront Corporation and MultiMate from Multimate International. It grew from a small garage-based company to become a multinational corporation. Once one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; software companies, which included Microsoft and Lotus, the company stumbled in the late 1980s and was sold to Borland in September 1991.

== History ==
The history of Ashton-Tate and dBASE are intertwined and as such, must be discussed in parallel.

=== Early history: dBASE II (1981–1983) ===
In 1978, Martin Marietta programmer Wayne Ratliff wrote Vulcan, a database application, to help him make picks for football pools. Written in Intel 8080 assembly language, it ran on the CP/M operating system and was modeled on JPLDIS, a Univac 1108 program used at JPL and written by fellow programmer Jeb Long. Ashton-Tate was launched as a result of George Tate and Hal Lashlee having discovered Vulcan from Ratliff in 1981 and licensing it (Ashton was Tate&#x27;s after-the-fact parrot, whose cage was kept in his Culver City office) The original agreement was written on one page, and called for simple, generous royalty payments to Ratliff.

Tate and Lashlee had already built three successful start-up companies, by that time - spring 1981. 

The three companies were: 
# Discount Software Group, one of the first companies to sell microcomputer software through the mail. 
# Software Distributors, aka Softeam (Glenn Johnson /CEO Mark Vidovich). 
# Softwaire Centre International, the Original Software Store and franchised retail chain. 
The first Software Store opened in May 1981. It was located on W. Pico Blvd, Los Angeles. 
Johnson&#x27;s concept of retail store that sold software only, is the foundational retail concept of today&#x27;s Apple &amp; Google&#x27;s App Stores.

By August 1984, SCI had grown to 113 stores, in 32 states. 

Glenn Johnson was Co-Founder, C.E.O., and Chairman Of The Board of Directors of Softwaire Centre International. Tate &amp; Lashlee were co-investors. 

SCI was later sold to Wayne Green Publishing, publisher of &quot;Byte Magazine&quot;.

Vulcan was sold by SCDP Systems. The founders needed to change the name of the software, because Harris Corporation already had an operating system called Vulcan. Hal Pawluk, who worked for their advertising agency, suggested &quot;dBASE&quot;, including the capitalisation. He also suggested that the first release of the product &quot;II&quot; would imply that it was already in its second version, and therefore would be perceived as being more reliable than a first release. The original manual was too complex from Pawluk&#x27;s perspective, so he wrote a second manual, which was duly included in the package along with the first. Pawluk created the name for the new publishing company by combining George&#x27;s last name with the fictional Ashton surname, purportedly because it was felt that &quot;Ashton-Tate&quot; sounded better, or was easier to pronounce, than &quot;Lashlee-Tate&quot;.

dBASE II had an unusual guarantee. Customers received a crippleware version of the software and a separate, sealed disk with the full version; they could return the unopened disk for a refund within 30 days. The guarantee likely persuaded many to risk purchasing the $700 application. In 1981 the founders hired David C. Cole to be the chairman, president and CEO of their group of companies. The group was called &quot;Software Plus&quot;. It did not trade under its own name, but was a holding company for the three startups: Discount Software, Software Distributors, and Ashton-Tate. Cole was given free rein to run the businesses, while George Tate primarily remained involved in Ashton-Tate. Lashlee was somewhat less involved on a day-to-day basis in Ashton-Tate by this time, although he was always aware of and up to speed on all three of the businesses, and was an active board member and officer of SPI.

In June 1982 Cole hired Rod Turner as the director of OEM sales for Ashton-Tate. In a few weeks Turner solved a sales commission plan issue, that had been bothering George Tate for some time, with the top performing salesperson (Barbara Weingarten-Guerra), and Tate and Cole promoted Turner to be Vice President of world-wide sales three weeks after his initial hire. Turner was approximately the 12th employee of Ashton Tate. Since the company was truly boot-strapped, using no external venture capital, the founders did not make a practice of hiring experienced veterans, and most of the team at Ashton-Tate were young and enthusiastic, but inexperienced. Jim Taylor was responsible for product management in the early days, and worked closely with Wayne Ratliff and the other key developers on dBASE II. In 1982 Perry Lawrence and Nelson Tso were the two developers who were employed at Ashton-Tate, while Wayne Ratliff employed Jeb Long from his royalty stream.

=== IBM PC ===
dBASE II was ported to the IBM PC (i.e. the MS-DOS operating system) and shipped in September 1982. Pawluk ran advertisements promoting dBASE II for the IBM PC for months before it shipped. When dBASE II for the IBM PC shipped, it was one of few major applications available on the PC, and that fact, combined with good promotion and sales in the US and internationally, caused dBASE II sales to grow rapidly. Turner expanded Ashton-Tate&#x27;s international distribution efforts and encouraged exclusive distributors in major markets to translate dBASE II from English to non-English versions. The early presence of dBASE II in international markets, as IBM rolled out the PC in those markets, facilitated rapid growth in sales and market share for dBASE. At one point in 1983, the company&#x27;s French distributor &quot;La Commande Electronique&quot; (whose owner was Hughes LeBlanc) claimed that &quot;one in ten buyers of a PC in France is buying dBASE II.&quot;

In the winter of 1982, Turner recruited the managing director (David Imberg, now David Inbar) for Ashton-Tate&#x27;s first subsidiary, Ashton-Tate UK. Turner set a goal for Inbar of achieving 15% per month compound revenue growth in the first 18 months (using the prior UK distributor&#x27;s volume as a starting point), which Inbar accomplished. He subsequently expanded Ashton-Tate&#x27;s operations across Europe with subsidiaries in Germany and the Netherlands. When Turner brought Inbar to the Culver City, California, corporate headquarters of Ashton-Tate to be trained, the offices were so crowded that the only space available for Inbar was a small desk beside a large photocopier, with no phone line; the offices were so crowded that when Turner needed to conduct a confidential meeting, he would have it standing up in the nearby restroom.

With the growing popularity of ever-larger hard drives on personal computers, dBASE II turned out to be a huge seller. For its time, dBASE was extremely advanced. It was one of the first database products that ran on a microcomputer, and its programming environment (the dBASE language) allowed it to be used to build a wide variety of custom applications. Although microcomputers had limited memory and storage at the time, dBASE nevertheless allowed a huge number of small-to-medium-sized tasks to be automated. The value-added resellers (VARs) who developed applications using dBASE became an important early sales channel for dBASE.

By the end of the fiscal year ending in January 1982, the firm had revenues of almost $3.7 million with an operating loss of $313,000.

Among Cole&#x27;s early acts was to hire an accountant to set up a financial system, install a management structure, and introduce processes to manage operations and orders. Cole&#x27;s mission was &quot;to shift the balance of power from those who understand how computers work to those who need what computers can do.&quot;

Cole licensed two products in 1982, building on his publishing background. These two unsuccessful products were launched in October 1982: The Financial Planner and The Bottom Line Strategist. The Financial Planner was a sophisticated financial modeling system that used its own internal language - but it was not as widely appealing as spreadsheets like SuperCalc. The Bottom Line Strategist was a template financial analysis system that had very limited flexibility and function. Both were released at the same price as dBASE II, but neither product was aggressively marketed, and both were put into a benign-neglect mode by Turner when it became clear that they did not have sizable potential.

=== Ashton-Tate: IPO and dBASE III (1983–1985) ===
By the end of January 1983, the company was profitable. In February 1983 the company released dBASE II RunTime, which allowed developers to write dBASE applications and then distribute them to customers without them needing to purchase the &quot;full&quot; version of dBASE. The growth in revenue was matched by a growth in employees. The company hired its first Human Resources manager, put together its first benefits package, and moved headquarters to 10150 West Jefferson Boulevard in Culver City.

In May 1983 Cole changed the name of the SPI holding company to be Ashton Tate, which put the company in the position of having a mail order company &quot;Discount Software&quot; and &quot;Software Distributors&quot; as subsidiaries. The newly renamed holding company promptly sold Discount Software and Software Distributors. Cole negotiated an agreement with Wayne Ratliff in which Ratliff exchanged his future royalty stream on dBASE into equity in Ashton Tate, thereby significantly increasing the profitability of the company.

Cole also took steps to control its technology by creating an in-house development organization (headed by Harvey Jean, formerly of JPL, as VP engineering), and to diversify by funding two outside development teams: Forefront Corporation (the developer of the product that would later be named &quot;Framework&quot;) and Queue Associates. That Spring, Ashton Tate released Friday!. By the time of the November 1983 IPO, the company had grown to 228 employees. The IPO raised $14 million. When the fiscal year ended in January 1984, revenues had more than doubled to $43 million and net income had jumped from $1.1 million (fiscal 1983) to $5.3 million.

By early 1984 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; estimated that Ashton-Tate was the world&#x27;s sixth-largest microcomputer-software company. dBASE II reportedly had 70% of the microcomputer-database market, with more than 150,000 copies sold. Ashton-Tate published a catalog listing more than 700 applications written in the language, and more than 30 book, audio, video, and computer tutorials taught dBASE. Other companies produced hundreds of utilities that worked with the database, which Ratliff believed contributed to Ashton-Tate&#x27;s success; &quot;You might say it&#x27;s because the software is incomplete. There are &#x27;problems&#x27; with dBASE—omissions for other software developers to fill&quot;. He noted that &quot;If they weren&#x27;t with us, they&#x27;d be against us&quot;, and Cole promised to always notify third parties before announcing a new product or changing dBase&#x27;s marketing. In May the company announced, and in July shipped, dBASE III as the successor to dBASE II. July also saw the release of Framework, an integrated office suite developed by Forefront Corporation and funded by Ashton-Tate. These were the company&#x27;s first products released with copy protection schemes in an attempt to stop software piracy.

dBASE III was the first release written in the C programming language to make it easier to support and port to other platforms. To facilitate the rewrite, an automatic conversion program was used to convert the original Vulcan code from CP/M Z-80 and DOS 8088 assembly language code into C, which resulted in the beginnings of a difficult to maintain legacy code base that would haunt the company for many years to come. This also had the side effect of making the program run somewhat slower, which was of some concern when it first shipped. As newer machines came out the problem was erased through increased performance of the hardware, and the &quot;problem&quot; simply went away.

In fall 1984 the company had over 500 employees and was taking in $40 million a year in sales (with approximately $15 million in Europe), the vast majority of it from dBASE or related utilities.

=== Ed Esber ===
Ashton Tate held a large company wide convention aboard the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach, California, in early August, 1984 and presented the new products like Friday! to hundreds of clients, and staff. Immediately after the Queen Mary convention, George Tate suddenly died of a heart attack at the age of 40 on August 10, 1984. David Cole on October 29 announced his resignation and left for Ziff-Davis, leaving Ed Esber to become CEO. Cole hired Esber because he was the marketing expert who launched VisiCalc and who built the first distribution channels for personal computer software. (VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet and is credited for sparking the personal computer revolution and was the first commercially successful personal computer software package.)

During Esber&#x27;s seven-year tenure, Ashton Tate had its most prosperous years and a few of its most controversial. It is also when Ashton-Tate became one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; personal computer software companies who had weathered the early 1980s &quot;shakeout&quot;, and was considered an equal of Microsoft and Lotus Development. Under his leadership Ashton-Tate sales grew over 600% from $40M to over $318M.

In November, shortly after Esber took over, dBASE III version 1.1 was released to correct some of the numerous bugs found in the 1.0 release. As soon as the 1.1 release shipped, development focus turned to the next version, internally referred to as dBASE III version 2.0. Among other things, the 2.0 release would have a new kernel for increased speed, and new functions to improve application development.

Esber&#x27;s relationship with Wayne Ratliff, however, was tumultuous, and Ratliff quit several months later. Eventually a group of sales and marketing employees left to join Ratliff at Migent Corporation to compete with Ashton Tate. Later (January 1987), Ashton-Tate would sue Migent for alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. Ratliff would eventually approach Esber about rejoining Ashton-Tate and insisting on reporting directly to him. Jeb Long took over as dBASE&#x27;s main architect in Ratliff&#x27;s absence.

In October 1985 the company released dBASE III Developer&#x27;s Edition. Internally this release was known as version 1.2. It had some of the new features expected to be in the upcoming 2.0 release, including the new kernel and features primarily useful to application developers. Version 1.2 was one of the most stable dBASE versions that Ashton-Tate ever released, if not &quot;the&quot; most stable. It was also one of the least known and most often forgotten. Mostly, it was a release to appease developers waiting for 2.0 (dBASE III+).

In late 1985 the company moved its headquarters to the final location at 20101 Hamilton Avenue in Torrance. Development was spread throughout California, although dBASE development was centered at the Glendale offices.

=== dBASE III+ and third party clones (1986–1987) ===
dBASE III+, a version including character-based menus for improved ease-of-use, had troubles maturing and had to be recalled just prior to its release in early 1986 due to an incorrect setting in the copy-protection scheme. However the company handled this with some aplomb, and although some customers were affected, Ashton-Tate&#x27;s handling of the problems did much to improve customer relations rather than sour them. dBASE III+ would go on to be just as successful as dBASE II had been, powering the company to $318 million in sales in 1987.

dBASE had grown unwieldy over the years, so Esber started a project under Mike Benson to re-architect dBASE for the new world of client–server software. It was to be a complete rewrite, designed as the next generation dBASE.

dBASE was a complex product, and a thriving third-party industry sprung up to support it. A number of products were introduced to improve certain aspects of dBASE, both programming and day-to-day operations. As Ashton-Tate announced newer versions of dBASE, they would often decide to include some of the functionality provided by the third parties as features of the base system. Predictably, sales of the third-party version would instantly stop, whether or not the new version of dBASE actually included that feature. After a number of such vaporware announcements, third-party developers started becoming upset.

One particularly important addition to the lineup of third-party add-ons was the eventual release of dBASE compilers, which would take a dBASE project and compile it and link it into a stand-alone runnable program. This not only made the resulting project easy to distribute to end users, but it did not require dBASE to be installed on that machine. These compilers essentially replaced Ashton-Tate&#x27;s own solution to this problem, a $395 per-machine &quot;runtime&quot; copy of dBASE, and thereby removed one source of their income. The most successful such compiler was Clipper, from Nantucket Software. Eventually a number of these were developed into full-blown dBASE clones.

Esber was upset with the companies that cloned dBASE products but was always supportive of third-party developers, whom he viewed as an important part of the dBASE ecosystem. He neither believed nor supported companies that cloned dBASE, in the process leveraging the millions of dollars his shareholders had paid to market dBASE. Starting with minor actions, he eventually went to great lengths to stop cloners with cease-and-desist letters and threats of legal action. At one industry conference he even stood up and threatened to sue anyone who made a dBASE clone, shouting &quot;Make my day!&quot;. This sparked great debates about the ownership of computer languages and chants of &quot;innovation not litigation&quot;.

As a result of this continued conflict, the third-party community slowly moved some of their small business customers away from dBASE. Fortunately for Ashton-Tate, large corporations were standardizing on dBASE.

=== dBASE IV: Decline and fall (1988–1990) ===
Ashton-Tate had been promising a new version of the core dBASE product line starting around 1986. The new version was going to be more powerful, faster, and easier to create databases with. It would have improved indexes and networking, support SQL internally as well as interacting with SQL Server, and include a compiler. Ashton-Tate announced dBASE IV in February 1988 with an anticipated release set for July of that year. dBASE IV was eventually released in October 1988 as two products: Standard and Developer&#x27;s editions.

Unfortunately, dBASE IV was both slow and very buggy. Bugs are not at all that surprising in a major product update, something that would normally be fixed with a &quot;dot-one&quot; release before too much damage was done. This situation had occurred with dBASE III for instance, and Ashton-Tate had quickly fixed the problems. However a number of issues conspired to make the dBASE IV 1.0 release a disaster.

* For one, while dBASE IV did include a compiler, it was not what the developer community was expecting. That community was looking for a product that would generate stand-alone, executable code, similar to Clipper. The dBASE IV compiler did produce object code, but still required the full dBASE IV product to run the result. Many believed that Ashton-Tate intended dBASE IV to compete with and eliminate the third-party developers. The announcement alone did much to upset the livelihood of the various compiler authors.
* More problematic however was the instability of the program. The full scale of the problem only became obvious as more people attempted to use the product, especially those who upgraded to the new version. The bugs were so numerous that most users gave up, resigned to wait for a dot-one release. As word got out, sales slumped as existing users chose to hold off on their upgrades, and new users chose to ignore the product.

Neither of these issues would, by themselves, kill the product. dBASE had an extremely large following and excellent name recognition. All that was needed was an update that addressed the problems. At the time of its release, there was a general consensus within Ashton-Tate that a bug-fix version would be released within six months of the 1.0 release. If that had happened, the loyal users might have been more accepting of the product.

Rather than do that, Ashton-Tate management instead turned their attention to the next generation of applications, code named &quot;Diamond&quot;. Diamond was to be a new, integrated product line capable of sharing large sets of data across applications. This effort had been underway for years and was already consuming many of the resources in the company&#x27;s Glendale, Torrance, Walnut Creek and Los Gatos (Northern California Product Center) offices. However, once it became apparent that Diamond was years away from becoming a product, and with poor reviews and slipping sales of dBASE IV 1.0, Ashton-Tate returned its focus to fixing dBASE IV.

It was almost two years before dBASE IV 1.1 finally shipped (in July 1990). During this time many customers took the opportunity to try out the legions of dBASE clones that had appeared recently, notably FoxBase and Clipper.

Sales of dBASE had plummeted. The company had about 63% of the overall database market in 1988, and only 43% in 1989. In the final four quarters as a company, Ashton-Tate lost close to $40 million. In August 1989, the company laid off over 400 of its 1,800 employees. The Microsoft partnership for a version called the Ashton-Tate/Microsoft SQL Server also came to nothing, as Ashton-Tate&#x27;s sales channels were not prepared to sell what was then a high-end database. The first version of SQL Server also only ran on IBM OS/2, which also limited its success. A version of dBASE that communicated directly with SQL Server, called dBASE IV Server Edition, was released in 1990, and was reviewed as the best available client for SQL Server (in both Databased Advisor and DBMS magazines), but the product never gained traction and was one of the casualties of the Borland acquisition. Microsoft eventually released Access in this role instead.

=== Sale to Borland (1991) ===
Esber had been trying to grow the company for years via acquisitions or combining forces with other software companies, including merger discussions with Lotus in 1985 and again in 1989. Ashton-Tate&#x27;s strategically inept board passed up numerous opportunities for industry-changing mergers. Other merger discussions that Ashton-Tate&#x27;s board rejected or reached an impasse on included Cullinet, Computer Associates, Informix, Symantec and Microsoft. (Microsoft would later acquire Fox Software after Borland acquired Ashton-Tate and the United States Department of Justice forced Borland to not assert ownership of the dBASE language.)

In 1990 Esber proposed a merger with Borland. During the first discussions, the board backed out and dismissed Esber thinking him crazy to entertain a merger of equals (combining the companies at existing market valuations) with the smaller competitor Borland, and on February 11, 1991, replaced him as CEO with William P. &quot;Bill&quot; Lyons. Lyons had been hired to run the non-dBASE business and heretofore had been unsuccessful. Lyons would ship dBASE IV 1.1, a product Esber managed and was already in beta when let go.

After giving the board a merger compensation package (including individual bonuses of $250 thousand) and giving the management team repriced options and golden parachutes, the board and Lyons reinitiated discussions with Borland, but this time structured as a take-over of Ashton-Tate with a significant premium over Ashton-Tate&#x27;s current market valuation but substantially below the price Esber had negotiated.

Wall Street liked the deal and Borland stock would reach new highs shortly before and after the merger. Some considered the $439 million in stock they paid to be too much. Philippe Kahn, CEO of Borland, apparently did not consult with his management team prior to committing to acquire Ashton Tate over a weekend visit to Los Angeles.

The Borland merger was not a smooth one. Borland had been marketing the Paradox database specifically to compete with dBASE, and its programmers considered their system to be far superior to dBASE. The Paradox group was extremely upset whenever Kahn so much as mentioned dBASE, and an intense broke out within the company. Borland was also developing a competitor product called The Borland dBase Compiler for Windows. This product was designed by Gregor Freund who led a small team developing this fast, object-oriented version of dBASE. It was when Borland showed the product to the Ashton-Tate team that they finally conceded that they had lost the battle for dBASE.

Nevertheless, Kahn was observant of the trends in the computer market, and decided that both products should be moved forward to become truly Microsoft Windows-based. The OO-dBASE compiler was no more able to run under Windows than was dBASE IV, causing Borland to abandon both code bases in 1993 and spin up a new team to create a new product, eventually delivered as dBASE for Windows in 1994. Meanwhile, Paradox was deliberately downplayed in the developer market since dBASE was now the largest Borland product. Microsoft introduced Access in late 1992, and eventually took over almost all of the Windows database market. Further, in the summer of 1992 Microsoft acquired Ohio-based Fox Software, makers of the dBASE-like products FoxBASE+ and FoxPro. With Microsoft behind FoxPro, many dBASE and Clipper software developers would start working in FoxPro instead. By the time dBASE for Windows was released, the market hardly noticed. Microsoft appears to have neglected FoxPro subsequent to the acquisition, perhaps because they also owned and promoted Microsoft Access, a direct competitor to dBASE. Certainly, the PC database market became a great deal less competitive as a result of their deal to buy FoxPro.

When Borland eventually sold its Quattro Pro and Paradox products to Novell, where they would be joined with WordPerfect in an attempt to match Microsoft Office, Borland was left with InterBase, which Esber had purchased in the late 1980s and had its origins as a derivative of the RDB database work at DEC. Borland&#x27;s ongoing strategy was to refocus its development tools on the corporate market with client–server applications, so Interbase fitted in as a low-end tool and a good generic SQL database for prototyping. This proved to be the longest lasting and most positive part of the Ashton-Tate acquisition, ironic since it was almost an oversight and little known to Borland until they acquired Ashton-Tate.

Overall, the Ashton-Tate purchase proved to be unsuccessful. Several years later, Philippe Kahn would leave Borland amidst declining financial performance, including many years of losses.

== Downfall ==
While Ashton-Tate&#x27;s downfall can be attributed to several factors, chief among them were:

* the over-reliance on a single-product line (dBASE)
* the appalling quality of dBASE IV on release, compounded by the complete failure to take any action to rectify this when it was needed
* a focus on future products without addressing the needs of the current customers
* the departure of Wayne Ratliff

Any one of these would have been a surmountable problem, but combined they brought about the swift decline of the company.

Ashton-Tate&#x27;s dependence on dBASE is understandable. It was one of the earliest killer applications in the CP/M world, along with WordStar and (on other platforms) VisiCalc, and was able to make the transition to the IBM PC to maintain its dominance. Its success alone is what created and sustained the company through the first nine years. However, the overreliance on dBASE for revenue had a catastrophic effect on the company when dBASE IV sales tanked.

In the end, the poor quality and extremely late release of dBASE IV drove existing customers away and kept new ones from accepting it. This loss of revenue for the cash cow was too much for the company to bear, and combined with management missteps, eventually led to the sale to the upstart Borland International.

== Non-dBASE products ==
Through the mid-1980s Esber increasingly looked to diversify the company&#x27;s holdings, and purchased a number of products to roll into the Ashton-Tate lineup. By and large most of these acquisitions failed and did not result in the revenue expected. This experience is another illustration of the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and products in a rapidly changing technological market.

=== Friday! ===
Friday! was a product conceived during the David Cole era at Ashton-Tate. Named after Robinson Crusoe&#x27;s man Friday, because, by using the program, one could supposedly &quot;get everything done by Friday!&quot;, this was a simple personal information manager (PIM) program written around 1983, years before that acronym became popular. It used a customized version of dBASE II, predating the dBASE III product. Several design flaws surfaced in beta-testing that required a major redesign and rewriting of code. These changes were made in-house by Jim Lewis soon after he joined Ashton-Tate as a lead developer and product manager. After a significant advertising campaign and modest interest, Friday! was eventually withdrawn from the market. (See also, Microsoft Bob.)

=== Javelin ===
On April 10, 1986, Ashton-Tate signed a marketing deal with Javelin Software to distribute their financial modeling software named Javelin outside of the US and Canada.

=== Framework ===
Their most successful attempt at a breakout was with Framework. Framework, like dBASE before it, was the brainchild of a single author, Robert Carr, who felt that integrated applications offered huge benefits over a selection of separate apps doing the same thing. In 1983 he had a runnable demo of his product, and showed it to Ashton-Tate who immediately signed a deal to support development in exchange for marketing rights.

Framework was an integrated DOS-based document-based office suite with an interactive computer language named FRED that combined in an outliner a word processor, spreadsheet, mini-database application, charting tool, and a terminal program. Later versions also added e-mail support and a FRED Developer&#x27;s toolKit with a FRED RunTime version that allowed developers to distribute free versions of Framework that run FRED applications. Framework also had the distinction of being available in over 14 languages, and it was more successful in Europe than in North America. Although DOS based, Framework supported a fully functional GUI based on character graphics (similar to Borland&#x27;s OWL).

Framework eventually got locked into an industry battle, primarily with Lotus Symphony, and later with Microsoft Works. The market was never large to begin with, as most customers chose to purchase the large, monolithic versions of applications even if they never used the extra functionality. Borland later sold Framework and it is being supported today at Framework.com.

=== MultiMate ===
MultiMate was a word processor package created to copy the basic operation of a Wang dedicated word processor workstation on the PC. In the early 1980s many companies used MultiMate to replace these expensive single-purpose systems with PCs, MultiMate offering them an easy migration path. Although it wasn&#x27;t clear at the time, this migration was largely complete by the time Ashton-Tate bought the company in December 1985 from Multimate International for about $20 million[ 9] in a transaction that an Ashton-Tate press release called &quot;the largest ever in the microcomputer software industry&quot;. Sales had plateaued, although they were still fairly impressive at the time. What was originally a deliberate attempt to copy the Wang system now made the product seem hopelessly outdated, and it would require a major upgrade to remain useful. WordPerfect took advantage of these issues and took market share to a degree essentially lethal for MultiMate.

=== The Master series of products ===
Ashton-Tate purchased Decision Resources of Westport, Connecticut, in 1986. Decision Resources had created the Chart Master, Sign Master, Map Master and Diagram Master programs. These were simple, effective business charting/drawing programs that counted on various spreadsheet programs being so poor at charting that people would gladly pay for another program to improve on them. By the time Ashton-Tate purchased the company it was clear that newer generations of spreadsheet programs would improve their charting abilities to the point where the Decision Resource products wouldn&#x27;t be needed, but the company was also working on a new drawing package that was more interesting in the long run.

After the purchase was completed it became clear that the drawing product was inadequate. Although it was released as Draw Applause it never sold well.

=== Byline ===
Byline was an early desktop publishing program developed by the company SkiSoft and distributed and marketed by Ashton-Tate. When it was introduced sometime around 1987, it was both fairly inexpensive and easy to use, and gained a small but devoted following. Users designed a page by filling out an onscreen form that described page characteristics: margins, columns, font and size, and so on. The program created the page and an onscreen preview. This method of working was in contrast to the more directly interactive WYSIWYG approach taken by Aldus PageMaker and Ventura Publisher, which became more popular as windowing systems and GUIs became more common. Also, as time went on more and more so-called desktop publishing features were added to popular word processing software, probably reducing the market for such a low-end desktop publishing program. Oddly, Byline was written in the Forth programming language.

=== RapidFile ===
A flat-file database program launched in October 1986 that was commonly used to create mailing labels and form letters on PCs running the DOS operating system. RapidFile was also adept at organizing and manipulating data imported from other software programs. It was designed to be a fast, easy-to-use and less-expensive database for those who did not require the sophisticated capabilities of dBASE. It achieved moderate success for Ashton-Tate, but a version for Microsoft Windows was never developed. RapidFile is unusual in that it was developed in the programming language Forth.

Rapidfile version 1.2 was released in 1986, with versions available in several languages including English, French and Dutch. Although Rapidfile was created for the DOS operating system, information is available RapidFile database software, by Ashton Tate to show that it can be persuaded to work reasonably well in the DOS box of Microsoft Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP, and also under Linux using the DOSemu DOSEMU Main Page emulation software.

=== Apple Macintosh products ===
When Apple Computer was introducing the Macintosh (&quot;Mac&quot;) in the early 1980s, Ashton-Tate was one of the &quot;big three&quot; software companies that Apple desperately wanted to support their new platform. When approached, Ashton-Tate indicated an interest in becoming a major player in the new market.

As early as the winter of 1984, only a few months after the Macintosh introduction, the company hired a small Macintosh database development team and moved them to their Glendale development center to work on what would later be known as dBASE Mac. Soon after this, in early 1985, they agreed to fund development of a spreadsheet program being developed by Randy Wigginton, former project lead of MacWrite. Years later they added a &quot;high-end&quot; word processor from Ann Arbor Softworks, who were in the midst of a rather public debacle while trying to release FullWrite Professional, which was now almost a year late.

Ed Esber and Apple Computer chairman John Sculley jointly announced Ashton Tate&#x27;s family of Mac products in Palo Alto, California. dBASE Mac finally shipped in September 1987, but it was dBASE in name only. Users were dismayed to learn that in order to interact with their major investment in dBASE on the PC, their applications would have to be re-written from scratch. Adding to their frustration was the fact that it crashed frequently and was extremely slow. Given that the program was really a completely new Mac-only system, it had to compete with other Mac-only database systems like 4th Dimension, Helix and FileMaker.

FullWrite and Full Impact were released in 1988. Both were liked by reviewers and had leading edge features. FullWrite was an outstanding product, while Full Impact had the bad luck of being timed just after a major new release of Microsoft Excel and the release of Informix Wingz.

All three products were excellent at their core, but were not viewed as a family and needed to link together more cleanly. They all also needed a solid follow-up release to address some of the bugs and performance issues. However, no major upgrades were ever shipped for either FullWrite or dBASE Mac, and the only major upgrade to FullImpact shipped a full two years after release. Releases of Microsoft Word and Excel soon closed some of the feature gaps, and as the Mac OS changed the products became increasingly difficult to run. Microsoft embarked on a campaign in earnest to discredit and kill Ashton-Tate&#x27;s products, at one time exaggerating the system requirements for FullWrite, and going so far as to delete Ashton Tate software from Mac dealers&#x27; demonstration computers.

FullWrite was later sold off by Borland in 1994 to Akimbo Systems, but by that time Microsoft Word had achieved market domination and they, too, eventually gave up on it. dBASE Mac was sold off in 1990 and re-released as nuBASE, but it was no more successful and was gone within a year. Full Impact simply disappeared.

=== SQL Server ===
One problem with dBASE and similar products is that it was not based on the client–server model. That means that when a database is used by a number of users on a network, the system normally relies on the underlying network software to deliver entire files to the user&#x27;s desktop machine where the actual query work is carried out. This creates heavy load on the network, as each user &quot;pulls down&quot; the database files, often to do the same query over and over. In contrast, a client–server system receives only small &quot;commands&quot; from the user&#x27;s machine, processes the command locally on the server, and then returns only those results the user was looking for. Overall network use is dramatically lowered.

A client–server database is a fundamentally different sort of system than a traditional single-user system like dBASE, and although they share many features in common, it is typically not a simple task to take an existing single-user product and turn it into a true client–server system. As the business world became increasingly networked, Ashton-Tate&#x27;s system would become irrelevant without updating to the client server era.

Ed Esber and Bill Gates introduced SQL Server to the world in a joint New York press conference. The basic idea was to use SQL Server as a back-end and dBASE as the front-end, allowing the existing dBASE market to use their forms and programming knowledge on top of a SQL system. SQL Server was actually a product developed by Sybase corporation, which Microsoft had licensed. From a business perspective this had little direct effect on the company, at least in the short term.

dBASE continued to sell well, and the company eventually peaked at $318M in yearly sales. During this period, Esber hired some of the most brilliant database engineers in the industry, including Dr. Moshe Zloof from IBM, Harry Wong, and Mike Benson (who would later head Esber&#x27;s efforts to rebuild a new dBASE).

=== Tate Publishing ===
The Tate Publishing division of Ashton-Tate initially published books about Ashton-Tate&#x27;s software; in October 1988 it branched out to third-party software.

== Lawsuits ==
Esber had earlier threatened a group of dBASE users who were attempting to define a standard dBASE file format. With this standard, anyone could create a dBASE compatible system, something Esber simply wouldn&#x27;t allow. But as soon as they were issued the cease-and-desist, they simply changed their effort to create a &quot;new&quot; standard known as &quot;xBase&quot;.

Esber had previously decided to sue one of the clone companies involved, then known as Fox Software. By the time the case worked its way to court in 1990, Fox Software had released FoxPro and was busy increasing market share. If the court case was successful, Ashton-Tate could stop FoxPro and use the precedent to stop the other clones as well, allowing dBASE to regain a footing and recover from the dBASE IV incident.

These hopes came to an end when the case was thrown out of court. During the initial proceedings it was learned that dBASE&#x27;s file format and language had been based on a mainframe product used at JPL, where Ratliff had been working when he first created Vulcan. The credibility of Ratliff was jeopardized by his alternate claims of ownership while at Ashton Tate and then supporting the roots at JPL after he left. All the facts were never sorted out and Ashton-Tate&#x27;s competitors had a self-interest motivated field day in writing amicus briefs.

When the federal judge reviewed the work of his clerks he overturned his earlier ruling, and decided to hear the case on whether or not Ashton-Tate owned the language. In April 1991, the judge vindicated Esber&#x27;s decision to protect Ashton-Tate&#x27;s investment of several hundred million in the development and marketing of dBase, by ruling that Ashton-Tate did own the language. Unfortunately, his earlier ruling had already done considerable damage. Eventually, as part of the merger with Borland, the US Justice Department required that Borland not assert copyright claims to menu commands and the command language of dBASE. This paved the way for Microsoft to buy Fox Software.

<doc id="326109" wikidata="Q16000075" url="?curid=326109" title="DC connector">
<text>A DC connector (or DC plug, for one common type) is an electrical connector that supplies direct current (DC) power.

Compared to domestic AC power plugs and sockets, DC connectors have many more standard types that are not interchangeable. The dimensions and arrangement of DC connectors can be chosen to prevent accidental interconnection of incompatible sources and loads. Types vary from small coaxial connectors used to power portable electronic devices from AC adapters to connectors used for automotive accessories and for battery packs in portable equipment.

== Extra-low voltage (under 120 VDC) ==
These extra-low voltage connectors are rated at or below 120 VDC.

=== Cylindrical connectors ===

Small cylindrical connectors come in various sizes. They may be known as &quot;coaxial power connectors,&quot; &quot;barrel connectors,&quot; &quot;concentric barrel connectors,&quot; or &quot;tip connectors.&quot;

These plugs are intended for use on the cable connected to an external AC adapter (power supply). The matching jack or socket is permanently fitted to power the equipment. Some of these jacks contain a normally closed contact, which can be used to disconnect internal batteries whenever the power supply is connected, avoiding the risk of battery leakage or explosion posed by incorrect battery recharging.

Cylindrical plugs usually have an insulated tip constructed to accept the insertion of a pin. The outer body of the plug is one contact, most often but not always the negative side of the supply. Inverted polarity plugs can and do damage circuitry when plugged in, even if the voltage is correct; not all equipment is equipped with protection. A pin mounted in the socket makes contact with a second internal contact. The outer plug contact is often called the &quot;barrel&quot;, &quot;sleeve&quot;, or &quot;ring&quot;, while the inner is called the &quot;tip&quot;.

There are a wide variety of sizes and designs for these power connectors, and many appear pretty similar to each other yet are not quite mechanically or electrically compatible. In addition to many generic designs (whose original designer is unknown), there are at least two national standards—EIAJ in Japan and DIN in Germany, plus the JSBP connector used on some laptop computers. The Japanese EIAJ standard includes five sizes, each supporting a specified range of voltages. However, most other coaxial DC power connectors have no specified voltage association. Generic plugs are often named for the pin diameter they are designed to take.

Many non-proprietary co-axial power plugs are in outside diameter (OD) and in length. Two pin sizes are standard in the jacks for this size plug body, and , and the plugs should match. If the size is not known, it is difficult to distinguish by eye or measurement between the 2.1mm and 2.5mm ID plugs; some suppliers suggest simple methods.

Maximum current ratings commonly vary from unspecified up to 5 A (11 A for unique high-power versions from some companies), with 1 A, 2 A, and 5 A being common values. The smaller types usually have lower ratings, both for current and voltage. The &#x27;tip&#x27; (i.e., the inner conductor) usually carries the positive (+) pole, but some devices and their power supplies use the negative tip. The connector size does not usually indicate the voltage. It is not possible, except for some proprietary connectors, to reliably infer any information on power parameters (current, voltage, polarity, even whether AC or DC) by examining the connector.

=== Snap and lock DC power connectors ===

Snap and lock DC power connectors look similar to Mini-DIN connectors but have either 3 or 4 thicker pins and a slightly larger mating shell. Because of this, they do not mate with any of the standardized Mini-DIN connectors. Some devices, however, use a proper 4-pin Mini-DIN connector for power instead, presenting the possibility of mating such a connector with the wrong port (such as an S-Video output).
* Known as Kycon 3-pin and 4-pin DC power plugs.
* Erroneously also known as &quot;Power DIN&quot;, although different from any standardized Mini-DIN or DIN connector type.
* The male plug&#x27;s mating shell outer diameter is , and the pins are diameter
* Standard may include a limit of 20 V at 7.5 amperes
* Sometimes, there&#x27;s a knurled retaining ring surrounding the male plug which allows fastening the plug to the chassis receiving the power.
* Some connectors have a right-angle connector, as seen in the picture.
* For aesthetics, some Dell laptop chargers have a glowing ring at the connector tip.

=== Molex connector ===

Molex connectors were frequently used as DC power connectors in personal computers, for floppy, hard disk, and CD drives. These connectors have four pins, +5 V (red), 2 common ground (black), and +12 V (yellow). SATA peripherals use a different style of connector.

Locking Molex connectors are available in 3, 4, and 6 terminal configurations.
=== XT connectors ===
Solder cup terminals are primarily designed for the in-line solder termination of conductors. This style of terminal is principally designed as a precision-machined pin for insertion into connector bodies.

=== IEC 60906-3:1994 ===
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has produced a standard for a system of 2-pin plugs and socket-outlets for household and similar purposes in fixed and portable applications, either indoors or outdoors. Safety extra-low voltage (SELV) plugs and socket-outlets carry up to 16 amperes, and have eight keying possibilities, to indicate 6, 12, 24, or 48 volts, AC or DC.

The connector is circular, with the male connector having two pins placed symmetrically inside a circular shield, and the female connector having two receptacles surrounded by a circular groove to accept the male shield, in turn surrounded by a second circular shield which projects past the mating surface and encloses the male connector. (It somewhat resembles a smaller IEC 60309 connector.)

The dimensions are as follows:
The male shield has two keys projecting inwards, which fit into notches in the female body. The larger key is at right angles to the pins, wide and ending at a radius of from the connector centre. The corresponding notch is wide and ends at a radius of from the connector centre.

The angle of the second key from the first indicates the voltage and current type. The eight permitted angles are multiples of 30° which are not multiples of 90°. Angles of ±30° and ±60° indicate alternating current (50 or 60 Hz), while angles of ±120° or ±150° indicate direct current with the pin at 90° being negative and the pin at 270° being positive.

The second key is smaller than the first, wide ending at a radius of from the connector centre. The corresponding notch in the female connector body is wide and ends at a radius of from the connector centre.

With the angles measured clockwise looking at the female connector (counter-clockwise looking at the male), the various key positions indicate:
The so-called &quot;Mini IEC connectors&quot; are unrelated and not even standardized by the IEC at all; they are called that because they resemble a smaller IEC C13 connector.
=== IEC 61076 (ELV) ===


The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has standardized a set of multi-pin screw plugs matching ISO metric screw thread, available in M5, M8 and M12 sizes. M5 connectors are very low current, typically only used for signal wiring, while some M8 pin arrangements are rated for up to 3 A, and some M12 arrangements are available up to 16 A. The multi-pin design caters for Ethernet, single and three-phase AC, as well as single or multiple voltage DC. The DC ratings are typically 60 V and below, however the F-coding is rated for 300 V (see #IEC 61076 (LV) below).
=== Tamiya connectors ===
Tamiya connectors are commonly used on radio control (toy) vehicle battery packs and chargers.
=== JST RCY connector ===

The JST RCY-series connector is a 2.5mm-pitch and manufactured by J.S.T. Mfg. Co., Ltd. It is known in radio control circles as the battery eliminator circuit (BEC) or P connector. JST also produces other types of connectors that are used in R/C and hobby electronics.
=== Deans style T-Plug ===

The Deans style T-Plug connector is a polarized high power plug that inhibits accidental reversed connections. This also applies in particular to avoid the LiPo flash, which can cause burn injuries or related damage. Depending on the make, Deans plugs are sensitive to overheating during soldering, as the plastic can become soft and the plug surfaces can easily twist. Depending on the construction, they can support currents up to 40A (pulse to 70A).

Usual pin assignment T-Plug: negative (-) is the parallel pin; positive (+) is the perpendicular pin.

=== Inverter tabs/lugs ===
Inverter tabs/lugs are available in 2, 4, and 8 AWG. These are designed to pass very high currents at voltages up to 600 V DC to and from battery packs, inverters, and other high-current loads to a terminal bus.
=== Airline in-seat power supply system ===

Two different airline in-seat power supply system (ISPSS) standards for DC power have been used in the past. American Airlines in the past used an automobile auxiliary power outlet. Most other airlines that provide DC power use the smaller EmPower system, which has a 4-pin Hypertronics&#x27; D-series connector. It can supply 15 volts maximum 5 amperes.
=== Anderson Powerpole connectors ===

Powerpole connectors are a series developed by Anderson Power Products[10] and available in a variety of sizes and colors. The commonly used 15/30/45 series connectors are interoperable and use the same housings but different contacts for different wire sizes and current requirements.

Powerpole connectors are physically and electrically genderless, thus avoiding the need to worry about which end is the plug and which the socket, or which end has the correct polarity, as is the case with the physically but not electrically genderless two-wire trailer plug.

Powerpoles have been adopted as a standard 12 VDC connector by most RACES Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service organizations and ARES Amateur Radio Emergency Service units. They deliver good current capability for their sizes and facilitate very easy pluggability for those without good eyesight or good lighting. However, they can be damaged relatively quickly and, if not correctly crimped, can occasionally separate from each other easily with minimal force unless additional retaining measures are taken.

=== SAE connector ===
The SAE connector is a physically self-mating hermaphrodite two-conductor DC connector commonly used for solar and automotive applications (including motorcycles). It is so named for the Society of Automotive Engineers which created the specifications this connector is based on.

Although the plug is physically hermaphroditic, and any SAE connector can be connected to any other SAE connector, they are NOT electrically hermaphroditic, and care needs to be taken to maintain correct polarity when connecting different plugs.

This connector typically applies a maintenance charge to a vehicle battery. When installed in a vehicle and attached to a battery, the polarity of the connector is always such that no short circuit will occur if the exposed terminal touches the vehicle chassis. In most vehicles, this means that the exposed terminal connects to the battery&#x27;s negative terminal. Conversely, the positive terminal on a battery charger is exposed to mate with the concealed one on the vehicle side. (This is reversed on vehicles with a positive-ground frame, such as vintage British motorcycles.)

Although there is a risk of short-circuiting a battery charger, the risk is minimal and often mitigated by the circuitry of the battery charger itself. On the other hand, the short-circuit current of the lead–acid batteries installed in vehicles is sufficiently great that a short circuit could result in a fire or explosion. The priority is therefore given to avoiding short circuits of the vehicle battery rather than the charger.

Although the term &quot;SAE connector&quot; is commonly used to refer to the pictured two-pin connector, many different connector standards are designated by SAE International which may also be referred to by this term. Furthermore, while the design of the subject connector was inspired by and based on SAE Standards, the connector itself has no official SAE designation.

The SAE Specifications are available for J928 and J1239 but do require payment to be viewed.

=== Car lighter sockets and plugs ===

The automobile auxiliary power outlet is also called a cigarette lighter receptacle, or cigar lighter receptacle, since it was originally designed as a lighter for cigars—hence its rather large size. Nowadays, it is used to power automotive accessories such as portable inverters, mobile phone chargers and portable refrigerators.

These sockets were not originally designed to provide DC power, and are not an ideal DC connector for several reasons, but still widely used for compatibility to existing accessories. Three sizes exist, one for 6 VDC and two for 12 VDC and the mating of the different sized 12 VDC plugs and jacks is problematic. Because of this, and the small gauge wire sometimes used, they may provide unreliable power connections.

The polarity for 12 VDC sockets is center pin positive (+), outer collar negative (−). Reversed polarity will damage some electronic devices.

Although the nominal voltage of a 12 V lead acid battery is 12 VDC, when the engine is running the car&#x27;s battery charging system will bring the system voltage to 13.8 VDC or higher. The possible range of battery voltages from 11–15 VDC must be taken into account by devices attached to the cigar lighter socket.

This connector is also often used for powering accessories on motorcycles, such as heated clothing (vests, gloves, etc.) or GPS units. This makes &quot;plugging in&quot; easier to manage while wearing gloves. As the accessory lacks any power of its own, there&#x27;s no risk of &quot;shorting&quot; the exposed connector.

=== ISO 4165 connector ===

Similar in concept to an automotive cigar lighter, the ISO 4165 connector is shorter and smaller.

Found most frequently on motorcycles, it is also known as a &quot;BMW Accessory&quot;, &quot;Hella&quot;, &quot;Merit&quot;, &quot;Norm&quot; or &quot;Powerlet&quot; connector.

=== XLR connectors used for power ===

In the broadcast, film, and television industries, the 4-pin XLR connector is the standard for 12 V power. The connectors are wired pin 1 negative, pin 4 positive. Often pins 1 and 2 will be negative, 3 and 4 positive for a higher current rating. Female connectors are used as supply and male connectors are used on loads. Most battery belts and power supplies output 13.2 V, but equipment can usually handle a range of 11–18 volts to accommodate battery packs of varying voltages and charging while operating.

The readily available XLR3 is also used by some manufacturers as power supply plugs despite their being a well-accepted standard for other purposes.
=== Clipsal connectors ===

In Australia, a T-configuration Clipsal socket is used for extra-low voltage DC power outlets, such as in stand-alone power systems (SAPS) or on boats, in order to prevent accidental connections of 12 V appliances into socket-outlets. This connector is also used for temporary equipment in emergency vehicles.

The connector pins are mutually perpendicular, and are usually oriented to look like a capital T. Polarity at the outlet can be random, and must be verified to avoid equipment damage.
=== USB socket ===

Due to the popularity of USB for mobile phones and tablets, USB sockets and plugs have become a common choice for other small devices that require five volts or less, even those that require no data connection. Examples include flashlights, toys such as small helicopters, and rechargeable battery packs (which in turn provide five volts over USB to recharge other devices). Wall sockets with built-in USB power adapters and USB sockets are available.

In 2009, the EU created a common external power supply specification, a voluntary specification which encouraged mobile phone manufacturers to use the micro USB-B connector. As of 2016, most new mobile phones used this connector for charging.

In 2012, the USB Power Delivery (PD) specification was released. The USB PD specification provides the ability for 5 V devices to draw more than (the USB battery-charging specification limit of) 7.5 W of power from USB &quot;PD-aware&quot; ports when using PD-aware USB cables. The specification also allows USB PD ports to provide even greater power at higher voltages over PD-aware cables – up to 36 W at 12 V and 60 W at 20 V (for micro-USB connectors) and up to 60 W at 12 V and 100 W at 20 V (for standard USB A/B connectors).
After previous connectors were deprecated in USB 3.2, the new USB-C plug has become a new standard for charging (and data transfer) over USB.

In the European Union, the Radio Equipment Directive 2021/0291, requires new smartphones to use USB-C as a universal charger by the end of 2024, and laptops by 2026.

=== Other DC connectors ===

* There are a number of similar design PC board power connectors, including Molex Mini-Fit SR, Molex Mini-fit jr., MOLEX MICROFIT and Molex SABRE connectors, and AMP DUAC connectors that look similar to each other.
* Some plugs with three, four, five or more pins are also called &quot;DC plugs&quot;. These were common on vacuum tube equipment and continue to be used where several voltages are supplied. On vacuum tube equipment the pins are normally on the equipment side of the join for safety reasons.
* Many mobile phones use DC connectors that are unique to the manufacturer, or even a specific phone. In the interest of improved interoperability of phone battery chargers, major manufacturers have agreed to standardize on the micro-USB connector for new phone chargers from 2010.
* Many manufacturers make special-purpose DC power connectors for battery packs, instruments, medical equipment, communications equipment and other devices.
* Power Pack (PP) series of batteries such as the PP3 nine-volt battery have circular and hexagonal terminals which mate with a &quot;snap&quot; connector with physically identical (but opposite-polarity) terminals.
* Special &quot;octal&quot; connectors with either 8 or 11 pins, almost identical to octal relay sockets or tube sockets, were used to connect power supplies to some tube audio amplifiers, transmitters, and transceivers (especially in amateur radio models). Female sockets were installed on the power supply and male sockets (with exposed pins) on the radio equipment. Cable assemblies with mating connectors were also readily available. These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (−130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for heaters (filaments), and control functions (remote mains switching).
== Low voltage (120–1,500 VDC) ==
These low voltage connectors are rated at or below 1,500 VDC.

=== Anderson SBS ===
The Anderson SBS and SBS Mini series of connectors are rated at up to 600 VDC at (depending on the connector) 50 A, 75 A or 110 A. They are only rated for disconnection under load at up to 120 VDC however.

These connectors see use as battery bank connectors in higher power UPS systems, where the battery bank voltages are between 48 VDC and 500 VDC.

=== MC4 connector ===

MC4 connectors are common on photovoltaic panels. Because these panels are exposed to the weather for decades, MC4 includes a rubber sealing ring to keep out moisture. Because solar panels are often stacked in strings of hundreds of volts, MC4 has locking clips to hold the wires together. Because solar panels can be connected in series strings, or parallel arrays, the positive and negative terminals use separate connectors.
=== IEC 61076 (LV) ===


The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has standardized a set of multi-pin screw plugs matching ISO metric screw thread, available in M5, M8 and M12 sizes (see #IEC 61076 (ELV) above). The M12 F-coding is rated for 300 V.
=== IEC TS 62735 ===


The &quot;IEC TS 62735&quot; standard specifies connectors capable of carrying between 294 and 400 VDC. There are two connectors in the standard rated at 2.6 kW and 5.2 kW. The lower current plug can be inserted into the higher current socket, but the higher current plug will not mate with the lower current socket. The 2.6 kW plug can be disconnected under load, but the 5.2 kW plug cannot.

Designed primarily for supplying power to computer and communications equipment, these connectors are intended to allow data centers to migrate towards supplying equipment with DC power as an alternative to AC.

=== Saf-D-Grid ===
The Saf-D-Grid connector delivers up to 600 VDC at up to 30 A, with the connector occupying the same space as an IEC 320 C13/C14 connector normally limited to 250 VAC at 10 A. The connector can also be disconnected under load.

Like the IEC 62735, this connector was designed to replace the IEC connector used in computer power supplies so that they can be operated from 380–400 VDC instead. Introduced in January 2009, it arrived before the competing IEC standard, however despite this it has not seen widespread use.

=== Molex Imperium ===
The Imperium connector from Molex is aimed at automotive applications and is rated at 1,000 VDC at 250 A. As of 2021 the manufacturer has classed this connector as obsolete.

=== Vehicle charging connectors ===
In order to avoid heavy transformers onboard vehicles, high power charging of battery electric vehicles has the transformers in the ground station, and supply to the vehicle is done with DC at around 400 volts.

There are some competing standards:
* Combined Charging System (CCS) in Europe and Americas
* GB/T in China
* CHAdeMO in Japan and for Japanese vehicles
== High voltage (over 1,500 VDC) ==
These high voltage connectors are rated for voltages above 1,500 VDC.

=== Banana connector ===

The Banana connector, normally only rated for extra-low voltage, is available in a high voltage variant as well. This version of the connector contains a thick shroud around both male and female connectors, permitting use at voltages of up to 30 kV. The shroud is typically deep enough to prevent connection by traditional banana plugs. This style of connector is often seen on high voltage test equipment, such as power supplies and volt meters capable of handling 10 kV and above.

<text>Karl Hjalmar Branting (; 23 November 1860 – 24 February 1925) was a Swedish politician who was the leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) from 1907 until his death in 1925, and three times Prime Minister of Sweden. When Branting came to power in 1920, he was the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden. When taking office for a second term after the general election of 1921, he became the first social democratic head of government in Western Europe elected under universal suffrage. An early supporter of modern social democracy and democratic socialism, he led the SAP through a transformation from a radical socialist movement to Sweden&#x27;s dominant party; the Social Democrats have been Sweden&#x27;s largest party in every election since 1914, and formed government for 44 continuous years from 1932 to 1976. 

In 1921, Branting shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the Norwegian secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Christian Lous Lange.

== Biography ==
Born to the professor Lars Gabriel Branting and the noblewoman and pianist Emma af Georgii, Branting was educated in Stockholm and at Uppsala University. He developed a scientific background in mathematical astronomy and was an assistant at the Stockholm Observatory, but gave up his devotion to scientific work to become a journalist in 1884 and began editing the newspapers &quot;Tiden&quot; and &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot;. The latter was official media outlet of the Swedish Social Democratic Party. His decision to publish an article by the more radical socialist Axel Danielsson, a piece denounced by opponents as insulting to religious sensitivities, resulted in political convictions for blasphemy and imprisonment for both men. Branting was imprisoned for three months in 1888.

Together with August Palm, Branting was one of the main organizers of the Swedish Social Democratic Party in 1889. He was its first Member of Parliament from 1896 and for six years the only one.

In the early years of the 20th century, Branting led the Social Democrats in opposing a war to force Norway to remain in a personal union with Sweden. When the crisis came in 1905, he coined the slogan &quot;Hands off Norway, King!&quot; The Social Democrats organized resistance to a call-up of reserves and made preparations for a general strike against a war; historians now acclaim this as a major factor in Norway&#x27;s peaceful independence. In 1908 Branting established a monthly theoretical political journal entitled &quot;Tiden&quot; which is still in publication.

Branting accepted Eduard Bernstein&#x27;s revision of Marxism and became a reformist socialist, advocating a peaceful transition from capitalism towards socialism. He believed that if workers were given the vote through universal suffrage, socialist legislation could be brought through the Riksdag. Branting supported the February Revolution in Russia in 1917. He supported the moderate Mensheviks against Lenin&#x27;s more extreme Bolsheviks and defended the government of Alexander Kerensky, whom he even personally visited in Petrograd. When the October Revolution broke out in the winter of that year, Branting condemned the Bolshevik seizure of power. 1917 saw a split in the Swedish Social Democratic Party on this question, and the youth league and the revolutionary sections of the party broke away and formed the Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden, initially headed by Zeth Höglund, which soon reorganized as the Swedish Communist Party. Höglund later returned to the Social Democratic Party after Branting&#x27;s death, and wrote a two-volume biography of Branting.

As prime minister, Branting brought Sweden into the League of Nations and was personally active as a delegate within it. When the question of whether Åland should be handed over to Sweden after the independence of Finland from Russia was brought up, he let the League decide upon the issue; the islands became an autonomous region of Finland. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1921 for his work in the League of Nations, sharing the prize with the Norwegian Christian Lous Lange.

Branting died in Stockholm at the age of 64 on 24 February 1925, four months after being sworn in for a third term as prime minister following the SAP&#x27;s victory in the 1924 general election. He was succeeded as prime minister by Rickard Sandler; Per Albin Hansson became party chairman, later serving as prime minister from 1932 to 1946.

== Monuments and memorials ==

Branting is commemorated by the Branting Monument in Stockholm. Additionally in Gothenburg, there is a tram and bus interchange named after Branting (Swedish: Hjalmar Brantingsplatsen). Stockholms Plads (Stockholm Square) in Copenhagen was renamed Hjalmar Brantings Plads in 1925.

<doc id="326111" wikidata="Q379103" url="?curid=326111" title="Adur District">
<text>Adur () is a local government district in West Sussex, England. It is named after the River Adur which flows through the area. The council is based in the town of Shoreham-by-Sea, and the district also contains the town of Southwick, the large village of Lancing and a modest rural hinterland inland. The district had a population of 64,626 at the 2021 census.

Sompting, Lancing, Shoreham and Southwick form a strip of settlements on the south coast, between Worthing and Brighton collectively known as the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation. Shoreham Airport is located in the Adur district, west of Shoreham-by-Sea and just east of Lancing.

The Adur Festival is held in the first two weeks of June every year.

The district lies on the south coast, and parts of its area lie within the South Downs National Park. The neighbouring districts are Worthing, Arun, Horsham and Brighton and Hove.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the whole area of two former districts and parts of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Shoreham-by-Sea Urban District
*Southwick Urban District
*Worthing Rural District (parishes of Coombes, Lancing and Sompting only, rest went to Arun)
The new district was named Adur after the River Adur which flows through the area and reaches the sea at Shoreham.

Since 2008 Adur District Council has worked in partnership with neighbouring Worthing Borough Council, as Adur and Worthing Councils, sharing a joint management structure, with a single chief executive.

==Governance==
Adur District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by West Sussex County Council. Parts of the district are covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2024 election.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2000 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in July 2024, the composition of the council was:
Two of the independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Shoreham Beach Residents&#x27; Association&quot; group. The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2004 the council has comprised 29 councillors representing 14 wards, with each ward electing two councillors except Widewater, which elects three. Elections are held in alternate years for roughly half the council each time to serve a four year term of office.

===Premises===

The council is based at the Shoreham Centre on Pond Road, which was built in the 1970s as a community centre but was substantially extended in 2015 to also serve as the council&#x27;s meeting place and offices. Prior to 2015 the council was based at the Civic Centre on Ham Road, Shoreham, which was subsequently demolished.

==Towns and parishes==
There are three civil parishes in the district, being Coombes, Lancing, and Sompting. Coombes has a parish meeting rather than a parish council due to its low population. The rest of the district, corresponding to the area of the pre-1974 urban districts of Shoreham-by-Sea and Southwick, is an unparished area.

==Sports clubs==
*Lancing F.C.
*Shoreham F.C.
*Southwick F.C.
*Lancing Utd F.C.
==Media==
In terms of television, Adur is served by BBC South East and ITV Meridian broadcasting from the Whitehawk Hill transmitter. 

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Sussex, Heart South, Capital Brighton, More Radio Worthing and Seaside Hospital Radio that broadcast from the Southlands Hospital in Shoreham. 

Local newspapers are the &quot;Shoreham Herald&quot;, &quot;West Sussex Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Argus&quot;. 

==Twin towns==
Adur is twinned with
* Żywiec, Poland
* Riom, France

==Climate==
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

<text>Arun is a local government district in West Sussex, England. Its council is based in Littlehampton. The district&#x27;s other towns are Arundel and Bognor Regis. The district is named after the River Arun, which runs through the centre of the district. Parts of the district fall within the South Downs National Park.

*Littlehampton Urban District
*Worthing Rural District (except parishes of Coombes, Lancing, and Sompting, which went to Adur District)
The new district was named Arun, after the River Arun which flows through the centre of the district, passing through the town of Arundel and meeting the sea at Littlehampton.

==Geography==
Arun District occupies the central southern area of West Sussex, and is bordered by Chichester District to the west, Horsham District to the north and Worthing borough and Adur District to the east. The district is bisected by the River Arun, and is divided between a broad rural area in the north of the district that contains Arundel and a host of small villages, part of which sits within the South Downs National Park, and an urban coastal strip that includes Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

==Governance==

Arun District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by West Sussex County Council. The district is also entirely divided into civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2019. Following the 2023 election the Conservatives were the largest party, but a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Labour, Greens and some of the independents took control of the council, appointing a Liberal Democrat leader and Labour deputy leader of the council, to replace the previous Conservative minority administration.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2002 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in June 2024, the composition of the council was:
Four of the independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Independent Group&quot;, which forms part of the council&#x27;s administration with the Liberal Democrats, Labour and Greens. The other three independents do not form part of a group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===

The council has its headquarters at the Civic Centre on Maltravers Road in Littlehampton, which was purpose-built for the council in 1986. It also maintains an area office at the Town Hall on Clarence Road in Bognor Regis.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 54 councillors elected from 23 wards, with each ward electing either two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Wards===
The wards are:

*Aldwick East
*Aldwick West
*Angmering &amp; Findon
*Arundel &amp; Walberton
*Barnham
*Beach
*Bersted
*Brookfield
*Courtwick with Toddington
*East Preston
*Felpham East
*Felpham West
*Ferring
*Hotham
*Marine
*Middleton-on-Sea
*Orchard
*Pagham
*Pevensey
*River
*Rustington East
*Rustington West
*Yapton
==Civil parishes==
The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Arundel, Bognor Regis and Littlehampton have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The following 31 civil parishes are located within the district:

==Economy==
Although set within the typically prosperous county of West Sussex, much of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton are ranked amongst the 20% most deprived areas in the UK as a whole on the Index of Multiple Deprivation.
The district contains a large tourism sector, attracting visitors to the South Downs in the north, and the beaches of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in the south, the latter of which holds a prestigious Blue Flag Award. Consequently, the district suffers from high amounts of seasonal employment, with the Office for National Statistics estimating that nearly 11% of the population of Arun is employed in the tourism sector, compared to 8% nationally, whilst 28% of people work in the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector, compared to just 23% nationally. Arun also has a higher number of public sector workers than either the regional or national average, and a significantly smaller finance and IT sector than the rest of the South East and wider UK.

==Awards==
In 2008, the district council won an Ashden Award for their work on energy efficiency.

The District Council is regularly awarded the prestigious Green Flag Award which is given for excellent parks. Currently five parks in the District are recognised as meeting the requirements of Green Flag; Mewsbrook Park, Hotham Park, Norfolk Gardens, Old Rectory Gardens and Marine Park Gardens.

<doc id="326113" wikidata="Q489330" url="?curid=326113" title="Framework (office suite)">
<text>Framework, launched in 1984, was an office suite to run on the (x86) IBM PC and compatibles with the MS-DOS operating system.

Unlike other integrated products, Framework was not created as &quot;plug-in&quot; modules with a similar look and feel, but as a single windowing workspace representing a desktop metaphor that could manage and outline &quot;Frames&quot; sharing a common underlying format.

Framework could be considered a predecessor to the present graphical user interface window metaphor: it was the first all-in-one package to run on any PC platform to offer a GUI, WYSIWYG typography on the display and printer output, as well as integrated interpreters.

== History ==
=== Background ===
ValDocs, an even earlier integrated suite, and actually comparable to the original Macintosh of 1984 and Apple Lisa of 1982, was produced by Epson, a complete integrated work station that ran on the previous-generation Zilog Z80 CPU and CP/M operating system, with a graphical user interface (GUI) and &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; typography on the monitor and printing. Despite several iterations, ValDocs was too slow on the hardware that it was released on.

A few months before Framework, its close rival Lotus Symphony was released.

Framework offered all of the above ValDocs&#x27; functionality in the first all-in-one package to run on any PC platform.

&quot;Programmers at Work&quot; credits Robert Carr as the designer and principal developer of Framework.

=== Forefront Corporation ===
Robert Carr and Marty Mazner founded Forefront Corporation to develop Framework in 1983. In July of that year, they approached Ashton-Tate to provide the capital and to later market the product. Together with a team of six other individuals, Carr and company released the original Framework.

The initial release of Framework included about a dozen or so frame types (identified by a FRED function, @frametype). Frame types included containers which could be filled up with other frames, empty frames which could become other type of frames based on user input, formulas embedded in them or program output targeting them, word processor frames, flat-database frames and spreadsheet as well as graphic frames.

The product proved successful enough, that in 1985, Ashton-Tate bought Forefront a year sooner than planned.

=== Ashton-Tate era ===
The original team, now working for Ashton-Tate, continued to enhance the product.

Later Framework versions included a frame type that can hold compiled executable code.
Beginning with Framework II (1985), the company also produced the Framework II Runtime and the Framework II Developer&#x27;s Toolkit. These products allowed application developers to create business applications using the built-in FRED programming language.
Novel MHS Electronic Mail was integrated into Framework and a MailBox cabinet was added to the desktop.

Framework III was produced in 1988–1989, and in 1991, Framework IV emerged as the last Ashton-Tate-released version.

Although Ashton-Tate humorously advertised, that &quot;Lotus uses Framework&quot;, Framework failed to gain more than a fraction of the market share needed to become a workplace standard. Lotus 1-2-3 was able to successfully capture most of the spreadsheet market, and after a number of setbacks regarding Ashton-Tate&#x27;s flagship product dBASE, Borland bought Ashton-Tate, and later sold Framework to Selections &amp; Functions, Inc.

=== Selections and Functions, Inc ===
Beginning with Framework V (Framework 5), Selections and Functions introduced only a few features — mainly features required to prevent the office suite from becoming out-of-date.

For example, Framework VII (Framework 7) introduced long file names, the Euro symbol and the ability to display pictures in Framework.

Framework VIII (Framework 8) introduced the ability to display JPEG and .BMP files and to load such files into Framework databases.

Of particular importance, all of the Selections and Functions&#x27; versions of Framework added the ability to share &quot;cut and paste&quot; (memory buffer data) between Windows and Framework. For detailed feature lists and screen shots see the Framework homepage listed below.

Selections and Functions continues to sell Framework — though no price is available publicly.

== Components ==
In addition to frame types with compiled executable code, the current versions, 9 and 10, Framework IX, and Framework X, which run in virtual mode on a thunking platform includes a dynamic link library file (.FWL) that contain 32 bit flat memory GUI/API code that can be called by FRED as a function to run on the host operating system accepting parameters and returning a value. Present versions include the FrameworkPascal compiler, which extend Framework making it possible to compile .FWL filed that access Windows API.

The spreadsheet program was superior in its day, offering true 3D capability, where spreadsheets could form an outline which can be &quot;opened&quot; to reveal a separate spreadsheet, as well as other frame types — a feat of sheer convenient function never again seen and further enhanced in later versions.

Framework&#x27;s built-in interpreter, the FRED (Frame Editor) computer language, was based on Lisp eval function. It can reference all frames and types across the product and can sense and perform all user interface operations.

== Compatibility ==
Framework works on most versions of Microsoft Windows. Framework 7 was the last version which can be run on Windows 95/98/ME or on DOS. Framework 8 and 9 were designed to run on Windows XP, but not in Windows 9x or DOS. Official updates are provided to run Framework on Windows 7 and 8. Framework VIII, Framework IX and Framework 10 runs in a thunking virtual machine platform integrated with the latest version of Windows.

==Reception==
Stating that &quot;Every module has been improved&quot;, &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 said while not revolutionary like previous versions, &quot;Framework III is a good choice for anyone with a limited budget who isn&#x27;t afraid of real power&quot;. The magazine criticized Ashton-Tate&#x27;s new marketing of the suite as &quot;&#x27;decision support software&#x27;, whatever that means&quot;, and said that &quot;FRED is [still] probably the most difficult macro language around&quot;.

<doc id="326114" wikidata="Q4824488" url="?curid=326114" title="Australian Natives' Association">
<text>The Australian Natives&#x27; Association (ANA) was a mutual society founded in Melbourne, Australia in April 1871. It was founded by and for the benefit of White native-born Australians, and membership was restricted to that group.

The Association&#x27;s objectives were to &quot;raise funds by subscription, donations ... for the purpose of relieving sick members, and defraying expenses of funeral of members and their wives, relieving distressed widows and orphans and for the necessary expenses of the general management of the Society.&quot;

The organisation had up to 95,000 members and provided benefits to 250,000 people, which were members and their families. While the ANA was legally required to have no affiliation with any political party, it was socially active. It provided strong support for the Federation of Australia, sport, afforestation, social well-being and the Federal Government&#x27;s restricted immigration policy, later referred to as the White Australia policy. The ANA and Manchester Unity agreed to merge to form Australian Unity in 1990. After the merger, social and educative functions continue in the ANA Fraternal organisation. The last remaining branch of the ANA closed in 2007 in Western Australia.

==Background==

The formation of the Australian Natives Association was a multi-stage process. It comes after the creation of the six Australian colonies, the discovery of significant quantities of gold with the wealth that was brought, and the increasing number of locally born citizens. The initial idea was to form a Friendly Society to provide help in sickness and distress solely for Melbourne-born citizens.

&quot;&quot;Melbourne Natives&quot; desirous of forming a society for the protection and promotion of their interests are requested to attend a meeting on Monday evening, 8 o&#x27;clock, at Grimwood&#x27;s Hotel, Elizabeth St. Formation of a Society.&quot;

== Victorian Natives&#x27; Association ==
The 24 April 1871 meeting had 14 men in attendance, who resolved to form a Friendly Society of Victorian Natives. A committee was established and several committee meetings and another public meeting, registration as a Friendly Society was gained on 4 May 1871. At 5 June meeting, it was agreed the objects were &quot;To promote the social and intellectual improvement of its members&quot;.

===ANA Day===

Around the end of the 19th century, the Victorian association advocated for a kind of forerunner of what is today Australia Day, to be celebrated on 26 January as a public holiday and the national day. This subsequently became known as ANA Day in Victoria, but was not taken up by the other states until 1935, and renamed Australia Day.&quot;...What the people celebrate on Australia Day is not the coming into being of the Australian Commonwealth, for that befell on New Year’s Day; and not May 9, when the first Parliament of the Commonwealth commenced its sittings; but January 26, the day in 1788 when the first permanent white settlers, being Captain Arthur Phillip’s officials, marines and transported convicts from England, landed on the shores of Sydney Cove.&quot;

== Australian Natives&#x27; Association ==
In 1872, it was voted to extend membership to men born in the other Australian colonies and to change the name at the same time. The association started to grow and form new branches initially around Melbourne and then in the golds fields towns of Ballarat and Sandhurst (now Bendigo) in 1874 and Neangor (now Eaglehawk) 1876. In 1878 the Sandhurst branch initiated a motion that the Association allow having debates or essays at the meetings after the business had been completed. The membership population centre of the Association moved to the gold fields towns west of Melbourne as the membership of these branches grew. The administration also moved West with the election of F. C. Wainwright, a member in Ballarat, as General Secretary in 1881. As the Association grew, it was decided in 1890 to move administration back to Melbourne. The Association played a leading role in the movement for Australian federation in the last 20 years of the 19th century. In 1900, it had a membership of 17,000, mainly in Victoria.

The ANA provided sickness, medical, and funeral cover. Membership in the ANA was restricted to men born in Australia, at a time when Australian-born people of European descent (not including Indigenous Australians) were rising to power in place of an older generation born in Britain. In the 1890s, for the first time, the native-born became the majority of the population.

The organisation received criticism for their name, including from Aboriginal leader and activist William Cooper over the appropriation of the term &#x27;native&#x27;.

Former Chief President James Hume Cook described as &quot;three great principles&quot; of the A.N.A:The maintenance of a White Australia.

The Made-in-Australia movement.

The broadening of the Commonwealth Constitution.

==Chief Presidents==

With the establishment of a growing number of branches, including some outside Melbourne, a conference was held in 1874 to plan for centralised administration of the ANA. From 1877 the ANA was placed under the control of a board of directors to be presided over by a chief president. From 1877 onwards, the ANA elected a chief president at their annual conference held in different cities each year. There were four instances when the conference was not annual and the Chief President served for two years — the first two terms and twice due to the Second World War.

== New Zealand Natives&#x27; Association ==
With the 1880 public consideration of Australian colonies and New Zealand federating, there was discussion of forming a New Zealand branch of the ANA. The Victorian ANA Board of Directors considered forming branches in Wellington, Westport, and Auckland, but the legislative hurdles caused by the differing legislation in the two colonies were insurmountable. A separate organisation, the New Zealand Natives Association (NZNA) was formed 30 April 1897. The Wellington branch grew satisfactorily, reaching 245 members within a year. At its peak it reached 2,500 members. In 1900 while the Australian federation was not to include New Zealand, the New Zealand Natives Association voted to allow Australians to become members. Apart from differing legislation, limitations in communications technologies of the time made thoughts of amalgamating ANA and NZNA impractical. In 1904, the Wellington Branch experienced significant difficulties and despite the offer from Victorian ANA to support it as if it were one of their own branches, the Wellington Branch disbanded in June 1905. The ANA met the deficiency of £8/10/- so all creditors were paid. Over the next twenty or so years, several attempts were made to align the New Zealand branches with the ANA, but all failed.

==Federation==

In 1885, the ANA committed itself to the federation of the Australian colonies, in response to what was seen as the threat of foreign incursion into the Pacific. The organisation avoided party politics, but they soon adopted the rising liberal politician and ANA member Alfred Deakin as their candidate for leadership of the federal movement. The membership certificate of 1891 shows many of the emblems of the federation such as the Australian Flag, the words &quot;Prosperity&quot;, &quot;Unity,&quot; &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Federation&quot;, a globe of the world showing Australia as a single entity, self-sufficiency through successful industry, and the ANA coat of arms featuring the kangaroo and emu.

In 1891, when the Victorian Parliament was considering the federation bill, the ANA organised public meetings around the colony to rally support for the bill, many of them addressed by Deakin. The ANA continued to campaign following the failure of the 1891 bill. From 1893 the association provided much of the organisational and financial support for the Federation Leagues which led the campaign, particularly in Victoria. When the movement revived after 1897, the ANA campaigned for the referendums to approve the proposed constitution. With federation achieved in 1901, the ANA withdrew from political activity, although it continued other activities such as promoting the observance of Australia Day. Other national issues supported by the ANA included afforestation, an Australian-made goods policy, water conservation, and the celebration of &#x27;proper and meaningful&#x27; citizenship ceremonies following the increased levels of migration after World War II. The ANA also supported the adoption of the wattle as the national floral emblem in 1912.

==Culture==
In the late 1880s, an ANA-sponsored literary and musical competition was mooted by several Victorian branches, along the lines of that run by the South Street Society and, like that organisation, originating in Ballarat, there the first such event took place on Foundation Day, 26 January 1892; Calder Smith and C. R. Church being among those credited with its successful launch, with Ballarat&#x27;s &quot;Star&quot; newspaper a strong supporter.
The literary competition was dropped early, but the vocal competitions were prominent in Australia&#x27;s cultural calendar for over thirty years.
In 1927 the 38th, and final, ANA musical and elocutionary competitions were held in Melbourne.

==Female membership==
The ANA was wary of admitting female members, on the basis that at the time males were predominately the primary income earners. At the 1896 Daylesford Conference, the Clifton Hill branch presented a motion instructing the Board to take steps for form a Friendly Society similar to the ANA for Australian-born females. At the 1897 Castlemaine Conference, a detailed report was provided that showed:
* 168,757 native born women between the age of 15 and 40 years;
* an estimate of 109,000 women eligible to join a Society was given.
A motion to allow women to join the ANA was defeated.

The 1899 Port Fairy Conference heard that between the 1871 and 1891 censuses, female primary income earners had increased from 52,243 to 114,804. In November 1899 the Board supported the creation of a Friendly Society for women. In August of 1900, the Constitution and Bye Laws for the society were approved, and then registered in September.

In November of 1900, the Australasian Women&#x27;s Association (AWA) was formed. The ANA absorbed all the expenses of setting up the Association. The ANA and AWA worked closely together and at times jointly published document listing key office holder.

The changing circumstances after WW2 and the greater involvement of the Federal Government in providing social supports started to challenge Friendly Societies including the AWA. In 1955, the ANA began taking steps to enable AWA members to transfer to the ANA, and this came to fruition in 1964. A past AWA Chief President, Mrs. I. V. Meagher, became the first woman Chief President of the ANA in 1977.

==White Australia policy==
Alongside the Returned and Services League, the ANA was one of the last Australian groups to support the White Australia Policy. While this policy was wound down in the decades after the Second World War and totally abolished by 1970, a few members continued to support it until the 1970s.

==Later years==
The ANA continued to operate a private health fund, a building society, general insurance company and small-scale life insurance and fund management activities. In 1993, it merged those operations with Manchester Unity IOOF of Victoria to create Australian Unity, the largest friendly society in Australia by number of members.

In 2007, the Mosman Park WA Branch of the ANA closed down; the building owned by the chapter was sold, and the proceeds distributed among the groups remaining 320 members. The ANA continues though ANA Fraternal which is a continuation of the Metropolitan Committee.

== New Australian Natives&#x27; Association ==
The Australian Natives Association (ANA), run by Matthew Grant, claims on its website to be a revived version of the ANA. According to its Charter of Principles, the ANA is for &quot;the cultivation of an Australian sentiment based on the maintenance of European-descent ethnic homogeneity; the development in Australia of a self-reliant ethnocentric community existing in parallel to preexisting institutions; and the promotion in Australia of patriarchal family order.&quot; The ANA has also written about how members feel &quot;atomized in an ocean of migrants and rootless &#x27;globetrotters&#x27;&quot;. It claims that it is leading its people &quot;down the road to cultural renewal&quot;. It has been classified by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) as a far-right hate and extremist group, with an anti-immigrant, white nationalist, anti-woman ideology.

=== Views on Australian identity ===
The ANA claimed that an &quot;Aboriginal&quot; cannot be an Australian because &quot;Australia&quot; as a nation is &quot;truly a European-born construct&quot;.&quot;Australian&quot; identity is not handed out to people by merit of living upon this soil, &quot;Australian&quot; identity is inseparable from the English-speaking European descent peoples whom colonised this land and forged a unique cultural and ethnic identity.

No Asian, African or Pacific Islander can be an Australian, they may very well live on this soil – but they by no means can ever truly identify as an Australian: our identity is inseparable from history, culture and genealogy.

=== Views on racial bigotry and Nazism ===
The ANA, although expressing a devout conviction for the return of the White Australia policy due to concerns for the &quot;social impacts&quot; of immigration, has stated that &quot;all men (even aliens) should be treated with basic dignity unless they have proven themselves worthy of something less&quot;. The Association has publicly opposed the &quot;fetishisation&quot; and &quot;copying&quot; of what it considers foreign ideologies, such as Neo-Nazism:
Those who carbon-copy foreign symbolism, ideology and fetishize foreign personalities above those of our own venerable history have ceased to be Nationalists. Well-intentioned racialists who have transcended nationality and ethnicity which sees a stronger connection to the Ku Klux Klan or Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich than to Australia cannot be reconciled with an Australian-centric worldview. They, like many others are a product of globalisation.

==The Advance Australia magazine ==
Between 1897 and 1919, the ANA published the monthly &quot;The Advance Australia&quot; magazine.

<doc id="326115" wikidata="Q206998" url="?curid=326115" title="Erica (plant)">
<text>Erica is a genus of roughly 857 species of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. The English common names heath and [[Ericaceae|heather]] are shared by some closely related genera of similar appearance. The genus &quot;Calluna&quot; was formerly included in &quot;Erica&quot; – it differs in having even smaller scale-leaves (less than 2–3 millimetres long), and the flower corolla consisting of separate petals. &quot;Erica&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;winter (or spring) heather&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;Calluna&quot; &quot;summer (or autumn) heather&quot;.

==Description==
Most of the species of &quot;Erica&quot; are small shrubs from high, though some are taller; the tallest are &quot;E. arborea&quot; (tree heath) and &quot;E. scoparia&quot; (besom heath), both of which can reach up to tall. All are evergreen, with minute, needle-like leaves long. Flowers are sometimes axillary, and sometimes borne in terminal umbels or spikes, and are usually outward or downward facing. The seeds are very small, and in some species may survive in the soil for decades.

==Taxonomy==
Dulfer published the last revision of the genus &quot;Erica&quot; in the 1960s, treating 605 species. Many new species have subsequently been described (particularly in South Africa) and a further 83 have been included in &quot;Erica&quot; from former &quot;minor genera&quot;, such as &quot;Phillipia&quot; Klotzsch and &quot;Blaeria&quot; L. A more recent overview of &quot;Erica&quot; species is provided in an electronic identification aid, but a modern taxonomic revision of the genus as a whole is still lacking.

=== Phylogeny ===
A number of increasingly detailed phylogenetic hypotheses for &quot;Erica&quot; have been published based on nuclear ribosomal and plastid DNA sequences. The closest relatives of &quot;Erica&quot; are &quot;Daboecia&quot; (one or two species) and &quot;Calluna&quot; (monospecific), representing the oldest surviving lineages of a, by inference, ancestrally Palearctic tribe Ericeae. The small number of European &quot;Erica&quot; species represent the oldest lineages of the genus, within which a single, order-of-magnitude more species-rich, African clade is nested. Within the African clade, Cape and Madagascan/Mascarene species respectively represent monophyletic groups.

===Species===

Selected species include:


=== Etymology ===
The Latin word &quot;erica&quot; means &quot;heath&quot; or &quot;broom&quot;. It is believed that Pliny adapted &quot;erica&quot; from Ancient Greek ἐρείκη. The expected Anglo-Latin pronunciation, , may be given in dictionaries (&quot;OED&quot;: &quot;Erica&quot;), but is more commonly heard.

==Distribution and habitat==
Around 690 of the species are endemic to South Africa, and these are often called the Cape heaths, forming the largest genus in the fynbos. The remaining species are native to other parts of Africa, Madagascar, the Mediterranean, and Europe.

Like most Ericaceae, &quot;Erica&quot; species are mainly calcifuges, being limited to acidic or very acidic soils. In fact, the term &quot;ericaceous&quot; is frequently applied to all calcifuges, and to the compost used in their cultivation. Soils range from dry, sandy soils to extremely wet ones such as bog. They often dominate dwarf-shrub habitats (heathland and moorland), or the ground vegetation of open acidic woodland.

==Ecology==
Plants of this genus are eaten mainly by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Saturnia pavonia&quot;, garden tiger moth, true lover&#x27;s knot, wormwood pug, the silver-studded blue, and the &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers &quot;C. juncicolella&quot; and &quot;C. pyrrhulipennella&quot;.

Some species of sunbirds are known to visit and pollinate &quot;Erica&quot;. Two such species are the southern double-collared sunbird and the orange-breasted sunbird.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Erica&quot; species are grown as landscape or garden plants for their floral effect. They associate well with conifers and are frequently seen in planting schemes as massed groundcover beneath varieties of dwarf conifers. They are capable of producing flower colour throughout the year. They can also be grown in tubs or window boxes to provide interest through autumn and into winter.

The cultivation of larger beds of heath rather than individual plants became more popular in the 1920s, after gardeners began to try and replicate natural heathland environments in their gardens.

<text>IEC 60320 Appliance couplers for household and similar general purposes is a set of standards from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) specifying non-locking connectors for connecting power supply cords to electrical appliances of voltage not exceeding 250 V (a.c.) and rated current not exceeding 16 A. Different types of connector (distinguished by shape and size) are specified for different combinations of current, temperature and earthing requirements. Unlike IEC 60309 connectors, they are not coded for voltage; users must ensure that the voltage rating of the equipment is compatible with the mains supply. The standard uses the term &quot;coupler&quot; to encompass connectors on power cords and power inlets and outlets built into appliances.

The first edition of IEC 320 was published in 1970 and was renumbered to 60320 in 1994.

==Terminology==

&quot;Appliance couplers&quot; enable the use of standard inlets and country-specific cord sets which allow manufacturers to produce the same appliance for many markets, where only the cord set has to be changed for a particular market. &quot;Interconnection couplers&quot; allow a power supply from a piece of equipment or an appliance to be made available to other equipment or appliances. Couplers described under these standards have standardized current and temperature ratings.

The parts of the couplers are defined in the standard as follows.
* &quot;Connector&quot;: &quot;part of the appliance coupler integral with, or intended to be attached to, one cord connected to the supply&quot;.
* &quot;Appliance inlet&quot;: &quot;part of the appliance coupler integrated as a part of an appliance or incorporated as a separate part in the appliance or equipment or intended to be fixed to it&quot;.
* &quot;Plug connector&quot;: &quot;part of the interconnection coupler integral with or intended to be attached to one cord&quot;.
* &quot;Appliance outlet&quot;: &quot;part of the interconnection coupler which is the part integrated or incorporated in the appliance or equipment or intended to be fixed to it and from which the supply is obtained&quot;.
* &quot;Cord set&quot;: &quot;assembly consisting of one cable or cord fitted with one non-rewirable plug and one non-rewirable connector, intended for the connection of an electrical appliance or equipment to the electrical supply&quot;.
* &quot;Interconnection cord set&quot;: &quot;assembly consisting of one cable or cord fitted with one non-rewirable plug connector and one non-rewirable connector, intended for the interconnection between two electrical appliances&quot;.

Non-rewirable plugs and connectors are typically permanently molded onto cords and cannot be removed or rewired without cutting the cords.

The standard uses the terms &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; only for individual pins and socket contacts, but in general usage they are also applied to the complete plugs and connectors. &quot;Connectors&quot; and &quot;appliance outlets&quot; are fitted with socket contacts, and &quot;appliance inlets&quot; and &quot;plug connectors&quot; are fitted with pin contacts.

Each type of coupler is identified by a standard sheet number. For appliance couplers this consists of the letter &quot;C&quot; followed by a number, where the standard sheet for the appliance inlet is 1 higher than the sheet for the corresponding cable connector. Many types of coupler also have common names. The most common ones are &quot;IEC connector&quot; for the common C13 and C14, the &quot;figure-8 connector&quot; for C7 and C8, and &quot;cloverleaf connector&quot; or &quot;Mickey Mouse connector&quot; for the C5/C6. &quot;Kettle plug&quot; (often &quot;jug plug&quot; in Australian or New Zealand English) is a colloquial term used for the high-temperature C16 appliance inlet (and sometimes for C15 connector that the plug goes into). “Kettle/jug plug” is also informally used to refer to regular temperature-rated C13 and C14 connectors. (A high-temperature-rated cord with a C15 connector can be used to power a computer with a C14 plug, but a cord with a low-temperature C13 connector will not fit a high-temperature appliance that has a C16 plug.)

==Application==
Detachable appliance couplers are used in office equipment, measuring instruments, IT environments, and medical devices, among many types of equipment for worldwide distribution. Each appliance&#x27;s power system must be adapted to the different plugs used in different regions. An appliance with a permanently-attached plug for use in one country cannot be readily sold in another which uses an incompatible wall socket; this requires keeping track of variations throughout the product&#x27;s life cycle from assembly and testing to shipping and repairs.

Instead, a country-specific power supply cord can be included in the product packaging, so that model variations are minimized and factory testing is simplified. A cord which is fitted with non-rewireable (usually moulded) connectors at both ends is termed a &quot;cord set&quot;. Appliance manufacturing may be simplified by mounting an appliance coupler directly on the printed circuit board. Assembly and handling of an appliance is easier if the power cord can be removed without much effort.

Appliances can be used in another country easily, with a simple change of the power supply cord (including a connector and a country-specific plug). The power supply cord can be replaced easily if damaged, because it is a standardized part that can be unplugged and re-inserted. Safety hazards, maintenance expenditure and repairs are minimized.

==Standards==

===Parts of the standard===
IEC 60320 is divided into several parts:
* IEC 60320-1: General Requirements specifies two-pole and two-pole with earth couplers intended for the connection of a mains supply cord to electrical appliances. Beginning with the IEC 60320-1:2015 edition, this part also specifies interconnection couplers which enable the connection and disconnection of an appliance to a cord leading to another appliance, incorporating IEC 60320-2-2. At the same time, this part of the standard no longer includes standard sheets which were moved to a new part: IEC 60320-3.
* IEC 60320-2-1: Sewing machine couplers specifies couplers which are not interchangeable with other couplers from IEC 60320, for use with household sewing machines. They are rated no higher than 2.5 A and 250 V AC.
* IEC 60320-2-2: Interconnection couplers for household and similar equipment. This section was withdrawn in January 2016. The general requirements for these items were incorporated into IEC 60320-1 and the standard sheets were moved to IEC 60320-3.
* IEC 60320-2-3: Couplers with a degree of protection higher than IPX0 specifies couplers with some degree of liquid ingress protection (IP). In its second edition published in 2018, the standard sheets were moved to IEC 60320-3.
* IEC 60320-2-4: Couplers dependent on appliance weight for engagement.
* IEC 60320-3: Standard sheets and gauges. First published October 31, 2014, this part initially included the standard sheets for both appliance couplers and interconnection couplers. In a 2018 amendment, the standard sheets for the IP couplers defined by 60320-2-3 were added. For appliance couplers the various coupler outlines are designated using a combination of letters and numbers, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;C14&quot;. The &quot;connector&quot; supplies power to the &quot;appliance inlet&quot;. The appliance inlet is designated by the even number one greater than the number assigned to the connector, so a C1 connector mates with a C2 inlet, and a C15A mates with a C16A. Interconnection couplers have single letter designators, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;F&quot;. They consist of a &quot;plug connector&quot; and an &quot;appliance outlet&quot;. The plug connector is the part integral with, or intended to be attached to, the cord, and the appliance outlet is the part integrated with or incorporated into the appliance or equipment or intended to be fixed to it, and from which the supply is obtained.

===Contents of standards===
The standards define the mechanical, electrical and thermal requirements and safety goals of power couplers. The standard scope is limited to appliance couplers with a rated voltage not exceeding 250 V (a.c.) at 50 Hz or 60 Hz, and a rated current not exceeding 16 A. Further sub-parts of IEC 60320 focus on special topics such as protection ratings and appliance specific requirements.

Selection of a coupler depends in part on the IEC appliance classes. The shape and dimensions of appliance inlets and connectors are coordinated so that a connector with lower current rating, temperature rating, or polarization cannot be inserted into an appliance inlet that requires higher ratings. (i.e. a Protection Class II connector cannot mate with a Class I inlet which requires an earth); whereas connecting a Class I connector to a Class II appliance inlet is possible because it creates no safety hazard.

Pin temperature is measured where the pin projects from the engagement surface. The maximum permitted pin temperatures, are , , and , respectively (the higher temperatures are not applicable to interconnection couplers). The pin temperature is determined by the design of the appliance, and its interior temperature, rather than by its ambient temperature. Typical applications with increased pin temperatures include appliances with heating coils such as ovens or electric grills. It is generally possible to use a connector with a higher rated temperature with a lower rated appliance inlet, but the keying feature of the inlet prevents use of a connector with a lower temperature rating.

Connectors are also classified according to the method of connecting the cord, either as rewirable connectors or non-rewirable connectors.

In addition the standards define further general criteria such as withdrawal forces, testing procedures, the minimum number of insertion cycles, and the number of flexings of cords.

IEC 60320-1 defines a &quot;cord set&quot; as an &quot;assembly consisting of one cable or cord fitted with one plug and one connector, intended for the connection of an electrical appliance or equipment to the electrical supply&quot;. It also defines an &quot;interconnection cord set&quot; as an &quot;assembly consisting of one cable or cord fitted with one plug connector and one connector, intended for the interconnection between two electrical appliances&quot;.

In addition to the connections within the standards, as mentioned, there are possible combinations between appliance couplers and IEC interconnection couplers. Fitted with a flexible cord, the components become interconnection cords to be used for connecting appliances or for extending other interconnection cords or power supply cords.

==North American ratings==
North American rating agencies (CSA, NOM-ANCE, and UL) will certify IEC 60320 connectors for higher currents than are specified in the IEC standard itself. In particular, UL will certify:
* C5/C6 connectors for up to 13 A, although 10 A is more commonly seen (IEC maximum is 2.5 A)
* C7/C8 connectors for up to 10 A (IEC maximum is 2.5 A)
* C13/C14 and C15/C16 connectors for up to 15 A (IEC maximum is 10 A)
* C19/C20 and C21/C22 connectors for up to 20 A (IEC maximum is 16 A)

Given the 120 V (±5%) mains supply used in the United States and Canada, these higher ratings permit devices with C6 and C8 inputs to draw more than 114 V × 2.5 A = 285 W from the mains, and devices with C14 inputs to draw more than 1140 W from the mains.

This is exploited by high-powered computer power supplies, up to 1200 W output, and even some particularly efficient 1500 W output models to use the more popular C14 input on products sold worldwide.

Although less common, power bricks with C6 and C8 inputs and ratings up to 300 W also exist.

==Appliance couplers==
The dimensions and tolerances for connectors, appliance inlets, appliance outlets and plug connectors are given in standard sheets, which are dimensioned drawings showing the features required for safety and interchangeability.

===Mains appliance couplers===
The mains appliance couplers are all engineered to connect an appliance via a power cord to mains power.

==== C1/C2 coupler====


The C1 coupler and C2 inlet were commonly used for mains-powered electric shavers. These have largely been supplanted by cordless shavers with rechargeable batteries or corded shavers with an AC adapter.

==== C5/C6 coupler====


This coupler is sometimes colloquially called a &quot;cloverleaf&quot; or &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; coupler (because the cross section resembles the silhouette of the Disney character).

The C6 inlet is used on laptop power supplies and portable projectors, as well as on some desktop computers, and some LCD monitors.

==== C7/C8 coupler====


Commonly known as a &quot;figure-8&quot;, &quot;infinity&quot; or &quot;shotgun&quot; connector due to the shape of its cross-section, or less commonly, a Telefunken connector after its originator.
This coupler is often used for small cassette recorders, battery/mains-operated radios, battery chargers, some full-size audio-visual equipment, laptop computer power supplies, video game consoles, and similar double-insulated appliances.

A C8B inlet type is defined by the standard for use by dual-voltage appliances; it has three pins and can hold a C7 connector in either of two positions, allowing the user to select voltage by choosing the position the connector is inserted.

A similar but polarized connector has been made, but is not part of the standard. Sometimes called C7P, it is asymmetrical, with one side squared. Unpolarized C7 connectors can be inserted into the polarized inlets; however, doing so might be a safety risk if the device is designed for polarized power. Although not specified by IEC 60320, and not clear whether any formal written standard exists, the most common wiring appears to connect the rounded side to the hot (live) line, and the squared to the neutral. Note: Clause 9.5 was added to IEC 60320-1:2015, this requires that &quot;It shall not be possible to engage a part of a non-standard appliance coupler with a complementary part of an appliance coupler complying with the standard sheets in any part of IEC 60320.&quot;
Apple uses a modified version of this connector, with the receptacle having a proprietary pin that secures the adapter in place and provides grounding. Most Apple supplied cable adapter provide grounding through a slide-in connector, while the angled AC adapter (&quot;duckhead&quot;) does not provide grounding, with North American plugs. These power supplies do accept the standard C7 connector, and supported by Apple for non-grounded applications.
==== C13/C14 coupler====


The C13/C14 connector and inlet combination are used in a wide variety of electronic equipment ranging from computer components like the power supply, monitors, printers and other peripherals to video game consoles, instrument amplifiers, professional audio equipment and virtually all professional video equipment. An early example of a product that uses this connector is the Apple II. A power cord with a suitable power plug (for the locality where the appliance is being used) on one end and a C13 connector (connecting to the appliance) on the other is commonly called an &quot;IEC cord&quot;.

There are also a variety of splitter blocks, splitter cables, and similar devices available. These are usually un-fused (with the exception of C13 cords attached to BS 1363 plugs, which are always fused).

These cables are sometimes informally referred to as a &quot;kettle cord&quot; or &quot;kettle lead&quot;, but the C13/14 connectors are only rated for : a device such as a kettle requires the C15/16 connector, rated for .

A cable consisting of a C13 and an E interconnection connector is commonly mislabeled as an &quot;extension cord&quot;, as although that is not the intended purpose, it can be used as such. They are also commonly mislabeled as C14 instead of E.

The C13 connector and C14 inlet are also commonly found on servers, routers, and switches. Power cord sets utilizing a C13 connector and an E interconnection plug are commonplace in data centers to provide power from a PDU (power distribution unit) to a server. These data-center power cables are now offered in many colors. Colored power cables are used to color-code installations.

==== C15/C16 coupler====

Some electric kettles and similar hot household appliances like home stills use a supply cord with a C15 connector and a matching C16 inlet on the appliance; their temperature rating is rather than the of the similar C13/C14 combination. The official designation in Europe for the C15/C16 coupler is a &quot;hot-condition&quot; coupler.

These are similar in form to the C13/C14 coupler, except with a ridge opposite the earth in the C16 inlet (preventing a C13 fitting), and a corresponding valley in the C15 connector (which doesn&#x27;t prevent it fitting a C14 inlet). For example, an electric kettle cord can be used to power a computer, but an unmodified computer cord cannot be used to power a kettle.

There is some public confusion between C13/C14 and C15/C16 couplers, and it is not uncommon for C13/C14 to be informally referred to as &quot;kettle plug&quot; or &quot;kettle lead&quot; (or some local equivalent).

In European countries the C15/C16 coupler has replaced and made obsolete the formerly common types of national appliance coupler in many applications.

==== C15A/C16A coupler====
This modification of the C15/C16 coupler has an even higher temperature rating.

==== C17/C18 coupler====


Similar to C13/C14 coupler, but unearthed. A C18 inlet accepts a C13 connector, but a C14 inlet does not accept a C17 connector.

The IBM Wheelwriter series of electronic typewriters are one common application. Three-wire cords with C13 connectors, which are easier to find, are sometimes used in place of the two-wire cords for replacement. In this case, the ground wire will not be connected.

The C17/C18 coupler is often used in audio applications where a floating ground is maintained to eliminate hum caused by ground loops. Other common applications are the power supplies of Xbox 360 game consoles, replacing the C15/C16 coupler employed initially, and large CRT televisions manufactured by RCA in the early 1990s.

==== C19/C20 coupler====


Earthed, 16 A, polarized. This coupler is used for supplying power in IT applications where higher currents are required, for instance on high-power workstations and servers, power to uninterruptible power supplies, power to some power distribution units, large network routers, switches, blade enclosures, and similar equipment. This connector can also be found on high-current medical equipment. It is rectangular and has pins parallel to the long axis of the coupler face.

===Interconnection couplers===
Interconnection couplers are similar to appliance couplers, but with the gender roles reversed. Specifically, the female appliance outlet is built into a piece of equipment, while the male plug connector is attached to a cord. They are identified by letters, not numbers, with one letter identifying the plug connector, and the alphabetical next letter identifying the mating appliance outlet. For example, an E plug fits into an F outlet. Beginning with an amendment published in 2022, three of the commonly used high temperature variants have been standardized as types M–R.


Cables with a C13 connector at one end and a type E plug connector at the other are commonly available. They have a variety of common uses, including connecting power between older PCs and their monitors, extending existing power cords, connecting to type F outlets strips (commonly used with rack-mount gear to save space and for international standardization) and connecting computer equipment to the output of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Type J outlets are used in a similar way.

===Withdrawn and other standard sheets===
C3, C4, C11 and C12 standard sheets are no longer listed in the standard.

Standard sheet C25 shows retaining device dimensions. Sheet C26 shows detail dimensions for pillar-type terminals, where the end of the screw bears on a wire directly or through a pressure plate. Sheet 27 shows details for screw terminals, where the wire is held by wrapping it around the head of a screw.

<text>Windows 7 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and became generally available on October 22, 2009. It is the successor to Windows Vista, released nearly three years earlier. Windows 7&#x27;s server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2, was released at the same time. It was succeeded by Windows 8 in October 2012.

Extended support ended on January 14, 2020, over 10 years after the release of Windows 7, after which the operating system ceased receiving further updates. A paid support program was available for enterprises, providing security updates for Windows 7 for up to three years since the official end of life.

Windows 7 was intended to be an incremental upgrade to Windows Vista, addressing the previous OS&#x27;s poor reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility as well as fixing some of Vista&#x27;s inconsistencies (such as Vista&#x27;s aggressive User Account Control). Windows 7 continued improvements on the Windows Aero user interface with the addition of a redesigned taskbar that allows pinned applications, and new window management features. Other new features were added to the operating system, including libraries, the new file-sharing system HomeGroup, and support for multitouch input. A new &quot;Action Center&quot; was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information, and tweaks were made to the User Account Control system to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player, and Windows Media Center.

Unlike Windows Vista, Windows 7 received warm reception among reviewers and consumers with critics considering the operating system to be a major improvement over its predecessor because of its improved performance, its more intuitive interface, fewer User Account Control popups, and other improvements made across the platform. Windows 7 was a major success for Microsoft; even before its official release, pre-order sales for the operating system on the online retailer Amazon.com had surpassed previous records. In just six months, over 100 million copies had been sold worldwide, increasing to over 630 million licenses by July 2012. By January 2018, Windows 10 surpassed Windows 7 as the most popular version of Windows worldwide. Windows 11 overtook Windows 7 as the second most popular Windows version on all continents in August 2022. , just 3% of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 7, although it remains relatively popular in parts of the world, such as China (where it is tied with Windows 11), and is second most popular in some countries.

It is the final version of Microsoft Windows that supports processors without SSE2 or NX (although an update released in 2018 dropped support for non-SSE2 processors).

== Naming ==
Windows 7 is the successor to Windows Vista, and its version name is Windows NT 6.1, compared to Vista&#x27;s NT 6.0; its naming caused some confusion when it was announced in 2008. Windows president Steven Sinofsky commented that Windows 95 was the fourth version of Windows, but Windows 7 counts up from Windows NT 4.0 as it is a descendant of NT.

== Development history ==
Originally, a version of Windows codenamed &quot;Blackcomb&quot; was planned as the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 in 2000. Major features were planned for Blackcomb, including an emphasis on searching and querying data and an advanced storage system named WinFS to enable such scenarios. However, an interim, minor release, codenamed &quot;Longhorn,&quot; was announced for 2003, delaying the development of Blackcomb. By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb. After three major malware outbreaks—the Blaster, Nachi, and Sobig worms—exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time period in August 2003, Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting some of Longhorn&#x27;s major development work on hold while developing new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Development of Longhorn (Windows Vista) was also restarted, and thus delayed, in August 2004. A number of features were cut from Longhorn. Blackcomb was renamed Vienna in early 2006, and was later canceled in 2007 due to the scope of the project.

When released, Windows Vista was criticized for its long development time, performance issues, spotty compatibility with existing hardware and software at launch, changes affecting the compatibility of certain PC games, and unclear assurances by Microsoft that certain computers shipping with XP before launch would be &quot;Vista Capable&quot; (which led to a class-action lawsuit), among other critiques. As such, the adoption of Vista in comparison to XP remained somewhat low. In July 2007, following the shelving of the Vienna project and six months following the public release of Vista, it was reported that the next version of Windows would then be codenamed Windows 7, with plans for a final release within three years. Bill Gates, in an interview with &quot;Newsweek&quot;, suggested that Windows 7 would be more &quot;user-centric&quot;. Gates later said that Windows 7 would also focus on performance improvements. Steven Sinofsky later expanded on this point, explaining in the &quot;Engineering Windows 7&quot; blog that the company was using a variety of new tracing tools to measure the performance of many areas of the operating system on an ongoing basis, to help locate inefficient code paths and to help prevent performance regressions. Senior Vice President Bill Veghte stated that Windows Vista users migrating to Windows 7 would not find the kind of device compatibility issues they encountered migrating from Windows XP. An estimated 1,000 developers worked on Windows 7. These were broadly divided into &quot;core operating system&quot; and &quot;Windows client experience&quot;, in turn organized into 25 teams of around 40 developers on average.

In October 2008, it was announced that Windows 7 would also be the official name of the operating system. There had been some confusion over naming the product Windows 7, while versioning it as 6.1 to indicate its similar build to Windows Vista and increase compatibility with applications that only check major version numbers, similar to Windows 2000 and Windows XP both having 5.x version numbers. The first external release to select Microsoft partners came in January 2008 with Milestone 1, build 6519. Speaking about Windows 7 on October 16, 2008, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer confirmed compatibility between Windows Vista and Windows 7, indicating that Windows 7 would be a refined version of Windows Vista.

At PDC 2008, Microsoft demonstrated Windows 7 with its reworked taskbar. On December 27, 2008, the Windows 7 Beta was leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent. According to a performance test by ZDNet, Windows 7 Beta beat both Windows XP and Windows Vista in several key areas, including boot and shutdown time and working with files, such as loading documents. Other areas did not beat XP, including PC Pro benchmarks for typical office activities and video editing, which remain identical to Vista and slower than XP. On January 7, 2009, the x64 version of the Windows 7 Beta (build 7000) was leaked onto the web, with some torrents being infected with a trojan. At CES 2009, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the Windows 7 Beta, build 7000, had been made available for download to MSDN and TechNet subscribers in the format of an ISO image. The stock wallpaper of the beta version contained a digital image of the Betta fish.

The release candidate, build 7100, became available for MSDN and TechNet subscribers, and Connect Program participants on April 30, 2009. On May 5, 2009, it became available to the general public, although it had also been leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent. The release candidate was available in five languages and expired on June 1, 2010, with shutdowns every two hours starting March 1, 2010. Microsoft stated that Windows 7 would be released to the general public on October 22, 2009, less than three years after the launch of its predecessor. Microsoft released Windows 7 to MSDN and Technet subscribers on August 6, 2009. Microsoft announced that Windows 7, along with Windows Server 2008 R2, was released to manufacturing in the United States and Canada on July 22, 2009. Windows 7 build 7600.16385.090713-1255, which was compiled on July 13, 2009, was declared the final RTM build after passing all Microsoft&#x27;s tests internally.

== Features ==

=== New and changed ===

Among Windows 7&#x27;s new features are advances in touch and handwriting recognition, support for virtual hard disks, improved performance on multi-core processors, improved boot performance, DirectAccess, and kernel improvements. Windows 7 adds support for systems using multiple heterogeneous graphics cards from different vendors (Heterogeneous Multi-adapter), a new version of Windows Media Center, a Gadget for Windows Media Center, improved media features, XPS Essentials Pack, and Windows PowerShell being included, and a redesigned Calculator with multiline capabilities including &quot;Programmer&quot; and &quot;Statistics&quot; modes along with unit conversion for length, weight, temperature, and several others. Many new items have been added to the Control Panel, including ClearType Text Tuner, Display Color Calibration Wizard, Gadgets, Recovery, Troubleshooting, Workspaces Center, Location and Other Sensors, Credential Manager, Biometric Devices, System Icons, and Display. Windows Security Center has been renamed to Action Center (Windows Health Center and Windows Solution Center in earlier builds), which encompasses both security and maintenance of the computer. ReadyBoost on 32-bit editions now supports up to 256 gigabytes of extra allocation. Windows 7 also supports images in RAW image format through the addition of Windows Imaging Component-enabled image decoders, which enables raw image thumbnails, previewing and metadata display in Windows Explorer, plus full-size viewing and slideshows in Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Center. Windows 7 also has a native TFTP client with the ability to transfer files to or from a TFTP server.
The taskbar has seen the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been replaced with the ability to pin applications to the taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable &quot;Jump Lists&quot; to allow easy access to common tasks, and files frequently used with specific applications. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the &quot;Show desktop&quot; icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for a quick look at the desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.

Window management in Windows 7 has several new features: &quot;Aero Snap&quot; maximizes a window when it is dragged to the top, left, or right of the screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen, such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts. &quot;Aero Shake&quot; hides all inactive windows when the active window&#x27;s title bar is dragged back and forth rapidly.

Windows 7 includes 13 additional sound schemes, titled Afternoon, Calligraphy, Characters, Cityscape, Delta, Festival, Garden, Heritage, Landscape, Quirky, Raga, Savanna, and Sonata. Internet Spades, Internet Backgammon and Internet Checkers, which were removed in Windows Vista, were restored in Windows 7. Users are able to disable or customize many more Windows components than was possible in Windows Vista. New additions to this list of components include Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player 12, Windows Media Center, Windows Search, and Windows Gadget Platform. A new version of Microsoft Virtual PC, newly renamed as Windows Virtual PC was made available for Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions. It allows multiple Windows environments, including &quot;Windows XP Mode&quot;, to run on the same machine. Windows XP Mode runs Windows XP in a virtual machine, and displays applications within separate windows on the Windows 7 desktop. Furthermore, Windows 7 supports the mounting of a virtual hard disk (VHD) as a normal data storage, and the bootloader delivered with Windows 7 can boot the Windows system from a VHD; however, this ability is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) of Windows 7 is also enhanced to support real-time multimedia application including video playback and 3D games, thus allowing use of DirectX 10 in remote desktop environments. The three application limit, previously present in the Windows Vista and Windows XP Starter Editions, has been removed from Windows 7. All editions include some new and improved features, such as Windows Search, Security features, and some features new to Windows 7, that originated within Vista. Optional BitLocker Drive Encryption is included with Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise. Windows Defender is included; Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus software is a free download. All editions include Shadow Copy, which—every day or so—System Restore uses to take an automatic &quot;previous version&quot; snapshot of user files that have changed. Backup and restore have also been improved, and the Windows Recovery Environment—installed by default—replaces the optional Recovery Console of Windows XP.

A new system known as &quot;Libraries&quot; was added for file management; users can aggregate files from multiple folders into a &quot;Library.&quot; By default, libraries for categories such as Documents, Pictures, Music, and Video are created, consisting of the user&#x27;s personal folder and the Public folder for each. The system is also used as part of a new home networking system known as HomeGroup; devices are added to the network with a password, and files and folders can be shared with all other devices in the HomeGroup, or with specific users. The default libraries, along with printers, are shared by default, but the personal folder is set to read-only access by other users, and the Public folder can be accessed by anyone.

Windows 7 includes improved globalization support through a new Extended Linguistic Services API to provide multilingual support (particularly in Ultimate and Enterprise editions). Microsoft also implemented better support for solid-state drives, including the new TRIM command, and Windows 7 is able to identify a solid-state drive uniquely. Native support for USB 3.0 is not included because of delays in the finalization of the standard. At WinHEC 2008 Microsoft announced that color depths of 30-bit and 48-bit would be supported in Windows 7 along with the wide color gamut scRGB (which for HDMI 1.3 can be converted and output as xvYCC). The video modes supported in Windows 7 are 16-bit sRGB, 24-bit sRGB, 30-bit sRGB, 30-bit with extended color gamut sRGB, and 48-bit scRGB.

For developers, Windows 7 includes a new networking API with support for building SOAP-based web services in native code (as opposed to .NET-based WCF web services), new features to simplify development of installation packages and shorten application install times. Windows 7, by default, generates fewer User Account Control (UAC) prompts because it allows digitally signed Windows components to gain elevated privileges without a prompt. Additionally, users can now adjust the level at which UAC operates using a sliding scale.

=== Removed ===
Certain capabilities and programs that were a part of Windows Vista are no longer present or have been changed, resulting in the removal of certain functionalities; these include the classic Start Menu user interface, some taskbar features, Windows Explorer features, Windows Media Player features, Windows Ultimate Extras, Search button, and InkBall. Four applications bundled with Windows Vista—Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Movie Maker, Windows Calendar and Windows Mail—are not included with Windows 7 and were replaced by Windows Live-branded versions as part of the Windows Live Essentials suite.

== Editions ==

Windows 7 is available in six different editions, of which the &quot;Home Premium&quot;, &quot;Professional&quot;, and &quot;Ultimate&quot; were available at retail in most countries, and as pre-loaded software on most new computers. &quot;Home Premium&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot; were aimed at home users and small businesses respectively, while &quot;Ultimate&quot; was aimed at enthusiasts. Each edition of Windows 7 includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it, and adds additional features oriented towards their market segments; for example, &quot;Professional&quot; adds additional networking and security features such as Encrypting File System and the ability to join a domain. &quot;Ultimate&quot; contained a superset of the features from &quot;Home Premium&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot;, along with other advanced features oriented towards power users, such as BitLocker drive encryption; unlike Windows Vista, there were no &quot;Ultimate Extras&quot; add-ons created for Windows 7 Ultimate. Retail copies were available in &quot;upgrade&quot; and higher-cost &quot;full&quot; version licenses; &quot;upgrade&quot; licenses require an existing version of Windows to install, while &quot;full&quot; licenses can be installed on computers with no existing operating system.

The remaining three editions were not available at retail, of which two were available exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded software. The &quot;Starter&quot; edition is a stripped-down version of Windows 7 meant for low-cost devices such as netbooks. In comparison to Home Premium, Starter has reduced multimedia functionality, does not allow users to change their desktop wallpaper or theme, disables the &quot;Aero Glass&quot; theme, does not have support for multiple monitors, and can only address 2GB of RAM. &quot;Home Basic&quot; was sold only in emerging markets, and was positioned in between &quot;Home Premium&quot; and &quot;Starter&quot;. The highest edition, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, is functionally similar to &quot;Ultimate&quot;, but is only sold through volume licensing via Microsoft&#x27;s Software Assurance program.

All editions aside from &quot;Starter&quot; support both IA-32 and x86-64 architectures, &quot;Starter&quot; only supports 32-bit systems. Retail copies of Windows 7 are distributed on two DVDs: one for the IA-32 version and the other for x86-64. OEM copies include one DVD, depending on the processor architecture licensed. The installation media for consumer versions of Windows 7 are identical, the product key and corresponding license determines the edition that is installed. The Windows Anytime Upgrade service can be used to purchase an upgrade that unlocks the functionality of a higher edition, such as going from &quot;Starter&quot; to &quot;Home Premium&quot;, and &quot;Home Premium&quot; to &quot;Ultimate&quot;. Most copies of Windows 7 only contained one license; in certain markets, a &quot;Family Pack&quot; version of Windows 7 Home Premium was also released for a limited time, which allowed upgrades on up to three computers. In certain regions, copies of Windows 7 were only sold in, and could only be activated in a designated region.

== Support lifecycle ==
Support for the original release of Windows 7 (without a service pack) ended on April 9, 2013, requiring users to update to Windows 7 Service Pack 1 in order to continue receiving updates and support. Microsoft ended the sale of new retail copies of Windows 7 in October 2014, and the sale of new OEM licenses for Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium, and Ultimate ended on October 31, 2014. OEM sales of PCs with Windows 7 &quot;Professional&quot; pre-installed ended on October 31, 2016. The sale of non-Professional OEM licenses was stopped on October 31, 2014.

Mainstream support for Windows 7 ended on January 13, 2015. Extended support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020.

Variants of Windows 7 for embedded systems and thin clients have different support policies: Windows Embedded Standard 7 support ended in October 2020. Windows Thin PC and Windows Embedded POSReady 7 had support until October 2021.

In March 2019, Microsoft announced that it would display notifications to users informing users of the upcoming end of support, and direct users to a website urging them to purchase a Windows 10 upgrade or a new computer.

In August 2019, researchers reported that &quot;all modern versions of Microsoft Windows&quot; may be at risk for &quot;critical&quot; system compromise because of design flaws of hardware device drivers from multiple providers. In the same month, computer experts reported that the BlueKeep security vulnerability, , that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program&#x27;s Remote Desktop Protocol, allowing for the possibility of remote code execution, may now include related flaws, collectively named &quot;DejaBlue&quot;, affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., Windows 7 and all recent versions) as well. In addition, experts reported a Microsoft security vulnerability, , based on legacy code involving Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe), that affects all Windows versions from the older Windows XP version to the most recent Windows 10 versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.

In September 2019, Microsoft announced that it would provide free security updates for Windows 7 on federally-certified voting machines through the 2020 United States elections.

=== Extended Security Updates ===
On September 7, 2018, Microsoft announced a paid &quot;Extended Security Updates&quot; (ESU) service that will offer additional updates for Windows 7 &quot;Professional&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; for up to three years after the end of extended support, available via specific volume licensing programs in yearly installments.

Windows 7 Professional for Embedded Systems, Windows Embedded Standard 7, and Windows Embedded POSReady 7 also get Extended Security Updates for up to three years after their end of extended support date, via OEMs. The Extended Security Updates program for Windows Embedded POSReady 7 ended on October 8, 2024, marking the final end of IA-32 updates on the Windows NT 6.1 product line after more than 15 years.

In August 2019, Microsoft announced it would offer a year of &#x27;free&#x27; extended security updates to some business users.

=== Third-party support ===
In January 2023, version 109 of the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge became the last version of Edge to support Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. Alongside this, several other web browsers based on the Chromium codebase also dropped support for these operating systems after version 109, including Google Chrome and Opera. A fork of Chromium named Supermium is maintained for versions of Windows older than Windows 10, including Windows 7.

Mozilla maintains Firefox 115 Extended Support Release (ESR) to support Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. Mozilla has committed to support it until at least March 2025.

Steam ended support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 on January 1, 2024.

== System requirements ==
Additional requirements to use certain features:
* Windows XP Mode (Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise): Requires an additional 1 GB of RAM and additional 15 GB of available hard disk space. As of March 18, 2010, the requirement for a processor capable of hardware virtualization has been lifted.
* Windows Media Center (included in Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise), requires a TV tuner to receive and record TV.

=== Physical memory ===
The maximum amount of RAM that Windows 7 supports varies depending on the product edition and on the processor architecture, as shown in the following table.

=== Processor limits ===
Windows 7 Professional and up support up to 2 physical processors (CPU sockets), whereas Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, and Home Premium editions support only 1. Physical processors with either multiple cores, or hyper-threading, or both, implement more than one logical processor per physical processor. The x86 editions of Windows 7 support up to 32 logical processors; x64 editions support up to 256 (4 x 64).

== Extent of hardware support ==

In January 2016, Microsoft announced that it would no longer support Windows platforms older than Windows 10 on any future Intel-compatible processor lines, citing difficulties in reliably allowing the operating system to operate on newer hardware. Microsoft stated that effective July 17, 2017, devices with Intel Skylake CPUs were only to receive the &quot;most critical&quot; updates for Windows 7 and 8.1, and only if they have been judged not to affect the reliability of Windows 7 on older hardware. For enterprise customers, Microsoft issued a list of Skylake-based devices &quot;certified&quot; for Windows 7 and 8.1 in addition to Windows 10, to assist them in migrating to newer hardware that can eventually be upgraded to 10 once they are ready to transition. Microsoft and their hardware partners provide special testing and support for these devices on 7 and 8.1 until the July 2017 date.

On March 18, 2016, in response to criticism from enterprise customers, Microsoft delayed the end of support and non-critical updates for Skylake systems to July 17, 2018, but stated that they would also continue to receive security updates through the end of extended support. In August 2016, citing a &quot;strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel&quot;, Microsoft retracted the decision and stated that it would continue to support Windows 7 and 8.1 on Skylake hardware through the end of their extended support lifecycle. However, the restrictions on newer CPU microarchitectures remain in force.

In March 2017, a Microsoft knowledge base article announced which implies that devices using Intel Kaby Lake, AMD Bristol Ridge, or AMD Ryzen, would be blocked from using Windows Update entirely. In addition, official Windows 7 device drivers are not available for the Kaby Lake and Ryzen platforms.

Security updates released since March 2018 contained bugs that affect processors that do not support SSE2 extensions, including all Pentium III, Athlon XP, and prior processors. Microsoft initially stated that it would attempt to resolve this issue, and prevented installation of the affected patches on these systems. However, Microsoft retroactively modified its support documents on June 15, 2018 to remove the promise that this bug would be resolved, replacing it with a statement suggesting that users obtain a newer processor. This effectively ends further patch support for Windows 7 on these older systems.

== Updates ==

=== Service Pack 1 ===
Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) was announced on March 18, 2010. A beta was released on July 12, 2010. The final version was released to the public on February 22, 2011. At the time of release, it was not made mandatory. It was available via Windows Update, direct download, or by ordering the Windows 7 SP1 DVD. The service pack is on a much smaller scale than those released for previous versions of Windows, particularly Windows Vista.

Windows 7 Service Pack 1 adds support for Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX), a 256-bit instruction set extension for processors, and improves IKEv2 by adding additional identification fields such as E-mail ID to it. In addition, it adds support for Advanced Format 512e as well as additional Identity Federation Services. Windows 7 Service Pack 1 also resolves a bug related to HDMI audio and another related to printing XPS documents.

In Europe, the automatic nature of the BrowserChoice.eu feature was dropped in Windows 7 Service Pack 1 in February 2011 and remained absent for 14 months despite Microsoft reporting that it was still present, subsequently described by Microsoft as a &quot;technical error.&quot; As a result, in March 2013, the European Commission fined Microsoft €561 million to deter companies from reneging on settlement promises.

=== Platform Update ===
The Platform Update for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 was released on February 26, 2013 after a pre-release version had been released on November 5, 2012. It is also included with Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 7.

It includes enhancements to Direct2D, DirectWrite, Direct3D, Windows Imaging Component (WIC), Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform (WARP), Windows Animation Manager (WAM), XPS Document API, H.264 Video Decoder and JPEG XR decoder. However support for Direct3D 11.1 is limited as the update does not include DXGI/WDDM 1.2 from Windows 8, making unavailable many related APIs and significant features such as stereoscopic frame buffer, feature level 11_1 and optional features for levels 10_0, 10_1 and 11_0.

=== Disk Cleanup update ===
In October 2013, a Disk Cleanup Wizard addon was released that lets users delete outdated Windows updates on Windows 7 SP1, thus reducing the size of the WinSxS directory. This update backports some features found in Windows 8.

=== Windows Management Framework 5.0 ===
Windows Management Framework 5.0 includes updates to Windows PowerShell 5.0, Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC), Windows Remote Management (WinRM), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). It was released on February 24, 2016 and was eventually superseded by Windows Management Framework 5.1.

=== Convenience rollup ===
In May 2016, Microsoft released a &quot;Convenience rollup update for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1,&quot; which contains all patches released between the release of SP1 and April 2016. The rollup is not available via Windows Update, and must be downloaded manually. This package can also be integrated into a Windows 7 installation image.

Since October 2016, all security and reliability updates are cumulative. Downloading and installing updates that address individual problems is no longer possible, but the number of updates that must be downloaded to fully update the OS is significantly reduced.

=== Monthly update rollups (July 2016 – January 2020) ===
In June 2018, Microsoft announced that Windows 7 would be moved to a monthly update model beginning with updates released in September 2018, two years after Microsoft switched the rest of their supported operating systems to that model. With the new update model, instead of updates being released as they became available, only two update packages were released on the second Tuesday of every month until Windows 7 reached its end of life—one package containing security and quality updates, and a smaller package that contained only the security updates. Users could choose which package they wanted to install each month. Later in the month, another package would be released which was a preview of the next month&#x27;s security and quality update rollup.

Microsoft announced in July 2019 that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows XP and Windows Me would end on July 31, 2019 (and for Windows 7 on January 22, 2020).

The last non-extended security update rollup packages were released on January 14, 2020, the last day that Windows 7 had extended support.

=== End of support (after January 14, 2020) ===
On January 14, 2020, Windows 7 support ended with Microsoft no longer providing security updates or fixes after that date, except for subscribers of the Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESU), who were able to receive Windows 7 security updates through January 10, 2023. However, there have been two updates that have been issued to non-ESU subscribers:

* In February 2020, Microsoft released an update via Windows Update to fix a black wallpaper issue caused by the January 2020 update for Windows 7.
* In June 2020, Microsoft released an update via Windows Update to roll out the new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge to Windows 7 and 8.1 machines that are not connected to Active Directory. Users, e.g. those on Active Directory, can download Edge from Microsoft&#x27;s website.

In a support document, Microsoft has stated that a full-screen upgrade warning notification would be displayed on Windows 7 PCs on all editions except the Enterprise edition after January 15, 2020. The notification does not appear on machines connected to Active Directory, machines in kiosk mode, or machines subscribed for Extended Security Updates.

=== ESU rollups ===
As part of the September 2022 Extended Security Updates (ESU) rollup, Microsoft quietly added in Secure Boot support, along with partial UEFI support.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Windows 7 received critical acclaim, with critics noting the increased usability and functionality when compared with its predecessor, Windows Vista. &quot;CNET&quot; gave Windows 7 Home Premium a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, stating that it &quot;is more than what Vista should have been, [and] it&#x27;s where Microsoft needed to go&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; rated it a 4 out of 5 saying that Windows 7 is a &quot;big improvement&quot; over Windows Vista, with fewer compatibility problems, a retooled taskbar, simpler home networking and faster start-up. &quot;Maximum PC&quot; gave Windows 7 a rating of 9 out of 10 and called Windows 7 a &quot;massive leap forward&quot; in usability and security, and praised the new Taskbar as &quot;worth the price of admission alone.&quot; &quot;PC World&quot; called Windows 7 a &quot;worthy successor&quot; to Windows XP and said that speed benchmarks showed Windows 7 to be slightly faster than Windows Vista. PC World also named Windows 7 one of the best products of the year.
In its review of Windows 7, Engadget said that Microsoft had taken a &quot;strong step forward&quot; with Windows 7 and reported that speed is one of Windows 7&#x27;s major selling points—particularly for the netbook sets. &quot;Laptop Magazine&quot; gave Windows 7 a rating of 4 out of 5 stars and said that Windows 7 makes computing more intuitive, offered better overall performance including a &quot;modest to dramatic&quot; increase in battery life on laptop computers. &quot;TechRadar&quot; gave Windows 7 a rating of 5 out of 5 stars, concluding that &quot;it combines the security and architectural improvements of Windows Vista with better performance than XP can deliver on today&#x27;s hardware. No version of Windows is ever perfect, but Windows 7 really is the best release of Windows yet.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;The Telegraph&quot; also gave Windows 7 favorable reviews.

Nick Wingfield of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Visually arresting,&quot; and &quot;A pleasure.&quot; Mary Branscombe of &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote, &quot;A clear leap forward.&quot; Jesus Diaz of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; wrote, &quot;Windows 7 Kills Snow Leopard.&quot; Don Reisinger of &quot;CNET&quot; wrote, &quot;Delightful.&quot; David Pogue of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Faster.&quot; J. Peter Bruzzese and Richi Jennings of &quot;Computerworld&quot; wrote, &quot;Ready.&quot;

Some Windows Vista Ultimate users have expressed concerns over Windows 7 pricing and upgrade options. Windows Vista Ultimate users wanting to upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 7 had to either pay $219.99 to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate or perform a clean install, which requires them to reinstall all of their programs.

The changes to User Account Control on Windows 7 were criticized for being potentially insecure, as an exploit was discovered allowing untrusted software to be launched with elevated privileges by exploiting a trusted component. Peter Bright of &quot;Ars Technica&quot; argued that &quot;the way that the Windows 7 UAC &#x27;improvements&#x27; have been made completely exempts Microsoft&#x27;s developers from having to do that work themselves. With Windows 7, it&#x27;s one rule for Redmond, another one for everyone else.&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s Windows kernel engineer Mark Russinovich acknowledged the problem, but noted that malware can also compromise a system when users agree to a prompt.

=== Sales ===
In July 2009, in only eight hours, pre-orders of Windows 7 at amazon.co.uk surpassed the demand which Windows Vista had in its first 17 weeks. It became the highest-grossing pre-order in Amazon&#x27;s history, surpassing sales of the previous record holder, the seventh &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book. After 36 hours, 64-bit versions of Windows 7 Professional and Ultimate editions sold out in Japan. Two weeks after its release its market share had surpassed that of Snow Leopard, released two months previously as the most recent update to Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X operating system. According to Net Applications, Windows 7 reached a 4% market share in less than three weeks; in comparison, it took Windows Vista seven months to reach the same mark. As of February 2014, Windows 7 had a market share of 47.49% according to Net Applications; in comparison, Windows XP had a market share of 29.23%.

On March 4, 2010, Microsoft announced that it had sold more than 90 million licenses.
By April 23, 2010, more than 100 million copies were sold in six months, which made it Microsoft&#x27;s fastest-selling operating system. As of June 23, 2010, Windows 7 has sold 150 million copies which made it the fastest selling operating system in history with seven copies sold every second. Based on worldwide data taken during June 2010 from Windows Update 46% of Windows 7 PCs run the 64-bit edition of Windows 7. According to Stephen Baker of the NPD Group during April 2010 in the United States 77% of PCs sold at retail were pre-installed with the 64-bit edition of Windows 7. As of July 22, 2010, Windows 7 had sold 175 million copies. On October 21, 2010, Microsoft announced that more than 240 million copies of Windows 7 had been sold. Three months later, on January 27, 2011, Microsoft announced total sales of 300 million copies of Windows 7. On July 12, 2011, the sales figure was refined to over 400 million end-user licenses and business installations. As of July 9, 2012, over 630 million licenses have been sold; this number includes licenses sold to OEMs for new PCs.

=== Antitrust concerns ===
As with other Microsoft operating systems, Windows 7 was studied by United States federal regulators who oversee the company&#x27;s operations following the 2001 &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot; settlement. According to status reports filed, the three-member panel began assessing prototypes of the new operating system in February 2008. Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research, said, &quot;[Microsoft&#x27;s] challenge for Windows 7 will be how can they continue to add features that consumers will want that also don&#x27;t run afoul of regulators.&quot;

In order to comply with European antitrust regulations, Microsoft proposed the use of a &quot;ballot&quot; screen containing download links to competing web browsers, thus removing the need for a version of Windows completely without Internet Explorer, as previously planned. Microsoft announced that it would discard the separate version for Europe and ship the standard upgrade and full packages worldwide, in response to criticism involving Windows 7 E and concerns from manufacturers about possible consumer confusion if a version of Windows 7 with Internet Explorer were shipped later, after one without Internet Explorer.

As with the previous version of Windows, an N version, which does not come with Windows Media Player, has been released in Europe, but only for sale directly from Microsoft sales websites and selected others.

<text>Irma Vep is a 1996 French comedy-drama film written and directed by Olivier Assayas. Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung plays a fictionalised version of herself, as disasters result when an unstable French film director (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) attempts to remake Louis Feuillade&#x27;s classic silent film serial &quot;Les Vampires&quot; (1915–16). (&quot;Irma Vep&quot; is an anagram for the word &quot;vampire&quot;.) Taking place largely through the eyes of a foreigner (Cheung), it is also a meditation on the state of the French film industry.

&quot;Irma Vep&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in France on 13 November 1996.

In 2022, the film was reimagined as a miniseries for HBO, created by Assayas.

== Plot ==
The plot mirrors the disorientation felt by director René Vidal during a troubled production of a film-within-a-film. Maggie Cheung has been cast to play the film&#x27;s heroine, Irma Vep, a burglar and a spy, who dresses in a tight, black, latex rubber catsuit. Irma Vep, it is explained, is an anagram for &quot;vampire&quot;, but she is not a literal vampire. Rather, she is the inspiration for a criminal gang named The Vampires, as in Feuillade&#x27;s original serial.

René, the cast and crew view the film&#x27;s dailies and he angrily declares the footage terrible and soulless. After he storms out, everyone else quickly departs the facility, leaving Maggie stranded. She accepts an invitation from the costume designer, Zoé, to a group dinner with other crew members. There, Zoé confides to another woman that she is romantically interested in Maggie, which the woman then tells Maggie, embarrassing her.

After the dinner with the other crew members, Maggie visits René at a hotel in the aftermath of a violent episode with his wife. René admits that he had mainly wanted to make the film because he desired to see her in it. Later that evening, Maggie, apparently possessed by her character, dons the catsuit and steals jewelry from a hotel suite while a nude woman argues on the phone with her boyfriend. She then throws away the jewelry.

The next morning, Zoé picks an exhausted Maggie up from her hotel room. René is a no-show on the set, and the crew attempt to film without him. At the end of the day, imperious film director José Mirano meets Maggie&#x27;s costar Laure at a bar and tells her René has had a breakdown and that he has been hired to complete the film. He firmly contends that a Chinese actress should not be playing Irma Vep, who he sees as an icon within French culture. José tells her he intends to replace Maggie with Laure.

Zoé and Maggie take a taxi to a rave, but Maggie declines to go at the last minute and departs in the taxi. Zoé, looking disappointed, walks through the crowd at the rave.

José and the cast and crew gather at the screening facility to view the rushes that René has personally edited. Maggie is not there, however, and it is said that she has left for America to work on a film with Ridley Scott. The film ends with the rushes, which have been cut into a hallucinatory montage with numerous scratches and other modifications being done to the film itself. The future of the production is not revealed.

==Cast==
==Allusions to French film history==
The film refers to iconic figures in French film history: Louis Feuillade, Musidora, Arletty, François Truffaut, the Groupe SLON, Alain Delon, and Catherine Deneuve. Thematically, the film questions the place of French cinema at the time. According to Chris Darke, it is not a &quot;mourning for cinema with the romantic nostalgia&quot; but &quot;more like the Mexican Day of the Dead: remembrance as an act of celebration&quot;. Furthermore, Dale Hudson of &quot;Screen&quot; wrote, &quot;It is less a film about re-presenting the past, than it is a film about addressing the present, specifically the place of France within the global economy.&quot;

== Production ==
The idea for the film was born out of an attempted collaboration among Assayas, Claire Denis, and Atom Egoyan, who wanted to experiment with the situation of a foreigner in Paris. In the 1915 original serial, written and directed by Louis Feuillade, Irma Vep was played by French silent film actress Musidora (1889–1957). Much of the film depicts set-related incidents that echo scenes in Truffaut&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;Day for Night&quot;, to which &quot;Irma Vep&quot; owes a large thematic debt.

However, Assayas publicly stated that although he considers &quot;La nuit americaine&quot; a great film, it is more about the fantasy of filmmaking than the reality. Assayas credits as a greater inspiration Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;Beware of a Holy Whore&quot;, in which Lou Castel, who plays the replacement director José Mirano in this film, plays a film director.

Assayas wrote the script in ten weeks, and the film was shot in a month, with no retakes. &quot;Its hasty production circumstances seem perilously close to the ones that cause everyone such grief in the film.&quot;

Assayas married Cheung in 1998. They divorced in 2001. They again collaborated in 2004 on the film &quot;Clean&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Irma Vep&quot; received a positive critical response. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 94% based on 47 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Starring a bewitching Maggie Cheung, &quot;Irma Vep&quot; is an evocative and reflexive satire of the filmmaking process that is bursting at the seams with an affection for cinema.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 80 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==References in other media==
Lettrist footage from the film, along with shots from the original &quot;Les Vampires&quot;, are used in White Ring&#x27;s video for their single &quot;IxC999&quot;.

A character in the five-comic series &quot;Anno Dracula – 1895: Seven Days in Mayhem&quot; by Kim Newman and Paul McCaffrey is based on Irma Vep.

==Home media==
&quot;Irma Vep&quot; was released on Blu-ray and DVD through The Criterion Collection on 27 April 2021.

==Television adaptation==
HBO produced a limited television series adaptation of the film that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 22 May 2022, and was released on 6 June 2022 on HBO. It stars Alicia Vikander, Vincent Macaigne, Adria Arjona, Byron Bowers, Devon Ross, Carrie Brownstein, Tom Sturridge and Fala Chen and was written and directed by Assayas.

<doc id="326125" wikidata="Q310197" url="?curid=326125" title="Lazar of Serbia">
<text>Lazar Hrebeljanović (; – 15 June 1389) was a medieval Serbian ruler who created the largest and most powerful state on the territory of the disintegrated Serbian Empire. Lazar&#x27;s state, referred to by historians as Moravian Serbia, comprised the basins of the Great Morava, West Morava, and South Morava rivers. Lazar ruled Moravian Serbia from 1371 until his death in 1389. He sought to resurrect the Serbian Empire and place himself at its helm, claiming to be the direct successor of the Nemanjić dynasty, which went extinct in 1371 after ruling over Serbia for two centuries. Lazar&#x27;s programme had the full support of the Serbian Orthodox Church, but the Serbian nobility did not recognize him as their supreme ruler. He is often referred to as Tsar Lazar Hrebeljanović ( / &quot;Car Lazar Hrebeljanović&quot;); however, he only held the title of prince ( / &quot;knez&quot;).

Lazar was killed at the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389 while leading a Christian army assembled to confront the invading Ottoman Empire, led by Sultan Murad I. The battle ended without a clear victor, with both sides enduring heavy losses. Lazar&#x27;s widow, Milica, who ruled as regent for their adolescent son Stefan Lazarević, Lazar&#x27;s successor, accepted Ottoman suzerainty in the summer of 1390.

Lazar is venerated in the Orthodox Christian Church as a martyr and saint, and is highly regarded in Serbian history, culture and tradition. In Serbian epic poetry, he is referred to as Tsar Lazar ( / &quot;Car Lazar&quot;).

==Life==

Lazar was born around 1329 in the Fortress of Prilepac, southeast of Novo Brdo, then an important mining town. His family were the hereditary lords of Prilepac, which together with the nearby Fortress of Prizrenac protected the mines and settlements around Novo Brdo. Lazar&#x27;s father, Pribac, was a logothete (chancellor) in the court of Stefan Dušan, a member of the Nemanjić dynasty, who ruled as the King of Serbia from 1331 to 1346 and the Serbian Emperor (tsar) from 1346 to 1355. The rank of logothete was relatively modest in the hierarchy of the Serbian court. Dušan became the ruler of Serbia by dethroning his father, King Stefan Uroš III, then rewarding the petty nobles that had supported him in his rebellion, elevating them to higher positions within the feudal hierarchy. Lazar&#x27;s father was among these nobles and was elevated to the position of logothete by pledging loyalty to Dušan. According to Mavro Orbin, a 16th-century Ragusan historian, Pribac and Lazar&#x27;s surname was Hrebeljanović. Though Orbin did not provide a source for this claim, it has been widely accepted in historiography.

===Courtier===
Pribac was awarded by Dušan in yet another way: his son Lazar was granted the position of &quot;stavilac&quot; at the ruler&#x27;s court. The &quot;stavilac&quot; (literally &quot;placer&quot;) had a role in the ceremony at the royal table, though he could be entrusted with jobs that had nothing to do with court ritual. The title of &quot;stavilac&quot; ranked as the last in the hierarchy of the Serbian court. It was, nevertheless, quite prestigious as it enabled its holder to be very close to the ruler. Around 1353 &quot;Stavilac&quot; Lazar Hrebeljanović married Princess Milica Nemanjić. According to subsequent genealogies, created in the first half of the 15th century, Milica was the daughter of Prince Vratko, a great-grandson of Vukan, Grand Prince of Serbia (1202-1204). The latter was the son of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja, the founder of the Nemanjić dynasty, which ruled Serbia from 1166 to 1371. Vukan&#x27;s descendants are not mentioned in any known source that predates the 15th-century genealogies.

Tsar Dušan died suddenly in 1355 at the age of about 47, and was succeeded by his 20-year-old son Stefan Uroš V. Lazar remained a &quot;stavilac&quot; at the court of the new tsar. Dušan&#x27;s death was followed by the stirring of separatist activity in the Serbian Empire. Epirus and Thessaly in its southwest broke away by 1359. The same happened with Braničevo and Kučevo, the empire&#x27;s north-eastern regions controlled by the Rastislalić family, who recognized the suzerainty of King Louis of Hungary. The rest of the Serbian state remained loyal to young Tsar Uroš. Even within it, however, powerful Serbian nobles were asserting more and more independence from the tsar&#x27;s authority.

Uroš was weak and unable to counteract these separatist tendencies, becoming an inferior power in the state he nominally ruled. He relied on the strongest Serbian noble, Prince Vojislav Vojinović of Zahumlje. Vojislav started as a &quot;stavilac&quot; at the court of Tsar Dušan, but by 1363 he controlled a large region from Mount Rudnik in central Serbia to Konavle on the Adriatic coast, and from the upper reaches of the Drina River to northern Kosovo. The next in power to Prince Vojislav were the Balšić brothers, Stracimir, Đurađ, and Balša II. By 1363, they gained control over the region of Zeta, which coincided for the most part with present-day Montenegro.

In 1361, Prince Vojislav started a war with the Republic of Ragusa over some territories. Ragusans then asked most eminent persons in Serbia to use their influence to stop these hostilities that were harmful for both sides. In 1362 the Ragusans also applied to &quot;stavilac&quot; Lazar and presented him with three bolts of cloth. A relatively modest present as it was, it testifies that Lazar was perceived as having some influence at the court of Tsar Uroš. The peace between Prince Vojislav and Ragusa was signed in August 1362. &quot;Stavilac&quot; Lazar is mentioned as a witness in a July 1363 document by which Tsar Uroš approved an exchange of lands between Prince Vojislav and &quot;čelnik&quot; Musa. The latter man had been married to Lazar&#x27;s sister, Dragana, since at least 1355. Musa&#x27;s title, &quot;čelnik&quot; (&quot;headman&quot;), was of a higher rank than &quot;stavilac&quot;.

===Minor regional lord===
Lazar&#x27;s activities in the period between 1363 and 1371 are poorly documented in sources. Apparently, he left the court of Tsar Uroš in 1363 or 1365; he was about 35 years of age, and had not advanced beyond the rank of &quot;stavilac&quot;. Prince Vojislav, the strongest regional lord, suddenly died in September 1363. The Mrnjavčević brothers, Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa, became the most powerful nobles in the Serbian Empire. They controlled lands in the south of the Empire, primarily in Macedonia. In 1365, Tsar Uroš crowned Vukašin king, making him his co-ruler. Approximately at the same time, Jovan Uglješa was promoted to the rank of despot. A nephew of Prince Vojislav, Nikola Altomanović, gained control by 1368 of most of the territory of his late uncle; Nikola was about 20 at that time. In this period, Lazar became independent and began his career as a regional lord. It is not clear how his territory developed, but its nucleus was certainly not at his patrimony, the Fortress of Prilepac, which had been taken by Vukašin. The nucleus of Lazar&#x27;s territory was somewhere in the area bordered by the Mrnjavčevićs in the south, Nikola Altomanović in the west, and the Rastislalićs in the north.

The book &quot;Il Regno de gli Slavi [The Realm of the Slavs]&quot; by Mavro Orbin, published in Pesaro in 1601, describes events in which Lazar was a main protagonist. Since this account is not corroborated by other sources, some historians doubt its veracity. According to Orbin, Nikola Altomanović and Lazar persuaded Tsar Uroš to join them in their attack on the Mrnjavčević brothers. The clash between the two groups of Serbian lords took place on the Kosovo Field in 1369. Lazar withdrew from the battle soon after it began. His allies fought on, but were defeated by the Mrnjavčevićs. Altomanović barely escaped with his life, while Uroš was captured and briefly imprisoned by the brothers. There are indications that the co-rulers, Tsar Uroš and King Vukašin Mrnjavčević, went their separate ways two years prior to the alleged battle. In 1370 Lazar took from Altomanović the town of Rudnik, a rich mining centre. This could have been a consequence of Altomanović&#x27;s defeat the year before. In any case, Altomanović could have quickly recovered from this defeat with the help of his powerful protector, the Kingdom of Hungary.

It is uncertain since when Lazar had borne the title of &quot;knez&quot;, which is usually translated as &quot;prince&quot;. The earliest source that testifies to Lazar&#x27;s new title is a Ragusan document in Latin, dated 22 April 1371, in which he is referred to as &quot;Comes Lazarus&quot;. Ragusans used &quot;comes&quot; as a Latin translation of the Slavic title &quot;knez&quot;. The same document relates that Lazar held Rudnik at that time. In medieval Serbia, &quot;knez&quot; was not a precisely defined term, and the title had no fixed rank in the feudal hierarchy. Its rank was high in the 12th century, but somewhat lower in the 13th century and the first half of the 14th century. During the reign of Tsar Uroš, when the central authority declined, the high prestige of the title of &quot;knez&quot; was restored. It was borne by the mightiest regional lord, Vojislav Vojinović, until his death in 1363.

====Rise to power====
The Ottoman Turks took Gallipoli from Byzantium in 1354. This town at the south-eastern edge of the Balkan Peninsula was the first Ottoman possession in Europe. From there the Ottomans expanded further into the Balkans, and by 1370 they reached Serbian lands, specifically the territory of the Mrnjavčevićs in eastern Macedonia. An army of the Mrnjavčević brothers entered the territory controlled by the Ottomans and clashed with them in the Battle of Marica on 26 September 1371. The Ottomans annihilated the Serbian army; both King Vukašin and Despot Jovan Uglješa were killed in the battle. Vukašin&#x27;s son and successor, King Marko, became the co-ruler of Tsar Uroš. In December 1371 Uroš died childless, marking the end of the Nemanjić dynasty, which had ruled Serbia for two centuries. The ruler of the Serbian state, which had in fact ceased to exist as a whole, was formally King Marko Mrnjavčević. Powerful Serbian lords, however, did not even consider recognizing him as their supreme ruler. They attacked the Mrnjavčevićs&#x27; lands in Macedonia and Kosovo. Prizren and Peć were taken by the Balšić brothers, the lords of Zeta. Prince Lazar took Priština and Novo Brdo, recovering also his patrimony, the Fortress of Prilepac. The Dragaš brothers, Jovan and Konstantin, created their own domain in eastern Macedonia. King Marko was eventually left only a relatively small area in western Macedonia centred on the town of Prilep. Jovan Uglješa&#x27;s widow, Jelena, who became a nun and took the monastic name of Jefimija, lived on with Prince Lazar and his wife Milica.

After the demise of the Mrnjavčević brothers, Nikola Altomanović emerged as the most powerful noble on the territory of the fragmented Serbian state. While Lazar was busy taking Priština and Novo Brdo, Nikola recovered Rudnik from him. By 1372, Prince Lazar and Tvrtko, the Ban of Bosnia, formed an alliance against Nikola. According to Ragusan sources, the Republic of Venice mediated an agreement between Nikola Altomanović and Djuradj Balšić about their joint attack on Ragusa. Nikola was to gain Pelješac and Ston, the Ragusan parts of the region of Zahumlje, which was divided between Nikola&#x27;s domain, Bosnia, and Ragusa. Louis I, the King of Hungary, sternly warned Nikola and Djuradj to keep off Ragusa, which had been a Hungarian vassal since 1358. By conspiring with Venice, a Hungarian enemy, Nikola lost the protection of Hungary. Lazar, preparing for the confrontation with Nikola, promised King Louis to be his loyal vassal if the king was on his side. Prince Lazar and Ban Tvrtko attacked and defeated Nikola Altomanović in 1373. Nikola was captured in his stronghold, the town of Užice, and given in charge to Lazar&#x27;s nephews, the Musić brothers, who (according to Orbin with the secret approval of Lazar) blinded him. Lazar accepted the suzerainty of King Louis.
Ban Tvrtko annexed to his state the parts of Zahumlje which were held by Nikola, including the upper reaches of the Drina and Lim Rivers, as well as the districts of Onogošt and Gacko. Prince Lazar and his in-laws, Vuk Branković and &quot;čelnik&quot; Musa, took most of Nikola&#x27;s domain. Vuk Branković, who married Lazar&#x27;s daughter Mara in around 1371, acquired Sjenica and part of Kosovo. Lazar&#x27;s subordinate, &quot;čelnik&quot; Musa, governed an area around Mount Kopaonik jointly with his sons Stefan and Lazar, known as the Musić brothers. Djuradj Balšić grabbed Nikola&#x27;s littoral districts: Dračevica, Konavle, and Trebinje. Ban Tvrtko would take these lands in 1377. In October of that year, Tvrtko was crowned king of the Serbs, Bosnia, Maritime, and Western Areas. Although Tvrtko was a Catholic, his coronation was performed at the Serbian Monastery of Mileševa, or at some other prominent Serbian Orthodox centre in his state. King Tvrtko asserted pretensions to the Serbian throne and the heritage of the Nemanjić dynasty. He was a distant blood relative to the Nemanjićs. Hungary and Ragusa recognized Tvrtko as king, and there are no indications that Prince Lazar had any objections to the new title of his ally Kotromanić. This, on the other hand, does not mean that Lazar recognized Tvrtko as his overlord. King Tvrtko, however, had no support from the Serbian Church, the only cohesive force in the fragmented Serbian state.

====Major lord in Serbia====

After the demise of Nikola Altomanović, Prince Lazar emerged as the most powerful lord on the territory of the former Serbian Empire. Some local nobles resisted Lazar&#x27;s authority, but they eventually submitted to the prince. That was the case with Nikola Zojić on Mount Rudnik, and Novak Belocrkvić in the valley of the Toplica River. Lazar&#x27;s large and rich domain was a refuge for Eastern Orthodox Christian monks who fled from areas threatened by the Islamic Ottomans. This brought fame to Lazar on Mount Athos, the centre of Orthodox monasticism. The Serbian Church (Serbian Patriarchate of Peć) had since 1350 been in schism with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the central authority of the Eastern Orthodox Christianity. A Serb monk from Mount Athos named Isaija, who distinguished himself as a writer and translator, encouraged Lazar to work on the reconciliation of the two patriarchates. Through efforts of Lazar and Isaija, an ecclesiastical delegation was sent to the Constantinopolitan Patriarch to negotiate the reconciliation. The delegation was successful, and in 1375 the Serbian Church was readmitted into communion with the Patriarchate of Constantinople.

The last patriarch of the Serbian Church in schism, Sava IV, died in April 1375. In October of the same year, Prince Lazar and Djuradj Balšić convened a synod of the Serbian Church in Peć. Patriarch Jefrem was selected for the new head of the Church. He was a candidate of Constantinople, or a compromise selection from among the candidates of powerful nobles. Patriarch Jefrem abdicated in 1379 in favour of Spiridon, which is explained by some historians as having resulted from the influence of an undercurrent in the Church associated with Lazar. The prince and Patriarch Spiridon had an excellent cooperation. The Church was obliged to Lazar for his role in ending the schism with Constantinople. Lazar also granted lands to monasteries and built churches. His greatest legacy as a church builder is the Monastery of Ravanica completed in 1381. Some time earlier, he built the Church of St Stephen in his capital, Kruševac; the church would become known as Lazarica. After 1379, he built the Gornjak Monastery in Braničevo. He was one of the founders of the Romanian monasteries in Tismana and Vodiţa. He funded some construction works in two monasteries on Mount Athos, the Serbian Hilandar and the Russian St Panteleimon.

Lazar extended his domain to the Danube in 1379, when the prince took Kučevo and Braničevo, ousting the Hungarian vassal Radič Branković Rastislalić from these regions. King Louis had earlier granted to Lazar the region of Mačva, or at least a part of it, probably when the prince accepted the king&#x27;s suzerainty. This suggests that Lazar, who was himself a vassal of Louis, had rebelled, and indeed Louis is known to have been organizing a campaign against Serbia in 1378. However, it is not known against whom Louis was intending to act. It is also possible that it was Radič Branković Rastislalić and that Lazar&#x27;s attack had the approval of Louis.

Lazar&#x27;s state, known in literature as Moravian Serbia, was larger than the domains of the other lords on the territory of the former Serbian Empire. It also had a better organized government and army. The state comprised the basins of the Great Morava, West Morava, and South Morava Rivers, extending from the source of South Morava northward to the Danube and Sava Rivers. Its north-western border ran along the Drina River. Besides the capital Kruševac, the state included important towns of Niš and Užice, as well as Novo Brdo and Rudnik, the two richest mining centres of medieval Serbia. Of all the Serbian lands, Lazar&#x27;s state lay furthest from Ottoman centres, and was least exposed to the ravages of Turkish raiding parties. This circumstance attracted immigrants from Turkish-threatened areas, who built new villages and hamlets in previously poorly inhabited and uncultivated areas of Moravian Serbia. There were also spiritual persons among the immigrants, which stimulated the revival of old ecclesiastical centres and the foundation of new ones in Lazar&#x27;s state. The strategic position of the Morava basins contributed to Lazar&#x27;s prestige and political influence in the Balkans due to the anticipated Turkish offensives.
In charters issued between 1379 and 1388, the prince named himself as Stefan Lazar. &quot;Stefan&quot; was the name borne by all Nemanjić rulers, leading the name to be regarded as a title of Serbian rulers. Tvrtko added &quot;Stefan&quot; to his name when he was crowned king of the Serbs and Bosnia. From a linguistic point of view, Lazar&#x27;s charters show traits of the Kosovo-Resava dialect of the Serbian language. In the charters, Lazar referred to himself as the autocrator (&quot;samodržac&quot; in Serbian) of all the Serbian land, or the autocrator of all the Serbs. Autocrator, &quot;self-ruler&quot; in Greek, was an epithet of the Byzantine emperors. The Nemanjić kings adopted it and applied it to themselves in its literal meaning to stress their independence from Byzantium, whose supreme suzerainty they nominally recognized. In the time of Prince Lazar, the Serbian state experienced the loss of some of its lands, the division of the remaining lands among regional lords, the end of the Nemanjić dynasty, and the Turkish attacks. These circumstances raised the question of a continuation of the Serbian state. Lazar&#x27;s answer to this question could be read in the titles he applied to himself in his charters. Lazar&#x27;s ideal was the reunification of the Serbian state under him as the direct successor of the Nemanjićs. Lazar had the full support of the Serbian Church for this political programme. However, powerful regional lords—the Balšićs in Zeta, Vuk Branković in Kosovo, King Marko, Konstantin Dragaš, and Radoslav Hlapen in Macedonia—ruled their domains independent from Prince Lazar. Beside that, the three lords in Macedonia became Ottoman vassals after the Battle of Marica. The same happened to Byzantium and Bulgaria. By 1388, Ottoman suzerainty was also accepted by Djuradj Stracimirović Balšić, the lord of Zeta.

A Turkish raiding party, passing unobstructed through territories of Ottoman vassals, broke into Moravian Serbia in 1381. It was routed by Lazar&#x27;s nobles Crep Vukoslavić and Vitomir in the Battle of Dubravnica, fought near the town of Paraćin. In 1386, the Ottoman Sultan Murad I himself led much larger forces that took Niš from Lazar. It is unclear whether the encounter between the armies of Lazar and Murad at Pločnik, a site southwest of Niš, happened shortly before or after the capture of Niš. Lazar rebuffed Murad at Pločnik. After the death of King Louis I in 1382, a civil war broke out in the Kingdom of Hungary. It seems that Lazar participated in the war as one of the opponents of Prince Sigismund of Luxemburg. Lazar may have sent some troops to fight in the regions of Belgrade and Syrmia. As the Ottoman threat increased and the support for Sigismund grew in Hungary, Lazar made peace with Sigismund, who was crowned Hungarian king in March 1387. The peace was sealed, probably in 1387, with the marriage of Lazar&#x27;s daughter Teodora to Nicholas II Garay, a powerful Hungarian noble who supported Sigismund. Around the same year, Lazar&#x27;s daughter Jelena married Djuradj Stracimirović Balšić. About a year before, Lazar&#x27;s daughter Dragana married Alexander, the son of Ivan Shishman, Tsar of Bulgaria.

====Battle of Kosovo====

Since the encounter at Pločnik in 1386, it was clear to Lazar that a decisive battle with the Ottomans was imminent. After he made peace with Sigismund, to avoid troubles on his northern borders, the prince secured military support from Vuk Branković and King Tvrtko. The King of the Serbs and Bosnia was also expecting a bigger Ottoman offensive since his army, commanded by Vlatko Vuković, wiped out a large Turkish raiding party in the Battle of Bileća in 1388. A massive Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad, estimated at between 27,000 and 30,000 men, advanced across the territory of Konstantin Dragaš and arrived in June 1389 on the Kosovo Field near Priština, on the territory of Vuk Branković. The Ottoman army was met by the forces commanded by Prince Lazar, estimated at between 12,000 and 30,000 men, which consisted of the prince&#x27;s own troops, Vuk Branković&#x27;s troops, and a contingent under the leadership of Vlatko Vuković sent by King Tvrtko. The Battle of Kosovo, the most famous battle in Serbia&#x27;s medieval history, was fought on 15 June 1389. In the fierce fighting and mutual heavy losses, both Prince Lazar and Sultan Murad lost their lives. Lazar is killed during battle, Sultan Murad was assassinated after the battle by Serbian nobleman later identified as Miloš Obilić(or Kobilić), pretended to have deserted to the Ottoman forces. When brought before Murad, Obilić pulled out a hidden dagger and killed the Sultan by slashing him. He was then killed by the Sultan&#x27;s bodyguards.

Information about the course and the outcome of the Battle of Kosovo is incomplete in the historical sources. It can be concluded that, tactically, the battle was a draw. However, the mutual heavy losses were devastating only for the Serbs, who had brought to Kosovo almost all of their fighting strength. Although Serbia under Prince Lazar was an economically prosperous and militarily well organized state, it could not compare to the Ottoman Empire with respect to the size of territory, population, and economic power. Lazar was succeeded by his eldest son Stefan Lazarević. As he was still a minor, Moravian Serbia was administered by Stefan&#x27;s mother, Milica. She was attacked from the north five months after the battle by troops of the Hungarian King Sigismund. When Turkish forces, moving toward Hungary, reached the borders of Moravian Serbia in the summer of 1390, Milica accepted Ottoman suzerainty. She sent her youngest daughter, Olivera, to join the harem of Sultan Bayezid I. Vuk Branković became an Ottoman vassal in 1392. Now all the Serbian lands were under Ottoman suzerainty, except Zahumlje under King Tvrtko.

==Cult==

===Under Serbian rulers===
After the Battle of Kosovo, Prince Lazar was interred in the Church of the Ascension in Priština, the capital of Vuk Branković&#x27;s domain. After a year or two, in 1390 or 1391, Lazar&#x27;s relics were transferred to the Ravanica Monastery, which the prince had built and intended as his burial place. The translation was organized by the Serbian Church and Lazar&#x27;s family. The ceremonial interment of the relics in Ravanica was attended by the highest clergy of the Serbian Church, including Patriarch Danilo III. It is most likely at this time and place that Lazar was canonized, though no account of his canonization was written. He was included among the Christian martyrs, with his feast day being celebrated on 15 June. According to writings by Patriarch Danilo and other contemporary authors, Prince Lazar was captured and beheaded by the Turks. His death could thus be likened to that of early Christian martyrs who were slain by pagans.
In a medieval state with a strong link between the State and the Church, as in Moravian Serbia, a canonization was not only an ecclesiastical act. It also had a social significance. After two centuries of rule of the Nemanjić dynasty, most members of which were canonized, Lazar was the first lay person to be recognized as a saint. During his lifetime, he had achieved considerable prestige as the major lord on the territory of the former Serbian Empire. The Church saw him as the only ruler worthy and capable of succeeding the Nemanjićs and restoring their state. His death was seen as a turning point in Serbian history. The aftermath of the Battle of Kosovo was felt in Serbia almost immediately, although more significant in the long run was the Battle of Marica eighteen years earlier, as the defeat of the Mrnjavčević brothers in it opened up the Balkans to the Turks.

Lazar is celebrated as a saint and martyr in ten cultic writings composed in Serbia between 1389 and 1420; nine of them could be dated closer to the former year than to the latter. These writings were the principal means of spreading the cult of Saint Lazar, and most of them were used in liturgy on his feast day. The &quot;Encomium of Prince Lazar&quot; by nun Jefimija is considered to have the highest literary quality of the ten texts. Nun Jefimija (whose secular name was Jelena) was a relative of Princess Milica, and the widow of Jovan Uglješa Mrnjavčević. After his death she lived on with Milica and Lazar. Jefimija embroidered her &quot;Encomium&quot; with a gilded thread on the silken shroud covering Lazar&#x27;s relics. Stefan Lazarević is regarded as the author of the text carved on a marble pillar that was erected at the site of the Battle of Kosovo. The pillar was destroyed by the Ottomans, but the text is preserved in a 16th-century manuscript. Patriarch Danilo III wrote &quot;Narration about Prince Lazar&quot; around the time of the translation of Lazar&#x27;s relics. It is regarded as historically the most informative of the ten writings, though it is a synthesis of hagiography, eulogy, and homily. The prince is celebrated not only as a martyr, but also as a warrior. The patriarch wrote that the Battle of Kosovo ended when both sides became exhausted; both the Serbs and the Turks suffered heavy losses. The central part of &quot;Narration&quot; is the patriarch&#x27;s version of Lazar&#x27;s speech to Serbian warriors before the battle:


With Lazar&#x27;s death, Serbia lost its strongest regional ruler, who might have been seen as the last hope against the expanding Ottomans. This loss could have led to pessimism and a feeling of despair. The authors of the cultic writings interpreted the death of Lazar and the thousands of his warriors on the Kosovo Field as a martyrdom for the Christian faith and for Serbia. Sultan Murad and his army are described as bloodthirsty, godless, heathen beasts. Prince Lazar, by his martyrdom, remains eternally among the Serbs as the good shepherd. His cult was adjoined to the other great cults of medieval Serbia, those of the first canonized Nemanjićs—Saint Simeon (whose secular name was Nemanja) and his son Saint Sava. The cults contributed to the consolidation of the Serbs in a strong religious and political unit. Lazar was, however, in the shadow of Saint Sava and Saint Simeon.

Lazar&#x27;s son and successor, Stefan Lazarević, was granted the title of despot by the Byzantine Emperor, and he ceased to be an Ottoman vassal in 1402. At least during his reign, the Holy Prince Lazar was probably venerated throughout Moravian Serbia, as well as in two monasteries on Mount Athos, the Serbian Hilandar and the Russian St. Panteleimon, in which the prince had funded some construction works. During Despot Stefan&#x27;s reign, only one image of Lazar is known to have been painted. It is in a fresco in the Ljubostinja Monastery, built around 1405 by Princess Milica. Lazar is represented there with regal attributes, rather than saintly ones. His next image would not appear until 1594, when it was painted among images of numerous other personages in the Orahovica Monastery in Slavonia (then under Ottoman rule). For his cult, more important than iconography was the cultic literature.

Despot Stefan Lazarević suddenly died in July 1427. He was succeeded by Despot Đurađ, Vuk Branković&#x27;s son and Lazar&#x27;s grandson. At the beginning of his reign, Đurađ issued a charter in which he referred to Lazar as a saint. When he reissued the charter in 1445, he avoided the adjective свети &quot;saint&quot;, in reference to Lazar, by replacing it with светопочивши &quot;resting in holiness&quot;. The avoidance to refer to the prince as a saint can be observed in other documents and inscriptions of that period, including those authored by his daughter Jelena.

===During Ottoman rule===
The Serbian Despotate fell to the Ottomans in 1459. The veneration of the Holy Prince Lazar was reduced to a local cult, centred on the Ravanica Monastery. Its monks continued to celebrate annually his feast day. The prince had granted 148 villages and various privileges to the monastery. The Ottomans reduced its property to a couple of villages containing 127 households in all, but they exempted Ravanica from some taxes. Italian traveller Marc Antonio Pigafetta, who visited Ravanica in 1568, reported that the monastery was never damaged by the Turks, and the monks practiced freely their religion, except that they were not allowed to ring bells.

Saint Lazar was venerated at the court of Ivan the Terrible, the first Russian tsar (1547–1584), whose maternal grandmother was born in the Serbian noble family of Jakšić. Lazar appears in a fresco in the Cathedral of the Archangel, the burial place of Russian rulers in the Moscow Kremlin. The walls of the cathedral were painted in 1565 with frescoes showing all Russian rulers preceding Ivan the Terrible. Only four non-Russians were depicted: Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and three Serbs—Saints Simeon, Sava, and Lazar. The prince is also represented in the Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible, in its nine miniatures depicting the Battle of Kosovo. It is in this Russian book that Prince Lazar was for the first time referred to as a tsar. Around 1700, Count Đorđe Branković would write his &quot;Slavo-Serbian Chronicles&quot;, in which he claimed that Lazar was crowned tsar. This would influence Serbian folk tradition, in which the prince is to this day known as Tsar Lazar. After the death of Ivan the Terrible, Lazar is rarely mentioned in Russian sources.

Lazar&#x27;s cult in his Ottoman-held homeland, reduced to the Ravanica Monastery, was given a boost during the office of Serbian Patriarch Paisije. In 1633 and several ensuing years, Lazar was painted in the church of the Patriarchal Monastery of Peć and three other Serbian churches. Patriarch Paisije wrote that Serbian Tsar Dušan adopted Lazar and gave him his relative, Princess Milica, in marriage. In this way, Lazar was the legitimate successor to the Nemanjić dynasty. In 1667, the prince was painted on a wall in the Hilandar Monastery. The same painter created an icon showing Lazar together with Đorđe Kratovac, a goldsmith who was tortured and killed by the Turks and recognized as a martyr. In 1675, Prince Lazar and several Nemanjićs were represented in an icon commissioned by the brothers Gavro and Vukoje Humković, Serbian craftsmen from Sarajevo. The prince&#x27;s images from this period show him more as a ruler than as a saint, except the icon with Đorđe Kratovac.

===After the Great Serb Migration===

During the Great Turkish War in the last decades of the 17th century, the Habsburg monarchy took some Serbian lands from the Ottomans. In 1690, a considerable proportion of the Serbian population living in these lands emigrated to the Habsburg Monarchy, as its army retreated from Serbia before the advancing Ottomans. This exodus, known as the Great Serb Migration, was led by Arsenije III Čarnojević, the patriarch of the Serbian Church. The Ravanica monks joined the northward exodus, taking Lazar&#x27;s relics and the monastery&#x27;s valuables with them. They settled at the town of Szentendre, near which they built a wooden church and placed the relics in it. They built houses for themselves around the church, and named their new settlement Ravanica. Szentendre also became a temporary see of Patriarch Arsenije III.

The Ravanica monks established contacts with Serbian monasteries in the Habsburg Monarchy, and with the Russian Orthodox Church, from which they received help. They considerably enlarged their library and treasury during their stay at Szentendre. In this period they started to use printing to spread the veneration of the Holy Prince: they made a woodcut representing Lazar as a cephalophore, holding his severed head in his hand. In 1697, the Ravanica monks left their wooden settlement at Szentendre and moved to the dilapidated Monastery of Vrdnik-Ravanica on Mount Fruška Gora in the region of Syrmia. They renovated it and placed Lazar&#x27;s relics in its church, after which this monastery became the centre of Lazar&#x27;s cult. It soon came to be more frequently referred to as Ravanica than Vrdnik. By the mid-18th century, a general belief arose that the monastery was founded by Prince Lazar himself. Its church became too small to accommodate all the devotees who assembled there on holidays.
The Treaty of Passarowitz, by which Serbia north of the West Morava was ceded from the Ottoman Empire to the Habsburg Monarchy, was signed on 21 July 1718. At that time, only one of the original Ravanica monks who had left their monastery 28 years ago, was still alive. His name was Stefan. Shortly before the treaty was signed, Stefan returned to Ravanica and renovated the monastery, which had been half-ruined and overgrown with vegetation when he came. In 1733, there were only five monks in Ravanica. Serbia was returned to the Ottoman Empire in 1739, but the monastery was not completely abandoned this time.

After the Great Serb Migration, the highest clergy of the Serbian Church actively popularized the cults of canonized Serbian rulers. Arsenije IV Šakabenta, Metropolitan of Karlovci, employed in 1741 the engravers Hristofor Žefarović and Toma Mesmer to create a poster titled &quot;Saint Sava with Serbian Saints of the House of Nemanja&quot;, where Lazar was also depicted. Its purpose was not only religious, as it should also remind people of the independent Serbian state before the Ottoman conquest, and of Prince Lazar&#x27;s fight against the Ottomans. The poster was presented at the Habsburg court. The same engravers produced a book titled &quot;Stemmatographia&quot;, published in Vienna in 1741. Part of it included copperplates of 29 rulers and saints, among whom were two cephalophores, Jovan Vladimir and Lazar. &quot;Stemmatographia&quot; was very popular among the Serbs, stirring patriotic feelings in them. The Holy Prince would often be represented as a cephalophore in subsequent works, created in various artistic techniques. An isolated case among the images of Lazar is a 1773 copperplate by Zaharije Orfelin, in which the prince has a parading appearance, without saintly attributes except a halo.

Lazar&#x27;s relics remained in the Monastery of Vrdnik-Ravanica until 1941. Shortly before Nazi Germany attacked and overran Yugoslavia, the relics were taken to the Bešenovo Monastery, also on Mount Fruška Gora. Syrmia became part of the Nazi puppet state of Croatia, controlled by the fascist Ustaše movement, which conducted large-scale genocide campaigns against the Serbs. The Archimandrite of Vrdnik, Longin, who escaped to Belgrade in 1941, reported that Serbian sacred objects on Fruška Gora were in danger of total destruction. He proposed that they be taken to Belgrade, which was accepted by the Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church. On 14 April 1942, after the German occupation authorities gave their permission, the reliquary with Lazar&#x27;s relics was transported from Bešenovo to the Belgrade Cathedral Church and ceremonially laid in front of the iconostasis in the church. In 1954, the Synod decided that the relics should be returned to the Ravanica Monastery, which was accomplished in 1989—on the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo.

==Tradition==

In Serbian epic tradition, Lazar is said to have been visited the night before battle by a grey hawk or falcon from Jerusalem who offered a choice between an earthly kingdom—implying victory at the Battle of Kosovo—or a heavenly kingdom—which would come as the result of a peaceful capitulation or bloody defeat.

::&quot;...the Prophet Elijah then appeared as a gray falcon to Lazar, bearing a letter from the Mother of God that told him the choice was between holding an earthly kingdom and entering the kingdom of heaven...&quot;

According to the epics, Lazar opted for the eternal, heavenly kingdom and consequently perished on the battlefield. &quot;We die with Christ, to live forever&quot;, he told his soldiers. That Kosovo&#x27;s declaration and testament is regarded as a covenant which the Serb people made with God and sealed with the blood of martyrs. Since then all Serbs faithful to that Testament regard themselves as the people of God, Christ&#x27;s New Testament nation, heavenly Serbia, part of God&#x27;s New Israel. This is why Serbs sometimes refer to themselves as the &quot;people of Heaven&quot;.

Jefimija, the former wife of Uglješa Mrnjavčević and later a nun in the Ljubostinja monastery, embroidered the &quot;Praise to Prince Lazar&quot;, one of the most significant works of medieval Serbian literature. The Serbian Orthodox Church canonised Lazar as Saint Lazar. He is celebrated on (Vidovdan). Several towns and villages (like Lazarevac), small Serbian Orthodox churches and missions throughout the world are named after him. His alleged remains are kept in Ravanica Monastery.

==Titles==
It is uncertain since when Lazar had borne the title of &quot;knez&quot;, which is usually translated as &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;duke&quot;. The earliest source that testifies to Lazar&#x27;s new title is a Ragusan document in Latin, dated 22 April 1371, in which he is referred to as &quot;Comes Lazarus&quot;. Ragusans used &quot;comes&quot; as a Latin translation of the Slavic title &quot;knez&quot;. The same document relates that Lazar held Rudnik at that time. In medieval Serbia, &quot;knez&quot; was not a precisely defined term, and the title had no fixed rank in the feudal hierarchy. Its rank was high in the 12th century, but somewhat lower in the 13th century and the first half of the 14th century. During the reign of Tsar Uroš, when the central authority declined, the high prestige of the title of &quot;knez&quot; was restored. It was borne by the mightiest regional lord, Vojislav Vojinović, until his death in 1363.

In the period between 1374 and 1379 the Serbian Church recognized Lazar as the &quot;Lord of Serbs and Podunavlje&quot; (господар Срба и Подунавља). In 1381, he is signed as &quot;&quot;knez&quot; Lazar, of Serbs and Podunavlje&quot; (). In an inscription from Ljubostinja dated to 1389, he is mentioned as &quot;&quot;knez&quot; Lazar, of all Serbs and Podunavlje provinces&quot; (). In Hungary, he was known as the &quot;Prince of the Kingdom of Rascia&quot;.

In charters issued between 1379 and 1388, he named himself as Stefan Lazar. &quot;Stefan&quot; was the name borne by all Nemanjić rulers, leading the name to be regarded as a title of Serbian rulers. Tvrtko added &quot;Stefan&quot; to his name when he was crowned king of the Serbs and Bosnia. In the charters, Lazar referred to himself as the autocrator (&quot;samodržac&quot; in Serbian) of &quot;All Serbian Lands&quot; (), or the autocrator of &quot;All the Serbs&quot; (). Autocrator, &quot;self-ruler&quot; in Greek, was an epithet of the Byzantine emperors. The Nemanjić kings adopted it and applied it to themselves in its literal meaning to stress their independence from Byzantium, whose supreme suzerainty they nominally recognized.

<text>Stepan &quot;Stepa&quot; Stepanović (, ;  – 29 April 1929) was a Serbian military commander who fought in the Serbo-Turkish War, the Serbo-Bulgarian War, the First Balkan War, the Second Balkan War and World War I. Having joined the Serbian military in 1874, he fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire in 1876. Over the following years, he climbed up the ranks of the Serbian Army and fought against Bulgarian forces in 1885. He eventually became the Serbian Minister of War in April 1908 and was responsible for instituting changes in the Serbian Army.

Stepanović commanded Serbian forces during the two Balkan Wars and led the Serbian Second Army during World War I. After Battle of Cer he was promoted to second Field Marshal. He died in Čačak on 29 April 1929.

==Early childhood and education==

Stepan &quot;Stepa&quot; Stepanović was born on 28 February 1856 in the village of Kumodraž, near Belgrade. He was the fourth child and third son of Ivan and Radojka Stepanović (&quot;née&quot; Nikolić). Stepanović was named after his grandfather Stepan, from whom his family&#x27;s surname originated. There are two theories of his family origins. The first states that Stepanovic&#x27;s ancestors, who were known as Živanović, came from the regions of Bosnia and Lika. The second theory is that his ancestors came from the vicinity of Leskovac and Pirot during the Great Serb Migrations.

Due to housework, Stepanović&#x27;s mother had little time for him and often left him in the care of her mother-in-law. Prior to attending primary school, he looked after cattle and was once hurt badly by a bull. Stepanović finished triennial primary school in Kumodraž and attended gymnasium in Captain Miša&#x27;s Mansion. To finish his schooling, he often served wealthier Belgrade families. He finished his first year of school with good grades and continued receiving good grades throughout the rest of his education. In September 1874, Stepanović enlisted in the XI class of the Belgrade artillery school instead of attending his sixth year of gymnasium. He did not have to write an entrance exam because he had completed five years of gymnasium. His class had twenty-nine cadets.

At the time, the Belgrade artillery school possessed a technical character and paid much attention to knowledge of mathematics, a subject in which Stepanović always performed poorly. Stepanović was also not very good in foreign languages, although he read Russian and French literature. After Herzegovina Uprising broke out, the Principality of Serbia began preparing for war with the Ottoman Empire and the Belgrade artillery school initiated a program of practical martial training. In September 1875, Stepanović and his classmates all received the rank of corporal. After passing an exam, Stepanović became junior sergeant in May 1876. In June 1876, war erupted between Serbia and Ottoman Turkish forces in the Balkans, most of whom were Albanians from Kosovo. Stepanović and the entire XI class quickly received the ranks of sergeant and were sent to the frontline.

==Serbo-Turkish Wars==
Stepanović arrived in Kragujevac on 14 May 1876. Here, he was assigned to orderly officer duty in the headquarters of the Šumadija Division, commanded by Colonel Ljubomir Uzun-Mirković, whose orders were carried by Stepanović. The Šumadija division was the main part of the Moravian Army, but after a change of battle plans, it was divided in several squadrons. Stepanović was assigned to Uzun-Mirković&#x27;s squadron, which had orders to help the Knjaževac Army take Babina Glava and Bela Palanka in order to stop the arrival of Ottoman reinforcements to Niš. Eventually, Babina Glava was taken and Stepanović was noted by Uzun-Mirković for &quot;being very agile and for good riding.&quot; Soon after, the Ottomans launched a counter-offensive against Uzun-Mirković&#x27;s squadron, which retreated to Pandrilo. The Ottomans attacked Pandrilo on 19 July, beginning a battle in which Stepanović actively participated. Stepanović&#x27;s participation alongside regular Serbian soldiers raised moral and helped turn the tide of the battle. This experience affected Stepanović greatly and he often resorted to fighting alongside other Serbian soldiers to raise their moral.

After the fall of Knjaževac, Stepanović and his squadron moved from Deligrad to Sokobanja in order to prevent the Ottomans from reaching the Morava Valley. In Sokobanja, Serb forces regrouped and formed the IV Army Corps, under the command of Colonel Đura Horvatović. Stepanović subsequently joined this unit.

The IV Army Corps marched across Kurilovo and reached Vinik where it attacked Ottoman positions. It then moved on to Deligrad, where it arrived on 7 September. The IV Army Corps clashed with the Turks on 11 September near Krevet, in a battle which ended indecisively.

An armistice between Serb and Ottoman Turkish forces was declared 1 November 1876. On 1 December, Stepanović was awarded the gold medal for Bravery and was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant. On 13 February 1877, he was appointed commander of the 3rd Company of the 3rd Battalion of the Serbian Army. Later, Stepanović participated in the capture of Pirot. Under the overall command of General Jovan Belimarković, Stepanović and his 300-strong force attacked the left flank of Nišor, one of two locations that the Ottomans had fortified in the town. Between 26 and 27 September, Stepanović&#x27;s unit passed unnoticed around Nišor and took Mali vrh. On the morning of 27 September, when the main Serbian attack began, his squad opened fire on Nišor, confusing the Ottomans stationed there. Afterwards, Pirot was captured. One soldier from Stepanović&#x27;s unit said: &quot;I find that, if I’m not wrong, our action struck the main blow to the Turkish position on Nišor and had resolved the fate of Pirot.&quot; Stepanović was later awarded the Order of St. Svetislav III Class with Swords and Ribbon, his favourite of all awards he had received throughout his career because he considered himself &quot;[the] first to have entered the Turkish trench.&quot;

On 3 December, the Šumadija Corps began its march from Pirot to Niš in two echelon formations. During this march, Stepanović commanded a half-battalion of infantry and some cavalry that moved across the difficult terrain of Suva Planina. Nevertheless, all of his men survived the trek and appeared ready for battle. Stepanović later stated that the march across the mountain was his toughest assignment in the war.

On 23 January 1878, the Serbian high command ordered the Šumadija division to capture the town of Vranje. The Šumadija division then drove the Ottomans from Poljanica and defeated Grdelička klisura. On 25 January, Stepanović became commander of a volunteer squad which armed local Serbs in Poljanica. At the battle for Vranje several days later, Stepanović attacked the Ottomans from the north of the town at Devotin.

==Peacetime==
Once the war ended, Stepanović took additional classes at the Belgrade Military Academy to finish his schooling, completing them all by 1880. In September of that year, he requested a transfer to Kragujevac. There, he gained command of the 2nd Company of 3rd Battalion of the Serbian Army. In October, he became commander of the 1st Company in the same battalion.

In Kragujevac, Stepanović met his future wife Jelena, the daughter of the city&#x27;s chief, Velislav Milanović. The two married on 25 July 1881. Their first child, Milica, was born on 21 April 1882. The following year Jelena gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second daughter, Danica. Both of Stepanović&#x27;s daughters went on to marry officers, Milica marrying second lieutenant Krsta Dragomirović and Danica marrying 1st Class captain Jovica Jovičić, who later became a division general in the Serbian Army.

In his first official evaluation in the last quarter of 1880, a special military commission wrote described Stepanović as:
On 1 September 1882, Stepanović was promoted to the rank of infantry lieutenant and he became a commander in Užice, where he remained until 13 February 1883, when he returned to Kragujevac. Upon his arrival in Kragujevac, he was appointed as military adjutant in the Šumadija Infantry Regiment. That same year, Serbia listed made military exercises mandatory in gymnasium programs. Stepanović subsequently became a teacher of military exercises in the First Kragujevac Gymnasium. He remained in this position until 1886.

==Serbo-Bulgarian War (1885)==
During the Battle of Slivnitsa, Stepanović commanded the 1st Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Šumadija division. His unit attacked the village of Vrapče and forced Bulgarian forces to retreat. In a report that Stepanović sent to the commander of the 12th Regiment a lack of coordination between divisions, regiments and battalions of the Serbian Army is perceptible.

Several days later, Stepanović became commander of the 1st Battalion in the 12th Regiment and together with troops from another unit attacked the weakened Bulgarian center on Slivnitsa. The Bulgarians began retreating, allowing Serb forces to take over region around the village of Aldomirovtsi. In his report, Stepanović wrote about his soldiers: &quot;The behavior of the soldiers in this battles was excellent because they showed great curability despite moving over the open field during crossfire. The behavior of the officers was satisfactory in regard of courage and good command of the troops.&quot;

With Serbian forces being pushed out of Bulgaria, King Milan ordered a general retreat of the Serbian Army towards Pirot on 19 November. Three days later, Bulgarian forces marched towards the town and launched an attack on Neškov vis. Stepanović&#x27;s 12th Regiment was forced to retreat. Stepanović later reported: &quot;...I moved along to the hospital towards where bulks of our troops retreated. No effort of the elders could bring them back. More soldiers followed them and then that ridiculous mob pushed away officers who tried to stop them.&quot;

==Rise==
With the end of the Serbo-Bulgarian war, Stepanović returned to Kragujevac, where he stayed until November 1886. In Kragujevac, he commanded a company of the 10th regiment. At the end of 1886, he was promoted to the rank of II class infantry captain. He was an aspirant in the Serbian General Staff from 22 November 1886 to 22 October 1888. At the meeting which was held at the end of 1888, the General Staff&#x27;s commission stated ″that II class captain Mr. Stepanović showed enough qualification and proof for headquarters&#x27; service&quot;, concluding that &quot;he should be approved to start an exam this winter for the rank of I class captain.″

In March 1889, Stepanović reported for this exam, and the commission gave him permission on 2 April to start. From 2–6 April, Stepanović completed the theoretic part of his exam in twelve subjects. He was released of doing practical part of exam, because he received very good grade on headquarters&#x27; journeys and missions. Shortly before the exam, he became the executive of Drina divisional area. After his exams he moved to Valjevo. On 17 April 1889, he became I Class captain.

From 29 March to 15 April 1892, Stepanović wrote and successfully passed an exam for the rank major in the same time as Milutin Milanović and Živojin Mišić. Stepanović became commander of the 5th Battalion in Požega on 13 September 1892. He was promoted to the rank of major on 8 May of the following year. On 14 August, he was moved to Valjevo to once again serve as the executive of the Drina divisional area. He stayed in Valjevo until 20 October 1895, when he was moved to Belgrade. Stepanović stayed in Belgrade for five months, where he was commander of the 7th Battalion. He also became a part-time professor of military history at the Belgrade Military Academy. On 30 March 1897, he became acting commander of the 6th Infantry Regiment in Belgrade. On 11 May, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and two days later he became commander of the 6th Infantry Regiment. Stepanović became Chief of the General Staff in the Ministry of Defense on 27 October 1898. He served in this position until 15 March 1899, when he became an executive of the general military department of the Ministry of Defense. Although he didn&#x27;t like to work indoors, he made an excellent impression on members of the ministry and was remembered as being very strict and punctual. He was transferred again to Valjevo on 17 October 1900, where he became commander of an infantry brigade in the Drina Division. Because of a misunderstanding on 11 November, he was transferred to Zaječar and assigned as commander of an infantry brigade in the Timok Division. He liked this position and said: ″Troop for an officer is the same as water to a fish, and especially a headquarters officer. There he can show what he knows and he can show results. The office kills the spirit, drains the strength and changes man into mechanism.″

On 18 August 1901, Stepanović was promoted to headquarters colonel, and on 11 November he became deputy executive of the active military command of the Serbian Army. He was served in this position until 15 December 1902, when he became an executive of the General Staff. Later, King Alexander I decorated him with Order of the Cross of Takovo II class. Stepanović continued in his role as a professor of military history, lecturing Napoleonic warfare from the period 1796–1805. He was also the editor of military magazine known as &quot;Warrior&quot; ().

The May Overthrow which occurred on 28/29 May 1903 did not affect Stepanović&#x27;s career. After the overthrow, he became section head of the common department in the Ministry of Defense, and then became commander of the Šumadija Division. Because of these promotions, many historians have come to believe that Stepanović was on the side of the conspirators that overthrew the Obrenović dynasty despite his stated neutrality on the matter. After coming to power, Peter I decorated Stepanović with the Order of the Star of Karađorđe III degree on 29 June 1904. Emulating General Đura Horvatić, Stepanović then instituted Prussian-style military drills in his division and punished every irregularity, inaccuracy, legal offence and confiscation of state property.

In the spring of 1906 in Kragujevac, where Stepanović was garrisoned as commander of the Šumadija Division, a so-called corporal counter conspiracy occurred. Some historians believe that the conspiracy was triggered by Stepanović&#x27;s strict regime. The conspiracy involved about thirty officers of the Kragujevac garrison who had planned to take several important public buildings in the town and then to arrest Stepanović. When the plot was uncovered on 30 April, Stepanović had 31 officers arrested. When expressed a desire to have more arrested, he was stopped by Minister of Defense Radomir Putnik.

Stepanović was deeply shook by the conspiracy and later declared:
==Ministry and preparations for the Balkan Wars==
Stepa Stepanović was elevated to the rank of general on 29 June 1907, but stayed as commander of the Šumadija divisional area. Nikola Pašić formed a new government on 12 April 1908 and Stepanović became the Minister of Army. During his mandate, he tried to modernize the military and to remodel old Mauser rifles. He also had new artillery be bought from France and supplied to the Serbian Army. When the army attempted to order machine guns, Stepanović took a different, more conservative approach, as Colonel Vlajić, who worked in Stepanović&#x27;s cabinet, wrote:
In October 1908, after the annexation of Bosnia by Austria-Hungary, massive protests erupted in Serbia and Montenegro. Large numbers of citizens demanded that war be declared against the Austria-Hungarians. Stepanović responded by warning that the country and the army were not ready for war, and that both needed to undertake great amounts of diplomatic, financial and military training. His statements provoked a great amount of criticism from many sides, even in the Serbian press. Consequently, he was dismissed as Minister of Army and became a minister without portfolio at the beginning of 1909. Later that year, he actively assisted Putnik in preparing the Serbian Army for a future war. At the beginning of 1910, Stepanović became commander of the Morava divisional area and undertook the task of preparing the division for armed combat.

At the beginning of March 1911, Stepanović became Minister of Army again. Soon after, Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević became suspicious of Stepanović, whom he believed to be a sympathizer of commander Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis, the leader of the May Overthrow who was said to have wanted a foreign monarch on the Serbian throne. Consequently, the prince rushed to Stepanović and requested that Apis and General Staff major Milovan Milovanović Pilac be transferred from Belgrade. Stepanović responded by saying that he would mention it to the King Peter and allow him to decide whether the two men should be transferred. The prince then unsuccessfully offered his resignation to King Peter.

When Stepanović became Minister of Army for the second time, the government of Serbia realized that the Great Powers intended to divide the Balkan and that the Christian population of the Ottoman Empire was on the verge of rebellion. During his term, Serbia signed several defense agreements with other Balkan countries and created the Balkan League. Stepanović, alongside General Radomir Putnik and Colonel Živojin Mišić, developed plans for mobilization, concentration and strategic development of the Serbian Army for a war against Turkey. In the fall of 1912, the government of Milovan Milovanović resigned after his death and when Marko Trifković formed a new government, Putnik became the new Minister of Defense.

==First Balkan War==

===First operations===
With the start of the First Balkan War, Stepa Stepanović became commander of the 60,000-strong Second Army, which possessed 84 cannons. Concentrated in the Kyustendil–Dupnitsa area, it contained the 1st Timok Infantry Division and the Bulgarian Seventh Rila infantry Division. Its mission was to attack the Turkish rear before the First Army. Informing the Serbian troops that the Seventh Rila Division became part of the Army, Stepanović said: ″I look with confidence at our future work and strongly believe in success, because for centuries separated and now fraternized and embraced, closest brothers, Serbs and Bulgarians represent an irresistible force that will crush all hurdles and liberate downtrodden brothers.″

On 17 October 1912, Putnik informed Stepanović of Serbia&#x27;s declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire. He ordered his army to move closer to the Ottoman border, but not to cross it until further notice. However, the Bulgarian high command ordered the commander of the Rila Division, Georgi Todorov, to cross the Ottoman border and attack Carevo selo and Gornja Džumaja, which he managed to capture. Stepanović congratulated them with the words: ″Hurray heroes of the Seventh division.″

On 18 October, Timok Division started to attack Ottoman positions in direction Rujen-Crni vrh, and next day they captured Crni vrh on the orders of Stepanović. On 21 October, the Serbian high command ordered the Timok Division to advanced towards Kumanovo. Uninformed that the battalion, commanded by Mayor Dobrosav Milenković, had already captured Kriva Palanka without a fight, Stepanović ordered all the necessary maneuvers for capturing the town. This wasted a lot of time, but majority of the division managed to pass through Krivorečka gorge without any resistance. In the early noon, Cavalry Regiment started a fight 5–6 km away from Stracin and managed to capture it at nightfall. Yet again, Stepanović hasn&#x27;t been informed about this event, and next day he ordered his troops to capture Stracin, which wasted a lot of time. After this event, communication was established between the First and the Second armies and the road to Kumanovo was open.

=== Battle of Kumanovo ===

Having not received any order about amassing of the enemy at Kumanovo, general Stepanović ordered Timok Division to take a march towards Kumonovo on 23 October at 6 a.m. At the same time he ordered he commanded the Seventh Division to take over Kočani on 23 October and then to spare some of its forces and send it toward Štip. On 23 October, in the morning, Timok Division attacked Kratovo and thus began the Battle of Kumanovo. 

However, general Todorov obeyed the orders from his High Command, so he only sent one battalion of ten batteries to take over Kočani, which was defended by an entire division. Stepanović, while the Timok Division was on the march, received the note that from Ovče polje and Kočani, strong Ottoman force was marching toward Kratovo. Based on this, he hurried commander of Timok Division to take over Kratovo and to establish defenses toward south side. However, after they arrived in the Kratovo area, colonel Kondić decided that division is tired and should spend the night. Using this, Ottomans took over Crni vrh, which was guarded only by Bulgarian Komita department and one company of Serbs. 

Stepanović did not like the work of both divisions and reported this to Supreme Command. He received answer that 7th Division should unconditionally take over Kočani and Timok Division Crni Vrh. Meanwhile, Stepanović found out that during 23 October, there was battle at Kumanovo. He was surprised by this and was worried about the position of Timok Division, but still looked for a way to help the First army. He ordered Timok Division to take over Crni vrh on 24 October, but this was done tomorrow on 25 October.

The next day, High Command informed Stepanović that at the request of the Bulgarian government it was decided that Timok Division should be putt at their disposal, provided that ″he still manage both divisions.″ He immediately gave 14th Serbian Regiment to the 7th Rila Division and ordered general Todorov to steer his forces towards the mouth of the Bregalnica river in order to stop Ottoman retreat towards Prilep, and then he asked for permission to move from Kriva Palanka to Štip in order to command more easily operation.

However, after he arrived in Kratovo he received a dispatch from general Todorov in which he informed that he received the orders from his own High Command to move his forces towards Serez and Demir Hisar, which he already ordered. After reading this, Stepanović moved back to Kriva Palanka to prepare certain forces to aid Bulgarians.

=== Siege of Adrianople ===

General Stepa Stepanović arrived with his headquarters in place called Mustafa Pasha (railway station outside of Adrianople) on 6 November 1912. Immediately he contacted General Nikola Ivanov, Supreme Commander of the Bulgarian Second army and siege troops. His HQ was placed in Mustafa Pasha, where Ivanov&#x27;s was also stationed.

The armistice was signed on 3.December 1912. However, Stepanović didn&#x27;t want his army to lose concentration. He demanded maximum discipline and readiness, even on Christmas Eve. During armistice, Stepanović managed to improve the supply of his army. Bulgarian Supreme Command accepted to supply Serbian Second army, but Stepanović wasn&#x27;t satisfied with quality. so he demanded that the quality of bread, meat and other articles improve. Because he didn&#x27;t come to agreement with Bulgarian command, he asked Serbian Supreme Command to send supply in order to ″preserve the health and morale of soldiers.″ After the two months of preparation, on 24 March 1913 begun 3-day battle for capturing Adrianople. His Timok Division captured whole northern sector of the battlefield in only 45 minutes without artillery backup and pulle the bulk of Adrianople fortress artillery fire.

At the end of the day, it was decided that tomorrow at night, attack should be launched in order to capture antipersonnel obstacles. When attack commenced, on the front of Timok Division, Ottomans tried to recapture their positions, but they were unsuccessful. General Stepanović looked attack live from high ground behind Danube Division. Nikola Aranđelović, who was in charge of army telegraph, described the atmosphere:
At 5.30 am, Stepanović ordered Serbian troops to move in decisive attack on the front line, in order to help Bulgarian push on eastern sector, which fell around 8 am. At 8.30 am, two Ottoman officers came to Serbian 20th regiment to negotiate the surrender on the account of Shukri Pasha. Having not receiving any response, Pasha sent his adjutant to 20th regiment with message that Shukri Pasha wants to negotiate with General Stepanović. Stepanović replied that he was not authorized by the commander to conduct negotiations and that he should address General Ivanov. In the meantime Timok Division captured antipersonnel line and Danube Division captured point Papas-tepe. General Stepanović moved behind front lines of Danube regiments, and at 11 am was on Bekčitepe, near Marash, which was captured by 4th Serbian Regiment. At 11.30 am, Bulgarian officers came to Shukri Pasha&#x27;s headquarters, and he surrendered to General Ivanov at 12.15 pm, but he returned to his headquarters an hour later on his personal wish. He was eventually captured by Serbian troops an hour later.

After Adrianople fell, Stepanović formed combined detachment on 27 March and marched solemnly into the conquered city. Few days later, he ordered that on Chernomen, exactly on the place where according to history the Battle of Maritsa took place, a memorial should be held to the fallen heroes. According to the participants, it was striking and touching moment. Soon after, Stepanović started preparations to transport his army back to Serbia. Bulgarian government didn&#x27;t give him enough trains to transport his troops back, so he threatened that he will take his army back to Serbia on foot. After this, Bulgarians relented and he transferred whole army from 1 April to 9 May.

At the beginning of World War I he acted as the representative of the absent chief of staff Radomir Putnik. He was responsible for mobilization and some war preparations. After Putnik&#x27;s return he took command of the Second Army.

This was the first allied victory of the war, and he was promoted to Field Marshal. His army achieved successes in the Battle of the Drina and Battle of Kolubara, in addition to the defence of Serbia in 1915.

The Second Army advanced to the Bulgarian border and from there, after Bulgarian capitulation on 29 September 1918 turned West towards Bosnia and the Adriatic Sea.

<text>Živojin Mišić (; 19 July 1855 – 20 January 1921) was a field marshal who participated in all of Serbia&#x27;s wars from 1876 to 1918. He directly commanded the First Serbian army in the Battle of Kolubara and in breach of the Thessaloniki Front was the Chief of the Supreme Command. He is the most decorated Serbian military officer in history.

==Early years==
Mišić&#x27;s grandfather was born in Struganik near Mionica. His parents Radovan and Anđelija (born Damjanović - Koštunjić) had thirteen children.
Živojin was the youngest child, and when he was born, only eight of his brothers and sisters were still alive. When he turned 6, he became a shepherd. He finished primary school in Kragujevac. In his memories, he mentions troubles he had with the city kids that teased him because of his peasant origin. In 1868, he started his gymnasium education in Kragujevac, where he finished the 1st, 2nd, and 6th grade. He finished the third and fourth grade in Belgrade. In the first five gymnasium grades he was not a particularly good student, but he finished the 6th grade with much greater success. Because of that, he was admitted to the Military Academy in 1874, ranked 19th. On every holiday he visited his village, and often he worked in the field with his brothers. Later, on 25 November 1884, he married a German woman, Louise Krikner (1865-1956), at Ascension Church in Belgrade, and they had six children, three sons and three daughters.

He participated with distinction in the Serbo-Turkish wars of 1876 and 1878 with the rank of lieutenant JG of the infantry and in the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885 as a full lieutenant - a company commander in the 5th infantry regiment of Drinska division.

Sometime after the assassination of King Aleksandar Obrenović (see May Overthrow), he was forced to retire, supposedly through the influence of the &quot;Black Hand&quot; as he was considered too close to the Obrenović dynasty, but was reactivated on the personal insistence of the Chief of Staff of the High command of the Serbian Army, General Radomir Putnik who made him his aide.

==Military career==
In the Balkan wars Mišić was the assistant chief of staff of the Supreme Command of vojvode Radomir Putnik, his right-hand man. After the Battle of Kumanovo of the First Balkan War, he was promoted to General. During the critical moments of the Bulgarian surprise offensive at the Battle of Bregalnica of the Second Balkan War, when most of the staff suggested that the Serbian army should withdraw to the second line of defence, Mišić (still the Aide of the Chief of Staff) strongly disagreed and persuaded Putnik to order the army to repel the attack on the first line, thus contributing greatly to the Serbian victory in the battle.

During the July Crisis of 1914 Mišić effectively deputised for the ailing Putnik (then recuperating at a spa in Hungary). Defending against the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia, Mišić (who had emerged from retirement to do so) was placed in command of the Serbian First Army; in December 1914, he won a decisive victory at the Battle of Kolubara that resulted in the humiliating expulsion of Austro-Hungarian forces from Serbia. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of Field Marshal in recognition of his efforts in winning such a sweeping Serbian victory.

Although Mišić participated in the great retreat of the Serbian Army through the winter mountains of Albania during the winter of 1915–16, harried by the second combined German and Austro-Hungarian invasion force (ultimately joined by Bulgaria), he remained in favour of halting and making a final stand against Serbia&#x27;s combined enemies. He was over-ridden however by both King Peter and the other Army commanders at a meeting in Peć, and was followed by the withdrawal of the Serbian army through Montenegro and Albania.

Having suffered badly from exposure during the epic retreat, Mišić recovered. At the Thessaloniki front in 1916, Mišić commanded the First Army, which stopped and forced the withdrawal of the Bulgarian army at the Battle of Gornicevo. Towards the end of the war in June 1918 Mišić was appointed Chief of the Supreme Command and commanded the Serbian army during the breakthrough of the Salonika front in September 1918. He was a lecturer at the Military Academy in Belgrade, and the end of his military career was greeted in 1918 with appointment as the Chief of General Staff of Army of The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

==Memoirs==

During his hospitalization in France prior to his death Mišić began writing his memoirs, titled &quot;Moje uspomene&quot; (&quot;My memories&quot; in English). He managed to cover his entire life up to the start of the Second Balkan War but died before he could cover it and the First World War.

In his book, the famous general did not hesitate to present the reality of life in Serbia and the harsh parts of participating in war; the reality of the Serbian Army, which had mostly inexperienced peasants; and the problems Serbian peasants had at beginning of the second half of the 19th century with new laws about land peasants owned and the beginning of political life in Serbia. Notable in Mišić&#x27;s book was his observation of how contemporary Serbs were naive and overly idealistic: &quot;As the Russian lancer squadron moved into a battle, I noticed how our people are naive, since we all believed that that squadron will make miracles up on hills fighting Turks, and that we will succeed in pushing Turks out from battle. But the Russian squadron soon broke apart and they went in some other direction.&quot;

==Death==
Mišić died in a Belgrade hospital of lung cancer in 1921.

==Legacy==

He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

<doc id="326141" wikidata="Q566764" url="?curid=326141" title="Nikolaj Velimirović">
<text>Nikolaj Velimirović (Serbian Cyrillic: Николај Велимировић;  – ) was bishop of the eparchies of Ohrid and Žiča (1920–1956) in the Serbian Orthodox Church. An influential theological writer and a highly gifted orator, he was often referred to as the new John Chrysostom and historian Slobodan G. Markovich calls him &quot;one of the most influential bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the twentieth century&quot;.

As a young man, he came close to dying of dysentery and decided that he would dedicate his life to God if he survived. He lived and was tonsured as a monk under the name &quot;Nikolaj&quot; in 1909. He was ordained into the clergy, and quickly became an important leader and spokesman for the Serbian Orthodox Church, especially in its relations with the West. When Nazi Germany occupied Yugoslavia in World War II, Velimirović was imprisoned and eventually taken to Dachau concentration camp. After being released by Germans in December 1944, Velimirović spent time in Slovenia, where he blessed anti-communist volunteers such as Dimitrije Ljotić and other Nazi collaborators. After the war, he moved to the United States in 1946, where he remained until his death in 1956. He strongly supported the unity of all Eastern Orthodox churches and established particularly good relationships with the Anglican and Episcopal Churches.

Nikolaj is held in high regard in the Serbian Orthodox Church and among Serbian right-wing political elite. On 24 May 2003, he was glorified as a saint by the Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church as Saint Nikolaj of Ohrid and Žiča (). Many of his views and writings remain controversial. Nikolaj&#x27;s critics point out to instances of antisemitism in his work, to his admiration of Adolf Hitler and to his links with Ljotić.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
He was born as Nikola Velimirović in the small village of Lelić, Valjevo in the Principality of Serbia, on the day of the feast of Saint Naum of Ohrid, whose monastery would later be his episcopal see. He was the first of nine children born to Dragomir and Katarina Velimirović (née Filipović), pious farmers. Being very weak, he was baptised soon after his birth in the Ćelije monastery. He was given the name Nikola because Saint Nicholas was the family&#x27;s patron saint. The first lessons about God, Jesus Christ, the lives of the saints and the holy days of the Church year were provided to him by his mother, who also regularly took him to the Ćelije monastery for prayer and Holy Communion.

===Education===

His formal education also began in the Ćelije monastery and continued in Valjevo. He applied for admission into the Military Academy, but was refused because he didn&#x27;t pass the physical exam. He was admitted to the Seminary of Saint Sava in Belgrade, where, apart from the standard subjects, he explored a significant number of writings of both Eastern and Western authors, such as Shakespeare, Voltaire, Nietzsche, Marx, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and others. He graduated in 1905.

Nikola had been chosen to become a professor in the Seminary of Saint Sava, but it was decided that he needed to pursue further Eastern Orthodox studies before becoming a teacher. As an outstanding student, he was chosen to continue his studies in Russia and Western Europe. He had a gift for languages and soon possessed a good knowledge of Russian, French and German. He attended the Theological Academy in St. Petersburg and then he went to Switzerland and obtained his doctorate of divinity from the Old Catholic Theological Faculty at the University of Berne with magna cum laude.

He received his doctorate in theology in 1908, with the dissertation entitled &quot;Faith in the Resurrection of Christ as the Foundation of the Dogmas of the Apostolic Church&quot;. This original work was written in German and published in Switzerland in 1910, and later translated into Serbian. The dissertation for his doctor&#x27;s degree in philosophy was prepared at Oxford and defended in Geneva, in French. The title was &quot;Berkeley&#x27;s Philosophy&quot;.

His stay in Britain left an impact on his views and education, which is seen from the fact that he quotes or mentions Charles Dickens, Lord Byron, John Milton, Charles Darwin, Thomas Carlyle, Shakespeare and George Berkeley.

===Monastic life===
In the autumn of 1909, Nikola returned home and became seriously ill with dysentery. He decided that if he recovered he would become a monk and devote his life to God. At the end of 1909 his health got better and he was tonsured a monk, receiving the name Nikolaj. He was soon ordained a hieromonk and then elevated to the rank of Archimandrite. In 1910 he was entrusted with a mission to Great Britain in order to gain the co-operation of the Church of England in educating the young students who had been evacuated when the Austrian, German and Bulgarian forces threatened to overwhelm the country.

===Missions during World War I===
Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, he was appointed by the Serbian government to a mission in the United States. In 1915, as an unknown Serbian monk, he toured most of the major U.S. cities, where he held numerous lectures, fighting for the union of the Serbs and South Slavic peoples. During Velimirović&#x27;s US-campaign occurred the great retreat of the Serbian Army through the mountains of Albania. He embarked home in 1916; as his country was now in enemy hands, he went to Britain instead. Not only did he fulfill his mission, but he was also awarded a Doctorate of Divinity &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the University of Cambridge.

He gave a series of notable lectures at St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, and preached in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, making him the first Eastern Orthodox Christian to preach at St Paul&#x27;s. Professor at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology Bogdan Lubardić has identified three phases in the development of Velimirovich&#x27;s ideas: the pre-Ohrid phase (1902–1919), the Ohrid phase (1920–1936), and the post-Ohrid phase (1936–1956).

===Bishop===
In 1919, Archimandrite Nikolaj was consecrated Bishop of Žiča but did not remain long in that diocese, being asked to take over the office of Bishop in the Eparchy of Ohrid (1920–1931) and Eparchy of Ohrid and Bitola (1931–1936) in southern parts of Kingdom of Yugoslavia. 

He wrote an article for The Times, in which he presented the martyrdom of the Serbian clergy in the First World War. He states that according to official data &quot;the Bulgarian authorities have massacred no fewer than 148 priests in Eastern Serbia during the period of their occupation in winter 1914&quot;. Among the victims of &quot;Bulgarian savagery&quot; was the Archbishop of Skopje Vićentije Krdžić. Many younger clerics were deported to Bulgaria &quot;to work on the road as manual labourers&quot;, and only a few of them survived &quot;the terrible ordeal&quot;. The Austrian authorities deported &quot;no fewer than 400 priests to their internment camps in Austria&quot;. Many of them &quot;succumbed to cold and hunger&quot;, and those who survived and returned home &quot;have fallen victims to tuberculosis and rheumatism&quot;. Velimović concludes that &quot;probably no part of the Christian Universal Church has lost so much in lives and goods as the Church of Serbia&quot;, because the Serbian clergy was &quot;considered as the incarnation of Yugo-Slav ideal of national liberation&quot; and was &quot;the most vital opposition in the policy of denationalization of Serbs&quot;.

In 1920, for the third time, he journeyed again to the United States, this time on a mission to organize the Serbian Orthodox Diocese of North America. He made another trip to the United States in 1927.

German Chancellor Adolf Hitler awarded him with a civil medal in 1935 for his contribution in 1926 in renovation of the German military cemetery in Bitola. In 1936, he finally resumed his original office of Bishop in the Eparchy of Žiča, returning to the Monastery of Žiča not far distant from Valjevo and Lelić, where he was born.

===Detention and imprisonment in World War II===
During World War II, in 1941, as soon as the German forces occupied Yugoslavia, Bishop Nikolaj was arrested by the Nazis in the Monastery of Žiča after the suspicion of contributing to the resistance. After which he was confined in the Monastery of Ljubostinja. Later he was transferred to the Monastery of Vojlovica (near Pančevo) in which he was confined together with the Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V. On 15 September 1944, both Patriarch Gavrilo V (Dožić) and Bishop Nikolaj were sent to Dachau concentration camp, which was at that time the main concentration camp for clerics arrested by the Nazis. Both Velimirović and Dožić were held as &quot;special prisoners&quot; (&quot;Ehrenhäftlinge&quot;) imprisoned in the so-called &quot;Ehrenbunker&quot; (or &quot;Prominentenbunker&quot;) separated from the work camp area, together with high-ranking Nazi enemy officers and other prominent prisoners whose arrests had been dictated by Hitler directly.

In August 1943 German general Hermann Neubacher became special emissary of the German Foreign Office for Southeastern Europe. From 11 September 1943, he was also made responsible for Albania. In December 1944 as part of a settlement of Neubacher with Milan Nedić and Dimitrije Ljotić Germans were release Velimirović and Dožić who were transferred from Dachau to Slovenia, as the Nazis attempted to make use of Patriarch Gavrilo&#x27;s and Nikolaj&#x27;s authority among the Serbs in order to gain allies in the anti-Communist movements. Contrary to claims of torture and abuse at the camp, Patriarch Dožić testified himself that both he and Velimirović were treated normally. During his stay in Slovenia, Velimirović blessed volunteers of Dimitrije Ljotić and other collaborators and war criminals such as Dobroslav Jevđević and Momčilo Đujić. In the final years of World War II in the book &quot;Reči srpskom narodu kroz tamnički prozor&quot; he says they the Jews condemned and killed Christ &quot;suffocated by the stinking spirit of Satan&quot;, and further he writes that &quot;Jews proved to be worse opponents of God than the pagan Pilate&quot;, &quot;Devil teaches them so, their father&quot;, &quot;the Devil taught them how to rebel against the Son of God, Jesus Christ.&quot; Later, Velimirović and Patriarch Gavrilo (Dožić) were moved to Austria, and were finally liberated by the US 36th Infantry Division in Tyrol in 1945.

===Immigration and Last Years===

After the war he never returned to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but after spending some time in Europe, he finally immigrated as a refugee to the United States in 1946. There, in spite of his health problems, he continued his missionary work, for which he is considered &quot;An Apostle and Missionary of the New Continent&quot; (quote by Fr. Alexander Schmemann), and has also been enlisted as &quot;an American Saint&quot; and included on the icons and frescoes &quot;All American Saints&quot;.

His books were banned by the Yugoslav communist government in 1947.

He taught at several Eastern Orthodox seminaries such as St. Sava&#x27;s Seminary (Libertyville, Illinois), Saint Tikhon&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary and Monastery (South Canaan, Pennsylvania), and St. Vladimir&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary (now in Crestwood, New York).

Velimirović died on 18 March 1956, while in prayer at the foot of his bed before the Liturgy, at St Tikhon&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary in South Canaan Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania, where a shrine is established in his room. He was buried near the tomb of poet Jovan Dučić at the Monastery of St. Sava at Libertyville, Illinois. After the fall of communism, his remains were ultimately re-buried in his home town of Lelić on 12 May 1991, next to his parents and his nephew, Bishop Jovan Velimirović. On 19 May 2003, the Holy Assembly of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church recognized Bishop Nikolaj (Velimirović) of Ohrid and Žiča as a saint and decided to include him into the calendar of saints of Holy Orthodox Church (5 and 18 March).

==Literary criticism==
Amfilohije Radović points out that part of his success lies in his high education and ability to write well and his understanding of European culture.

Literary critic Milan Bogdanović claims that everything Velimirović wrote after his Ohrid years did nothing more than paraphrase Eastern Orthodox canon and dogma. Bogdanović views him as a conservative who glorified the Church and its ceremonies as an institution. Others say he brought little novelty into Eastern Orthodox thought. This, however, is explained by true Orthodox thought, because, as Saint John of Damascus writes, &quot;It is for that reason that I say (teach) nothing of what is mine. I briefly express the thoughts and words passed down by Godly and wise men.&quot;
==Views==
===Nationalism of Saint Sava===
In 1935, Nikolaj held a speech on the &quot;nationalism of Saint Sava&quot;, in which he analyzed the writings of Saint Sava. Saint-savian nationalism is a theological and political term that St. Nikolaj uses to describe Serbian Orthodox Christian nationalism. According to Velimirović, it includes the national church, where the base of the nationalism lies, national dynasty, national state, national education, national culture and national defense.

In his speech, Velimirović theorized that the nationalism of Saint Sava was against racism and hatred, saying that:

&quot;Those of you who fought in the First World War, you can give personal testimony of a rare sight, how our soldiers behaved towards soldiers from Africa and Asia, towards people of black and yellow race, whom the Europeans brought to the battlefield from their colonies. While the Europeans themselves were estranged from their subjects, blacks and yellow-skinned people, not wanting to eat or drink with them or stay under the same tents, until then our soldiers made friends with them, ate and drank, visited them when they were sick, helped them when they were in trouble, at their celebrations congratulated and feasted, talking to them with fingers and hands. Serbs looked at blacks as people and treated them as people. Therefore, there can be no justified objection to Saint-savian nationalism, that it is narrow and exclusive.&quot;

He also stated that the three greatest values of the Serbian people are: God, King and Home.

Nikolaj constructs the nationalism of Saint Sava as an evangelical platform that should serve as a model for the establishment of the national church. This nationalism, unlike nationalism that originates from the Enlightenment and secular tradition, is based on faith as a basic principle. According to Nikolaj, the nationalism of Saint Sava is firstly,
evangelical, because it protects the integrity of the human person and helps its perfection, and secondly, organic, because it protects the individuality of the peoples themselves, preventing them from falling into imperialism and disintegrating into internationalism. By being established on holiness as the highest personal and ecclesiastical ideal, such evangelical nationalism, according to Nikolaj, becomes a barrier to chauvinism and exclusivity toward other nations. According to this Saint-Savian nationalism promoted by Nikolaj, all peoples on earth, regardless of blood, language and religion, are the people of God and brothers among themselves. (page 230)

In his writings from the mid-1930s, Nikolaj pointed to the political deviations of good nationalism. In his article “Between Left and Right” from 1935, Nikolaj criticizes internationalism and fascism, the two most powerful movements and political orders in Europe at that time. Internationalism for Nikolaj was the negation of nation and national determination, while fascism was idolatry of one&#x27;s own nation. (page 229)

===Views on Mihailović&#x27;s Chetniks===
Saint Nikolaj Velimirović and Saint Justin Popović both supported the Chetniks of Mihailović. Velimirović wrote a book called &quot;The land of the dead&quot; in which he expressed support for the Chetnik fight against National Socialist Germany. He held a speech on 18 July 1954 about Draža and his &quot;Saint-savian fight&quot;.

=== Allegations of antisemitism ===

Several of Nikolaj Velimirović&#x27;s writings and public speeches have been identified by historians as containing antisemitic rhetoric and/or hate speech directed at Jews. Notably, the first written record of Velimirović&#x27;s antisemitic beliefs comes over a decade before the start of World War II. In fact, the first chronicled case of Velimirović expressing antisemitic beliefs dates back to a 1927 sermon delivered in the United States. From the 1927 sermon titled &quot;A Story about the Wolf and the Lamb,&quot; Velimirović&#x27;s proclamations are summarized by social psychologist Jovan Byford:

In his take on the well known Christian parable about the wolf and the lamb, Velimirović referred to &quot;Jewish leaders in Jerusalem&quot; at the time of the crucifixion as &quot;wolves,&quot; whose thirst for blood of the Lamb of God was motivated by their &quot;God-hating nationalism.&quot;

Byford&#x27;s summary of Velimirović&#x27;s &quot;A Story about the Wolf and the Lamb&quot; is significant for it serves as evidence that Velimirović may have utilized biblical undertones and Christian parable as a means of &#x27;validating&#x27; his antisemitic statements to his followers. An interview that Jovan Byford conducted with Mladen Obradović (leader of Serbian far-right political organization Obraz) may suggest that this explanation still persists among some members of Serbian Orthodox society. A contemporary defender of Velimirović&#x27;s reputation and saint status, Obradović defends the antisemitic writings of Velimimirović by stating that Velimirović&#x27;s words only echo what had been written in early Christian texts:

You have the very words of the Lord Jesus Christ when he says to the Pharisees that they are a &quot;brood of vipers&quot; or that their father is the Devil; Bishop Nikolaj merely quotes the Gospels.

In a speech delivered in 1936 at the Žica Monastery, Velimirović spoke out against what he perceived to be a Jewish threat to Christianity in front of a distinguished audience that included Yugoslavian Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović. Velimirović used specific lines of this speech to accuse Jews of leading a secretive, coordinated effort against Christianity and &quot;faith in real God&quot;.

Velimirović&#x27;s writing in &quot;Words to the Serbian People Through the Prison Window&quot; is generally seen as the strongest evidence of the Bishop holding antisemitic beliefs. Notably, many proponents of Velimirović&#x27;s ideology suggest that the work is not definitive evidence of the Bishop&#x27;s true ideology and beliefs about Jews and Judaism because they claim that it was written under duress during his time at Dachau. The excerpts from Velimirović&#x27;s &quot;Words to the Serbian People Through the Prison Window&quot; that attract the most attention from scholars studying antisemitism are quoted in Byford as follows:

The Devil teaches them [Jews]; the Devil taught them how to stand against the son of God, Jesus Christ. The Devil taught them through the centuries how to fight against the sons of Christ, against the children of light, against the followers of the Gospel and eternal life [Christians]. [...] Europe knows nothing other than what Jews serve up as knowledge. It believes nothing other than what Jews order it to believe. It knows the value of nothing until Jews impose their own measure of values […] all modern ideas including democracy, and strikes, and socialism, and atheism, and religious tolerance, and pacifism, and global revolution, and capitalism, and communism are the inventions of Jews, or rather their father, the Devil.

Additionally, Byford identifies the antisemitic ideology of Velimirović in the work, &quot;Indian Letters&quot; in which the figure of a Jewish woman portrays Satan. Notably, this example of Velimirović&#x27;s antisemitic portrayal is again linked to conspiracy as Velimirović describes the woman as standing for, &quot;all destructive and secret associations plotting against Christianity, religion, and the state.&quot;

Despite accusations of antisemitism, it is recorded that Velimirović protected a Jewish family by facilitating their escape from Nazi-occupied Serbia. Ela Trifunović (Ela Nayhaus), wrote to the Serbian Orthodox Church in 2001, claiming that she had spent 18 months hiding in the Ljubostinja monastery to which she was smuggled by Velimirović, guarded and later helped move on with false papers. Historians inclined to side with the view that Velimirović&#x27;s writings prove that he held antisemitic beliefs note that this one incidence of the Bishop saving a Jewish family is commonly exaggerated by pro-Velimirović groups as evidence of his universal kindness and selflessness against the several confirmed antisemitic writings tied to Velimirović.

===Views on Germans and Hitler===
Adolf Hitler decorated Nikolaj Velimirović in 1935 for his contributions to the restoration of a German military cemetery in Bitola in 1926. Some claim that the order was returned in protest at German aggression in 1941. In a treatise on St. Sava&#x27;s day in 1935, he supported Hitler&#x27;s treatment of the German national church. St Nikolaj later explained himself in a letter to the American-Canadian bishop Dionysius, where he stated:
&quot;I gave a lecture at Kolarch University on the nationalism of St. Sava, in the year of Saint Sava, which was 1935, and anyone who doesn&#x27;t know that would think that I mentioned the leader of the [German] people during the war. In this last case, why would the Germans arrest me from the first days - until the last? I glorified St. Sava, not Hitler. I said that St. Sava, as a saint, genius and hero of the Serbian people, created the Serbian national church 700 years ago, and united all the Serbian people in that church. A work that has not been repeated anywhere in the West. Pascal tried in the 16th century to create a national Gallican church for the French, but failed.

St. Nikolaj criticized the secularization of Germany, called the ideology of fascism the “European evil,” and referred to Hitler as the “Viennese painter” and “Satanic evil.”

In spite of accusations of collaboration leveled during Communist times, some of Velimirović&#x27;s actions and writings were directed against the Germans who got suspicious of him when he supported the coup in April 1941. They suspected him of collaborating with the Chetniks and formally arrested him and kept him first in Ljubostinja Monastery in 1941 and then in 1944 in Dachau concentration camp. In Dachau, he was imprisoned in &quot;Ehrenbunker&quot;, together with other clergy and high-ranking Nazi enemy officers, and was allowed to wear his own religious clothes, having access to the officer&#x27;s canteen. It is claimed that he was never tortured and had access to officers&#x27; medical services. Contrary to the reports that Velimirović was liberated when the Americans&#x27; 36th Division reached Dachau, both he and Patriarch Dožić were actually released in November 1944, having spent three months in the camp. They travelled to Slovenia, from where Velimirovic continued first to Austria then to United States.

===Views on Ljotić===
Velimirović had a high opinion of Dimitrije Ljotić, a Serbian fascist politician and German collaborationist. However, he never supported him politically. There were many examples in Velimirović&#x27;s letters written during the 1950s, in which he wanted to distance himself from the actions of the Ljotić&#x27;s pro-fascist movement Zbor in the emigration, which he labelled as “national godlessness” in order to differentiate it from the communist godlessness. Velimirović&#x27;s sympathies for religiosity of Dimitrije Ljotić, the leader of Zbor movement, encouraged Ljotić&#x27;s adherents to interpret Velimirović&#x27;s words as the support for Zbor&#x27;s political goals, not only after World War One, but also in the interwar period. On several occasions, Velimirović himself tried to prevent Ljotić&#x27;s political adherents to usurp and exploit the publishing house “Svečanik” in Munich founded by Velimirović for their political goals. Therefore, it would not be difficult to imagine that some of them forged Velimirović&#x27;s writings by interpolating the political agenda of the Zbor movement.

==Legacy==
A monastery is named after him in China, Michigan.

Porfirije, Serbian Patriarch stated that he is one of the three most notable Serb theologians to be recognized internationally. Velimirović is included in the book The 100 most prominent Serbs. In 2023 in Belgrade, on Ascension Day, the city&#x27;s patronal feast, his relics were carried in front of a procession attended by more than 100,000 people, making it the largest procession in the history of Belgrade.

<text>Veljko Petrović (, ; 1780 – 1813), known simply as [[Hajduk]] Veljko (Хајдук Вељко, [xǎjduːk v̞ɛ̌ːʎkɔ]), was one of the &quot;vojvodas&quot; (military commanders) of the Serbian Revolutionary forces in the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, in charge of the Negotin area. He was one of the most prominent leaders of the uprising.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in Lenovac, near Zaječar, in the Crna Reka nahija, into the family of Petar (hence he took &quot;Petrović&quot; as his surname) and Petrinja. He had two younger brothers, Milutin and Miljko. His father was called &quot;Sirenjar Petar&quot; (&quot;Peter the Cheese Maker&quot;) due to his multitude of livestock which he possessed, and the amount of cheese he sold. His father was a very calm person, though Veljko was an unruly kid. In his youth he kept cattle, even becoming &quot;čobanbaša&quot; (&quot;head herder&quot;) among the local herders. The local Turks often visited their house, eating their food, drinking and taking cheese, butter oil, and milk.

Osman Pazvantoğlu&#x27;s &quot;krdžalije&quot; (Ottoman brigands), who were deemed rebels by the Sultan, had fought the Imperial troops at Crna Reka, and then continued to attack local Turks loyal to the Sultan, and burned and devastated several villages in the region, including Lenovac. This prompted Veljko, only 15 years old, to leave his parents and brothers for Vidin. There he was hired as a shepherd by a Turk, and after some time he left for Požarevac, where he was hired by the Vojvoda of Požarevac to prepare food. As he had also spent some time there, at Easter time, he danced the &quot;kolo&quot; with his friends, forgetting to prepare the important dinner for his master. For this, his master chased to beat him, thus Veljko fled, ending up in the &quot;hajduk&quot; (Serbian brigands) bands of Stanoje Glavaš. In the winter time of 1803, Glavaš had arranged for Veljko to stay at the house of a &quot;jatak&quot; (&quot;concealer&quot;, civil hajduk supporter) in Dubona, in the Smederevo nahija, where he would work as a shepherd. In the same village Veljko met Marija, a widow and relative of Glavaš, and married her, moving to her house. Not long after the wedding, the Slaughter of the Knezes took place (January 1804), in which prominent Serb leaders were executed by the Janissary military junta of the Sanjak of Smederevo (these janissaries, under the leadership of Kučuk Alija, had murdered &quot;sanjak-bey&quot; Hadži Mustafa Pasha on 15 December 1801 and taken the rule of the sanjak). As a response to the executions, the Serbian population, without a central figure, took measures of self-defence, and spontaneously attacked the janissaries.

===First Serbian Uprising===

Hearing of Karađorđe&#x27;s activities, Veljko immediately asked his wife for hajduk wear and weapons and joined Glavaš&#x27; bands. When Karađorđe arrived at Orašac on the Meeting of the Lord, February 2, 1804, and was chosen by the people, Glavaš, Janko Katić, Vasa Čarapić, Jakovljević, Vule, and others, to be the &quot;Supreme Leader of the Serb People&quot;, Veljko was present in Glavaš&#x27; &quot;četa&quot; (band of fighters). As the uprising grew and spread, cautious Glavaš opted to withdrow, and Veljko then served the Smederevo Vojvoda Đuša Vulićević fighting the Ottomans. In the fall of 1805, Vojvoda Đuša was killed by the Turks in Smederevo. Karađorđe put Đuša&#x27;s younger brother Vujica Vulićević in his place. Veljko became one of Vujica&#x27;s &quot;buljukbašica&quot; (a commander of a few men).

With Vujica Vulićević he fought to free Belgrade (1806), where he excelled in combat. In 1807 he became a &quot;buljubaša / буљубаша&quot; and is granted permission from the Council to incite rebellion in the areas of Krivi Vir and the surrounding Crna Reka area. In 1809, he, despite being heavily outnumbered, bravely defended Soko Banja against the Turkishs forces. His personal bravery was extraordinary and won him extraordinary praise and fame throughout Serbia and the Balkans. In 1810 he was decorated with the Russian Golden Cross for his bravery.

He was noted in the battle of Varvarin, where he was wounded in his left arm and became slightly crippled. In 1811 he became &quot;Voivoda of the Timok Valley&quot; and he was sent to Negotin, in the Timok Valley. In 1813, a detachment of Turkish cavalry attacked him at the village of Bukovče where Veljko destroyed them. Turks then set forth with much stronger force, so Veljko retreated to Negotin to defend it.

Large battles took place around Negotin in the summer of 1813. The Turks began to lay siege to Negotin with reinforcements from Vlaška (Walachia). In total, 16,000 Turkish soldiers attacked Negotin, which was defended by 3,000 Serbian soldiers. Veljko fortified Negotin, built a moat and towers, and waited for the Turks. The tallest tower in which Veljko resided, was named Baba Finka. In the moats, together with Veljko were his brothers Milutin and Miljko. Also, there were the prominent buljubaše and Dimbaše Hadži-Nikola, Abrašelibalta among many others. The expected aid that Veljko had requested didn&#x27;t arrive, and ammunition was running low, so Veljko ordered all tin objects in the city melted down for ammunition, and he ordered metal coins to be put into the cannons. One morning after twenty days of heroic defence, he ordered repair around his moat and was struck by a cannonball. He died almost immediately. The Battle of Negotin ended in massive Turkish casualties and the successful escape of the Serbian rebels. His brother Milutin buried him at sunset at Negotin&#x27;s church. After Veljko&#x27;s death Turks conquered Negotin and soon all Krajina. He is still remembered for his famous words: &quot;Glavu dajem, Krajinu ne dajem&quot;. (I&#x27;ll give my head, but not Krajina)

Just before the Battle of Negotin, his friend, Vuk Karadžić suggested to him that he send his gold, jewels and other valuables to his family, so they wouldn&#x27;t fall into Turkish hands. But Veljko refused, believing it wouldn&#x27;t be proper for a great hajduk and war hero to be slain and found penniless. Veljko considered his personal reputation and glory more important than mere gold.

==Legacy==

As a popular hero, there existed songs about him even during his lifetime. There exist over 70 lyrical and 10 epic poems about him. Some of the most known songs or epic poems include &quot;My almond tree grew forth&quot; (&quot;Расло ми је бадем дрво&quot;) and &quot;Sickly there lieth Mustapha the Black&quot; (&quot;Болан ми лежи Кара-Мустафа&quot;).

Serbian comic author Živorad Atanacković (1933–1998) created an adventurous comic on the person of Veljko Petrović, with the theme of the First Serbian Uprising (&quot;Hajduk Veljko&quot;, 1966).

Some Bulgarian historians have portrayed fringe theories that Veljko was Bulgarian. 

He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

<doc id="326155" wikidata="Q1220078" url="?curid=326155" title="Diebold Nixdorf">
<text>Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated is an American multinational financial and retail technology company that specializes in the sale, manufacture, installation and service of self-service transaction systems (such as ATMs and currency processing systems), point-of-sale terminals, physical security products, and software and related services for global financial, retail, and commercial markets. Currently Diebold Nixdorf is headquartered in the Akron-Canton area with a presence in around 130 countries, and the company employs approximately 23,000 people. Founded in 1859 in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company, the company eventually changed its name to Diebold Safe &amp; Lock Company. In 1921, Diebold Safe &amp; Lock Company sold the world&#x27;s largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank. Diebold has since branched into diverse markets, and is currently the largest provider of ATMs in the United States. Diebold Nixdorf was founded when Diebold Inc. acquired Germany&#x27;s Wincor Nixdorf in 2016. It is estimated that Wincor Nixdorf controls about 35 percent of the global ATM market.

On June 1, 2023, Diebold Nixdorf filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, saying it reached an agreement to restructure and reduce its debt by $2.1 billion. Its stock was also delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. In August 2023, Diebold Nixdorf emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and rejoined the NYSE.

==Diebold history==
===Diebold Safe &amp; Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)===

Diebold was founded in 1859 in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company. Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant, the company&#x27;s 250 initial employees began manufacturing safes and bank vaults out of a factory in Canton, Ohio. Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand. In 1874, Diebold was contracted to build the world&#x27;s largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch of Wells Fargo. In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio, the company changed its name to Diebold Safe &amp; Lock Company. Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico. Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890, and in 1921, Diebold sold the world&#x27;s largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank. Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s. Also around that time, Diebold introduced a &quot;robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas&quot; to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.

In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems, and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year. Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and &quot;sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 US Army scout cars,&quot; particularly the M2 Scout car model. In 1943, Diebold Safe &amp; Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company&#x27;s increasing diversification of products. The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951, and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold&#x27;s president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947. Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.

===Computer security and ATMs (1960s-1990s)===

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol . In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices. Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world&#x27;s largest double vault doors from Diebold. Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.

Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold&#x27;s annual revenue increased from US$229 million to $451 million. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold&#x27;s president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines. This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA. Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, chairman of the board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.

The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market. After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold&#x27;s staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.

Diebold&#x27;s Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its &quot;ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations&quot; full-time from a singular facility. Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985. Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board. In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world&#x27;s ATMs sold worldwide. Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad. By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States. In 1996, Diebold generated US$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year. The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998, when Diebold purchased IBM&#x27;s share of the partnership for $16.1 million.

===International growth (1998-2001)===
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering &quot;automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions.&quot; Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney, Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition, which was the first of its kind. Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States. In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

In 2001, Diebold acquired Mosler Safe Company in bankruptcy court and took over their operations, including securing the Charters of Freedom (the US Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence) for the US National Archives in Washington, D.C. In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately US$160 million. The agreement put Diebold near &quot;$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis.&quot; By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution. Seeking to expand in India, at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotech, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai. Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.

===Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)===
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment, and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations. DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products, as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold&#x27;s then-CEO Walden O&#x27;Dell in 2003. Critics argued O&#x27;Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold&#x27;s ballots, which O&#x27;Dell denied. Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations. Citing personal reasons, O&#x27;Dell resigned in December 2005 after several consecutive quarters of poor performance, with his role taken by Tom Swidarski. In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions, and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems &amp; Software.

&quot;Wired Magazine&quot; reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location. Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues. In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low. In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer. The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009. In 2009 &quot;Bank Technology News&quot; ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.

===New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)===
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle. By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology. In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement &quot;advanced security solutions&quot; at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. Also that year, &quot;SDM Magazine&quot; named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year. In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the &quot;world&#x27;s first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,&quot; as well as &quot;two-way concierge video services&quot; to its ATMs. After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012, in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil. On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.

CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford Motor Company, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected. Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold&#x27;s new president and CEO in June 2013. Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013, and also &quot;increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year.&quot; In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided &quot;improper gifts&quot; to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.

===Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf acquisition (2014-2017)===
Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an &quot;original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers.&quot; In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims &quot;prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime].&quot; Diebold&#x27;s revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before. Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion. Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.

In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design. Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank. Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for US$350 million. On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts. The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card, while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by &quot;Fortune&quot; as &quot;a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time.&quot;

In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf. with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf. On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the acquisition. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market. The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf&#x27;s facilities in Paderborn, Germany. Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada. Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016. On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the acquisition had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.

==Nixdorf history==
Founded by Heinz Nixdorf, Nixdorf Computer was formed in 1952. In 1990, the company was purchased by Siemens AG and renamed Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme. The company was re-focused exclusively on its current product set in 1998 and renamed Siemens Nixdorf Retail and Banking Systems GmbH. Following a buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners on October 1, 1999, the company was renamed Wincor Nixdorf. The company was taken public May 19, 2004 with a successful IPO. On November 8, 2006, chief executive officer Karl-Heinz Stiller announced his resignation from the board. Eckard Heidloff was elected as his replacement.

==Markets and services==
Diebold Nixdorf markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres. The company is split into three regional divisions including the Americas (including North America and Latin America), and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.

Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to &quot;Bloomberg&quot; Diebold provides services involving &quot;installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services.&quot; The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.

==Products==

Diebold Nixdorf is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to automated service. By 1998, the company offered &quot;automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions,&quot; among other products and services.

===Safes and metal work===

Diebold was founded in 1859 as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults, and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.

===Automated dispensors===

Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines, movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps. In 1965 Diebold began &quot;offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings&quot; and many other industrial facilities. In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.

===Security measures===

Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products, and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution, and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks. The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.

For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as &quot;the industry&#x27;s first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud.&quot;

===Automated teller machines===

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines. Diebold&#x27;s Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972. Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series. InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s. In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition, which was the first of its kind. Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999, in San Francisco&#x27;s City Hall.

In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM), and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.

On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions. On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show. The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan, removing the need for a card. The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by &quot;Fortune&quot; as a &quot;dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time,&quot; with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.

==Diebold Foundation==
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels, as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland&#x27;s Public Square.

<doc id="326157" wikidata="Q336310" url="?curid=326157" title="Skull Tower">
<text>Skull Tower (, ) is a stone structure embedded with human skulls located in Niš, Serbia. It was constructed by the Ottoman Empire following the Battle of Čegar of May 1809, during the First Serbian Uprising. During the battle, Serbian rebels under the command of Stevan Sinđelić were surrounded by the Ottomans on Čegar Hill, near Niš. Knowing that he and his fighters would be impaled if captured, Sinđelić detonated a powder magazine within the rebel entrenchment, killing himself, his subordinates and the encroaching Ottoman soldiers. The governor of the Rumelia Eyalet, Hurshid Pasha, ordered that a tower be made from the skulls of the fallen rebels. The tower is high, and originally contained 952 skulls embedded on four sides in 14 rows.

In 1861, Midhat Pasha, the last Ottoman governor of Niš, ordered that Skull Tower be dismantled. Following the Ottomans&#x27; withdrawal from Niš in 1878, the structure was partially restored, roofed over with a baldachin and some of the skulls that had been removed from it were returned. Construction of a chapel surrounding the structure commenced in 1892 and was completed in 1894. The chapel was renovated in 1937. A bust of Sinđelić was added the following year. In 1948, Skull Tower and the chapel enclosing it were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and came under the protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Further renovation of the chapel occurred again in 1989.

As of , 58 skulls remain embedded in Skull Tower&#x27;s walls. The one that is said to belong to Sinđelić is enclosed in a glass container adjacent to the structure. Seen as a symbol of independence by many Serbs, it has become a popular tourist attraction, visited by between 30,000 and 50,000 people annually.

==History==
===Construction===

The First Serbian Uprising against Ottoman rule erupted in February 1804, with Karađorđe as its leader. On 19 May 1809, 3,000 Serbian rebels under the command of Stevan Sinđelić were attacked by the Ottomans at Čegar Hill, near the village of Kamenica, in Niš. The rebels were plagued by lack of coordination, largely due to the rivalry between commanders Miloje Petrović and Petar Dobrnjac. As a result, Sinđelić&#x27;s fighters failed to receive support from the other rebel detachments. The numerically superior Ottomans lost thousands of soldiers in a number of failed attacks against the rebels, but eventually overwhelmed the Serbian lines. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment&#x27;s gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion. The resulting blast killed him and everyone else in the vicinity.

After the battle, the governor of the Rumelia Eyalet, Hurshid Pasha, ordered that the heads of Sinđelić and his men be skinned, stuffed and sent to the Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II. Upon being viewed by the sultan, the skulls were then returned to Niš, where the Ottomans built Skull Tower as a warning to residents contemplating rebellion. The Ottoman Empire was known to create tower structures from the skulls of rebel fighters in order to elicit terror among its opponents. Skull Tower was constructed on the road from Istanbul to Belgrade. It was built of sand and limestone. The structure is high. It originally consisted of 952 skulls embedded on four sides in 14 rows. The locals named it &quot;ćele kula&quot;, from the Turkish &quot;kelle kulesi&quot;, which means &quot;skull tower&quot;.

The French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine visited the tower while passing through Niš in 1833. By that time, the skulls had already been bleached from exposure to the elements. &quot;My eyes and my heart greeted the remains of those brave men whose cut-off heads made the cornerstone of the independence of their homeland,&quot; de Lamartine later wrote. &quot;May the Serbs keep this monument! It will always teach their children the value of the independence of a people, showing them the real price their fathers had to pay for it.&quot; De Lamartine&#x27;s account attracted many Western travellers to Niš. Skull Tower was also mentioned in the works of the British travel writer Alexander William Kinglake, published in 1849.

===Dismantling and conservation===

In the years following its construction, many skulls fell out from the tower walls, some were taken away for burial by relatives thinking they could identify the skulls of their deceased family members, and some were taken by souvenir hunters. Midhat Pasha, the last Ottoman governor of Niš, ordered that Skull Tower be dismantled in 1861. He realized that the structure no longer served as an effective means of discouraging potential rebels and only fostered resentment against the Ottomans, reminding locals of the empire&#x27;s cruelty. During the dismantling, the remaining skulls were removed from the tower.

After the Ottomans withdrew from Niš in 1878, the Royal Serbian Army scoured the town and its surroundings in search of the missing skulls. One was found embedded deep inside the tower walls and sent to the National Museum in Belgrade. This was followed by the construction of a roof baldachin, which was topped off with a cross. This is how the structure is depicted in an 1883 painting by the realist Đorđe Krstić. In 1892, work commenced on the construction of a chapel that was to enclose the tower. The foundations of the chapel, designed by the architect Dimitrije T. Leko, were consecrated in 1894. A plaque dedicated near the chapel in 1904 reads: &quot;To the first Serbian liberators after Kosovo.&quot;

The chapel was renovated in 1937 and a bust of Sinđelić was added the following year. In 1948, Skull Tower and the chapel were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and came under the protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Further renovation of the chapel occurred again in 1989. As of , 58 skulls remain embedded in the tower walls. The one said to belong to Sinđelić rests in a glass container adjacent to the structure.

==Legacy==

Skull Tower remains one of the most prominent symbols of Ottoman rule in Serbia. It &quot;continues to serve as an important heritage site for Serbian national identity,&quot; the political scientist Bilgesu Sümer writes. In Serbia, and among Serbs both inside and outside the country, it is considered a symbol of the country&#x27;s struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. In the centuries following its construction, it has become a place of Serb pilgrimage. Prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia, tens of thousands of schoolchildren from across Yugoslavia visited the structure. Skull Tower remains one of the most visited destinations in Serbia, attracting between 30,000 and 50,000 visitors annually.

The Serbian poet considers Skull Tower to be emblematic of what he terms &quot;Balkan horror&quot;. Drawing on themes from Serbian history, in 1957, composer Dušan Radić composed the cantata &quot;Ćele kula&quot;. Skull Tower is also the subject of the eponymous fourth cycle of modernist Vasko Popa&#x27;s fourth collection of poems, &quot;Uspravna zemlja&quot; (Earth Erect), which was completed in 1971. The structure was featured on the cover of the Serbian rock band &quot;Riblja Čorba&quot;&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Istina&quot;, with the band members&#x27; faces embedded in the tower walls. The cover was designed by the artist Jugoslav Vlahović.

An exhibition at the Military Museum in Belgrade contains a replica of the tower. In 2024, a group of anthropologists from Serbia began the forensic reconstruction of the faces of the remaining skulls; a DNA analysis of the skulls was not carried out as this would damage both the skulls and the tower. The project was funded with private donations from Serbia and several surrounding countries.

<text>Stevan Sinđelić (; 1771 – 19 May 1809) was a Serbian revolutionary commander in Resava, who fought during the First Serbian Uprising (1804–1813) against Ottoman rule. As the commander of the Resava Brigade, he fought in many battles and skirmishes against Ottoman foot-soldiers, including the Battle of Ivankovac in 1805 and the Battle of Deligrad in 1806. He is remembered for his actions during the Battle of Čegar Hill in 1809, in which he and the Resava Brigade found themselves surrounded by the Ottomans. Encircled and without much chance of survival, Sinđelić ignited the gunpowder kegs in the powder cave, creating an enormous explosion that killed him, along with all of the Serbian and Ottoman soldiers in his trench.

==Early life==
Stevan Rakić was born in 1771, in the village of Grabovac in the &quot;Morava Okrug&quot;, Ottoman Smederevo (in present-day Svilajnac, Serbia). His father, &quot;zanatlija&quot; (craftsman) Radovan Rakić, died at a young age and his mother Sinđelija later remarried. People called him by the matronymic &quot;Sinđelić&quot;.

Before the Serbian Uprising, he worked for Duke Petar in Resava, whom the &quot;dahi&quot; murdered during the Slaughter of the Dukes massacre that would spark the revolution. Long before the start of the Uprising, Karađorđe Petrović, when traveling cross the Velika Morava, met with Sinđelić and discussed the revolution with him. Later, Sinđelić gathered people from the Resava region to take part in the Uprising against the Ottoman government. He was notified directly as Karađorđe Petrović was chosen to lead the Uprising, proclaimed on 14 February 1804.

==First Serbian Uprising==
Steven Sinđelić, at the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising in 1804, formed a military unit with other peasants in the Resava region. The Ottoman garrison, which was located in Ćuprija, immediately moved to crush the Serb revolutionaries. Sinđelić was informed of the Ottomans&#x27; actions by a spy and maneuvered his forces between the towns of Svilajnac and Ćuprija. The Ottomans were defeated.

Afterwards, Sinđelić fought in the Battle of Ivankovac (1805) with Milenko Stojković and Petar Dobrnjac, where the combined forces of the three military commanders defeated Ottoman General Hafis Pasha. In Ivankovac, Sinđelić proved himself as a good and capable military leader and he was subsequently appointed to be the Commander of the Resava Infantry Brigade by Karađorđe Petrović who was the commander-in-chief of the Serbian Revolutionary Army.

Sinđelić later fought the Ottomans in a guerrilla campaign in the Morava Valley and his forces liberated the towns of Ćuprija, Paraćin, Ražanj and many areas that were located just north of Deligrad. There, the Serbian forces became entrenched. They were awaited by the large Army of Ottoman Commander Huršid Pasha whose forces were stationed in the Niš Fortress. 
 
Stevan&#x27;s Brigade fought the Ottomans in areas that were located south of the city of Niš. His detachment became entrenched in the village of Kamenica on Čegar hill, not far from the Ottoman front-line. The Serbs then launched several attacks against the Niš Fortress, but each time they were repulsed by the numerically superior Ottomans. After a two-month-long struggle, the Ottomans engaged in a counter-attack against the Serb positions on 19 May 1809 . Sinđelić and his Brigade became separated from the remainder of the Serb guerrilla positions and he and his men resisted fiercely. With hundreds of Ottoman soldiers pouring into the trench, Sinđelić saw that his Brigade had little hope of staving off the Ottoman offensive. Hand-to-hand combat ensued in the trenches. Sinđelić decided to fire his flintlock pistol into a pile of gunpowder kegs. When the Ottomans swarmed the trench from all sides and headed for him, Sinđelić squeezed the trigger. The Serbs who remained in the trench with Sinđelić, as well as the attacking Ottomans, were all caught in the enormous explosion and perished. According to legend his famous last words were: &quot;Save yourselves brothers, who wants and who can! Those who stay will die!&quot;. The fall of Sinđelić&#x27;s trench forced the other units of the Serbian Revolutionary Army to retreat back to the town of Deligrad, where they entrenched themselves in a new, fortified front line.

It is estimated that over 6,000 Ottoman troops were killed during the explosion along with the surviving Serb revolutionaries (those who did not manage to escape the explosion, including Sinđelić).

Some 3,000 revolutionaries and all of the Ottoman troops that were present were killed in the Battle of Čegar at Čegar Hill. The Ottomans, following orders given by Hurşid Paşa of Niš, erected the famous Skull Tower (Ćele-Kula) on the road to Constantinople, containing 952 Serbian revolutionaries&#x27; skulls, as a warning to the Serbs and other Balkan peoples about any future dissent. Today, 57 skulls remain embedded into the walls of the Skull Tower in Niš.
