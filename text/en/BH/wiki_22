<text>Robert Gérard Goulet (November 26, 1933 October 30, 2007) was an American and Canadian singer and actor of French-Canadian ancestry. Goulet was born and raised in Lawrence, Massachusetts, until age 13, and then spent his formative years in Canada. 

Cast as Sir Lancelot and originating the role in the 1960 Broadway musical &quot;Camelot&quot; starring opposite established Broadway stars Richard Burton and Julie Andrews, he achieved instant recognition with his performance and interpretation of the song &quot;If Ever I Would Leave You&quot;, which became his signature song. His debut in &quot;Camelot&quot; marked the beginning of a stage, screen, and recording career. A Grammy Award winner, his career spanned almost six decades. 

Goulet starred in a 1966 television version of Brigadoon, a production which won five primetime Emmy Awards. In 1968, he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for &quot;The Happy Time&quot;, a musical about a French-Canadian family set in Ottawa. He gained recognition for his performance as Billy Bigelow in an abridged 1967 network television version of the musical &quot;Carousel&quot;. He later returned to Broadway in 1993 as King Arthur in a revival of &quot;Camelot&quot;.

==Early life==
Goulet was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, on Haverhill Street, where he also lived. He was the only son of Jeanette (née Gauthier) and Joseph Georges André Goulet. Both of his parents worked in the mills, but his father was also an amateur singer and wrestler. His parents were French Canadian, and he was a descendant of French-Canadian pioneers Zacharie Cloutier and Jacques Goulet. Shortly after his father&#x27;s death, 13-year-old Goulet moved with his mother and sister Claire to Girouxville, Alberta, where his uncle and other relatives lived, and he spent his formative years in Canada.

After living in Girouxville for several years, they moved to the provincial capital of Edmonton to take advantage of the performance opportunities offered in the city. There, he attended the voice schools founded by Herbert G. Turner and Jean Létourneau, and later became a radio announcer for radio station CKUA. Upon graduating from Victoria Composite high school (now Victoria School of the Arts), Goulet received a scholarship to The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, where he studied voice with oratorio baritones George Lambert and Ernesto Vinci. Goulet performed in opera productions with other Conservatory vocal students, including Jon Vickers and James Milligan.

In 1952, he competed in CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Pick The Stars&quot;, ultimately making the semifinals. This led to other network appearances on shows like &quot;Singing Stars of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;, &quot;Juliette&quot;, and the Canadian version of &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; in which he starred as Trapper Pierre opposite William Shatner. From 1957 to 1959 he co-hosted the CBC Television program &quot;Showcase&quot; with Joyce Sullivan.

==Career==
Goulet&#x27;s first U.S. bookings were in summer stock theatre with the Kenley Players. He appeared in eight productions, including &quot;Pajama Game&quot; (1959), &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1959), &quot;Dream Girl&quot; (1959), &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1960), &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1960) and &quot;Carousel&quot; (1960). John Kenley came to his dressing room after the opening of &quot;Pajama Game&quot; and gave him a raise, saying it was &quot;because he knew he could never afford to again&quot;, Goulet said in 2006. &quot;He was right.&quot; Goulet repeated his role in &quot;South Pacific&quot; for Kenley in a 1995 production.

In 1959, Goulet was introduced to librettist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe, who were having difficulty casting the role of Lancelot in their stage production &quot;Camelot&quot;. Lerner and Loewe, impressed by Goulet&#x27;s talent, signed the virtual newcomer to play the part, opposite Richard Burton (King Arthur) and Julie Andrews (Queen Guenevere). &quot;Camelot&quot; opened in Toronto in October 1960. It then played a four-week engagement in Boston, and finally opened on Broadway two months later. Goulet received favorable reviews, most notably for his show-stopping romantic ballad, &quot;If Ever I Would Leave You&quot; which would become his signature song.

Goulet&#x27;s first film performance was the animated musical feature &quot;Gay Purr-ee&quot; (1962), in which he provided the voice of the male lead character, &#x27;Jaune Tom&#x27;, opposite the female lead character, &#x27;Mewsette&#x27;, voiced by Judy Garland. Goulet began a recording career with Columbia Records in 1962, which resulted in more than 60 best selling albums. His first non-singing film role was in &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot; (1964), co-starring Jill St. John.

On May 25, 1965, Goulet mangled the lyrics to the U.S. national anthem at the opening of the second Muhammad Ali–Sonny Liston heavyweight championship fight in Lewiston, Maine in front of the smallest crowd in a heavyweight championship: 2500. It was actually the last fight for Cassius Clay before he chose the name Muhammad Ali. It was supposed to have been held in Boston but there was a mix-up and Lewiston was a last minute site replacement. Goulet had never sung the U.S. anthem in public before; the only anthem that he had ever done publicly was &quot;O Canada&quot;. Goulet replaced the lyric &quot;dawn&#x27;s early light&quot; with &quot;dawn&#x27;s early night&quot; and also fervently intoned &quot;&quot;gave proof through the fight&quot;.&quot; The fans booed, while Howard Cosell chortled thinking it good fun and all part of the spectacle. Now there was something to talk about besides the strange fight that ended in the first round with what has become known in the history books as the &quot;phantom punch&quot;. The gaffes were reported in newspapers nationwide the next morning, and Goulet was criticized in opinion columns for a lack of knowledge of the lyrics. As Dorothy Kilgallen had predicted on Goulet&#x27;s appearance on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; a few days before, the anthem lasted longer than the fight, which was over early in the first round. Goulet had his biggest pop hit that year, when his single &quot;My Love, Forgive Me&quot; reached No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 22 in Canada.

In 1966, Goulet starred in the television series &quot;Blue Light&quot;, in which he played a journalist working undercover in Nazi Germany as a spy on behalf of the Allies. The series ran for 17 episodes between January 12, 1966, and May 18, 1966. In December, a theatrical film starring Goulet, &quot;I Deal in Danger&quot;, was released, made up of the first four episodes of &quot;Blue Light&quot; edited together.

He also starred in an award-winning 1966 television version of &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, which won five primetime Emmy Awards, &quot;Carousel&quot; in 1967, and &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; in 1968, opposite his then-wife Carol Lawrence. All three were produced by Goulet&#x27;s company Rogo Productions and aired on ABC, but none have been rebroadcast since the 1960s or released on video. All three were recorded on videotape rather than film.

Goulet guest starred on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; in 1967 as himself and two additional characters who entered a Robert Goulet look-alike contest. In 1968, Goulet was back on Broadway in the Kander and Ebb musical &quot;The Happy Time&quot;. He won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his role. John Serry Sr. collaborated as the orchestral accordionist. In 1972, he played a lead villain in the season finale of television original &quot;&quot;. In 1978, he sang &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; at the Miss Universe Pageant to the five finalists. Goulet was featured in a two-part episode of the sitcom &quot;Alice&quot; during the 1981 season, again playing himself. The plot involves Mel (Vic Tayback) and the girls winning a free trip to Las Vegas, and while there, losing his diner in a gambling spree. Alice (Linda Lavin) plans to impersonate Goulet in an effort to persuade the casino owner to return the diner to Mel. The real Goulet appears and sings a duet with the (much shorter) fake Robert Goulet portrayed by Alice.

Goulet made a cameo appearance as himself in Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Atlantic City&quot; (1980). The movie was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. He recorded the song &quot;Atlantic City (My Old Friend)&quot; for Applause Records in 1981.
In 1988, Tim Burton cast him as a houseguest blown through the roof by &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and also played himself in Bill Murray&#x27;s &quot;Scrooged&quot; (both 1988). He performed the Canadian national anthem to open &quot;WrestleMania VI&quot; at SkyDome in Toronto in 1990. Goulet also made several appearances on the ABC sitcom &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot; during its five-year run.

In 1991, Goulet starred, with John Putch and Hillary Bailey Smith, in the unsold television series pilot &quot;Acting Sheriff&quot;. That same year, he appeared as Quentin Hapsburg, opposite Priscilla Presley and Leslie Nielsen, in the comedy film &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot;. This followed a cameo as a &quot;Special Guest Star&quot; in the episode &quot;The Butler Did It (A Bird in the Hand)&quot; of the 1982 TV series &quot;Police Squad!&quot; in which he died by firing squad during the opening credits. The television series spawned &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; film series.

In 1992, Goulet made an uncredited appearance as the piano player who suffers agonizing injuries in the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic video for &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot;. That same year, Goulet guest-starred as country music singer Eddie Larren in an episode of the TV series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;When the Music Stopped&quot;.

He starred as King Arthur in &quot;Camelot&quot; in a 1992 National Tour and returned to Broadway in 1993 with the same production. In 1993, he played himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;$pringfield&quot;. In that episode, Bart Simpson booked him into his own casino (actually Bart&#x27;s treehouse), where he sang &quot;Jingle Bells (Batman Smells)&quot;.

In 1995 he appeared fronting a big band in a small sports themed nightclub, for a series of humorous 30-second ESPN ads revolving around NCAA basketball. NCAA head coaches appeared in the audience as Goulet happily, not to mention strongly and authoritatively, sang variations on popular songs, with lyrics changed to include college basketball references. He appeared in the commercials for two seasons before ending the run in 1996.

In 1996, Goulet appeared in Ellen DeGeneres&#x27; first starring movie, &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot;, as an insecure TV host; and he returned to Broadway in &quot;Moon Over Buffalo&quot;, co-starring Lynn Redgrave. He provided the singing voice of Wheezy the penguin in the big band-style finale of the 1999 Pixar film &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, singing a new version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot;. In 2000, he played himself on two episodes of the Robert Smigel series &quot;TV Funhouse&quot;; as a sort-of mentor to the show&#x27;s animal puppet troupe, he was the only character who had the respect of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. Goulet also appeared in the Disney animated series &quot;Recess&quot;, as the singing voice for Mikey Blumberg, and in the film &quot;&quot;.

Goulet played Don Quixote in the 1997–98 U.S. national tour of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; and recorded the theme song for the talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in 2003. His commercial work included a 30-second spot for the 1998 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, showing him in different costumes (toll collector, construction worker, meter maid, etc.), all while singing &quot;&quot;It&#x27;s Impossible&quot;&quot;; and an Emerald Nuts television advertising campaign in 2006, which debuted during Super Bowl XL and continued until his death.

In 2005, he appeared on the Broadway stage for the last time as a mid-run replacement in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; and found critical success once again. Clive Barnes of &quot;The New York Post&quot; wrote of his performance:Goulet&#x27;s still radiant grin is in better shape than his joints, giving his movements rather less grace than before. But when he sings, or even speaks, the years fall away. His gorgeous voice seems untouched by time, and his dapper presence fills the stage... With Robert Goulet&#x27;s new, expansively embracing Georges, Beach seems revitalized, appearing to find a passion and pathos in the role previously eluding him. In 2006, he appeared in an episode (&quot;Sold&#x27;y Locks&quot;) of &quot;The King of Queens&quot; as himself. In 2007, Goulet received the Voice Education Research Awareness (VERA) Award from The Voice Foundation.

His last public performance was on the PBS televised special, &quot;My Music: 50&#x27;s Pop Parade&quot;, broadcast on August 1, 2007, in which he sang &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot; and &quot;If Ever I Would Leave You&quot;.

==Personal life==

Goulet and his first wife Louise Longmore had one daughter, Nicolette (died April 17, 2008), who gave birth to his two grandchildren, Solange-Louise and Jordan Gerard. He had two sons, Christopher (b. 1964) and Michael (b. 1966), by his second wife, actress and singer Carol Lawrence.

In 1982, he married artist and writer Vera Novak. Novak, who was born in Bitola, Yugoslavia, was also his business partner and manager. He sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; on Friday, August 8, 2003, when she was sworn in as a citizen of the United States in Las Vegas. Goulet and his wife Vera resided in Las Vegas and Los Angeles.

In 2006, he received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, and was inducted together with Alex Trebek and Paul Shaffer. At the induction ceremony, accompanied by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Goulet mentioned to the Prime Minister, a fellow Albertan, &quot;This is great, but what I really want is my Canadian citizenship.&quot; Goulet, who owned residential property in Montreal, had always believed that he was a Canadian citizen until late in life when he was informed otherwise. Goulet then applied for official Canadian citizenship, which was approved by the Canadian government, and became officially registered shortly after his death.

==Death==
On September 30, 2007, Goulet was hospitalized in Las Vegas, where he was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a rare but rapidly progressive and potentially fatal condition. On October 13 he was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after it was determined he would not survive without an emergency lung transplant. While awaiting a lung transplant, Goulet died from pulmonary fibrosis on the morning of October 30 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at the age of 73. Theater marquees in New York and in cities across North America were dimmed in his memory the following day. On November 9, the day of his funeral, Las Vegas honored Goulet by closing the Las Vegas Strip for his funeral procession. Several venues also posted his name on their marquees as a final tribute.

==Legacy==
In the early 2000s, Goulet was often subject to parody in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skits in which he was portrayed by comedian Will Ferrell. In one segment Will Ferrell, portraying Goulet, performed several songs from a farce compilation album titled &quot;Coconut Bangers Ball: It&#x27;s A Rap!&quot; Ferrell performed &quot;Big Poppa&quot; by The Notorious B.I.G., as well as the &quot;Thong Song&quot; by Sisqo, in a mock crooning style similar to that of Goulet.

Ferrell portrayed Goulet on the April 7, 2001 episode of &quot;SNL&quot; in a lengthy sketch opposite fellow cast member Chris Parnell and host Alec Baldwin. A cult favorite, the sketch is ostensibly a commercial for a stage production of a new musical titled &quot;Red Ships of Spain&quot; in which Robert Goulet (Ferrell) is appearing in the leading role of Captain Ferdinand Poncho. Parnell and Baldwin portray Goulet&#x27;s (fictitious) brothers Wes and Ken Goulet, respectively, who have supporting roles in the production. Ana Gasteyer also appears as Robert&#x27;s (fictitious) daughter Sheila Goulet, who is oddly cast as her father&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest.

He is also known for singing the theme song for the talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, which he recorded in 2003.

The musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; included a reference to him in &quot;Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love&quot;.

The American Mustache Institute presents The Robert Goulet Memorial Mustached American of the Year Award to the person who best represents or contributes to the Mustached American community during that year.

Journalist Scott Simon, host of &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot; on NPR, said in 2007:A professional entertainer doesn&#x27;t give any less of himself just because the audience gets a little smaller. What Robert Goulet taught us ... is that people who&#x27;ve been up and down are more interesting than people who are on their way up and think that&#x27;s the only direction life has. ... He worked hard; he made people happy.

In 2016, Goulet was portrayed by Broadway star Matt Bogart in episode 4 of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Vinyl&quot; as an act for American Century.

Nathanael West was born Nathan Weinstein in New York City, the first child of Ashkenazi Jewish parents Max (Morduch) Weinstein (1878–1932) and Anuta (Anna, née Wallenstein, 1878–1935), from Kovno, Russia (present-day Kaunas, Lithuania), who maintained an upper middle class household in a Jewish neighborhood on the Upper West Side. West displayed little ambition in academics, dropping out of high school and only gaining admission into Tufts College by forging his high school transcript.

After being expelled from Tufts, West got into Brown University by appropriating the transcript of a fellow Tufts student, his cousin, Nathan Weinstein. Although West did little schoolwork at Brown, he read extensively. He ignored the realist fiction of his American contemporaries in favor of French surrealists and British and Irish poets of the 1890s, in particular Oscar Wilde. West&#x27;s interests emphasized unusual literary style as well as unusual content. He became interested in Christianity and mysticism as experienced or expressed through literature and art.

West&#x27;s friends at Camp Paradox, a summer camp in Adirondack, New York, nicknamed him Pep in ironic reference to his somnolent disposition.
West acknowledged and made fun of his lack of physical prowess in recounting the story of a baseball game where he cost his team the game. Wells Root, a close friend of West, remembers hearing this tale half a dozen times, recalling that everyone had placed bets on the game, which came down to the final inning with the score tied and the enemy at bat with two outs. At that point the batter hit a long fly towards West;
He put his hands up to catch it and for some inexplicable reason didn&#x27;t hold them close together. The ball tore through, hit him in the forehead, and bounced into some brush. There was a roar from the crowd and [West] took one look and turned tail. To a man, the crowd had risen, gathered bats, sticks, stones, and anything they could lay hands on and were in hot pursuit. He vanished into some woods and didn&#x27;t emerge until nightfall. In telling the story he was convinced that if they had caught him they would have killed him.
It is unclear whether this ever happened, but West later re-imagined this in his short story &quot;Western Union Boy&quot;. As Jewish students were not allowed to join most fraternities, his main friend was his future brother-in-law S.J. Perelman. (Perelman married West&#x27;s sister Laura.) West barely finished at Brown with a degree. He then went to Paris for three months, and it was at this time that he changed his name to Nathanael West. His family, who had supported him thus far, ran into financial difficulties during the late 1920s. West returned home and worked sporadically in construction for his father, eventually finding a job as the night manager of the Hotel Kenmore Hall on East 23rd Street in Manhattan. One of West&#x27;s experiences at the hotel inspired the incident between Romola Martin and Homer Simpson that appeared in his novel &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1939).

In 1933 he was employed as the manager of the Sutton Hotel in New York City, located at 330 E. 56th Street.

==Author==
Although West had been working on his writing since college, it was not until his quiet night job at the hotel that he found the time to put his novel together. It was then that he wrote what became &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; (1933). Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent in 1933. In 1931, however, two years before he completed &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, West published &quot;The Dream Life of Balso Snell&quot;, a novel that he started in college. By then, West was within a group of writers working in and around New York City that included William Carlos Williams and Dashiell Hammett.

In 1933, West bought a farm in eastern Pennsylvania, but he soon got a job as a contract scriptwriter for Columbia Pictures and moved to Hollywood. He published a &quot;A Cool Million&quot; in 1934. None of West&#x27;s three works sold well, earning him less than $800, so he spent the mid-1930s in financial difficulty, sporadically collaborating on screenplays. Many of the films he worked on were B movies, such as &quot;Five Came Back&quot; (1939). It was at this time that he wrote &quot;The Day of the Locust.&quot; He took many of the settings and minor characters of his novel directly from his experience living in a hotel on Hollywood Boulevard.

In November 1939, West was hired as a screenwriter by RKO Radio Pictures, where he collaborated with Boris Ingster on a film adaptation of the novel &quot;Before the Fact&quot; (1932) by Francis Iles. West and Ingster wrote the screenplay in seven weeks, with West focusing on characterization and dialogue and Ingster focusing on the narrative structure.

RKO assigned the film, eventually released as &quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941), to Alfred Hitchcock; but Hitchcock already had his own, substantially different, screenplay. Hitchcock&#x27;s screenplay was written by Samson Raphaelson, Joan Harrison (Hitchcock&#x27;s secretary), and Alma Reville (Hitchcock&#x27;s wife). West and Ingster&#x27;s screenplay was abandoned, but the text can be found in the Library of America&#x27;s edition of West&#x27;s collected works.

==Death==
On December 22, 1940, West and his wife Eileen McKenney were returning to Los Angeles from a hunting trip in Mexico. West ran a stop sign in El Centro, California, resulting in a collision in which he and McKenney were killed. (Their deaths occurred the day after that of their friend F. Scott Fitzgerald.) McKenney had been the inspiration for the title character in the Broadway play &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, and she and West had been scheduled to fly to New York City for the Broadway opening on December 26.

West was buried in Mount Zion Cemetery in Queens, New York, with his wife&#x27;s ashes placed in his coffin.

==His work==
Although West was not widely known during his life, his reputation grew after his death, especially with the publication of his collected novels by New Directions in 1957. &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; is widely regarded as West&#x27;s masterpiece. &quot;Day of the Locust&quot; was made into a film which came out in 1975. Likewise &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; (1933) saw production in film (1933, 1958, 1983), stage (1957), and operatic (2006) versions; and the character &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot; in Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Rear Window&quot; has parallels to West&#x27;s work.

The obscene, garish landscapes of &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; gained force in light of the fact that the remainder of the country was living in drab poverty at the time. Though West attended socialist rallies in New York City&#x27;s Union Square, his novels have no affinity to the novels of his contemporary activist writers such as John Steinbeck and John Dos Passos. West&#x27;s writing style does not allow the portrayal of positive political causes, as he admitted in a letter to Malcolm Cowley regarding &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;: &quot;I tried to describe a meeting of the anti-Nazi league, but it didn&#x27;t fit and I had to substitute a whorehouse and a dirty film&quot;.

West saw the American dream as having been betrayed, both spiritually and materially, and in his writing he presented &quot;a sweeping rejection of political causes, religious faith, artistic redemption and romantic love&quot;. This idea of the corrupt American dream endured long after his death, in the form of the term &quot;West&#x27;s disease&quot;, coined by the poet W.H. Auden to refer to poverty that exists in both a spiritual and economic sense. Jay Martin wrote an extensive biography of West in 1970. Another biography, &quot;Lonelyhearts: The Screwball World of Nathanael West and Eileen McKenney&quot;, by Marion Meade was published in 2010.

<text>Applied psychology is the use of psychological methods and findings of scientific psychology to solve practical problems of human and animal behavior and experience. Educational and organizational psychology, business management, law, health, product design, ergonomics, behavioural psychology, psychology of motivation, psychoanalysis, neuropsychology, psychiatry and mental health are just a few of the areas that have been influenced by the application of psychological principles and scientific findings. Some of the areas of applied psychology include counseling psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, engineering psychology, occupational health psychology, legal psychology, school psychology, sports psychology, community psychology, neuropsychology, medical psychology and clinical psychology, evolutionary psychology, human factors, forensic psychology and traffic psychology. In addition, a number of specialized areas in the general area of psychology have applied branches (e.g., applied social psychology, applied cognitive psychology). However, the lines between sub-branch specializations and major applied psychology categories are often mixed or in some cases blurred. 

For example, a human factors psychologist might use a cognitive psychology theory. This could be described as human factor psychology or as applied cognitive psychology. When applied psychology is used in the treatment of behavioral disorders there are many experimental approaches to try and treat an individual. This type of psychology can be found in many of the subbranches in other fields of psychology.

== History ==

The founder of applied psychology was Hugo Münsterberg. He came to America (Harvard) from Germany (Berlin, Laboratory of Stern), invited by William James, and, like many aspiring psychologists during the late 19th century, originally studied philosophy. Münsterberg had many interests in the field of psychology such as purposive psychology, social psychology and forensic psychology. Hugo Münsterberg is credited with being one of the first people who has researched the field of applied psychology. He went to the University of Leipzig in Germany and attained his doctorate in Medicine. He opened the second psychology clinic in Germany in 1891 where he has continued his research. In 1907 he wrote several magazine articles concerning legal aspects of testimony, confessions and courtroom procedures, which eventually developed into his book, &quot;On the Witness Stand&quot;. The following year the Division of Applied Psychology was adjoined to the Harvard Psychological Laboratory. Within 9 years he had contributed eight books in English, applying psychology to education, industrial efficiency, business and teaching. Eventually Hugo Münsterberg and his contributions would define him as the creator of applied psychology. In 1920, the International Association of Applied Psychology (IAAP) was founded, as the first international scholarly society within the field of psychology.

Most professional psychologists in the U.S. worked in an academic setting until World War II. But during the war, the armed forces and the Office of Strategic Services hired psychologists in droves to work on issues such as troop morale and propaganda design. After the war, psychologists found an expanding range of jobs outside of the academy. Since 1970, the number of college graduates with degrees in psychology has more than doubled, from 33,679 to 76,671 in 2002. The annual numbers of masters&#x27; and PhD degrees have also increased dramatically over the same period. All the while, degrees in the related fields of economics, sociology, and political science have remained constant.

Professional organizations have organized special events and meetings to promote the idea of applied psychology. In 1990, the American Psychological Society held a Behavioral Science Summit and formed the &quot;Human Capital Initiative&quot;, spanning schools, workplace productivity, drugs, violence, and community health. The American Psychological Association declared 2000–2010 the Decade of Behavior, with a similarly broad scope. Psychological methods are considered applicable to all aspects of human life and society.

== Uses ==
There are many uses of applied psychology and can be found as a subfield in other genres of psychology. Applied Psychology has been used in teaching psychology because it focuses on the scientific findings and how it can be used to transfer that behavior.  Many people who use applied psychology work in the fields of teaching, industrial, clinical, and consulting work areas. The Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology delves deeper into the many subsections that are used in correlation with this field and further explains the procedures that should be used in each of the respective industries.

== Advertising ==
Business advertisers have long consulted psychologists in assessing what types of messages will most effectively induce a person to buy a particular product. The three main types of psychologists that participate in creating advertisements are cognitive, media, and social psychologists. These psychologists often work together to create advertisements that create an emotional impact on the viewer in order to make the advertisement more memorable. Using the psychological research methods and the findings in human&#x27;s cognition, motivation, attitudes and decision making, those can help to design more persuasive advertisement. Their research includes the study of unconscious influences and brand loyalty. However, the effect of unconscious influences was controversial. The use of these psychologists often create successful advertisements with the scientific methods that are used to portray violence, humor and sex.

==Educational==

Educational psychology is devoted to the study of how humans learn in educational settings, especially schools. Psychologists assess the effects of specific educational interventions: e.g., phonics versus whole language instruction in early reading attainment. They also study the question of why learning occurs differently in different situations.

Another domain of educational psychology is the psychology of teaching. In some colleges, educational psychology courses are called &quot;the psychology of learning and teaching&quot;. Educational psychology derives a great deal from basic-science disciplines within psychology including cognitive science and behaviorially-oriented research on learning.

==Counseling==

Counseling psychology is an applied specialization within psychology, that involves both research and practice in a number of different areas or domains. According to Gelso and Fretz (2001), there are some central unifying themes among counseling psychologists. These include a focus on an individual&#x27;s strengths, relationships, their educational and career development, as well as a focus on normal personalities. Counseling psychologists help people improve their well-being, reduce and manage stress, and improve overall functioning in their lives. The interventions used by Counseling Psychologists may be either brief or long-term in duration. Often they are problem focused and goal-directed. There is a guiding philosophy which places a value on individual differences and an emphasis on &quot;prevention, development, and adjustment across the life-span.&quot; The use of applied psychology in counseling is one of the most useful when it comes to the treatment of individuals. The use of knowledge from scientific findings are beneficial because there are many different options that can be tested to find the right treatment.

==Medical and clinical==
=== Medical psychology ===

Medical psychology involves the application of a range of psychological principles, theories and findings applied to the effective management of physical and mental disorders to improve the psychological and physical health of the patient. The American Psychological Association defines medical psychology as the branch of psychology that integrates somatic and psychotherapeutic modalities, into the management of mental illness, health rehabilitation and emotional, cognitive, behavioural and substance use disorders. According to Muse and Moore (2012), the medical psychologist&#x27;s contributions in the areas of psychopharmacology which sets it apart from other of psychotherapy and psychotherapists.
=== Clinical psychology ===

Clinical psychology includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy, although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury—this area is known as clinical neuropsychology. In many countries clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession.

The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be done inside various therapy models, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. The four major perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential-humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate these various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding ethnicity, gender, spirituality, and sexual-orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is growing evidence that most of the major therapies are about of equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance. Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation.

Clinical psychologists do not usually prescribe medication, although there is a growing number of psychologists who do have prescribing privileges, in the field of medical psychology. In general, however, when medication is warranted many psychologists will work in cooperation with psychiatrists so that clients get therapeutic needs met. Clinical psychologists may also work as part of a team with other professionals, such as social workers and nutritionists.

==Environmental==

Environmental psychology is the psychological study of humans and their interactions with their environments. The types of environments studied are limitless, ranging from homes, offices, classrooms, factories, nature, and so on. However, across these different environments, there are several common themes of study that emerge within each one. Noise level and ambient temperature are clearly present in all environments and often subjects of discussion for environmental psychologists. Crowding and stressors are a few other aspects of environments studied by this sub-discipline of psychology. When examining a particular environment, environmental psychology looks at the goals and purposes of the people in the using the environment, and tries to determine how well the environment is suiting the needs of the people using it. For example, a quiet environment is necessary for a classroom of students taking a test, but would not be needed or expected on a farm full of animals. The concepts and trends learned through environmental psychology can be used when setting up or rearranging spaces so that the space will best perform its intended function. The top common, more well known areas of psychology that drive this applied field include: cognitive, perception, learning, and social psychology.

==Forensic, legal and criminal==

Forensic psychology and legal psychology are the areas concerned with the application of psychological methods and principles to legal questions and issues. Most typically, forensic psychology involves a clinical analysis of a particular individual and an assessment of some specific psycho-legal question. The psycho-legal question does not have to be criminal in nature. Forensic psychologists rarely get involved in the actual criminal investigations, which falls under a broader category of applied psychology called criminal psychology. Custody cases are an example of non-criminal evaluations by forensic psychologists. The validity and upholding of eyewitness testimony is an area of forensic psychology that does veer closer to criminal investigations, though does not directly involve the psychologist in the investigation process. Psychologists are often called to testify as expert witnesses on issues such as the accuracy of memory, the reliability of police interrogation, and the appropriate course of action in child custody cases.

Legal psychology refers to any application of psychological principles, methods or understanding to legal questions or issues. In addition to the applied practices, legal psychology also includes academic or empirical research on topics involving the relationship of law to human mental processes and behavior. However, inherent differences that arise when placing psychology in the legal context. Psychology rarely makes absolute statements. Instead, psychologists traffic in the terms like level of confidence, percentages, and significance. Legal matters, on the other hand, look for absolutes: guilty or not guilty. This makes for a sticky union between psychology and the legal system. Some universities operate dual JD/PhD programs focusing on the intersection of these two areas.

The Committee on Legal Issues of the American Psychological Association is known to file &quot;amicus curae&quot; briefs, as applications of psychological knowledge to high-profile court cases.

A related field, police psychology, involves consultation with police departments and participation in police training.

== Health and medicine ==

Health psychology concerns itself with understanding how biology, behavior, and social context influence health and illness. Health psychologists generally work alongside other medical professionals in clinical settings, although many also teach and conduct research. Although its early beginnings can be traced to the kindred field of clinical psychology, four different approaches to health psychology have been defined: clinical, public health, community and critical health psychology.

Health psychologists aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens. The focus of health psychologists tend to center on the health crisis facing the western world particularly in the US. Cognitive behavioral therapy and behavior modification are techniques often employed by health psychologists. Psychologists also study patients&#x27; compliance with their doctors&#x27; orders.

Health psychologists view a person&#x27;s mental condition as heavily related to their physical condition. An important concept in this field is stress, a mental phenomenon with well-known consequences for physical health.

=== Occupational health psychology ===

Occupational health psychology (OHP) is a relatively new discipline that emerged from the confluence of health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and occupational health. OHP has its own journals and professional organizations. The field is concerned with identifying psychosocial characteristics of workplaces that give rise to health-related problems in people who work. These problems can involve physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disease) or mental health (e.g., depression). Examples of psychosocial characteristics of workplaces that OHP has investigated include amount of decision latitude a worker can exercise and the supportiveness of supervisors. OHP is also concerned with the development and implementation of interventions that can prevent or ameliorate work-related health problems. In addition, OHP research has important implications for the economic success of organizations. Other research areas of concern to OHP include workplace incivility and violence, work-home carryover, unemployment and downsizing, and workplace safety and accident prevention. Two important OHP journals are the &quot;Journal of Occupational Health Psychology&quot; and &quot;Work &amp; Stress&quot;. Three important organizations closely associated with OHP are the International Commission on Occupational Health&#x27;s Scientific Committee on Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS), the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, and the European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology.

==Human factors and ergonomics==

Human factors and ergonomics is the study of how cognitive and psychological processes affect our interaction with tools, machines, and objects in the environment. Many branches of psychology attempt to create models of and understand human behavior. These models are usually based on data collected from experiments. Human Factor psychologists however, take the same data and use it to design or adapt processes and objects that will complement the human component of the equation. Rather than humans learning how to use and manipulate a piece of technology, human factors strives to design technology to be inline with the human behavior models designed by general psychology. This could be accounting for physical limitations of humans, as in ergonomics, or designing systems, especially computer systems, that work intuitively with humans, as does engineering psychology.

Ergonomics is applied primarily through office work and the transportation industry. Psychologists here take into account the physical limitations of the human body and attempt to reduce fatigue and stress by designing products and systems that work within the natural limitations of the human body. From simple things like the size of buttons and design of office chairs to layout of airplane cockpits, human factor psychologists, specializing in ergonomics, attempt to de-stress our everyday lives and sometimes even save them.

Human factor psychologists specializing in engineering psychology tend to take on slightly different projects than their ergonomic centered counterparts. These psychologists look at how a human and a process interact. Often engineering psychology may be centered on computers. However at the base level, a process is simply a series of inputs and outputs between a human and a machine. The human must have a clear method to input data and be able to easily access the information in output. The inability of rapid and accurate corrections can sometimes lead to drastic consequences, as summed up by many stories in Set Phasers on Stun. The engineering psychologists wants to make the process of inputs and outputs as intuitive as possible for the user.

The goal of research in human factors is to understand the limitations and biases of human mental processes and behavior, and design items and systems that will interact accordingly with the limitations. Some may see human factors as intuitive or a list of dos and don&#x27;ts, but in reality, human factor research strives to make sense of large piles of data to bring precise applications to product designs and systems to help people work more naturally, intuitively with the items of their surroundings.

==Industrial and organizational==

Industrial and organizational psychology, or I-O psychology, focuses on the psychology of work. Relevant topics within I-O psychology include the psychology of recruitment, selecting employees from an applicant pool, training, performance appraisal, job satisfaction, work motivation. work behavior, occupational stress, accident prevention, occupational safety and health, management, retirement planning and unemployment among many other issues related to the workplace and people&#x27;s work lives. In short, I-O psychology is the application of psychology to the workplace. One aspect of this field is job analysis, the detailed study of which behaviors a given job entails.

Though the name of the title &quot;Industrial Organizational Psychology&quot; implies 2 split disciplines being chained together, it is near impossible to have one half without the other. If asked to generally define the differences, Industrial psychology focuses more on the Human Resources aspects of the field, and Organizational psychology focuses more on the personal interactions of the employees. When applying these principles however, they are not easily broken apart. For example, when developing requirements for a new job position, the recruiters are looking for an applicant with strong communication skills in multiple areas. The developing of the position requirements falls under the industrial psychology, human resource type work, and the requirement of communication skills is related to how the employee with interacts with co-workers. As seen here, it is hard to separate task of developing a qualifications list from the types of qualifications on the list. This is parallel to how the I and O are nearly inseparable in practice. Therefore, I-O psychologists are generally rounded in both industrial and organizational psychology though they will have some specialization. Other topics of interest for I-O psychologists include leadership, performance evaluation, training, and much more.

Military psychology includes research into the classification, training, and performance of soldiers.

==School==

School psychology is a field that applies principles of clinical psychology and educational psychology to the diagnosis and treatment of students&#x27; behavioral and learning problems. School psychologists are educated in child and adolescent development, learning theories, psychological and psycho-educational assessment, personality theories, therapeutic interventions, special education, psychology, consultation, child and adolescent psychopathology, and the ethical, legal and administrative codes of their profession.

According to Division 16 (Division of School Psychology) of the American Psychological Association (APA), school psychologists operate according to a scientific framework. They work to promote effectiveness and efficiency in the field. School psychologists conduct psychological assessments, provide brief interventions, and develop or help develop prevention programs. Additionally, they evaluate services with special focus on developmental processes of children within the school system, and other systems, such as families. School psychologists consult with teachers, parents, and school personnel about learning, behavioral, social, and emotional problems. They may teach lessons on parenting skills (like school counselors), learning strategies, and other skills related to school mental health. In addition, they explain test results to parents and students. They provide individual, group, and in some cases family counseling (State Board of Education 2003; National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education, n.d.). School psychologists are actively involved in district and school crisis intervention teams. They also supervise graduate students in school psychology. School psychologists in many districts provide professional development to teachers and other school personnel on topics such as positive behavior intervention plans and achievement tests.

One salient application for school psychology in today&#x27;s world is responding to the unique challenges of increasingly multicultural classrooms. For example, psychologists can contribute insight about the differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures.

School psychologists are influential within the school system and are frequently consulted to solve problems. Practitioners should be able to provide consultation and collaborate with other members of the educational community and confidently make decisions based on empirical research.

== Social change ==
Psychologists have been employed to promote &quot;green&quot; behavior, i.e. sustainable development. In this case, their goal is behavior modification, through strategies such as social marketing. Tactics include education, disseminating information, organizing social movements, passing laws, and altering taxes to influence decisions.

Psychology has been applied on a world scale with the aim of population control. For example, one strategy towards television programming combines social models in a soap opera with informational messages during advertising time. This strategy successfully increased women&#x27;s enrollment at family planning clinics in Mexico. The programming—which has been deployed around the world by Population Communications International and the Population Media Center—combines family planning messages with representations of female education and literacy.

==Sport psychology==

Sport psychology is a specialization within psychology that seeks to understand psychological/mental factors that affect performance in sports, physical activity and exercise and apply these to enhance individual and team performance. The sport psychology approach differs from the coaches and players perspective. Coaches tend to narrow their focus and energy towards the end-goal. They are concerned with the actions that lead to the win, as opposed to the sport psychologist who tries to focus the players thoughts on just achieving the win. Sport psychology trains players mentally to prepare them, whereas coaches tend to focus mostly on physical training. Sport psychology deals with increasing performance by managing emotions and minimizing the psychological effects of injury and poor performance. Some of the most important skills taught are goal setting, relaxation, visualization, self-talk awareness and control, concentration, using rituals, attribution training, and periodization. The principles and theories may be applied to any human movement or performance tasks (e.g., playing a musical instrument, acting in a play, public speaking, motor skills). Usually, experts recommend that students be trained in both kinesiology (i.e., sport and exercise sciences, physical education) and counseling.

==Traffic psychology==

Traffic psychology is an applied discipline within psychology that looks at the relationship between psychological processes and cognitions and the actual behavior of road users. In general, traffic psychologists attempt to apply these principles and research findings, in order to provide solutions to problems such as traffic mobility and congestion, road accidents, speeding. Research psychologists also are involved with the education and the motivation of road users.

<text>Jacques-Charles Dupont de l&#x27;Eure (; 27 February 17673 March 1855) was a French lawyer and statesman.

He is best known as the first head of state of the Second Republic, after the collapse of the July Monarchy as a result of the French Revolution of 1848.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Born in Le Neubourg, Normandy, he was a lawyer at the &quot;parlement&quot; of Normandy when the French Revolution began. During the First Republic and the First Empire, he filled successive judicial offices at Louviers, Rouen and Évreux. He had adopted revolutionary principles, and in 1798 began his political life as a member of the French Directory&#x27;s Council of Five Hundred.

In 1813 he became a member of the &quot;Corps législatif&quot; and, during the Hundred Days, was vice-president of the chamber of deputies. When the Seventh Coalition armies entered Paris, he drew up the declaration asserting the necessity of maintaining the principles of government that had been established at the Revolution. He was chosen as one of the commissioners to negotiate with the Coalition sovereigns.

===Prominence===
From 1817 until 1849 (through the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy) he was, without interruption, a member of the chamber of deputies, and he acted consistently with the Liberal opposition, of which he was the virtual leader. For a few months in 1830 he held office as Minister of Justice, but, finding himself out of harmony with his colleagues, resigned before the end of the year and resumed his place in the opposition.

===Second Republic===

When the 1848 Revolution began, Dupont de l&#x27;Eure was made President of the provisional assembly, being its oldest member. On the same day, he was made President of the Provisional Government, becoming France&#x27;s de facto Head of State. He can therefore be considered as France&#x27;s first Presidential Head of State, though Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, later in the same year, was the first to formally bear the title of President of the French Republic. His prestige and popularity prevented the heterogeneous republican coalition from having to immediately agree upon a common leader. Due to his great age (upon entering office, he was just a few days short of his 81st birthday), Dupont de l&#x27;Eure effectively delegated part of his duties to Minister of Foreign Affairs Alphonse de Lamartine. On 4 May, he resigned in order to make way for the Executive Commission, which he declined to join. He supported Louis-Eugène Cavaignac against Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. In 1849, having failed to secure his re-election to the chamber, he retired from public life.

His consistency in defending the cause of constitutional liberalism throughout the many changes of his times gained him the respect of many of his countrymen, who referred to Dupont de l&#x27;Eure as &quot;Aristides of the French tribune&quot;.

<doc id="326324" wikidata="Q3115646" url="?curid=326324" title="Scientific consensus on climate change">
<text>There is a nearly unanimous scientific consensus that the Earth has been consistently warming since the start of the Industrial Revolution, that the rate of recent warming is largely unprecedented, and that this warming is mainly the result of a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) caused by human activities. The human activities causing this warming include fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and land use changes such as deforestation, with a significant supporting role from the other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. This human role in climate change is considered &quot;unequivocal&quot; and &quot;incontrovertible&quot;.

Nearly all actively publishing climate scientists say humans are causing climate change. Surveys of the scientific literature are another way to measure scientific consensus. A 2019 review of scientific papers found the consensus on the cause of climate change to be at 100%, and a 2021 study concluded that over 99% of scientific papers agree on the human cause of climate change. The small percentage of papers that disagreed with the consensus often contained errors or could not be replicated.

The evidence for global warming due to human influence has been recognized by the national science academies of all the major industrialized countries. In the scientific literature, there is a very strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view. A few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions, and some have tried to persuade the public that climate change is not happening, or if the climate is changing it is not because of human influence, attempting to sow doubt in the scientific consensus. 

== Existence of a scientific consensus ==
Studies of the scientific opinion on climate change have been undertaken since the 1970s, and they have been establishing widespread consensus since the 1990s, with the level of agreement increasing over time. Individual scientists, universities, and laboratories contribute to the scientific opinion on climate change via their peer-reviewed publications, while the scientific bodies of national or international standing summarise the areas of collective agreement and relative certainty in synthesis reports.

Examples of such reports include or the 2004 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment from the International Arctic Science Committee and the governments of the Arctic Council, or the United States&#x27; National Climate Assessment, which has been released periodically since 2000 under the auspices of the United States Global Change Research Program. The fourth NCA, released in 2017, involved the efforts of thirteen federal agencies, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and around &quot;1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government.&quot;

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had been formed by the United Nations in 1988, and it presents reports summarizing the strength and extent of consensus on climate change and its numerous aspects to the member states of the United Nations, with the major reports released at 5-to-7-year intervals starting from 1990.

In 2001, science academies from 17 countries (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sweden, Trinidad, Turkey and the United Kingdom) made a joint statement endorsing the work of IPCC. They concurred that the temperatures are rising and will continue to rise due to human activities, and also stressed the importance of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, concluding that &quot;Business as usual is no longer a viable option&quot;. It is also notable for being one of the first statements to explicitly use the term &quot;consensus&quot;. In 2005, another joint statement from the science academies of major countries (Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States referred to the conclusions of the IPCC as &quot;the international scientific consensus&quot;, and urged prompt action on both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. Elsewhere around the world, other organizations to have referred to the scientific consensus include Network of African Science Academies in 2007, and the International Union for Quaternary Research in 2008.

In 2013, a study which found that out of over 4,000 peer-reviewed papers on climate science published since 1990, 97% agree, explicitly or implicitly, that global warming is happening and is human-caused. Surveys of scientists&#x27; views on climate change – with a focus on human caused climate change – have been undertaken since the 1970s. A 2016 reanalysis confirmed that &quot;the finding of 97% consensus [that humans are causing recent global warming] in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.&quot; A 2019 study found scientific consensus to be at 100%, and a 2021 study found that consensus exceeded 99%.

==Consensus points==

The scientific consensus regarding causes and mechanisms of climate change, its effects and what should be done about it (climate action) is that:

* It is &quot;unequivocal&quot; and &quot;incontrovertible&quot; that the greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have caused warming on land, in oceans and in the troposphere. There are no natural processes which can provide an alternate explanation.
* The atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are the highest they have been in at least 2 million years, if not 3.2 million years. The atmospheric levels of two other major greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide, are the highest they have been in at least the past 800,000 years. The record of the past 800,000 years also shows that the increases in their concentrations seen since 1750 would take millennia to be caused by natural processes.
* The decade of 2010s has been warmer than the late 19th century, and the warmest since the start of a consistent instrumental temperature record. The warming of the past 50 years has occurred faster than any other warming over the past 2,000 years, if not longer.
* Precipitation appears to have been increasing since 1950, but the rainfall patterns have also been shifting, and there is more evidence for increases in heavy precipitation which causes flash floods.
* Global sea level has increased by since 1900, with half of that increase occurring since 1980. This sea level rise has been the fastest in &quot;at least the last 3000 years&quot;, which is very likely to have been caused by human activity.
* As the recent warming heats the ocean, its water expands in volume. This causes half of the recent sea level rise, with the rest due to the warming melting the ice sheets and glaciers.
* While there have always been severe and extreme weather events (e.g. tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, tornados, droughts, heat waves, precipitation extremes), climate change has made many of them more severe, more frequent, or more likely to co-occur, in every part of the globe.
* The dangers of extreme weather events will continue increasing unless there is a rapid decrease in greenhouse gas emissions needed to curb further warming.
* Increased warming will lead to worse impacts.
* The extent of human-caused emissions will be the main cause of future warming.

== Statements by major scientific organizations about climate change ==

Many of the major scientific organizations about climate change have issued formal statements of opinion. The vast majority of these statements concur with the IPCC view, some very few are non-committal, or dissent from it. The California Governor&#x27;s Office website lists nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations who hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action.

==Surveys of scientists&#x27; views on climate change==
===1970s===

In 1978, the National Defense University of the United States had surveyed 24 experts about the near-term climate change and its effects on agriculture. The majority of respondents had expected some warming to occur between 1970 and 2000, and described human emissions of carbon dioxide as the primary cause, but there was a disagreement on the extent, and a few had thought that an increase in volcanic activity would offset carbon dioxide emissions by elevating atmospheric sulfate concentrations (which have a reflective effect, also associated with global dimming, and with some solar geoengineering proposals) and result in overall cooling. When NDU had combined their predictions, they estimated a 10% likelihood of large (~) cooling occurring by 2000, a 25% likelihood of smaller cooling around , a 30% likelihood of limited change, with around warming, a 25% likelihood of &quot;moderate&quot; warming of ~, and a 10% likelihood of large warming of around . Subsequently, about had occurred between 1950 and 2000, with about since 1970, largely matching the survey&#x27;s &quot;moderate global warming&quot; scenario.

===1980s===
In 1989, David H. Slade had surveyed 21 climate scientists, of whom 17 had expressed &quot;a strong belief&quot; in &quot;the reality of a significant climate change&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
In March 1990, Cutter Information Corporation (now known as Cutter Consortium) sent questionnaires to 1500 researchers who were on the attendance lists of climate change conferences, and received 331 responses from 41 countries. The survey revealed widespread agreement that global warming is already happening, that it will result in negative impacts such as sea level rise, and that reducing carbon dioxide emissions and halting deforestation is an appropriate response to it. Only 1.9% of respondents predicted that there would be an overall cooling across the next 100 years. There was more disagreement on the strength of future warming: i.e. around 30% believed that there was a less than 50% chance that the warming would reach or exceed over the next 100 years, while a larger fraction (almost 40%) thought such temperatures were at least 75% likely.

In 1991, the Center for Science, Technology, and Media sent a survey of 6 questions to around 4000 ocean and atmospheric scientists from 45 countries, and received 118 responses by January 1992, with 91% from North America. Out of those 118 scientists, 73 have either agreed or &quot;strongly&quot; agreed with the statement &quot;There is little doubt among scientists that global mean temperature will increase&quot;, while 27 had disagreed and only 9 had &quot;strongly disagreed&quot;, with the remaining 9 &quot;neutral&quot;. 58 scientists had agreed that the effects of climate change are expected to be &quot;substantial&quot; by the scientific community as a whole, with 36 disagreeing and 21 staying neutral. Finally, when asked about the 1990 IPCC estimate of warming proceeding at per decade throughout the 21st century under the business-as-usual climate change scenario, 13 (15%) expressed skepticism, 39 (44%) had emphasized uncertainty, and 37 (42%) had agreed. 52% thought the rate of warming would likely be lower, and 8% thought it would be higher. As of 2023, the rate of warming had been or less.

In 1996, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, a pair of researchers at the Helmholtz Research Centre&#x27;s Institute for Coastal Research, sent a questionnaire over mail to 1000 climate scientists in Germany, the United States and Canada. 40% responded, and the results subsequently published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society in 1999. On a scale of 1 out of 7, where &quot;higher&quot; numbers indicated greater &quot;disagreement&quot;, &quot;global warming is already underway&quot; had a mean rating of 3.4, and &quot;global warming will occur in the future&quot; had an even greater agreement of 2.6 Surveyed scientists had less confidence in the accuracy of contemporary climate models, rating their ability to make &quot;reasonable predictions&quot; 10 years out at 4.8, and 5.2 for 100-year predictions: however, they consistently rejected the notion that there was too much uncertainty to justify taking immediate action, with a mean 5.6 out of 7 rating. In fact, they usually agreed there was substantial uncertainty about how strongly the impacts will affect society, and that many changes would likely be necessary to adapt.

=== 2000–2004 ===
In 2003, Bray and von Storch repeated their 1996 survey, using the same response structure with ratings on a 1–7 scale, and including all of the original questions. Further, new questions were added, which were devoted to climate change adaptation and media coverage of climate change. This second survey received 530 responses from 27 different countries, but it has been strongly criticized on the grounds that it was performed on the web with no means to verify that the respondents were climate scientists or to prevent multiple submissions. While the survey required entry of a username and password, its critics alleged that both were circulated to non-scientists, including to a climate change denial mailing list. Bray and von Storch defended their results, claiming that a statistical analysis with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and a Wald–Wolfowitz runs test revealed no significant irregularities.

In general, the second survey had demonstrated an increase in scientific confidence relative to the first. One of the greatest increases was for the statement &quot;We can say for certain that global warming is a process already underway&quot;, where 1 represented strong agreement and 7 strong disagreement: the mean response went from 3.39 to 2.41. In response to the question, &quot;To what extent do you agree or disagree that climate change is mostly the result of anthropogenic causes?&quot;, it went from 4.17 to 3.62. Notably, the percentage of respondents &quot;strongly disagreeing&quot; stayed the same, at 10%, and a similar percentage stayed neutral (14% in 1996 and 13% in 2003): yet, the overall split went from 41% agreement and 45% disagreement in 1996 to 56% agreement and 30% disagreement in 2003, as there was both a substantial increase in agreement and a decline percentage of those disagreeing less strongly. Similarly, there was a 72% to 20% split in favour of describing the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that &quot;there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions.&quot;

In 2004, the geologist and historian of science Naomi Oreskes analyzed the abstracts of 928 scientific papers on &quot;global climate change&quot; published between 1993 and 2003. 75% had either explicitly expressed support for the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, or had accepted it as a given and were focused on evaluating its impacts or proposing approaches for climate change mitigation, while the remaining 25% were devoted to methods of current climate change research or paleoclimate analysis. No abstract had explicitly rejected the scientific consensus.

=== 2005–2009 ===

In 2007, Harris Interactive surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the American Meteorological Society or the American Geophysical Union for the Statistical Assessment Service (STATS) at George Mason University, publishing the results in April 2008. 97% of the scientists surveyed agreed that global temperatures had increased during the past 100 years, and only 5% believed that human activity does not contribute to greenhouse warming. 84% said they personally believed human-induced warming was occurring, and 74% agreed that &quot;currently available scientific evidence&quot; substantiated its occurrence. 56% described the study of global climate change as a mature science and 39% as an emerging science. When asked about the likely severity of effects of climate change over the next 50–100 years, 41% said they could be described as catastrophic; 44% thought the effects would be moderately dangerous while about 13% thought there was relatively little danger.

The third Bray and von Storch survey was also conducted in 2008, with the results published in 2010. It used the same methodology as their two previous surveys, with a similar number of sections and also asking to rate responses on a 1-to-7 scale (i.e. from &#x27;not at all&#x27; to &#x27;very much&#x27;), but it had also introduced web links with respondent-specific unique identifiers to eliminate multiple responses. 2058 climate scientists from 34 countries were surveyed, and a total of 373 responses were received (response rate of 18.2%).

To the question &quot;How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?&quot;, 67.1% said they very much agreed (7), 26.7% agreed to some large extent (6), 6.2% said to they agreed to some small extent (2–4), none said they did not agree at all. To the question &quot;How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?&quot; the responses were 34.6% very much agree, 48.9% agreeing to a large extent, 15.1% to a small extent, and 1.35% not agreeing at all. Similarly, 34.6% had very much agreed that climate change &quot;poses a very serious and dangerous threat to humanity&quot; and 27.6% agreed to a large extent, while only 1.1% did not agree at all.

At the same time, the respondents had strongly rejected the concept of intentionally presenting the most extreme possibilities in the hope of mobilizing the public, with around 73% disagreeing (1–3), 12.5% unsure and 14.5% agreeing in any way (5–7). Only 1.6% had agreed very much, while 27.2% did not agree at all, even as they overwhelmingly agreed (84% vs. 4%) that the scientists who do this are the most likely to be listened to by journalists. The respondents have generally expressed high confidence in the IPCC reports, with 63.5% agreeing that they estimated the impacts of temperature change exactly right (4 on the scale), and only 1.4% responding that they had strongly underestimated and 2.5% that they had strongly overestimated those impacts (1 and 7 on a scale.) On sea level rise, 51.4% thought the reports were exactly right, and only about 16% thought it was overestimated in any way (5–7), while the remaining third believed it was underestimated (1–3). Subsequent IPCC reports had been forced to regularly increase their estimates of future sea level rise, largely in response to newer research on the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica.

In 2009, Peter Doran and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman at University of Illinois at Chicago polled 10,257 earth scientists from various specialities and received replies from 3,146. 79 respondents were climatologists who had published over half of their peer-reviewed research on the subject of climate change, and 76 of them agreed that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels, with 75 describing human activity as a significant factor. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures have risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. Economic geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent, respectively, believing in significant human involvement. In summary, Doran and Zimmerman wrote:

=== 2010–2014 ===
A 2010 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America reviewed publication and citation data for 1,372 climate researchers, 908 of whom had authored 20 or more publications on climate, and found that

(i) 97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of ACC (Anthropogenic Climate Change) outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.
In October 2011, researchers from George Mason University analyzed the results of a survey of 998 actively working scientists from the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society, or listed in the 23rd edition of American Men and Women of Science, 489 of whom had returned completed questionnaires. 97% of respondents had agreed that global temperatures have risen over the past century. 84% agreed that &quot;human-induced greenhouse warming is now occurring,&quot; 5% disagreed, and 12% didn&#x27;t know. When asked what they regard as &quot;the likely effects of global climate change in the next 50 to 100 years,&quot; on a scale of 1 to 10, from Trivial to Catastrophic: 13% of respondents replied 1 to 3 (trivial/mild), 44% replied 4 to 7 (moderate), 41% replied 8 to 10 (severe/catastrophic), and 2% didn&#x27;t know.

In 2012, James L. Powell, a former member of the National Science Board, analyzed published research on global warming and climate change between 1991 and 2012 and found that of the 13,950 articles in peer-reviewed journals, only 24 (&lt;0.2%) rejected anthropogenic global warming. This was a follow-up to an analysis looking at 2,258 peer-reviewed articles published between November 2012 and December 2013, which revealed that only one of the 9,136 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.

Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch had conducted their fourth survey in 2013, publishing its results the following year. 283 scientists had responded: 185 (65.4%) had been working in climate science for over 15 years, and only 19 (6.7%) had 0 to 5 years of experience. It had the same methodology as the third survey, ranking responses on a 1-to-7 scale and similar responses to the same questions: i.e., when asked, &quot;How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?&quot;, 74.7% said they very much agreed (7), 2.9% were &quot;neutral&quot; (4), and only 2.1% were 1–3 on the scale. To the question &quot;How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?&quot;, 43% had very much agreed, 28.5% agreeing to a large extent (6), 16.6% to a small extent (2–4), and 2.5% did not agree at all (1). 41.8% had very much agreed that climate change &quot;poses a very serious and dangerous threat to humanity&quot; and 23.2% agreed to a large extent, while 3.5% did not agree at all. A new question asked respondents to attribute a &quot;percentage&quot; of recent warming to anthropogenic causes: 73.3% of scientists attributed 70–100%, while only 1.5% said there was zero human role.

In 2013, another scientist, John Cook, examined 11,944 abstracts from the peer-reviewed scientific literature from 1991 to 2011 that matched the topics &#x27;global climate change&#x27; or &#x27;global warming&#x27;. He and his co-authors found that, while 66.4% of them expressed no position on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), of those that did, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are contributing to global warming. They also invited authors to rate their own papers and found that, while 35.5% rated their paper as expressing no position on AGW (known to be expected in a consensus situation) 97.2% of the rest endorsed the consensus. In both cases the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position was marginally increasing over time. They concluded that the number of papers actually rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research, and that &quot;the fundamental science of AGW is no longer controversial among the publishing science community and the remaining debate in the field has moved on to other topics.&quot;

In 2014, researchers from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency surveyed 1,868 climate scientists. They found that, consistent with other research, the level of agreement on anthropogenic causation correlated with expertise – 90% of those surveyed with more than 10 peer-reviewed papers related to climate (just under half of survey respondents) explicitly agreed that greenhouse gases were the main cause of global warming. They included researchers on mitigation and adaptation in their surveys in addition to physical climate scientists, leading to a slightly lower level of consensus compared to previous studies.

=== 2015–2019 ===

A 2016 study titled &quot;Learning from mistakes in climate research&quot; followed up on John Cook&#x27;s 2013 paper by examining the quality of the 3% of peer-reviewed papers which had rejected the consensus view. They discovered that &quot;replication reveals a number of methodological flaws, and a pattern of common mistakes emerges that is not visible when looking at single isolated cases&quot;. That same year, Cook&#x27;s paper was criticized by Richard Tol, but strongly defended by a companion paper in the same volume.

The 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists by Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch took place over December 2015 and January 2016. Unlike the past surveys, the scientists were no longer questioned on their opinion of the IPCC, and there was much more focus on extreme event attribution. In other ways, it had replicated the methodology of the previous surveys, with most responses ranked on a 1-to-7 scale. There were over 600 complete responses: 291 (45.2%) had been working in climate science for over 15 years, while 79 (12.3%) had 0 to 5 years of experience. When asked &quot;How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?&quot;, 79.3% said they very much agreed (7), 1.2% were &quot;neutral&quot; (4), and only 2.1% were 1–3 on the scale. To the question &quot;How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?&quot;, 47.7% had very much agreed, 26% agreeing to a large extent (6), 9.8% to a small extent (2–4), and 1.9% did not agree at all (1). 46% had very much agreed that climate change &quot;poses a very serious and dangerous threat to humanity&quot; and 26% agreed to a large extent, while 2.2% did not agree at all. 75.8% said that the level of uncertainty in climate science had decreased since 1996, while 13.6% said it had increased. 75.7% said that the level of risk associated with climate change had increased considerably since 1996, while 5% said it had decreased.

In 2017, James L. Powell analyzed five surveys of the peer-reviewed literature from 1991 to 2015, and found that they amounted to a combined 54,195 articles, few of which had outright rejected anthropogenic climate change, resulting in an average consensus of 99.94%. In November 2019, his survey of over 11,600 peer-reviewed articles published in the first seven months of 2019 showed that the consensus had reached 100%.

=== 2020s ===

In 2021, Krista Myers led a paper which surveyed 2780 Earth scientists. Depending on expertise, between 91% (all scientists) to 100% (climate scientists with high levels of expertise, 20+ papers published) agreed human activity is causing climate change. Among the total group of climate scientists, 98.7% agreed. The agreement was lowest among scientists who chose Economic Geology as one of their fields of research (84%).

Also in 2021, a team led by Mark Lynas had found 80,000 climate-related studies published between 2012 and 2020, and chose to analyse a random subset of 3000. Four of these were skeptical of the human cause of climate change, 845 were endorsing the human cause perspective at different levels, and 1869 were indifferent to the question. The authors estimated the proportion of papers not skeptical of the human cause as 99.85% (95% confidence limit 99.62%–99.96%). Excluding papers which took no position on the human cause led to an estimate of the proportion of consensus papers as 99.53% (95% confidence limit 98.80%–99.87%). They confirmed their numbers by explicitly looking for alternative hypotheses in the entire dataset, which resulted in 28 papers.

<text>Andrew James Viterbi (born Andrea Giacomo Viterbi, March 9, 1935) is an electrical engineer and businessman who co-founded Qualcomm Inc. and invented the Viterbi algorithm. He is the Presidential Chair Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Viterbi School of Engineering, which was named in his honor in 2004 in recognition of his $52 million gift.

==Early life==
Viterbi was born to an Italian family in Bergamo, Italy and emigrated with them to the United States two years before World War II. His original name was Andrea, but when he was naturalized in the US, his parents anglicized it to Andrew.

== Education ==
Viterbi attended the Boston Latin School, and then entered Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1952, studying electrical engineering. He received both BS and MS in electrical engineering in 1957 from MIT. He was elected to membership in the honor society Eta Kappa Nu in 1956 through the MIT chapter.

He worked at Raytheon and later at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, where he started working on telemetry for uncrewed space missions, also helping to develop the phase-locked loop. Simultaneously, he was carrying out PhD studies at the University of Southern California, where he graduated in 1963 in digital communications.

== Career ==

After receiving his PhD, he applied successfully for an academic position at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

Viterbi was later a professor of electrical engineering at UCLA and University of California, San Diego (UCSD). In 1967 he proposed the Viterbi algorithm to decode convolutionally encoded data. It is still used widely in cellular phones for error correcting codes, as well as for speech recognition, DNA analysis, and many other applications of Hidden Markov models. On advice of a lawyer, Viterbi did not patent the algorithm.
Viterbi also helped to develop the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) standard for cell phone networks.

Viterbi was the cofounder of Linkabit Corporation, with Irwin M. Jacobs in 1968, a small telecommunications contractor. He was also the co-founder of Qualcomm Inc. with Jacobs in 1985. , he is the president of the venture capital company The Viterbi Group. He continues to be involved in wireless communications technology companies as a strategic advisor to Ingenu&#x27;s board of directors.

Virterbi was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1978. In 1998 he was one of the few receiving a Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society. Viterbi earned it for &quot;the invention of the Viterbi algorithm&quot;. He was inducted into the Wireless Hall of Fame, in 2000, for his dedication to the cellular industry. In 2002, Viterbi dedicated the Andrew Viterbi &#x27;52 Computer Center at his alma mater, Boston Latin School. On March 2, 2004, the University of Southern California School of Engineering was renamed the Viterbi School of Engineering in his honor, following his $52 million donation to the school. He is a member of the USC board of trustees.
He is also on the Board of Trustees at The Scripps Research Institute.

He is also founding member of ISSNAF (The Italian Scientists and Scholars in North America Foundation).

In 2005, he was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering.

In 2006, he was made an Eminent Member of Eta Kappa Nu.

Viterbi and Irwin M. Jacobs received the 2007 IEEE/RSE Wolfson James Clerk Maxwell Award, for &quot;fundamental contributions, innovation, and leadership that enabled the growth of wireless telecommunications&quot;.

In 2008, he was named a Millennium Technology Prize finalist for the invention of the Viterbi algorithm. At the award ceremony in Finland on June 11, 2008, he was awarded a prize of EUR 115,000 and the prize trophy &quot;Peak&quot; as a 2008 Millennium Technology Laureate.

In September 2008, he was awarded the National Medal of Science for developing &quot;the &#x27;Viterbi algorithm&#x27;, and for his contributions to Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless technology that transformed the theory and practice of digital communications&quot;.

In 2010, he received the IEEE Medal of Honor and in the same year he also received the IIC Lifetime Achievement Award by the Italian Cultural Institute of Los Angeles. In 2011, he received the John Fritz Medal from the American Association of Engineering Societies.

In 2013, Viterbi was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

In 2017, Viterbi, along with Irwin Jacobs, received the IEEE Milestone Award for their CDMA and spread spectrum development that drives the mobile industry.

==Viterbi&#x27;s problem on the coincidence of PLL ranges==
A. Viterbi analytically showed that for the first-order PLL model (filterless model) the three main ranges (hold-in, pull-in, lock-in ranges) coincide. Various conjectures (e.g., Egan&#x27;s conjecture on the pull-in range of type II APLL) and estimates of the ranges of higher-order PLL models appeared based on this result, which led to the problem of determining the regions of the physical parameters of the PLL (parameters of the phase detector, filter, and voltage-controlled oscillator) where the ranges coincide. In the framework of mathematical control theory, this result is a development of the ideas of the possibility of determining the global behavior of a nonlinear system via linear analysis and various well-known conjectures on global stability (Kalman&#x27;s conjecture and others) for a cylindrical phase space.

==Personal life==
Viterbi was married to Erna Finci (1934–2015), who was a Jewish refugee from Sarajevo in the former Yugoslavia. Erna was a Holocaust survivor. In 1941, during World War II, the Finci family fled German-occupied Yugoslavia for the Italian-occupied zone from which they were deported and interned in the Parma region of Italy. In 1943, when the Nazis occupied Italy, the family was saved from deportation to extermination camps by the people of Gramignazzo di Sissa, the village where they had been interned; they were cared for by the local Ponghellini family, who hid them in their vineyard when German forces advanced into Italy. Other Italians helped them escape to Switzerland, walking across the Alps, where they waited out the war.
They had three children, Alan Viterbi, Audrey Viterbi, and Alexander Viterbi (who died in 2011 at age 40). Alan served on the inaugural West Hollywood city council in 1984 when the city was incorporated, and served as the city&#x27;s mayor in 1988. Audrey served as an assistant professor at UC Irvine.

<text>August Schleicher (; 19 February 1821 – 6 December 1868) was a German linguist. Schleicher studied the Proto-Indo-European language and devised theories concerning historical linguistics. His great work was &quot;A Compendium of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-European Languages&quot; in which he attempted to reconstruct the Proto-Indo-European language. To show how Indo-European might have looked, he created a short tale, Schleicher&#x27;s fable, to exemplify the reconstructed vocabulary and aspects of Indo-European society inferred from it.

== Life ==
Schleicher was born in Meiningen, in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, southwest of Weimar in the Thuringian Forest. He died from tuberculosis at the age of 47 in Jena, in the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, in present-day Thuringia.

== Career ==
Schleicher was educated at the University of Tübingen and Bonn and taught at the Charles University in Prague and the University of Jena. He began his career studying theology and Oriental languages, especially Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit and Persian. Combining influences from the seemingly opposed camps of scientific materialism and the idealist philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, he developed the theory that a language is an organism, with periods of development, maturity and senescence. Languages begin relatively simply. The state of primitive simplicity is followed by a period of growth and increased complexity, which eventually slows and results in a period of decay (1874:4):

: As man has developed, so also has his language (...): even the simplest language is the product of a gradual growth: all higher forms of language have come out of simpler ones... Language declines both in sound and in form... The transition from the first to the second period is one of slower progress.
In 1850, Schleicher completed a monograph systematically describing European languages, &quot;Die Sprachen Europas in systematischer Uebersicht (The Languages of Europe in Systematic Perspective)&quot;. He explicitly represented languages as natural organisms that could most conveniently be described using terms drawn from biology – genus, species, and variety – and arranged languages into a &quot;Stammbaum&quot; (family tree). He first introduced a graphic representation of a &quot;Stammbaum&quot; in an article published in 1853 entitled &quot;Die ersten Spaltungen des indogermanischen Urvolkes&quot;. By the time of the publication of his &quot;Deutsche Sprache (German language)&quot; (1860) he had begun to use tree diagrams to illustrate language development. Schleicher is commonly recognized as the first linguist to portray language evolution using the figure of a &quot;tree&quot;. Largely in reaction, Johannes Schmidt later proposed his &#x27;Wave Theory&#x27; as an alternative model.

Schleicher is the author of the first scientific &quot;Compendium of Lithuanian language&quot;, which was published in German in 1856/57. Schleicher asserted that the Lithuanian language can compete with the Greek and Roman (Old Latin) languages in perfection of forms.

Schleicher was an advocate of the polygenesis of languages. He reasoned as follows (1876:2):

: To assume one original universal language is impossible; there are rather many original languages: this is a certain result obtained by the comparative treatment of the languages of the world which have lived till now. Since languages are continually dying out, whilst no new ones practically arise, there must have been originally many more languages than at present. The number of original languages was therefore certainly far larger than has been supposed from the still-existing languages.

Schleicher&#x27;s ideas on polygenesis had long-lasting influence, both directly and via their adoption by the biologist Ernst Haeckel. Ernst Haeckel was a German evolutionist and zoologist known for proposing the gastraea hypothesis.

In 1866, August Leskien, a pioneer of research into sound laws, began studying comparative linguistics as a student of August Schleicher at the University of Jena.

==Linguistic theories==
===Tree model===
Schleicher helped popularize the tree model (also Stammbaum, genetic, or cladistic model) of historical linguistics, a model of the evolution of languages analogous to the concept of a family tree diagram, particularly a phylogenetic tree of the biological evolution of species. As with species, each language is assumed to have evolved from a single parent language, with languages that share a common ancestor belonging to the same language family. 

The tree model has been a common method of describing genetic relationships between languages since the first attempts to do so. It is important for comparative linguistics, which involves using evidence from known languages and observed rules of linguistic evolution to identify and describe the hypothetical proto-languages ancestral to each language family, such as Proto-Indo-European and the Indo-European languages. However, this is largely a theoretical, qualitative pursuit, and linguists have always emphasized the inherent limitations of the tree model due to the large role played by geographic diffusion (&quot;horizontal transmission&quot;) in language evolution, ranging from loanwords to patois languages that have multiple parent languages. The wave model was developed in 1872 by Schleicher&#x27;s student Johannes Schmidt as an alternative to the tree model that incorporates geographic diffusion.

The tree model also has the same limitations as biological taxonomy with respect to the species problem of quantizing a continuous phenomenon that includes exceptions like ring species in biology and dialect continua in language. The concept of a linguistic linkage was developed in response and refers to a group of languages that evolved from a dialect continuum rather than from linguistically isolated child languages of a single language.

===Comparative method===
In linguistics, the comparative method is a technique for studying the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages with common descent from a shared ancestor and then extrapolating backwards to infer the properties of that ancestor. The comparative method may be contrasted with the method of internal reconstruction in which the internal development of a single language is inferred by the analysis of features within that language. Ordinarily, both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages; to provide information missing about the historical record of a language; to discover the development of phonological, morphological and other linguistic systems and to confirm or to refute hypothesised relationships between languages. The comparative method was developed during the 19th century. Major contributions were made by the Danish scholars Rasmus Rask and Karl Verner and the German scholar Jacob Grimm.

The first linguist to offer reconstructed forms from a proto-language was Schleicher, in his &quot;Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen&quot;, originally published in 1861. Here is Schleicher&#x27;s explanation of why he offered reconstructed forms:

In the present work an attempt is made to set forth the inferred Indo-European original language side by side with its really existent derived languages. Besides the advantages offered by such a plan, in setting immediately before the eyes of the student the final results of the investigation in a more concrete form, and thereby rendering easier his insight into the nature of particular Indo-European languages, there is, I think, another of no less importance gained by it, namely that it shows the baselessness of the assumption that the non-Indian Indo-European languages were derived from Old-Indian (Sanskrit).
===Schleicher&#x27;s fable===
Schleicher&#x27;s fable is a text composed in a reconstructed version of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language, published by Schleicher in 1868. Schleicher was the first scholar to compose a text in PIE. The fable is entitled (&quot;The Sheep [Ewe] and the Horses [Eoh]&quot;). At later dates, various scholars have published revised versions of Schleicher&#x27;s fable, as the idea of what PIE should look like has changed over time. The fable may serve as an illustration of the significant changes that the reconstructed language has gone through during the last 150 years of scholarly efforts.

<text>Sir John Bowring , or Phrayā Siam Mānukūlakicca Siammitra Mahāyaśa (17 October 1792 – 23 November 1872) was a British political economist, traveller, writer, literary translator, polyglot and the fourth Governor of Hong Kong. He was appointed by Queen Victoria as emissary to Siam, later he was appointed by King Mongkut of Siam as ambassador to London, also making a treaty of amity with Siam on 18 April 1855, now referred to as the &quot;Bowring Treaty&quot;. His namesake treaty was fully effective for 70 years, until the reign of Vajiravudh. This treaty was gradually edited and became completely ineffective in 1938 under the government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram. Later, he was sent as a commissioner of Britain to the newly created Kingdom of Italy in 1861. He died in Claremont in Devon on 23 November 1872.

== Early life ==
Bowring was born in Exeter of Charles Bowring (1769–1856), a wool merchant whose main market was China, from an old Unitarian family, and Sarah Jane Anne (d. 1828), the daughter of Thomas Lane, vicar of St Ives, Cornwall. His last formal education was at a Unitarian school in Moretonhampstead and he started work in his father&#x27;s business at age 13. Bowring at one stage wished to become a Unitarian minister. Espousal of Unitarian faith was illegal in Britain until Bowring had turned 21.

Bowring acquired first experiences in trade as a contract provider to the British army during the Peninsular War in the early 1810s, initially for four years from 1811 as a clerk at Milford &amp; Co. where he began picking up a variety of languages. His experiences in Spain fed a healthy skepticism towards the administrative capabilities of the British military. He travelled extensively and was imprisoned in Boulogne-sur-Mer for six weeks in 1822 for suspected spying (though merely carrying papers for the Portuguese envoy to Paris).

He incorporated Bowring &amp; Co. with a partner in 1818 to sell herrings to Spain (including Gibraltar by a subsidiary) and France and to buy wine from Spain. It was during this period that he came to know Jeremy Bentham, and later became his friend. He did not, however, share Bentham&#x27;s contempt for &quot;belles lettres&quot;. He was a diligent student of literature and foreign languages, especially those of Eastern Europe. He somehow found time to write 88 hymns during this time, most published between 1823 and 1825.

Failure of his business in 1827, amidst his Greek revolution financing adventure, left him reliant on Bentham&#x27;s charity and seeking a new, literary direction. Bentham&#x27;s personal secretary at the time, John Neal, labelled Bowring a &quot;meddling, gossiping, sly, and treacherous man&quot; and charged him with deceiving investors in his Greek adventure and mismanaging Bentham&#x27;s funds for Bowring&#x27;s own prestige with the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; and an early public gymnasium.

== Political economist career ==
Bowring had begun contributing to the newly founded &quot;Westminster Review&quot; and had been appointed its editor by Bentham in 1825. By his contributions to the &quot;Review&quot; he attained considerable repute as a political economist and parliamentary reformer. He advocated in its pages the cause of free trade long before it was popularized by Richard Cobden and John Bright, co-founders of the Anti-Corn Law League in Manchester in 1838.

He pleaded earnestly on behalf of parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation, and popular education. Bentham failed in an attempt to have Bowring appointed professor of English or History at University College London in 1827 but, after Bowring visited the Netherlands in 1828, the University of Groningen conferred on him the degree of doctor of laws in February the next year for his &quot;Sketches of the Language and Literature of Holland.&quot; In 1830, he was in Denmark, preparing for the publication of a collection of Scandinavian poetry. As a member of the 1831 Royal Commission, he advocated strict parliamentary control on public expenditure, and considered the ensuing reform one of his main achievements. Till 1832, he was Foreign Secretary of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association.

Bowring was appointed Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s literary executor a week before the latter&#x27;s 1832 death in his arms, and was charged with the task of preparing a collected edition of his works. The appointment was challenged by a nephew but Bowring prevailed in court. The work appeared in eleven volumes in 1843, notably omitting Bentham&#x27;s most controversial works on female sexuality and homosexuality.

Free trade took on the dimensions of faith to Bowring who, in 1841, quipped, &quot;Jesus Christ is free trade and free trade is Jesus Christ&quot;, adding, in response to consternation at the proposition, that it was &quot;intimitely associated with religious truth and the exercise of religious principles&quot;.

== Politician industrialist ==
Through Bentham connections and in spite of his radicalism, Bowring was appointed to carry out investigations of the national accounting systems of the Netherlands and France in 1832 by the government and House of Commons, respectively. The mark left by his work in France was not welcomed by all; as one commentator remarked,

 Of all men, high or low, that I ever met in society, this Dr Bowring is the most presuming and the most conceited. He is a fit &quot;charlatan&quot;, for Whig employment; pushing and overbearing in his manner, and, like other &quot;parvenus&quot;, assuming an official importance which is highly ridiculous.

Yet his work was so highly regarded by the Whig government that he was then appointed secretary of the Royal Commission on the Public Accounts. He had made his name as something of an expert on government accounting. He stood the same year for the newly created industrial constituency of Blackburn but was unsuccessful.

In 1835, Bowring entered parliament as member for Kilmarnock Burghs; and in the following year he was appointed head of a government commission to be sent to France to inquire into the actual state of commerce between the two countries. After losing his seat in 1837, he was busied in further economic investigations in Egypt, for which he produced a very extensive report, as well as Syria, Switzerland, Italy, and some of the states in Imperial Germany. The results of these missions appeared in a series of reports laid before the House of Commons and even a paper delivered to the British Association of Science with his observations on containment of the plague in the Levant. He also spoke out passionately for equal rights for women and the abolition of slavery.
On a still narrow, landed constituency, Bowring, campaigning on a radical and, to Marx and Engels, inconsistent platform of free trade and Chartism, secured a seat in parliament in 1841, as member for Bolton, perhaps England&#x27;s constituency most affected by industrial upheaval and riven by deep social unrest bordering on revolution. In the House, he campaigned for free trade, adoption of the Charter, repeal of the Corn Laws, improved administration of the Poor Law, open borders, abolition of the death penalty, and an end to flogging in the Army and payments to Church of England prelates.

During this busy period he found leisure for literature, and published in 1843 a translation of the &quot;Manuscript of the Queen&#x27;s Court&quot;, a collection of Czech medieval poetry, later considered false by Czech poet Václav Hanka. In 1846 he became President of the Mazzinian People&#x27;s International League.

Without inherited wealth, or salary as MP for Bolton, Bowring sought to sustain his political career by investing heavily in the south Wales iron industry from 1843. Following huge demand for iron rails brought about by parliament&#x27;s approval of massive railway building from 1844 to 1846, Bowring led a small group of wealthy London merchants and bankers as Chairman of the Llynvi Iron Company and established a large integrated ironworks at Maesteg in Glamorgan during 1845–46. He installed his brother, Charles, as Resident Director and lost no time in naming the district around his ironworks, Bowrington. He gained a reputation in the Maesteg district as an enlightened employer, one contemporary commenting that &#x27;he gave the poor their rights and carried away their blessing&#x27;.

In 1845 he became Chairman of the London and Blackwall Railway, the world&#x27;s first steam-powered urban passenger railway and the precursor of the whole London Rail system.
Bowring distinguished himself as an advocate of decimal currency. On 27 April 1847, he addressed the House of Commons on the merits of decimalisation. He agreed to a compromise that directly led to the issue of the florin (one-tenth of a pound sterling), introduced as a first step in 1848, by way of pattern coins not issued for circulation, and in 1849 as a circulating coin known as the &#x27;Godless&#x27; Florin due to it omitting the words &#x27;DEI GRATIA&#x27; in the obverse legend. As the 1849 coins proved unpopular, the coins were redesigned accordingly and went into general production 3 years later in 1852 and became known as &#x27;Gothic Head&#x27; Florins remaining in production until 1887. He lost his seat in 1849 but went on to publish a work entitled &quot;The Decimal System in Numbers, Coins and Accounts&quot; in 1854.

The trade depression of the late 1840s caused the failure of his venture in south Wales in 1848 and wiped out his capital, forcing Bowring into paid employment. His business failure led directly to his acceptance of Palmerston&#x27;s offer of the consulship at Canton.

== Canton ==
By 1847, Bowring had assembled an impressive array of credentials: honorary diplomas from universities in Holland and Italy, fellowships of the Linnean Society of London and Paris, the Historical Institute of the Scandinavian and Icelandic Societies, the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, the Royal Society of Hungary, the Royal Society of Copenhagen, and of the Frisian and Athenian Societies. Numerous translations and works on foreign languages, politics and economy had been published. His zeal in Parliament and standing as a literary man were well known.

In 1849, he was appointed British consul at Canton (today&#x27;s Guangzhou), and superintendent of trade in China. Arriving on HMS &quot;Medea&quot; on 12 April 1849, he took up the post in which he was to remain for four years the next day. His son John Charles had preceded him to China, arriving in Hong Kong in 1842, had been appointed Justice of the Peace and was at one point a partner in Jardines.

Bowring was quickly appalled by endemic corruption and frustrated by finding himself powerless in the face of Chinese breaches of the Treaty of Nanking and refusal to receive him at the diplomatic level or permit him to travel to Peking, and by his being subordinate to the Governor of Hong Kong who knew nothing of his difficulties.

For almost a year from 1852 to 1853, he acted as Britain&#x27;s Plenipotentiary and Superintendent of Trade and Governor of Hong Kong in the absence on leave of Sir George Bonham, who he was later to succeed.

Bowring was instrumental in the 1855 formation of the Board of Inspectors established under the Qing Customs House, operated by the British to gather statistics on trade on behalf of the Qing government and, later, as the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs Service, to collect all customs duties. This was a vital reform which brought an end to the corruption of government officials and led modernisation of China&#x27;s international trade. Concerned for the welfare of coolies being exported to Australia, California, Cuba and the West Indies, and disturbed by the coolie revolt in Amoy in May 1852, Bowring tightened enforcement of the Passenger Act so as to improve coolie transportation conditions and ensure their voluntariness.

== Governor of Hong Kong ==

The newly knighted Bowring received his appointment as Governor of Hong Kong and her Majesty&#x27;s Plenipotentiary and Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China on 10 January 1854. He arrived in Hong Kong and was sworn in on 13 April 1854, in the midst of the Taiping Rebellion occupying the attentions of his primary protagonists and the Crimean War distracting his masters. He was appointed over strong objections from opponents in London. Fellow Unitarian Harriet Martineau had warned that Bowring was &quot;no fit representative of Government, and no safe guardian of British interests&quot;, that he was dangerous and would lead Britain into war with China, and that he should be recalled. Her pleas went unheeded.

Bowring was an extremely industrious reformist governor. He allowed the Chinese citizens in Hong Kong to serve as jurors in trials and become lawyers. He is credited with establishing Hong Kong&#x27;s first commercial public water supply system. He developed the eastern Wan Chai area at a river mouth near Happy Valley and Victoria Harbour by elongating the river as a canal, the area being named Bowring City (Bowrington). By instituting the Buildings and Nuisances Ordinance, No. 8 of 1856, in the face of stiff opposition, Bowring ensured the safer design of all future construction projects in the colony. He sought to abolish monopolies.

Bowring was impressed by the yawning gulf of misunderstanding between the expatriate and Chinese communities, writing, &quot;We rule them in ignorance and they submit in blindness.&quot; Notwithstanding, in 1856, Bowring went so far as to attempt democratic reform. He proposed that the constitution of the Legislative Council be changed to increase membership to 13 members, of whom five be elected by landowners enjoying rents exceeding 10 pounds, but this was rejected by Henry Labouchère of the Colonial Office on the basis that Chinese residents were &quot;deficient in the essential elements of morality on which social order rests&quot;. The constituency would only have amounted to 141 qualified electors, in any event.

He was equally impressed by the dearth of expenditure on education, noting that 70 times more was provided for policing than for instruction of the populace, so he rapidly brought in an inspectorate of schools, training for teachers and opening of schools. Student number increased nearly ten-fold.

He became embroiled in numerous conflicts and disputes, not least of which was a struggle for dominance with Lieutenant Governor William Caine, which went all the way back to the Colonial Office for resolution. He won. He was faulted for failing to prevent a scandalous action in slander, in 1856, by the assistant magistrate W. H. Mitchell against his attorney-general T. Chisholm Anstey over what was essentially a misapprehension of fact but which was thought &quot;unique in all the scandals of modern government of the Colonies or of English Course of Justice&quot;.

A Qing-sponsored campaign of civil disruption, threatening the very survival of the British administration, culminated in the Esing Bakery incident of 15 January 1857 in which 10 pounds of arsenic was mixed in the flour of the colony&#x27;s principal bakery, poisoning many hundreds, killing Bowring&#x27;s wife and debilitating him for at least a year. This was a turning point for Bowring who, cornered, all but abandoned his liberality in favour of sharply curtailed civil liberties. He bemoaned:

It is a perplexing position to know that a price is set on our heads, that our servants cannot be trusted, that a premium is offered to any incendiary who will set fire to our dwellings, to any murderer who will poison or destroy us. ... We have many grievances to redress, and I will try to redress them; many securities to obtain, and I mean to obtain them. ... many unfortunate wretches of all nations (as the hatred of the Chinese is indiscriminating) have been seized, decaptitated; and their heads have been exposed on the walls of Canton, their assailants having been largely rewarded; ... All this is sufficiently horrible ... we shall exact indemnities for the past, and obtain securities for the future. We shall not crouch before assassination and incendiarism ... I did all that depended upon me to promote conciliation and establish peace. ... but every effort I made was treated with scorn and repulsion. The forbearance with which the Chinese have been treated has been wholly misunderstood by them, and attributed to our apprehensions of their great power, and awe of the majesty of the &#x27;Son of Heaven&#x27;. So they have disregarded the most solemn engagements of treaties, and looked upon us as &#x27;barbarians,&#x27; ... I doubt not that Government, Parliament, and public opinion will go with us in this great struggle, ...

==Diplomacy==
In 1855, Bowring experienced a reception in Siam that could not have stood in starker contrast to Peking&#x27;s constant intransigence. He was welcomed like foreign royalty, showered with pomp (including a 21-gun salute), and his determination to forge a trade accord was met with the open-minded and intelligent interest of King Mongkut. Negotiations were buoyed by the cordiality between Mongkut and Bowring and an agreement was reached on 17 April 1855, now commonly referred to as the Bowring Treaty. Bowring held Mongkut in high regard and that the feeling was mutual and enduring was confirmed by his 1867 appointment as Siam&#x27;s ambassador to the courts of Europe. Bowring&#x27;s delight in this &quot;remarkable&quot; monarch has been seen by at least one commentator as a possible encouragement to his frustration with Peking and rash handling of the &quot;Arrow&quot; affair.

== War and late career ==
In October 1856, a dispute broke out with the Canton vice-consul Ye Mingchen over the Chinese crew of a small British-flagged trading vessel, the &quot;Arrow&quot;. Bowring saw the argument as an opportunity to wring from the Chinese the free access to Canton which had been promised in the Treaty of Nanking but so far denied. The irritation caused by his &quot;spirited&quot; or high-handed policy led to the Second Opium War (1856–1860). Martineau put the war down to the &quot;incompetence and self-seeking rashness of one vain man&quot;.

It was under Bowring that the colony&#x27;s first ever bilingual English-Chinese law, &quot;An Ordinance for licensing and regulating the sale of prepared opium&quot; (Ordinance No. 2 of 1858), appeared on its statute books.

In April the same year, Bowring was the subject of scandal when the case of criminal libel against the editor of the &quot;Daily Press&quot;, Yorick J. Murrow, came to trial. Murrow had written of Bowring&#x27;s having taken numerous steps to favour the trade of his son&#x27;s firm, Messrs Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co., enriching it as a result. Murrow, having been found guilty by the jury, emerged from six months&#x27; imprisonment to take up precisely where he left off, vilifying Bowring from his press. The scandal was rekindled in December when Murrow brought an ultimately unsuccessful suit in damages against Bowring in connection with his imprisonment.

A commission of inquiry into accusations of corruption, operating brothels and associating with leading underworld figures laid by Attorney-General Anstey against Registrar-General Daniel R Caldwell scandalised the administration. During the course of its proceedings Anstey had opportunity to viciously accuse William Thomas Bridges, one-time acting Attorney-General and constant favourite of Bowring, for receiving stolen goods under the guise of running a money-lending operation from the ground floor of his residence, collecting debts at extortionate rates. The charges found unproved, Caldwell was exonerated and Anstey suspended, and Bridges later to be appointed acting Colonial Secretary by Bowring, but suspicions remained and Bowring&#x27;s administration had been ruined.

In mourning for the recent loss of his wife to the arsenic poisoning, Bowring made an official tour of the Philippines, sailing on the steam-powered paddle frigate &quot;Magicienne&quot; on 29 November 1858, returning seven weeks later.

Stripped of his diplomatic and trade powers, weakened by the effects of the arsenic, and seeing his administration torn apart by anti-corruption inquiries in a campaign launched by him, Bowring&#x27;s work in Hong Kong ended in May 1859. His parting sentiment was that &quot;a year of great embarrassment ... unhappy misunderstandings among officials, fomented by passionate partisanship and by a reckless and slanderous press, made the conduct of public affairs one of extreme difficulty.&quot; He plunged into writing a 434-page account of his Philippines sojourn which was published the same year.

His last employment by the British government was as a commissioner to Italy in 1861, to report on British commercial relations with the new kingdom. Bowring subsequently accepted the appointment of minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary from the Hawaiian government to the courts of Europe, and in this capacity negotiated treaties with Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.

== Linguist and author ==
Bowring was an accomplished polyglot and claimed he knew 200 languages of which he could speak 100. Many of his contemporaries and subsequent biographers thought otherwise. His chief literary work was the translation of the folk-songs of most European nations, although he also wrote original poems and hymns, and books or pamphlets on political and economic subjects. The first fruits of his study of foreign literature appeared in &quot;Specimens of the Russian Poets&quot; (1821–1823). These were followed by &quot;Batavian Anthology&quot; (1824), &quot;Ancient Poetry and Romances of Spain&quot; (1824), &quot;Specimens of the Polish Poets&quot;, and &quot;Serbian Popular Poetry&quot;, both in 1827, and &quot;Poetry of the Magyars&quot; (1830).

Bowring&#x27;s 88 published hymns include &quot;God is love: his mercy brightens&quot;, &quot;In the Cross of Christ I glory&quot;, and &quot;Watchman, tell us of the night&quot;.
&quot;In the Cross&quot; and &quot;Watchman&quot;, both from his privately published collection &quot;Hymns&quot; (1825), are still used in many churches. The American composer Charles Ives used part of &quot;Watchman, Tell Us of the Night&quot; in the opening movement of his Fourth Symphony.

== Personal life ==
Bowring married twice. By his first wife, Maria (1793/94–1858), whom he married in 1818 after moving to London, he had five sons and four daughters (Maria, John, Frederick, Lewin, Edgar, Charles, Edith, Emily, and Gertrude). She died in September 1858, a victim of the arsenic poisoning of the bread supply in Hong Kong during the Second Opium War sparked by her husband.

*His son John Charles was a keen amateur entomologist, ultimately amassing a collection of some 230,000 specimens of coleoptera which he donated to the British Museum in 1866.
*His fourth son, Edgar Alfred Bowring, was a Member of Parliament for Exeter from 1868 to 1874. E. A. Bowring is also known as an able translator in the literary circles of the time.
*Lewin Bentham Bowring was a member of the Bengal Civil Service. He served as private secretary in India to Lord Canning and Lord Elgin, and later as commissioner of Mysore.
*His daughter, Emily, became a Roman Catholic nun and was known as Sister Emily Aloysia Bowring. She was the first headmistress of the Italian Convent School (now known as the Sacred Heart Canossian College) in Hong Kong, serving from 1860 until her death in 1870.

Bowring married his second wife, Deborah Castle (1816–1902), in 1860; they had no children. Deborah, Lady Bowring died in Exeter in July 1902. She was a prominent Unitarian Christian and supporter of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

John Bowring died on 23 November 1872, aged 80.

== Legacy ==
Bowring is credited with popularising Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Kubla Khan or a Vision in a Dream&quot; which had been disparaged by the critics and discarded soon after first publication.

In the mid-19th century a district of the Llynfi Valley, Glamorgan, south Wales was known as Bowrington as it was built up when John Bowring was chairman of the local iron company. Bowring&#x27;s ironworks community later became part of the Maesteg Urban District. The name was revived in the 1980s when a shopping development in Maesteg was called the Bowrington Arcade.

Bowring Road, Ramsey, Isle of Man, was named for him in appreciation of his support of universal suffrage for the House of Keys and his efforts to liberalise trade with the island.

As the 4th Governor, several places in Hong Kong came to be named after him:
* Bowring Praya West and Bowring Praya Central were two roads built on reclaimed land during his tenure, but were respectively renamed Des Voeux Road West and Des Voeux Road Central in 1890 after the Praya Reclamation Scheme.
* Bowrington, or Bowring City, is an area Bowring originally built around the estuary of the Wong Nai Chung river, and is the site of the Bowrington Market. He built an extension named the Bowrington Canal, over which the original Bowrington Road (now called Canal Road) and the Bowrington Bridge passed. A road running parallel to and one block to the west of Canal Road retains the name Bowrington Road and houses the street market which serves the district.
* Bowring Street in the district of Jordan, Hong Kong
He was also responsible for the establishment of the Botanic Gardens in Hong Kong, the most indelible mark he made on the colony.

Two species of lizards, &quot;Hemidactylus bowringii&quot; and &quot;Subdoluseps bowringii&quot;, are named in honour of either John Bowring or his son John Charles Bowring.

Bowring was the founder of Hastings Unitarian Church in Hastings, East Sussex, which was built between 1867 and 1868.

Actress Susannah York was the great-great-granddaughter of Bowring.

Journalist and historian Philip Bowring is a descendant of Bowring&#x27;s great uncle Nathaniel. He is the author of a partial biography of Bowring, &quot;Free Trade&#x27;s First Missionary&quot; (2014).

<doc id="326331" wikidata="Q7875309" url="?curid=326331" title="USS Washington (1814)">
<text>USS &quot;Washington&quot; was a ship of the line of the United States Navy. The ship, named for Founding Father and first president of the United States, George Washington, was authorized by the United States Congress on 2 January 1813 and was laid down in May of that year at the Portsmouth Navy Yard under a contract with the shipbuilders, Hart and Badger. The ship was launched on 1 October 1814 and was commissioned at Portsmouth on 26 August 1815, Captain John Orde Creighton in command.

==Service history==
After fitting out, &quot;Washington&quot; sailed for Boston on 3 December 1815. In the spring of the following year, the ship-of-the-line shifted to Annapolis, Maryland, and arrived there on 15 May 1816. Over the ensuing days, the man-of-war welcomed a number of distinguished visitors who came on board to inspect what was, in those days, one of the more powerful American ships afloat. The guests included Commodore John Rodgers and Capt. David Porter, Col. Franklin Wharton, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and President and Mrs. James Madison. The Chief Executive and his lady came on board &quot;at half past meridian, to visit the ship, on which occasion yards were manned and they were saluted with 19 guns and three cheers.&quot;

&quot;Washington&quot; then sailed down Chesapeake Bay and embarked William Pinkney and his suite on 5 June. On 8 June, the ship of the line set sail for the Mediterranean flying the broad pennant of Commodore Isaac Chauncey, the commander of the Navy&#x27;s fledgling Mediterranean Squadron. &quot;Washington&quot; reached Gibraltar on 2 July, en route to her ultimate destination, Naples.

&quot;Washington&quot; made port at Naples on 25 July, and Pickney debarked to commence his special mission—to adjust the claims of American merchants against the Neapolitan authorities. The talks ensued well into August. At the end of the month, the demands of diplomacy apparently satisfied, &quot;Washington&quot; set sail.

For the next two years, the ship-of-the-line operated in the Mediterranean as flagship of the American squadron, providing a display of force to encourage the Barbary states to respect American commerce. Dignitaries that visited the American man-of-war during this Mediterranean cruise included General Nugent, the commander in chief of Austrian forces (on 5 August 1817) and Prince Henry of Prussia (1781–1846) (on 12 August 1817).

On 1 February 1818, Commodore Charles Stewart relieved Commodore Chauncey as commander of the American Mediterranean Squadron, at Syracuse harbor, after which time &quot;Washington&quot; cruised to Messina and the Barbary Coast. She set sail for home on 23 May 1818—convoying 40 American merchantmen—and reached New York on 6 July 1818. The next day, the Vice President of the United States, Daniel D. Tompkins, visited the ship; and the warship blocked her colors at half-mast on the 8th, in honor of the interment of the remains of General Richard Montgomery, who had been killed leading the Continental assault against Quebec in 1775.

Following her return to the United States, &quot;Washington&quot; was commanded by Captain Arthur Sinclair until 1819.

&quot;Washington&quot; did little cruising thereafter, remaining at New York as Commodore Chauncey&#x27;s flagship until 1820. Placed &quot;in ordinary&quot; that year, the ship-of-the-line remained inactive until broken up in 1843.

(The dimensions of the ship are uncertain, since no plan has survived, and there is evidence that the shipbuilder&#x27;s plan was never sent to the Navy.)

<text>Stefan Uroš I (; 1223 – 1 May 1277), known as Uroš the Great () was the King of Serbia from 1243 to 1276, succeeding his brother Stefan Vladislav. He was one of the most important rulers in Serbian history. During his reign the foundations were laid for the expansion of the Serbian medieval state, which would become an empire in the middle of the 14th century.

==Early life==
Stefan Uroš was the youngest son of Stefan the First-Crowned and Anna, the granddaughter of Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice. He had two older half-brothers, on his father&#x27;s side, kings Stefan Radoslav and Stefan Vladislav.

Scholars have argued that Bulgarian influence had been strong and unpopular, causing opposition that led to Vladislav&#x27;s deposition after the death of Asen. The revolting nobility had chosen Uroš as their candidate for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a war for the throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced to give up the crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš captured Vladislav. The main resistance against Uroš was led by Vladislav&#x27;s wife, Beloslava. The hostilities did not last long. Uroš was courteous towards Vladislav, gave him the administration of Zeta.

==Administration==
At 25 years of age, he took the throne from his brother Vladislav, and despite not having support from in-laws as was the case with his brothers, he immediately ruled energetic and determined. Prior to his accession, the land had been looted by the Tatars and there were widespread internal conflicts; Uroš managed in a short time to resolve all important issues in the state and in its foreign policy.

The situation in Europe and in the Balkans were quite favourable for Serbia, which he very cleverly used for his benefit. During his reign Serbia significantly strengthened itself and progressed in every way. Uroš correctly determined the direction in political pretensions through penetrating the south in Macedonia and conflict with Hungary in Podunavlje. The land was politically and militarily prepared for serious politics and definitive fortification of Serbia and the Serb people in the Vardar valley and the middle Podunavlje. Apart from this, Uroš also correctly determined the direction of Serbian trade politics, as he on several occasions in his fight against the Republic of Ragusa wanted to eliminate Ragusan brokerage and exploitation in his state.

Particular significance in his domestic politics is that he strongly stressed the state principle above all else, and subordinated the churches (both Orthodox and Catholic) to state interests. He was instrumental in the definite solution to the conflict between the archbishoprics of Bar and Dubrovnik regarding power in Serbia, resolved in favour of Bar.

Uroš was the first to begin exploiting the mines, which would later become one of the main sources of material wealth and power of the Serbian state in the Middle Ages. As a first result of the opening of mines came the forging of Serbian coins, which he first minted on the Venetian model. He protected and assisted literature and writers; i.e. gave impetus to the preparation of a new, more comprehensive and ornate biography of his grandfather Nemanja, whom he fully modeled himself after.

King Uroš lived a modest patriarchal life, happy and content within his family, and he in contrast to the splendor of the Byzantine court, proudly emphasized modesty to the Byzantine deputies, which dominated at his court, where everyone had to work.

In foreign policy Uroš skillfully used to his advantage the conflict between the Despotate of Epirus and the Empire of Nicaea, two Greek states, both of which sought to inherit the Byzantine Empire and take Constantinople from the Latin Empire. But when the Latin Empire fell, and Emperor Michael Palaiologos of Nicaea took Constantinople, Uroš began to coalite with his wife&#x27;s cousin, Charles of Anjou, who wanted to recapture Constantinople, and through that alliance take as much Byzantine land as possible. Via Charles, who had family ties with the Hungarian kings, Uroš at the end of his reign also approached Hungary, with whom he long had been in a bad relation, and married his eldest son and heir, Stefan Dragutin, to Catherine, the daughter of Hungarian king Stephen V.

Pushed by his in-laws, with the help of the army he received from Hungary, Dragutin, unhappy with not getting more participation in the government, revolted and defeated his father and took over the throne. Uroš retired with his loyals to Hum, where, disappointed, dissatisfied and angry, he died soon thereafter.

==Economic development==
===Mining===
Under Stefan Uroš I, Serbia became a significant power in the Balkans, partly due to economic development through opening of mines. The mines were developed by the &quot;Sasi&quot; (Saxons), who were experienced in the extracting of ore. Their settlements, located by the mines, had privileged status—they lived under their own laws and were allowed to adhere to Catholicism and build their churches. Important mines were located at Novo Brdo, Brskovo and Rudnik.

===Trade===
Economic prosperity was also fostered by the related intensification of trade with the Dalmatian cities of Dubrovnik and Kotor. The increase in the mining of silver and in trade naturally led to the introduction of larger quantities of royal coinage, modeled after the Venetian standard.

==Military operations==
===War with Ragusa===
In 1252–1253, Uroš I was at war with the Republic of Ragusa, which bordered the Hum, which was held by his kinsman Radoslav Andrijić. Radoslav swore to fight Ragusa as long as it was in conflict with Serbia, at the same time boasting relations with Béla IV of Hungary. Ragusa took up an alliance with Bulgaria. Peace was ensured in a charter dated May 22, 1254, and the crisis ended.

During the second half of the 1260s a new war broke out with Ragusa, which was secretly favoured by the Serbian queen. A treaty was signed in 1268, specifying the amount of tribute that Dubrovnik was expected to contribute annually to the Serbian crown. The arrangement remained largely unbroken for the next century.

===War with Hungary===
In 1268 the Serbian king invaded the Hungarian possessions south of the Danube in Mačva, what is now western central Serbia. In spite of some initial success, Stefan Uroš was captured by the Hungarians and forced to purchase his release. A peace treaty was signed between the two kingdoms, and Stefan Uroš&#x27;s son Stefan Dragutin of Serbia was married to Catherine, the daughter of the future king Stephen V of Hungary.

==Conflict with Dragutin==
By the end of his reign, Stefan Uroš apparently succeeded in suppressing the autonomy of Hum, where the local princes became virtually indistinguishable from the rest of the nobility. In his effort to achieve centralization, the king appears to have alienated his eldest son by refusing to grant him an appanage. The conflict between father and son exacerbated, and the king apparently considered making his younger son, the future Stefan Milutin, his heir.

Worried about the inheritance and his very life, Stefan Dragutin finally demanded the throne in 1276. When Stefan Uroš refused, Dragutin rebelled and received help from his Hungarian relatives. The allies defeated the Serbian king and Stefan Uroš was forced to abdicate and retire to an unidentified monastery in Hum where he died a year or two later. His remains were later moved to his monastic foundation of Sopoćani.

==Endowments==
==Family==
King Uroš was married to Helen (d. 1314), a distant cousin of king Charles I of Naples. Various earlier researchers thus believed that Helen herself was a scion of the Capetian House of Anjou. On that assumption, they coined and often used the term: &quot;Helen of Anjou&quot; ( / &quot;Jelena Anžujska&quot;). Contrary to that, newer scholarly analyses have shown that Helen was not an Angevin princess, but various genealogical questions related to her real ancestry and family ties are still considered as unresolved.

King Uroš I and queen Helen had at least three children:
* Stefan Dragutin, who succeeded as king
* Stefan Milutin, who succeeded as king in 1282
* Brnjača, a daughter

<text>Sir George Ferguson Bowen (; 2 November 1821 – 21 February 1899), was an Anglo-Irish author and colonial administrator whose appointments included postings to the Ionian Islands, Queensland, New Zealand, Victoria, Mauritius and Hong Kong.

==Early life==

Bowen was born the eldest son of the Rev. Edward Bowen (1779–1867), Church of Ireland Rector of Taughboyne, a parish in the Laggan district in the east of County Donegal in the north-west of Ulster. It is likely that Bowen was born and raised at Bogay House, just outside the village of Newtown Cunningham, at what was then the northern end of the Church of Ireland Parish of Taughboyne. Bogay (pronounced &#x27;Bo-gay&#x27;) House had been built &quot;c.&quot; 1730, possibly for The 6th Earl of Abercorn, and was later used as the Church of Ireland rectory for Taughboyne in the late eighteenth century and for most of the nineteenth century. One of Bowen&#x27;s brothers was The V. Rev. Edward Bowen, Church of Ireland Dean of Raphoe from 1882 onwards.

Bowen was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Oxford. He matriculated at Oxford in 1840, and graduated with a first-class B.A. in classics in 1844 (promoted to M.A. in 1847). Bowen was twice President of the Oxford Union. He was elected a fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford, and entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn as a student, both in 1844. In 1846 Bowen had some naval training, serving for sixteen days on .

==Service in the Ionian Islands==

In 1847, Bowen was appointed president of the Ionian Academy located in Corfu, a post he held until 1851.

Bowen became the chief secretary to the government of the Ionian Islands in 1854. While in that post, he married the &quot;Contessa&quot; Diamantina di Roma on 28 April 1856. Diamantina was the daughter of &quot;Conte&quot; Giorgio-Candiano Roma and his wife &quot;Contessa&quot; Orsola, &quot;née&quot; di Balsamo. The Roma family were local aristocracy; her father being the President of the Ionian Senate, titular head of the Islands, from 1850 to 1856. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1855 and was advanced to Knight Commander (KCMG) in the following year.

==Governor of Queensland==

In 1859, Bowen was appointed the first Governor of Queensland, a colony that had just been separated from New South Wales. Sworn in on 10 December 1859, Bowen served until 1868. Bowen&#x27;s influence in Queensland was greater than that of the governors in other Australian colonies in a large part due to Robert Herbert, who accompanied Bowen from England, and later became colonial secretary and then first Premier of Queensland in 1860–66. Bowen was interested in the exploration of Queensland and in the establishment of a volunteer force, but incurred some unpopularity by refusing to sanction the issue of inconvertible paper money during the financial crisis of 1866. But overall, he was quite popular in Queensland, so that the citizens requested an extension of his five-year term as governor, resulting in his staying for further two years.

==Governor of New Zealand==

In 1867 Bowen was made Governor of New Zealand, where he was successful in reconciling the Māori reaction to British rule and saw the end of the New Zealand Wars. Bowen also instituted the New Zealand Cross for colonial soldiers, one of the rarest bravery awards in the world and equivalent to the Victoria Cross (he was reprimanded for exceeding his authority, but it was upheld by Queen Victoria herself).

In 1869, Albert Hastings Markham, first lieutenant of submitted a design to Bowen for a national ensign for New Zealand. His proposal, incorporating the Southern Cross, was approved and remains in use to this day. In 1871, he visited Milford Sound aboard and Bowen Falls was named after his wife to mark the occasion.

==Governor of Victoria==

In March 1873, Bowen was transferred to the colony of Victoria as the Governor of Victoria, where he embarked on an endeavour to reduce the expenses of the colony. A political crisis occurred while Bowen took leave in England from January 1875 to January 1876, when the acting governor, Sir William Stawell, showed &quot;too little flexibility in the exercise of his temporary powers&quot;. One of the main issues was the perennial conflict between the Victorian Legislative Council and the Victorian Legislative Assembly; the Council was blocking legislation for its reform and for payment of members.

In January 1878, backed by advice from the Colonial Office, Bowen consented to premier Graham Berry&#x27;s plan to break the deadlock by the wholesale dismissal of public servants on so-called &quot;Black Wednesday&quot;. In May that year, Bowen said that &quot;my reluctant consent, purely on constitutional grounds, to these dismissals ... has damaged my further reputation and my career to a degree that I shall never recover. It will never be forgotten either in England or in the Colony&quot;. However several others, including Hugh Childers and William Ewart Gladstone, approved of Bowen&#x27;s actions, and he was appointed to subsequent vice-regal posts.

==Governor of Mauritius==

Bowen arrived on Mauritius on 4 April 1879, and served as 13th Governor of the colony until 9 December 1880.

==Governor of Hong Kong==

On 30 March 1883, Bowen was made Governor of Hong Kong. During his tenure, his administration established the Hong Kong Observatory, which also served as the meteorological institute of the territory. He founded the first college in Hong Kong, and ordered the construction of the Typhoon Shelter in Causeway Bay, and a government hospital. He retired in 1887, due to ill health.

==Post-governorship==

Bowen returned to England after his time in Hong Kong and was appointed chief of a Royal Commission sent to Malta in December 1887 to help to draft the new constitution for the island. All recommendations made by the commission were adopted. Afterwards, Bowen was sworn into the Privy Council.

==Personal life==

Bowen was married twice.

His first wife was &quot;Contessa&quot; Diamantina di Roma, only daughter of Count Candiano di Roma. Their children were:
* first child, a son who died when twelve days old, born in the Ionian Islands
* Adelaide Diamantina (Nina) Bowen, born 17 August 1858 in the Ionian Islands
* Zoe Caroline Bowen, born 28 August 1860 at Adelaide House (the temporary Government House), Brisbane, Queensland
* Agnes Herbert Bowen, born 26 July 1862 at the first Government House in Brisbane
* George William Howard Bowen, born 9 April 1864 at the first Government House, in Brisbane
* Alfreda Ernestina Albertina Bowen, born 10 April 1869 at Old Government House, Auckland, New Zealand

Diamantina died in London in 1893 at about the age of 60.

He married his second wife, Letitia Florence White, in late 1896 at Chelsea, London. Florence was the daughter of Thomas Luby, a mathematician, and was the widow of Henry White, whom she had married in 1878.

Bowen died on 21 February 1899 in Brighton in Sussex, aged 77 years old. He died from bronchitis after a short illness of two days. He was buried on 25 February 1899 in Kensal Green cemetery in London.

==Legacy==

The following were named after George Bowen:
*Bowen, a town in Queensland
*Bowen Hills, a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland
*Bowen Square, a pleasure garden, opposite the heritage building of AfrAsia Bank, right in the city centre of Port Louis, Mauritius
*Bowen Park, a pleasure garden in Bowen Hills
*Bowen Downs Station, a pastoral lease in outback Queensland
*Bowen Bridge and Bowen Bridge Road, a bridge and the road that crosses it, in Brisbane, Queensland
* Bowen Terrace (and Lower Bowen Terrace), a road in the Brisbane suburb of New Farm
*Bowen Road, Bowen Drive, and Bowen Aqueduct in Hong Kong.
*Bowen Street (now part of the RMIT campus) in Melbourne
*Bowen Street in Wellington, New Zealand.

Queen Victoria issued the Letters Patent and the accompanying Order-in-Council that are Queensland&#x27;s primary founding documents on 6 June 1859. The Letters Patent specifically appointed Sir George Ferguson Bowen as Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of Queensland, endowing him with the legal authority to oversee the installation of self-government by and for the citizens of the colony. This document was #1 in the &#x27;Top 150: Documenting Queensland&#x27; exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives&#x27; events and exhibition program which contributed to the state&#x27;s Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales.

His wife Diamantina appears to have been more popular than George in Queensland, as there are many Queensland places named after her.

Several objects connected to Bowen are held in the collections of the State Library of Queensland, including his ceremonial sword, an 1865 sterling silver ceremonial spade presented to Bowen during turning of the first sod of the first section of the Queensland Northern Railway and an 1882 pastel portrait by artist Henry Gordon Fanner.

<doc id="326337" wikidata="Q3274562" url="?curid=326337" title="Ourasi">
<text>Ourasi (7 April 1980 – 12 January 2013) was a chestnut French Trotter. He earned $2,913,314 during his career. His harness racing victories included three consecutive Prix d&#x27;Amérique at Vincennes, the second by approximately 18 lengths. Ourasi is considered to be the horse of the century. He won more than 50 consecutive races. Jean-René Gougeon (who died in July 2008), his trainer and driver, won the &quot;Prix d&#x27;Amérique&quot; with Ourasi 3 times. Ourasi won the &quot;Prix d&#x27;Amérique&quot; a fourth time with Michel &quot;Minou&quot; Gougeon (the brother of Jean René Gougeon) as driver.

==Background==
Ourasi was born at the Haras de Saint-Georges, in Saint-Étienne-l&#x27;Allier, into a small stud belonging to Raoul Ostheimer and Rachel Tessier. He was sired by Greyhound F out of Fleurasie by Remember F (his sire was not the illustrious American trotter of the same name).

==Racing record==
When Ourasi was 2 years old, he made his racing debut. He was trained by Rachel Ostheimer and driven by Raoul Ostheimer, who was deaf.

At the beginning of 1989, when Ourasi was 9 years old and trying to win his fourth Prix d&#x27;Amérique, the French president, François Mitterrand, came to see the race. Few expected Ourasi to lose. However, he finished third behind &quot;Queila Gédé&quot; and &quot;Potin d&#x27;Amour&quot;.
On January 28, 1990, Ourasi broke the Prix d&#x27;Amérique&#x27;s record.

==Retirement==

After mating with 130 mares from France, Scandinavia, and the United States, Ourasi produced only 8 foals from his first year at stud. Specialists were called from around the world, but nothing could be done, and within 10 years, Ourasi produced just 38 foals. None of these foals became champions.

==Death==

On January 12, 2013, Ourasi was euthanized following a brief period of illness. According to Pierre Lamy, the owner of the farm where Ourasi was kept, he hadn&#x27;t eaten for over 4 days and refused to sleep before being put down. He is buried at Haras de Gruchy in Calvados.

==Statue==

In June 2014, a year after the death of Ourasi, a life-sized statue was unveiled at the Hippodrome de Vincennes in his honour. Created by sculptor Arnaud Kasper over the span of eight months, the monument weighs over 600 kg and stands at 2.20m tall. It was entirely financed by the &quot;LeTrot&quot; Company and revealed to the public on June 22 at 4 PM in the presence of Dominique de Bellaigue, president of LeTrot, and Michel &quot;Minou&quot; Gougeon, the rider who led Ourasi to his fourth Prix d&#x27;Amérique victory in 1990.

It is the tallest of the three camel species; adult males stand at the shoulder, while females are tall. Males typically weigh between , and females weigh between .
The dromedary&#x27;s distinctive features include its long, curved neck, narrow chest, a single hump and long hairs on the throat, shoulders and hump. The coat is generally a shade of brown. The hump, tall or more, is made of fat bound together by fibrous tissue. 

The dromedary feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, such as the ability to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months. It is mainly active during daylight hours and form herds of about 20 individuals, which are led by a dominant male. 

The dromedary has not occurred naturally in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first domesticated in the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago, or in Somalia where there are paintings in Laas Geel that figure it from 5,000 to 9,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several North African tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a pack animal.

==Etymology==
The common name &quot;dromedary&quot; comes from the Old French &#x27; or the Late Latin . These originated from the Greek word , ( &#x27;, ), meaning &quot;running&quot; or &quot;runner&quot;, used in Greek in the combination (), literally &quot;running camel&quot;, to refer to the dromedary. The first recorded use in English of the name &quot;dromedary&quot; occurred in the 14th century. The dromedary possibly originated in Arabia or Somalia and is therefore sometimes referred to as the Arabian or East African camel. The word &quot;camel&quot; generally refers either to the dromedary or the congeneric Bactrian; the word came into English via Old Norman, from the Latin word &#x27;, from Ancient Greek (&#x27;), ultimately from a Semitic source akin to Hebrew (&#x27;) and Arabic (&#x27;).

==Taxonomy and classification==

The dromedary shares the genus &quot;Camelus&quot; with the Bactrian camel (&quot;C. bactrianus&quot;) and the wild Bactrian camel (&quot;C. ferus&quot;). The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) was the first to describe the species of &quot;Camelus&quot;. He named two species in his &quot;History of Animals&quot;; the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The dromedary was given its current binomial name &quot;Camelus dromedarius&quot; by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type – slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.

In 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and colleagues carried out a phylogenetic study of the evolutionary relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini – consisting of the three &quot;Camelus&quot; species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) – and Lamini, which consists of the alpaca (&quot;Vicugna pacos&quot;), the guanaco (&quot;Lama guanicoe&quot;), the llama (&quot;L. glama&quot;) and the vicuña (&quot;V. vicugna&quot;). The study showed the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.

The dromedary and the Bactrian camel often interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Where the ranges of the species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia, and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding. The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the dromedary and the Bactrian camel should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene showed the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.

==Genetics and hybrids==

The dromedary has 74 diploid chromosomes, the same as other camelids. The autosomes consist of five pairs of small to medium-sized metacentrics and submetacentrics. The X chromosome is the largest in the metacentric and submetacentric group. There are 31 pairs of acrocentrics. The dromedary&#x27;s karyotype is similar to that of the Bactrian camel.

Camel hybridization began in the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.

==Evolution==
The extinct &quot;Protylopus&quot;, which occurred in North America during the upper Eocene, is the oldest and the smallest-known camel. During the transition from Pliocene to Pleistocene, several mammals faced extinction. This period marked the successful radiation of the &quot;Camelus&quot; species, which migrated over the Bering Strait and dispersed widely into Asia, eastern Europe and Africa. By the Pleistocene, ancestors of the dromedary occurred in the Middle East and northern Africa.

The modern dromedary probably evolved in the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was closely related to the earliest Old World camels. It was previously believed that this hypothesis was supported by the dromedary foetus having two humps, but modern studies have shown this to be false. A jawbone of a dromedary that dated from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the Red Sea.

In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University wrote that the dromedary exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but did not have to depend upon its products.

==Characteristics==

The dromedary is the tallest of the three camel species. Adult males range in height between at the shoulder; females range between . Males typically weigh between ; females range between . The distinctive features are its long, curved neck, narrow chest and single hump (the Bactrian camel has two), thick, double-layered eyelashes and bushy eyebrows. They have sharp vision and a good sense of smell. The male has a soft palate ( in Arabic) nearly long, which he inflates to produce a deep pink sac. The palate, which is often mistaken for the tongue, dangles from one side of the mouth and is used to attract females during the mating season.

The coat is generally brown but can range from black to nearly white. Leese reported piebald dromedaries in Kordofan and Darfur in Sudan. Piebald coloration in some camels is thought to be caused by the &quot;KITW1&quot; allele of the KIT gene, though there is likely at least one other mutation that also causes white spotting. The hair is long and concentrated on the throat, shoulders and the hump. The large eyes are protected by prominent supraorbital ridges; the ears are small and rounded. The hump is at least high. The dromedary has long, powerful legs with two toes on each foot. The feet resemble flat, leathery pads. Like the giraffe, dromedaries move both legs on one side of the body at the same time.

Compared with the Bactrian camel, the dromedary has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids of the genus &quot;Lama&quot;, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet, and a greater height at the shoulder. The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the &quot;Lama&quot; species.

===Anatomy===

The cranium of the dromedary consists of a postorbital bar, a tympanic bulla filled with spongiosa, a well-defined sagittal crest, a long facial part and an indented nasal bone. Typically, there are eight sternal and four non-sternal pairs of ribs. The spinal cord is nearly long; it terminates in the second and third sacral vertebra. The fibula is reduced to a malleolar bone. The dromedary is a digitigrade animal; it walks on its toes, which are known as digits. It lacks the second and fifth digits. The front feet are wide and long; they are larger than the hind feet, which measure wide and long.
The dromedary has 22 milk teeth, which are eventually replaced by 34 permanent teeth. The dental formula for permanent dentition is , and for milk dentition. In the juvenile, the lower first molars develop by 12 to 15 months and the permanent lower incisors appear at 4.5 to 6.5 years of age. All teeth are in use by 8 years. The lenses of the eyes contain crystallin, which constitutes 8 to 13% of the protein present there.

The skin is black; the epidermis is thick and the dermis is thick. The hump is composed of fat bound together by fibrous tissue. There are no glands on the face; males have glands that appear to be modified apocrine sweat glands that secrete pungent, coffee-coloured fluid during the rut, located on either side of the neck midline. The glands generally grow heavier during the rut, and range from . Each cover hair is associated with an arrector pilli muscle, a hair follicle, a ring of sebaceous glands and a sweat gland. Females have cone-shaped, four-chambered mammary glands that are long with a base diameter of . These glands can produce milk with up to 90% water content even if the mother is at risk of dehydration.

The heart weighs around ; it has two ventricles with the tip curving to the left. The pulse rate is 50 beats per minute. The dromedary is the only mammal with oval red blood corpuscles, which facilitates blood flow during dehydration. The pH of the blood varies from 7.1 to 7.6 (slightly alkaline). The individual&#x27;s state of hydration and sex and the time of year can influence blood values. The lungs lack lobes. A dehydrated camel has a lower breathing rate. Each kidney has a capacity of , and can produce urine with high chloride concentrations. Like the horse, the dromedary has no gall bladder. The grayish violet, crescent-like spleen weighs less than . The triangular, four-chambered liver weighs ; its dimensions are .

====Reproductive system====
The ovaries are reddish, circular and flattened. They are enclosed in a conical bursa and have the dimensions during anestrus. The oviducts are long. The uterus is bicornuate. The vagina is long and has well-developed Bartholin&#x27;s glands. The vulva is deep and has a small clitoris. The placenta is diffuse and epitheliochorial, with a crescent-like chorion.

The penis is covered by a triangular penile sheath that opens backwards; it is about long. The scrotum is located high in the perineum with the testicles in separate sacs. Testicles are long, deep and wide. The right testicle is often smaller than the left. The typical mass of either testicle is less than ; during the rut the mass increases from . The Cowper&#x27;s gland is white, almond-shaped and lacks seminal vesicles; the prostate gland is dark yellow, disc-shaped and divided into two lobes.
The camel epididymis interstitium revealed several blood vessels harboring special regulatory devices such as the spiral arteries, spiral veins, and throttle arterioles.

===Health and diseases===
The dromedary generally suffers from fewer diseases than other domestic livestock such as goats and cattle. Temperature fluctuations occur throughout the day in a healthy dromedary – the temperature falls to its minimum at dawn, rises until sunset and falls during the night. Nervous camels may vomit if they are carelessly handled; this does not always indicate a disorder. Rutting males may develop nausea.

The dromedary is prone to trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by a parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly. The main symptoms are recurring fever, anaemia and weakness; the disease is typically fatal for the camel. Brucellosis is another prominent malady. In an observational study, the seroprevalence of this disease was generally low (2 to 5%) in nomadic or moderately free dromedaries, but it was higher (8 to 15%) in denser populations. Brucellosis is caused by different biotypes of &quot;Brucella abortus&quot; and &quot;B. melitensis&quot;. Other internal parasites include &quot;Fasciola gigantica&quot; (trematode), two types of cestode (tapeworm) and various nematodes (roundworms). Among external parasites, &quot;Sarcoptes&quot; species cause sarcoptic mange. In a 2000 study in Jordan, 83% of the 32 camels studied tested positive for sarcoptic mange. In another study, dromedaries were found to have natural antibodies against the rinderpest and ovine rinderpest viruses.

In 2013, a seroepidemiological study (a study investigating the patterns, causes and effects of a disease on a specific population on the basis of serologic tests) in Egypt was the first to show the dromedary might be a host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A 2013–14 study of dromedaries in Saudi Arabia concluded the unusual genetic stability of MERS-CoV coupled with its high seroprevalence in the dromedary makes this camel a highly probable host for the virus. The full genome sequence of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in this study showed a 99.9% match to the genomes of human clade B MERS-CoV. Another study in Saudi Arabia showed the presence of MERS-CoV in 90% of the evaluated dromedaries and suggested that camels could be the animal source of MERS-CoV.
Fleas and ticks are common causes of physical irritation. &quot;Hyalomma dromedarii&quot; is especially adapted to arid conditions, changing its moulting process to complete more or all of its life cycle on a single host if stressed, and having an unusually wide host range. The larvae are not well understood but their questing phase is assumed to occur during the winter, which is also when rain arrives. The nymphs infest the host mostly in January, then the adults May to September. In a study in Egypt, &quot;H. dromedarii&quot; was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with ivermectin, which is not effective against &quot;Hyalomma&quot; tick infestations. Larvae of the camel nasal fly &quot;Cephalopsis titillator&quot; can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, pulmonary disorders caused by &quot;Pasteurella&quot; such as hemorrhagic septicemia and &quot;Rickettsia&quot; species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by &quot;Streptothrix&quot; and deficiency of salt in the diet.

==Ecology==

The dromedary is diurnal (active mainly during daylight); free-ranging herds feed and roam throughout the day, though they rest during the hottest hours around noon. The night is mainly spent resting. Dromedaries form cohesive groups of about 20 individuals, which consist of several females led by a dominant male. Females may also lead in turns. Some males either form bachelor groups or roam alone. Herds may congregate to form associations of hundreds of camels during migrations at the time of natural disasters. The males of the herd prevent female members from interacting with bachelor males by standing or walking between them and sometimes driving the bachelor males away. In Australia, short-term home ranges of feral dromedaries cover ; annual home ranges can spread over several thousand square kilometres.

Special behavioral features of the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, with the exception of rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females, in particular, remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behavior. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalize and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in the sand.

Free-ranging dromedaries face large predators typical of their regional distribution, which includes wolves, lions and tigers.

===Diet===
The dromedary&#x27;s diet consists mostly of foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation – mostly thorny plants. A study said the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%). The dromedary is primarily a browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter. The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.

In the Sahara, 332 plant species have been recorded as food plants of the dromedary. These include &quot;Aristida pungens&quot;, &quot;Acacia tortilis&quot;, &quot;Panicum turgidum&quot;, &quot;Launaea arborescens&quot; and &quot;Balanites aegyptiaca&quot;. The dromedary eats &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Atriplex&quot; and &quot;Salsola&quot; when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer &quot;Trichodesma zeylanicum&quot; and &quot;Euphorbia tannensis&quot;. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as &quot;Vigna aconitifolia&quot;, &quot;V. mungo&quot;, &quot;Cyamopsis tetragonolaba&quot;, &quot;Melilotus parviflora&quot;, &quot;Eruca sativa&quot;, &quot;Trifolium&quot; species and &quot;Brassica campestris&quot;. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for an equal amount of time.

==Biology of the Dromedary Camel==
===Adaptations===
The dromedary is specially adapted to its desert habitat; these adaptations are aimed at conserving water and regulating body temperature. The bushy eyebrows and the double row of eyelashes prevent sand and dust from entering the eyes during strong windstorms, and shield them from the sun&#x27;s glare. The dromedary is able to close its nostrils voluntarily; this assists in water conservation. The dromedary can conserve water by reducing perspiration by fluctuating the body temperature throughout the day from . The kidneys are specialized to minimize water loss through excretion. Groups of camels avoid excess heat from the environment by pressing against each other. The dromedary can tolerate greater than 30% water loss, which is generally impossible for other mammals. In temperatures between , it needs water every 10 to 15 days. In the hottest temperatures, the dromedary takes water every four to seven days. Dromedaries have a quick rate of rehydration, drinking up to in a single sitting, at a rate of per minute. The dromedary has a rete mirabile, a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which uses countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain. This effectively controls the temperature of the brain.

The hump stores up to of fat, which the camel can break down into energy to meet its needs when resources are scarce; the hump also helps dissipate body heat. When this tissue is metabolized, through fat metabolization, it releases energy while causing water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration (as oxygen is required for the metabolic process): overall, there is a net decrease in water. If the hump is small, the animal can show signs of starvation. In a 2005 study, the mean volume of adipose tissues (in the external part of the hump that have cells to store lipids) is related to the dromedary&#x27;s unique mechanism of food and water storage. In case of starvation, they can even eat fish and bones, and drink brackish and salty water. The hair is longer on the throat, hump and shoulders. Though the padded hooves effectively support the camel&#x27;s weight on the ground, they are not suitable for walking on slippery and muddy surfaces.

===Reproduction===

Camels have a slow growth rate and reach sexual maturity slower than sheep or goat. The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and depends on the individual, as does the reproductive period. Both sexes might mature by three to five years of age, though successful breeding could take longer. Camels are described as atypical seasonal breeders; they exhibit spermatogenesis throughout the whole year with a reduction in spermatogenesis during the nonbreeding season compared to that in the
breeding season (Zayed et al., 1995). The breeding season in Egypt is during spring; the spring months. Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.

During the reproductive season, males splash their urine on their tails and nether regions. To attract females they extrude their soft palate – a trait unique to the dromedary. As the male gurgles, copious quantities of saliva turns to foam and covers the mouth. Males threaten each other for dominance over the female by trying to stand taller than the other, making low noises and a series of head movements including lowering, lifting and bending their necks backward. Males try to defeat other males by biting the opponent&#x27;s legs and taking the head between his jaws. Copulation begins with foreplay; the male smells the female&#x27;s genitalia and often bites her there or around her hump. The male forces the female to sit, then grasps her with his forelegs. Camelmen often aid the male insert his penis into the female&#x27;s vulva. The male dromedary&#x27;s ability to penetrate the female on his own is disputed, though feral populations in Australia reproduce naturally. Copulation takes from 7 to 35 minutes, averaging 11 to 15 minutes. Normally, three to four ejaculations occur. The semen of a Bikaneri dromedary is white and viscous, with a pH of around 7.8.

A single calf is born after a gestation period of 15 months. Calves move freely by the end of their first day. Nursing and maternal care continue for one to two years. In a study to find whether young could exist on milk substitutes, two male, month-old camels were separated from their mothers and were fed on milk substitutes prepared commercially for lambs, and they grew to normal weights for male calves after 30 days. Lactational yield can vary with species, breed, individual, region, diet, management conditions and lactating stage. The largest quantity of milk is produced during the early period of lactation. The lactation period can vary between nine and eighteen months.

Dromedaries are induced ovulators. Oestrus may be cued by the nutritional status of the camel and the length of day. If mating does not occur, the follicle, which grows during oestrus, usually regresses within a few days. In one study, 35 complete oestrous cycles were observed in five nonpregnant females over 15 months. The cycles were about 28 days long; follicles matured in six days, maintained their size for 13 days, and returned to their original size in eight days. In another study, ovulation could be best induced when the follicle reaches a size of . In another study, pregnancy in females could be recognized as early as 40 to 45 days of gestation by the swelling of the left uterine horn, where 99.5% of pregnancies were located.

==Range==
Its range included hot, arid regions of northern Africa, Ethiopia, the Near East, and western and central Asia. The dromedary typically thrives in areas with a long dry season and a short wet season. They are sensitive to cold and humidity, though some breeds can thrive in humid conditions.

The dromedary was first domesticated in the southern Arabian Peninsula around 4000–3000 BC. In the ninth or tenth century BC, the dromedary became popular in the Near East. The Persian invasion of Egypt under Cambyses in 525 BC introduced domesticated camels to the area. The Persian camels were not well-suited to trading or travel over the Sahara; journeys across the desert were made on chariots pulled by horses. The dromedary was introduced into Egypt from south-western Asia (Arabia and Persia). The popularity of dromedaries increased after the Islamic conquest of North Africa. While the invasion was accomplished largely on horseback, new links to the Middle East allowed camels to be imported &quot;en masse&quot;. These camels were well-suited to long desert journeys and could carry a great deal of cargo, allowing substantial trans-Saharan trade for the first time. In Libya, dromedaries were used for transport and their milk and meat constituted the local diet.

Dromedaries were also shipped from south-western Asia to Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Canary Islands, the Americas and Australia. Dromedaries were introduced into Spain in 1020 AD and to Sicily in 1059 AD. Camels were exported to the Canary Islands in 1405 during the European colonisation of the area, and are still extant there, especially in Lanzarote and to the south of Fuerteventura. Attempts to introduce dromedaries into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently they exist in small numbers or are absent in these areas.

In 1840, about six camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, but only one survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the explorer John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.

===Current distribution of captive animals===
In the early 21st century, the domesticated dromedary is found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World.

====Africa====
Africa has more than 80% of the world&#x27;s total dromedary population; it occurs in almost every desert zone in the northern part of the continent. The Sahel marks the southern extreme of its range, where the annual rainfall is around . The Horn of Africa has nearly 35% of the world&#x27;s dromedaries; most of the region&#x27;s stock is in Somalia, followed by Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia (as of the early 2000s). According to the Yearbook of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for 1984, eastern Africa had about 10 million dromedaries, the largest population of Africa. Western Africa followed with 2.14 million, while northern Africa had nearly 0.76 million. Populations in Africa increased by 16% from 1994 to 2005.

====Asia====
In Asia, nearly 70% of the population occurs in India and Pakistan. The combined population of the dromedary and the Bactrian camel decreased by around 21% between 1994 and 2004. The dromedary is sympatric with the Bactrian camel in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central and southwestern Asia. India has a dromedary population of less than one million, with most (0.67 million) in the state of Rajasthan. Populations in Pakistan decreased from 1.1 million in 1994 to 0.8 million in 2005 – a 29% decline. According to the FAO, the dromedary population in six countries of the Persian Gulf was nearly 0.67 million in 2003. In the Persian Gulf region the dromedary is locally classified into breeds including Al-Majahem, Al-Hamrah, Al-Safrah, Al-Zarkah and Al-Shakha, based on coat colour. The UAE has three prominent breeds: Racing camel, Al-Arabiat and Al-Kazmiat.

===Feral population===

Feral dromedary populations occur in Australia, where they were introduced in 1840. The total dromedary population in Australia was 500,000 in 2005. Nearly 99% of the populations are feral, and they have an annual growth rate of 10%. Most of the Australian feral camels are dromedaries, with only a few Bactrian camels. Most of the dromedaries occur in Western Australia, with smaller populations in the Northern Territory, Western Queensland and northern South Australia.

Feral dromedary populations notwithstanding, the wild dromedary camel as opposed to the now domesticated species has been functionally extinct from the wild for the past 2,000 years.

==Relationship with humans==
The strength and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal. According to Richard Bulliet, they can be used for a wide variety of purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, and trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Rashaida, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.

Camel urine and camel milk are used for medicinal purposes.

===Riding camels===

Although the role of the camel is diminishing with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 6th century BC. It is particularly prized for its capability to outrun horses in the deserts. Record of its use during the time of Alexander the Great indicate that the animal could cover up to 50 miles per day for a week and they could go for up to a month without water. An account by Aurelian also cited that, in his escape to Euphrates, Zenobia used a dromedary to outrun her pursuers after she was defeated at Palmyra.

The dromedary also remains popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world. Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen, and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.

The ideal riding camel is strong, slender and long-legged with thin, supple skin. The special adaptations of the dromedary&#x27;s feet allow it to walk with ease on sandy and rough terrain and on cold surfaces. The camels of the Bejas of Sudan and the Hedareb, Bilen, and the Tigre people of Eritrea and the Anafi camel bred in Sudan are common breeds used as riding camels.

According to Leese, the dromedary walks with four speeds or gaits: walk, jog, fast run and canter. The first is the typical speed of walking, around . Jog is the most common speed, nearly on level ground. He estimated a speed of during a fast run, by observing northern African and Arabian dromedaries. He gave no speed range to describe the canter, but implied it was a type of gallop that if induced could exhaust the camel and the rider. Canter could be used only for short periods of time, for example in races.

The ideal age to start training dromedaries for riding is three years, although they may be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel&#x27;s head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads before the age of six. Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding: the Arabian &quot;markloofa&quot; used by single riders and the Indian &quot;pakra&quot; used when two riders mount the same camel.

===Baggage and draught camels===
The baggage camel should be robust and heavy. Studies have recommended the camel should have either a small or a large head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy. The dromedary can be trained to carry baggage from the age of five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six. The &quot;hawia&quot; is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan. The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.

Draught camels are used for several purposes including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It may be used for ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day – four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.

===Dairy products===

Camel milk is a staple food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. It consists of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, but it does not compare favourably with sheep milk.

Daily milk yield generally varies from and from 1.3% to 7.8% of the body weight. Milk yield varies geographically and depends upon the animals&#x27; diet and living conditions. At the peak of lactation, a healthy female would typically provide milk per day. Leese estimated a lactating female would yield besides the amount ingested by the calf. The Pakistani dromedary, which is considered a better milker and bigger, can yield when well-fed. Dromedaries in Somalia may be milked between two and four times a day, while those in Afar, Ethiopia, may be milked up to seven times a day.

The acidity of dromedary milk stored at increases at a slower rate than that of cow milk. Though the preparation of butter from dromedary milk is difficult, it is produced in small amounts by nomads, optimized at 22.5% fat in the cream. In 2001, the ability of dromedary milk to form curd was studied; coagulation did not show curd formation, and had a pH of 4.4. It was much different from curd produced from cow milk, and had a fragile, heterogeneous composition probably composed of casein flakes. Nevertheless, cheese and other dairy products can be made from camel milk. A study found bovine calf rennet could be used to coagulate dromedary milk. A special factory has been set up in Nouakchott to pasteurise and make cheese from camel milk. Mystical beliefs surround the use of camel milk in some places; for example, it may be used as an aphrodisiac in Ethiopia.

===Meat===
The meat of a five-year-old dromedary has a typical composition of 76% water, 22% protein, 1% fat, and 1% ash. The carcass, weighing for a five-year-old dromedary, is composed of nearly 57% muscle, 26% bone and 17% fat. A seven-to-eight-year-old camel can produce a carcass of . The meat is bright red to a dark brown or maroon, while the fat is white. It has the taste and texture of beef. A study of the meat of Iranian dromedaries showed its high glycogen content, which makes it taste sweet like horse meat. The carcasses of well-fed camels were found to be covered with a thin layer of good quality fat. In a study of the fatty acid composition of raw meat taken from the hind legs of seven one-to-three years old males, 51.5% of the fatty acids were saturated, 29.9% mono-unsaturated, and 18.6% polyunsaturated. The major fatty acids in the meat were palmitic acid (26.0%), oleic acid (18.9%) and linoleic acid (12.1%). In the hump, palmitic acid was dominant (34.4%), followed by oleic acid (28.2%), myristic acid (10.3%) and stearic acid (10%).

Dromedary slaughter is more difficult than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle because of the size of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage – the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass – is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is often eaten by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and &quot;shawarma&quot;. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality. In Somalian and Djiboutian culture, the dromedary is a staple food and can be found in many recipes and dishes.

A 2005 report issued jointly by the Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details five cases of bubonic plague in humans resulting from the ingestion of raw camel liver. Four of the five patients had severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis. &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; was isolated from the camel&#x27;s bone marrow, from the jird (&quot;Meriones libycus&quot;) and from fleas (&quot;Xenopsylla cheopis&quot;) captured at the camel&#x27;s corral.

===Camel hair, wool and hides===
Camels in hot climates generally do not develop long coats. Camel hair is light, and has low thermal conductivity and durability, and is thus suitable for manufacturing warm clothes, blankets, tents, and rugs. Hair of highest quality is typically obtained from juvenile or feral camels. In India, camels are clipped usually in spring and around hair is produced per clipping. In colder regions one clipping can yield as much as . A dromedary can produce wool per year, whereas a Bactrian camel has an annual yield of nearly . Dromedaries under the age of two years have a fine undercoat that tends to fall off and should be cropped by hand. Little information about camel hides has been collected but they are usually of inferior quality and are less preferred for manufacturing leather.

<text>Council of Ministers is a traditional name given to the supreme executive organ in some governments. It is usually equivalent to the term cabinet. The term Council of State is a similar name that also may refer to a cabinet, but the terms are not equal in certain countries (for example, in Spain and India). Councils of Ministers are usually composed of those government ministers who are responsible for a ministry. They are usually led by a President of the Council of Ministers, a term that is commonly translated, or used synonymously, as prime minister or premier.

<text>The National Roads and Motorways in [[Greece]] constitute the main road network of the country. These two types of roads are distinct in terms of their construction specifications. Their main difference is that motorways (Greek: Αυτοκινητόδρομοι) adhere to higher quality construction standards than National Roads (Greek: Εθνικές Οδοί).

For example, a typical motorway (highway) in Greece consists of six or four lanes (three or two lanes in each direction) plus an emergency lane, separated by a central barrier. Entrances and exits to the motorways are only provided at grade-separated junctions (interchanges) and there are no traffic lights. Greek motorways are generally organized so that the odd-numbered motorways are of north-south alignment and the even-numbered motorways are of east-west alignment. However, there are many exceptions.

A typical National Road in Greece is usually a single carriageway or limited-access road with at-grade intersections and with one or two traffic lanes for each direction, usually with an emergency lane on each side as well. The designation of some important roads of Greece as &quot;national&quot; was first decided by a 1955 decree, while a minister&#x27;s decision in 1963 determined the numbering of these roads. In 1998, a survey of the Hellenic Statistical Authority defined some new national roads that were constructed after the 1963 decision.

The naming system of motorways and National Roads is different. For example, &quot;A2&quot; refers to the Egnatia Odos motorway, while &quot;GR-2&quot; refers to National Road 2. All motorways are named by using the capital letter &quot;A&quot;, followed by a number (e.g. A1). The main motorways of Greece have a single digit number and auxiliary motorways perpendicular to the main ones have a double digit number (e.g. A25). Motorways have their own white-on-green signs, while National Roads are designated by white-on-blue signs.

The construction of the Greek motorway network has been, to a large extent, a very complex and demanding project due to the peculiarities of the geomorphology of the areas through which the new roads pass. The Greek mainland is extremely mountainous; the local topography as well as environmental concerns regarding the local flora and fauna played a decisive role in the final route design. In order to overcome these difficulties, the construction of multiple large and expensive technical works, such as tunnels and bridges, was necessary in many cases. Indicatively, the total number of tunnels built along the four Greek major motorways (A1, A2, A5 and A8) is about 150 and their total length is about 200 km (measured as a single bore).

With a total length of about 2320 km as of 2020, Greece&#x27;s motorway network is the biggest one in Southeastern Europe and one of the most advanced in Europe.

==Motorways==
Greece&#x27;s motorway network has been extensively modernized throughout the 2000s and part of it is still under construction. Most of it was completed by early 2017. There are a total of 10 main routes throughout the Greek mainland and Crete, from which some feature numerous branches/auxiliary routes, as described in the listing below.

===Greek motorways according to ministerial decree of 2015===
===A1 (Athens - Thessaloniki - Evzonoi)===

The A1 motorway is the oldest and most important motorway of Greece, connecting the country&#x27;s largest cities, Athens and Thessaloniki and passing through many important regions of Greece on a south-north direction. Section Chalastra - Evzonoi was constructed earlier as an expressway, with no upgrade planned.

The full length of this motorway is around 553 km or 346 miles, including 14 km or 8.7 miles of shared route with the A2 (Egnatia Odos). Note that until recently, the &quot;P&quot; in &quot;PAThE&quot; referred to Patras, but the Patra – Athens section has now become part of the A8 (Olympia Odos), belonging to a different project.

* The A11 motorway is a branch of the A1, connecting it with the city of Chalcis.
* The A12 motorway is a planned branch of the A1, connecting it with the city of Volos. Upgrade of the pre-existing section is under way.
* The A13 motorway is a now cancelled branch of the A1, from Thiva to Elefsina; connecting it with the A6 (Attiki Odos) and serving as a western bypass of Athens Metropolitan Area.

===A2 (Egnatia Odos)===
The A2 motorway, also called Egnatia Odos (Egnatia Motorway), is a motorway situated in northern Greece, connecting several major cities on the way. It starts at the port of Igoumenitsa and ends at Kipoi border crossing with Turkey.

Part of its length, a section of about 360 km (220 mi) from Evros to Thessaloniki, parallels the ancient Roman Via Egnatia, which ran from modern Durrës in Albania to Thessaloniki and thence to Byzantium (now Istanbul, Turkey). The project has therefore been dubbed a modern Via Egnatia (in Greek, Egnatia Odos / Εγνατία Οδός). However, the parallel is not exact; the original Via Egnatia was much longer (1,120 km / 696 miles) and its western section, from Thessaloniki to the Adriatic Sea, ran much further north than the modern road.

Specifically, there are auxiliary routes to Albania and Bulgaria, with the main route leading to Turkey. North Macedonia is accessed through the A1 (AThE), as described above, or via the A27 (see below). Another auxiliary route runs close to the Evros river in the prefecture of the same name, reaching a point where Greece&#x27;s, Turkey&#x27;s and Bulgaria&#x27;s borders meet. Some of those auxiliary routes are not yet motorways, but typical 2-lane expressways, although they are of considerably higher quality than other similar expressways in the rest of Greece. The project (including most of the auxiliary routes), was completed in 2009, with the length of the main route being 670 kilometers or 416 miles, making it the longest motorway in Greece.

* The A24 motorway is a branch of the A2, referred to as the Thessaloniki – Nea Moudania Motorway or Chalkidiki Motorway, connecting Thessaloniki to Nea Moudania on the Chalkidiki peninsula. As it passes through the eastern periphery of Thessaloniki the A24 becomes part of the Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road (&quot;Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos&quot;, ).
* The A25 motorway is a branch of the A2 and lies between Thessaloniki to the Greek–Bulgarian border crossing, via Serres (taking over parts of the GR-12).
* The A27 motorway is a partially complete motorway that branches off the A2 north of Kozani, before heading towards Ptolemaida, Florina and the border crossing with North Macedonia at Niki. During 2012, tenders were announced for the construction of the 14 kilometers section from Florina up to the border crossing with North Macedonia. Construction of this section started in 2013, finished in 2015 and it was opened to traffic on 20 May 2016. The Ptolemaida - Florina part is currently an expressway, planned to be upgraded to a motorway.
* The A29 motorway branches off the A2 near Siatista, and serves the city of Kastoria and the Greek–Albanian border crossing at Krystallopigi.

=== A3 (Central Greece Motorway) ===
The A3 motorway, or the Central Greece Motorway (usually referred to as just E65) is currently under construction. It will link the A1 (AThE) near Lamia with the A2 (Egnatia Odos) near Grevena, and carry the European route E65. Its total length will be .

Construction began in 2009, lasted 2 years and stopped in 2011 due to the financial crisis. At the end of 2013 it was decided to proceed with the immediate construction of the central middle section, Trikala–Xyniada with a length of 80 km, while construction of the northern (Grevena–Trikala) and southern (Xyniada–Lamia) sections was postponed.

The middle section between Xyniada and Trikala was inaugurated and opened to traffic on December 22, 2017. In October 2018 the European Commission approved the funding for the construction of the southern section, Xyniada - Lamia, which out of the 32,5km, the 14,2 km section from the A1 to Karpenissi I/C is opened to traffic on July 15, 2021, while the rest is expected to be completed by 2024. The construction of the northern section, Trikala–Egnatia Odos junction, has started on November of 2021 with completion due by 2025.

===A5 (Ionia Odos)===
The A5 motorway, also referred to as the Ionia Odos (Ionian Motorway), is a fully operational motorway since 3 August 2017 when its last section under construction was delivered to traffic. It starts from Ioannina at the A2 (Egnatia Odos) interchange, and currently ends at Rio, in Patras, after crossing the Corinthian Gulf through the Rio-Antirrio bridge. There, it connects to the A8 (see below).

The route passes through most of western continental Greece, along the Ionian Sea, hence its name &quot;Ionia Odos&quot;. Work on the majority of the highway began in spring 2006 and would span six years, to be completed by 2012. Though, because of economic problems of the constructing companies, all construction works were halted in 2011, but since mid-2013 works on the whole of the 196 km motorway started again. The Antirrion - Ioannina section was completed in August 2017.

The Patras - Pyrgos section is currently under construction with completion due in 2025. The motorway will in future be extended to Tsakona (near Meligalas) where it will intersect with the A7 (Moreas). The full length of the motorway will be on completion.
* The A52 motorway, also known as Ambrakia Odos (Amvrakia Motorway) is a branch of the A5 connecting it with the island of Lefkada and the undersea-tunnel of Aktio, leading to Preveza. This motorway section is expected to serve the popular tourist region around the Ambracian Gulf. At long, the motorway was expected to finish in 2012, having started construction in 2009. Earthworks were largely completed by April 2012 but structures had not commenced as of that time. In mid-2013, works had begun again, but as of December 2016, problems with funding have kept the road largely behind schedule. The section from the Preveza - Aktio tunnel to Vonitsa and the section from Ionia Odos to Loutraki (also known as Amfilochia bypass), have been opened to traffic in 2019 and 2022 respectively. The final section from Loutraki to Vonitsa was completed and opened to traffic in 2024.

===A6 (Attiki Odos)===

The A6 motorway, or Attiki Odos, forms part of the urban motorway network of Athens&#x27;s metropolitan area. Its full length is and it is also planned to be extended to various directions, bringing its total length to . The Attiki Odos has various auxiliary routes, namely the Aigaleo Ring Road (A65) and the Hymettus Ring Road (A62), serving parts of western and eastern Athens respectively; while the 6 km (4 mi) section leading from the main route to the Athens International Airport is numbered as the A64.
* The A62 motorway is a section of the Attiki Odos which branches off the main A6 route. It is referred to as the Hymettus Beltway (A62) (Greek: Περιφερειακή Υμηττού), serving parts of eastern Athens, while it is also expected to be extended further southwards to Elliniko and further eastwards towards Rafina.
* The A64 motorway is a section of the Attiki Odos which branches off at the end of the main A6 route. It basically serves as a corridor from Attiki Odos and Koropi towards the Athens International Airport.
* The A65 motorway is a second auxiliary route that branches off the main A6 route. The A64 section of the Attiki Odos is referred to as the Aigaleo Ring Road (A65) (Greek: Περιφερειακή Αιγάλεω) and serves parts of western Athens. A small part of the A65, the Skaramagas interchange, remains unfinished, with completion expected by 2028.
* The A621 motorway is a small branch of Attiki Odos which connects Attiki Odos with the Hymettus Ring Road. It serves as a small detour of the main route and its length is .

===A7 (Corinth–Tripoli–Kalamata)===

The A7 motorway starts from Corinth, at the interchange with the A8 motorway and continues to Kalamata, passing through Tripoli. It replaced the old GR-7 as the main road, with the section between Corinth and Tripoli, constructed between 1984 and 1990 and officially becoming part of the Greek road network in 1992.

The A7 has recently undergone extensive improvement to full motorway standards. As of December 2012, the motorway section between Corinth and Kalamata is fully constructed and operational. Its total length is 205 kilometers or 127 miles.

* The A71 motorway is a branch of the A7 (Moreas) from Lefktro, connecting it with Sparta. It was opened on 18 April 2016.

===A8 (Olympia Odos)===
A8 motorway, also known as the Olympia Odos, is the motorway from Athens to Patras. It begins in Elefsina, at the interchange with the A6 (Attiki Odos) and ends at the A5 (Ionia Odos) interchange in Patras.

The Elefsina–Corinth section has been completed to motorway standards, while the Corinth – Patras section begun construction in 2008, and was due to be completed in 2012. After construction works had begun again the whole motorway was completed in 2017. It includes the widening and general reconstruction of the GR-8A along with some new tunnels and bridges.

===A90 (Northern Crete motorway)===
A90 motorway is a temporary name for a motorway under construction in Crete. It is more widely known as North Road Axis of Crete (, BOAK) and is Greece&#x27;s only motorway that is not on its mainland, but on an island. Certain parts have already been completed, as of summer 2007, such as the bypasses at Heraklion, Rethymno and Chania. In late 2014, the Agios Nikolaos - Kalo Chorio part (which also serves as a bypass of Agios Nikolaos) was opened to traffic. Its full length will be 310 kilometres or 193 miles from Sitia in the east to Kissamos in the west, and it is expected to be completed by the year 2031.

=== Electronic toll system and interoperability ===
On April 4, 2018, an international tender was launched by the Greek government for the Εxpression of Ιnterest for the procurement, design and installation of a satellite and electronic toll system (e-tolls) in the Greek motorways, using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) and GNSS technologies. The new system would be the first distance-based pricing model in Greece, replacing the existing toll plazas and charging vehicles depending on the distance covered in the entirety of the country’s motorway network (including the currently state-owned Egnatia Odos).The project&#x27;s cost was estimated at about €400 million.

The system would be double; Passenger vehicles&#x27; license plates would automatically be captured and identified by traffic cameras upon their entrance and exit from the tolled motorway network with the use of ANPR technology, while professional and heavy vehicles would all carry transponders which would monitor and record their position using satellites (GNSS technology). 5 contenders participated in the tender, namely Aκtor SA – Intrakat – Intrasoft Int’l SA- Autostrade Tech S.p.A., Mytilineos – Nusz, Terna – Vinci – Kapsch TrafficCom, OTE – T-Systems International GmbH and STRABAG – SkyToll. In May 2019, the second phase of the tender was completed and two consortiums passed, Aκtor SA – Intrakat – Intrasoft Int’l SA- Autostrade Tech S.p.A. and Mytilineos – Nusz. Finally, a week before the legislative election of July 2019, the then Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Networks Christos Spirtzis appointed concessionaire the consortium of Aκtor SA – Intrakat – Intrasoft Int’l SA- Autostrade Tech S.p.A., after evaluation of the financial offers.

==== Cancellation of the first tender ====
Although the tender for the new system had been strongly disputed by the contestants themselves, the then Minister Ch. Spirtzis of Syriza decided to proceed with it. The concerns regarded the subject of the tender itself, as such a wide implementation does not exist in any developed country, as well as the absence of an agreement for the implementation of such a system. Moreover, existing concession agreements with the private companies managing most of the Greek motorways would have to be amended.

In the autumn of 2019, the tender for the electronic toll system was cancelled by the Council of State following the discovery of several deficiencies and an appeal by the Mytilineos – Nusz consortium, second bidder of the tender, and other participants regarding the bid evaluation procedure, noting that its bid was not preferred although it was lower by €70 million. The tender was officially cancelled at the end of May 2020.

==== Interoperability ====
From March 2011, five (Attiki Odos SA, Aegean Motorway SA, Olympia Odos SA, Moreas SA, Gefyra SA) of the total of seven operating concessionaires of the Greek motorways are part of an interoperable network named &quot;GRITS&quot; (Greek Interoperable Toll Service), which allows drivers to travel along the participating motorways, passing from the electronic toll lanes, using a single transponder.

In October 2019, it was agreed that the remaining two concessionaires (Nea Odos SA and Kentriki Odos SA), as well as the currently state-owned Egnatia Odos SA, would join the GRITS network. Drivers will therefore be able to travel and pay tolls electronically using a single transponder across the entire Greek motorway network. In the autumn of 2019 technical discussions began between all the companies, testing of the system began in the summer of 2020 and it is expected to become operational in the autumn of 2020.

==National Roads==

The National Roads in Greece (Greek: Εθνικές Οδοί) are single carriageway or limited-access roads with one or two traffic lanes for each direction, usually with an emergency lane on each side as well.

* Additional National Roads according to the register of the National Roads 1998
== Current construction projects in Greece ==

As of autumn 2017, most motorway construction projects all over Greece are completed. 
* Part of the A3 motorway was completed in late 2017 at a cost of 1,4 bn euros.
* The A5 motorway (Ionia Odos) and A8 motorway (Olympia Odos) motorways were both finished and opened to traffic in mid-2017 at a cost of 2,2 bn euros and 1,118 bn euros respectively.
* The A7 motorway was completed in November 2016, costing a total of 1 bn euros.
* The final construction point of the A1 motorway at the Vale of Tempe opened to traffic in April 2017, costing 1,3 bn euros.

== Correlation with European routes ==

This is a list of European routes that shows which parts of them run through Greece.

Major routes:

Other routes:
Note: When certain highways that carry European routes are replaced with motorways, the European routes will be reassigned to the new motorways. For example, GR-7 carried the E65 from Tripoli to Kalamata. When the A7 motorway was completed, the E65 numbering was reassigned to it.

<text>Mack Lobell (1984–2016) was a brown racing trotter by Mystic Park out of Matina Hanover by Speedy Count.

He won $3,917,594 during his career and was elected Harness Horse of the Year in 1987 and 1988. Among his many stakes victories were the Yonkers Trot, the Hambletonian, the Elitloppet (twice), the Breeders Crown events for three-year-old and for four-year-old trotters, and the International Trot. His best time of 1:52.1 for the mile was taken as a three-year-old in a race in Springfield, Illinois; this time set the world record for trotters. John Campbell described him as the best horse he has driven.

==1986 season==
In 1986 Mack Lobell won the Breeders Crown, set world records at Delaware and Lexington and finished second in the Peter Haughton Memorial. He was voted 2-Year Old Trotter of the Year.

==1987 season==
Before the 1987 Hambletonian Mack Lobell had run a world 2yo record for trotters in 1986, and had begun 1987 by winning the Yonkers Trot in equal world record time for his age on a half mile track and setting a Meadowlands track record by winning the Beacon Course Trot. In the Hambletonian Mack Lobell broke the stakes record in both heats winning in 1.54 and 1.53 3/5 beating the other heat winner Napoletano by 6 1/4 lengths despite foot soreness.

After his wins in the Yonkers Trot and The Hambletonian Mack Lobell had the chance to win the Triple Crown by winning the Kentucky Futurity. However, after he broke stride in both heats of the World Trotting Derby at Du Quoin won by Napoletano the task looked more difficult. In the Kentucky Futurity at Lexington Mack Lobell and Napoletano each won a division of the first heat. In the second heat Mack Lobell was defeated by Napoletano after setting a slow pace therefore failing to become the first trotter since 1972 to win the Triple Crown. Toward the end of the season Mack Lobell won the Breeders Crown at Pompano Park by 12 3/4 lengths from Napoletano in a time of 1.54 4/5 shattering the previous world record for a 5/8 mile track of 1.57. He also won the Colonial Trot in addition to his Beacon Course, Yonkers Trot, Hambletonian and Breeders Crown wins and world record mile at Springfield and was named Harness Horse of the Year for 1988 with 13 wins from 16 starts and $1.2m in earnings.

==1988 season==
Mack Lobell won the Elitloppet in Sweden early in 1988 beating another American trotter Sugarcane Hanover. In his Elitlopp win he trotted the fastest mile outside North America. Returning to the United States he won a leg of the Statue Of Liberty series, the Nat Ray Trot, the Breeders Crown, International Trot, Challenge Cup and Van Lennep Memorial. In the International Trot he beat opponents from six countries and set a Yonkers track record for the 1 1/4 mile distance in becoming the first American winner of the race since 1980. In a leg of the Statue of Liberty Series at The Meadowlands he broke the world record for 1 1/8 miles. Late in 1988 he finished third behind Sugarcane Hanover and French trotter Ourasi in the March Of Dimes Trot at Garden State Park in a field that also included Napoletano and European trotter Callit and Canada&#x27;s No Sex Please. His 17 wins from 19 starts were sufficient for him to be named Harness Horse of the Year

Early on, Mack Lobell was managed by Chuck Sylvester, and almost always had John Campbell as his driver, but after his performances in Europe at the age of four he was sold to Swedish trainer and breeder John-Eric Magnusson for a reported $6m. In Sweden Mack Lobell continued his successful career, although the primary intention behind bringing the horse to Sweden was for breeding purposes. While racing in Europe he won races in Sweden, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Finland.

==1989 &amp; 1990 seasons==
In 1989 Mack Lobell raced mainly in Europe with wins in the Hugo Abergs Memorial in Sweden, the Campionato Europeo in Italy, the GP von Bild in Germany and the Momarken Grand Prix in Norway. He was also mixing racing with breeding duties He returned to the United States for the International trot but was only third to Kit Lobell. After the International Trot John Campbell was replaced as driver and Mack Lobell won the Challenge Cup for a second time.

In 1990 he won the Elitloppet for a second time. He also won the St Michel Ajo in Finland, the Kosters Memorial in Denmark and a second GP von Bild in Germany.

Mack Lobell didn&#x27;t come close to duplicating his racing success at stud. Mack Lobell died in Sweden in 2016.

<text>The Republican National Committee (RNC) is the primary committee of the Republican Party of the United States. Its members are chosen by the state delegations at the national convention every four years. It is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican brand and political platform, as well as assisting in fundraising and election strategy. It does not have direct authority over elected officials. It is also responsible for organizing and running the Republican National Convention. When a Republican is president, the White House controls the committee. According to Boris Heersink, &quot;political scientists have traditionally described the parties&#x27; national committees as inconsequential but impartial service providers.&quot;

Similar committees exist in every U.S. state and most U.S. counties, although in some states party organization is structured by congressional district, allied campaign organizations being governed by a national committee. Michael Whatley is the current committee chairman.

The Democratic Party&#x27;s counterpart to the RNC is the Democratic National Committee.

==History==
The 1856 Republican National Convention appointed the first RNC. It consisted of one member from each state and territory to serve for four years. Each national committee since then has followed the precedent of equal representation for each state or territory, regardless of population. From 1924 to 1952, there was a national committeeman and national committeewoman from each state and U.S. possession, and from Washington, D.C. In 1952, committee membership was expanded to include the state party chairs of states that voted Republican in the preceding presidential election, have a Republican majority in their congressional delegation (U.S. representatives and senators), or have Republican governors. By 1968, membership reached 145. As of 2011, the RNC has 168 members.

While a number of the chairs of the RNC have been state governors, the only person to have chaired the RNC and later become U.S. president is George H. W. Bush. During Bush&#x27;s time as RNC chair, Spiro Agnew was being investigated for corruption, which would later lead to Agnew&#x27;s resignation as vice president. Bush assisted, at the request of Nixon and Agnew, in getting John Glenn Beall Jr., the U.S. Senator from Maryland, to pressure his brother, George Beall the U.S. Attorney in Maryland, to shut down the investigation into Agnew. Attorney Beall ignored the pressure.

In 2013, the RNC began an outreach campaign towards the American youth and minority voters, after studies showed these groups generally perceived that the Republican Party did not care about their concerns.

During the presidency of Donald Trump, the RNC showed staunch loyalty to President Trump, even at times when prominent Republicans did not. Under Ronna McDaniel&#x27;s leadership, the RNC ran ads for Trump&#x27;s 2020 campaign as early as 2018, put numerous Trump campaign workers and affiliates on the RNC payroll, spent considerable funds at Trump-owned properties, covered his legal fees in the Russian interference investigation, hosted Trump&#x27;s Fake News Awards, and criticized Trump critics within the Republican Party. Two days after the January 6th riot at the Capitol following the controversial 2020 presidential election results, the RNC held an event where members expressed loyalty to the President.

In February 2022, the RNC censured two Republican representatives, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, for their participation in the United States House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the US Capitol; the censure statement described the committee as a &quot;Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse.&quot; The censure of sitting congressmembers, and particularly the description of the January 6 events as &quot;legitimate political discourse&quot;, received bipartisan criticism from politicians and media.

In May 2024, &quot;The Associated Press&quot; reported that under Lara Trump, the RNC had &quot;sought alliances with election deniers, conspiracy theorists and alt-right advocates the party had previously kept at arm&#x27;s length.&quot; It also noted the prevalence of election deniers had increased among top Republican officeholders and RNC officials as part of a larger election denial movement in the United States.

==Role==
The Republican National Committee&#x27;s main function is to assist the Republican Party of the United States. It helps to promote the Republican political platform and the &quot;party brand&quot; or image. It is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy. 

It helps coordinate fundraising and election strategy, as well as organizing and running the Republican National Convention.

According to Jim Nicholson, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee: “The party can’t coordinate with these Super PACs and neither can the campaigns so there’s a lot more chaos . . . .And the party structure clearly has a diminished role because they don’t have the resources they used to have.” 

==Organization==
 the Republican National Committee has been co-chaired by KC Crosbie and Michael Whatley.

The previous chair of the Republican National Committee was Ronna McDaniel, serving from 2017 to 2024. McDaniel was chair of the Michigan Republican Party from 2015 to 2017.

In January 2019, Thomas O. Hicks Jr. was elected co-chairman of the RNC. Hicks has a strong connection to former President Trump&#x27;s campaigns and policy initiatives, having served as chairman of the America First Action PAC and America First Policies, and as national finance co-chairman for Donald J. Trump for President.

Similar committees to the RNC exist in each U.S. state and most U.S. counties. The RNC also organizes volunteer groups for specific interests, such as the Black Republican Activists, GOP Hispanics, RNC Women (not to be confused with National Federation of Republican Women), GOP Faith, Asian Pacific Americans, Young Leaders, and Veterans &amp; Military Families.

On announcing his candidacy to succeed RNC Chairman Duncan, former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele described the party as being at a crossroads and not knowing what to do. &quot;I think I may have some keys to open the door, some juice to turn on the lights,&quot; he said.

Six people ran for the 2009 RNC Chairmanship: Steele, Ken Blackwell, Mike Duncan, Saul Anuzis, Katon Dawson and Chip Saltsman. After Saltsman&#x27;s withdrawal, there were only five candidates during the hotly contested balloting January 30, 2009.

After the third round of balloting that day, Steele held a small lead over incumbent Mike Duncan of Kentucky, with 51 votes to Duncan&#x27;s 44. Shortly after the announcement of the standings, Duncan dropped out of contention without endorsing a candidate. Ken Blackwell, the only other African-American candidate, dropped out after the fourth ballot and endorsed Steele, though Blackwell had been the most socially conservative of the candidates and Steele had been accused of not being &quot;sufficiently conservative.&quot; Steele picked up Blackwell&#x27;s votes. After the fifth round, Steele held a ten-vote lead over Katon Dawson, with 79 votes, and Saul Anuzis dropped out. After the sixth vote, he won the chairmanship of the RNC over Dawson by a vote of 91 to 77.

Mississippi Governor and former RNC chair Haley Barbour has suggested the party will focus its efforts on congressional and gubernatorial elections in the coming years rather than the next presidential election. &quot;When I was chairman of the Republican National Committee the last time we lost the White House in 1992 we focused exclusively on 1993 and 1994. And at the end of that time, we had both houses of Congress with Republican majorities, and we&#x27;d gone from 17 Republican governors to 31. So anyone talking about 2012 today doesn&#x27;t have their eye on the ball. What we ought to worry about is rebuilding our party over the next year and particularly in 2010,&quot; Barbour said at the November 2008 Republican Governors conference.

====2011 election====
Michael Steele ran for re-election at the 2011 RNC winter meeting. Other candidates were Reince Priebus, Republican Party of Wisconsin Chairman, Ann Wagner, former Ambassador to Luxembourg, Saul Anuzis, former Republican Party Chairman of Michigan, and Maria Cino, former acting Secretary of Transportation under George W. Bush. Steele&#x27;s critics increasingly called on him to step down as RNC Chair when his term ended in 2011. A debate for Chairman hosted by Americans for Tax Reform took place on January 3 at the National Press Club. The election for Chairman took place January 14 at the RNC&#x27;s winter meeting with Reince Priebus winning on the seventh ballot after Steele and Wagner withdrew.

: Candidate won majority of votes in the round
: Candidate secured a plurality of votes in the round
: Candidate withdrew

====2013–2023 elections====
Priebus won re-election with near unanimity in the party&#x27;s 2013 meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was re-elected to a third term in 2015, setting him up to become the longest serving head of the party ever.

After winning in November 2016, President-elect Donald Trump designated Priebus as his White House Chief of Staff, to begin upon his taking office in January 2017; David Bossie of Maryland was seen as a potential next RNC chairman.

Trump then recommended Ronna Romney McDaniel as RNC Chairwoman and she was elected to that role by the RNC in January 2017. McDaniel was re-elected in 2019 and 2021. Mike Lindell announced that he would challenge McDaniel in 2023. Lindell accused McDaniel of not denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election forcefully enough, and criticized her for presiding over the RNC during three disappointing election years. McDaniel was re-elected in to a fourth term in January 2023, easily defeating Lindell and California RNC committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon.
 Candidate won majority of votes in the round

==== 2024 election ====
On February 6, 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that McDaniel intended to resign after the South Carolina Republican presidential primary held on February 24, 2024, following dissatisfaction from former president Donald Trump, who publicly supported North Carolina Republican Party chair Michael Whatley.

McDaniel confirmed these reports when, on February 26, 2024, she and Drew McKissick announced their resignations as chair and co-chair of the RNC effective on March 8, 2024. Later that same day, Michael Whatley, chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, announced that he would seek the position of RNC chair. 

Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of former president Donald Trump, also announced on February 28 that she would seek to succeed McKissick as co-chair of the RNC. Both Whatley and Trump gained the endorsement of former President Trump.

Whatley and Trump were both elected via acclamation as chair and vice-chair of the Republican National Committee on March 8, 2024.

==== 2025 election ====
Whatley was reelected as RNC chair on January 17, 2025, and KC Crosbie, whom Donald Trump endorsed, was elected as co-chair, after Lara Trump chose not to continue in the role.

==Current Republican National Committee members==
A collapsible list of the voting members of the Republican National Committee follows, . The state chair, national committeeman and national committeewoman each receive one vote at RNC meetings and vote for RNC Chairmanship.


==Para Bellum Labs==
In February 2014, during the chairmanship of Reince Priebus, the RNC launched an in-house technology incubator called Para Bellum Labs. This new unit of the RNC was first headed by Azarias Reda, an engineer with a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan. The effort is designed to help the party and its candidates bridge the technology gap. Para Bellum, translated from Latin, means &quot;prepare for war.&quot;

==Federal &quot;pay-to-play&quot; investigation==
In September 2019, McDaniel emailed Doug Manchester, whose nomination to become Ambassador to the Bahamas was stalled in the Senate, asking for $500,000 in donations to the Republican Party. Manchester responded, noting that his wife had given $100,000 and that his family would &quot;respond&quot; once he was confirmed by the Republican-led Senate to the ambassadorship. Manchester copied the email to aides of two U.S. senators whose support he needed to win confirmation. CBS News described McDaniel&#x27;s action as a &quot;possible pay-for-play scheme&quot; for the ambassadorship. &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; reported in May 2021 that a federal grand jury had issued a subpoena in a criminal investigation into Manchester&#x27;s nomination, apparently focused on the RNC, McDaniel and RNC co-chair Tommy Hicks, &quot;and possibly members of Congress&quot;. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; reported the investigation began in 2020.

<doc id="326352" wikidata="Q700517" url="?curid=326352" title="Liebig's Extract of Meat Company">
<text>Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat Company, established in the United Kingdom, was the producer of LEMCO brand Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat and the originator of Oxo meat extracts and Oxo beef stock cubes. It was named after Justus &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Liebig, the 19th-century German organic chemist who developed and promoted a method for industrial production of beef extract.

==Early development==

In 1847, Justus &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Liebig developed a concentrated beef extract in hopes of providing a cheap and nutritious meat substitute, &quot;Extractum carnis Liebig&quot;, for those unable to afford the real thing. His method was to trim the fat from the meat, break the meat into small particles, boil it with water to form a liquid of 6-8% solids, and then stir it over low heat, until it was reduced to a paste of 80% solids.
However, in Europe meat was too expensive to profitably supply the necessary raw materials to create the extract.

&quot;Freiherr&quot; (Baron) von Liebig made his process public, publishing the details in 1847. Liebig clearly stated of his process that &quot;the benefit of it should ... be placed at the command of as large a number of persons as possible by the extension of the manufacture, and consequently a reduction in the cost.&quot; A variety of companies produced small batches of meat extract based on Liebig&#x27;s ideas, often using his name on their products.

In 1862, George Christian Giebert, a young German railway engineer visiting Europe, read Liebig&#x27;s &quot;Familiar Letters on Chemistry&quot;. Convinced that the process could be industrialized, he wrote to Liebig to suggest opening a manufacturing plant in South America. Using the flesh of cattle that, before the popularity of canning or freezing meat, would otherwise have been killed for their hides alone, he hoped to produce meat extract at one third of the European cost. He visited Max Joseph von Pettenkofer&#x27;s Royal Pharmacy in Munich, and Friedrich Mohr&#x27;s laboratory in Koblenz, where small amounts of extract were being produced.

With Liebig&#x27;s agreement, and the backing of a group of entrepreneurs and ranchers, Giebert established the &quot;Societé de Fray Bentos Giebert &amp; Cie.&quot;, and built a test extraction plant at Villa Independencia, Uruguay, later called Fray Bentos. By the end of 1864, 50,000 pounds of extract worth £12,000 had been exported and sold. In 1865, Giebert offered Liebig a directorship of the company, with an initial cash payment and an annual salary. The Liebig Extract of Meat Company was established on 4 December 1865 in London with a capital of £150,000. Liebig performed and supervised quality control testing on the product arriving to Europe, in Antwerp, and promoted it as &quot;the real&quot; Liebig extract of meat. By partnering with Liebig, Giebert was able to claim that he was the officially sanctioned producer of Liebig&#x27;s meat extract.

Other companies also used the name &quot;Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat&quot; to market meat extracts. In Britain, a competitor&#x27;s right to use Liebig&#x27;s name was successfully defended on the grounds that the name had fallen into general use and become a generic term before the creation of any particular company. The judge asserted that &quot;Purchasers must use their eyes&quot;, and considered the presentation of the products to be sufficiently different to enable the discriminating consumer to determine which of the products bore Liebig&#x27;s signature and was supported by &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Liebig himself. In response, the company adopted the name &quot;LEMCO&quot; in Britain, displayed it prominently on their products &quot;to correct the evil of substitution&quot;, and encouraged shoppers specifically to request the new trademark &quot;to protect you from inferior substitutes.&quot;

==Products==

Liebig&#x27;s meat extract is a molasses-like black spread packaged in an opaque white glass bottle, which contains reduced meat stock and salt (4%). The ratio of meat to meat extract is generally reported to be about 30 to 1: it takes 30 kg of meat to make 1 kg of extract. The extract was originally promoted for its supposed curative powers and nutritional value as a cheap, nutritious alternative to real meat. However (wrote Mark R. Finlay), beginning in mid-1865 A German physiologist found that dogs died if fed exclusively on extract of meat. As research brought its nutritional value into question, its convenience and flavourfulness were emphasized, and it was marketed as a comfort food. Liebig and his supporters admitted the extract contained virtually no fats and proteins, but said the purpose of the process was to extract flavour. In a change of marketing strategy, it was promoted as a stimulant.

The product enjoyed immense popularity and became a staple in middle-class European households. By the late 1860s, St. Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in London reportedly used 12,000 pots per year of the easily digestible substance. By 1875, 500 tonnes of the extract were being produced at the Fray Bentos plant each year. It was recommended for soldiers during the American Civil War for its shelf stability, ease of transport, and ease of use. It was still used by the Allied forces in World War II. Welsh adventurer Sir Henry Morton Stanley valued it on his trip to Africa. It is still sold by Liebig Benelux.

In 1873, Liebig&#x27;s began producing tinned corned beef, which it sold under the label &quot;Fray Bentos&quot;. &quot;Fray Bentos&quot; was trademarked by Liebig in 1881 to market &quot;Fray Bentos Compressed Cooked Corned Beef&quot;. With the introduction of freezer units, the company was eventually able to produce and export frozen and chilled raw meat as well. The amount of food processed and shipped around the world caused the town of Fray Bentos to be called &quot;The Kitchen of the World&quot;.

Fray Bentos canned meats, now owned by Baxters, are still sold in Europe. The brand also offers meat pies, which have been manufactured since 1958.

The British tonic wine Wincarnis originally contained Liebig&#x27;s meat extract and was initially called Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat and Malt Wine. Beaufoy &amp; Co of Lambeth also produced a meat and malt tonic wine (with quinine) using Liebig&#x27;s meat extract.

The company also worked with English chemist Henry Enfield Roscoe to develop a cheaper meat extract product which it commercialized some years after Liebig&#x27;s death. &quot;Oxo&quot; was registered as a trade mark in many countries. Originally a liquid, Oxo was released as a bouillon cube in 1911.

Liebig also produced a line of biological products under the Oxoid name (starting in 1924), in particular glandular extracts and later dehydrated culture media.

==Fray Bentos industrial complex==
The works and yards at the Fray Bentos factory complex in Fray Bentos in Uruguay ranked among the largest industrial complexes in South America and helped usher in the industrial revolution there. The city of Fray Bentos grew simultaneously with the factory. The plant played a major role in the development of Uruguay&#x27;s cattle sector, which is still one of the country&#x27;s main sources of export products. It attracted many European immigrants and, in its heyday, had 5,000 employees. It is said that an animal was processed every five minutes. Every part of the animal was used.

The Liebig Football Club of Fray Bentos, later renamed Club Atlético Anglo, was established in 1905.

In 1964, a typhoid outbreak in Aberdeen was traced to Fray Bentos corned beef. Investigations into the 1964 Aberdeen typhoid outbreak revealed that the cooling water used in the canning process at the plant was not being consistently chlorinated. Meanwhile, Britain&#x27;s entry into the Common Market affected trade patterns. These factors combined had a serious negative impact on sales, and, in 1971, the complex was given to the Uruguayan government. The plant&#x27;s viability never recovered and production ceased completely in 1979, a major blow to the area&#x27;s residents.

==Corporate history==

In the 1920s, the Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat Company acquired the Oxo Tower Wharf on the south bank of the river Thames in London. There they erected a factory, demolishing most of the original building and preserving and building upon the riverside frontage.

The Liebig Extract of Meat Company was acquired by the Vestey Group in 1924 and the factory was renamed Frigorífico Anglo del Uruguay, also known as El Anglo. The company&#x27;s assets included over 2-3 million hectares of farm land and herds of cattle in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Southern Rhodesia, Kenya and South Africa. Liebig merged with Brooke Bond in 1968, which was in turn acquired by Unilever in 1984; Campbell Soup Company acquired Liebig, Oxo, and several European brands from Unilever in 2001, Campbell later sold the UK operation to Premier Foods in 2006. The rest of Campbell European soup business was sold to CVC Capital Partners and became Continental Foods in 2013. Continental Foods was later acquired by Spanish food company GBFoods in 2019.

Liebig division in France was separated from Brooke Bond Liebig in 1983 and merged with Maille as SEGMA Liebig Maille which was owned by Danone. Danone later broke up SEGMA and sold Liebig France to Campbell Soup Company in 1997.

In the meantime, Oxoid had moved to its own facilities in Basingstoke. Oxoid was purchased by Unilever and joined their Medical Products group as Unipath. In 1997, Oxoid became independent through management buy-out and in 2000, PPMVentures, a subsidiary of Prudential Plc, bought a majority stake. In 2004, Oxoid Ltd was purchased by Fisher Scientific with the Oxoid board of directors sharing £30 million in cash and company shares. Following the merger of Fisher Scientific with Thermo Electron Corporation in November 2006, Oxoid Ltd (along with Remel Inc) became the Microbiology Division of Thermo Fisher Scientific.

==&quot;Museo de la Revolución Industrial&quot;==
The &quot;Museo de la Revolución Industrial&quot; (Museum of the Industrial Revolution) is housed in the former works and yards at Fray Bentos. Thousands of people worked in the Frigorífico Anglo del Uruguay (&quot;El Anglo&quot;), which increased and diversified the use of agricultural products. When it was shut down, the municipality decided to create a museum which would display the original machinery, as well as social and cultural artifacts of the technological revolution in Fray Bentos. Dr. Sue Millar, president of the International Cultural Tourism Committee (ICOMOS), said: “Thus there is the chance to save time and massive expenditure on conservation, to retain the exceptional scope and variety of the 19th and 20th century British manufacturing and engineering machinery.” The site has been proposed as a possible UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The museum is open for tourism and education, displaying the machinery used in the meat and extract of meat processing, the buildings, an 1893 Merryweather water pumping machine, a complete canning plant, a meat-cooking plant, and laboratory full of chemicals and chemistry jars, flasks and stoves. The museum collection contains hundred of photos and glass negatives detailing working life at Liebig&#x27;s.

==Cookbooks==

Liebig&#x27;s company worked with popular cookery writers in various countries to popularize their products. German cookery writer Henriette Davidis wrote recipes for &quot;Improved and Economic Cookery&quot; and other cookbooks. Katharina Prato wrote an Austria-Hungarian recipe book, &quot;Die Praktische Verwerthung Kochrecepte&quot; (1879). Hannah M. Young was commissioned in England to write a cookbook for the Liebig Company. Her popular cookbook, &quot;The Liebig Company&#x27;s Practical Cookery Book&quot;, was published in 1893. In the United States, Maria Parloa extolled the benefits of Liebig&#x27;s extract. Following a product name change Eva Tuite published “Lemco Dishes for all Seasons, containing 208 recipes for each month, with invalid dishes, breakfast dishes, sweets and 75 menus for breakfasts, lunches and Dinners in circa 1900.

==Trading card sets==
Colourful calendars and trading cards were also marketed to popularize the product. Liebig produced many illustrated advertising products: table cards, menu cards, children&#x27;s games, free trading card sets, calendars, posters, poster stamps, paper and other toys. In 1872, they began to include sets of trading cards featuring stories, historical tidbits, geographic tidbits, and so on. Many famous artists were contacted to design those series of cards, which were first produced using true lithography, then litho chromo, chromolithography, and finally offset printing. The cards remain popular with collectors and are often collected in albums.

===&quot;Chimistes Celebres&quot; trading card set===
A set usually consisted of six cards, grouped around a particular theme. This example set includes chemists both ancient and modern. One card features Liebig and his laboratory of students.

<doc id="326356" wikidata="Q5179256" url="?curid=326356" title="Covering lemma">
<text>In the foundations of mathematics, a covering lemma is used to prove that the non-existence of certain large cardinals leads to the existence of a canonical inner model, called the core model, that is, in a sense, maximal and approximates the structure of the von Neumann universe &quot;V&quot;. A covering lemma asserts that under some particular anti-large cardinal assumption, the core model exists and is maximal in a sense that depends on the chosen large cardinal. The first such result was proved by Ronald Jensen for the constructible universe assuming 0# does not exist, which is now known as Jensen&#x27;s covering theorem.

==Example==
For example, if there is no inner model for a measurable cardinal, then the Dodd–Jensen core model, &quot;K&quot;DJ is the core model and satisfies the covering property, that is for every uncountable set &quot;x&quot; of ordinals, there is &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;y&quot; ⊃ &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; has the same cardinality as &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot;DJ. (If 0# does not exist, then &quot;K&quot;DJ = &quot;L&quot;.)

==Versions==
If the core model K exists (and has no Woodin cardinals), then
# If K has no ω1-Erdős cardinals, then for a particular countable (in K) and definable in K sequence of functions from ordinals to ordinals, every set of ordinals closed under these functions is a union of a countable number of sets in K. If L=K, these are simply the primitive recursive functions.
# If K has no measurable cardinals, then for every uncountable set &quot;x&quot; of ordinals, there is &quot;y&quot; ∈ K such that x ⊂ y and |x| = |y|.
# If K has only one measurable cardinal κ, then for every uncountable set x of ordinals, there is y ∈ K[C] such that x ⊂ y and |x| = |y|. Here C is either empty or Prikry generic over K (so it has order type ω and is cofinal in κ) and unique except up to a finite initial segment.
# If K has no inaccessible limit of measurable cardinals and no proper class of measurable cardinals, then there is a maximal and unique (except for a finite set of ordinals) set C (called a system of indiscernibles) for K such that for every sequence S in K of measure one sets consisting of one set for each measurable cardinal, C minus ∪S is finite. Note that every κ \ C is either finite or Prikry generic for K at κ except for members of C below a measurable cardinal below κ. For every uncountable set x of ordinals, there is y ∈ K[C] such that x ⊂ y and |x| = |y|.
# For every uncountable set x of ordinals, there is a set C of indiscernibles for total extenders on K such that there is y ∈ K[C] and x  ⊂ y and |x| = |y|.
# K computes the successors of singular and weakly compact cardinals correctly (Weak Covering Property). Moreover, if |κ| &gt; ω1, then cofinality((κ+)&quot;K&quot;) ≥ |κ|.

==Extenders and indiscernibles==
For core models without overlapping total extenders, the systems of indiscernibles are well understood. Although (if K has an inaccessible limit of measurable cardinals), the system may depend on the set to be covered, it is well-determined and unique in a weaker sense. One application of the covering is counting the number of (sequences of) indiscernibles, which gives optimal lower bounds for various failures of the singular cardinals hypothesis. For example, if K does not have overlapping total extenders, and κ is singular strong limit, and 2κ = κ++, then κ has Mitchell order at least κ++ in K. Conversely, a failure of the singular cardinal hypothesis can be obtained (in a generic extension) from κ with o(κ) = κ++.

For core models with overlapping total extenders (that is with a cardinal strong up to a measurable one), the systems of indiscernibles are poorly understood, and applications (such as the weak covering) tend to avoid rather than analyze the indiscernibles.

==Additional properties==
If K exists, then every regular Jónsson cardinal is Ramsey in K. Every singular cardinal that is regular in K is measurable in K.

Also, if the core model K(X) exists above a set X of ordinals, then it has the above discussed covering properties above X.

<doc id="326357" wikidata="Q407752" url="?curid=326357" title="Neurotoxin">
<text>Neurotoxins are toxins that are destructive to nerve tissue (causing neurotoxicity). Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue. The term can also be used to classify endogenous compounds, which, when abnormally contacted, can prove neurologically toxic. Though neurotoxins are often neurologically destructive, their ability to specifically target neural components is important in the study of nervous systems. Common examples of neurotoxins include lead, ethanol (drinking alcohol), glutamate, nitric oxide, botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox), tetanus toxin, and tetrodotoxin. Some substances such as nitric oxide and glutamate are in fact essential for proper function of the body and only exert neurotoxic effects at excessive concentrations.

Neurotoxins inhibit neuron control over ion concentrations across the cell membrane, or communication between neurons across a synapse. Local pathology of neurotoxin exposure often includes neuron excitotoxicity or apoptosis but can also include glial cell damage. Macroscopic manifestations of neurotoxin exposure can include widespread central nervous system damage such as intellectual disability, persistent memory impairments, epilepsy, and dementia. Additionally, neurotoxin-mediated peripheral nervous system damage such as neuropathy or myopathy is common. Support has been shown for a number of treatments aimed at attenuating neurotoxin-mediated injury, such as antioxidant and antitoxin administration.

==Background==
Exposure to neurotoxins in society is not new, as civilizations have been exposed to neurologically destructive compounds for thousands of years. One notable example is the possible significant lead exposure during the Roman Empire resulting from the development of extensive plumbing networks and the habit of boiling vinegared wine in lead pans to sweeten it, the process generating lead acetate, known as &quot;sugar of lead&quot;. In part, neurotoxins have been part of human history because of the fragile and susceptible nature of the nervous system, making it highly prone to disruption.

The nervous tissue found in the brain, spinal cord, and periphery comprises an extraordinarily complex biological system that largely defines many of the unique traits of individuals. As with any highly complex system, however, even small perturbations to its environment can lead to significant functional disruptions. Properties leading to the susceptibility of nervous tissue include a high surface area of neurons, a high lipid content which retains lipophilic toxins, high blood flow to the brain inducing increased effective toxin exposure, and the persistence of neurons through an individual&#x27;s lifetime, leading to compounding of damages. As a result, the nervous system has a number of mechanisms designed to protect it from internal and external assaults, including the blood brain barrier.

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is one critical example of protection which prevents toxins and other adverse compounds from reaching the brain. As the brain requires nutrient entry and waste removal, it is perfused by blood flow. Blood can carry a number of ingested toxins, however, which would induce significant neuron death if they reach nervous tissue. Thus, protective cells termed astrocytes surround the capillaries in the brain and absorb nutrients from the blood and subsequently transport them to the neurons, effectively isolating the brain from a number of potential chemical insults.

This barrier creates a tight hydrophobic layer around the capillaries in the brain, inhibiting the transport of large or hydrophilic compounds. In addition to the BBB, the choroid plexus provides a layer of protection against toxin absorption in the brain. The choroid plexuses are vascularized layers of tissue found in the third, fourth, and lateral ventricles of the brain, which through the function of their ependymal cells, are responsible for the synthesis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Importantly, through selective passage of ions and nutrients and trapping heavy metals such as lead, the choroid plexuses maintain a strictly regulated environment which contains the brain and spinal cord.

By being hydrophobic and small, or inhibiting astrocyte function, some compounds including certain neurotoxins are able to penetrate into the brain and induce significant damage. In modern times, scientists and physicians have been presented with the challenge of identifying and treating neurotoxins, which has resulted in a growing interest in both neurotoxicology research and clinical studies. Though clinical neurotoxicology is largely a burgeoning field, extensive inroads have been made in the identification of many environmental neurotoxins leading to the classification of 750 to 1000 known potentially neurotoxic compounds. Due to the critical importance of finding neurotoxins in common environments, specific protocols have been developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for testing and determining neurotoxic effects of compounds (USEPA 1998). Additionally, in vitro systems have increased in use as they provide significant improvements over the more common in vivo systems of the past. Examples of improvements include tractable, uniform environments, and the elimination of contaminating effects of systemic metabolism. In vitro systems, however, have presented problems as it has been difficult to properly replicate the complexities of the nervous system, such as the interactions between supporting astrocytes and neurons in creating the BBB. To even further complicate the process of determining neurotoxins when testing in-vitro, neurotoxicity and cytotoxicity may be difficult to distinguish as exposing neurons directly to compounds may not be possible in-vivo, as it is in-vitro. Additionally, the response of cells to chemicals may not accurately convey a distinction between neurotoxins and cytotoxins, as symptoms like oxidative stress or skeletal modifications may occur in response to either.

In an effort to address this complication, neurite outgrowths (either axonal or dendritic) in response to applied compounds have recently been proposed as a more accurate distinction between true neurotoxins and cytotoxins in an in-vitro testing environment. Due to the significant inaccuracies associated with this process, however, it has been slow in gaining widespread support. Additionally, biochemical mechanisms have become more widely used in neurotoxin testing, such that compounds can be screened for sufficiency to induce cell mechanism interference, like the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase capacity of organophosphates (includes parathion and sarin gas). Though methods of determining neurotoxicity still require significant development, the identification of deleterious compounds and toxin exposure symptoms has undergone significant improvement.

==Applications in neuroscience==
Though diverse in chemical properties and functions, neurotoxins share the common property that they act by some mechanism leading to either the disruption or destruction of necessary components within the nervous system. Neurotoxins, however, by their very design can be very useful in the field of neuroscience. As the nervous system in most organisms is both highly complex and necessary for survival, it has naturally become a target for attack by both predators and prey. As venomous organisms often use their neurotoxins to subdue a predator or prey very rapidly, toxins have evolved to become highly specific to their target channels such that the toxin does not readily bind other targets (see Ion Channel toxins). As such, neurotoxins provide an effective means by which certain elements of the nervous system may be accurately and efficiently targeted. An early example of neurotoxin based targeting used radiolabeled tetrodotoxin to assay sodium channels and obtain precise measurements about their concentration along nerve membranes. Likewise through isolation of certain channel activities, neurotoxins have provided the ability to improve the original Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron in which it was theorized that single generic sodium and potassium channels could account for most nervous tissue function. From this basic understanding, the use of common compounds such as tetrodotoxin, tetraethylammonium, and bungarotoxins have led to a much deeper understanding of the distinct ways in which individual neurons may behave.

==Mechanisms of activity==
As neurotoxins are compounds which adversely affect the nervous system, a number of mechanisms through which they function are through the inhibition of neuron cellular processes. These inhibited processes can range from membrane depolarization mechanisms to inter-neuron communication. By inhibiting the ability for neurons to perform their expected intracellular functions, or pass a signal to a neighboring cell, neurotoxins can induce systemic nervous system arrest as in the case of botulinum toxin, or even nervous tissue death. The time required for the onset of symptoms upon neurotoxin exposure can vary between different toxins, being on the order of hours for botulinum toxin and years for lead.

===Inhibitors===

====Sodium channel====

=====Tetrodotoxin=====
Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a poison produced by organisms belonging to the Tetraodontiformes order, which includes the puffer fish, ocean sunfish, and porcupine fish. Within the puffer fish, TTX is found in the liver, gonads, intestines, and skin. TTX can be fatal if consumed, and has become a common form of poisoning in many countries. Common symptoms of TTX consumption include paraesthesia (often restricted to the mouth and limbs), muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting and often manifest within 30 minutes of ingestion. The primary mechanism by which TTX is toxic is through the inhibition of sodium channel function, which reduces the functional capacity of neuron communication. This inhibition largely affects a susceptible subset of sodium channels known as TTX-sensitive (TTX-s), which also happens to be largely responsible for the sodium current that drives the depolarization phase of neuron action potentials. TTX-resistant (TTX-r) is another form of sodium channel which has limited sensitivity to TTX, and is largely found in small diameter axons such as those found in nociception neurons. When a significant level of TTX is ingested, it will bind sodium channels on neurons and reduce their membrane permeability to sodium. This results in an increased effective threshold of required excitatory signals in order to induce an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. The effect of this increased signaling threshold is a reduced excitability of postsynaptic neurons, and subsequent loss of motor and sensory function which can result in paralysis and death. Though assisted ventilation may increase the chance of survival after TTX exposure, there is currently no antitoxin. The use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Neostigmine or the muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist atropine (which will inhibit parasympathetic activity), however, can increase sympathetic nerve activity enough to improve the chance of survival after TTX exposure.

====Potassium channel====

=====Tetraethylammonium=====
Tetraethylammonium (TEA) is a compound that, like a number of neurotoxins, was first identified through its damaging effects to the nervous system and shown to have the capacity of inhibiting the function of motor nerves and thus the contraction of the musculature in a manner similar to that of curare. Additionally, through chronic TEA administration, muscular atrophy would be induced. It was later determined that TEA functions in-vivo primarily through its ability to inhibit both the potassium channels responsible for the delayed rectifier seen in an action potential and some population of calcium-dependent potassium channels. It is this capability to inhibit potassium flux in neurons that has made TEA one of the most important tools in neuroscience. It has been hypothesized that the ability for TEA to inhibit potassium channels is derived from its similar space-filling structure to potassium ions. What makes TEA very useful for neuroscientists is its specific ability to eliminate potassium channel activity, thereby allowing the study of neuron response contributions of other ion channels such as voltage gated sodium channels. In addition to its many uses in neuroscience research, TEA has been shown to perform as an effective treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease through its ability to limit the progression of the disease.

====Chloride channel====

=====Chlorotoxin=====
Chlorotoxin (Cltx) is the active compound found in scorpion venom, and is primarily toxic because of its ability to inhibit the conductance of chloride channels. Ingestion of lethal volumes of Cltx results in paralysis through this ion channel disruption. Similar to botulinum toxin, Cltx has been shown to possess significant therapeutic value. Evidence has shown that Cltx can inhibit the ability for gliomas to infiltrate healthy nervous tissue in the brain, significantly reducing the potential invasive harm caused by tumors.

====Calcium channel====

=====Conotoxin=====
Conotoxins represent a category of poisons produced by the marine cone snail, and are capable of inhibiting the activity of a number of ion channels such as calcium, sodium, or potassium channels. In many cases, the toxins released by the different types of cone snails include a range of different types of conotoxins, which may be specific for different ion channels, thus creating a venom capable of widespread nerve function interruption. One of the unique forms of conotoxins, ω-conotoxin (ω-CgTx) is highly specific for Ca channels and has shown usefulness in isolating them from a system. As calcium flux is necessary for proper excitability of a cell, any significant inhibition could prevent a large amount of functionality. Significantly, ω-CgTx is capable of long term binding to and inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels located in the membranes of neurons but not those of muscle cells.

====Synaptic vesicle release====

=====Botulinum toxin=====
 Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a group of neurotoxins consisting of eight distinct compounds, referred to as BTX-A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, which are produced by the bacterium &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot; and lead to muscular paralysis. A notably unique feature of BTX is its relatively common therapeutic use in treating dystonia and spasticity disorders, as well as in inducing muscular atrophy despite being the most poisonous substance known. BTX functions peripherally to inhibit acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction through degradation of the SNARE proteins required for ACh vesicle-membrane fusion. As the toxin is highly biologically active, an estimated dose of 1μg/kg body weight is sufficient to induce an insufficient tidal volume and resultant death by asphyxiation. Due to its high toxicity, BTX antitoxins have been an active area of research. It has been shown that capsaicin (active compound responsible for heat in chili peppers) can bind the TRPV1 receptor expressed on cholinergic neurons and inhibit the toxic effects of BTX.

=====Tetanus toxin=====
Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) is a compound that functionally reduces inhibitory transmissions in the nervous system resulting in muscular tetany. TeNT is similar to BTX, and is in fact highly similar in structure and origin; both belonging to the same category of clostridial neurotoxins. Like BTX, TeNT inhibits inter-neuron communication by means of vesicular neurotransmitter (NT) release. One notable difference between the two compounds is that while BTX inhibits muscular contractions, TeNT induces them. Though both toxins inhibit vesicle release at neuron synapses, the reason for this different manifestation is that BTX functions mainly in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) while TeNT is largely active in the central nervous system (CNS). This is a result of TeNT migration through motor neurons to the inhibitory neurons of the spinal cord after entering through endocytosis. This results in a loss of function in inhibitory neurons within the CNS resulting in systemic muscular contractions. Similar to the prognosis of a lethal dose of BTX, TeNT leads to paralysis and subsequent suffocation.

====Blood brain barrier====

=====Aluminium=====
Neurotoxic behavior of Aluminium is known to occur upon entry into the circulatory system, where it can migrate to the brain and inhibit some of the crucial functions of the blood brain barrier (BBB). A loss of function in the BBB can produce significant damage to the neurons in the CNS, as the barrier protecting the brain from other toxins found in the blood will no longer be capable of such action. Though the metal is known to be neurotoxic, effects are usually restricted to patients incapable of removing excess ions from the blood, such as those experiencing renal failure. Patients experiencing aluminium toxicity can exhibit symptoms such as impaired learning and reduced motor coordination. Additionally, systemic aluminium levels are known to increase with age, and have been shown to correlate with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, implicating it as a neurotoxic causative compound of the disease. Despite its known toxicity in its ionic form, studies are divided on the potential toxicity of using aluminium in packaging and cooking appliances.

=====Mercury=====
Mercury is capable of inducing CNS damage by migrating into the brain by crossing the BBB. Mercury exists in a number of different compounds, though methylmercury (MeHg), dimethylmercury and diethylmercury are the only significantly neurotoxic forms. Diethylmercury and dimethylmercury are considered some of the most potent neurotoxins ever discovered. MeHg is usually acquired through consumption of seafood, as it tends to concentrate in organisms high on the food chain. It is known that the mercuric ion inhibits amino acid (AA) and glutamate (Glu) transport, potentially leading to excitotoxic effects.

===Receptor agonists and antagonists===

====Anatoxin-a====
Investigations into anatoxin-&quot;a&quot;, also known as &quot;Very Fast Death Factor&quot;, began in 1961 following the deaths of cows that drank from a lake containing an algal bloom in Saskatchewan, Canada. It is a cyanotoxin produced by at least four different genera of cyanobacteria, and has been reported in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand.

Toxic effects from anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; progress very rapidly because it acts directly on the nerve cells (neurons). The progressive symptoms of anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; exposure are loss of coordination, twitching, convulsions and rapid death by respiratory paralysis. The nerve tissues which communicate with muscles contain a receptor called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Stimulation of these receptors causes a muscular contraction. The anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; molecule is shaped so it fits this receptor, and in this way it mimics the natural neurotransmitter normally used by the receptor, acetylcholine. Once it has triggered a contraction, anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; does not allow the neurons to return to their resting state, because it is not degraded by cholinesterase which normally performs this function. As a result, the muscle cells contract permanently, the communication between the brain and the muscles is disrupted and breathing stops.

When it was first discovered, the toxin was called the Very Fast Death Factor (VFDF) because when it was injected into the body cavity of mice it induced tremors, paralysis and death within a few minutes. In 1977, the structure of VFDF was determined as a secondary, bicyclic amine alkaloid, and it was renamed anatoxin-&quot;a&quot;. Structurally, it is similar to cocaine. There is continued interest in anatoxin-&quot;a&quot; because of the dangers it presents to recreational and drinking waters, and because it is a particularly useful molecule for investigating acetylcholine receptors in the nervous system. The deadliness of the toxin means that it has a high military potential as a toxin weapon.

====Bungarotoxin====
Bungarotoxin is a compound with known interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which constitute a family of ion channels whose activity is triggered by neurotransmitter binding. Bungarotoxin is produced in a number of different forms, though one of the commonly used forms is the long chain alpha form, α-bungarotoxin, which is isolated from the banded krait snake. Though extremely toxic if ingested, α-bungarotoxin has shown extensive usefulness in neuroscience as it is particularly adept at isolating nAChRs due to its high affinity to the receptors. As there are multiple forms of bungarotoxin, there are different forms of nAChRs to which they will bind, and α-bungarotoxin is particularly specific for α7-nAChR. This α7-nAChR functions to allow calcium ion influx into cells, and thus when blocked by ingested bungarotoxin will produce damaging effects, as ACh signaling will be inhibited. Likewise, the use of α-bungarotoxin can be very useful in neuroscience if it is desirable to block calcium flux in order to isolate effects of other channels. Additionally, different forms of bungarotoxin may be useful for studying inhibited nAChRs and their resultant calcium ion flow in different systems of the body. For example, α-bungarotoxin is specific for nAChRs found in the musculature and κ-bungarotoxin is specific for nAChRs found in neurons.

=====Caramboxin=====

Caramboxin (CBX) is a toxin found in star fruit (&quot;Averrhoa carambola)&quot;. Individuals with some types of kidney disease are susceptible to adverse neurological effects including intoxication, seizures and even death after eating star fruit or drinking juice made of this fruit. Caramboxin is a new nonpeptide amino acid toxin that stimulate the glutamate receptors in neurons. Caramboxin is an agonist of both NMDA and AMPA glutamatergic ionotropic receptors with potent excitatory, convulsant, and neurodegenerative properties.

=====Curare=====
The term &quot;curare&quot; is ambiguous because it has been used to describe a number of poisons which at the time of naming were understood differently from present day understandings. In the past the characterization has meant poisons used by South American tribes on arrows or darts, though it has matured to specify a specific categorization of poisons which act on the neuromuscular junction to inhibit signaling and thus induce muscle relaxation. The neurotoxin category contains a number of distinct poisons, though all were originally purified from plants originating in South America. The effect with which injected curare poison is usually associated is muscle paralysis and resultant death. Curare notably functions to inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Normally, these receptor channels allow sodium ions into muscle cells to initiate an action potential that leads to muscle contraction. By blocking the receptors, the neurotoxin is capable of significantly reducing neuromuscular junction signaling, an effect which has resulted in its use by anesthesiologists to produce muscular relaxation.

===Cytoskeleton interference===

==== Ammonia ====
Ammonia toxicity is often seen through two routes of administration, either through consumption or through endogenous ailments such as liver failure. One notable case in which ammonia toxicity is common is in response to cirrhosis of the liver which results in hepatic encephalopathy, and can result in cerebral edema (Haussinger 2006). This cerebral edema can be the result of nervous cell remodeling. As a consequence of increased concentrations, ammonia activity in-vivo has been shown to induce swelling of astrocytes in the brain through increased production of cGMP (Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate) within the cells which leads to Protein Kinase G-mediated (PKG) cytoskeletal modifications. The resultant effect of this toxicity can be reduced brain energy metabolism and function. Importantly, the toxic effects of ammonia on astrocyte remodeling can be reduced through administration of L-carnitine. This astrocyte remodeling appears to be mediated through ammonia-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. This mitochondrial transition is a direct result of glutamine activity a compound which forms from ammonia in-vivo. Administration of antioxidants or glutaminase inhibitor can reduce this mitochondrial transition, and potentially also astrocyte remodeling.

====Arsenic====
Arsenic is a neurotoxin commonly found concentrated in areas exposed to agricultural runoff, mining, and smelting sites (Martinez-Finley 2011). One of the effects of arsenic ingestion during the development of the nervous system is the inhibition of neurite growth which can occur both in PNS and the CNS. This neurite growth inhibition can often lead to defects in neural migration, and significant morphological changes of neurons during development,) often leading to neural tube defects in neonates. As a metabolite of arsenic, arsenite is formed after ingestion of arsenic and has shown significant toxicity to neurons within about 24 hours of exposure. The mechanism of this cytotoxicity functions through arsenite-induced increases in intracellular calcium ion levels within neurons, which may subsequently reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential which activates caspases, triggering cell death. Another known function of arsenite is its destructive nature towards the cytoskeleton through inhibition of neurofilament transport. This is particularly destructive as neurofilaments are used in basic cell structure and support. Lithium administration has shown promise, however, in restoring some of the lost neurofilament motility. Additionally, similar to other neurotoxin treatments, the administration of certain antioxidants has shown some promise in reducing neurotoxicity of ingested arsenic.

===Calcium-mediated cytotoxicity===

====Lead====
Lead is a potent neurotoxin whose toxicity has been recognized for at least thousands of years. Though neurotoxic effects for lead are found in both adults and young children, the developing brain is particularly susceptible to lead-induced harm, effects which can include apoptosis and excitotoxicity. An underlying mechanism by which lead is able to cause harm is its ability to be transported by calcium ATPase pumps across the BBB, allowing for direct contact with the fragile cells within the central nervous system. Neurotoxicity results from lead&#x27;s ability to act in a similar manner to calcium ions, as concentrated lead will lead to cellular uptake of calcium which disrupts cellular homeostasis and induces apoptosis. It is this intracellular calcium increase that activates protein kinase C (PKC), which manifests as learning deficits in children as a result of early lead exposure. In addition to inducing apoptosis, lead inhibits interneuron signaling through the disruption of calcium-mediated neurotransmitter release.

===Neurotoxins with multiple effects===

====Ethanol====
As a neurotoxin, ethanol has been shown to induce nervous system damage and affect the body in a variety of ways. Among the known effects of ethanol exposure are both transient and lasting consequences. Some of the lasting effects include long-term reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus, widespread brain atrophy, and induced inflammation in the brain. Of note, chronic ethanol ingestion has additionally been shown to induce reorganization of cellular membrane constituents, leading to a lipid bilayer marked by increased membrane concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat. This is important as neurotransmitter transport can be impaired through vesicular transport inhibition, resulting in diminished neural network function. One significant example of reduced inter-neuron communication is the ability for ethanol to inhibit NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, resulting in reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory acquisition. NMDA has been shown to play an important role in LTP and consequently memory formation. With chronic ethanol intake, however, the susceptibility of these NMDA receptors to induce LTP increases in the mesolimbic dopamine neurons in an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) dependent manner. This reorganization may lead to neuronal cytotoxicity both through hyperactivation of postsynaptic neurons and through induced addiction to continuous ethanol consumption. It has, additionally, been shown that ethanol directly reduces intracellular calcium ion accumulation through inhibited NMDA receptor activity, and thus reduces the capacity for the occurrence of LTP.

In addition to the neurotoxic effects of ethanol in mature organisms, chronic ingestion is capable of inducing severe developmental defects. Evidence was first shown in 1973 of a connection between chronic ethanol intake by mothers and defects in their offspring. This work was responsible for creating the classification of fetal alcohol syndrome, a disease characterized by common morphogenesis aberrations such as defects in craniofacial formation, limb development, and cardiovascular formation. The magnitude of ethanol neurotoxicity in fetuses leading to fetal alcohol syndrome has been shown to be dependent on antioxidant levels in the brain such as vitamin E. As the fetal brain is relatively fragile and susceptible to induced stresses, severe deleterious effects of alcohol exposure can be seen in important areas such as the hippocampus and cerebellum. The severity of these effects is directly dependent upon the amount and frequency of ethanol consumption by the mother, and the stage in development of the fetus. It is known that ethanol exposure results in reduced antioxidant levels, mitochondrial dysfunction (Chu 2007), and subsequent neuronal death, seemingly as a result of increased generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS). This is a plausible mechanism, as there is a reduced presence in the fetal brain of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and peroxidase. In support of this mechanism, administration of high levels of dietary vitamin E results in reduced or eliminated ethanol-induced neurotoxic effects in fetuses.

====n-Hexane====

n-Hexane is a neurotoxin which has been responsible for the poisoning of several workers in Chinese electronics factories in recent years.

===Receptor-selective neurotoxins===

====MPP+====
MPP+, the toxic metabolite of MPTP is a selective neurotoxin which interferes with oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by inhibiting complex I, leading to the depletion of ATP and subsequent cell death. This occurs almost exclusively in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, resulting in the presentation of permanent parkinsonism in exposed subjects 2–3 days after administration.

===Endogenous neurotoxin sources===
Unlike most common sources of neurotoxins which are acquired by the body through ingestion, endogenous neurotoxins both originate from and exert their effects in-vivo. Additionally, though most venoms and exogenous neurotoxins will rarely possess useful in-vivo capabilities, endogenous neurotoxins are commonly used by the body in useful and healthy ways, such as nitric oxide which is used in cell communication. It is often only when these endogenous compounds become highly concentrated that they lead to dangerous effects.

====Nitric oxide====
Though nitric oxide (NO) is commonly used by the nervous system in inter-neuron communication and signaling, it can be active in mechanisms leading to ischemia in the cerebrum (Iadecola 1998). The neurotoxicity of NO is based on its importance in glutamate excitotoxicity, as NO is generated in a calcium-dependent manner in response to glutamate mediated NMDA activation, which occurs at an elevated rate in glutamate excitotoxicity. Though NO facilitates increased blood flow to potentially ischemic regions of the brain, it is also capable of increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage and apoptosis. Thus an increased presence of NO in an ischemic area of the CNS can produce significantly toxic effects.

====Glutamate====
Glutamate, like nitric oxide, is an endogenously produced compound used by neurons to perform normally, being present in small concentrations throughout the gray matter of the CNS. One of the most notable uses of endogenous glutamate is its functionality as an excitatory neurotransmitter. When concentrated, however, glutamate becomes toxic to surrounding neurons. This toxicity can be both a result of direct lethality of glutamate on neurons and a result of induced calcium flux into neurons leading to swelling and necrosis. Support has been shown for these mechanisms playing significant roles in diseases and complications such as Huntington&#x27;s disease, epilepsy, and stroke.

<text>Altdorf () is a municipality in Switzerland. It is the capital of the Swiss canton of Uri and retains historic town privileges. It is the place where, according to the legend, William Tell shot the apple from his son&#x27;s head.

Altdorf is situated on the right (eastern) bank of the Reuss, about south of where the river discharges into the Urnersee, an arm of Lake Lucerne. It is at the junction of two major Alpine passes—Saint Gotthard to the south and the Klausen Pass to the east—and is the last station on the Gotthard railway before the line enters the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the world&#x27;s longest railway tunnel.

The official language of Altdorf is Swiss Standard German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic dialect.

==Geography==

The municipality covers an area of . The town proper sits at an altitude of above sea level on a flat alluvial plain between the right bank of the river Reuss and the steep hillside of the Rossstock to the east. The scattered hamlets and pastureland of Eggbergen, about above the town, also belong to the municipality.

Of Altdorf&#x27;s total area, about 36% is used for agricultural purposes (predominately for orchards or vineyards), 37–39% is forested, 23% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder is rivers, glaciers, or mountains.

Altdorf adjoins the municipalities of Attinghausen and Seedorf across the Reuss to the west, Flüelen, the port village at the Urnersee to the north, Bürglen in the Schächental to the east and south, and Schattdorf to the south.

==History==
The earliest evidence of a settlement in Altdorf are several La Tène era bronze ax-heads and iron tools from the 3rd century BCE. The people that settled in this region initially settled in the forest, and expanded toward the banks of the Reuss. When the Reuss periodically flooded, the low lying settlements were destroyed and the inhabitants were driven back to the &quot;old town&quot;, a possible source of the name Altdorf.

Following the collapse of the Roman Empire the local Gallo-Roman population of Altdorf began to mix with the Germanic Alamanni during the 7th century. The earliest evidence of this is the grave of an armed horseman (dated to 670–680) located in the local St Martin&#x27;s Church.

The current town was first mentioned in 1223 as &quot;Alttorf&quot;, whereas some sources from the 16th to 19th centuries occasionally refer to it as &quot;Uri&quot;.

==Demographics==

Altdorf has a population (as of ) of . As of 2017, 1,347 people or 14.8% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. From 2008 through 2017 the population has increased at an annual rate of 0.8%. Most of the population () speaks German (88.3%), with Serbo-Croatian being second most common (4.2%) and Italian being third ( 2.5%). the gender distribution of the population was 48.4% male and 51.6% female.

In Altdorf about 65.2% of the population (between age 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a ).

Altdorf has an unemployment rate of 1.45%. , there were 137 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 49 businesses involved in this sector. 1,748 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 77 businesses in this sector. 3,585 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 403 businesses in this sector.

===Tell Monument===

According to the legend, Altdorf&#x27;s marketplace is the site where William Tell shot the apple from his son&#x27;s head, and in 1895 sculptor Richard Kissling unveiled a bronze statue commemorating the feat at the foot of an old tower.

In 1899 a theatre was opened close to the town&#x27;s center for the purpose of performing Schiller&#x27;s play of &quot;Wilhelm Tell&quot;.

=== Historisches Museum and the Haus für Kunst Uri ===
In 1905 a Museum was opened on Gottardstrasse just south of the centre of the town that houses a collection of local antiquities, weapons and regional furniture, as well as a collection of portraits of important Uri citizens, including fine ones by the Andermatt-born Felix Maria Diogg (1762–1834). There are several paintings here by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) whose family came from Hospental, including portraits of Pope Pius X, Pope Pius XI, Cardinal Merry del Val, the artist&#x27;s father Alois Muller, his uncle Domherr Josef Muller, and a large allegorical work &quot;Alpenrose und Edelweiss&quot;. The museum was extended in the 1990s.

Recently the town has established the Haus für Kunst Uri at Herrengasse 2 in a partly converted historic house with a large contemporary extension creating an attractive exhibition space. The work of Swiss and international contemporary artists from Uri is exhibited here, and they sometimes have exhibitions of earlier historical art.

<text>Albert Hamilton Gordon (July 21, 1901 – May 1, 2009), was an American businessman who transformed the Wall Street firm of Kidder Peabody. He bought the firm in 1931 and remained its chairman until selling it to General Electric in 1986. He made cold calls to potential clients well into his 90s and continued to come to his office at Deltec Asset Management several times a week until he was over 100.

Past 100 years old he continued to serve as the chairman of the Trollope Society and as chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Roxbury Latin School, having graduated from there in 1919 and served as a Trustee since 1940; among his philanthropic activities were generous donations both to the School and to Harvard University. Unknown to many as a bibliophile, Gordon donated the only surviving copy of John Eliot&#x27;s 1663 “Indian Bible” to Roxbury Latin School

In his latest years Gordon was still actively involved in investments and was bearish on U.S. stocks prior to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
At the time of his death, he was the oldest living alumnus of The Roxbury Latin School, Harvard College and Harvard Business School. He was also a trustee of the New York Road Runners Club.

<text>Rafał Aleksander Ziemkiewicz (born 13 September 1964, in Piaseczno) is a Polish political and science fiction author and right-wing publicist. Winner of the Janusz A. Zajdel Award (1995, 1998 in novels category and 1996 for short stories).

==Biography==

===Science-fiction writer===
In 1984, during his studies at the University of Warsaw (Polish language and literature), he joined SFAN science fiction fan association and started writing short stories. His first science-fiction short story was &quot;Z palcem na spuście&quot; (1982), followed by his book debut &quot;Władca szczurów&quot; (Warsaw) (1987). He also worked for two Polish science-fiction magazines: &quot;Fantastyka&quot; (1986–1990) and as a chief editor for &quot;Fenix&quot; (1990–1994), and collaborated with an underground publishing house &quot;STOP&quot; by distributing its books at the Department of Polish, University of Warsaw. For his novels &quot;Pieprzony los kataryniarza&quot; (1995) and &quot;Walc stulecia&quot; (1998), as well as his short story &quot;&quot; (1996), he was awarded the Zajdel Award, the most prestigious Polish award for science fiction and fantasy literature. He was also awarded Śląkfa for Writer of a Year in 1990 and 1998.

A popular theme in his works is the fate of Poland and more broadly, Europe, in the near future (from several to several dozen years). His books often paint the future in dark colors, showing the Commonwealth of Independent States disintegrate into a civil war, European Union becoming powerless in the face of Islamic terrorism, and predatory capitalism and political correctness taken &quot;ad absurdum&quot; leading to the erosion of morality and ethics. Thus his books are often classified as political fiction and social science fiction, although they are not seen as dystopian fiction.

===Journalist and publicist===
After the fall of communism, Ziemkiewicz became a conservative journalist and essayist. He began this career in the early 1990s as a publicist for Najwyższy Czas! weekly magazine. Until February 1997, Ziemkiewicz wrote political and socio-economical essays for &quot;Gazeta Polska&quot; (1993–1997). He was also a columnist of the Polish magazine &quot;Wprost&quot; (2001–2003) and the Polish edition of &quot;Newsweek&quot; (2003–2007), and occasionally published essays in &quot;Polityka&quot;. Currently his columns are being published in &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;, &quot;Uważam Rze&quot;, &quot;Gazeta Polska&quot;, &quot;Niezależna Gazeta Polska&quot; and Interia.pl webportal. Many of his essays have been collected and published in book format. In 2001 he won the Kisiel Prize.

Ziemkiewicz has worked as a radio journalist, working for Radio WAWA and Polskie Radio Program IV in the 1990s, Radio TOK FM in the early 2000s, later with Radio VOX FM and Program 1 Polskiego Radia. He hosts a television talkshow on TVP Info and a program on TVP Historia.

He was a spokesman for the Real Politics Union (&quot;Unia Polityki Realnej&quot;) party (1993–1994). In 1995, as a stipendiary of the National Forum Foundation he worked for the Republican Party in United States.

In September 2006, Ziemkiewicz published an article in the Polish edition of &quot;Newsweek&quot; criticizing the editor-in-chief of &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, Adam Michnik; Michnik brought a civil suit against Ziemkiewicz, which was settled in 2007 after Ziemkiewicz agreed to publish an apology.

In 2018, he cancelled a planned speaking tour in the UK following appeals by activists and politicians to the Home Office to block his entry due to hate speech concerns. In the wake of the event, Ziemkiewicz tweeted that he would no longer be coming to the UK, describing Britain as “fascist”.

The same year, the Kantor Center at Tel Aviv University published an annual report on antisemitism, which included, among others, Ziemkiewicz&#x27;s statements. According to Ziemkiewicz, he was being regularly included on “Jewish lists”, and from his perspective it was a “professional success - something like winning the &quot;crown of Sinai”. At the same time, he stated that the content of the report that concerned him was untrue. Ziemkiwiecz also attacked Rafał Pankowski, a Polish sociologist and political scientist, by calling him a “snitch”, as he was the one who stood for the Polish part of the report. He also attacked Pankowski on public TV in 2019.

In 2019 during a talk show his statements were judged to be defamatory, but his conviction was overturned by presidential pardon in 2023.

In 2020, he published &quot;Cham niezbuntowany&quot; which some considered antisemitic and instigating hatred. The anti-racist watchdog said that the book contained examples of criminal hate speech, such as when it describes Israeli children as being molded into &quot;killing machines&quot; by &quot;Holocaust, or rather myth of Holocaust&quot; which they interpreted as Holocaust denial. Ziemkiewicz denied the accusations and said that the main themes of his books are completely different. Addressing the accusations, he further stated that he never denied the Holocaust, and that he simply wrote that, in addition to the Holocaust, there is also a myth of the Holocaust. He argued that, if he writes about the myth of the Polish Warsaw Uprising, he is not denying the fact of the Uprising.

<text>Reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics. Its defining method can briefly be described as &quot;going backwards from the theorems to the axioms&quot;, in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. It can be conceptualized as sculpting out necessary conditions from sufficient ones.

The reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and Zorn&#x27;s lemma are equivalent over ZF set theory. The goal of reverse mathematics, however, is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory.

Reverse mathematics is usually carried out using subsystems of second-order arithmetic, where many of its definitions and methods are inspired by previous work in constructive analysis and proof theory. The use of second-order arithmetic also allows many techniques from recursion theory to be employed; many results in reverse mathematics have corresponding results in computable analysis. In &quot;higher-order&quot; reverse mathematics, the focus is on subsystems of higher-order arithmetic, and the associated richer language.

The program was founded by and brought forward by Steve Simpson. A standard reference for the subject is , while an introduction for non-specialists is . An introduction to higher-order reverse mathematics, and also the founding paper, is . A comprehensive introduction, covering major results and methods, is 

== General principles ==
In reverse mathematics, one starts with a framework language and a base theory—a core axiom system—that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in, but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems. For example, to study the theorem “Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a supremum” it is necessary to use a base system that can speak of real numbers and sequences of real numbers.

For each theorem that can be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system, the goal is to determine the particular axiom system (stronger than the base system) that is necessary to prove that theorem. To show that a system &quot;S&quot; is required to prove a theorem &quot;T&quot;, two proofs are required. The first proof shows &quot;T&quot; is provable from &quot;S&quot;; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system &quot;S&quot;. The second proof, known as a reversal, shows that &quot;T&quot; itself implies &quot;S&quot;; this proof is carried out in the base system. The reversal establishes that no axiom system &quot;S′&quot; that extends the base system can be weaker than &quot;S&quot; while still proving &quot;T&quot;.

=== Use of second-order arithmetic ===

Most reverse mathematics research focuses on subsystems of second-order arithmetic. The body of research in reverse mathematics has established that weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic suffice to formalize almost all undergraduate-level mathematics. In second-order arithmetic, all objects can be represented as either natural numbers or sets of natural numbers. For example, in order to prove theorems about real numbers, the real numbers can be represented as Cauchy sequences of rational numbers, each of which sequence can be represented as a set of natural numbers.

The axiom systems most often considered in reverse mathematics are defined using axiom schemes called comprehension schemes. Such a scheme states that any set of natural numbers definable by a formula of a given complexity exists. In this context, the complexity of formulas is measured using the arithmetical hierarchy and analytical hierarchy.

The reason that reverse mathematics is not carried out using set theory as a base system is that the language of set theory is too expressive. Extremely complex sets of natural numbers can be defined by simple formulas in the language of set theory (which can quantify over arbitrary sets). In the context of second-order arithmetic, results such as Post&#x27;s theorem establish a close link between the complexity of a formula and the (non)computability of the set it defines.

Another effect of using second-order arithmetic is the need to restrict general mathematical theorems to forms that can be expressed within arithmetic. For example, second-order arithmetic can express the principle &quot;Every countable vector space has a basis&quot; but it cannot express the principle &quot;Every vector space has a basis&quot;. In practical terms, this means that theorems of algebra and combinatorics are restricted to countable structures, while theorems of analysis and topology are restricted to separable spaces. Many principles that imply the axiom of choice in their general form (such as &quot;Every vector space has a basis&quot;) become provable in weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic when they are restricted. For example, &quot;every field has an algebraic closure&quot; is not provable in ZF set theory, but the restricted form &quot;every countable field has an algebraic closure&quot; is provable in RCA0, the weakest system typically employed in reverse mathematics.

=== Use of higher-order arithmetic ===

A recent strand of &quot;higher-order&quot; reverse mathematics research, initiated by Ulrich Kohlenbach in 2005, focuses on subsystems of higher-order arithmetic.
Due to the richer language of higher-order arithmetic, the use of representations (aka &#x27;codes&#x27;) common in second-order arithmetic, is greatly reduced. 
For example, a continuous function on the Cantor space is just a function that maps binary sequences to binary sequences, and that also satisfies the usual &#x27;epsilon-delta&#x27;-definition of continuity.

Higher-order reverse mathematics includes higher-order versions of (second-order) comprehension schemes. Such a higher-order axiom states the existence of a functional that decides the truth or falsity of formulas of a given complexity. In this context, the complexity of formulas is also measured using the arithmetical hierarchy and analytical hierarchy. The higher-order counterparts of the major subsystems of second-order arithmetic generally prove the same second-order sentences (or a large subset) as the original second-order systems. For instance, the base theory of higher-order reverse mathematics, called , proves the same sentences as RCA0, up to language.

As noted in the previous paragraph, second-order comprehension axioms easily generalize to the higher-order framework. However, theorems expressing the &quot;compactness&quot; of basic spaces behave quite differently in second- and higher-order arithmetic: on one hand, when restricted to countable covers/the language of second-order arithmetic, the compactness of the unit interval is provable in WKL0 from the next section. On the other hand, given uncountable covers/the language of higher-order arithmetic, the compactness of the unit interval is only provable from (full) second-order arithmetic. Other covering lemmas (e.g. due to Lindelöf, Vitali, Besicovitch, etc.) exhibit the same behavior, and many basic properties of the gauge integral are equivalent to the compactness of the underlying space.

== The big five subsystems of second-order arithmetic ==

Second-order arithmetic is a formal theory of the natural numbers and sets of natural numbers. Many mathematical objects, such as countable rings, groups, and fields, as well as points in effective Polish spaces, can be represented as sets of natural numbers, and modulo this representation can be studied in second-order arithmetic.

Reverse mathematics makes use of several subsystems of second-order arithmetic. A typical reverse mathematics theorem shows that a particular mathematical theorem &quot;T&quot; is equivalent to a particular subsystem &quot;S&quot; of second-order arithmetic over a weaker subsystem &quot;B&quot;. This weaker system &quot;B&quot; is known as the base system for the result; in order for the reverse mathematics result to have
meaning, this system must not itself be able to prove the mathematical theorem &quot;T&quot;.

Steve Simpson describes five particular subsystems of second-order arithmetic, which he calls the Big Five, that occur frequently in reverse mathematics. In order of increasing strength, these systems are named by the initialisms RCA0, WKL0, ACA0, ATR0, and Π-CA0.

The following table summarizes the &quot;big five&quot; systems and lists the counterpart systems in higher-order arithmetic. 
The latter generally prove the same second-order sentences (or a large subset) as the original second-order systems.
The subscript 0 in these names means that the induction scheme has been restricted from the full second-order induction scheme. For example, ACA0 includes the induction axiom . This together with the full comprehension axiom of second-order arithmetic implies the full second-order induction scheme given by the universal closure of for any second-order formula &quot;φ&quot;. However ACA0 does not have the full comprehension axiom, and the subscript 0 is a reminder that it does not have the full second-order induction scheme either. This restriction is important: systems with restricted induction have significantly lower proof-theoretical ordinals than systems with the full second-order induction scheme.

=== The base system RCA0===
RCA0 is the fragment of second-order arithmetic whose axioms are the axioms of Robinson arithmetic, induction for Σ formulas, and comprehension for formulas.

The subsystem RCA0 is the one most commonly used as a base system for reverse mathematics. The initials &quot;RCA&quot; stand for &quot;recursive comprehension axiom&quot;, where &quot;recursive&quot; means &quot;computable&quot;, as in recursive function. This name is used because RCA0 corresponds informally to &quot;computable mathematics&quot;. In particular, any set of natural numbers that can be proven to exist in RCA0 is computable, and thus any theorem that implies that noncomputable sets exist is not provable in RCA0. To this extent, RCA0 is a constructive system, although it does not meet the requirements of the program of constructivism because it is a theory in classical logic including the law of excluded middle.

Despite its seeming weakness (of not proving any non-computable sets exist), RCA0 is sufficient to prove a number of classical theorems which, therefore, require only minimal logical strength. These theorems are, in a sense, below the reach of the reverse mathematics enterprise because they are already provable in the base system. The classical theorems provable in RCA0 include:
* Basic properties of the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers (for example, that the latter form an ordered field).
* Basic properties of the real numbers (the real numbers are an Archimedean ordered field; any nested sequence of closed intervals whose lengths tend to zero has a single point in its intersection; the real numbers are not countable).Section II.4
* The Baire category theorem for a complete separable metric space (the separability condition is necessary to even state the theorem in the language of second-order arithmetic).theorem II.5.8
* The intermediate value theorem on continuous real functions.theorem II.6.6
* The Banach–Steinhaus theorem for a sequence of continuous linear operators on separable Banach spaces.theorem II.10.8
* A weak version of Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem (for a set of sentences, in a countable language, that is already closed under consequence).
* The existence of an algebraic closure for a countable field (but not its uniqueness).II.9.4--II.9.8
* The existence and uniqueness of the real closure of a countable ordered field.II.9.5, II.9.7

The first-order part of RCA0 (the theorems of the system that do not involve any set variables) is the set of theorems of first-order Peano arithmetic with induction limited to Σ formulas. It is provably consistent, as is RCA0, in full first-order Peano arithmetic.

=== Weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma WKL0===

The subsystem WKL0 consists of RCA0 plus a weak form of Kőnig&#x27;s lemma, namely the statement that every infinite subtree of the full binary tree (the tree of all finite sequences of 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s) has an infinite path. This proposition, which is known as &quot;weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma&quot;, is easy to state in the language of second-order arithmetic. WKL0 can also be defined as the principle of Σ separation (given two Σ formulas of a free variable &quot;n&quot; that are exclusive, there is a set containing all &quot;n&quot; satisfying the one and no &quot;n&quot; satisfying the other). When this axiom is added to RCA0, the resulting subsystem is called WKL0. A similar distinction between particular axioms on the one hand, and subsystems including the basic axioms and induction on the other hand, is made for the stronger subsystems described below.

In a sense, weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma is a form of the axiom of choice (although, as stated, it can be proven in classical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice). It is not constructively valid in some senses of the word &quot;constructive&quot;.

To show that WKL0 is actually stronger than (not provable in) RCA0, it is sufficient to exhibit a theorem of WKL0 that implies that noncomputable sets exist. This is not difficult; WKL0 implies the existence of separating sets for effectively inseparable recursively enumerable sets.

It turns out that RCA0 and WKL0 have the same first-order part, meaning that they prove the same first-order sentences. WKL0 can prove a good number of classical mathematical results that do not follow from RCA0, however. These results are not expressible as first-order statements but can be expressed as second-order statements.

The following results are equivalent to weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma and thus to WKL0 over RCA0:

* The Heine–Borel theorem for the closed unit real interval, in the following sense: every covering by a sequence of open intervals has a finite subcovering.
* The Heine–Borel theorem for complete totally bounded separable metric spaces (where covering is by a sequence of open balls).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval (or on any compact separable metric space, as above) is bounded (or: bounded and reaches its bounds).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval can be uniformly approximated by polynomials (with rational coefficients).
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval is uniformly continuous.
* A continuous real function on the closed unit interval is Riemann integrable.
* The Brouwer fixed point theorem (for continuous functions on an formula_1-simplex).Theorem IV.7.7
* The separable Hahn–Banach theorem in the form: a bounded linear form on a subspace of a separable Banach space extends to a bounded linear form on the whole space.
* The Jordan curve theorem
* Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem (for a countable language).
* Determinacy for open (or even clopen) games on {0,1} of length ω.
* Every countable commutative ring has a prime ideal.
* Every countable formally real field is orderable.
* Uniqueness of algebraic closure (for a countable field).

=== Arithmetical comprehension ACA0===

ACA0 is RCA0 plus the comprehension scheme for arithmetical formulas (which is sometimes called the &quot;arithmetical comprehension axiom&quot;). That is, ACA0 allows us to form the set of natural numbers satisfying an arbitrary arithmetical formula (one with no bound set variables, although possibly containing set parameters).pp. 6--7 Actually, it suffices to add to RCA0 the comprehension scheme for Σ1 formulas (also including second-order free variables) in order to obtain full arithmetical comprehension.Lemma III.1.3

The first-order part of ACA0 is exactly first-order Peano arithmetic; ACA0 is a &quot;conservative&quot; extension of first-order Peano arithmetic.Corollary IX.1.6 The two systems are provably (in a weak system) equiconsistent. ACA0 can be thought of as a framework of predicative mathematics, although there are predicatively provable theorems that are not provable in ACA0. Most of the fundamental results about the natural numbers, and many other mathematical theorems, can be proven in this system.

One way of seeing that ACA0 is stronger than WKL0 is to exhibit a model of WKL0 that doesn&#x27;t contain all arithmetical sets. In fact, it is possible to build a model of WKL0 consisting entirely of low sets using the low basis theorem, since low sets relative to low sets are low.

The following assertions are equivalent to ACA0
over RCA0:
* The sequential completeness of the real numbers (every bounded increasing sequence of real numbers has a limit).theorem III.2.2
* The Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem.theorem III.2.2
* Ascoli&#x27;s theorem: every bounded equicontinuous sequence of real functions on the unit interval has a uniformly convergent subsequence.
* Every countable field embeds isomorphically into its algebraic closure.theorem III.3.2
* Every countable commutative ring has a maximal ideal.theorem III.5.5
* Every countable vector space over the rationals (or over any countable field) has a basis.theorem III.4.3
* For any countable fields formula_2, there is a transcendence basis for formula_3 over formula_4.theorem III.4.6
* Kőnig&#x27;s lemma (for arbitrary finitely branching trees, as opposed to the weak version described above).theorem III.7.2
* For any countable group formula_5 and any subgroups formula_6 of formula_5, the subgroup generated by formula_8 exists.p.40
* Any partial function can be extended to a total function.
* Various theorems in combinatorics, such as certain forms of Ramsey&#x27;s theorem.Theorem III.7.2

=== Arithmetical transfinite recursion ATR0===

The system ATR0 adds to ACA0 an axiom that states, informally, that any arithmetical functional (meaning any arithmetical formula with a free number variable &quot;n&quot; and a free set variable &quot;X&quot;, seen as the operator taking &quot;X&quot; to the set of &quot;n&quot; satisfying the formula) can be iterated transfinitely along any countable well ordering starting with any set. ATR0 is equivalent over ACA0 to the principle of Σ separation. ATR0 is impredicative, and has the proof-theoretic ordinal formula_9, the supremum of that of predicative systems.

ATR0 proves the consistency of ACA0, and thus by Gödel&#x27;s theorem it is strictly stronger.

The following assertions are equivalent to
ATR0 over RCA0:
* Any two countable well orderings are comparable. That is, they are isomorphic or one is isomorphic to a proper initial segment of the other.theorem V.6.8
* Ulm&#x27;s theorem for countable reduced Abelian groups.
* The perfect set theorem, which states that every uncountable closed subset of a complete separable metric space contains a perfect closed set.
* Lusin&#x27;s separation theorem (essentially Σ separation).Theorem V.5.1
* Determinacy for open sets in the Baire space.

=== Π comprehension Π-CA0===

Π-CA0 is stronger than arithmetical transfinite recursion and is fully impredicative. It consists of RCA0 plus the comprehension scheme for Π formulas.

In a sense, Π-CA0 comprehension is to arithmetical transfinite recursion (Σ separation) as ACA0 is to weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma (Σ separation). It is equivalent to several statements of descriptive set theory whose proofs make use of strongly impredicative arguments; this equivalence shows that these impredicative arguments cannot be removed.

The following theorems are equivalent to Π-CA0 over RCA0:
* The Cantor–Bendixson theorem (every closed set of reals is the union of a perfect set and a countable set).Exercise VI.1.7
* Silver&#x27;s dichotomy (every coanalytic equivalence relation has either countably many equivalence classes or a perfect set of incomparables)Theorem VI.3.6
* Every countable abelian group is the direct sum of a divisible group and a reduced group.Theorem VI.4.1
* Determinacy for formula_10 games.Theorem VI.5.4

== Additional systems ==

* Weaker systems than recursive comprehension can be defined. The weak system RCA consists of elementary function arithmetic EFA (the basic axioms plus Δ induction in the enriched language with an exponential operation) plus Δ comprehension. Over RCA, recursive comprehension as defined earlier (that is, with Σ induction) is equivalent to the statement that a polynomial (over a countable field) has only finitely many roots and to the classification theorem for finitely generated Abelian groups. The system RCA has the same proof theoretic ordinal ω3 as EFA and is conservative over EFA for Π sentences.
* Weak Weak Kőnig&#x27;s Lemma is the statement that a subtree of the infinite binary tree having no infinite paths has an asymptotically vanishing proportion of the leaves at length &quot;n&quot; (with a uniform estimate as to how many leaves of length &quot;n&quot; exist). An equivalent formulation is that any subset of Cantor space that has positive measure is nonempty (this is not provable in RCA0). WWKL0 is obtained by adjoining this axiom to RCA0. It is equivalent to the statement that if the unit real interval is covered by a sequence of intervals then the sum of their lengths is at least one. The model theory of WWKL0 is closely connected to the theory of algorithmically random sequences. In particular, an ω-model of RCA0 satisfies weak weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma if and only if for every set &quot;X&quot; there is a set &quot;Y&quot; that is 1-random relative to &quot;X&quot;.
* DNR (short for &quot;diagonally non-recursive&quot;) adds to RCA0 an axiom asserting the existence of a diagonally non-recursive function relative to every set. That is, DNR states that, for any set &quot;A&quot;, there exists a total function &quot;f&quot; such that for all &quot;e&quot; the &quot;e&quot;th partial recursive function with oracle &quot;A&quot; is not equal to &quot;f&quot;. DNR is strictly weaker than WWKL (Lempp &quot;et al.&quot;, 2004).
* Δ-comprehension is in certain ways analogous to arithmetical transfinite recursion as recursive comprehension is to weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma. It has the hyperarithmetical sets as minimal ω-model. Arithmetical transfinite recursion proves Δ-comprehension but not the other way around.
* Σ-choice is the statement that if &quot;η&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;X&quot;) is a Σ formula such that for each &quot;n&quot; there exists an &quot;X&quot; satisfying η then there is a sequence of sets &quot;Xn&quot; such that &quot;η&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;Xn&quot;) holds for each &quot;n&quot;. Σ-choice also has the hyperarithmetical sets as minimal ω-model. Arithmetical transfinite recursion proves Σ-choice but not the other way around.
* HBU (short for &quot;uncountable Heine-Borel&quot;) expresses the (open-cover) compactness of the unit interval, involving &quot;uncountable covers&quot;. The latter aspect of HBU makes it only expressible in the language of &quot;third-order&quot; arithmetic. Cousin&#x27;s theorem (1895) implies HBU, and these theorems use the same notion of cover due to Cousin and Lindelöf. HBU is &quot;hard&quot; to prove: in terms of the usual hierarchy of comprehension axioms, a proof of HBU requires full second-order arithmetic.
* Ramsey&#x27;s theorem for infinite graphs does not fall into one of the big five subsystems, and there are many other weaker variants with varying proof strengths.

===Stronger systems===
Over RCA0, Π transfinite recursion, ∆ determinacy, and the ∆ Ramsey theorem are all equivalent to each other.

Over RCA0, Σ monotonic induction, Σ determinacy, and the Σ Ramsey theorem are all equivalent to each other.

The following are equivalent:
* (schema) Π consequences of Π-CA0
* RCA0 + (schema over finite &quot;n&quot;) determinacy in the &quot;n&quot;th level of the difference hierarchy of Σ sets
* RCA0 + {τ: τ is a true S2S sentence}

The set of Π consequences of second-order arithmetic Z2 has the same theory as RCA0 + (schema over finite &quot;n&quot;) determinacy in the &quot;n&quot;th level of the difference hierarchy of Σ sets.

For a poset formula_11, let formula_12 denote the topological space consisting of the filters on formula_11 whose open sets are the sets of the form formula_14 for some formula_15. The following statement is equivalent to formula_16 over formula_17: for any countable poset formula_11, the topological space formula_12 is completely metrizable iff it is regular.

==ω-models and β-models==
The ω in ω-model stands for the set of non-negative integers (or finite ordinals). An ω-model is a model for a fragment of second-order arithmetic whose first-order part is the standard model of Peano arithmetic, but whose second-order part may be non-standard. More precisely, an ω-model is given by a choice formula_20 of subsets of formula_21. The first-order variables are interpreted in the usual way as elements of formula_21, and formula_23, formula_24 have their usual meanings, while second-order variables are interpreted as elements of formula_25. There is a standard ω-model where one just takes formula_25 to consist of all subsets of the integers. However, there are also other ω-models; for example, RCA0 has a minimal ω-model where formula_25 consists of the recursive subsets of formula_21.

A β-model is an ω model that agrees with the standard ω-model on truth of formula_29 and formula_30 sentences (with parameters).

Non-ω models are also useful, especially in the proofs of conservation theorems.

<doc id="326374" wikidata="Q336027" url="?curid=326374" title="Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard">
<text>Frederick John Dealtry Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard (22 January 1858 – 11 April 1945), known as Sir Frederick Lugard between 1901 and 1928, was a British soldier, explorer of Africa and a colonial administrator. He was Governor of Hong Kong (1907–1912), the last Governor of Southern Nigeria Protectorate (1912–1914), the first High Commissioner (1900–1906) and last Governor (1912–1914) of Northern Nigeria Protectorate and the first Governor-General of Nigeria (1914–1919).

==Early life and education==
Lugard was born in Madras (now Chennai) in India, but was brought up in Worcester, England. He was the son of the Reverend Frederick Grueber Lugard, a British Army chaplain at Madras, and his third wife Mary Howard (1819–1865), the youngest daughter of Reverend John Garton Howard (1786–1862), a younger son of landed gentry from Thorne and Melbourne near York. His paternal uncle was Sir Edward Lugard, Adjutant-General in India from 1857 to 1858 and Permanent Under-Secretary of State for War at the War Office from 1861 to 1871. Lugard was educated at Rossall School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. The name &quot;Dealtry&quot; was in honour of Thomas Dealtry, a friend of his father.

==Military career==

Lugard was commissioned into the 9th Foot (East Norfolk Regiment) in 1878 and joined the second battalion in India; he served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–1880), the Sudan campaign (1884–1885) and the Third Anglo-Burmese War (November 1885) and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1887. After this promising start, his career was derailed when he fell in love with a twice married British divorcee he met in India; learning she had been injured in an accident, he abandoned his post in Burma to join her in Lucknow, then followed her to England. When she rejected him, Lugard decided to make a fresh start in Africa.

===Karonga War===
Around 1880, a group of Swahili traders under Mlozi bin Kazbadema established trading bases in the north-west sector of Lake Malawi, including a stockade at Chilumba on the lake from where ivory and slaves could be shipped across the lake. In 1883 the African Lakes Company set up a base in Karonga to exchange ivory for trade goods from these Swahili merchants.

Relations between the two groups deteriorated, partly because of the company&#x27;s delays or unwillingness to provide guns, ammunition and other trade goods, and also because the Swahili traders turned more to slaving, attacking communities that the company had promised to protect, and hostilities broke out in mid-1887. The series of intermittent armed clashes that took place up to mid-1889 is known as the Karonga War, or sometimes the Arab War.

The African Lakes Company depot at Karonga was evacuated at the end of the year but in May 1888, Captain Lugard, persuaded by the British Consul at Mozambique, arrived to lead an expedition against Mlozi, sponsored by the African Lakes Company but without official support from the British government.

Lugard&#x27;s first expedition of May to June 1888 attacked the Swahili stockades with limited success and, in the course of one attack, Lugard was wounded and withdrew south. Lugard&#x27;s second expedition in December 1888 to March 1889 was larger and included a 7-pounder gun, which, however, failed to breach the stockade walls. Following this second failure, Lugard left the Lake Malawi region for Britain in April 1889.

==Exploration of East Africa==
After leaving Nyasaland in April 1889, Lugard accepted a position with the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) and arrived in Mombasa on the coast of east Africa that December. A year earlier in 1888, the IBEAC had been granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria to colonise the &#x27;British sphere of influence&#x27; between Zanzibar and Uganda and were keen to open a trading route between Lake Victoria in Uganda and the coastal port of Mombasa. Their first interior trading post was established at Machakos 240 miles in from the coast. But the established traditional route to Machakos was a treacherous journey through the large Taru Desert —93 miles of scorching dust bowl.

Lugard&#x27;s first mission was to determine the feasibility of a route from Mombasa to Machakos that would bypass the Taru Desert. He explored the Sabaki River and the neighbouring region, in addition to elaborating a scheme for the emancipation of the slaves held by Arabs in the Zanzibar mainland.

On 6 August 1890, Lugard began his caravan expedition to Uganda, accompanied by five other Europeans - George Wilson, Fenwick De Winton (son of Francis de Winton - Lugard&#x27;s other chief), William Grant and Archibald Brown.

Departing from Mombasa towards Uganda to secure British predominance over German influence in the area and put an end to the civil disturbances between factions in the kingdom of Buganda.

En route, Lugard was instructed to enter into treaties with local tribes and build forts in order to secure safe passage for future IBEAC expeditions. The IBEAC employed official treaty documents that were signed by their administrator and the local leaders but Lugard preferred the more equitable blood brotherhood ceremony and entered into several brotherhood partnerships with leaders who inhabited the areas between Mombasa and Uganda. One of his famed blood partnerships was sealed in October 1890 during his journey to Uganda when he stopped at Dagoretti in Kikuyu territory and entered into an alliance with Waiyaki Wa Hinga.

Lugard was Military Administrator of Uganda from 26 December 1890 to May 1892. While administering Uganda, he journeyed round the Rwenzori Mountains to Lake Edward, mapping a large area of the country. He also visited Lake Albert and brought away some thousands of Sudanese who had been left there by Emin Pasha and H. M. Stanley during the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition.

When Lugard returned to England in 1892, he successfully dissuaded Prime Minister William Gladstone from allowing the IBEAC to abandon Uganda.

==Early colonial service==

In 1894, Lugard was dispatched by the Royal Niger Company to Borgu, where he secured treaties with the kings and chiefs who acknowledged the sovereignty of the British company, while reducing the influence of other colonial powers. From 1896 to 1897, Lugard took charge of an expedition to Lake Ngami, in modern-day Botswana, on behalf of the British West Charterland Company. He was recalled from Ngami by the British government and sent to West Africa, where he was commissioned to raise a native force to protect British interests in the hinterland of the Lagos Colony and Nigeria against French aggression. In August 1897, Lugard organised the West African Frontier Force and commanded it until the end of December 1899, when the disputes with France were settled.

After relinquishing command of the West African Frontier Force, Lugard was appointed High Commissioner of the newly created Protectorate of Northern Nigeria. He was present at Mount Patti, Lokoja and read the proclamation that established the protectorate on 1 January 1900. At that time, the portion of Northern Nigeria under effective control was small, and Lugard&#x27;s task in organising this vast territory was made more difficult by the refusal of the sultan of Sokoto and many other Fula princes to fulfill their treaty obligations.

In 1903, British control over the whole protectorate was made possible by a successful campaign against the emir of Kano and the sultan of Sokoto. By the time Lugard resigned as commissioner in 1906, the entire region of what would eventually be transformed into modern-day Nigeria was being peacefully administered under the supervision of British residents.

Lugard was knighted in the 1901 New Year Honours for his service in Nigeria.

Lugard restored peace and order, and suppressed Fulani despotism. He also stopped slave raiding and abolished slavery and the slave trade. He began developing the country by getting it surveyed, mapped, and improved transport and communications. He also re-organised the taxation system. Lugard is most importantly remembered for his political system of rule which was practised in Nigeria, called indirect rule, particularly in Igboland.

==Governor of Hong Kong==

About a year after he resigned as High Commissioner of the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, Lugard was appointed Governor of Hong Kong, a position he held until March 1912. During his tenure, Lugard proposed to return Weihaiwei to the Chinese government, in return for the ceding of the rented New Territories in perpetuity. However, the proposal was neither well received nor acted upon. Some believed that if the proposal were carried through, Hong Kong might forever have remained in British hands.

Lugard&#x27;s chief interest was education and he was largely remembered for his efforts to the founding of the University of Hong Kong in 1911. He became the first chancellor, despite a cold reception from the Colonial Office and local British companies, such as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The Colonial Office called the idea of a university &quot;Sir Frederick&#x27;s pet lamb&quot;. Lugard&#x27;s chief impetus from founding the university was to have it serve as a bearer of Western culture in East Asia. He expected the university, however, to adopt a politically conservative framework supportive of the colonial authorities and refrain from teaching ideas such as democracy or equality. He was financially backed by his personal friend Sir Horsusjee Naorojee Mody who shared the same vision for the establishment of a university in Hong Kong.

==Governor of Nigeria==

In 1912, Lugard returned to Nigeria as Governor of the two protectorates. His mission was to combine the two colonies into one. Although controversial in Lagos, where it was opposed by a large section of the political class and the media, the amalgamation did not arouse passion in the rest of the country because the people were unaware of the implications. Lugard took scant notice of public opinion, neither did he feel there was need for consensus among the locals on such a serious political subject which had such key implications for the two colonies. From 1914 to 1919, Lugard served as Governor General of the now combined colony of Nigeria. Throughout his tenure, he sought strenuously to secure the amelioration of the condition of the native people, among other means by the exclusion, wherever possible, of alcoholic liquors, and by the suppression of slave raiding and slavery.

Lugard, assisted by his indefatigable wife, Flora Shaw, concocted a legend which warped understanding of him, Nigeria and colonial rule for decades. He believed that &quot;the typical African ... is a happy, thriftless, excitable person, lacking in self control, discipline and foresight, naturally courageous, courteous and polite, full of personal vanity, with little of veracity; in brief, the virtues and defects of this race-type are those of attractive children.&quot;

Funding of the colony of Nigeria in the development of state&#x27;s infrastructure such as harbours, railways and hospitals in Southern Nigeria came from revenue generated by taxes on imported alcohol. In Northern Nigeria, the revenue that allowed state development projects was less because the taxes was absent and thus funding of projects was covered from revenue generated in the south.

The Adubi War occurred during his governorship. In Northern Nigeria, Lugard permitted slavery within traditional native elite families. He loathed the educated and sophisticated Africans living in the coastal regions. Lugard ran the country whilst spending half each year in England, where he could promote himself and was distant from realities in Africa, where subordinates had to delay decisions on many matters until he returned. He based his rule on a military system—unlike William MacGregor, a doctor turned governor, who mixed with all ranks of people and listened to what was wanted. The Lugard who opposed &quot;native education&quot; later became involved in Hong Kong University, and the man who disliked traders and businessmen became a director of a Nigerian bank.

When the British Government decided to raise a local militia to protect the western frontier of the Royal Niger Company&#x27;s territory against French advance from Dahomey, Lugard was sent and he successfully organised the West African Frontier Force, which he used successfully to defend not only the western but the northern frontiers of Nigeria from French encroachment. This saved Nigeria from the assimilation issues of the French.

Lugard&#x27;s greatest contribution to the making of modern Nigeria was the successful amalgamation of the North and South in 1914. Even after the amalgamation, the two parts remained as two separate countries with separate administrations. &quot;Though in doing this, he aimed primarily at making the wealth and seaport facilities of the South available to the North, he had in fact fashioned the political unity of the Giant of Africa.&quot; As noted earlier, amalgamation of Nigeria helped in making Nigeria to have common telegraphs, railways, customs and excise, a Supreme Court, a standard time, a common currency, and a common civil service; he introduced all the necessities needed for infrastructure in a modern state.

More importantly, he laid the foundations of continuous legislative assemblies in Nigeria by establishing the Nigerian council in 1914. It consisted of the Governor, Chief Secretary and a few nominated members who met to listen to government policies and give their advice. Unfortunately, it legislated only for the South. It could be referred to as a mock parliament because it set pace for the Legislative Council of later years.

In spite of his contributions, Lugard&#x27;s work was not without faults. &quot;He aimed at creating in Nigeria one administrative unit but he did not intend to create a Nigerian nation&quot;. Instead, his policy of isolating the North from the South, a policy which his successors maintained had a hand in the present disunity of Nigeria till today. An example is the exclusion of the North from the Legislative Council until 1947. &quot;Thus, it can be said that Lugard sowed the seeds of separatist tendency which has still plagued Nigerian unity&quot;.
Lugard was also partly responsible for the backwardness in the education and other social services of the Northerners And this is the reason for the South&#x27;s advance in education over the North.
To sum it up, Lugard&#x27;s attitude to Nigeria implied that he did not envisage self-government for Nigeria. He planned for perpetual British colonialism. &quot;His system of Indirect Rule, his hostility towards educated Nigerians in the South, and his system of education for the North which aimed at training only the sons of the chiefs and emirs as clerks and interpreters show him as one of Britain&#x27;s arch-imperialists&quot;, says K. B. C. Onwubiko.

Regarding the future of British colonialism in Africa, he stated, &quot;For two or three generations we can show the negro what we are, then we shall be asked to go away. Then we shall leave the land to those it belongs to with a feeling that they have better business friends in us than in other white men.&quot;

==&quot;The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa&quot;==
Lugard&#x27;s &quot;The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa&quot; was published in 1922 and discussed indirect rule in colonial Africa. He argued that administration of Africa could simultaneously promote the well-being of the inhabitants and develop the resources of the continent for the benefit of mankind. According to Lugard, there were three principles of colonial administration: decentralization (granting power to local district officers in colonies), continuity (extensive record-keeping so that successors would build upon the policies of predecessors), and cooperation (building local support for the colonial government). He defended British colonial practices, in particular the system of indirect rule that he introduced in Nigeria. The task of the British, he wrote, was ‘to promote the commercial and industrial progress of Africa without too careful a scrutiny of the material gains to ourselves’.

In this work, Lugard outlined the reasons and methods that he recommended for the colonisation of Africa. Some of his justifications for establishing colonial rule included spreading Christianity and ending barbaric practices by Africans such as human sacrifice. He also saw state-sponsored colonisation as a way to protect missionaries, local chiefs and local people from each other, as well as from foreign powers. For Lugard, it was also vital that Britain gain control of unclaimed areas before Germany, Portugal or France claimed the land and its resources for themselves. He realised that there were vast profits to be made through the export of resources such as rubber, and through taxation of native populations as well as importers and exporters (the British taxpayer continually made a loss from the colonies in this period). In addition, these resources and inexpensive native labour (slavery having been abolished by Britain in 1833) would provide vital fuel for the industrial revolution in resource-depleted Britain, as well as monies for public works projects. Finally, Lugard reasoned that colonisation had become a fad and that, in order to remain a global power, Britain would need to hold colonies to avoid appearing weak.

William Rappard was influenced by Lugard&#x27;s book. He sought to get Lugard appointed to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations.

==League of Nations and Abolitionist activism==

Between 1922 and 1936, Lugard was the British representative on the League of Nations&#x27; Permanent Mandates Commission. Lugard saw imperial administration in moral terms and advocated for humane principles of colonial rule. He saw the role of the Permanent Mandates Commission as involving standard-setting and oversight, whereas actual administration should be left to national powers.

Lugard supported General George Spafford Richardson&#x27;s repressive rule of Western Samoa. Lugard criticized European settlers and Samoans who engaged in &quot;interracial mobilization.&quot; Lugard played a key role in drafting a Commission report that exonerated Richardson&#x27;s governance of Western Samoa and placed the blame of the Western Samoa unrest on the anti-colonial activist Olaf Frederick Nelson.

During this period he served first on the Temporary Slavery Commission and was involved in organising the 1926 Slavery Convention. He had submitted a proposal for the convention to the British government. Although they were initially alarmed by it, the British government backed the proposal (after subjecting it to considerable redrafting) and it was eventually enacted. 
He served as one of the seven members of the Committee of Experts on Slavery (CES) of the League of Nations in 1932-1933. 

Lugard served on the International Labour Organization&#x27;s Committee of Experts on Native Labour from 1925 to 1941.

== Lugard&#x27;s beliefs ==

Lugard pushed for native rule in the British colonies of Africa. He reasoned that black Africans were very different from the Europeans, although he did speculate on the admixture of Aryan or Hamitic blood arising from the advent of Islam among the Hausa and Fulani. He considered that natives should act as a sort of middle manager in colonial governance. This would avoid revolt because, he believed, the native people of Africa would be more likely to follow someone who looked like them, spoke their languages and shared their customs.

Olúfẹmi Táíwò argued that Lugard blocked Black Africans who had been educated in Europe from playing an active role in the development of Colonial Nigeria; he distrusted white &quot;intellectuals&quot; as much as black ones, believing that the principles they were taught in the universities were often wrong. Lugard preferred to advance prominent Hausa and Fulani leaders from traditional structures.

Lugard was an advocate for European paternalist governance over black Africans. He described them as holding &quot;the position of a late-born child in the family of nations, and must as yet be schooled in the discipline of the nursery.&quot;

==Honours==

Lugard was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1895. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1901 New Year Honours and raised to a Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in 1911. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1920 New Year Honours. In 1928 he was further honoured when he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Lugard, of Abinger in the County of Surrey.

The Royal Geographical Society awarded him the Founder&#x27;s Medal in 1902 for persistent attention to African geography.

A bronze bust of Lugard, created by Pilkington Jackson in 1960, is held in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Lugard Road on Victoria Peak in Hong Kong, China is named after him.

==Personal life==
Lugard married, on 10 June 1902, Flora Shaw, daughter of Major-General George Shaw, and granddaughter of Sir Frederick Shaw, 3rd Baronet. She was a foreign correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; and coined the place name &quot;Nigeria&quot;. There were no children from the marriage. She died in January 1929; Lugard survived her by sixteen years and died on 11 April 1945, aged 87. Since he was childless, the barony became extinct. He was cremated at Woking Crematorium.

==Published works==

*In 1893, Lugard published &quot;The Rise of our East African Empire&quot;, which was partially an autobiography. He was also the author of various valuable reports on Northern Nigeria issued by the Colonial Office.

<text> (, &quot;Duty&quot;) is a French-language newspaper published in Montreal and distributed in Quebec and throughout Canada. It was founded by journalist and politician Henri Bourassa in 1910.

 is one of few independent large-circulation newspapers in Quebec (and one of the few in Canada) in a market dominated by the media conglomerate Quebecor (including ).

Historically was considered Canada&#x27;s francophone newspaper of record, although by the end of the 20th century, that title was mostly used for its competitor .

== History ==
Henri Bourassa, a young Liberal Party MP from Montreal, rose to national prominence in 1899 when he resigned his seat in Parliament in protest at the Liberal government&#x27;s decision to send troops to support the British in the South African War of 1899–1902. Bourassa was opposed to all Canadian participation in British wars and would go on to become a key figure in fighting for an independent Canadian foreign policy. He is considered both a forebear of French-Canadian nationalists as well as a Canadian nationalist more generally. He was also an early promoter of the bi-cultural Anglo-French concept of Canada, and an impassioned advocate for the political and cultural equality of all French Canadians within Confederation, wherever they may reside.

In 1910, he founded as an outlet for his anti-imperialist Ligue nationaliste and to fight for the rights of French Canadians within Confederation. In its first edition, published January 10, 1910, Bourassa explained the name (&quot;the duty&quot; in English) and the mandate of the newspaper as &quot;To ensure the triumph of ideas over appetites, of the public good over partisan interests, there is but one means: awake in the people, and above all in the ruling classes, a sense of public duty in all its forms: religious duty, national duty, civic duty.&quot;

Bourassa was both publisher and editor-in-chief of the newspaper until August 3, 1932, when he was replaced by Georges Pelletier. After the death of Pelletier in early 1947, the role of editor-in-chief would pass to Gérard Filion, former editor of &quot;La Terre de chez nous&quot;, under whose editorship the paper would publish highly controversial critiques of Maurice Duplessis&#x27;s government in Quebec by journalists and figures such as André Laurendeau. Claude Ryan, a federalist, took the helm in 1964, followed by Jean-Louis Roy in 1980, then Benoit Lauzière in 1986. In 1990, the paper appointed its first woman editor-in-chief when Lise Bissonnette succeeded Lauzière, and firmly establishing the paper&#x27;s sovereignist orientation following the federalist years of Ryan and his successors. She would continue on in her post until 1998, with the current editor-in-chief, Bernard Descôteaux, taking over the following year.

While the paper has in recent times become associated with the Quebec nationalist movement, Bourassa himself was in fact opposed to the notion of a separate Francophone state, believing instead in an Anglo-French conception of Canada in which French-speaking Canadians would see their culture recognized as equal and protected and encouraged from coast to coast. Instances of this view can be found in both his campaign for Franco-Ontarian rights as well as his ardent opposition to controversial priest and historian Lionel Groulx in the 1920s following Groulx&#x27;s musing on the possibility and desirability of a separate Quebec state. That said, the history of &quot;Le Devoir&quot; would become characterized by varying phases (as well as shades) of French-Canadian and later Québécois nationalism, opening its pages in the troubled 1930s to Groulx and his followers, yet seeing a federalist at its helm in 1964 in the form of Claude Ryan, who in 1978 would go on to become leader of the federalist Quebec Liberal Party.

Ideologically, &quot;Le Devoir&quot; has been a chief voice against military intervention and in favour of pacifism and social democracy, opposing conscription in World War II (see Conscription Crisis of 1944) and endorsing, under federalist Ryan&#x27;s tenure, the election of René Lévesque&#x27;s Parti Québécois in the 1976 election, despite its platform centred on Québécois nationalism. Once considered a reformist paper, it has recently been associated less with ideas that challenge the status quo of Quebec&#x27;s economic, political and cultural issues.

== Business ==
&quot;Le Devoir&quot; began as several other businesses besides the newspaper. These ventures included a general printer and publishing house, a bookstore, and a travel agency. Trips were initially organized to coincide with Catholic congresses around the world, as well as for &quot;pilgrimages&quot;, allowing Quebecois to visit the French diaspora across North America. Such trips included Acadia (1924, 1927), Ontario (1925), and Louisiana (1931). The purpose of the travel venture was, said Napoleon Lafortune, to &quot;extend the &#x27;work&#x27; of the newspaper to defend the French language and the Catholic faith, but by other means.&quot; The unusual service officially lasted from 1924 to 1947, though it effectively ended at the start of World War II when international civilian travel became very difficult.

&quot;Le Devoir&quot; has a relatively low circulation of about 34,000 on weekdays and 58,000 on Saturdays. Its financial situation has often been precarious. For example, in 2002 it had revenues of $14,376,530, with a meager profit of $13,524, while the previous year it had incurred a small loss.

== Other information ==
The newspaper&#x27;s original slogan was &quot;Fais ce que dois&quot; (Do what [you] must). &quot;Le Devoir&quot; means &quot;the duty&quot; in French. Its current slogan is &quot;Libre de penser&quot; (Free to think).

In 1993, following a redesign by Lucie Lacava, a Montreal-based design consultant, the Society for News Design awarded &quot;Le Devoir&quot; Best of Show award for &quot;Overall Design Excellence&quot; and in 1994 the same group awarded it its Gold award in the Feature Design category.

In September 2011, the National Film Board of Canada and &quot;Le Devoir&quot; announced that they will be jointly hosting three interactive essays on their websites, ONF.ca and ledevoir.com.

&quot;Le Devoir&quot; headquarters have been located in Montreal at 71A rue Saint-Jacques from 1910 to 1914; at 443 rue Saint-Vincent in Old Montreal from 1914 to 1924; at 430 rue Notre-Dame East from 1924 to 1972; at 211 rue du Saint-Sacrement from 1972 to 1992, at 2050 rue de Bleury from 1992 to 2016; before moving to 1265 rue Berri on December 11, 2016.

<text>Lela Alene Brooks (February 7, 1908 – September 11, 1990) was a Canadian speed skater and multiple world-record holder. She specialized in short track skating.

==Biography==
Born in Toronto, Brooks was the first female member of the Old Orchard Skating Club and entered her first race at age 12. Her father, a dental technician, and her mother both skated and encouraged their kids toward the sport. She had two siblings, one of which was an older brother who also went on to become a Canadian skating champion. She began setting Ontario and Canadian records in 1923 at the age of 15. By the end of 1925, when she was 17, Brooks had broken six world records. She would ultimately set 17 world records and win 65 championships over her skating career, all done within North America.

At the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, she participated in three demonstration events, all with competitors from Canada and the United States. She made it to the finals in all three events, but placed no higher than fourth. Her time in the 1500 m heats, 2:54.0, was more than 15 seconds under the official world record, but the time was not recognised since the race was skated under the North American mass start rules.

In 1933, Brooks was listed among her country&#x27;s elite athletes as one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Big Trains&quot; by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. Later that year, her divorce from her first husband, Arthur Potter, was widely publicized. Despite all of her achievements, Brooks remained an amateur athlete throughout her career and did not employ a formal coach. She did receive some limited sponsorship, however, as CCM provided her with $10 per week and two pairs of skates each season. She was also sponsored in her early years by millionaire ice hockey team owner Teddy Oke.

She qualified for the 1936 Winter Olympics, the first time women&#x27;s speed skating competed officially, but chose to retire. Later that year, she married druggist Russ Campbell and moved to Owen Sound, Ontario, where he opened a pharmacy. They had four children together, including at least one daughter, Dorothy Jane Campbell (1947–1978). Campbell passed away in 1967 after 31 years of marriage. Brooks died in Owen Sound at age 82 and, though she had married a third husband, Cliff Bleich, in 1972, she was buried in Owen Sound&#x27;s Greenwood Cemetery with her second husband, Russ.

In 1972, Brooks was inducted into both the Speed Skating Canada Hall of Fame and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>An ion source is a device that creates atomic and molecular ions. Ion sources are used to form ions for mass spectrometers, optical emission spectrometers, particle accelerators, ion implanters and ion engines.

==Electron ionization==
Electron ionization is widely used in mass spectrometry, particularly for organic molecules. The gas phase reaction producing electron ionization is

:&lt;chem&gt;M{} + e^- -&gt; M^{+\bullet}{} + 2e^- &lt;/chem&gt;

where M is the atom or molecule being ionized, &lt;chem&gt;e^-&lt;/chem&gt; is the electron, and &lt;chem&gt;M^{+\bullet}&lt;/chem&gt; is the resulting ion.

The electrons may be created by an arc discharge between a cathode and an anode.

An electron beam ion source (EBIS) is used in atomic physics to produce highly charged ions by bombarding atoms with a powerful electron beam. Its principle of operation is shared by the electron beam ion trap.

===Electron capture ionization===
Electron capture ionization (ECI) is the ionization of a gas phase atom or molecule by attachment of an electron to create an ion of the form A−•. The reaction is

:&lt;chem&gt;A + e^- -&gt;[M] A^-&lt;/chem&gt;

where the M over the arrow denotes that to conserve energy and momentum a third body is required (the molecularity of the reaction is three).

Electron capture can be used in conjunction with chemical ionization.

An electron capture detector is used in some gas chromatography systems.

==Chemical ionization==

Chemical ionization (CI) is a lower energy process than electron ionization because it involves ion/molecule reactions rather than electron removal. The lower energy yields less fragmentation, and usually a simpler spectrum. A typical CI spectrum has an easily identifiable molecular ion.

In a CI experiment, ions are produced through the collision of the analyte with ions of a reagent gas in the ion source. Some common reagent gases include: methane, ammonia, and isobutane. Inside the ion source, the reagent gas is present in large excess compared to the analyte. Electrons entering the source will preferentially ionize the reagent gas. The resultant collisions with other reagent gas molecules will create an ionization plasma. Positive and negative ions of the analyte are formed by reactions with this plasma. For example, protonation occurs by

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + e^- -&gt; CH4+ + 2e^-&lt;/chem&gt; (primary ion formation),

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + CH4+ -&gt; CH5+ + CH3&lt;/chem&gt; (reagent ion formation),

:&lt;chem&gt;M + CH5+ -&gt; CH4 + [M + H]+&lt;/chem&gt; (product ion formation, e.g. protonation).

===Charge exchange ionization===

Charge-exchange ionization (also known as charge-transfer ionization) is a gas phase reaction between an ion and an atom or molecule in which the charge of the ion is transferred to the neutral species.

:&lt;chem&gt;A+ + B -&gt; A + B+&lt;/chem&gt;

===Chemi-ionization===
Chemi-ionization is the formation of an ion through the reaction of a gas phase atom or molecule with an atom or molecule in an excited state. Chemi-ionization can be represented by
:&lt;chem&gt;G^\ast{} + M -&gt; G{} + M^{+\bullet}{} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;
where G is the excited state species (indicated by the superscripted asterisk), and M is the species that is ionized by the loss of an electron to form the radical cation (indicated by the superscripted &quot;plus-dot&quot;).

===Associative ionization===
Associative ionization is a gas phase reaction in which two atoms or molecules interact to form a single product ion. One or both of the interacting species may have excess internal energy.

For example,

:&lt;chem&gt;A^\ast{} + B -&gt; AB^{+\bullet}{} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;

where species A with excess internal energy (indicated by the asterisk) interacts with B to form the ion AB+.

===Penning ionization===

Penning ionization is a form of chemi-ionization involving reactions between neutral atoms or molecules. The process is named after the Dutch physicist Frans Michel Penning who first reported it in 1927. Penning ionization involves a reaction between a gas-phase excited-state atom or molecule G* and a target molecule M resulting in the formation of a radical molecular cation M+., an electron e−, and a neutral gas molecule G:

:&lt;chem&gt;G^\ast{} + M -&gt; G{} + M^{+\bullet}{} + e^- &lt;/chem&gt;

Penning ionization occurs when the target molecule has an ionization potential lower than the internal energy of the excited-state atom or molecule.

Associative Penning ionization can proceed via

:&lt;chem&gt;G^\ast{} + M -&gt; MG^{+\bullet}{} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;

Surface Penning ionization (also known as Auger deexcitation) refers to the interaction of the excited-state gas with a bulk surface S, resulting in the release of an electron according to

:&lt;chem&gt;G^\ast{} + S -&gt; G{} + S{} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;.

===Ion attachment===

Ion-attachment ionization is similar to chemical ionization in which a cation is attached to the analyte molecule in a reactive collision:
:&lt;chem&gt;M + X+ + A -&gt; MX+ + A&lt;/chem&gt;

Where M is the analyte molecule, X+ is the cation and A is a non-reacting collision partner.

In a radioactive ion source, a small piece of radioactive material, for instance 63Ni or 241Am, is used to ionize a gas. This is used in ionization smoke detectors and ion mobility spectrometers.

==Gas-discharge ion sources==

These ion sources use a plasma source or electric discharge to create ions.

===Inductively-coupled plasma===

Ions can be created in an inductively coupled plasma, which is a plasma source in which the energy is supplied by electrical currents which are produced by electromagnetic induction, that is, by time-varying magnetic fields.
===Microwave-induced plasma===
Microwave induced plasma ion sources are capable of exciting electrodeless gas discharges to create ions for trace element mass spectrometry. A microwave plasma has high frequency electromagnetic radiation in the GHz range. It is capable of exciting electrodeless gas discharges. If applied in surface-wave-sustained mode, they are especially well suited to generate large-area plasmas of high plasma density. If they are both in surface-wave and resonator mode, they can exhibit a high degree of spatial localization. This allows to spatially separate the location of plasma generations from the location of surface processing. Such a separation (together with an appropriate gas-flow scheme) may help reduce the negative effect, that particles released from a processed substrate may have on the plasma chemistry of the gas phase.

===ECR ion source===

The ECR ion source makes use of the electron cyclotron resonance to ionize a plasma. Microwaves are injected into a volume at the frequency corresponding to the electron cyclotron resonance, defined by the magnetic field applied to a region inside the volume. The volume contains a low pressure gas.

===Glow discharge===
Ions can be created in an electric glow discharge. A glow discharge is a plasma formed by the passage of electric current through a low-pressure gas. It is created by applying a voltage between two metal electrodes in an evacuated chamber containing gas. When the voltage exceeds a certain value, called the striking voltage, the gas forms a plasma.

A duoplasmatron is a type of glow discharge ion source that consists of a hot cathode or cold cathode that produces a plasma that is used to ionize a gas. THey can produce positive or negative ions. They are used for secondary ion mass spectrometry, ion beam etching, and high-energy physics.

===Flowing afterglow===

In a flowing plasma afterglow, ions are formed in a flow of inert gas, typically helium or argon. Reagents are added downstream to create ion products and study reaction rates. Flowing-afterglow mass spectrometry is used for trace gas analysis for organic compounds.

===Spark ionization===

Electric spark ionization is used to produce gas phase ions from a solid sample. When incorporated with a mass spectrometer the complete instrument is referred to as a spark ionization mass spectrometer or as a spark source mass spectrometer (SSMS).

A closed drift ion source uses a radial magnetic field in an annular cavity in order to confine electrons for ionizing a gas. They are used for ion implantation and for space propulsion (Hall-effect thrusters).

==Photoionization==

Photoionization is the ionization process in which an ion is formed from the interaction of a photon with an atom or molecule.

===Multi-photon ionization===
In multi-photon ionization (MPI), several photons of energy below the ionization threshold may actually combine their energies to ionize an atom.

Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) is a form of MPI in which one or more of the photons accesses a bound-bound transition that is resonant in the atom or molecule being ionized.

===Atmospheric pressure photoionization===

Atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) uses a source of photons, usually a vacuum UV (VUV) lamp, to ionize the analyte with single photon ionization process. Analogous to other atmospheric pressure ion sources, a spray of solvent is heated to relatively high temperatures (above 400 degrees Celsius) and sprayed with high flow rates of nitrogen for desolvation. The resulting aerosol is subjected to UV radiation to create ions. Atmospheric-pressure laser ionization uses UV laser light sources to ionize the analyte via MPI.

==Desorption ionization==

===Field desorption===
Field desorption refers to an ion source in which a high-potential electric field is applied to an emitter with a sharp surface, such as a razor blade, or more commonly, a filament from which tiny &quot;whiskers&quot; have formed. This results in a very high electric field which can result in ionization of gaseous molecules of the analyte. Mass spectra produced by FI have little or no fragmentation. They are dominated by molecular radical cations and less often, protonated molecules 

===Particle bombardment===

====Fast atom bombardment====

Particle bombardment with atoms is called fast atom bombardment (FAB) and bombardment with atomic or molecular ions is called secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Fission fragment ionization uses ionic or neutral atoms formed as a result of the nuclear fission of a suitable nuclide, for example the Californium isotope 252Cf.

In FAB the analytes is mixed with a non-volatile chemical protection environment called a matrix and is bombarded under vacuum with a high energy (4000 to 10,000 electron volts) beam of atoms. The atoms are typically from an inert gas such as argon or xenon. Common matrices include glycerol, thioglycerol, 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (3-NBA), 18-crown-6 ether, 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether, sulfolane, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine. This technique is similar to secondary ion mass spectrometry and plasma desorption mass spectrometry.

====Secondary ionization====

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is used to analyze the composition of solid surfaces and thin films by sputtering the surface of the specimen with a focused primary ion beam and collecting and analyzing ejected secondary ions. The mass/charge ratios of these secondary ions are measured with a mass spectrometer to determine the elemental, isotopic, or molecular composition of the surface to a depth of 1 to 2 nm.

In a liquid metal ion source (LMIS), a metal (typically gallium) is heated to the liquid state and provided at the end of a capillary or a needle. Then a Taylor cone is formed under the application of a strong electric field. As the cone&#x27;s tip get sharper, the electric field becomes stronger, until ions are produced by field evaporation. These ion sources are particularly used in ion implantation or in focused ion beam instruments.

====Plasma desorption ionization====

Plasma desorption ionization mass spectrometry (PDMS), also called fission fragment ionization, is a mass spectrometry technique in which ionization of material in a solid sample is accomplished by bombarding it with ionic or neutral atoms formed as a result of the nuclear fission of a suitable nuclide, typically the californium isotope 252Cf.

===Laser desorption ionization===
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is a soft ionization technique. The sample is mixed with a matrix material. Upon receiving a laser pulse, the matrix absorbs the laser energy and it is thought that primarily the matrix is desorbed and ionized (by addition of a proton) by this event. The analyte molecules are also desorbed. The matrix is then thought to transfer proton to the analyte molecules (e.g., protein molecules), thus charging the analyte.

====Surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization====
Surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization (SALDI) is a soft laser desorption technique used for analyzing biomolecules by mass spectrometry. In its first embodiment, it used graphite matrix. At present, laser desorption/ionization methods using other inorganic matrices, such as nanomaterials, are often regarded as SALDI variants. A related method named &quot;ambient SALDI&quot; - which is a combination of conventional SALDI with ambient mass spectrometry incorporating the DART ion source - has also been demonstrated.

====Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization====

Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) is a variant of MALDI that is used for the analysis of protein mixtures that uses a target modified to achieve biochemical affinity with the analyte compound.

====Desorption ionization on silicon====

Desorption ionization on silicon (DIOS) refers to laser desorption/ionization of a sample deposited on a porous silicon surface.

====Smalley source====
A laser vaporization cluster source produces ions using a combination of laser desorption ionization and supersonic expansion. The Smalley source (or Smalley cluster source) was developed by Richard Smalley at Rice University in the 1980s and was central to the discovery of fullerenes in 1985.

====Aerosol ionization====
In aerosol mass spectrometry with time-of-flight analysis, micrometer sized solid aerosol particles extracted from the atmosphere are simultaneously desorbed and ionized by a precisely timed laser pulse as they pass through the center of a time-of-flight ion extractor.

==Spray ionization==

Spray ionization methods involve the formation of aerosol particles from a liquid solution and the formation of bare ions after solvent evaporation.

Solvent-assisted ionization (SAI) is a method in which charged droplets are produced by introducing a solution containing analyte into a heated inlet tube of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer. Just as in Electrospray Ionization (ESI), desolvation of the charged droplets produces multiply charged analyte ions. Volatile and nonvolatile compounds are analyzed by SAI, and high voltage is not required to achieve sensitivity comparable to ESI. Application of a voltage to the solution entering the hot inlet through a zero dead volume fitting connected to fused silica tubing produces ESI-like mass spectra, but with higher sensitivity. The inlet tube to the mass spectrometer becomes the ion source.

===Matrix-Assisted Ionization===
Matrix-Assisted Ionization (MAI) is similar to MALDI in sample preparation, but a laser is not required to convert analyte molecules included in a matrix compound into gas-phase ions. In MAI, analyte ions have charge states similar to electrospray ionization but obtained from a solid matrix rather than a solvent. No voltage or laser is required, but a laser can be used to obtain spatial resolution for imaging. Matrix-analyte samples are ionized in the vacuum of a mass spectrometer and can be inserted into the vacuum through an atmospheric pressure inlet. Less volatile matrices such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid require a hot inlet tube to produce analyte ions by MAI, but more volatile matrices such as 3-nitrobenzonitrile require no heat, voltage, or laser. Simply introducing the matrix-analyte sample to the inlet aperture of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer produces abundant ions. Compounds at least as large as bovine serum albumin [66 kDa] can be ionized with this method. In this method, the inlet to the mass spectrometer can be considered the ion source.

===Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization===

Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization uses a solvent spray at atmospheric pressure. A spray of solvent is heated to relatively high temperatures (above 400 degrees Celsius), sprayed with high flow rates of nitrogen and the entire aerosol cloud is subjected to a corona discharge that creates ions with the evaporated solvent acting as the chemical ionization reagent gas. APCI is not as &quot;soft&quot; (low fragmentation) an ionization technique as ESI. Note that atmospheric pressure ionization (API) should not be used as a synonym for APCI.

===Thermospray ionization===

Thermospray ionization is a form of atmospheric pressure ionization in mass spectrometry. It transfers ions from the liquid phase to the gas phase for analysis. It is particularly useful in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

===Electrospray ionization===

In electrospray ionization, a liquid is pushed through a very small, charged and usually metal, capillary. This liquid contains the substance to be studied, the analyte, dissolved in a large amount of solvent, which is usually much more volatile than the analyte. Volatile acids, bases or buffers are often added to this solution as well. The analyte exists as an ion in solution either in its anion or cation form. Because like charges repel, the liquid pushes itself out of the capillary and forms an aerosol, a mist of small droplets about 10 μm across. The aerosol is at least partially produced by a process involving the formation of a Taylor cone and a jet from the tip of this cone. An uncharged carrier gas such as nitrogen is sometimes used to help nebulize the liquid and to help evaporate the neutral solvent in the droplets. As the solvent evaporates, the analyte molecules are forced closer together, repel each other and break up the droplets. This process is called Coulombic fission because it is driven by repulsive Coulombic forces between charged molecules. The process repeats until the analyte is free of solvent and is a bare ion. The ions observed are created by the addition of a proton (a hydrogen ion) and denoted , or of another cation such as sodium ion, , or the removal of a proton, . Multiply charged ions such as are often observed. For macromolecules, there can be many charge states, occurring with different frequencies; the charge can be as great as , for example.

====Probe electrospray ionization====

Probe electrospray ionization (PESI) is a modified version of electrospray, where the capillary for sample solution transferring is replaced by a sharp-tipped solid needle with periodic motion.

===Contactless atmospheric pressure ionization===

Contactless atmospheric pressure ionization is a technique used for analysis of liquid and solid samples by mass spectrometry. Contactless API can be operated without an additional electric power supply (supplying voltage to the source emitter), gas supply, or syringe pump. Thus, the technique provides a facile means for analyzing chemical compounds by mass spectrometry at atmospheric pressure.

===Sonic spray ionization===

Sonic spray ionization is method for creating ions from a liquid solution, for example, a mixture of methanol and water. A pneumatic nebulizer is used to turn the solution into a supersonic spray of small droplets. Ions are formed when the solvent evaporates and the statistically unbalanced charge distribution on the droplets leads to a net charge and complete desolvation results in the formation of ions. Sonic spray ionization is used to analyze small organic molecules and drugs and can analyze large molecules when an electric field is applied to the capillary to help increase the charge density and generate multiple charged ions of proteins.

Sonic spray ionization has been coupled with high performance liquid chromatography for the analysis of drugs. Oligonucleotides have been studied with this method. SSI has been used in a manner similar to desorption electrospray ionization for ambient ionization and has been coupled with thin-layer chromatography in this manner.

===Ultrasonication-assisted spray ionization===

Ultrasonication-assisted spray ionization (UASI) is similar to the above techniques but uses an ultrasonic transducer to achieve atomization of the material and generate ions.

==Thermal ionization==

Thermal ionization (also known as surface ionization, or contact ionization) involves spraying vaporized, neutral atoms onto a hot surface, from which the atoms re-evaporate in ionic form. To generate positive ions, the atomic species should have a low ionization energy, and the surface should have a high work function. This technique is most suitable for alkali atoms (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) which have low ionization energies and are easily evaporated.

To generate negative ions, the atomic species should have a high electron affinity, and the surface should have a low work function. This second approach is most suited for halogen atoms Cl, Br, I, At.

==Ambient ionization==
In ambient ionization, ions are formed outside the mass spectrometer without sample preparation or separation. Ions can be formed by extraction into charged electrospray droplets, thermally desorbed and ionized by chemical ionization, or laser desorbed or ablated and post-ionized before they enter the mass spectrometer.

Solid-liquid extraction based ambient ionization uses a charged spray to create a liquid film on the sample surface. Molecules on the surface are extracted into the solvent. The action of the primary droplets hitting the surface produces secondary droplets that are the source of ions for the mass spectrometer. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) creates charged droplets that are directed at a solid sample a few millimeters to a few centimeters away. The charged droplets pick up the sample through interaction with the surface and then form highly charged ions that can be sampled into a mass spectrometer.

Plasma-based ambient ionization is based on an electrical discharge in a flowing gas that produces metastable atoms and molecules and reactive ions. Heat is often used to assist in the desorption of volatile species from the sample. Ions are formed by chemical ionization in the gas phase. A direct analysis in real time (DART) source operates by exposing the sample to a dry gas stream (typically helium or nitrogen) that contains long-lived electronically or vibronically excited neutral atoms or molecules (or &quot;metastables&quot;). Excited states are typically formed in the DART source by creating a glow discharge in a chamber through which the gas flows. A similar method called atmospheric solids analysis probe (ASAP) uses the heated gas from ESI or APCI probes to vaporize sample placed on a melting point tube inserted into an ESI/APCI source. Ionization is by APCI.

Laser-based ambient ionization is a two-step process in which a pulsed laser is used to desorb or ablate material from a sample and the plume of material interacts with an electrospray or plasma to create ions. Electrospray-assisted laser desorption/ionization (ELDI) uses a 337 nm UV laser or 3 μm infrared laser to desorb material into an electrospray source. Matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (MALDESI) is an atmospheric pressure ionization source for generation of multiply charged ions. An ultraviolet or infrared laser is directed onto a solid or liquid sample containing the analyte of interest and matrix desorbing neutral analyte molecules that are ionized by interaction with electrosprayed solvent droplets generating multiply charged ions. Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) is an ambient ionization method for mass spectrometry that combines laser ablation from a mid-infrared (mid-IR) laser with a secondary electrospray ionization (ESI) process.

==Applications==

===Mass spectrometry===

In a mass spectrometer a sample is ionized in an ion source and the resulting ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio. The ions are detected and the results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.

===Particle accelerators===

In particle accelerators an ion source creates a particle beam at the beginning of the machine, the &quot;source&quot;. The technology to create ion sources for particle accelerators depends strongly on the type of particle that needs to be generated: electrons, protons, H− ion or a Heavy ions.

Electrons are generated with an electron gun, of which there are many varieties.

Protons are generated with a plasma-based device, like a duoplasmatron or a magnetron.

H− ions are generated with a magnetron or a Penning source. A magnetron consists of a central cylindrical cathode surrounded by an anode. The discharge voltage is typically greater than 150 V and the current drain is around 40 A. A magnetic field of about 0.2 tesla is parallel to the cathode axis. Hydrogen gas is introduced by a pulsed gas valve. Caesium is often used to lower the work function of the cathode, enhancing the amount of ions that are produced. Large caesiated sources are also used for plasma heating in nuclear fusion devices.

For a Penning source, a strong magnetic field parallel to the electric field of the sheath guides electrons and ions on cyclotron spirals from cathode to cathode. Fast H-minus ions are generated at the cathodes as in the magnetron. They are slowed down due to the charge exchange reaction as they migrate to the plasma aperture. This makes for a beam of ions that is colder than the ions obtained from a magnetron.

Heavy ions can be generated with an electron cyclotron resonance ion source. The use of electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion sources for the production of intense beams of highly charged ions has immensely grown over the last decade. ECR ion sources are used as injectors into linear accelerators, Van-de-Graaff generators or cyclotrons in nuclear and elementary particle physics. In atomic and surface physics ECR ion sources deliver intense beams of highly charged ions for collision experiments or for the investigation of surfaces. For the highest charge states, however, Electron beam ion sources (EBIS) are needed. They can generate even bare ions of mid-heavy elements. The Electron beam ion trap (EBIT), based on the same principle, can produce up to bare uranium ions and can be used as an ion source as well.

Heavy ions can also be generated with an ion gun which typically uses the thermionic emission of electrons to ionize a substance in its gaseous state. Such instruments are typically used for surface analysis.

Gas flows through the ion source between the anode and the cathode. A positive voltage is applied to the anode. This voltage, combined with the high magnetic field between the tips of the internal and external cathodes allow a plasma to start. Ions from the plasma are repelled by the anode&#x27;s electric field. This creates an ion beam.

<doc id="326388" wikidata="Q220015" url="?curid=326388" title="Weekly Shōnen Jump">
<text>is a weekly &quot;shōnen&quot; manga anthology published in Japan by Shueisha under the &quot;Jump&quot; line of magazines. The manga series within the magazine consist of many action scenes and a fair amount of comedy. Chapters of the series that run in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; are collected and published in volumes under the &quot;Jump Comics&quot; imprint every two to three months. It is one of the longest-running manga magazines, with the first issue being released with a cover date of August 1, 1968.

The magazine has sold over 7.5billion copies since 1968, making it the best-selling comic/manga magazine, ahead of competitors such as &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; and &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. The mid-1980s to the mid-1990s represents the era when the magazine&#x27;s circulation was at its highest, 6.53million copies per week, with a total readership of people in Japan. Throughout 2021, it had an average circulation of over copies per week. Many of the best-selling manga series—including &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot;—originate from &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;.

&quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; has sister magazines such as &quot;Jump SQ&quot;, V Jump, &quot;Saikyō Jump&quot;, and digital counterpart &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; which boasts its own exclusive titles. The magazine has also had several international counterparts, including the North American &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;. It also spawned a crossover media franchise including anime and (since &quot;Famicom Jump&quot;) which bring together various &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; characters.

==History==
===Origins (1960s–1970s)===
&quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; was launched by Shueisha on July 11, 1968, to compete with the already-successful &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; and &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;″s sister publication was a manga magazine called &quot;Shōnen Book&quot;, which was originally a male version of the short-lived &quot;shōjo&quot; manga anthology &quot;Shōjo Book&quot;. Prior to issue 20, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; was originally called simply &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; as it was originally a bi-weekly magazine. In 1969, &quot;Shōnen Book&quot; ceased publication at which time &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; became a weekly magazine and a new monthly magazine called &quot;Bessatsu Shōnen Jump&quot; was made to take &quot;Shōnen Book&quot;″s place. This magazine was later rebranded as &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot; before eventually being discontinued and replaced by &quot;Jump SQ&quot;.

=== Golden age (1980s–1990s) ===
Hiroki Goto was appointed chief editor in 1986 and remained in the position until 1993. His tenure saw significant increases in circulation, and the serialization of numerous popular series. When asked about the period, Goto stated: &quot;We only tried to create manga that everybody can enjoy. There were no specific rules. Idol and tabloid magazines dominated in the Media &amp; Entertainment industry at that time and we aimed to stand out from the crowd by using only manga as our weapon.&quot; &quot;Famicom Jump: Hero Retsuden&quot;, released in 1988 for the Family Computer was produced to commemorate the magazine&#x27;s 20th anniversary. It was followed by a sequel: &quot;Famicom Jump II: Saikyō no Shichinin&quot; in 1991, also for the Family Computer.
Shōnen Jump&#x27;s circulation continued to increase year on year until 1995, peaking at 6.53 million copies. By 1998, circulation had dropped to 4.15 million copies, a decline in part ascribed to the conclusion of popular manga series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;. The magazine peaked with a total readership of people in Japan during the early 1990s.

===Declining circulation (2000–2013)===
Circulation for the magazine continued to decline through the early 2000s, before reaching some stability around 2005, well below its earlier peak. In 2000, two more games were created for the purpose of commemorating the magazine&#x27;s anniversaries. A crossover fighting game titled &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; was released for the Nintendo DS in 2005. It was followed by &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot; in 2006. Due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the shipment of the 15th issue of 2011 was delayed in some areas of Japan. In response, Shueisha published the series included in that issue for free on its website from March 23 to April 27.

On July 11, 2013, the Namco Bandai Group opened an amusement park themed around &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; series. Titled J-World Tokyo, it is located on the third floor of the Sunshine City World Import Mart Building in Ikebukuro and is 1.52 acres. In celebration of the magazine&#x27;s 45th anniversary in 2013, Shueisha began a contest where anyone can submit manga in three different languages, Japanese, English and Chinese. Judged by the magazine&#x27;s editorial department, four awards will be given, a grand prize and one for each language, each including 500,000 yen (about US$4,900) and guaranteed publication in either &quot;Jump&quot;, its special editions, North American edition, China&#x27;s &quot;OK! Comic&quot;, or Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Formosa Youth&quot;.

===Transition to digital (2013–present)===

A mobile phone app titled &quot;Jump Live&quot; was launched in August 2013, it features exclusive content from the artists whose series run in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. On September 22, 2014, the free mobile app and website was launched in Japan. It sells digital versions of the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine, simultaneous with its print release, and volumes of individual &quot;Jump&quot; series past and present. However, it also has large samples of the manga that can be read for free. There are also series that are serialized exclusively on the app, such as &quot;Marvel × Shōnen Jump+ Super Collaboration&quot;; unlike those in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, these series may be aimed at adult men or women. These exclusive series are later published in print volumes under the Jump Comics+ imprint. In 2019, the &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; website and app had about 2.4 million active users. As of January 2020, the app had been downloaded more than 13 million times.

As the magazine shifted towards digital provision, print circulation once again began to decline. By 2017, print circulation was down to under two million, less than a third of its peak during the golden age. This decline follows similar trends seen by other magazines in the sector.

A new crossover game, &quot;J-Stars Victory Vs.&quot;, was released in 2014 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita to commemorate Jump&#x27;s 45 anniversary. In June 2018, a limited 50th Anniversary &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; Edition of the Famicom Mini (NES Classic Edition) game console was released in Japan. It sold 110,000 units in two days.

On January 28, 2019, Shueisha launched the global English-language version of &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot;, titled &quot;Manga Plus&quot;. It is freely available in every country except China and South Korea, which have their own separate services. A Spanish-language version was launched in February 2019, and has a different library of content. Like the Japanese app, it has large samples of manga that can be read for free including all the current titles of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, a sizeable number of titles from &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; and some titles from &quot;Jump Square&quot;. However, unlike the Japanese version, the latest chapters of current &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; manga are made available free for a limited-time and it does not sell content.

==Newcomer Awards==

&quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, in association with parent company Shueisha, holds annual competitions for new or up and coming manga artists to create one-shot stories. The best are put to a panel of judges (including manga artists past and present) where the best are given a special award for the best of these new series. The &quot;Tezuka Award&quot;, named for manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka, is given for all different styles of stories. The &quot;Akatsuka Award&quot;, named for gag manga pioneer Fujio Akatsuka, is a similar competition for comedy and gag manga. Many &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; manga artists have gotten their start either winning or being acknowledged by these competitions.

==Circulation and demographic==
&quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; is the bestselling manga magazine in Japan. In 1982, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; had a circulation of 2.55 million. By 1995, circulation numbers swelled to 6.53 million. The magazine&#x27;s former editor-in-chief Masahiko Ibaraki (2003–2008) stated this was due to the magazine including &quot;hit titles such as &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, and others.&quot; After hitting this peak, the circulation numbers continued to drop. 1998&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s issue was the first time in 24 years that &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; lost as the highest selling &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazine (4.15 million copies sold), ceding to &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; (4.45 million). It was not until 2007 that the magazine saw its first increase in 11 years, from 2.75 million to 2.78 million, an increase that Ibaraki credited to &quot;One Piece&quot;.

By publishing &quot;shōnen&quot; manga, the magazine is targeted to young teen males. However, Index Digital reported in 2005 that the favorite non-&quot;shōjo&quot; magazine of elementary and middle school-aged female readers is &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; at 61.9%. Strengthening it, Oricon conducted a poll among 2,933 female Japanese readers on their favorite manga magazines in 2007. &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; was the number one answer, with &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Death Note&quot;, and &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; cited as the reasons. In 2009, it was reported that 62.9% of the magazine&#x27;s readers were under the age of fourteen. However, in 2019 Shueisha revealed that its largest demographic of 27.4% was aged 25 or older.

===&quot;Jump Giga&quot;===
 is a special seasonal offshoot of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; launched on July 20, 2016. Its original predecessor started in 1969 as a regular special issue of the bi-weekly &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot;. When &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; became a weekly publication and was renamed &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in October of that same year, the special issue changed to a quarterly release and kept the shorter name. In the mid-1980s, the magazine took on the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; name with each issue subtitled the Spring, Summer, Autumn, or Winter &quot;Special&quot;. 

Beginning in 1996, it was published three times a year for Golden Week, Obon and New Years under the name until April 30, 2010, when it was renamed . &quot;Jump Next!&quot; has had several other past special versions:
* was a single issue of &quot;Akamaru Jump&quot;. One-shots that were featured in &quot;Aomaru Jump&quot; were &quot;Dead/Undead&quot;, &quot;Shōgai Oyaji Michi!&quot;, &quot;The Dream&quot;, &quot;Mieruhito&quot;, &quot;Yūtō ☆ Hōshi&quot;, and &quot;Fuku wa Jutsu&quot;.
* was a special edition of &quot;Akamaru Jump&quot; that was published in two issues in November 2005 and 2006. &quot;Jump the Revolution!&quot; contained one-shots of upcoming &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; series and soon to be &quot;Jump SQ&quot; series.

In 2012 it returned to a quarterly schedule. A second exclamation point was added to the title in March 2014, when it switched to a bi-monthly release. After relaunching as &quot;Jump Giga&quot;, the magazine published four issues or &quot;volumes&quot; in 2016 and 2017, six in 2018 and 2019 (three in summer and three in winter), and seems to have returned to a seasonal quarterly release since 2020.

&quot;Jump Giga&quot; features many amateur manga artists who get their one-shots published in the magazine. It also puts additional one-shot titles by professional manga artists, which promote upcoming series to be published in the main magazine. It has also featured the last chapters of cancelled series from &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump,&quot; such as &quot;Enigma&quot; and &quot;Magico&quot;. It also features yonkoma of popular series such as &quot;Death Note&quot; and &quot;Naruto&quot;, as well as the pilot chapter of &quot;Bleach&quot;. Final epilogue chapters of The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. and Food Wars: Shokugeki no Soma were also featured, while Gintama and Black Clover were transferred to allow for their completion.

<doc id="326395" wikidata="Q756946" url="?curid=326395" title="Lagrange's four-square theorem">
<text>Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem, also known as Bachet&#x27;s conjecture, states that every nonnegative integer can be represented as a sum of four non-negative integer squares. That is, the squares form an additive basis of order four:
formula_1 
where the four numbers formula_2 are integers. For illustration, 3, 31, and 310 can be represented as the sum of four squares as follows:
formula_3

This theorem was proven by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1770. It is a special case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem.

==Historical development==
From examples given in the &quot;Arithmetica,&quot; it is clear that Diophantus was aware of the theorem. This book was translated in 1621 into Latin by Bachet (Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac), who stated the theorem in the notes of his translation. But the theorem was not proved until 1770 by Lagrange.

Adrien-Marie Legendre extended the theorem in 1797–8 with his three-square theorem, by proving that a positive integer can be expressed as the sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form formula_4 for integers and . Later, in 1834, Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi discovered a simple formula for the number of representations of an integer as the sum of four squares with his own four-square theorem.

The formula is also linked to Descartes&#x27; theorem of four &quot;kissing circles&quot;, which involves the sum of the squares of the curvatures of four circles. This is also linked to Apollonian gaskets, which were more recently related to the Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture.

== Proofs ==

=== The classical proof ===
Several very similar modern versions of Lagrange&#x27;s proof exist. The proof below is a slightly simplified version, in which the cases for which &quot;m&quot; is even or odd do not require separate arguments.

=== Proof using the Hurwitz integers ===
Another way to prove the theorem relies on Hurwitz quaternions, which are the analog of integers for quaternions. 

==Generalizations==
Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem is a special case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem and Waring&#x27;s problem. Another possible generalization is the following problem: Given natural numbers formula_5, can we solve

formula_6

for all positive integers in integers formula_7? The case formula_8 is answered in the positive by Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem. The general solution was given by Ramanujan. He proved that if we assume, without loss of generality, that formula_9 then there are exactly 54 possible choices for formula_5 such that the problem is solvable in integers formula_7 for all . (Ramanujan listed a 55th possibility formula_12, but in this case the problem is not solvable if formula_13.)

==Algorithms==

In 1986, Michael O. Rabin and Jeffrey Shallit proposed randomized polynomial-time algorithms for computing a single representation formula_14 for a given integer , in expected running time formula_15. It was further improved to formula_16 by Paul Pollack and Enrique Treviño in 2018.

==Number of representations==

The number of representations of a natural number &quot;n&quot; as the sum of four squares of integers is denoted by &quot;r&quot;4(&quot;n&quot;). Jacobi&#x27;s four-square theorem states that this is eight times the sum of the divisors of &quot;n&quot; if &quot;n&quot; is odd and 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of &quot;n&quot; if &quot;n&quot; is even (see divisor function), i.e.

formula_17

Equivalently, it is eight times the sum of all its divisors which are not divisible by 4, i.e.

formula_18

We may also write this as
formula_19
where the second term is to be taken as zero if &quot;n&quot; is not divisible by 4. In particular, for a prime number &quot;p&quot; we have the explicit formula .

Some values of &quot;r&quot;4(&quot;n&quot;) occur infinitely often as whenever &quot;n&quot; is even. The values of &quot;r&quot;4(&quot;n&quot;)/&quot;n&quot; can be arbitrarily large: indeed, &quot;r&quot;4(&quot;n&quot;)/&quot;n&quot; is infinitely often larger than 8.

==Uniqueness==
The sequence of positive integers which have only one representation as a sum of four squares of non-negative integers (up to order) is:

:1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 23, 24, 32, 56, 96, 128, 224, 384, 512, 896 ... .

These integers consist of the seven odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 23 and all numbers of the form formula_20 or formula_21.

The sequence of positive integers which cannot be represented as a sum of four &quot;non-zero&quot; squares is:

:1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 24, 29, 32, 41, 56, 96, 128, 224, 384, 512, 896 ... .

These integers consist of the eight odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 29, 41 and all numbers of the form formula_20 or formula_21.

==Further refinements==
Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem can be refined in various ways. For example, Zhi-Wei Sun proved that each natural number can be written as a sum of four squares with some requirements on the choice of these four numbers.

One may also wonder whether it is necessary to use the entire set of square integers to write each natural as the sum of four squares. Eduard Wirsing proved that there exists a set of squares with formula_24 such that every positive integer smaller than or equal to can be written as a sum of at most 4 elements of .

<doc id="326401" wikidata="Q17020147" url="?curid=326401" title="Royal Military College, Sandhurst">
<text>The Royal Military College (RMC), founded in 1801 and established in 1802 at Great Marlow and High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England, but moved in October 1812 to Sandhurst, Berkshire, was a British Army military academy for training infantry and cavalry officers of the British and Indian Armies.

The RMC was reorganised at the outbreak of the Second World War, but some of its units remained operational at Sandhurst and Aldershot. In 1947, the Royal Military College was merged with the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, to form the present-day all-purpose Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

==History==


Pre-dating the college, the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, had been established in 1741 to train artillery and engineer officers, but there was no such provision for training infantry and cavalry officers.

The Royal Military College was conceived by Colonel John Le Marchant, whose scheme for establishing schools for the military instruction of officers at High Wycombe and Great Marlow first met strong resistance on the grounds of cost.

There were already some small private military academies for aspiring infantry and cavalry officers in existence, notably one which had been operated at Chelsea by Lewis Lochée from about 1770 until he closed the academy in 1790, but none of them had any formal approval by the British government.

In 1799, Le Marchant established a school for staff officers at High Wycombe. In 1801, Parliament voted a grant of £30,000 for his more ambitious proposals, and in 1801 the school for staff officers at High Wycombe became the Senior Department of the new Military College. In 1802, having been appointed as the first Lieutenant Governor of the College, Le Marchant opened its Junior Department at a large house called Remnantz in West Street, Great Marlow, to train gentleman cadets for the infantry and cavalry regiments of the British Army and for the presidency armies of British India. 1802 was the same year as the founding of the French Army&#x27;s Saint-Cyr and of West Point in the United States. General Sir William Harcourt was appointed as the first Governor of the Royal Military College at Great Marlow and continued in post until 1811.

In January 1809, the East India Company established its own East India Military Seminary at Addiscombe to train officers for its armies.

In 1812, the College&#x27;s Junior Department moved from Great Marlow into purpose-built buildings at Sandhurst designed by James Wyatt, and was soon joined there by the Senior Department, migrating from High Wycombe. In 1858 this became a separate institution, the Staff College.

On the outbreak of the Second World War, many of the cadets and staff of the Royal Military College were mobilised for active service, but the buildings at Sandhurst remained the home of the RMC&#x27;s 161 Infantry Officer Cadet Training Unit. In 1942, this unit moved to Mons Barracks, Aldershot, and for the rest of the war the Sandhurst campus was used as a Royal Armoured Corps Officer Cadet Training Unit.

In 1947, a new Royal Military Academy Sandhurst was formed on the site of the Royal Military College, merging the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (which had trained officers for the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers from 1741 to 1939) and the Royal Military College (1802 to 1942), with the objective of providing officer training for all arms and services.

The Royal Military College was originally led by a governor, who was a figurehead, often non-resident, a lieutenant governor, who had actual day-to-day command of the college, and a commandant, who was the officer in charge of the cadets. In 1812, the posts of Lieutenant Governor and Commandant were merged into the role of Commandant. In 1888 the two remaining senior posts, Governor and Commandant, were merged into the single appointment of Governor and Commandant, which in 1902 was retitled as &quot;Commandant&quot;.

<doc id="326405" wikidata="Q784389" url="?curid=326405" title="Thrapston">
<text>Thrapston is a market town and civil parish in the North Northamptonshire unitary authority area of Northamptonshire, England. It was the headquarters of the former East Northamptonshire district, and at the time of the 2021 census, had a population of 7,238.

The town&#x27;s name means &#x27;Farmstead or town of a man named Thraepst&#x27;. Another source suggests the individual name is related with Old Germanic &#x27;Trapsta&#x27;, &#x27;Trafstila&#x27; and &#x27;thrafstjan&#x27; meaning &#x27;to comfort:, henceforth &#x27;farmstead or town of a man named Draefst or Draepst&#x27;.

Thrapston is situated close to the River Nene, where the pronunciation changes from nene to neen and is at the junction of the A14 and the A45. Until the 1960s, Thrapston had two railway stations. Thrapston (Midland) was on the Kettering to Cambridge route, and the former station and viaduct can be seen from the adjacent A14 road. Thrapston (Bridge Street) was on the former LNWR Northampton to Peterborough line.

A market charter was granted to the town in 1205, in exchange for two palfreys. This is celebrated every year with the town&#x27;s Charter fair, when the high street is closed and the townspeople congregate in commemoration. A relative of George Washington, Sir John Washington, lived in Chancery Lane in the town, and his wife is buried in the Church of St James. Sir John was brother to George Washington&#x27;s great-grandfather. Naturalist and writer Horace William Wheelwright practised as an attorney in Thrapston in the 1840s. The Corn Exchange, on the north side of the High Street, was completed in 1850.
Thrapston had two schools, Thrapston Primary and King John Middle School, which together served children from Nursery to Year 8. However, in 2015, East Northamptonshire switched to a two-tier school system resulting in the middle schools closing. As King John School closed, Thrapston Primary School expanded into the King John building, in order to accommodate the year 5 and 6 children. Following this, children usually go to Prince William school in Oundle or another school in the area from year 7 onwards.

The local authorities that cover different aspects of civic life in Thrapston are Thrapston Town Council, and North Northamptonshire Council.

*Henry de Thrapston (died c.1333), English-born judge and Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland

<doc id="326413" wikidata="Q5193851" url="?curid=326413" title="List of exceptional asteroids">
<text>The following is a collection of lists of asteroids of the Solar System that are exceptional in some way, such as their size or orbit. For the purposes of this article, &quot;asteroid&quot; refers to minor planets out to the orbit of Neptune, and includes the dwarf planet Ceres, the Jupiter trojans and the centaurs, but not trans-Neptunian objects (objects in the Kuiper belt, scattered disc or inner Oort cloud). For a complete list of minor planets in numerical order, see List of minor planets.

Asteroids are given minor planet numbers, but not all minor planets are asteroids. Minor planet numbers are also given to objects of the Kuiper belt, which is similar to the asteroid belt but farther out (around 30–60 AU), whereas asteroids are mostly between 2–3 AU from the Sun or at the orbit of Jupiter 5 AU from the Sun. Also, comets are not typically included under minor planet numbers, and have their own naming conventions.

Asteroids are given a unique sequential identifying number once their orbit is precisely determined. Prior to this, they are known only by their systematic name or provisional designation, such as .

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Largest by diameter ===
Estimating the sizes of asteroids from observations is difficult due to their irregular shapes, varying albedo, and small angular diameter. Observations by the Very Large Telescope of most large asteroids were published 2019–2021.

The number of bodies grows rapidly as the size decreases. Based on IRAS data there are about 140 main-belt asteroids with a diameter greater than 120 km, which is approximately the transition point between surviving primordial asteroids and fragments thereof. For a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size.

The inner asteroid belt (defined as the region interior to the 3:1 Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU) has few large asteroids. Of those in the above list, only 4 Vesta, 19 Fortuna, 6 Hebe, 7 Iris and 9 Metis orbit there. (Sort table by mean distance.)

=== Most massive ===

Below are the sixteen most-massive measured asteroids. Ceres, at a third the estimated mass of the asteroid belt, is half again as massive as the next fifteen put together. The masses of asteroids are estimated from perturbations they induce on the orbits of other asteroids, except for asteroids that have been visited by spacecraft or have an observable moon, where a direct mass calculation is possible. Different sets of astrometric observations lead to different mass determinations; the biggest problem is accounting for the aggregate perturbations caused by all of the smaller asteroids.

The proportions assume that the total mass of the asteroid belt is , or .

Outside the top four, the ranking of all the asteroids is uncertain, as there is a great deal of overlap among the estimates. 

The largest asteroids with an accurately measured mass, because they have been studied by the probe &quot;Dawn&quot;, are 1 Ceres with a mass of , and 4 Vesta at . The third-largest asteroid with an accurately measured mass, because it has moons, is 87 Sylvia at . Other large asteroids with masses measured from their moons are 107 Camilla and 130 Elektra.

For a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size. Other large asteroids such as 423 Diotima currently only have estimated masses.

=== Brightest from Earth ===
Only Vesta is regularly bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Under ideal viewing conditions with very dark skies, a keen eye might be able to also see Ceres, as well as Pallas and Iris at their rare perihelic oppositions. The following asteroids can all reach an apparent magnitude brighter than or equal to the +8.3 attained by Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan at its brightest, which was discovered 145 years before the first asteroid was found owing to its closeness to the easily observed Saturn.

None of the asteroids in the outer part of the asteroid belt can ever attain this brightness. Even Hygiea and Interamnia rarely reach magnitudes of above 10.0. This is due to the different distributions of spectral types within different sections of the asteroid belt: the highest-albedo asteroids are all concentrated closer to the orbit of Mars, and much lower albedo C and D types are common in the outer belt.

Those asteroids with very high eccentricities will only reach their maximum magnitude rarely, when their perihelion is very close to a heliocentric conjunction with Earth, or (in the case of 99942 Apophis, , , and 367943 Duende) when the asteroid passes very close to Earth.

* Apophis will only achieve that brightness on April 13, 2029. It typically has an apparent magnitude of 20–22.

=== Slowest rotators ===
This list contains the slowest-rotating known minor planets with a period of at least 1000 hours, or 41 days, while most bodies have rotation periods between 2 and 20 hours. Also &quot;see Potentially slow rotators&quot; for minor planets with an insufficiently accurate period ().

=== Fastest rotators ===
This list contains the fastest-rotating minor planets with a period of less than 100 seconds, or 0.0277 hours. Bodies with a highly uncertain period, having a quality of less than 2, are highlighted in dark-grey. The fastest rotating bodies are all unnumbered near-Earth objects (NEOs) with a diameter of less than 100 meters &quot;(see table)&quot;.

Among the numbered minor planets with an unambiguous period solution are , a 60-meter sized stony NEO with a period of 352 seconds, as well as and , two main-belt asteroids, with a diameter of 0.86 and 2.25 kilometers and a period of 1.29 and 1.95 hours, respectively (&quot;see full list&quot;).

== Orbital characteristics ==

=== Retrograde ===

Minor planets with orbital inclinations near or greater than 90° (the greatest possible is 180°) orbit in a retrograde direction. , of the near-800,000 minor planets known, there are only 99 known retrograde minor planets (0.01% of total minor planets known). In comparison, there are over 2,000 comets with retrograde orbits. This makes retrograde minor planets the rarest group of all. High-inclination asteroids are either Mars-crossers (possibly in the process of being ejected from the Solar System) or damocloids. Some of these are temporarily captured in retrograde resonance with the gas giants.

 the value given when the number of observations is multiplied by the observation arc; larger values are generally better than smaller values depending on residuals.

=== Highly inclined ===
=== Trojans ===
* Earth trojans: and .
* Mars trojans: , 5261 Eureka, , , , , , and the candidate .
* Jupiter trojans: the first one was discovered in 1906, 588 Achilles, and the current total is over 6,000.

=== Landmark asteroids ===
=== Numbered minor planets that are also comets ===

The above table lists only numbered asteroids that are also comets. Note there are several cases where a non-numbered minor planets turned out to be a comet, e.g. C/2001 OG108 (LONEOS), which was provisionally designated .

=== Minor planets that were misnamed and renamed ===

In earlier times, before the modern numbering and naming rules were in effect, asteroids were sometimes given numbers and names before their orbits were precisely known. And in a few cases duplicate names were given to the same object (with modern use of computers to calculate and compare orbits with old recorded positions, this type of error no longer occurs). This led to a few cases where asteroids had to be renamed.
=== Landmark names ===
Asteroids were originally named after female mythological figures. Over time the rules loosened.

First asteroid with non-Classical and non-Latinized name: 64 Angelina (in honor of a research station)

First asteroid with a non-feminine name: 139 Juewa (ambiguous) or 141 Lumen

First asteroid with a non-feminized man&#x27;s name: 433 Eros

== Landmark numbers ==
Many landmark numbers had specially chosen names for asteroids, and there was some debate about whether Pluto should have received number 10000, for example. This list includes some non-asteroids.

<text>Kimbolton is a town and civil parish in the Huntingdonshire district of Cambridgeshire, England. Kimbolton is about west of Huntingdon and north of Bedford.

Kimbolton was also situated within historic Huntingdonshire when it was a county of England. The parish includes the hamlet of Stonely. Catherine of Aragon, after her divorce from Henry VIII, died at Kimbolton Castle in 1536.

==History==

Archaeological discoveries near to the airfield indicate the possible presence of a Roman settlement. The name Kimbolton, however, is Anglo-Saxon, translating as “Cenebald’s ton” (an enclosure or homestead).

Kimbolton, and the lands of its soke, comprised the only estate of King Harold in Huntingdonshire. It is believed that Harold had a hunting lodge nearby. The town was listed as &quot;Chenebaltone&quot; and &quot;Kenebaltone&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the Hundred of Leightonstone in Huntingdonshire. The survey records that there were 20 ploughlands at Kimbolton in 1086 and, in addition to the arable land, there were of meadows, of woodland and a water mill. There was already a church and a priest at Kimbolton.

The parish church of St Andrew is Grade I listed. Many members of the Montagu family (Earls and Dukes of Manchester of Kimbolton) are buried at St Andrew&#x27;s. Several Montagu monuments still exist in the South Chapel, while the Montagu vault (extended in 1853) is located beneath the North Chapel.

The main road through Kimbolton bends through four tight right angles in quick succession. Originally, the road travelled directly through the outskirts of the town, nearer to the River Kym to the north.

The parish also includes the hamlet of Stonely, site of the former Augustinian Stoneley Priory.

===Castle===

In the centre of the town is Kimbolton Castle which now forms the main building of Kimbolton School (an independent day and boarding secondary school), but its predecessor on the same site was once home and prison to Catherine of Aragon after her divorce from Henry VIII. Catherine died at Kimbolton Castle in 1536 and was transported from there to Peterborough Cathedral to be buried.

==Governance==
Kimbolton was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the town was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. Then in 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Kimbolton became a part of the administrative county of Cambridgeshire.

For Kimbolton the highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council. Kimbolton is part of the electoral division of &quot;Brampton and Kimbolton&quot; and is represented on the county council by one councillor. The second tier of local government is Huntingdonshire District Council, a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire. Kimbolton is a part of the district ward of &quot;Kimbolton and Staughton&quot; and is represented on the district council by one councillor. District councillors serve for four-year terms following elections to Huntingdonshire District Council. As a civil parish, Kimbolton has a parish council.

At Westminster, Kimbolton is in the parliamentary constituency of Huntingdon, and since 2024 has been represented in the House of Commons by Ben Obese-Jecty (Conservative).

==Demography==
===Population===
In the period 1801 to 1901 the population of Kimbolton was recorded every ten years by the UK census. During this time the population was in the range of 915 (the lowest was in 1901) and 1661 (the highest was in 1861).

From 1901, a census was taken every ten years with the exception of 1941 (due to the Second World War).

In 2011, the parish covered an area of and so the population density for Kimbolton in 2011 was 190.4 persons per square mile (73.5 per square kilometre).

In 2011 there are around 1,100 people living in the town&#x27;s built-up area, which excludes Stonely.

==Statute Fair and market==

=== Origin ===
The Statute Fair, referred to affectionately by locals as the &quot;Statty Fair&quot; or simply the &quot;Statty&quot;, is a fair held every September and has been characterised by one local historian as &quot;Dodgems, darts, candy floss and cuddly toys&quot;. The Kimbolton Statute Fair shares a wider history and heritage with similar statute fairs across England, dating back to the 1351 Statute of Labourers.

In 1200, a prominent local landowner, Geoffrey Fitz Peter, Earl of Essex and Chief Justice to King John, who constructed the first castle on the present site, received a Royal charter to hold a fair in Kimbolton on St Andrew&#x27;s Eve (and the two days hence), as well as a weekly market on Fridays. During the medieval period there were as many as five fairs in Kimbolton, with a &quot;Tandry Fair&quot; being held in the town for the sale of &quot;cattle and hogs&quot; until the 19th century.

During the medieval period a market cross was set up, around which market traders gathered to sell their goods - the foundations of which survive under the High Street. A plaque commemorating the cross exists near the war memorial. In 1603 the market cross was replaced with a wooden market hall - similar to the one at Ledbury - known as &quot;Butchers&#x27; Row&quot;, which survived until the 1870s, when it was demolished; by the 1890s the market has declined to the point where it had &quot;effectively disappeared&quot;.

By the end of the Victorian period, alongside Kimbolton&#x27;s declining population, only the Statute Fair remained of the numerous fairs. By no later than 1881 the fair&#x27;s purpose had changed from the traditional hiring fair to a recreational fete. One account from the Rev. Robert Kater Vinter in the 1881 Kimbolton School magazine described the &quot;wretched mixture&quot; of revellers travelling from neighbouring villages to drink, smoke and partake in all the fun of the fair - including a coconut shy, wooden carousel and an exhibition booth featuring real life Zulus. A later account from William Abington (b. 1903) recalled further attractions including hoopla, toffee and rock stalls, swinging boats, a joke toy stall and a tent that boasted the &quot;fattest women in the world&quot;.

=== Present day ===
In the present day the Statute Fair continues and is widely attended by students from the local school as well as those from other nearby schools and adults. It takes place on the High Street for one evening each September (unlike the three days granted by King John), and as such the High Street is closed for a 48-hour period, with traffic being redirected down St Andrew&#x27;s Lane and East Street. Modern attractions at the fair include bumper cars, a funhouse, inflatables and waltzers as well as fairground games, including the staple coconut shy; attendance is reported to be in the hundreds.

The continuation of the fair (despite the chaos which formerly ensued when this meant partial closure of a trunk road) and the plaque marking the site of the former market cross are claimed by some as evidence that Kimbolton is a town, as opposed to a village, and still has the right to hold a weekly market. The main road was diverted to its present course to take it through the market place and increase toll revenue. Eight hundred years later, as a result of numerous vehicles striking walls and houses near the sharp bends, car transporters are not allowed in the town. In 2020, the COVID-19 Pandemic limited the scale of the fair, even risking the fair not running for the first time in many years, far beyond living memory. One &#x27;teacups&#x27; ride was placed at the castle end of the high street to ensure the tradition would not cease.

==Facilities==
Kimbolton is known locally for its facilities, including High Street shopping, two public houses, a Budgens outlet (formerly Robinsons fuel station), fire station, a Post Office, a medical centre, a pharmacy, two cafe shops (Olivers and Crawfords), Whitchurch Wines and the Mandeville Hall, a charitable organisation providing facilities to the local community.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio East, Star Radio and HCR FM, a community based radio station. &quot;The Hunts Post&quot; is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

== Kimbolton railway station ==
The Kimbolton railway station was situated over two miles from the centre. It served the Midland Railway Kettering to Huntingdon Line. If travelling from London St. Pancras the journey would take approximately three hours, including a change at Kettering. The station and its line closed in 1959.

==Kimbolton Airfield==
In World War II, the USAAF 379th Bombardment Group was stationed at the nearby Kimbolton Airfield from May 1943 to June 1945. Part of the airfield is now used by Hunts Kart Racing Club. As of 2019, there is free and unsupervised access to the airfield for walkers. Remnants of old wartime bunkers are apparent across sections of the airfield.

==Kimbolton Fireworks==
Kimbolton Fireworks, a well-known manufacturer of fireworks and organiser of public fireworks displays, is based in Kimbolton. It grew from the extracurricular activities of Kimbolton School chaplain and chemistry master, Ron Lancaster, sometimes dubbed the &quot;master blaster pastor.&quot; In 2020, the popular firework display was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="326424" wikidata="Q7102067" url="?curid=326424" title="Organized Rhyme">
<text>Organized Rhyme was a Canadian hip hop group based in Ottawa, Ontario.

The group became one of the first Canadian rap acts to sign a record deal with a major label (A&amp;M Records) and the video for their debut single &quot;Check the O.R.&quot; won the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Rap Video in 1992. Comedian Tom Green was one of the group&#x27;s founding members.

== History ==
Organized Rhyme was formed in 1990 by Tom Green (a.k.a. MC Bones), Greg Campbell (a.k.a. MC Pin or Pin The Chameleon) and Geordie Ferguson (a.k.a. DJ Signal). The group signed with A&amp;M Records in 1991. The group released their debut album &quot;Huh!? Stiffenin Against the Wall&quot; in 1992. That same year the video for their first single &quot;Check the O.R.&quot;, won the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Rap Video. In 1993 &quot;Check the O.R.&quot; was also nominated for a Juno Award in the category of Best Rap Recording, but the song lost to &quot;Keep It Slammin&#x27;&quot; by Devon.

The group toured with such artists as The Barenaked Ladies, Dream Warriors and Maestro Fresh Wes. They disbanded shortly after the release of their first album.

Green&#x27;s 2005 rap album &quot;Prepare for Impact&quot; included a bonus DVD that contained both a live solo-performance of &quot;Check the O.R.&quot; as well as a recording of the original music video.

Organized Rhyme reunited and recorded a new video for &quot;Check the O.R.&quot; for the 2011 Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, Quebec.

Colleagues are those explicitly united in a common purpose and, at least in theory, respect each other&#x27;s abilities to work toward that purpose. A colleague is an associate in a profession or in a civil or ecclesiastical office. In a narrower sense, members of the faculty of a university or college are each other&#x27;s &quot;colleagues&quot;.

Sociologists of organizations use the word &#x27;collegiality&#x27; in a technical sense, to create a contrast with the concept of bureaucracy. Classical authors such as Max Weber consider collegiality as an organizational device used by autocrats to prevent experts and professionals from challenging monocratic and sometimes arbitrary powers. More recently, authors such as Eliot Freidson (USA), Malcolm Waters (Australia), and Emmanuel Lazega (France) have said that collegiality can now be understood as a full-fledged ideal-type of organization. According to these authors, industrial bureaucracy was created for mass production, using hierarchy, Tayorian subordination, and impersonal interactions for coordination. In contrast, collegiality, which historically precedes industrial bureaucracy (see partnerships already in Roman law) is used to innovate among peers, with coordination based on efforts to build consensus, collective responsibility, and personalized relationships for coordination (Lazega, 2020). This emphasis on personal relationships means that only social network analysis can identify the relational infrastructures that collegial settings rely upon for coordination and performance (for an empirical example, see Lazega, 2001; the network data, qualitative data, archival data, and scripts for the social network analysis, in this case, are available in several repositories such as https://data.sciencespo.fr/dataverse/Collegiality_Lawfirm_Network_Dataset or https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/). However, after two centuries of bureaucratization, at least in Western societies and economies, it isn&#x27;t easy to find truly collegial organizations. Collegiality can be found in collegial pockets within bureaucratic organizations (Lazega &amp; Wattebled, 2011), and the combination of both ideal-types (bureaucracy and collegiality) has been labeled &#x27;bottom-up collegiality&#x27;, &#x27;top-down collegiality&#x27;, and &#x27;inside-out collegiality&#x27;, leading to the identification in a society of oligarchies using collegiality as organizational ratchets for self-segregation in social stratification (Lazega, 2020). 

==In the Roman Republic==

In the Roman Republic, collegiality was the practice of having at least two people in each magistracy in order to divide power among several people and check their powers, both to prevent the rise of another king and to ensure more productive magistrates. Examples of Roman collegiality include the two consuls and censors, six &quot;praetors&quot;, eight &quot;quaestors&quot;, four &quot;aediles&quot;, ten tribunes and &quot;decemviri&quot;.

Exceptions include extraordinary magistrates, dictators and the &quot;magister equitum&quot;.

==In the Catholic Church==
In the Catholic Church, collegiality refers primarily to &quot;the Pope governing the Church in collaboration with the bishops of the local Churches, respecting their proper autonomy.&quot; This had been the practice of the early Church and was revitalized by the Second Vatican Council. One of the major changes during the Second Vatican Council was the council&#x27;s encouragement of bishops&#x27; conferences and the Pope&#x27;s establishment of the Synod of Bishops. From the beginning of his papacy, Pope Francis, who had twice been elected head of the Argentine Bishops&#x27; Conference, has advocated increasing the role of collegiality and synodality in the development of Church teachings.

<text>Éléonore-Louis Godefroi Cavaignac (30 May 18015 May 1845), better known as Godefroi Cavaignac, was a French politician and journalist.

He was born in Paris, the eldest son of Jean-Baptiste Cavaignac and the brother of Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, future head of state of France under the Second Republic; he was the uncle of Jacques Marie Eugène Godefroy Cavaignac.

Like his father, a Republican of the intransigent type, he was bitterly disappointed by the triumph of the monarchical principle after the Revolution of July 1830, in which he had taken part. He also participated in the Parisian uprisings of October 1830 during the trial of Charles X&#x27;s ministers, 1832 and 1834. On the third occasion, he was imprisoned, but escaped to England in 1835.
When he returned to France in 1841, he worked on the staff of &quot;La Réforme&quot;, and produced energetic republican propaganda. In 1843, he became president of the Society of the Rights of Man, of which he had been one of the founders in 1832.

The recumbent statue (1847) of Godefroi Cavaignac on his tomb at Montmartre, Paris, is one of the masterpieces of the sculptor François Rude and Rude&#x27;s pupil Ernest Christophe.

<doc id="326430" wikidata="Q1340572" url="?curid=326430" title="Finitely generated module">
<text>In mathematics, a finitely generated module is a module that has a finite generating set. A finitely generated module over a ring &quot;R&quot; may also be called a finite &quot;R&quot;-module, finite over &quot;R&quot;, or a module of finite type.

Related concepts include finitely cogenerated modules, finitely presented modules, finitely related modules and coherent modules all of which are defined below. Over a Noetherian ring the concepts of finitely generated, finitely presented and coherent modules coincide.

A finitely generated module over a field is simply a finite-dimensional vector space, and a finitely generated module over the integers is simply a finitely generated abelian group.

==Definition==

The left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated if there exist &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; in &quot;M&quot; such that for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, there exist &quot;r&quot;1, &quot;r&quot;2, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot; in &quot;R&quot; with &quot;x&quot; = &quot;r&quot;1&quot;a&quot;1 + &quot;r&quot;2&quot;a&quot;2 + ... + &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

The set {&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;} is referred to as a generating set of &quot;M&quot; in this case. A finite generating set need not be a basis, since it need not be linearly independent over &quot;R&quot;. What is true is: &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated if and only if there is a surjective &quot;R&quot;-linear map:
:formula_1
for some &quot;n&quot; (&quot;M&quot; is a quotient of a free module of finite rank).

If a set &quot;S&quot; generates a module that is finitely generated, then there is a finite generating set that is included in &quot;S&quot;, since only finitely many elements in &quot;S&quot; are needed to express the generators in any finite generating set, and these finitely many elements form a generating set. However, it may occur that &quot;S&quot; does not contain any finite generating set of minimal cardinality. For example the set of the prime numbers is a generating set of formula_2 viewed as formula_2-module, and a generating set formed from prime numbers has at least two elements, while the singleton is also a generating set.

In the case where the module &quot;M&quot; is a vector space over a field &quot;R&quot;, and the generating set is linearly independent, &quot;n&quot; is &quot;well-defined&quot; and is referred to as the dimension of &quot;M&quot; (&quot;well-defined&quot; means that any linearly independent generating set has &quot;n&quot; elements: this is the dimension theorem for vector spaces).

Any module is the union of the directed set of its finitely generated submodules.

A module &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated if and only if any increasing chain &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; of submodules with union &quot;M&quot; stabilizes: i.e., there is some &quot;i&quot; such that &quot;M&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;M&quot;. This fact with Zorn&#x27;s lemma implies that every nonzero finitely generated module admits maximal submodules. If any increasing chain of submodules stabilizes (i.e., any submodule is finitely generated), then the module &quot;M&quot; is called a Noetherian module.

== Examples ==
* If a module is generated by one element, it is called a cyclic module.
* Let &quot;R&quot; be an integral domain with &quot;K&quot; its field of fractions. Then every finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-submodule &quot;I&quot; of &quot;K&quot; is a fractional ideal: that is, there is some nonzero &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; such that &quot;rI&quot; is contained in &quot;R&quot;. Indeed, one can take &quot;r&quot; to be the product of the denominators of the generators of &quot;I&quot;. If &quot;R&quot; is Noetherian, then every fractional ideal arises in this way.
* Finitely generated modules over the ring of integers Z coincide with the finitely generated abelian groups. These are completely classified by the structure theorem, taking Z as the principal ideal domain.
* Finitely generated (say left) modules over a division ring are precisely finite dimensional vector spaces (over the division ring).

==Some facts==

Every homomorphic image of a finitely generated module is finitely generated. In general, submodules of finitely generated modules need not be finitely generated. As an example, consider the ring &quot;R&quot; = Z[&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ...] of all polynomials in countably many variables. &quot;R&quot; itself is a finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module (with {1} as generating set). Consider the submodule &quot;K&quot; consisting of all those polynomials with zero constant term. Since every polynomial contains only finitely many terms whose coefficients are non-zero, the &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;K&quot; is not finitely generated.

In general, a module is said to be Noetherian if every submodule is finitely generated. A finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is a Noetherian module (and indeed this property characterizes Noetherian rings): A module over a Noetherian ring is finitely generated if and only if it is a Noetherian module. This resembles, but is not exactly Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem, which states that the polynomial ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] over a Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot; is Noetherian. Both facts imply that a finitely generated commutative algebra over a Noetherian ring is again a Noetherian ring.

More generally, an algebra (e.g., ring) that is a finitely generated module is a finitely generated algebra. Conversely, if a finitely generated algebra is integral (over the coefficient ring), then it is finitely generated module. (See integral element for more.)

Let 0 → &quot;M&quot;′ → &quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot;′′ → 0 be an exact sequence of modules. Then &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated if &quot;M&quot;′, &quot;M&quot;′′ are finitely generated. There are some partial converses to this. If &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated and &quot;M&quot;′′ is finitely presented (which is stronger than finitely generated; see below), then &quot;M&quot;′ is finitely generated. Also, &quot;M&quot; is Noetherian (resp. Artinian) if and only if &quot;M&quot;′, &quot;M&quot;′′ are Noetherian (resp. Artinian).

Let &quot;B&quot; be a ring and &quot;A&quot; its subring such that &quot;B&quot; is a faithfully flat right &quot;A&quot;-module. Then a left &quot;A&quot;-module &quot;F&quot; is finitely generated (resp. finitely presented) if and only if the &quot;B&quot;-module is finitely generated (resp. finitely presented). The Forster–Swan theorem gives an upper bound for the minimal number of generators of a finitely generated module &quot;M&quot; a commutative Noetherian ring.

== Finitely generated modules over a commutative ring ==

For finitely generated modules over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, Nakayama&#x27;s lemma is fundamental. Sometimes, the lemma allows one to prove finite dimensional vector spaces phenomena for finitely generated modules. For example, if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot; is a surjective &quot;R&quot;-endomorphism of a finitely generated module &quot;M&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; is also injective, and hence is an automorphism of &quot;M&quot;. This says simply that &quot;M&quot; is a Hopfian module. Similarly, an Artinian module &quot;M&quot; is coHopfian: any injective endomorphism &quot;f&quot; is also a surjective endomorphism.

Any &quot;R&quot;-module is an inductive limit of finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-submodules. This is useful for weakening an assumption to the finite case (e.g., the characterization of flatness with the Tor functor).

An example of a link between finite generation and integral elements can be found in commutative algebras. To say that a commutative algebra &quot;A&quot; is a finitely generated ring over &quot;R&quot; means that there exists a set of elements of &quot;A&quot; such that the smallest subring of &quot;A&quot; containing &quot;G&quot; and &quot;R&quot; is &quot;A&quot; itself. Because the ring product may be used to combine elements, more than just &quot;R&quot;-linear combinations of elements of &quot;G&quot; are generated. For example, a polynomial ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] is finitely generated by as a ring, &quot;but not as a module&quot;. If &quot;A&quot; is a commutative algebra (with unity) over &quot;R&quot;, then the following two statements are equivalent:
* &quot;A&quot; is a finitely generated &quot;R&quot; module.
* &quot;A&quot; is both a finitely generated ring over &quot;R&quot; and an integral extension of &quot;R&quot;.

== Generic rank ==
Let &quot;M&quot; be a finitely generated module over an integral domain &quot;A&quot; with the field of fractions &quot;K&quot;. Then the dimension formula_4 is called the generic rank of &quot;M&quot; over &quot;A&quot;. This number is the same as the number of maximal &quot;A&quot;-linearly independent vectors in &quot;M&quot; or equivalently the rank of a maximal free submodule of &quot;M&quot; (&quot;cf. Rank of an abelian group&quot;). Since formula_5, formula_6 is a torsion module. When &quot;A&quot; is Noetherian, by generic freeness, there is an element &quot;f&quot; (depending on &quot;M&quot;) such that formula_7 is a free formula_8-module. Then the rank of this free module is the generic rank of &quot;M&quot;.

Now suppose the integral domain &quot;A&quot; is generated as algebra over a field &quot;k&quot; by finitely many homogeneous elements of degrees formula_9. Suppose &quot;M&quot; is graded as well and let formula_10 be the Poincaré series of &quot;M&quot;.
By the Hilbert–Serre theorem, there is a polynomial &quot;F&quot; such that formula_11. Then formula_12 is the generic rank of &quot;M&quot;.

A finitely generated module over a principal ideal domain is torsion-free if and only if it is free. This is a consequence of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, the basic form of which says a finitely generated module over a PID is a direct sum of a torsion module and a free module. But it can also be shown directly as follows: let &quot;M&quot; be a torsion-free finitely generated module over a PID &quot;A&quot; and &quot;F&quot; a maximal free submodule. Let &quot;f&quot; be in &quot;A&quot; such that formula_13. Then formula_14 is free since it is a submodule of a free module and &quot;A&quot; is a PID. But now formula_15 is an isomorphism since &quot;M&quot; is torsion-free.

By the same argument as above, a finitely generated module over a Dedekind domain &quot;A&quot; (or more generally a semi-hereditary ring) is torsion-free if and only if it is projective; consequently, a finitely generated module over &quot;A&quot; is a direct sum of a torsion module and a projective module. A finitely generated projective module over a Noetherian integral domain has constant rank and so the generic rank of a finitely generated module over &quot;A&quot; is the rank of its projective part.

==Equivalent definitions and finitely cogenerated modules==

The following conditions are equivalent to &quot;M&quot; being finitely generated (f.g.):
*For any family of submodules {&quot;Ni&quot; | &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;} in &quot;M&quot;, if formula_16, then formula_17 for some finite subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;I&quot;.
*For any chain of submodules {&quot;Ni&quot; | &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;} in &quot;M&quot;, if formula_18, then for some &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;.
*If formula_19 is an epimorphism, then the restriction formula_20 is an epimorphism for some finite subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;I&quot;.
From these conditions it is easy to see that being finitely generated is a property preserved by Morita equivalence. The conditions are also convenient to define a dual notion of a finitely cogenerated module &quot;M&quot;. The following conditions are equivalent to a module being finitely cogenerated (f.cog.):
*For any family of submodules {&quot;Ni&quot; | &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;} in &quot;M&quot;, if formula_21, then formula_22 for some finite subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;I&quot;.
*For any chain of submodules {&quot;Ni&quot; | &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;} in &quot;M&quot;, if formula_21, then &quot;Ni&quot; = for some &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;.
*If formula_24 is a monomorphism, where each formula_25 is an &quot;R&quot; module, then formula_26 is a monomorphism for some finite subset &quot;F&quot; of &quot;I&quot;.

Both f.g. modules and f.cog. modules have interesting relationships to Noetherian and Artinian modules, and the Jacobson radical &quot;J&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) and socle soc(&quot;M&quot;) of a module. The following facts illustrate the duality between the two conditions. For a module &quot;M&quot;:
* &quot;M&quot; is Noetherian if and only if every submodule &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot; is f.g.
* &quot;M&quot; is Artinian if and only if every quotient module &quot;M&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is f.cog.
* &quot;M&quot; is f.g. if and only if &quot;J&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is a superfluous submodule of &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;M&quot;/&quot;J&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is f.g.
* &quot;M&quot; is f.cog. if and only if soc(&quot;M&quot;) is an essential submodule of &quot;M&quot;, and soc(&quot;M&quot;) is f.g.
* If &quot;M&quot; is a semisimple module (such as soc(&quot;N&quot;) for any module &quot;N&quot;), it is f.g. if and only if f.cog.
* If &quot;M&quot; is f.g. and nonzero, then &quot;M&quot; has a maximal submodule and any quotient module &quot;M&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is f.g.
* If &quot;M&quot; is f.cog. and nonzero, then &quot;M&quot; has a minimal submodule, and any submodule &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot; is f.cog.
* If &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot;/&quot;N&quot; are f.g. then so is &quot;M&quot;. The same is true if &quot;f.g.&quot; is replaced with &quot;f.cog.&quot;

Finitely cogenerated modules must have finite uniform dimension. This is easily seen by applying the characterization using the finitely generated essential socle. Somewhat asymmetrically, finitely generated modules &quot;do not&quot; necessarily have finite uniform dimension. For example, an infinite direct product of nonzero rings is a finitely generated (cyclic!) module over itself, however it clearly contains an infinite direct sum of nonzero submodules. Finitely generated modules &quot;do not&quot; necessarily have finite co-uniform dimension either: any ring &quot;R&quot; with unity such that &quot;R&quot;/&quot;J&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is not a semisimple ring is a counterexample.

==Finitely presented, finitely related, and coherent modules==

Another formulation is this: a finitely generated module &quot;M&quot; is one for which there is an epimorphism mapping &quot;Rk&quot; onto &quot;M&quot; :

:f : &quot;Rk&quot; → &quot;M&quot;.

Suppose now there is an epimorphism,

:&quot;φ&quot; : &quot;F&quot; → &quot;M&quot;.

for a module &quot;M&quot; and free module &quot;F&quot;.

* If the kernel of &quot;φ&quot; is finitely generated, then &quot;M&quot; is called a finitely related module. Since &quot;M&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;F&quot;/ker(&quot;φ&quot;), this basically expresses that &quot;M&quot; is obtained by taking a free module and introducing finitely many relations within &quot;F&quot; (the generators of ker(&quot;φ&quot;)).
* If the kernel of &quot;φ&quot; is finitely generated and &quot;F&quot; has finite rank (i.e. ), then &quot;M&quot; is said to be a finitely presented module. Here, &quot;M&quot; is specified using finitely many generators (the images of the &quot;k&quot; generators of ) and finitely many relations (the generators of ker(&quot;φ&quot;)). See also: free presentation. Finitely presented modules can be characterized by an abstract property within the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules: they are precisely the compact objects in this category.
*A coherent module &quot;M&quot; is a finitely generated module whose finitely generated submodules are finitely presented.

Over any ring &quot;R&quot;, coherent modules are finitely presented, and finitely presented modules are both finitely generated and finitely related. For a Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot;, finitely generated, finitely presented, and coherent are equivalent conditions on a module.

Some crossover occurs for projective or flat modules. A finitely generated projective module is finitely presented, and a finitely related flat module is projective.

It is true also that the following conditions are equivalent for a ring &quot;R&quot;:
# &quot;R&quot; is a right coherent ring.
# The module &quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot; is a coherent module.
# Every finitely presented right &quot;R&quot; module is coherent.

Although coherence seems like a more cumbersome condition than finitely generated or finitely presented, it is nicer than them since the category of coherent modules is an abelian category, while, in general, neither finitely generated nor finitely presented modules form an abelian category.

<text>The College of Pontiffs (; see &quot;collegium&quot;) was a body of the ancient Roman state whose members were the highest-ranking priests of the state religion. The college consisted of the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; and the other &quot;pontifices&quot;, the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot;, the fifteen &quot;flamens&quot;, and the Vestals. The College of Pontiffs was one of the four major priestly colleges; originally their responsibility was limited to supervising both public and private sacrifices, but as time passed their responsibilities increased. The other colleges were the &quot;augures&quot; (who read omens), the &quot;quindecimviri sacris faciundis &quot; (&quot;fifteen men who carry out the rites&quot;), and the &quot;epulones&quot; (who set up feasts at festivals).

The title &quot;pontifex&quot; comes from the Latin for &quot;bridge builder&quot;, a possible allusion to a very early role in placating the gods and spirits associated with the Tiber River, for instance. Also, Varro cites this position as meaning &quot;able to do&quot;.

The &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was the most important member of the college. Until 104 BC, the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; held the sole power in appointing members to the other priesthoods in the college.

The &quot;flamens&quot; were priests in charge of fifteen official cults of Roman religion, each assigned to a particular god. The three major &quot;flamens&quot; (&quot;flamines maiores&quot;) were the &quot;flamen Dialis&quot;, the high priest of Jupiter; the &quot;flamen Martialis&quot;, who cultivated Mars; and the &quot;flamen Quirinalis&quot;, devoted to Quirinus. The deities cultivated by the twelve &quot;flamines minores&quot; were Carmenta, Ceres, Falacer, Flora, Furrina, Palatua, Pomona, Portunus, Volcanus (Vulcan), Volturnus, and two whose names are lost.

The Vestal Virgins were the only female members of the college. They were in charge of guarding Rome&#x27;s sacred hearth, keeping the flame burning inside the Temple of Vesta. Around age 6 to 10, girls were chosen for this position and were required to perform the rites and obligations for 30 years, including remaining chaste.

==Membership==

Membership in the various colleges of priests, including the College of Pontiffs, was usually an honor offered to members of politically powerful or wealthy families. Membership was for life, except for the Vestal Virgins whose term was 30 years. In the early Republic, only patricians could become priests. However, the &quot;Lex Ogulnia&quot; in 300 BC granted the right to become &quot;pontifices&quot; and &quot;augures&quot; to plebeians. Nevertheless, even in the late Republic it was still believed that the auspices ultimately resided with patrician magistrates, and certain ancient priesthoods: the &quot;Dialis&quot;, &quot;Martialis&quot; and &quot;Quirinalis flamines&quot;, and the college of the &quot;Salii&quot; were never opened to the plebeians.

The number of members in the College of Pontiffs grew over time. Originally consisting of three members, the number was increased to nine by the third century BC; Sulla increased the number to fifteen; Augustus increased the number even further, perhaps to as many as twenty-five.
Until the 3rd century BC, the College elected the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; from their own number. The right of the college to elect their own &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was returned, but the circumstances surrounding this are unclear. This changed again after Sulla, when in response to his reforms, the election of the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was once again placed in the hands of an assembly of seventeen of the twenty-five tribes. However, the College still controlled which candidates the assembly voted on. During the Empire, the office was publicly elected from the candidates of existing pontiffs, until the Emperors began to automatically assume the title, following Julius Caesar’s example. The &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; was a powerful political position to hold and the candidates for office were often very active political members of the College. Many, such as Julius Caesar, went on to hold consulships during their time as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;.

However, after 44 BC the pontiffs, as with the other official priests of Rome, lost their political influence. Martha Hoffman Lewis could only find four instances where the pontiff&#x27;s advice was asked: before Augustus&#x27; marriage to Livia; in 37 BC when they ordered the removal of the body of one of the proscribed from the Campus; they made expiatory sacrifices on the day the emperor Claudius married Agrippina; and their advice was sought concerning reforms of the discipline of the haruspices.

==Role in the Roman State==
During the Kingdom of Roman history, the pontiffs were primarily &quot;concilia&quot; (advisers) of the kings, but after the expulsion of the last Roman King in 510 BC, the College of Pontiffs became religious advisers to the Roman Senate. As the most important of the four priestly colleges, the College of Pontiffs’ duties involved advising the Senate on issues pertaining to the gods, the supervision of the calendar and thus the supervision of ceremonies with their specific rituals, and the appeasement of the gods upon the appearance of prodigies.

One of their most important duties was their guardianship of the &quot;libri pontificales&quot; (pontifical books). Among these were the &quot;acta&quot;, &quot;indigitamenta&quot; (lists of invocations or names of deities), &quot;ritualia&quot;, &quot;commentarii&quot;, &quot;fasti&quot;, and &quot;annales&quot; (yearly records of magistrates and important events). These items were under the sole possession of the College of Pontiffs and only they were allowed to consult these items when necessary.

The &quot;Lex Acilia de intercalando&quot; bestowed power on the College to manage the calendar. Thus, they determined the days which religious and political meetings could be held, when sacrifices could be offered, votes cast, and senatorial decisions brought forth.

The College of Pontiffs came to occupy the Regia (the old palace of the kings) during the early Republican period. They came to replace the religious authority that was once held by the king. A position, the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot;, was even created to replace the king for purposes of religious ceremonies.

When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, Pope Leo I began using the title &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; around 440 to emphasize the authority of the pope. The term &quot;chief priests&quot; in the New Testament (e.g. Mark 15:11) is translated as &quot;Pontifices&quot; in the Latin Vulgate and &quot;high priest&quot; as &quot;Pontifex&quot; in Hebrews 2:17.

==&quot;Pontifex minor&quot;==
The pontiffs were assisted by pontifical clerks or scribes &quot;(scribae)&quot;, a position known in the earlier Republican period as a &quot;scriba pontificius&quot; but by the Augustan period as a &quot;pontifex minor&quot;. A &quot;pontifex minor&quot; assisted at the rite &quot;(res divina)&quot; for Juno performed each Kalends, the first day of the month. He took up a position in the Curia Calabra, a sacred precinct &quot;(templum)&quot; on the Capitoline Hill, to observe the new moon.

<text>Variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts including musical performances, sketch comedy, magic, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. It is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. The variety format made its way from the Victorian era stage in Britain and America to radio and then television. Variety shows were a staple of English language television from the late 1940s into the 1980s.

While still widespread in some parts of the world, such as in the United Kingdom with the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;, and South Korea with &quot;Running Man&quot;, the proliferation of multichannel television and evolving viewer tastes have affected the popularity of variety shows in the United States. Despite this, their influence has still had a major effect on late night television whose late-night talk shows and NBC&#x27;s variety series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (which originally premiered in 1975) have remained popular fixtures of American television.

==History==

===Stage and radio===

The live entertainment style known as music hall in the United Kingdom and vaudeville in the United States can be considered a direct predecessor of the &quot;variety show&quot; format. Variety in the UK evolved in theatres and music halls, and later in working men&#x27;s clubs. British performers who honed their skills in music hall sketches include Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, George Formby, Gracie Fields, Dan Leno, Gertrude Lawrence, and Marie Lloyd. Most of the early top performers on British television and radio did an apprenticeship either in stage variety, or during World War II in Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). In the UK, the ultimate accolade for a variety artist for decades was to be asked to do the annual Royal Command Performance at the London Palladium theatre, in front of the monarch. Later known as the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; (from 1919), it continues today. In the 1940s, Stan Laurel revisited his music hall days when he performed at the &quot;Royal Variety&quot; show.

In the United States former vaudeville performers such as the Marx Brothers, George Burns and Gracie Allen, W. C. Fields, and Jack Benny honed their skills in the Borscht Belt before moving to talkies, to radio shows, and then to television shows, including variety shows. Radio variety shows were the predominant form of light entertainment during the Golden Age of Radio from the late 1920s through the 1940s; such radio shows typically included a house vocalist, music from the house band, a stand-up monologue and a short comedy sketch. Variety shows centered on running comedy sketches with recurring characters eventually evolved into sitcoms (situation comedies).

===1931–1960===
Variety shows were among the first programs to be featured on television during the experimental mechanical television era. Variety shows hosted by Helen Haynes and Harriet Lee are recorded in contemporary newspapers in 1931 and 1932; because of technical limits of the era, no recordings of either show have been preserved. After World War II, the genre again was an early favorite of the burgeoning electronic television industry; &quot;Hour Glass&quot;, dating to 1946, is the earliest surviving variety show, preserved in the form of audio recordings and still photographs. The genre proliferated during the Golden Age of Television, generally considered to be roughly 1948 to 1960. Many of these Golden Age variety shows were spin-offs or adaptations of previous radio variety shows.

From 1948 to 1971 &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was one of CBS&#x27;s most popular television series. Using his no-nonsense approach, host Ed Sullivan was instrumental in bringing many acts to prominence in the United States, including Elvis Presley and The Beatles. One year after Sullivan&#x27;s premiere, &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; first aired on television. Having carried over from an already 20-year run on radio, the series airs a program of religious music, messages, and occasional interviews, and remains the longest-running variety show in U.S. television history. &quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot; (1950–1960) was wildly popular and one of only 5 shows in the history of television to appear on all four major networks at the same time. The premise was a large dance party hosted by Kathryn Murray and Arthur Murray that showcased a new dance and a celebrity guest along with dozens of professional dancers. The show also hosted the only television appearance of Buddy Holly and The Crickets. &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; (1955–1982) would go on to become one of U.S. television&#x27;s longest-running variety shows; based on the concept of the big band remote from the old-time radio era, it was already one of the last shows of its kind when it debuted and far outlasted all other big-band centered broadcast series by the end of its run.

Other long-running American variety shows that premiered during this time include &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot; (1948–1956), Jerry Lester&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot;, &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; and &quot;Chesterfield Sound-Off Time&quot; (1949–1952); &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; (1950–1955), &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; (1950–1967, in various incarnations), &quot;The Morey Amsterdam Show&quot; (1950–1954 in various incarnations), &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; (1950–1955), &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; (1950–1954), &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; (1951–1971), &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot; (1951–1957), &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot; (1954–1960) and &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; (1956–1963). Perry Como also hosted a series of variety shows that collectively ran from 1948 to 1969, followed by variety specials that ran until 1994.

Shorter-lived variety shows during this period include &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; (1950–1952), &quot;The Jimmy Durante Show&quot; (1954–1956) and a different &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; (1957–1958).

In the UK &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;—which ran from 1953 to 1983—featured modern artists performing dressed in late Victorian/Early Edwardian costume, either doing their own act or performing as a music hall artist of that period. The audience was also encouraged to dress in period costume in a similar fashion. Other long-running British variety shows that originated in the 1950s include &quot;Tonight at the London Palladium&quot; (1955–1969), &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; (1958–1978), &quot;The White Heather Club&quot; (1958–1968) and &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; (an annual event televised since the 1950s).

===1960s===
Popular American variety shows that began in the 60s include a revival of &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; (1960–1970), &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; (1962–1971), &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot; (1963–1967), &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; (1964–1970), &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; (1965–1974), &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1967–1978), &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; (1967–1969) and &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; (1968–73). 1969 saw a flurry of new variety shows with rural appeal: &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; (1969–1971), &quot;The Jim Nabors Hour&quot; (1969–1971), &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot; (1969–1972) and &quot;Hee Haw&quot; (1969–1992).

Entertainers with less successful variety shows in the 1960s include Judy Garland and Sammy Davis Jr.

===1970s===

In 1970 and 1971, the American TV networks, CBS especially, conducted the so-called &quot;rural purge&quot;, in which shows that appealed to more rural and older audiences were canceled as part of a greater focus on appealing to wealthier demographics. Many variety shows, including long-running ones, were canceled as part of this &quot;purge,&quot; with a few shows (such as &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;) surviving and moving into first-run syndication. Variety shows continued to be produced in the 1970s, with most of them stripped down to only music and comedy.

Popular variety shows that ran in the 1970s include &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; (1970–1974), &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; (1971–1977, in various incarnations), &quot;The Bobby Goldsboro Show&quot; (1973–1975), &quot;The Hudson Brothers&#x27; Razzle Dazzle Show&quot; (1974–1975), &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; (1973–1981), &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot; (1973–1981), &quot;The Mac Davis Show&quot; (1974–1976), &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot; (1974–1976), &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975–present), &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; (1976–1979), &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1976–1981), and &quot;Sha Na Na&quot; (1977–1981). Of all of these, only &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; remains on the air today, and has become the second-longest-running variety show in the history of American television.

Entertainers with weekly variety shows that ran for one season or less in the 1970s include Captain &amp; Tennille, The Jacksons, The Keane Brothers, Bobby Darin, Mary Tyler Moore, Julie Andrews, Dolly Parton, Shields and Yarnell, The Manhattan Transfer, Starland Vocal Band, and the cast of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.

Entertainers with variety-based TV specials in the 70s include Carpenters, John Denver, Shirley MacLaine, Diana Ross, Bob Hope, and Pat Boone. Paul Lynde hosted a string of irregularly scheduled &quot;Comedy Hours&quot; through the late 1970s.

By the late 1970s nearly every TV variety show had ended production. Audiences were clearly tiring of the format; the highest-rated variety show of 1975, &quot;Cher&quot;, was only the 22nd-most watched show of the year.

===1980s–present===
By 1980 viewer interest in TV variety shows was rapidly waning. Most of the few new variety programs being produced were of remarkably poor quality (for instance, the infamous &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff&quot;), hastening the format&#x27;s demise, though a few moderately successful shows remained, such as &quot;Barbara Mandrell &amp; the Mandrell Sisters&quot; (November 1980 to June 1982). A brief revival of the genre arose in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Variety shows from this era included &quot;Dolly&quot; (starring Dolly Parton), which ran for 23 episodes on ABC during the 1987–88 season; &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; which aired on Fox from April 1987 through May 1990; a revival of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; from 1988 to 1989; a revival of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, which was broadcast by CBS for nine episodes in 1991 (following up on &quot;Carol &amp; Company&quot; on NBC the previous year); and Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Super Dave Osborne Show&quot; hosted by Bob Einstein from 1987 to 1991 (itself a spinoff of John Byner&#x27;s &quot;Bizarre&quot;, which ran from 1980 to 1986). By the 1990s, networks had given up on the format; after initially promising Phil Hartman his own variety show, NBC backed out of the agreement believing a variety show could no longer succeed.

By the 21st century the variety show format was practically extinct, due largely to changing tastes and the fracturing of media audiences (caused by the proliferation of cable and satellite television) that makes a multiple-genre variety show impractical. Even reruns of variety shows have generally not been especially widespread; TV Land briefly broadcast repeats of some variety shows (namely &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;) upon its launch in 1996, but within a few years, reruns of most of those shows (except &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;) were discontinued. Similarly, CMT held the rights to &quot;Hee Haw&quot; but broadcast very few episodes, opting mainly to hold the rights to allow them to create performance videos from the episodes to be shown in its video blocks. The current rights holder of &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, RFD-TV, has been more consistent broadcasting complete episodes of the program; RFD-TV also airs numerous other country-style variety shows from the 1960s and 1970s up through the present day, in a rarity for modern television. Another notable exception is &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, which has been frequently broadcast in reruns on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) since 1986. &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot; returned to television in 2017 with reruns on Jewish Life Television (and, in the case of a one-off Christmas special, the Christian-leaning network INSP); JLTV dropped Kaye from its schedule at the end of 2018. &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, which had aired in severely edited form sporadically in syndication since it ended in 1977, returned intact in 2019 on numerous platforms. Digital multicast network getTV shows variety shows on an irregular basis. The Spanish language variety show &quot;Sabado Gigante&quot;, which began in 1962, and then moved from Chile to the United States in 1986, continued to produce and broadcast new episodes on Univision until its cancellation in September 2015.

At least one national variety show continued on national radio into the 21st century. &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; was founded and created by Garrison Keillor in 1974 as an homage to rural radio variety shows, featuring sketch comedy based on radio dramas of the old-time radio era, complete with faux commercials. (For a brief time in the late 1980s, the show was replaced with &quot;The American Radio Company of the Air&quot;, also hosted and created by Keillor, was set in a more urban environment and likewise was based on old-time radio; its short run eventually morphed into a revival of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;). In 2016, following Keillor&#x27;s retirement, Chris Thile took over the program and, over the course of the next year, transformed it into &quot;Live from Here&quot;, a more streamlined musical variety series. &quot;Live from Here&quot;, which moved to New York City in 2019, was cancelled due to budget cuts in 2020.

Improvisational comic Wayne Brady, coming off his successful appearances on the panel game &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, launched an eponymous variety show in 2001, which aired on ABC. &quot;The Wayne Brady Show&quot; lasted only one summer season in its variety format; when the show returned the next year in syndication, it had been reformatted as a talk show, under which format it ran until 2004.

Fox&#x27;s &quot;Osbournes Reloaded&quot;, a variety show featuring the family of rocker Ozzy Osbourne, was canceled after only one episode had been telecast in 2009. More than two dozen affiliates refused to telecast the first episode of the show. This series had been slated for a six-episode run.

NBC has made repeated attempts at reviving the variety format since the late 2000s (the network&#x27;s last successful variety series, Michael Nesmith&#x27;s short-lived but influential &quot;Television Parts&quot;, was broadcast in the summer of 1985) . A pilot episode for &quot;Rosie Live&quot; was telecast the day before Thanksgiving Day in 2008 and, after receiving middling ratings and extremely poor reviews, was not picked up for its originally planned run in January 2009. In May 2014, NBC aired &quot;The Maya Rudolph Show&quot;, a variety show starring &quot;SNL&quot; performer Maya Rudolph. Like &quot;Rosie Live&quot;, the broadcast was intended to be a one-off special, but with the possibility of additional episodes depending on its performance. The special won its time slot, due mainly to a strong lead-in, and spawned the May 2016 premiere of &quot;Maya &amp; Marty&quot;, adding fellow &quot;SNL&quot; cast member Martin Short; under that format, &quot;Maya &amp; Marty&quot; lasted six episodes. Earlier that season, NBC aired &quot;Best Time Ever&quot;, an adaptation of the British variety game show &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; starring actor Neil Patrick Harris which was ultimately unsuccessful.

===Christmas and other variety specials===
Starting in the 1950s, some entertainers became associated with variety television specials that would recur on a regular basis, in some cases for decades, on American network TV. Such entertainers included Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Andy Williams and Mitzi Gaynor. Many of these were Christmas variety specials, which often showed the star in a set meant to look like their home, welcoming singers and other guests to perform duets of Christmas songs. The popularity of these Christmas shows outlasted that of weekly variety shows. In 1973, for example, even as variety shows were starting to fade in popularity, variety Christmas specials hosted by Williams and Como both attracted an enormous 40% of the American television audience. Williams&#x27;s and Johnny Cash&#x27;s annual Christmas specials outlasted the regularly scheduled variety shows that spawned them by several years. Also, Barbara Mandrell Christmas special. Christmas variety specials&#x27; popularity continued into the 1990s, before starting to wane in the 2000s. Nevertheless, the tradition has continued. Entertainers who have hosted Christmas variety specials in the 21st century include Kid Rock, Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson, Carrie Underwood, Lady Gaga, Michael Buble, Bill Murray, Gwen Stefani, and Darci Lynne.

===Talk shows===
Though the format faded in popularity in prime time, it thrived in American late-night TV. Night-time variety shows eventually evolved into late-night talk shows, which combine variety entertainment (primarily comedy and live music) with the aspects of a talk show (such as interviews with celebrities). The Emmy Awards academy considers the two genres to be related closely enough that, until 2015, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series was open to any of these types of show; in 2015, the academy separated late-night talk shows and sketch comedy series into separate categories.

During Johnny Carson&#x27;s tenure on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on NBC from 1962 to 1992, the show dominated late night ratings, and the other networks attempted late-night talk shows only sporadically. This changed with Carson&#x27;s retirement, and other networks began to air their own talk show competitors, starting with &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on CBS in 1993. As of the current generation of U.S. hosts, late-night talk shows vary widely on their resemblance to the original variety format, with Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s incarnation of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; putting heavy emphasis on sketch and game segments incorporating celebrity guests (especially involving music), while &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; has placed a larger emphasis on news satire similar to its host&#x27;s previous Comedy Central late-night program &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; (where Colbert portrayed himself as a parody of rightwing pundits).

&quot;The Richard Bey Show&quot; combined the variety show with the tabloid talk show, not only having its guests talk about their problems but also having them participate in absurdist games, and &quot;Sally Jesse Raphael&quot; was known for occasionally having music and fashion in the show, especially drag and gender-bending performances.

===Sketch comedy shows===
American sketch comedy series such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;In Living Color&quot;, &quot;Almost Live!&quot; (and its successor &quot;Up Late NW&quot;), &quot;MADtv&quot;, and &quot;SCTV&quot; also contain variety show elements, particularly musical performances and comedy sketches. The most obvious difference between shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and traditional variety shows is the lack of a single lead host (or hosts) and a large ensemble cast. &quot;SNL&quot; has used different guest hosts ever since its inception.

===Talent shows===
Televised talent shows have a variety show element, in that they feature a variety of different acts. Examples of US talent shows that feature entertainers from a broad variety of disciplines include &quot;Star Search&quot;, which had a run in the 1980s in syndication and a run on CBS in the early 2000s during the reality television boom; &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, which reached its peak in the 1970s but has had occasional revivals since then; and the worldwide &quot;Got Talent&quot; franchise.

===Telethons===
The variety show format also continued in America in the form of the telethon, which feature variety entertainment (often music) interspersed with appeals for viewers to make donations to support a charity or cause. The &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; was one of the best known telethons in the US, but it too was eventually canceled after several years of shortening (originally over 21 hours, by the time of its last telecast in 2014, by which point Lewis had been gone from the telethon several years, it was down to two hours). Another popular telethon, for United Cerebral Palsy, ended its run in 1998 shortly after the death of its founder and figurehead, Dennis James. Likewise only a handful of long-established local telethons remain.

==Other countries or regions==
===Australia===
The prime time variety show format was popular in the early decades of Australian television, spawning such series as &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;, &quot;The Graham Kennedy Show&quot;, &quot;The Don Lane Show&quot;, and &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, which ran for 27 years. Recent prime time variety shows include the short lived &quot;Micallef Tonight&quot; and &quot;The Sideshow&quot;.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil variety shows are referred to as a &quot;show de auditório&quot; (lit. &quot;auditorium show&quot;). Among the longest-running variety shows on Brazilian television have been SBT&#x27;s &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot; (1963–present), which was originally hosted by SBT&#x27;s owner and founder Silvio Santos (and is presently hosted by his daughter Patricia Abravanel), and TV Globo&#x27;s &quot;Domingão do Faustão&quot; (1989–2021), which was hosted by Fausto Silva until he departed the network to host a short-lived variety show on Rede Bandeirantes.

===Taiwan===
Two notable Taiwanese variety shows are &quot;Guess&quot; (1996–2012) and &quot;100% Entertainment&quot; (1997–present). East Asian variety programs are known for their constant use of sound effects, on-screen visuals and comedic bantering. Many of the shows are presented in a live-like presentation in a fast-paced setting, with scenes repeating or fast forwarded.

Another popular variety show in Taiwan was &quot;Kangsi Coming&quot; (2004–2016). It was famous for its bantering, which was scripted.

===Hong Kong===
The first Cantonese variety show to become a major success was Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;Enjoy Yourself Tonight&quot;, which first aired in 1967 and ran for 27 years. In Hong Kong, variety shows are often combined with elements of a cooking show or a talent competition but end in various results.

===Iran===

===Japan===

Variety programming has remained one of the dominant genres of television programming. While Japanese variety shows are famous abroad for their wild stunts, they vary from talk shows to music shows, from tabloid news shows to skit comedy. The prominent use of telop on screen has created a style that has influenced variety programming across Asia. One of the most popular variety shows in Japan includes &quot;Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai&quot;.

===Russia===
Soviet variety television established itself as a cornerstone of cultural life, with iconic shows that entertained millions and reflected societal values. &quot;Little Blue Light&quot; (&quot;Goluboy Ogonyok&quot;), which debuted in 1962, became a New Year&#x27;s Eve tradition, blending music, comedy sketches, and celebrity interviews in a convivial atmosphere that connected audiences with popular Soviet stars. Around the same time, &quot;Wider Circle&quot; (&quot;Shire Krug&quot;) expanded the format to emphasize cultural diversity, featuring folk performances, community events, and discussions of national achievements to promote unity. Adding satire to the mix, &quot;Pub &quot;13 Chairs&quot;&quot; (&quot;Kabachok &quot;13 Stulyev&quot;&quot;), aired from 1966 to 1980, and entertained viewers with its fictional Polish café setting, where characters performed comedic sketches and musical numbers inspired by Eastern Bloc satire magazines, offering subtle commentary on contemporary life. Meanwhile, &quot;Pesnya Goda&quot; (&quot;Song of the Year&quot;), launched in 1971, became an annual celebration of the year&#x27;s top songs and performers, evolving into a prestigious platform that mirrored shifts in Russian music and society.

===South Korea===

In South Korea, the hugely popular show &quot;Infinite Challenge&quot;, has been broadcast by MBC from 2005 to 2018, was a new model of this, called &quot;Real Variety Show&quot;. It combined comedy and variety scenes including unscripted stunts and special guest stars while taking place in various settings. Although many variety shows have existed in Korea long before the broadcast of &quot;Infinite Challenge&quot;, this program has given a rise to a new page in the history of Korean variety shows by introducing unscripted stunts. As a result, other broadcasting channels such as KBS and SBS have followed its path and introduced programs such as &quot;2 Days &amp; 1 Night&quot; and &quot;Running Man&quot;. These types of Korean variety shows are grabbing foreign interest of countries such as Japan, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and even the United States bringing on a new type of the Korean wave globally.

===Philippines===

Variety shows are a huge part of daily life in the Philippines, with all of the major networks running their own variety shows usually during lunchtime and can be on the air for between one and a half hours to three hours. The most notable Philippine variety show is the longest-running &quot;Eat Bulaga&quot;, which premiered in 1979 and has aired on RPN, ABS-CBN, GMA, and TV5 in the succeeding years. Recently many other TV networks are different formats of variety. ABS-CBN&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime&quot; has also shown great popularity and interest to Filipino viewers.

===Mexico===

In 1990, &quot;Súper&quot; was added to the title, and is how the show is currently known today.

Each episode of &quot;Dim Dam Dom&quot; was hosted in an all-white studio set by a different &quot;speakerine&quot; (a female continuity announcer), usually a popular actress or singer like Françoise Hardy, Marie Laforêt, Geraldine Chaplin, France Gall, Jane Birkin, Françoise Fabian, Romy Schneider.

<text>George Albert Francis (1928–3 or 4 April 2002), known professionally as George Francis, was a British boxing athletic trainer who trained world champion boxers such as Frank Bruno, John Conteh, John Mugabi, and Cornelius Boza-Edwards, and European champion Bunny Sterling, who also became the first West Caribbean boxer to claim a British title, fighting under Francis&#x27; tutelage.

==Biography==
George Francis was born in Camden Town, north London. He was only eight when his father died, and left school at the age of 11 to support his family. In the 1930s, he was a bare-knuckle fighter. After a local policemen persuaded him to give that up he turned to amateur boxing. Francis worked his way up the ranks at Covent Garden Market and eventually became a porter. He was a member of a local boxing club and it was there that he decided to switch from boxer to trainer. These early ventures into the fight game were to be the start of a career which saw him become involved with some of the greatest boxers in the world.

Francis was known for making his boxers run on Hampstead Heath and swim in the cold water of Highgate Men&#x27;s Pond as part of their training.

After Paul McCartney visited Francis&#x27;s gym to watch Conteh train, McCartney employed Francis&#x27;s son Michael as a bodyguard.

==Death==
Francis was found hanged at his home in Hillway, Highgate, apparently having died by suicide on 3 or 4 April 2002. He was 73. His death followed a period of severe depression that occurred after the deaths of both his wife, Joan, and his son, Simon.

<text>The Lummi Nation ( ; Lummi: &#x27; or &quot;;&quot; officially known as theLummi Tribe of the Lummi Reservation) is a federally-recognized tribe of primarily Lummi people. The Lummi Nation also includes some Nooksack, Samish, and other local tribes which were removed to the reservation. It is based in the coastal area of the Pacific Northwest region of Washington state in the United States, and is located within the Bellingham Metropolitan Area

==History==

=== Aboriginal Lummi ===

The Lummi originally inhabited many settlements on the San Juan Islands. However, due to high amounts of raiding from northern peoples and disease, they migrated to the mainland, settling around the lower Nooksack River. They displaced or assimilated the people living there at the time, the Skalakhan and Hulwhaluq. The villages that they occupied on the mainland were fortified with large stockades, which they used to defend themselves from the northern raiders.

=== Treaty of Point Elliott ===

In 1855, the predecessor tribes of the Lummi Nation (including the Lummi people) were signatory to the Treaty of Point Elliott, which was signed at modern-day Muckilteo. Chowitsoot, one of the Lummi leaders at the time, signed the treaty for the Lummi &quot;and other tribes.&quot; 13 additional people signed the treaty for the Lummi. The treaty demanded that the Lummi cede the title to their lands, and in return, the 12,562.94 acre Lummi Reservation was established near the mouth of the Nooksack River, on the Lummi Peninsula.

On November 22, 1873, the Lummi Reservation was enlarged to 13,600 ares.

=== 20th century ===
In 1897, the case &quot;United States v. Alaska Packers&#x27; Association&quot; disallowed the Lummi on the reservation from removing non-Native fishermen in their fisheries. Following this, much of the recent history of the Lummi Nation has been marked by a struggle to regain their fishing rights. Following steady increases in the number of individuals and firms fishing in areas traditionally fished by the Lummi, the nation fought for and gained limited protection under the law for the right to fish in their traditional manner. The Lummi Nation was part of the broader fight for fishing and treaty rights, which came to a head in 1974 with &quot;United States v. Washington&quot; (commonly known as the Boldt Decision).

In 1970, the Lummi Nation adopted a new constitution which gave the Business Council broader powers.

=== 21st century ===
Since the late 20th century, the Lummi Nation has worked to revive elements of its traditional culture. From July 30 to August 4, 2007, the Lummi Nation hosted its first potlatch since the 1930s as part of the Tribal Canoe Journeys Paddle to Lummi. During the event, 68 families paddled hand-made canoes to the Lummi Reservation from parts of Washington and British Columbia.

In 2017, the Lummi Nation declared a state of emergency in the aftermath of the 2017 Cypress Island Atlantic salmon pen break. They recaptured most of the recovered non-native, farmed Atlantic salmon. The Lummi and other parties interested in the fisheries of the Northwest were very worried about Atlantic salmon interfering with those of the Pacific waters and rivers.

In 2024, a nonprofit led by a Lummi Nation elder acquired over 2 acres of land just north of Madrona Point on Orcas Island. The organization intends to restore the land to the Lummi Nation. The newly acquired land, situated next to Madrona Point, adds to the Lummi Nation&#x27;s existing holdings of over 24 acres. Madrona Point is a sacred area held in trust by the United States. It, along with the recent acquisition, is part of the ancestral village of Ts’elxwisen’, which historically covered what is now Eastsound.

==== Gateway Pacific Terminal ====
The Gateway Pacific Terminal was a proposed coal export terminal at Xwe’chi’eXen (Cherry Point) in Whatcom County, along the Salish Sea shoreline. The Lummi opposed the project because of potential adverse environmental impact on their treaty fishing rights and their sacred sites. It did not win approval.

== Lummi Reservation ==

The Lummi Reservation is the Indian reservation of the Lummi Nation. Established in 1855, it was intended to serve as the reservation for the Lummi, Nooksack, and Samish peoples, as well as several other local peoples. Originally, the reservation was 12,562.94 acres, however it was enlarged to 13,600 acres in 1877.

An estimated 6,590 people live on the Lummi Reservation. Roughly 2,564 are enrolled Lummi citizens, and 665 are either related to or live with an enrolled tribal member. Some 3,361 are neither tribal members nor affiliated with any member of the Lummi Nation. The 2000 United States Census recorded 4,193 persons residing on the reservation, of whom 1,828 (43.6 percent) identified as White, and 2,114 (50.4 percent) identified as being of only Native American ancestry.

There are approximately 1,864 homes located on the reservation. Approximately 697 of these have an enrolled Lummi living in the home; thus, roughly 1,167 homes on the reservation do not house a tribal member.

== Demographics ==
As of April 2010 there are 4,483 enrolled tribal members. 49.6% are female and 50.4% are male. The median age of tribal members is 29. Nearly one-third of the members, some 31.8%, are 18 years or younger. 11.6% are 55 or older. According to studies conducted by the Lummi Nation either on or near the reservation boundaries, enrolled Lummi tribal members have an average household size of approximately 4.5 people.

==Economy==

=== Fishing and aquaculture ===
The Lummi Nation owns a large oyster farm, which is the third largest on the west coast of the United States. They also have large aquaculture facilities on their reservation.

In 1970, the Lummi Business Council created the Aquacultural Project to harvest food from their waters. By the 1980s, they operated the largest salmon fleet on Puget Sound, with approximately 600 gillnet boats and 40 seiners.

Throughout the 1990s, salmon runs were highly diminished, and in 2001, the fishing season was a &quot;complete failure.&quot; Later that year, the Lummi Business Council declared the Lummi Nation an &quot;Economic Fisheries Disaster Area&quot; and created programs to try to retrain idle fishermen. By 2003, their fishing industry had collapsed, and the Lummi fleet was reduced to between 150 and 200 gillnet boats and 3 or 4 seiners.

=== Tribal gambling ===
They were among the first tribes to open an Indian casino in Washington after the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. The tribe opened the Lummi Casino in 1992 and was the second largest employer in Whatcom County, with 450 employees. However, it closed in 1997 after traffic from Canada had declined.

A new casino, the Silver Reef Casino Resort, opened in 2002, close to Interstate 5. It was the target of an $11-million expansion in 2003, which built a steakhouse, terrace, cocktail bar, and a 400-seat pavilion for events.

=== Employment ===
A recent collaborative study conducted by the Lummi Nation and Northern Economics Inc. found the following about the Lummi Nation workforce. 28% of the adult population (ages 18–64) is employed. The labor workforce participation rate is 25%. The Lummi unemployment rate of about 75% is estimated to be three times the local average. The median monthly income for employed Lummi tribal members is approximately $1,200.

== Government and politics ==
The constitution of the Lummi Nation was adopted in 1970. The tribe is governed by the Lummi Indian Business Council, an elected eleven-member council, on which members serve a three-year term. The council selects executive officers for their duties, including chair, vice-chair, treasurer, and secretary, and establishes committees for administration of the tribe. The current Business Council is as follows:

* Chairman: Anthony Hillaire
* Vice Chairman: Terrance Adams
* Treasurer: Gerald James
* Secretary: Lisa Wilson
* Council Member: Maureen Kinley
* Council Member: Rosalee Revey-Jacobs
* Council Member: Vendean (Jim) Washington
* Council Member: Karlie Kinley
* Council Member: Cliff Cultee
* Council Member: Nickolaus Lewis
* Council Member: Henry Cagey

==Culture==
For the past century, the Lummi Nation has been attempting to preserve and revitalize their traditional culture. The first Lummi potlatch since 1937 was hosted in 2007.

For the Lummi nation, canoes are a large part of their culture. Each year in June, the Lummi Nation hosts the Lummi Stommish Water Carnival, which features large canoe race, as well as having dancing and traditional gambling games. Tribes from Washington and British Columbia compete in war canoes measuring up to fifty feet. The event was established by Lummi veterans of World War I, who wished to honor tribal citizens in World War II. Today, the carnival is put on in honor of Lummi veterans of all wars.

=== Languages ===
The Lummi language (&quot;Xwlemi Chosen,&quot; ) is a dialect of the North Straits Salish language, part of the larger Salishan language family.

== Infrastructure ==
The Lummi Nation operates the Portage Bay Construction company, which builds homes in the Ferndale and Bellingham Areas, and they have been operating a home-improvement program since 1969.

=== Healthcare ===
The Lummi Nation operates a healthcare facility in Bellingham where they offer both medical and dental care, as well as substance abuse counseling.

==Education==
The Lummi Nation has been working to increase the education levels among their youth. Among enrolled Lummis aged 25–64: 15.1% do not have a high school diploma or a GED; 33.8% have either a high school or GED degree; 27.1% have some college experience; 14.9% have a two-year (AA or AS) degree; 7.5% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree; and 1.6% have a graduate or professional degree.

The tribe operates several schools and education programmes. They have Head Start and daycare centers for children. While most education for Lummi children is provided by the Ferndale School District, the Lummi Nation also operates the Lummi Nation School (LNS), a K-12 school that opened in 2004. Four years later, they added the Lummi Youth Academy, a boarding school available for grades 9 through 12. The academy is focused on strengthening Lummi culture, and offers social programs to at-risk teenagers.

The tribe founded the Lummi Indian School of Aquaculture in 1973 as a means of training tribal members in fishing and shellfish hatcheries. Later, the school was refounded into Northwest Indian College, the only accredited tribal college in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.

<doc id="326439" wikidata="Q192015" url="?curid=326439" title="Yu-Gi-Oh!">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kazuki Takahashi. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; between September 1996 and March 2004, with its chapters collected in 38 volumes. The series follows Yugi Mutou, a teenager who solves the ancient Millennium Puzzle. Yugi becomes host to a gambling alter-ego or spirit who solves his conflicts with various games. As the manga progresses, the focus largely shifts to the card game &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; (originally known as &quot;Magic &amp; Wizards&quot;), where opposing players &quot;duel&quot; one another in mock battles of fantasy monsters.

The manga series has spawned a media franchise that includes multiple spin-off manga, anime series, video games, and a real-world card game, the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game, based on the fictional &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; game. The first anime series adaptation, simply titled &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; and produced by Toei Animation, aired from April to October 1998, while the second one, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters&quot;, produced by NAS and animated by Gallop, aired from April 2000 to September 2004.

&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

==Plot==

&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; follows Yugi Mutou, a timid young boy who is frequently bullied. Yugi loves to play games and, at the beginning of the series, is solving the , an Ancient Egyptian artifact, hoping that it will grant him his wish of making friends. Yugi eventually completes the Puzzle, causing his body to play host to a mysterious spirit with the personality of a gambler. From that moment onwards, whenever Yugi or any of his friends is threatened, the spirit, briefly possessing Yugi, challenges the antagonist to that reveal that person&#x27;s true nature, with the loser often being subjected to an adverse . Yugi and his friends gradually become aware of the spirit&#x27;s existence, referring to him as the &quot;other Yugi&quot;.

As the series progresses, Yugi and his friends learn that the spirit is actually that of a nameless Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, who had lost his memories after being sealed inside the Puzzle. As Yugi and his companions attempt to help the Pharaoh regain his memories, they find themselves going through many trials as they wager their lives facing off against those who wield the other and the dark power of the Shadow Games.

==Development==
In the initial planning stages of the manga, Takahashi had wanted to draw a horror manga. Although the end result was a manga about games, some horror elements influenced certain aspects of the story. Takahashi decided to use &quot;battle&quot; as his primary theme. Since there had been so much &quot;fighting&quot; manga, he found it difficult to come up with something original. He decided to create a fighting manga where the main character does not hit anybody, but also struggled with that limitation. When the word &quot;game&quot; came to mind, he found it much easier to work with.

When an interviewer asked Takahashi if he tried to introduce younger readers to real life gaming culture referenced in the series, Takahashi explained that he simply included &quot;stuff he played and enjoyed&quot;, and that it may have introduced readers to role-playing games and other games. He added that he created some of the games seen in the series, stressing the importance of &quot;communication between people&quot; that is often present in tabletop role-playing games but absent in solitary video games and especially over the Internet, where quality communication is near impossible.

Takahashi had always been interested in games, claiming to have been obsessed as a child and remained interested in them as an adult. In a game, he considered the player to become a hero. He decided to base the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; series around such games and used this idea as the premise; Yugi was a weak childish boy, who became a hero when he played games. With friendship being one of the major themes of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, he based the names of the two major characters &quot;Yūgi&quot; and &quot;Jōnouchi&quot; on the Japanese word &quot;yūjō&quot;, which means &quot;friendship&quot;. Henshin, the ability to turn into something or someone else, is something Takahashi believed all children dreamed of. He considered Yugi&#x27;s &quot;henshin&quot; Dark Yugi, a savvy, invincible games player, to be a big appeal to children.

Takahashi said that the card game held the strongest influence in the manga, because it &quot;happened to evoke the most response&quot; from readers. Prior to that point, Takahashi did not plan to make the story about cards.

Takahashi said that the &quot;positive message&quot; for readers of the series is that each person has a &quot;strong hidden part&quot; (like &quot;human potential&quot;) within himself or herself, and when one finds hardship, the &quot;hidden part&quot; can emerge if one believes in him/herself and in his/her friends. Takahashi added that this is &quot;a pretty consistent theme.&quot;

The editor of the English version, Jason Thompson, said that the licensing of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; manga had not been entirely coordinated, so Viz decided to use many of the original character names and to &quot;keep it more or less violent and gory&quot;. Thompson said that the manga &quot;was almost unchanged from the Japanese original&quot;. Because the core fanbase of the series was, according to Thompson, &quot;8-year-old boys (and a few incredible fangirls)&quot;, and because the series had little interest from &quot;hardcore, Japanese-speaking fans, the kind who run scanlation sites and post on messageboards&quot; as the series was perceived to be &quot;too mainstream&quot;, the Viz editors allowed Thompson &quot;a surprising amount of leeway with the translation&quot;. In a 2004 interview, the editors of the United States &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; mentioned that Americans were surprised when reading the stories in the first seven volumes, as they had not appeared on television as a part of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters&quot; anime. Takahashi added &quot;The story is quite violent, isn&#x27;t it? &quot;[laughs]&quot;&quot;

The English language release by 4Kids has been subject to censorship to make it more appropriate for children; for example, mentions of death or violence were replaced by references to &quot;being sent to the Shadow Realm&quot;.

The Japanese title, , stylized as , translates into English as &quot;Game King&quot;. is also the name of the protagonist, while &quot;Yūgiō&quot; is also the title the second personality inhabiting his body holds as an invincible game master. Additionally, the character names &quot;Yūgi&quot; and &quot;Jōnouchi&quot; are based on the word . &quot;Yūjō&quot; is pointed out by Jōnouchi to Yūgi at the end of the first manga chapter, as &quot;something visible yet invisible&quot; (what&#x27;s visible is the two of them, what&#x27;s invisible is their friendship), as a way to tell Yūgi that he wants to be his friend. The pun was represented with a &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game card titled .

===Trading card game===
The &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game is a Japanese collectible card battle game developed and published by Konami. Based on the Duel Monsters concept from the original manga series, the game sees players using a combination of monsters, spells, and traps to defeat their opponent. First launched in Japan in 1999, the game has received various changes over the years, such as the inclusion of new monster types to coincide with the release of new anime series. In 2011, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; called it the top-selling trading card game in history, with billion cards sold worldwide. , the game is estimated to have sold about cards worldwide.

===Video games===

There are several video games based on the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise which are published by Konami, the majority of which are based on the trading card game, and some based on other games that appeared in the manga. Aside from various games released for consoles and handheld systems, arcade machines known as Duel Terminals have been released which are compatible with certain cards in the trading card game. Outside of Konami&#x27;s titles, Yugi appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting games &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot;, &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;, and &quot;Jump Force&quot;.

==Reception==
The manga has sold million copies. In December 2002, Shonen Jump received the ICv2 Award for &quot;Comic Product of the Year&quot; due to its unprecedented sales numbers and its successfully connecting comics to both the television medium and the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; collectible card game; one of the top CCG games of the year. In August 2008, TV Tokyo reported that over billion Yu-Gi-Oh! cards had been sold worldwide. By 2011, it had sold billion cards worldwide.

John Jakala of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; reviewed the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; manga in 2003 as part of reviewing the U.S. &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;. Jakala said that while the commercials for the second series anime made the anime appear &quot;completely uninteresting,&quot; the comic &quot;is unexpectedly dark and moody.&quot; Jakala added that at one moment the series &quot;reminded me of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s work: Yugi finds himself drawn into a magical world of ancient forces where there are definite rules that must be obeyed.&quot; Jakala concluded that the fact the series uses games as plot devices &quot;opens up a lot of story possibilities&quot; and that he feared that the series had the potential to &quot;simply devolve into a tie-in for the popular card game.&quot;

Jason Thompson, the editor of the English version of the manga, ranked &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; as number three of his five personal favorite series to edit, stating that he thinks &quot;the story is actually pretty solid for a shonen manga&quot; and that &quot;you can tell it was written by an older man because of the obsession with death, and what might come after death, which dominates the final story arc,&quot; enjoying all the RPG and card gaming terminology found within the series.

Lisa Takeuchi Cullen argued that the manga series started to garner more popularity among Japanese children with the second series because of its somewhat &quot;dark story lines, leggy girls and terrifying monsters&quot;. Cullen speculated that the series was not popular among Japanese parents, due to it being more intended for teenagers rather than the young kids that make up the audience for franchises such as &quot;Pokémon&quot;.

&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; was used by Bandai as part of their &quot;Candy Toy&quot; toyline.

==Cultural impact==
A fandub parody video of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; was uploaded on YouTube on July 15, 2006, by Martin Billany (also known as LittleKuriboh) titled &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series – Episode One Redux&quot;. After becoming popular, it started trend among anime communities to produce abridged series for different works.

In 2024 US Olympic track and field trials, Noah Lyles showed off &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; cards Blue Eyes White Dragon and Exodia to the camera before running.

<doc id="326441" wikidata="Q6767600" url="?curid=326441" title="Mark Fidrych">
<text>Mark Steven Fidrych ( ; August 14, 1954 – April 13, 2009), nicknamed &quot;the Bird&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher who played five seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Detroit Tigers.

Known for his quirky antics on the mound, Fidrych led the major leagues with a 2.34 ERA in 1976, won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year award, and finished with a 19–9 record. Shortly thereafter, however, injuries derailed his career, which ended after just five seasons in the major leagues.

==Early life==
The son of an assistant school principal, Fidrych played baseball at Algonquin Regional High School in Northborough, Massachusetts, and at Worcester Academy, a day and boarding school in central Massachusetts. In the 1974 amateur draft he was selected in the 10th round by the Detroit Tigers. He later joked that when he received a phone call informing him that he had been drafted, he thought he was drafted into the armed services, not thinking there were any Major League teams considering him. In the minor leagues one of his coaches with the Lakeland Tigers dubbed the lanky 6-foot-3 right-handed pitcher &quot;The Bird&quot; because of his resemblance to the &quot;Big Bird&quot; character on the popular &quot;Sesame Street&quot; television program.

==1976 season==
Fidrych joined the Tigers spring training camp in 1976 and made the roster, though he did not make his Major League debut until April 20, pitching only one inning through mid-May.

In his third appearance, on May 15, Fidrych made his first major league start, caught by Bruce Kimm, his batterymate in 1975 at Triple A Evansville. He held the Cleveland Indians hitless through six innings and ended up with a two-hit, 2–1 complete game victory, with one walk and five strikeouts. In addition to his pitching, Fidrych attracted attention in his debut for talking to the ball while on the pitcher&#x27;s mound, strutting in a circle around the mound after every out, patting down the mound, and refusing to allow groundskeepers to fix the mound in the sixth inning. After the game, sports writer Jim Hawkins wrote in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;: &quot;He really is something to behold.&quot; Rico Carty of the Indians said he thought Fidrych &quot;was trying to hypnotize them.&quot;

On May 25 at Fenway Park in Boston, Fidrych started his second game in front of two busloads of fans who traveled from Fidrych&#x27;s hometown of Northborough. Fidrych pitched well, allowing two earned runs (a two-run home run by Carl Yastrzemski) in eight innings, but Luis Tiant shut out the Tigers, and Fidrych received his first major league loss.

On May 31, Fidrych pitched an 11-inning, complete-game victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. On June 5, he pitched another 11-inning, complete-game victory over the Texas Rangers in Arlington. Fidrych continued to pitch well heading into the All-Star break:

* June 11: Fidrych pitched a complete game 4–3 victory over the California Angels before a crowd of 36,377 on a Friday night at Tiger Stadium.
* June 19: Fidrych pitched a complete game 4–3 victory over the Kansas City Royals before a crowd of 21,659 on a Wednesday night at Tiger Stadium.
* June 24: Fidrych returned to Fenway Park with his family and friends in the stands. He gave up back-to-back home runs to Fred Lynn and Yastrzemski but won his sixth consecutive start.
* June 28: Fidrych pitched before 47,855 at Tiger Stadium and a national television audience in the millions, as the Tigers hosted the New York Yankees on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; with Bob Prince, Warner Wolf, and Bob Uecker in the broadcast booth. Fidrych earned a 5–1 complete-game victory which took only an hour and 51 minutes. Fans would not leave the stadium until The Bird emerged from the dugout for a curtain call. After the broadcast, which was filled with plenty of &quot;Bird&quot; antics, Fidrych became a national celebrity.
* July 3: Fidrych pitched before a sell-out crowd of 51,650 on a Saturday night at Tiger Stadium. He shut out the Baltimore Orioles, 4–0, improved to 9–1 in ten starts, and reduced his earned run average (ERA) to 1.85.
* July 9: Pitching in front of a sell-out crowd of 51,041 at Tiger Stadium, Fidrych held the Royals to one run in nine innings, but Dennis Leonard shut out the Tigers 1–0. Despite the loss, Detroit fans refused to leave the stadium until The Bird made a curtain call.

Fidrych was named to the 1976 AL All-Star team; the game was played on July 13 at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. He was named the starter, at the time becoming just the second rookie to start an All-Star game following Dave Stenhouse in 1962. Fidrych gave up two earned runs in the first inning, none in the second, and took the loss.

Just three days later, on July 16, Fidrych won his tenth game, a 1–0 victory over the A&#x27;s. Four days later in Minnesota, before Fidrych&#x27;s thirteenth start, the Twins released thirteen homing pigeons on the mound before the game. According to Fidrych, &quot;they tried to do that to blow my concentration.&quot; Fidrych pitched another complete game, an 8–3 win, and improved his record to 11–2. On Saturday, July 24, Fidrych surrendered four earned runs on nine hits and lasted only 4 innings; John Hiller got the win for the Tigers in long relief on the &quot;Game of the Week&quot;.

After the game, Fidrych was interviewed on live television, and a small controversy arose when Fidrych said &quot;bullshit&quot; on the air. Fidrych recalled: &quot;He (NBC commentator Tony Kubek) said, it looked like you were gonna cry. I just said, No, I wasn&#x27;t about to cry. I was just bullshit... And then I said, excuse me. I said, I didn&#x27;t mean to swear on the air but I just showed you my feelings.&quot; The next day, Fidrych received a telegram informing him he had been fined $250 by baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn; however, it was a prank sent by his own teammates.

On July 29 and August 7, Fidrych threw consecutive six-hit complete games. He won one of the games and lost the other. The Tigers edged the Rangers, 4–3, on August 11 as Fidrych notched his 13th win over Gaylord Perry. Six days later, the Tigers drew a season-high 51,822 fans as Fidrych went to 14–4, beating opposing pitcher Frank Tanana 3–2. On August 25, the Tigers downed the White Sox, 3–1, in front of 40,000 fans on a Wednesday night in Detroit. Fidrych held the White Sox to five hits in a game which lasted only 108 minutes. Between August 29 and September 17, Fidrych lost three consecutive decisions, bringing his record to 16–9.

Fidrych beat the Indians two starts in a row, on September 21 and 28. In his last start of the 1976 season, Fidrych picked up his 19th win, defeating the Brewers, 4–1, giving up five hits. A month later, Fidrych was announced as the runner-up for the Cy Young Award, with Jim Palmer taking the award.

Fidrych won the AL Rookie of the Year Award and was named Tiger of the Year by the Detroit baseball writers. He led all of MLB in ERA (2.34) and Adjusted ERA+ (158), while leading the AL in complete games (24). He finished in the top five in several other statistical categories, including wins, win percentage, shutouts, walks plus hits per innings pitched (WHIP), and bases on balls per nine innings pitched. He received the 11th-highest vote total in the year&#x27;s AL MVP voting.

In Fidrych&#x27;s 18 home starts in 1976, he compiled a 12–6 record while the Tigers averaged 33,649 fans; the team drew an average of only 13,843 in his non-starts.

During the offseason between the 1976 and 1977 seasons, Fidrych published an autobiography with Tom Clark titled &quot;No Big Deal.&quot;

==Injury and retirement==
Fidrych tore the cartilage in his knee fooling around in the outfield during spring training in 1977. He picked up where he left off after his return from the injury, but about six weeks after his return, during a July 4 game against Baltimore, he felt his arm just, in his words, &quot;go dead.&quot; It was a torn rotator cuff, but it would not be diagnosed until 1985. At the time Fidrych injured his arm in Baltimore his record was 6-2 before the game. He was removed from the game after 5.2 innings right after Eddie Murray hit a two-run home run. The Baltimore Orioles scored six runs in the inning and won the game 6-4. Fidrych finished the season 6–4 with a 2.89 ERA and was again invited to the All-Star Game, but he declined the invitation due to injury. Still on the disabled list toward the end of the season, Fidrych worked as a guest color analyst on a &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; telecast for ABC; he was subsequently criticized for his lack of preparation, as when play-by-play partner Al Michaels tried talking with him about Philadelphia Phillies player Richie Hebner and Fidrych responded, &quot;Who&#x27;s Richie Hebner?&quot; As an AL player, Fidrych had never had to face Hebner, who played in the National League.

He pitched only three games in 1978, winning two, including an opening day win. On August 12, 1980, 48,361 fans showed up at Tiger Stadium to see what turned out to be his last attempt at a comeback. Fidrych pitched his last MLB game on October 1, 1980, in Toronto, going five innings and giving up four earned runs, while picking up the win in an 11–7 Tigers victory which was televised in Detroit.

At the end of the 1981 season, Detroit gave Fidrych his outright release and he signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox, playing for one of their minor league teams. However, his torn rotator cuff, still not diagnosed and left untreated, never healed. At age 29, he was forced to retire. Fidrych went to famed sports medicine doctor James Andrews in 1985. Dr. Andrews discovered the torn rotator cuff and operated; still, the damage already done to the shoulder effectively ended Fidrych&#x27;s chance of coming back to a professional baseball career.

Fidrych remained cheerful and upbeat. In a 1998 interview, when asked who he would invite to dinner if he could invite anyone in the world, Fidrych said, &quot;My buddy and former Tigers teammate Mickey Stanley, because he&#x27;s never been to my house.&quot;

Fidrych lived with his wife Ann, whom he married in 1986, on a farm in Northborough. They had a daughter, Jessica. Aside from fixing up his farmhouse, he worked as a contractor hauling gravel and asphalt in a ten-wheeler. On weekends, he helped out in his mother-in-law&#x27;s business, Chet&#x27;s Diner, on Route 20 in Northborough; the diner was later operated by his daughter. He would also frequent the local baseball field to help teach and play ball with the kids.

==Pitching style==
Fidrych was not an overpowering pitcher, posting strikeout rates below the league average throughout his career. He was, however, praised for having exceptional control (compiling a walk rate of 1.77 per 9 IP over his first two seasons), and for having good late movement on his pitches while keeping the ball down and inducing many ground balls. He allowed only 23 home runs in major league innings (0.5/9 rate).

==Personality==
Fidrych captured the imagination of fans with his antics on the field. He would crouch down on the pitcher&#x27;s mound and fix cleat marks, in what became known as &quot;manicuring the mound,&quot; talk to himself, talk to the ball, aim the ball like a dart, strut around the mound after every out, and throw back balls that &quot;had hits in them,&quot; insisting they be removed from the game. He would also walk around to shake hands with the infielders after they made great plays
in the field. Because the Tiger coaches were somewhat superstitious about jinxing Fidrych&#x27;s success, Bruce Kimm, a rookie catcher, caught each of Fidrych&#x27;s outings.

As his success grew, Tiger Stadium crowds would chant &quot;We want the Bird, we want the Bird&quot; at the end of each of his home victories. The chants would continue until he emerged from the dugout to tip his cap to the crowd. While these &quot;curtain calls&quot; have become more common in modern sports, they were less so in mid-1970s baseball. In his 18 appearances at Tiger Stadium, attendance equaled almost half of the entire season&#x27;s 81 home games. Teams started asking Detroit to change its pitching rotation so Fidrych could pitch in their ballparks, and he appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, including &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (twice, including once with &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character Big Bird), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (as of 2015, the only baseball player ever to appear on the cover of the rock and roll magazine), and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. In one week, Fidrych turned away five people who wanted to be his agent, saying, &quot;Only I know my real value and can negotiate it.&quot;

Fidrych also drew attention for the simple, bachelor lifestyle he led in spite of his fame, driving a green subcompact car, living in a small Detroit apartment, wondering aloud if he could afford to answer all of his fan mail on his league-minimum $16,500 salary, and telling people that if he hadn&#x27;t been a pitcher, he&#x27;d have been happy pumping gas in Northborough.

At the end of his rookie season, the Tigers gave him a $25,000 bonus and signed him to a three-year contract worth $255,000. Economists estimated the extra attendance Fidrych generated around the league in 1976 was worth more than $1 million. Fidrych also did an Aqua Velva television commercial after the 1976 season. He was considered for the role of the jock Tom Chisum in &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), a role that ultimately went to Lorenzo Lamas.

==Death==
According to the Worcester County District Attorney&#x27;s Office, a family friend found Fidrych dead beneath his ten-wheel dump truck at his Northborough home around 2:30 p.m. on April 13, 2009. He appeared to have been working on the truck at the time of the accident. Authorities said Fidrych suffocated after his clothes had become entangled with a spinning power takeoff shaft on the truck. The Massachusetts State Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office ruled the death an accident, according to a release from the Worcester County District Attorney&#x27;s office.

Joseph Amorello, owner of a road construction company who had occasionally hired Fidrych to haul gravel or asphalt, had stopped by the farm to chat with him when he found the body underneath the dump truck. &quot;We were just, in general, getting started for the [road-building] season this week and it seems as though his truck was going to be needed. It looked like he was doing some maintenance on it,&quot; Amorello said in a telephone interview. &quot;I found him under the truck. There&#x27;s not much more I can say. I dialed 911 and that&#x27;s all I could do.&quot;
Fidrych was cremated and a memorial service was held in his honor. Thousands of people came to pay their respects.

A 2012 wrongful death suit filed by Fidrych&#x27;s widow was dismissed by a Massachusetts appeals court in November 2017. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that the companies in question did provide warnings and that their equipment was free of design defects. Further, the court decreed that the companies had no legal duty to provide any such warnings because Fidrych modified the truck.

==Honors and tributes==
Fidrych was inducted into the Shrine of the Eternals of the Baseball Reliquary in 2002.

In one of Bill James&#x27; baseball books, he quoted the Yankees&#x27; Graig Nettles as telling about an at-bat against Fidrych, who, as usual, was talking to the ball before pitching to Nettles. Immediately Graig jumped out of the batter&#x27;s box and started talking to his bat. He reportedly said, &quot;Never mind what he says to the ball. You just hit it over the outfield fence!&quot; Nettles struck out. &quot;Damn,&quot; he said. &quot;Japanese bat. Doesn&#x27;t understand a word of English.&quot; Nettles actually hit Fidrych very well in his career, though, with a .389 average [7-for-18] and two home runs.

On April 15, 2009, the Tigers paid tribute to Fidrych at Comerica Park with a moment of silence and a video before their game against the Chicago White Sox.

At the time of his death he was about to be inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted posthumously on June 18, 2009.

On June 19, 2009, Jessica Fidrych honored her father at Comerica Park by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch to manager Jim Leyland for the Tigers game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Prior to throwing out the first pitch, Jessica &quot;manicured the mound&quot; just like her father. Ann Fidrych, widow of Mark Fidrych, was also present on the field for the ceremony.

The Baseball Project, a band that specializes in songs about baseball, honored Fidrych in their song &quot;1976&quot;.

The Varsity Baseball Field at Algonquin Regional High School is named in honor of Mark Fidrych.

<doc id="326446" wikidata="Q840297" url="?curid=326446" title="El Mariachi">
<text>El Mariachi () is a 1992 Spanish language American independent neo-Western action film and the first part of the saga that came to be known as Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Mexico Trilogy&quot;. It marked the feature-length debut of Rodriguez as writer and director. The Spanish language film was shot with a mainly amateur cast in the northern Mexican border town of Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila, Mexico across from Del Rio, Texas, the home town of leading actor Carlos Gallardo as the title character. The US$7,225 production was originally intended for the Mexican home-video market, but executives at Columbia Pictures liked the film and bought the American distribution rights. Columbia eventually spent $200,000 to transfer the print to film, to remix the sound, and on other post-production work, then spent millions more on marketing and distribution.

The success of Rodriguez&#x27;s directorial debut led him to create two sequels (&quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;) with Antonio Banderas taking over from Gallardo for the character, though Gallardo co-produced both films and had a minor role in &quot;Desperado&quot;.

The film received acclaim from critics. In 2011, &quot;El Mariachi&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film is also recognized by Guinness World Records as the lowest-budgeted film ever to gross $1 million at the box office.

==Plot==
After breaking out of jail in a small Mexican town, a ruthless criminal, nicknamed Azul, ventures off with a guitar case full of weapons and vows revenge on the local drug lord, Moco, who had him arrested in the first place. Meanwhile, a young musician arrives in town carrying his own guitar case which contains his signature guitar. He hopes to find work in the town in order to pursue his dream of becoming a mariachi like his father.

From the confines of his heavily guarded villa on the outskirts of town, Moco sends a large group of Sicarios to kill Azul. They are told to look for a man who is wearing black and carrying a guitar case, but because the Mariachi also matches this description, the hitmen mistake him for Azul and start pursuing him. Only Moco, however, knows Azul&#x27;s actual face. The Mariachi is then forced to kill four of the attackers in self-defense after being chased through the streets. As the Mariachi seeks refuge in a bar owned by a beautiful woman named Dominó, he quickly falls in love with her. Unfortunately, Moco is not only financing the bar, but also has his own romantic interest in Dominó.

When Azul visits the bar for a beer and information about Moco, he accidentally leaves with the Mariachi&#x27;s guitar case. Moco&#x27;s thugs capture Azul on the street but release him when they learn that the case he is carrying contains only a guitar. A short time later, the Mariachi is captured and taken to Moco, who identifies him as the wrong man and sets him free.

Meanwhile, Azul, who has no directions to Moco&#x27;s home, takes Dominó with him and orders her to take him to Moco&#x27;s, or Moco will kill the mariachi. Dominó agrees to save the Mariachi&#x27;s life. When they arrive at Moco&#x27;s gated compound, Azul pretends to take Dominó hostage in order to gain entry. Moco soon realizes that Dominó has fallen for the Mariachi and, in a fit of rage, shoots both her and Azul dead. Suddenly, the Mariachi arrives to find the woman he loves gunned down. Moco then shoots the Mariachi&#x27;s left hand, rendering him useless as a guitar player, and proceeds to taunt and laugh at the Mariachi. Overcome with grief and rage, the Mariachi picks up Azul&#x27;s gun with his right hand and kills Moco, avenging Dominó&#x27;s death. Moco&#x27;s surviving henchmen, seeing their leader dead, walk off carelessly and leave Moco&#x27;s body and the wounded Mariachi behind, as Moco had consistently treated them disrespectfully.

The Mariachi leaves the town on Dominó&#x27;s motorbike, taking her pit bull and her letter-opener as mementos of her. His dreams to become a mariachi have been shattered, and his only protection for his future are Azul&#x27;s former weapons, which he takes along in the guitar case. He rides off into the sunset.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot in numerous locations in Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila, located in Northeastern Mexico adjacent to Del Rio, Texas. The film used 16 mm film and was shot in 14 days. Rodriguez had a $7,000 budget (), almost half of which he raised by participating in experimental clinical drug testing while living in Austin, Texas. The opening scenes, featuring a shootout in a jail, were filmed at the local Acuña jail situated on the outskirts of the town. The female warden and the male guard were the real-life warden and guard; Rodriguez thought it was convenient because it saved him the cost of hiring actors and renting clothing. The intro bar scene was shot inside the Corona Club and exterior street scenes were shot on Hidalgo Street. The shootout was filmed outside at &quot;Boy&#x27;s Town&quot;, the local red-light district.

Not everyone in Acuña was pleased with the filming. Local journalists Ramiro Gómez and Jesús López Viejo were especially critical of the filming, and to win them over, Rodriguez gave them small parts in the film. Due to the high body count of the film, Rodriguez increasingly had difficulties finding adult men to play thugs, as dead characters obviously could not return; for that reason, when the Mariachi meets Moco&#x27;s gang at the end of the film, the gang consists mainly of teenagers.

On the &quot;El Mariachi&quot; DVD, Rodriguez devotes both a DVD commentary and an &quot;Extras&quot; section to explaining the tricks of filming a feature-length film with just $7,000. Rodriguez heavily stresses the need for cost cutting, &quot;because if you start to spend, you cannot stop anymore.&quot; This is why he cut costs at every possible opportunity. He did not use a slate; the actors, instead, signaled the number of scene and number of take with their fingers. He did not use a dolly, and instead held the camera while being pushed around in a wheelchair. He did not use synchronised sound; rather, he shot the film silent, then recorded on-set audio so it could be synced in post-production. Professional lighting was replaced by two 200-watt clip-on desk lamps. No film crew was hired; actors not in the scenes helped out instead. Rodriguez believed in filming scenes sequentially in one long take with a single camera; every few seconds, he froze the action, so he could change the camera angle and make it appear that he used multiple cameras simultaneously. Bloopers were kept in to save film: Rodriguez is visible on a bus with the Mariachi; the Mariachi bumps his weapon into a street pole; he fails to throw his guitar case on a balcony; and Dominó twitches her face when she is already dead. Rodriguez spared expense by shooting on 16 mm film as opposed to 35 mm, and transferred the film to video for editing, avoiding the costs of cutting on film. In the end, he used only 24 rolls of film and only spent $7,225 of the $9,000 he had planned.

Rodriguez gave insight into his low budget approach to simulate machine gun fire. The problem was that when using real guns, as opposed to the specially designed blank firing firearms used in most films, the blanks would jam the weapon after being fired once. To solve this, Rodriguez filmed the firing of one blank from different angles, dubbed canned machine gun sounds over it, and had the actors drop bullet shells to the ground to make it look like as if multiple rounds had been shot. In addition, he occasionally used water guns instead of real guns to save money. The squibs used in shootout scenes were simply condoms filled with fake blood and fixed over weightlifting belts.

Several aspects of the film were improvised. The tortoise that crawls in front of the Mariachi was not planned, but was kept in anyway. Similarly, there is a scene in which the Mariachi buys a coconut, but Rodriguez forgot to show him paying for the fruit; instead of driving back to the place to shoot additional scenes, Rodriguez decided to build in a voice-over in which the Mariachi asserts that the coconuts were for free. Improvisation was also useful to cover up continuity mistakes: at the end of the movie, the Mariachi has his left hand shot, but Rodriguez forgot to bring the metal glove to cover up the actor&#x27;s hand; he solved it by packing his hand with black duct tape.

In the DVD commentary, Rodriguez describes the acting of Peter Marquardt who portrayed gangster boss Moco. As the language of the film was Spanish, which Marquardt did not master, he had to learn his lines without understanding what he was saying. The running gag, in which Moco lights up his match using the moustache of his henchman Bigotón, was described by Rodriguez as a means to start and end the film: the end scene is a parody of this scene. When Moco was hit in the chest in the final shooting, Marquardt&#x27;s blood squib exploded with such force that he actually crumpled to the ground in pain.

Originally, the film was meant to be sold on the Latino video market as funding for another bigger and better project that Rodriguez was contemplating. However, after being rejected from various Latino straight-to-video distributors, Rodriguez decided to send his film (it was in the format of a trailer at the time) to bigger distribution companies where it started to get attention.

When the sequel &quot;Desperado&quot; was produced, Antonio Banderas replaced Gallardo as the actor for the main character of the series. The filmmakers re-shot the final showdown from &quot;El Mariachi&quot; as a flashback sequence for Banderas&#x27; character in &quot;Desperado&quot;.

===Music===
For the scene in which the Mariachi delivers a song in front of Dominó, Rodriguez hired Juan Francisco Suarez Vidaurri, a local entertainer. Recording the song with little more than a microphone held next to the musician, Rodriguez pitched the voice to match the voice of Mariachi actor Carlos Gallardo.

===Book===
The story of the film&#x27;s production inspired Rodriguez to write the book &quot;Rebel Without a Crew: Or How a 23-Year-Old Filmmaker with $7,000 Became a Hollywood Player&quot;, which chronicles this film&#x27;s origins, production and the eventual acclaim and success it achieved.

==Television adaptation==
Sony&#x27;s AXN channel confirmed that it would air TV series adaptation called &quot;El Mariachi&quot;. The series premiered on March 20, 2014.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

&quot;El Mariachi&quot; received universal critical acclaim. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes shows a 91% score based on 75 reviews, and an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Made on a shoestring budget, &quot;El Mariachi&quot; story is not new. However, the movie has so much energy that it&#x27;s thoroughly enjoyable.&quot; Metacritic reports a 73 out of 100 rating based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Awards and honors===
&quot;El Mariachi&quot; won multiple international awards, including the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature (beating out MTV Movie Award for Best Movie winner &quot;Menace II Society&quot;). Writer/producer/director Rodriguez went on to gain international fame; he was interviewed on such shows as &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot; and proceeded thereafter to secure Hollywood-backing for films such as &quot;The Faculty&quot; and &quot;Sin City&quot;. In December 2011, &quot;El Mariachi&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Citing it as the film that &quot;helped usher in the independent movie boom of the early 1990s&quot;, the Registry gave special mention to director Robert Rodriguez and his ability to merge two separate genres of films—&quot;the narcotraficante film, a Mexican police genre, and the transnational warrior-action film, itself rooted in Hollywood Westerns&quot;—successfully &quot;despite the constraints of a shoestring budget.&quot;
