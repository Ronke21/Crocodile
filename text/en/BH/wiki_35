==History==

Kawagoe is part of ancient Musashi Province and the area was heavily contested between the Later Hōjō clan and the two branches of the Uesugi clan, as they vied for control of the Kantō region. In the 1450s, Kawagoe was held by the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi Clan. Decades later, Hōjō Ujitsuna seized Kawagoe Castle in 1537, and the city served as an important base of operations when the Later Hōjō clan sought to gain control of the Kantō. For roughly two decades after that, the Uesugi launched a number of attempts to regain the region. This culminated in the 1545 Battle of Kawagoe, as the heavily outnumbered Hōjō garrison of Kawagoe defeated an attempted siege of Kawagoe Castle. This victory would lead to the end of Uesugi power in the region, and the near-total destruction of the clan. The Hōjō having secured themselves in the region, Kawagoe served for another forty-five years as a satellite castle town defending Edo, and the clan&#x27;s central castle at Odawara. Kawagoe&#x27;s location on the Arakawa River and near the Edo River were important elements of its tactical significance in defending the Kantō region from potential attacks from the north.

During the Edo period, Kawagoe Castle was the headquarters of the Kawagoe Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate, which had the largest &quot;kokudaka&quot; of any holding in the Kantō region outside of the control of the Tokugawa clan. The city prospered as a commercial and transshipment center and was nicknamed the &quot;kitchen of Edo&quot;. After the Meiji restoration, it briefly became capital of Kawagoe Prefecture (1871) then Iruma Prefecture (1871–1873), before becoming part of Saitama Prefecture.

The town of Kawagoe was created within Iruma District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. A large part of the town was destroyed in a fire on May 13, 1893 and was rebuilt with many structures using construction techniques of traditional &quot;kura&quot; warehouses. On December 1, 1922 Kawagoe merged with neighboring Senba Village, and was elevated to city status, with a population of 30,359.

The village of Tanomozawa was annexed in 1939. The city escaped World War II with only minor damage. The city expanded in 1955 by annexing the villages of Yoshino, Furuya, Minamifuruya, Takashina, Fukuhara, Daito, Kasumigaseki, Naguwashi and Yamada. In December 1999, the old core of Kawagoe was designated a Historic Preservation District. On April 1, 2003, Kawagoe was designated a core city with increased local autonomy.

<doc id="328438" wikidata="Q2454093" url="?curid=328438" title="Interstate 820">
<text>Interstate 820 (I-820) is an auxiliary route of I-20 in Fort Worth, Texas, of approximately around the city and some of its suburbs. Exit numbers begin at its interchange with I-20 in southwest Fort Worth and continue in a clockwise direction around the city until it ends at its interchange with I-20 in southeast Fort Worth. A portion of I-820 in the northeast quadrant is cosigned with State Highway 121 (SH 121) as well as SH 183.

The northwest segment of the loop is officially designated as the Jim Wright Freeway after former U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright. The name, however, is not commonly used; the colloquial reference by the general public is &quot;Loop 820&quot;, or simply just 820. Additionally, the area of the highway is given based on its direction from Downtown Fort Worth; for example, &quot;North Loop 820&quot; or &quot;East Loop 820&quot; respectively specify the areas to the north or east of downtown. These colloquial designations do not refer to the direction of traffic flow.

==Route description==
I-820 begins in the southwestern Fort Worth at an interchange with I-20. It heads north from this interchange to a junction with Spur 580 before reaching I-30 at a stack interchange. Continuing to the north, the Interstate begins to turn to the northeast as it approaches Lake Worth. It passes near Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth as it passes over Lake Worth. I-820 passes through the city of Lake Worth briefly with junctions at SH 199 and Farm to Market Road 1220 (FM 1220) before reentering Fort Worth city limits. Continuing to the northeast, a junction with Business U.S. Highway 287-P (Bus. US 287-P) provides access to Fort Worth Meacham International Airport. At an interchange with FM 156 in the city of Saginaw, I-820 begins to head toward the east. Continuing east, I-820 has a junction with I-35W at a stack interchange. The freeway enters the city limits of Haltom City at North Beach Street and has an interchange with US 377, before entering North Richland Hills. As it passes through North Richland Hills, the freeway turns toward the southeast briefly before turning back toward the east at SH 26. As it enters Hurst, the freeway has an interchange with concurrent SH 121 and SH 183. I-820 begins to head south after the interchange, now running concurrently with SH 121 and SH 183. At an interchange with SH 10, SH 183 leaves the concurrency to the west. At the next exit, SH 121 leaves I-820 toward the southwest. Continuing toward the south, I-820 leaves Hurst and reenters the Fort Worth city limits. Heading south through eastern Fort Worth, I-820 has a second junction with I-30, also at a stack interchange. After the interchange, the freeway continues south to a junction at SH 180 (Lancaster Avenue) and Spur 303 (Rosedale Street) near Lake Arlington. I-820 begins to follow the western shore of Lake Arlington to an interchange with US 287. I-820 and US 287 both continue to the south to an interchange with I-20 at the end of I-820.

==History==
The highway was first conceived in 1949 as a beltway around Fort Worth. It was originally designated from I-20 (now I-30) southeast, east, north, and west to I-35W. On April 18, 1963, I-820 was designated to use existing Loop 217 from SH 121 and SH 183 to Hulen Street while the section of Loop 217 from Hulen Street to US 377 was designated as Loop 820. On September 1, 1965, another section of Loop 820 from I-20 north and east to I-35W was designated. This section of Loop 820 from I-20 north and east to I-35W became part of I-820 on January 21, 1969, making I-820 a full loop. The first section to open ran from McCart Avenue to US 377 at a cost of $11 million (equivalent to $ in ). On May 13, 1977, the remainder of Loop 820 became part of an extension of SH 183. The southern leg of the loop was redesignated as I-20 on December 2, 1971, and finished construction in 1982, completing a continuous loop around Fort Worth. Despite no longer being officially designated as I-820 on the southern arc (which is officially part of I-20), it is still unofficially referred to as Loop 820 for business purposes, and the frontage roads and business addresses along the southern arc still bear the names &quot;SW Loop 820&quot; and &quot;SE Loop 820&quot;.

The loop is often considered the most congested road in North Texas, with the interchanges at Rufe Snow Drive, Holiday Lane, and Denton Highway (US 377) being named the first, second, and third worst, respectively, in 2010.

===North Tarrant Express===

The North Tarrant Express (NTE) was a construction project that was supposed to add additional lanes, high-occupancy toll lanes, and continuous frontage roads and reconstruct the interchange with I-35W and various other interchanges between I-35W and SH 121/SH 183. This plan, however, was modified, with the additional mainlanes not being built, though the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) plans to widen the freeway by no later than 2030. The NTE began construction in October 2010 and was completed in June 2015.

<doc id="328440" wikidata="Q387136" url="?curid=328440" title="Kawaguchi, Saitama">
<text>is a city located in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 607,373 in 293,582 households and a population density of 9800 persons per km². The total area of the city is . It is the Greater Tokyo Area&#x27;s 8th most populated city (after passing Hachioji), and second largest in Saitama Prefecture, after eponymous Saitama.

==Geography==
Kawaguchi is located near the center of the Kantō Plain in southern Saitama Prefecture, and is bordered by the Tokyo wards of Kita-ku and Adachi-ku to the south. The city area is mostly flat and mainly residential except for the Omiya tableland, which occupies part of the north and east area. The Arakawa River runs across the border with Kita-ku to the south.

===Surrounding municipalities===

* Koshigaya
* Saitama
* Sōka

===Climate===
Kawaguchi has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Kawaguchi is 14.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1482 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.6 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.2 °C.

==Demographics ==
As of 1 May 2010, registered population was 516,409, including 20,808 alien residents, continuing a trend of population growth in the city since 1933 when the city was founded. There has been a gradual increase in the number of non-Japanese residents living in the city because of the convenient location to Tokyo and relatively low rent. Now, the number of people from China is the largest, followed by Korea and Philippines.

Kawaguchi is a typical suburb city in the Tokyo metropolitan area, where the population greatly changes between daytime and nighttime due to commute to big cities, especially Tokyo. Its population growth rate declined in the mid-1990s, but recent apartment construction boom in the city has helped to increase the population growth rate again. The number of children continues to decrease in accordance with the declining number of births; in 2009, 4,735 live births were recorded in the city, a marked decrease from the 1971 peak of 7,932 births. By contrast, the rate of people aged 65 or over is increasing, and stood at approximately 18.5% as of 1 January 2010, although this is still below the national average.

In June 2023, 41,471 people in Kawaguchi were not Japanese citizens; 23,637 people of them held Chinese citizenship. 

==History ==
After the last ice age, during early and middle Jōmon period, most of the area which is now Kawaguchi was under sea level except for the area which is now Omiya Tableland. Ancient peoples living in this area left several shell middens, in which shells, Jōmon pottery, and pit houses have been discovered by archaeologists. Many Kofun period barrows were also found in Kawaguchi, however many have also been destroyed by urban development. From the Heian period onwards, Kawaguchi was part of Musashi Province. The name &quot;Kawaguchi&quot; appears in the Kamakura period chronicle &quot;Gikeiki&quot;, but it is not proven that this name designated current area of Kawaguchi.

During the Edo period, Kawaguchi-juku developed as a post station on the Nikkō Onari Kaidō, a highway used by the Tokugawa shōgun and daimyō to visit Nikkō Tōshō-gū. Towards the Bakumatsu period and into the Meiji period, the demand for metal products increased. Because of proximity to Tokyo and convenient water transportation using Arakawa River, Kawaguchi became the center of metal casting industry, for which it has remained famous until modern times.

The town of Kawaguchi was established within Kitaadachi District, Saitama on 1 April 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Kawaguchi was elevated to city status on April 1, 1933 by the merger of Kawaguchi with the neighboring villages of Aoki, Minami-Hirayanagi and Yokozone. The city expanded by annexing the town of Hatogaya and villages of Shiba, Kamine and Shingō in 1940. However, Hatogaya separated from Kawaguchi in 1948 in accordance with the results of a referendum.

Kawaguchi has experienced many disasters, including flood, earthquake, and war. The Arakawa River has inundated Kawaguchi countless times and ruined agriculture, which resulted in famines. Also, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake damaged buildings in Kawaguchi, killing 99 people.

Currently, the population of Kawaguchi continues to increase, and many tall apartment buildings are being built around train stations. This is because many casting foundries moved to suburban industrial parks and the former sites were turned into residential areas.

On 1 April 2001, Kawaguchi was designated a special city, with increased local autonomy.

On 11 October 2011, Kawaguchi re-absorbed the city of Hatogaya.
On 16 August 2018, the city of Kawaguchi and the City of Findlay, Ohio signed a &quot;Friendship City Agreement&quot;. The city of Findlay houses seven Japanese businesses such as Bridgestone, Hitachi Astemo, Nissin Brake, and more.

==Government==
Kawaguchi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 42 members. Kawaguchi contributes seven members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between Saitama 2nd district and Saitama 15th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

<text>is a city located in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 61,159 in 26,380 households and a population density of . The total area of the city is .

==Geography==

Chichibu is in the westernmost part of Saitama. Unlike other parts of the prefecture, it is largely mountainous and the population is concentrated in river terraces along the Arakawa River. It is Saitama&#x27;s largest municipality in terms of surface area and shares borders with Tokyo, Yamanashi, Nagano and Gunma Prefectures. A large portion of the city belongs to Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park.

Because the region is not suitable for growing rice, many people have traditionally depended on sericulture (silk farming). Limestone from Mount Bukō, which rises south of the city center, is another major source of income for the region. The city is shifting its focus toward sightseeing, taking advantage of its rich natural environment and relative closeness to the Tokyo metropolitan area. The city is also famous for its brewing industry.

Chichibu was incorporated as a city on April 1, 1950, although Chichibu Province had already existed since before the Nara period and the region has developed many local traditions. Chichibu Province was incorporated into Musashi Province in the 7th century AD. During premodern times, the town developed as a marketplace of the district as well as the town around Chichibu Shrine. The city&#x27;s older name, Ōmiya (&quot;big shrine&quot;), was derived from the shrine. Since its incorporation in 1950, the area of the city has grown through a series of mergers, the most recent in 2005.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
Two lines serve the city: the Chichibu Main Line and Seibu Chichibu Line. The Chichibu Railway was constructed along the Arakawa River and first opened in 1914. Seibu Railway reached the city in 1969 and considerably reduced the travel time to Tokyo. It takes approximately one and a half hours to travel from Seibu-Chichibu Station to Ikebukuro Station, one of the major train terminals in Tokyo. These lines carry people as well as limestone from Mount Bukō. The two lines were directly connected on April 1, 1989. Chichibu Railway also operated the Mitsumine Ropeway, which carried passengers visiting . The ropeway was taken out of service since May 19, 2006, and was officially abandoned on December 1, 2007.

===Highway===
Two national roads, Route 140 and 299, serve the city. Route 140 connects the city to its nearest expressway interchange, Hanazono Interchange of the Kan-Etsu Expressway. The city had no road communication to Yamanashi Prefecture due to steep Okuchichibu Mountains, but the opening of the Karisaka Tunnel in 1998 enabled the city to connect to Yamanashi.

==Local attractions==

On December 3, Chichibu holds an annual night festival (Intangible cultural heritage). It attracts crowds from Chichibu, Saitama prefecture, neighboring Tokyo, and the Kantō region. Kawase matsuri is Chichibu shrine&#x27;s summer festival. It takes place every July 19 and July 20. Eight groups carrying special &quot;dashi&quot; floats march along to festival music around the city. &quot;Mikoshi&quot; (sacred portable shrines) are brought to special places in each neighborhood where they are enshrined. Neighborhood association heads wash the &quot;mikoshi&quot; in the Arakawa River.

*Chichibu 34 Kannon Pilgrimage
*Chichibu Muse Park
*Chichibu Shrine
*Hitsujiyama Park
*Lake Chichibu
*Mitsumine Shrine
*Nakatsugawa Gorge
*Okuchichibu Mountains

==In popular media==
As a picturesque area within fairly easy reach of Tokyo, Chichibu has been much photographed. However, the photography of Chichibu by the Chichibu native Bukō Shimizu (1913–1995) is particularly extensive: Shimizu presented photographs of the mountains, people and customs of Chichibu in numerous books for the Japanese market, starting in 1954.

The town of Chichibu is the setting for the popular anime series &quot;&quot; and the anime films &quot;The Anthem of the Heart&quot; and &quot;Her Blue Sky&quot;, all of which were written by Mari Okada who was born in Chichibu.

=== Possible connection with &quot;The Mikado&quot; ===
The city considers itself as the inspiration for Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1885 comic opera, &quot;The Mikado&quot;; the name of the opera&#x27;s setting, &quot;Titipu&quot;, is pronounced &quot;Chichipu&quot; in Japanese. Rokusuke Ei, a popular essayist, was convinced that Chichibu, the site of a peasant uprising in 1884, inspired the author, W. S. Gilbert, to set the opera in Japan. Other Japanese researchers have concluded that Gilbert may simply have heard of Chichibu silk, an important export in the 19th century. A theatre company from Chichibu first presented &quot;The Mikado&quot; in Japanese in Chichibu on March 10, 2001, performed by local actors, and throughout other locations in Japan. In August 2006, it travelled with this production to the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton, England.

<text>is a city located in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 343,298 in 168,939 households and a population density of 4761 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Tokorozawa is located in the central part of the Musashino Terrace in southern Saitama, about 30 km west of central Tokyo. Tokorozawa can be considered part of the greater Tokyo area; its proximity to the latter and lower housing costs make it a popular commuter town. The Higashikawa and Yanasegawa rivers that flow from the Sayama Hills flow to the eastern part of the city, and finally reach the Arakawa River. The Yamaguchi Reservoir (commonly known as Lake Sayama) is mostly located within city boundaries; Lake Tama also touches the south-western part of the city.

The area around Tokorozawa Station&#x27;s west exit is built up as a shopping district with several department stores. Prope Street is a popular shopping arcade.

===Climate===
Tokorozawa has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Tokorozawa is 14.0 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1647 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.3 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tokorozawa has recently plateaued after several decades of strong growth.

==History==
Archaeological research has shown that the vicinity of Tokorozawa was settled from about 20,000 years ago. Tokorozawa Shinmei Shrine has a traditional establishment of 110 AD. Hatogamine Hachiman Shrine is believed to date from 921 AD. During the Kamakura period, the Kamakura Kaidō ran through the area and the area was host to a series of battles fought in May 1333 that were part of the Genko War that ultimately ended the Kamakura Shogunate. These include the 1333 Battle of Kotesashi and the Battle of Kumegawa. Kotesashi was again the site of another battle nineteen years later. During the Edo period (1603–1867) the area&#x27;s major industry was sericulture. It was also an important trading center, being located at the intersection of roads connecting Edo with the towns of Hachioji, Chichibu, Kawagoe and Fuchu.

The town of Tokorozawa was created within Iruma District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.

Tokorozawa became the site of Japan&#x27;s first air base and air service academy in 1911. The base was used through the end of World War II and fell under the control of the United States Armed Forces after the war. The US returned most of its property in Tokorozawa to Japan in 1971, but retains a communications facility in the city which is operated by the 374th Airlift Wing of the Fifth Air Force, based at Yokota Air Base to the southwest. The facility houses antennas for communications with USAF aircraft in the region. Much of the land returned to Japan has been converted into the public Tokorozawa Aviation Memorial Park.

Tokorozawa was elevated to city status on November 3, 1950. In 1955, Tokorozawa annexed the neighboring villages of Yanase and Mikajima, and assumed its present boundaries. The development of large scale public housing and railroad development led to a rapid population increase in the 1960s. Tokorozawa was the site of the Clay pigeon shooting event in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

Tokorozawa was designated as a special city with increased local autonomy in 2002. It currently meets the conditions to be designated as a core city but has yet to receive this designation.

==Government==
Tokorozawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 34 members. Tokorozawa contributes four members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Saitama 8th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

===Climate===
Asaka has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Ageo is 15.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1427 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.8 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.4 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Asaka has grown roughly tenfold since the 1950s.

==History==
The area of modern Asaka developed as a series of four post stations on the Kawagoe Kaidō highway from the Muromachi period onwards. During the Edo Period, the area was noted as a center for copper crafts. Following the Meiji restoration, the village of Hizaori was created within Niikura District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Niikura District was abolished in 1894 and became part of Kitaadachi District. It was raised to town status on May 1, 1921, and renamed Asaka after Prince Yasuhiko Asaka who was an honorary chairman of the Tokyo Golf Club, which relocated to the area at that time. On April 1, 1955, Asaka annexed the neighboring village of Uchimagi. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in neighboring Tokyo, the town hosted the riding part of the modern pentathlon event at Asaka Nezu Park. Asaka was elevated to city status on March 15, 1967. In 2005, a proposal to merge Asaka with Shiki, Wako, and Niiza to form a new city with a combined population sufficient to qualify for core city status was defeated in a referendum, largely due to opposition from Wako.

==Government==
Asaka has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 24 members. Asaka contributes two members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Saitama 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Due to its location, Asaka is primarily a bedroom community with over 37% of its population commuting to the Tokyo metropolis for work. The area is also a distribution hub for northern Tokyo.

==Education==
Asaka has ten public elementary schools and five public middle schools operated by the city government, and two public high schools operated by the Saitama Prefectural Board of Education. Toyo University also has a campus in Asaka.

==History==
Archaeological examination of several sites around Wakō has revealed the remains of a number of villages in the area, including a large amount of Jōmon period pottery, stone tools and other remains. Signs of early rice cultivation coinciding with the Yayoi period as well as quantities of Yayoi period pottery and implements have also been found. The area of modern Wakō developed from the Muromachi period as Shirako-juku, a post station on the Kawagoe-kaidō highway.

The villages of Shirako and Niikura were created within Niikura District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Niikura District was abolished in 1894, becoming part of Kitaadachi District. The two villages were merged on April 1, 1943, becoming the town of Yamato. Yamato was elevated to city status on October 31, 1970 and was renamed Wakō.

==Local attractions==

===Myoten-ji===
This temple was consecrated by Sudagoro Tokimitsu, the local administrator of Shimoniikura (1278–1287). A statue of Nichiren and a wooden plaque with the inscription: &quot;Namu myoho rengekyo&quot; reside in the temple. They are important treasures of Wakō city.

===Koyasu no Shimizu (Temple for safe childbirth)===
Per local legend, Nichiren called at the house of his old friend, Tokimitsu while on his way to exile in Sado. Tokimitsu&#x27;s wife was going through a difficult childbirth. When Nichiren prayed for a safe delivery and made a blessing with a willow twig a spring of pure water sprang up on the spot. Nichiren then had Tokimitu&#x27;s wife hold the willow twig while water from the spring was poured into her mouth whereupon she soon gave birth to a healthy baby boy. There used to be a large willow tree beside the pond at the temple, and it is said that this tree grew from the twig that Nichiren used to bless the birth. The tree is no longer there today.

===Kawagoe Kaidō===
The Kawagoe Kaidō was a highway completed in 1633 when the third &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu visited Kawagoe Senpa Tōshōgū (Shinto shrine). At that time, Kawagoe Castle played an important role in governing the northern part of Musashi Province. Kawagoe was 10 &quot;Ri&quot; (about ) from Nihonbashi in the old part of Edo and there were six &quot;shukuba&quot; along the way, namely: Kamiitabashi, Shimonerima, Shirako, Hizaori, Ōwada, and Ōi. These post stations were officially regulated settlements catering to travelers. Shirako-juku was from Edo and travelers often stopped there for lunch. After a steep winding hill and with ample spring water, Shirako-juku was a good rest stop. Travelers came from the direction of Nittazaka then went up O-saka and down Kurayami-zaka, which was dark even in the daytime.

===Choshōji (Temple of the Shingon Sect)===
The origin of this Shingon sect temple pre-dates the Edo period. The temple was dedicated to the Juichimen Kannon (Kannon with eleven faces). The wooden statue may have been made at the beginning of the Edo period. There is a huge Ginkgo tree in the temple grounds. The tree is estimated to be over 700 years old, has a diameter of more than 7.5 meters and stands nearly 30 meters tall. It is designated as a natural monument of the Wako City.

===Ikkan-ji , Gorintō Pagoda===
Ikkan-ji is a Sōtō sect temple built during the Kan&#x27;ei era (1624–43) and was consecrated by Sakai Tadashige, a local administrator of Shimoniikura in the Edo period. It served as the family temple of the Sakai clan. &quot;Gorintō&quot;, or stone five level pagodas were placed at graves as a memorial and to console the spirits of the departed. Three &quot;gorinto&quot; can be found at Ikkan-ji at the graves of Tadashige Sakai, his wife, and a former administrator&#x27;s wife.

<text>is a city located in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 92,512 in 44,288 households and a population density of 5100 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Located in far southeastern Saitama Prefecture at an elevation of only three meters above sea level, Yashio is on the central reaches of the Naka River, and is approximately 20 kilometers from downtown Tokyo.

===Surrounding municipalities===
* Saitama Prefecture
** Misato
** Sōka
* Tokyo Metropolis
** Adachi
** Katsushika

===Climate===
Yashio has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Yashio is 14.9 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1482 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.4 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Yashio has increased rapidly over the past 60 years.

==History==
The area of modern Yashio was settled in the Kofun period and was part of Shimōsa Province from the Nara period. During the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, the area was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled directly by the shogunate. After the Meiji restoration, the area was transferred to the new Saitama Prefecture in 1871 and divided into villages with the creation of the modern municipalities system in 1889. The village of Yashio was created within Minamisaitama District, Saitama with the merger of the villages of Shiodome, Hachijō and Yahata on 28 September 1956. It was raised to town status on 1 October 1964 and to city status on 15 January 1972.

January 28, 2025: a sinkhole opened up near the Chuo 1-chome intersection, where Saitama Prefectural Route 54 Matsudo-Soka Line, Shiodome Street, and Josuijo Street (&quot;Water Treatment Facility&quot; Street) intersect. A truck drove into the sinkhole within seconds of it opening; the 74-year-old driver has not been rescued as of February 5. The cause of the sinkhole is believed to be massive leakage from a damaged sewer pipe buried under the prefectural road. The sewage of 12 municipalities flows through this sewer pipe on its way to a nearby sewage treatment facility. The Saitama Prefectural government has called on the 12 municipalities that use this sewer pipe to limit their sewage use, affecting a total of approximately 1.2 million people in the 12 cities and towns. Inability to stop the flow has led to enlargement of the sinkhole, greatly hindering rescue operations.

==Government==
Yashio has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 21 members. Yashio contributes one member to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Saitama 14th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Due to this location, Yashio is primarily a distribution center, with a number of industrial parks. It is also bedroom community with part of its population commuting to the Tokyo metropolis for work.

==Education==
Yashio has ten public elementary schools and five public middle schools operated by the city government, and two public high schools operated by the Saitama Prefectural Board of Education.

==Geography==
Located in east-central Saitama Prefecture, Hasuda is directly north of the prefectural capital of Saitama City. It consists of the Hasuda Plateau in the center of the city, which is part of the Omiya Plateau, the Shiraoka (Kurohama) Plateau in the east, with Motoara River in between, and the lowlands around the Ayase River that runs west and south.

===Surrounding municipalities===

* Kuki

===Climate===
Hasuda has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Hasuda is 14.7 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1363 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.8 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hasuda peaked around the year 2000 and has declined slightly in the decades since.

==History==
The area of modern Hasuda has been settled since the prehistoric period, and there are numerous archaeological sites, including shell middens and burial mounds within the city limits. In addition, traces of samurai residences and castles from the Sengoku period remain. Much of what is now Hasuda was part of Iwatsuki Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji restoration, the village of Ayase was created within Minamisaitama District with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on October 1, 1934, and renamed Hasuda. Hasuda annexed the neighboring villages of Kurohama and Hirano on May 3, 1954, and was elevated to city status on October 1, 1972.

On March 31, 2010, Hasuda was to be merged with the neighboring town of Shiraoka (from Minamisaitama District). However, the merger was canceled shortly after Shiraoka managed to grow its population to 50,000 people, qualifying it as a city.

==Government==
Hasuda has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 20 members. Hasuda contributes one member to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Saitama 13th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Due to this location, Hasuda is primarily a bedroom community with over half of its population commuting to neighboring Saitama City or to the Tokyo metropolis for work. However, much of the city remains agricultural.

== Education ==
Hasuda has eight public elementary schools and five public middle schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Saitama Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped.

** Noda
* Saitama Prefecture

The average annual rainfall is 1408 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.8 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.1 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Yoshikawa has nearly quadrupled over the past 50 years.

==History==
The area of Yoshikawa was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory within Shimōsa Province during the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. In 1871, it was transferred to the new Saitama Prefecture. The village of Yoshikawa was created within Kitakatsushika District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on November 1, 1915. On March 1, 1955, Yoshikawa annexed the neighboring villages of Asahi and Miwanoe. The population began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and Yoshikawa was elevated to city status on April 1, 1996. (Modern-day)Yoshikawa&#x27;s land is owned by the &quot;Yoshikawa&quot; family of Japan, dating back centuries ago. Although they did lose an unknown amount of their real estate after WW2, they are still considered to be tycoons in Japan&#x27;s real estate economy. The Yoshikawa family is known to be very private about their wealth, putting it in untouched accounts, and not spending their generation&#x27;s worth of wealth. Instead, they are known to be big donators to the many people living in Yoshikawa. Foreigners living there have long complained of the highly prejudiced police force and city civil servants.

In terms of national politics, the city is part of Saitama 14th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

<doc id="328483" wikidata="Q48851" url="?curid=328483" title="AFC Wimbledon">
<text>AFC Wimbledon is an English professional association football club based in Wimbledon, London Borough of Merton, London. The team compete in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system.

The club was founded in 2002 by former supporters of Wimbledon F.C. after the Football Association allowed that club to relocate to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, about north of Wimbledon. Most of the Wimbledon supporters were very strongly opposed to moving the club so far away from Wimbledon, feeling that a club transplanted to a distant location would no longer represent Wimbledon or the club&#x27;s historic legacy and tradition. Wimbledon moved in 2003 and formally changed the name of the club to Milton Keynes Dons in 2004.

When AFC Wimbledon was formed, it affiliated to both the London and Surrey Football Associations, and entered the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League, the ninth tier of English football. The club has since been promoted six times in 13 seasons, going from the ninth tier (Combined Counties Premier) to the third (League One).

AFC Wimbledon currently hold the record for the longest unbeaten run of league matches in English senior football, having played 78 consecutive league games without a defeat between February 2003 and December 2004. They are the first club formed in the 21st century to make it into the Football League.

The club was initially based at Kingsmeadow, a ground bought from and then shared with Isthmian League club Kingstonian until 2017, and with Chelsea Women from 2017. In November 2020, the club moved to Plough Lane, a new stadium on the site of the defunct Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, only 250 yards away from the original Plough Lane, Wimbledon&#x27;s home until 1991. The new stadium has an initial capacity of 9,215.

On 28 May 2002, the Football Association approved a decision by a three-person arbitration commission they had appointed to allow Wimbledon to relocate north to the new town of Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire; a decision influenced, among other factors, by claims from Wimbledon chairman Charles Koppel that such a move was necessary in order to prevent the club from going bankrupt.

Although the absence of a ground in Milton Keynes meeting Football League criteria meant that the club were unable to physically move for over a year, major organised protests at the decision continued to be held by Wimbledon&#x27;s traditional local support and a boycott of the club&#x27;s home matches at Selhurst Park meant attendances dwindled immediately.

Following the F.A.&#x27;s announcement of their decision, a group of Wimbledon supporters led by Kris Stewart and fellow founding members Marc Jones and Trevor Williams met in The Fox and Grapes pub on Wimbledon Common to plan what was to be done next as part of the protest. It was agreed that as there was no right of appeal, the only option was to start the club again from scratch. On 30 May 2002, the idea was put forward in a Wimbledon Independent Supporters&#x27; Association meeting to create a new community-based club named AFC Wimbledon and an appeal for funds was launched.

On 13 June 2002, a new manager, a playing strip and badge based on that of the original Wimbledon, and a stadium were unveiled to fans and the media at the packed-out Wimbledon Community Centre. In order to assemble a competitive team at very short notice, AFC Wimbledon held player trials on 29 June 2002 on Wimbledon Common, open to any unattached player who felt he was good enough to try out for the team. The event attracted 230 hopeful players, from whom the club&#x27;s squad for their inaugural season was eventually chosen.

=== Badge ===
The double-headed eagle comes from Wimbledon’s coat of arms. On the right wing is a gold rose from the badge of King Edward I, and on the left wing a gold fret, a fret is a (piece of interlaced work) from the arms of Merton Priory. Merton is the borough in which Wimbledon lies. 

===Non-League football (2002–2011)===

====Combined Counties League (2002–2004)====
In the 2002–03 season, AFC Wimbledon competed in the Combined Counties League Premier Division under the management of former Wimbledon player Terry Eames, who was appointed on 13 June 2002. Their first ever game, a pre-season friendly against Sutton United on 10 July 2002, resulted in a 4–0 loss in front of a crowd of 4,657. At the end of their debut season, AFC Wimbledon finished third in the league and narrowly failed to win promotion to the Isthmian League First Division, despite a strong end to the season that involved winning their final 11 league fixtures.

In 2003–04, AFC Wimbledon won their first 21 league games before a 2–2 draw against Sandhurst Town on 10 January 2004, giving them 32 consecutive wins in league games over two seasons. Manager Terry Eames was suspended on 13 February 2004 and sacked five days later on the grounds of gross misconduct, after evidence was produced which showed him to have firstly made unauthorised and untrue representations to a number of the coaching staff, secondly, that he had falsely informed members of the coaching staff that the club had decided not to support his plans for youth football and required him to make immediate budgetary cut-backs and thirdly that he dispensed with the services of members of the coaching staff citing untrue reasons. Assistant manager Nick English took charge with immediate effect. The team went on to finish as champions of the Combined Counties League with an unbeaten record for the season of 42 wins and four draws. AFC Wimbledon also won the league&#x27;s Premier Challenge Cup after beating North Greenford United 4–1 in the Final on 30 April 2004, completing a double for the season.

====Isthmian League (2004–2008)====
Dave Anderson was appointed as new manager on 11 May 2004. Under his leadership AFC Wimbledon took their good form into the 2004–05 season during which they competed in the Isthmian League First Division — they remained top of the division for the duration of the season, and were convincing title-winners, sealing promotion to the League&#x27;s Premier Division. The Dons secured another double by defeating Walton &amp; Hersham 2–1 in the Final of the Surrey Senior Cup on 3 May 2005. Over the course of the season, AFC Wimbledon set a new record for the longest run of unbeaten league games at any level of senior football in the United Kingdom. The team remained unbeaten for 78 league matches between 22 February 2003 (a 2–0 defeat at home to Withdean 2000) and 4 December 2004 (a 2–0 defeat at Cray Wanderers). 

The 2005–06 season proved far more competitive than previous seasons – as after winning their first few games, AFC Wimbledon found themselves struggling to remain in the play-off places. After fluctuating form, they eventually reached the play-offs after a 1–0 win against Anderson&#x27;s former club, Hendon, on 22 April 2006. However, a 2–1 defeat at Fisher Athletic on 2 May 2006 prevented the club from achieving three back-to-back promotions. The Dons once again reached the final of the Surrey Senior Cup, however, this time they were narrowly defeated 1–0 by Kingstonian in a fiercely contested derby.

Much of the 2006–07 season was overshadowed by the threat of a proposed 18-point deduction by the FA for the club&#x27;s fielding of Jermaine Darlington who, it transpired, had not been registered correctly by the club and had therefore played in three games whilst still officially ineligible. However, this punishment was eventually reduced to a three-point deduction and a £400 fine on appeal, after the FA finally acknowledged that the club had made a simple administrative error. The &#x27;Darlington affair&#x27; also resulted in expulsion from the Surrey Senior Cup and the FA Trophy that year. Although AFC Wimbledon did enough to qualify for the play-offs, they once again missed out on promotion, this time as a result of losing 1–0 to Bromley in the play-off semi-final on 1 May 2007. Manager Dave Anderson subsequently left the club by mutual consent on 2 May 2007.

Terry Brown was appointed as the new AFC Wimbledon manager on 15 May 2007. During 2007–08, he led the club to promotion to the Conference South in his first season in charge, a feat which predecessor Dave Anderson had proved unable to achieve, having lost two consecutive play-off final opportunities in the previous two seasons. The Dons made steady progress throughout the season, qualifying for the play-offs after finishing third in the League. AFC Wimbledon beat Hornchurch 3–1 in the play-off semi-final on 29 April 2008 and went on to triumph 2–1 over Staines Town in the play-off final on 3 May 2008.

====The Conference (2008–2011)====
AFC Wimbledon spent most of the 2008–09 season near the top of the league table, eventually finishing as champions and earning promotion to the Conference Premier after defeating St Albans City 3–0 on 25 April 2009. The match set an attendance record of 4,722 for Kingsmeadow stadium, which at that time was full capacity.

The 2009–10 season was the club&#x27;s first in the Conference Premier. Overall, the Dons finished eighth, 14 points short of the play-off zone. This was the first season in which the club had failed to make the top five in the league table.

In 2010–11, AFC Wimbledon finished as runners-up of the Conference Premier, qualifying for the play-offs. The Dons faced fifth placed Fleetwood Town in the play-off semi-finals, whom they went on to thrash 8–1 on aggregate. This aggregate scoreline set a record as the largest winning margin recorded since the Conference Premier first introduced the play-off system at the beginning of the 2002–03 season. In the play-off final at the City of Manchester Stadium on 21 May 2011, in front of a crowd of 18,195, AFC Wimbledon beat Luton Town 4–3 in a penalty shoot-out, after the match had ended 0–0 in extra time. The victory resulted in promotion to the Football League and represented the club&#x27;s fifth promotion in nine years. The club&#x27;s achievement of attaining League status after just nine seasons of existence is considered to be one of the fastest ascents for a new club since automatic promotion to the Football League first commenced in the 1980s. AFC Wimbledon also hold the record of being the first club to be formed in the 21st century to make it into the Football League, making them the youngest club in the Football League by some distance.

===Football League (2011–present)===

The 2011–12 season saw AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s promotion to League Two. The team started the season well, winning seven out of their first 12 matches, but failed to keep the momentum going and had a poor run, eventually finishing the season ranked 16th, 10 points clear of the relegation zone.
The 2012–13 campaign marked the tenth anniversary of AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s inaugural season. After an abysmal start to the season, manager Terry Brown was sacked on 19 September 2012 along with assistant manager Stuart Cash, with AFC Wimbledon sitting just above the relegation zone. First team coach Simon Bassey took over as caretaker manager with immediate effect. Bassey was in charge just four matches, however, before former Wimbledon player Neal Ardley was appointed as Terry Brown&#x27;s permanent replacement on 10 October 2012, naming former Watford and Cardiff City teammate Neil Cox as his assistant manager. On 2 December 2012, AFC Wimbledon faced Milton Keynes Dons in the second round of the FA Cup, in the first ever meeting between the two sides following the relocation of Wimbledon to Milton Keynes, with the match ending as a 2–1 defeat for AFC Wimbledon. The Dons secured their Football League status on the final day of the 2012–13 season, despite having started the day in the relegation zone, by beating Fleetwood Town 2–1 at Kingsmeadow on 27 April 2013.

In the 2013–14 season, a match involving AFC Wimbledon was at the centre of a failed match-fixing plot. Shortly after the club&#x27;s 1–0 loss against Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on 26 November 2013, businessmen Krishna Ganeshan and Chann Sankaran and three Whitehawk players—Michael Boateng, Moses Swaibu and Hakeem Adelakun—were charged with conspiracy to commit bribery over a failed plot to fix the game. Ganeshan, Sankaran and Boateng were convicted. The club had a disappointing season overall, only managing to replicate the 20th placed league finish of the season before after the club were docked three points for the ineligible fielding of Jake Nicholson after failing to obtain international clearance for him after he joined from Scottish Championship side Greenock Morton on 19 February 2014.

The 2014–15 season saw AFC Wimbledon face Milton Keynes Dons once again in a competitive fixture on 12 August 2014 in the first round of the Football League Cup, with MK Dons eventually winning the match 3–1. The two sides met once again on 7 October 2014, with AFC Wimbledon achieving a first 3–2 win over their rivals in the second round of the Football League Trophy following a late goal from Adebayo Akinfenwa. The Dons also reached the FA Cup third round for the first time in their history on 5 January 2015, eventually succumbing 2–1 to Liverpool with Steven Gerrard scoring both goals. AFC Wimbledon finished the season in a mediocre 15th place after a disappointing run of form saw them finish the season without a win in their last eight league fixtures. 

The 2015–16 season was AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s fifth consecutive season in League Two. Despite getting the season off to a mediocre start, the Dons finished the season strongly, winning seven out of their last ten league matches to ensure that the club would confirm their highest ever League Two finish of seventh place and qualification for the 2016 Football League play-offs. A record home attendance of 4,870 turned out to see AFC Wimbledon beat Accrington Stanley 1–0 in the first leg of the play-off semi-final on 14 May 2016 (exactly 28 years to the day since the original Wimbledon won the 1988 FA Cup Final against Liverpool) following a dramatic extra time winner from academy product Tom Beere. This goal ultimately proved to be the difference between the two sides as AFC Wimbledon went on to win 3–2 on aggregate after a 2–2 draw in the reverse fixture. This win earned them a place in the play-off final at Wembley against Plymouth Argyle. The fixture was scheduled for 30 May 2016, exactly 14 years to the day since the club&#x27;s foundation. AFC Wimbledon ultimately triumphed 2–0 on the day in front of a crowd of 57,956.

The 2016–17 season saw AFC Wimbledon compete in League One for the first time in their history. They remained unbeaten in the South London derby fixtures, recording two draws against Millwall, a home draw against Charlton Athletic, and a 2–1 away win at The Valley on 17 September 2016. Promotion also placed AFC Wimbledon in the same division as Milton Keynes Dons, who had simultaneously been relegated from the Championship. This ensured the club would face Milton Keynes Dons for the first time at Kingsmeadow which they did on 14 March 2017, going on to triumph 2–0. The club ultimately finished 15th in the league, after a disappointing slump saw them win just five out of their last 22 league matches between January and April.

AFC Wimbledon made an equally slow start to the 2017–18 campaign, managing just five wins in their first 20 league matches between August and December. On 3 December 2017, the club recorded a 3–1 win over South London derby rivals Charlton Athletic in the second round of the FA Cup. The club were subsequently rewarded by being drawn away against Tottenham Hotspur in the third round with the match being played at Wembley on 7 January 2018. On 13 December 2017, the club received a further boost after being granted permission to begin work on constructing a new 9,300-seater stadium (which could be expanded to hold up to 20,000 in the future) on the site of Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium. The new ground will be only away from the original Plough Lane (1912–98), Wimbledon&#x27;s home from 1912 until 1991. The club was eventually able to secure another season in League One with a draw in their penultimate game, meaning that for the first time, AFC Wimbledon would be playing in a higher division than the Milton Keynes Dons, who were relegated that season.

AFC Wimbledon saw a disastrous start to the 2018–19 season, losing twelve of their first seventeen league games. Manager Neal Ardley departed the club by mutual agreement on 12 November 2018 after a tenure of 6 years, 1 month, 2 days, making him the longest serving manager to date. One bright spot in their season was the club&#x27;s first ever appearance in the FA Cup 5th Round after beating West Ham United 4–2 in the 2018–19 FA Cup. On 4 December 2018, Glyn Hodges joined Wally Downes as AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s assistant manager. After being rooted to the bottom of the table for most of 2019, they lost only 1 of their last 12 league games to lift them out of the relegation zone, ultimately staying up on goal difference on the last day of the season after a 0–0 draw with already relegated Bradford City. On 25 September 2019, Glyn Hodges took over the management of the first team on a temporary basis following the suspension of Wally Downes after being charged by the FA for betting misconduct. 

===Plough Lane===
In November 2020, the club moved to Plough Lane, a new stadium, only 250 yards away from the original Plough Lane, Wimbledon&#x27;s home until 1991. The club played its first match at the new stadium on the evening of 3 November 2020; a 2–2 draw against Doncaster Rovers. The club&#x27;s youth coach, Mark Robinson, replaced Hodges on 30 January 2021, after a run of poor results; Robinson turned the season around and the club avoided relegation on the second-last matchday. At the end of the 2021–22 season, Wimbledon were unable to avoid relegation from League One, finishing in 23rd position. Following relegation, Johnnie Jackson was appointed as the new manager.

==Season-by-season record==
==Crest and colours==
The club crest, which is based on the coat of arms of the Municipal Borough of Wimbledon, features a black double headed eagle in reference to a local legend that Julius Caesar once made camp on Wimbledon Common, this symbol being his own attributed coat of arms.

The colours that were chosen for the AFC Wimbledon kit were the royal blue and yellow traditionally associated with the rise of the original Wimbledon to the top of the Football League (rather than the darker navy blue and yellow that Wimbledon were wearing at the time, which had been a recent adaptation in 1993). The first ever kit, which was used only during the pre-season friendlies of 2002, consisted of a royal blue shirt, white shorts and white socks. Since then, the home kit has always been predominantly all royal blue with yellow detailing. The away kit used between 2002 and 2004 was white, however since then it has usually been predominantly yellow with blue detailing.

To mark their first game in the Football League on 6 August 2011 against Bristol Rovers, the team wore a white and blue commemorative kit which was based on that worn by the original Wimbledon during 1977–78 in order to remember their own first season as a member of the Football League in the old Fourth Division (now League Two). To prevent copyright infringement, a single blue stripe replaced the three trade mark stripes of the Adidas original and the shirts were emblazoned with a modified crest for the occasion.

On 14 May 2020, the club released a new, slightly modified, official club crest to mark 32 years since Wimbledon&#x27;s 1988 FA Cup victory, as well as the forthcoming opening of the new stadium at Plough Lane.

===Sponsorship and kit manufacturer===

AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s shirts have been sponsored by computer games developers Sports Interactive since the club&#x27;s inception in 2002. The kit used by the club is currently manufactured by Umbro. Previous manufacturers have been Umbro (2002, 2023–present), Tempest Sports (2002–2014), Admiral Sportswear (2014–2018), Puma (2018–2022), and Hummel (2022–2023). Other club sponsors are Cherry Red Records, author and YouTuber John Green,

In April 2022, the club announced that it would be switching its kit manufacturer for start of the 2022–23 season to Hummel, a nostalgic link up with the kit manufacturer of the former Wimbledon in three seasons from 1988–89 to 1990–91.
On 6 March 2023, AFC Wimbledon announced they would be switching kit manufacturer from Hummel to Umbro due to Hummel UK distributor Elite Sports Group going into bankruptcy administration.

==Mascot==
In 2006, AFC Wimbledon introduced a new mascot to represent the club, a Womble known as &quot;Haydon&quot; after Haydons Road, the nearest railway station to both Wimbledon&#x27;s original home ground, Plough Lane (1912–98), and the current Plough Lane.

When the club relocated to Milton Keynes in 2003 permission to use the then mascot Wandle the Womble was not renewed as owners of the Wombles brand no longer wished to be associated with Wimbledon FC. 

==Rivalries==

===Milton Keynes Dons===
The most obvious of AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s rivals are Milton Keynes Dons, the club which resulted from the relocation of Wimbledon to Milton Keynes in 2003. However, there is some debate amongst AFC Wimbledon supporters as to whether this should be considered a rivalry. Since some supporters do not recognise the legitimacy of the club, it is argued they cannot be considered rivals. The two sides have met four times in cup competitions, all games at Milton Keynes, of which AFC Wimbledon have won one and one game went to penalties. Owing to MK Dons&#x27; relegation from the Championship in the 2015–16 season, alongside AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s promotion from League Two, AFC Wimbledon and Milton Keynes Dons competed in the same league division for the first time in the 2016–17 season. Both clubs won one and lost one in that season&#x27;s league matches. In the nine league matches played between the clubs, Wimbledon won one, drew three and lost five.

===Crawley Town===
One of AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s main rivals have been Crawley Town. This is purely due to their frequently fractious meetings at a non-League level since 2009. The two sides did not play each other between 2012 and 2015 due to Crawley&#x27;s promotion to League One. However, Crawley&#x27;s relegation during the 2014–15 season meant the two sides played each other on 15 August 2015 which the Dons won 2–1. Between Wimbledon&#x27;s 2016 promotion into League One and 2022 relegation into League Two, they met just once competitively in the second round of the 2020–21 FA Cup with Crawley Town winning 2–1. With both teams back in the same league since the 2022–23 season, they have met two times, with the home team winning each fixture.

===Sutton United===
AFC Wimbledon had never shared a league with Sutton United before 2022, but due to the geographical proximity the two clubs share a friendly rivalry. Sutton were the first team to play the reformed Dons on 10 July 2002, defeating them 4–0 at Gander Green Lane. Before they met in the FA Cup in 2017, the most recent competitive match between the two sides was in the 2013 Surrey Senior Cup semi-final at Gander Green Lane on 11 April 2013, a game which Sutton won 5–2. The clubs played each other in the third round of the FA Cup on 7 January 2017, which resulted in a 0–0 draw. The replay took place at Kingsmeadow on 17 January 2017, with Sutton winning 3–1. The two clubs will both be in League Two for the 2022–23 season.

==Stadium==

===Plough Lane===


Since its inception in 2002, AFC Wimbledon had stated that one of its primary aims was to play in Merton, with a new stadium close to what it regards as its &quot;spiritual home&quot; of the original Plough Lane, where the original Wimbledon had played for over 80 years. This aim formed the basis of a project to create a new purpose-built stadium on the site of the Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, located on Plough Lane approximately 250 yards from where the old football stadium had stood.

Plans to develop the greyhound stadium site as either a multi-purpose stadium or as a football stadium were publicised frequently by the club and the media prior to 2013. In 2013, AFC Wimbledon announced that discussions were underway with Merton Council over a joint bid for the greyhound stadium and surrounding land, in cooperation with developer Galliard Homes, to build a new football stadium, 600 residential units and a wide range of shops and community facilities.

The plans for the football stadium were approved unanimously by Merton Council on 10 December 2015. Clearance of the site in preparation for the new football stadium and housing was begun on 16 March 2018. The stadium&#x27;s opening was initially planned for summer 2019, however, delays caused the approximate completion date to be moved to 25 October 2020. The land&#x27;s freehold was transferred to an AFC Wimbledon subsidiary on 24 December 2018, among other transactions that also formally transferred ownership of Kingsmeadow to Chelsea. The new stadium has an initial capacity of 9,215, with the option of expansion to a maximum 20,000 at a later date.

Wimbledon played the first four home matches of the 2020–21 season at Loftus Road whilst Plough Lane was being completed. The club played its first match at Plough Lane on the evening of 3 November 2020 with a 2–2 draw against Doncaster Rovers.

===Loftus Road===
AFC Wimbledon started the 2020–21 season at Loftus Road, after agreeing a temporary groundshare agreement with Queens Park Rangers, while construction of Plough Lane was completed. They played four league games at the ground, plus two cup ties, before departing at the end of October 2020. Due to the coronavirus restrictions in place at that time, all of the club&#x27;s games at Loftus Road were played behind closed doors.

===Kingsmeadow===


The club played at the 4,850 capacity Kingsmeadow in Kingston upon Thames until May 2020. Until 2017, AFC Wimbledon groundshared with Kingstonian with the Dons being the landlords and Kingstonian the tenants since the summer of 2003; before then the roles were reversed. In November 2015, AFC Wimbledon supporters voted to approve the selling of Kingsmeadow to Chelsea to help fund a planned new ground in Merton, On 13 December 2017, the contract was signed for the new stadium to be built, with Kingstonian leaving the ground in 2017 as a result.

====Ground purchase and debt====
Upon their foundation in 2002, AFC Wimbledon entered into a ground–sharing arrangement with Kingstonian to play home fixtures at Kingsmeadow in the neighbouring borough of Kingston upon Thames.

After Kingstonian entered administration to avoid bankruptcy and lost the Kingsmeadow lease in October 2001, it was assigned in April 2002 by the administrators to a property developer, Rajesh Khosla, who was also by then owner of the club.

After an SGM, it was felt by the AFC Wimbledon board of directors that securing ownership of Kingsmeadow would safeguard the ground for the future of both clubs. In March 2003, the Dons Trust members voted to purchase part of the lease for Kingsmeadow and in June 2003 the contract for buying the lease to the stadium was agreed with Rajesh Khosla; £3 million needed to be raised.

AFC Wimbledon were already sub-tenants at Kingsmeadow, before raising £2.4 million to buy the lease from Khosla in June 2003, with a view to making Kingsmeadow their home. Kingstonian secured a 25-year sub-tenancy agreement with AFC Wimbledon, with customary break clauses. The clubs operated a ground-sharing arrangement, with Kingstonian receiving preferentially cheap rental terms.

====Expansion====
At the end of the 2011–12 season, AFC Wimbledon commenced work on building a new 1,000 capacity all-seater stand to replace the existing Kingston Road End. This was completed by 13 October 2012 game against Cheltenham Town which saw an attendance of 4,409. The new stand was named the North Stand before being renamed The Nongshim Stand and in July 2015 the John Green Stand following sponsorship deals. The work increased the stadium capacity to approximately 4,850 with 2,265 seats.

====Sale====
In 2015, AFC Wimbledon agreed plans to sell Kingsmeadow to Chelsea in order to help finance their plans to move to a new stadium in Merton. Chelsea&#x27;s intention was to use the ground for their own youth and women&#x27;s teams and were not willing to accommodate Kingstonian. This was met with protests from Kingstonian fans, as the club would be left without a home ground of their own. Since the sale, Kingstonian have had to groundshare with Leatherhead and then Corinthian-Casuals. AFC Wimbledon departed Kingsmeadow in May 2020.

==Ownership and legal status==
AFCW plc was placed under the ownership of The Dons Trust, a supporters&#x27; group which is pledged to retain at least 75% control of that ownership. In 2003, a minority interest was sold in a share issue in order to finance the purchase of Kingsmeadow; given the circumstances of the club&#x27;s formation, this decision raised concerns among some members but was quickly accepted.

The Dons Trust is an industrial and provident society registered with the Financial Services Authority as &quot;Wimbledon Football Club Supporters&#x27; Society Limited&quot;. This is not to be confused with Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association (WISA) although WISA has as one of its stated constitutional aims &quot;to purchase shares in AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s holding company&quot;.

The original chief executive was Erik Samuelson, a retired accountant, who carried out his full-time duties in return for the nominal sum of one guinea a year, because &quot;it sounded posher than a pound&quot;. Samuelson retired in 2019; he was replaced by the club&#x27;s former COO, Joe Palmer.

==Community work==
The club places great emphasis on its role as a social focus for the entire local community, and part of this role is to offer the chance to play football to all. For this reason AFC Wimbledon established the Community Football Scheme (CFS) in 2004. On 1 May 2010, AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s Community Football Scheme was awarded the FA Charter Standard Community Club Award, the highest graded award attainable in the FA Charter Standard Club Programme, in recognition of the club&#x27;s outstanding coaching facilities in the local community. The club offer a number of different football courses open to children of any ability aged 4–14, who receive coaching from FA qualified coaches. The club aim to reach as many children as possible through their football and multi-sports programme by having vital links with their surrounding boroughs, most notably Merton and Kingston, which has allowed them to become one of the main providers of sports coaching in their local community.

AFC Wimbledon also offers a Schools Coaching Programme in Merton, Kingston and neighbouring boroughs. The club look to encourage a healthy and active lifestyle for both Primary and Secondary school children through football and a range of other sports. The sessions are run with an emphasis on learning, development and health awareness in a fun coaching environment. On 15 March 2012, coaches from the CFS, in partnership with the Football League&#x27;s main sponsor nPower, engaged in a community outreach scheme promoting the FA&#x27;s &#x27;Respect&#x27; campaign to school pupils. Nearly 2,000 children aged 10 and 11 were taught how abusive verbal and physical behaviour on the pitch to both players and referees should never be tolerated under any circumstances. The aim of the nationwide &#x27;Respect&#x27; scheme in schools is to eradicate racism, homophobia, violence and dissent from the next generation of footballers and supporters.

On 27 March 2012, AFC Wimbledon became the first football club to be presented with the Prime Minister&#x27;s Big Society Award for outstanding contributions to the local community. The club was recognised for the honour because it offers a wide range of community development schemes including 19 youth and women&#x27;s teams, school health and sport projects (hundreds of children a week participate in the outreach schemes provided) and a range of innovative activities, including a stadium school to help children get to grips with maths by using football as a teaching aid.

Congratulating AFC Wimbledon on receiving the award, then Prime Minister David Cameron said:

Accepting the award, Erik Samuelson, chief executive of AFC Wimbledon stated:

A group formed by the club&#x27;s fans, the Dons Local Action Group, stepped up during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, ensuring community members were distributed sufficient food and that students locked down at home had the technology they needed to keep up with classes.

===Notable former players===
===Wimbledon Old Players Association===
As part of WISA&#x27;s campaign to try and reclaim the history of Wimbledon Football Club, the Wimbledon Old Players Association (WOPA) was formed in 2005. Membership of WOPA is open to all former Wimbledon and AFC Wimbledon players and managers. Among the sixty founding members were Glenn Mulcaire, who scored AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s first ever goal in 2002 and Kevin Cooper, who remains the club&#x27;s all-time highest goal scorer with 107 goals between August 2002 and May 2004, as well as retaining the title for the most goals scored in a season with 66 during 2003–04. Others that joined included some of the legends of the old Wimbledon, such as John Fashanu, Dave Beasant, Efan Ekoku, Neil Sullivan, Dave Bassett, Wally Downes, Marcus Gayle, Neal Ardley, Alan Kimble, Andy Thorn, Roger Joseph, Dickie Guy, Allen Batsford, Roger Connell, Ian Cooke, Roy Law and Steve Galliers. On 16 July 2006, WOPA fielded a team in the Masters Football Tournament at Wembley Arena, with AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s backing. The team included Carlton Fairweather, Scott Fitzgerald, Marcus Gayle and Dean Holdsworth.

In June 2010, Vinnie Jones, another former player of Wimbledon, donated his 1988 FA Cup winners medal to the fans of AFC Wimbledon. The medal is on display at Wimbledon in Sporting History&#x27;s Museum at Plough Lane.

===Managerial history===
These statistics incorporate results for league matches (including Play-off matches) and results in all major League Cup competitions (including the Combined Counties League Premier Challenge Cup, the Isthmian League Cup, the Conference League Cup, the Football League Cup and the Football League Trophy) as well as results in the FA Vase, the FA Trophy and the FA Cup.

&quot;* Terry Eames was suspended as manager on 13 February for disciplinary reasons, but was not officially dismissed until 18 February 2004. Following his suspension, the role was undertaken by his assistant Nicky English.&quot;

&quot;** Wally Downes was suspended as manager on 25 September 2019 after he was charged by the Football Association over bets placed on games, with his assistant Glyn Hodges taking over his duties. Downes was not officially dismissed until 20 October 2019, when he was suspended by the FA after admitting breaching Football Association rules around betting. Hodges was then named his permanent replacement.&quot;

===Restarts coach and substitution coach===

In spring 2021, AFC Wimbledon appointed Andy Parslow as restarts coach, becoming the first English Football League club to appoint a specialist restarts coach.
In summer 2021, AFC Wimbledon appointed Sammy Landers as substitution coach, becoming the English Football League club to appoint a specialist substitution coach.

==Women==
AFC Wimbledon Women switched affiliation from Wimbledon after the 2002–03 season.

Kevin Foster is the manager and the team competes in the FA Women&#x27;s National League South.

Wimbledon Women&#x27;s former player Sophie Hosking won an Olympic gold medal for Team GB in the women&#x27;s lightweight double sculls at the London 2012 games. Hosking continues to be an avid supporter of AFC Wimbledon and demonstrated as such when she painted her fingernails in the club&#x27;s royal blue and yellow colours for the Olympic final at Dorney Lake on 4 August 2012.

Chōshi has been noted as a fishing port since ancient times. The commercial fishing and soy sauce industries were developed in Chōshi by the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period (1603–1868). Their development continued in the early industrialization of Japan in the Meiji period (1868–1912). The town of Chōshi was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Noted soy sauce producer Yamasa was incorporated in 1928, and Higeta in 1932. Chōshi was elevated to city status on February 11, 1933.

During the Heian period, this area was the center of the rebellion by Taira Masakado. During the Sengoku period, it was the site of a major battles (Battle of Kōnodai) between the Satomi clan and the Later Hōjō clan.

In more recent history, the area was also the site of some minor battles during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration and was promoted as a possible site for the new Diet of Japan by Katsu Kaishu, who envisioned a structure to be built on the Edogawa River similar to the Houses of Parliament in London along the River Thames. Ichikawa Town was organized in 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On November 3, 1934 Ichikawa merged with the neighboring towns of Yawata, Nakayama and village of Kokubun to form the city of Ichikawa. The city expanded by annexing the village of Okashiwa on November 3, 1949, the town of Gyotoku on March 31, 1955 and town of Minami-Gyotoku on October 1, 1956.

<text>was a city located in Katori District, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.

==History==
Sawara has been settled since prehistoric times, and has numerous remains of Jōmon period shell middens and Kofun period burial mounds. By the Nara period, it had developed as a port, and as a &quot;monzenmachi&quot; associated with Katori Shrine, and in the Heian period was a regional commerce center for numerous &quot;shōen&quot; in the area. During the Edo period, it was partly under the control of the Omigawa Domain, a feudal domain of the Tokugawa shogunate. Modern Sawara Town was created in 1889. Sawara-city established on March 15, 1951 through merger with neighboring town of Katori and the villages of Kasai and Higashi-Oto. It expanded further on February 11, 1955 through annexation of the neighboring villages of Mizuho, Shinshima, Tsunomiya and Okura.

In March 1996, Sawara established sister city relations with Nanjing in China.

In February 2006 (the last data available before its merger into Katori), the city had an estimated population of 47,244 and a population density of 394 persons per km2. Its total area was 119.88 km2.

On March 27, 2006, Sawara, along with the towns of Kurimoyo, Omigawa and Yamada (all from Katori District), was merged to create the city of Katori, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

==Geography==
Mobara is located in an inland area of north-central Bōsō Peninsula, about 25 kilometers from the prefectural capital at Chiba and 50 to 60 kilometers from the center of Tokyo. Most of the city is the Kujukuri Plain, and the mountains in the western part of the city are formed by the Bōsō Hill Range. The elevation of the city is about 8 to 9 meters above sea level in the lowlands of the southeast, about 11 meters in the city, and 20 to 100 meters in the west, with a maximum of 117.7 meters. In some areas, land subsidence due to human factors such as pumping of surface groundwater and natural gas brackish water has become a problem, and subsidence of up to about 10 cm has been observed.

The average annual rainfall is with October as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Mobara peaked around the year 2000 and has declined since.

==History==
===Early history===
Mobara was settled from the earliest times, as evidenced by archaeological sites and shell mounds dating from the Jōmon period and Yayoi periods. The city also has examples of &quot;kofun,&quot; or burial mounds, from the Kofun period. The area was the location of at least two &quot;shōen&quot; estates, the Mobara-sō and the Tachibana-sō, in the Heian period. At the beginning of the Edo period, in 1591, an extensive land survey was carried out by the Tokugawa clan.

===Modern history===
The town of Mobara was created during the early Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889 in Chōsei District. The Bōsō Tetsudo, now the JR Sotobō Line, was established in 1897 between Ichinomiya and Ōami Station in present-day Ōamishirasato. Mobara Station was one station established on the line, thus connecting Mobara to the wider rail network. In 1909 a handcar system ran from Mobara Station and Chōnan. The handcar railroad was constructed and operated by the prefecture.

===World War II===
A base for the 252 Air Group of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), a fighter aircraft unit, was established in Mobara. In 1941, by order of the IJN, 100 residences and their associated farmland, schools, town halls, police substations, temples, and shrines were forcibly confiscated without warning to build the base. Mobara Airfield was completed using a &quot;kinrō dōin&quot; group that consisted of the forced labor of Korean residents in Japan and students from Chōsei Middle School students in 1943. The airfield was located on the east banks of the small Aku River, directly to the east of Mobara Station along the present-day JR East Sotobō Line, and consisted of a runway and 20 structures, some of them concealed underground. &quot;Tokubetsu kōgekitai&quot;, or kamikaze units, were sent from Mobara Airfield to the IJN Kokubu Air Corps in present-day Kirishima, Kagoshima Prefecture to attack American forces off Okinawa. The United States confiscated the airfield shortly after the surrender of Japan in 1945. Remains of the runway, approximately ten airfield structures, and a tunnel are now on the property of the Mitsui Chemicals.

===Post-war history===

At the end of World War II, the 113th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army occupied the Mobara Airfield. The Japan Self-Defense Forces attempted to reoccupy the base in 1954, but after organized efforts by residents, agricultural organizations, the town and prefectural governments, the plans were abandoned the following year. The site was used to build Mobara Middle School for the rapidly expanding population of the town.

On April 1, 1952, Mobara Town expanded by annexation of neighboring villages of Tōgō, Toyoda, Ninomiya-Hongō, Tsurue, and Gogō and was elevated to city status. On April 1, 1955, Mobara annexed the town of Chōnan. On May 1, 1972, Mobara merged with the neighboring town of Honnō. On December 11, 1990, the city was hit by an F-3 tornado, which killed one person, injured 78, and damaged or destroyed 1,747 homes in the city.

==Government==
Mobara has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Mobara contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Chiba 11th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Mobara serves as a regional commerce center for surrounding Chōsei District. The economy of Mobara is dominated by electronics manufacturing. Futaba Corporation, a major manufacturer of radio control models and toys, is headquartered in Mobara. Natural gas production is also important to the city; Kanto Natural Gas Development Co., Ltd. and Otaki Gas Co., Ltd. have headquarters here. Chemical production, centered on Mitsui Chemicals, is the largest producer of iodine in Japan. 40% of the total world production of iodine is produced in Mobara. Much land in Mobara is still used for rice production. Additionally, &quot;negi&quot;, or the ubiquitous Welsh onion of Japanese cuisine, is an important agricultural product.

==Education==
Mobara has 14 public elementary schools and six public middle schools operated by the city government, and three public high schools operated by the Chiba Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school.

Narita has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Narita is . The average annual rainfall is with October as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Narita has recently plateaued after several decades of growth.

==History==
The area Narita has been inhabited since the Japanese Paleolithic period. Archaeologists have found stone tools dating to some 30,000 years ago on the site of Narita Airport. Numerous shell middens from the Jōmon period, and hundreds of burial tumuli from the Kofun period have been found in numerous locations around Narita. Place names in the vicinity of Narita appear in the Nara period &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; (although the name “Narita” does not appear in written records until 1408). As Narita is located roughly equidistant from the Pacific Ocean and Tokyo Bay, around a number of small rivers, it was a natural political and commercial center for the region, and gained importance as a pilgrimage destination with the foundation of the noted Buddhist temple of Shinsho-ji in 940 AD. During the Heian period, the area was a center for the revolt of Taira Masakado. During the Edo period, the area continued to prosper as part of the &quot;tenryō&quot; within Shimōsa Province under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate.

After the Meiji Restoration, the area was organized as a town under Inba District on April 1, 1889. Portions of the town were destroyed by Allied air raids in February and May, 1945. On March 31, 1954, Narita gained city status through merger with the neighboring villages of Habu, Nakago, Kuzumi, Toyosumi, Toyama, and Kozu. Growth in the area began in earnest in 1966, when Prime Minister Eisaku Satō laid out the plan for Narita International Airport. The development of the airport and accompanying access to central Tokyo led to widespread residential, commercial and industrial development in the city. However, construction of the airport was widely opposed, and violent demonstrations occurred through the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, which delayed the opening of the airport until May 20, 1978.

On March 27, 2006, the towns of Shimofusa and Taiei (both from Katori District) were merged into Narita.

==Government==
Narita has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 30 members. Narita contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Chiba 10th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Areas==
===Central Narita===
Central Narita is roughly defined as the area between Narita Station, Keisei Narita Station and the Narita-san Temple. The main road in central Narita is , which is lined with about 150 small shops and has been extensively renovated in recent years.

===Narita New Town===
Narita New Town is a planned residential area to the west of Narita Station. It has 16,000 homes with a total population of 60,000. The area was designed in 1968 based on the new towns surrounding London in the UK, and now houses most of the city&#x27;s population. Many residents of the area are airport or airline workers: the area houses corporate housing and dormitories for Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau and Japan Customs. There are also several Urban Renaissance Agency and other government-subsidized housing projects in the area.

===Kōzunomori===
Kōzunomori is a suburban area of Narita located south of the New Town, about 4 minutes by train from Keisei Narita Station. It has a population of about 12,000. Kōzunomori Station is flanked by a large Your Elm department store.

===Airport and farm areas===
Narita International Airport is located on the east side of Narita in a historically agricultural area called . The construction and later expansion of the airport led to intense civil unrest among Sanrizuka residents (see Narita International Airport&#x27;s history). Although land expropriation and poorer farming conditions due to the airport&#x27;s construction have caused Narita&#x27;s farming population to drop two-thirds from pre-airport levels, the area immediately surrounding the airport remains lightly populated by farmers.

===Industrial areas===
There are two main industrial zones in Narita: and . Both zones were laid out in the 1960s to take advantage of Narita Airport and the ability to quickly import and export goods by air. An aircraft part repair plant operated by JAL (Japan Airlines) and Pratt &amp; Whitney, called Japan Turbine Technologies, is located in the Taiei industrial estate.

==Economy==
Although Narita&#x27;s economy was historically focused on agriculture, the opening of Narita International Airport refocused the local economy on transportation, logistics and tourism. Most of the airport property is located within Narita City, but many airport hotels and airport-related logistics facilities are in the neighboring towns of Shibayama and Tomisato.

Prologis, FedEx Express, Sagawa Express and several other large logistics firms have major shipping centers in the city.

Nippon Cargo Airlines and Vanilla Air are headquartered on airport property within the city. Spring Airlines Japan is headquartered in the Kozunomori area of the city.

JALways was headquartered in the JAL Operations Center at the airport before merging into JAL in 2010.

==Education==
===Schools===
Narita has 24 public and one private elementary schools, one public combined elementary/junior high school, and nine public and one private junior high school. The public schools are under the control of the Narita City Board of Education. The city has four public high schools operated by the Chiba Prefectural Board of Education.

<text>The cherry blossom, or sakura, is the flower of trees in &quot;Prunus&quot; subgenus &quot;Cerasus&quot;. &quot;Sakura&quot; usually refers to flowers of ornamental cherry trees, such as cultivars of &quot;Prunus serrulata&quot;, not trees grown for their fruit (although these also have blossoms). Cherry blossoms have been described as having a vanilla-like smell, which is mainly attributed to coumarin.

Wild species of cherry tree are widely distributed, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. They are common in East Asia, especially in Japan, where they have been cultivated, producing many varieties.

Most of the ornamental cherry trees planted in parks and other places for viewing are cultivars developed for ornamental purposes from various wild species. In order to create a cultivar suitable for viewing, a wild species with characteristics suitable for viewing is needed. &quot;Prunus speciosa&quot; (Oshima cherry), which is endemic to Japan, produces many large flowers, is fragrant, easily mutates into double flowers and grows rapidly. As a result, various cultivars, known as the &quot;Cerasus&quot; Sato-zakura Group, have been produced since the 14th century and continue to contribute greatly to the development of hanami (flower viewing) culture. From the modern period, cultivars are mainly propagated by grafting, which quickly produces cherry trees with the same genetic characteristics as the original individuals, and which are excellent to look at.

The Japanese word sakura ( or ; or ) can mean either the tree or its flowers (see ). The cherry blossom is considered the national flower of Japan, and is central to the custom of hanami.

Sakura trees are often called Japanese cherry in English. (This is also a common name for &quot;Prunus serrulata&quot;.) The cultivation of ornamental cherry trees began to spread in Europe and the United States in the early 20th century, particularly after Japan presented trees to the United States as a token of friendship in 1912. British plant collector Collingwood Ingram conducted important studies of Japanese cherry trees after the First World War.

== Classification ==

Classifying cherry trees is often confusing, since they are relatively prone to mutation and have diverse flowers and characteristics, and many varieties (a sub-classification of species), hybrids between species, and cultivars exist. Researchers have assigned different scientific names to the same type of cherry tree throughout different periods.

In Europe and North America, ornamental cherry trees are classified under the subgenus &quot;Cerasus&quot; (&quot;true cherries&quot;), within the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;. &quot;Cerasus&quot; consists of about 100 species of cherry tree, but does not include bush cherries, bird cherries, or cherry laurels (other non-&quot;Cerasus&quot; species in &quot;Prunus&quot; are plums, peaches, apricots, and almonds). &quot;Cerasus&quot; was originally named as a genus in 1700 by de Tournefort. In 1753, Linnaeus combined it with several other groupings to form a larger &quot;Prunus&quot; genus. &quot;Cerasus&quot; was later converted into a section and then a subgenus, this system becoming widely accepted, but some botanists resurrected it as a genus instead. In China and Russia, where there are many more wild cherry species than in Europe, &quot;Cerasus&quot; continues to be used as a genus.

In Japan, ornamental cherry trees were traditionally classified in the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;, as in Europe and North America, but after a 1992 paper by Hideaki Ohba of the University of Tokyo, classification in the genus &quot;Cerasus&quot; became more common. This means that (for example) the scientific name &quot;Cerasus incisa&quot; is now used in Japan instead of &quot;Prunus incisa&quot;.

A culture of plum blossom viewing has existed in mainland China since ancient times, and although cherry trees have many wild species, most of them had small flowers, and the distribution of wild cherry trees with large flowers suitable for cherry blossom viewing was limited. In Europe and North America, there were few cherry species with characteristics suitable for cherry blossom viewing. In Japan, on the other hand, the &quot;Prunus speciosa&quot; (Oshima cherry) and , which have large flowers suitable for cherry blossom viewing and tend to grow into large trees, were distributed over a fairly large area of the country and were close to people&#x27;s living areas. The development of cherry blossom viewing, and the production of cultivars, is therefore considered to have taken place primarily in Japan.

Because cherry trees have mutable traits, many cultivars have been created for cherry blossom viewing, especially in Japan. Since the Heian period, the Japanese have produced cultivars by selecting superior or mutant trees from among the natural crossings of wild cherry trees. They were also produced by crossing trees artificially and then breeding them by grafting and cutting. Oshima, Yamazakura, &quot;Prunus pendula&quot; f. &quot;ascendens&quot; (syn, &quot;Prunus itosakura&quot;, Edo higan), and other varieties which grow naturally in Japan, mutate easily. The Oshima cherry, which is an endemic species in Japan, tends to mutate into a double-flowered tree, grows quickly, has many large flowers, and has a strong fragrance. Due to these favorable characteristics, the Oshima cherry has been used as a base for many Sakura cultivars (called the Sato-zakura Group). Two such cultivars are the Yoshino cherry and Kanzan; Yoshino cherries are actively planted in Asian countries, and Kanzan is actively planted in Western countries.

== &quot;Hanami&quot;: Flower viewing in Japan ==


 is the many centuries-old practice of holding feasts or parties under blooming ( or ; or ) or (; ) trees. During the Nara period (710–794), when the custom is said to have begun, it was blossoms that people admired. By the Heian period (794–1185), however, cherry blossoms were attracting more attention, and was synonymous with . From then on, in both and haiku, meant &quot;cherry blossoms,&quot; as implied by one of Izumi Shikibu&#x27;s poems. The custom was originally limited to the elite of the Imperial Court but soon spread to samurai society and, by the Edo period, to the common people as well. Tokugawa Yoshimune planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the trees, people held cheerful feasts where they ate, and drank .

Since a book written in the Heian period mentions , one of the cultivars with pendulous branches, &quot;Prunus itosakura&quot; &#x27;Pendula&#x27; (Sidare-zakura) is considered the oldest cultivar in Japan. In the Kamakura period, when the population increased in the southern Kantō region, the Oshima cherry, which originated in Izu Oshima Island, was brought to Honshu and cultivated there; it then made its way to the capital, Kyoto. The Sato-zakura Group first appeared during the Muromachi period.
&quot;Prunus itosakura&quot; (syn. &quot;Prunus subhirtella&quot;, Edo higan) is a wild species that grows slowly. However, it has the longest life span among cherry trees and is easy to grow into large trees. For this reason, there are many large, old specimens of this species in Japan. They are often regarded as sacred and have become landmarks that symbolize Shinto shrines, Buddhist temples, and local areas. For example, &quot;,&quot; which is around 2,000 years old, &quot;,&quot; which is around 1,500 years old, and &quot;,&quot; which is around 1,000 years old, are famous for their age.
In the Edo period, various double-flowered cultivars were produced and planted on the banks of rivers, in Buddhist temples, in Shinto shrines, and in daimyo gardens in urban areas such as Edo; the common people living in urban areas could enjoy them. Books from the period record more than 200 varieties of cherry blossoms and mention many varieties that are currently known, such as &#x27;Kanzan&#x27;. However, this situation was limited to urban areas, and the main objects of hanami across the country were still wild species such as and Oshima cherry.

Since Japan was modernized in the Meiji period, the Yoshino cherry has spread throughout Japan, and it has become the main object of hanami. Various other cultivars were cut down one after another during changes related to the rapid modernization of cities, such as the reclamation of waterways and the demolition of daimyo gardens. The gardener Takagi Magoemon and the village mayor of Kohoku Village, Shimizu Kengo, were concerned about this situation and preserved a few by planting a row of cherry trees, of various cultivars, along the Arakawa River bank. In Kyoto, Sano Toemon XIV, a gardener, collected various cultivars and propagated them. After World War II, these cultivars were inherited by the National Institute of Genetics, Tama Forest Science Garden and the Flower Association of Japan, and from the 1960s onwards were again used for hanami.

Every year, the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the public track the as it moves northward up the archipelago with the approach of warmer weather, via nightly forecasts following the weather segment of news programs. Since 2009, tracking of the &quot;sakura zensen&quot; has been largely taken over by private forecasting companies, with the JMA switching to focus only on data collection that than forecasting. The blossoming begins in Okinawa in January and typically reaches Kyoto and Tokyo at the beginning of April, though recent years have trended towards earlier flowerings near the end of March. It proceeds northward and into areas of higher altitude, arriving in Hokkaido a few weeks later. Japanese locals, in addition to overseas tourists, pay close attention to these forecasts.

Most Japanese schools and public buildings have cherry blossom trees planted outside of them. Since the fiscal and school years both begin in April, in many parts of Honshu the first day of work or school coincides with the cherry blossom season. However, while most cherry blossom trees bloom in the spring, there are also lesser-known winter cherry blossoms (&quot;fuyuzakura&quot; in Japanese) that bloom between October and December.

The Japan Cherry Blossom Association has published a list of Japan&#x27;s Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots (), with at least one location in every prefecture.

== Blooming season ==

Many cherry species and cultivars bloom between March and April in the Northern Hemisphere. Wild cherry trees, even if they are the same species, differ genetically from one individual to another. Even if they are planted in the same area, there is some variation in the time when they reach full bloom. In contrast, cultivars are clones propagated by grafting or cutting, so each tree of the same cultivar planted in the same area will come into full bloom all at once due to their genetic similarity.

Some wild species, such as Edo higan and the cultivars developed from them, are in full bloom before the leaves open. Yoshino cherry became popular for cherry-blossom viewing because of these characteristics of simultaneous flowering and blooming before the leaves open; it also bears many flowers and grows into a large tree. Many cultivars of the Sato-zakura group, which were developed from complex interspecific hybrids based on Oshima cherry, are often used for ornamental purposes. They generally reach full bloom a few days to two weeks after Yoshino cherry does.

=== Impacts of climate change ===
The flowering time of cherry trees is thought to be affected by global warming and the heat island effect of urbanization. According to the record of full bloom dates of in Kyoto, Japan, which has been recorded for about 1200 years, the time of full bloom was relatively stable from 812 to the 1800s. After that, the time of full color rapidly became earlier, and in 2021, the earliest full bloom date in 1200 years was recorded. The average peak bloom day in the 1850s was around April 17, but by the 2020s, it was April 5; the average temperature rose by about during this time. According to the record of full bloom dates of the Yoshino cherry in the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., the bloom date was April 5 in 1921, but it was March 31 in 2021. These records are consistent with the history of rapid increases in global mean temperature since the mid-1800s.

Japanese cherry trees grown in the Southern Hemisphere will bloom at a different time of the year. For example, in Australia, while the trees in the Cowra Japanese Garden bloom in late September to mid-October, the Sydney cherry blossom festival is in late August.

There&#x27;s an escalating concern of climate change as it poses a threat to sakura cultivars, given that they are highly susceptible to shifts in temperature and weather fluctuations. The changes, driven by climate change including warmer temperatures and earlier starts to springtime, may disrupt the timing of their blooms and potentially lead to reduced flowering and cultural significance.

In 2023, it has been observed in China that cherry blossoms have reached their peak bloom weeks earlier than they previously had a few decades ago. Similarly, data from Kyoto, Japan, and Washington, D.C., United States, also indicated that blooming periods are occurring earlier in those locations as well.

Although precise forecasting is generally challenging, AI predictions from Japan Meteorological Agency, have suggested that without substantial efforts to rein in climate change, the Somei-Yoshino cherry tree variety could face significant challenges and even the risk of disappearing entirely from certain parts of Japan, including Miyazaki, Nagasaki, and Kagoshima prefectures in the Kyushu region by 2100.

== Symbolism in Japan ==

Cherry blossoms are a frequent topic in &quot;waka&quot; composition, where they commonly symbolize impermanence. Due to their characteristic of blooming &quot;&quot;, cherry blossoms and are considered an enduring metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life. Cherry blossoms frequently appear in Japanese art, manga, anime, and film, as well as stage set designs for musical performances. There is at least one popular folk song, originally meant for the shakuhachi (bamboo flute), titled &quot;Sakura&quot;, in addition to several later pop songs bearing the name. The flower is also used on all manner of historical and contemporary consumer goods, including kimonos, stationery, and dishware.

=== &quot;Mono no aware&quot; ===
The traditional symbolism of cherry blossoms as a metaphor for the ephemeral nature of life is associated with the influence of Shinto, embodied in the concept of (the pathos of things). The connection between cherry blossoms and &quot;mono no aware&quot; dates back to 18th-century scholar Motoori Norinaga. The transience of the blossoms, their beauty, and their volatility have often been associated with mortality and the graceful and ready acceptance of destiny and karma.

=== Nationalism and militarism ===
The &quot;Sakurakai,&quot; or Cherry Blossom Society, was the name chosen by young officers within the Imperial Japanese Army in September 1930 for their secret society established to reorganize the state along totalitarian militaristic lines, via a military coup d&#x27;état if necessary.

During World War II, cherry blossoms were used as a symbol to motivate the Japanese people and stoke nationalism and militarism. The Japanese proverb &quot;hana wa sakuragi, hito wa bushi&quot; (&quot;the best blossom is the cherry blossom, the best man is a warrior&quot;) was evoked in the Imperial Japanese Army as a motivation during the war. Even before the war, cherry blossoms were used in propaganda to inspire the &quot;Japanese spirit&quot;, as in the &quot;Song of Young Japan&quot;, exulting in &quot;warriors&quot; who were &quot;ready like the myriad cherry blossoms to scatter&quot;. In 1894, Sasaki Nobutsuna composed a poem, &quot;Shina seibatsu no uta&quot; (The Song of the Conquest of the Chinese) to coincide with the First Sino-Japanese War. The poem compares falling cherry blossoms to the sacrifice of Japanese soldiers who fall in battles for their country and emperor. In 1932, Akiko Yosano&#x27;s poetry urged Japanese soldiers to endure suffering in China and compared the dead soldiers to cherry blossoms. Arguments that the plans for the Battle of Leyte Gulf, involving all Japanese ships, would expose Japan to danger if they failed were countered with the plea that the Navy be permitted to &quot;bloom as flowers of death&quot;. The last message of the forces on Peleliu was &quot;Sakura, Sakura&quot;. Japanese pilots would paint sakura flowers on the sides of their planes before embarking on a suicide mission, or even take branches of the trees with them on their missions. A cherry blossom painted on the side of a bomber symbolized the intensity and ephemerality of life; in this way, falling cherry petals came to represent the sacrifice of youth in suicide missions to honor the emperor. The first kamikaze unit had a subunit called &quot;Yamazakura&quot;, or wild cherry blossom. The Japanese government encouraged the people to believe that the souls of downed warriors were reincarnated in the blossoms.

=== Artistic and popular uses ===

Cherry blossoms have been used symbolically in Japanese sports; the Japan national rugby union team has used the flower as an emblem on its uniforms since the team&#x27;s first international matches in the 1930s, depicted as a &quot;bud, half-open and full-bloomed&quot;. The team is known as the &quot;Brave Blossoms&quot; (), and has had their current logo since 1952. The cherry blossom is also seen in the logo of the Japan Cricket Association and the Japan national American football team.

Cherry blossoms are a prevalent symbol in &quot;irezumi&quot;, the traditional art of Japanese tattoos. In this art form, cherry blossoms are often combined with other classic Japanese symbols like koi fish, dragons, or tigers.

The cherry blossom remains symbolic today. It was used for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics mascot, Someity. It is also a common way to indicate the start of spring, such as in the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series of video games, where many of the game&#x27;s trees are flowering cherries. 

== Cultivars ==

Japan has a wide diversity of cherry trees, including hundreds of cultivars. By one classification method, there are more than 600 cultivars in Japan, while the Tokyo Shimbun claims that there are 800. According to the results of DNA analysis of 215 cultivars carried out by Japan&#x27;s Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in 2014, many of the cultivars that have spread around the world are hybrids produced by crossing Oshima cherry and with various wild species. Among these cultivars, the Sato-zakura Group and many other cultivars have a large number of petals, and the representative cultivar is &quot;Prunus serrulata&quot; &#x27;Kanzan&#x27;.

The following species, hybrids, and varieties are used for &quot;Sakura&quot; cultivars:

* &quot;Prunus × takenakae&quot;
* &quot;Prunus × yedoensis&quot; (&quot;P. itosakura&quot; × &quot;P. speciosa&quot;)

The most popular cherry blossom cultivar in Japan is &#x27;Somei-yoshino&#x27; (Yoshino cherry). Its flowers are nearly pure white, tinged with the palest pink, especially near the stem. They bloom and usually fall within a week before the leaves come out. Therefore, the trees look nearly white from top to bottom. The cultivar takes its name from the village of Somei, which is now part of Toshima in Tokyo. It was developed in the mid- to late-19th century, at the end of the Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji period. The &#x27;Somei-yoshino&#x27; is so widely associated with cherry blossoms that &quot;jidaigeki&quot; and other works of fiction often show the trees being cultivated in the Edo period or earlier, although such depictions are anachronisms.

 is a representative cultivar that blooms before the arrival of spring. It is a natural hybrid between the Oshima cherry and &quot;Prunus campanulata&quot; and is characterized by deep pink petals. Wild cherry trees usually do not bloom in cold seasons because they cannot produce offspring if they bloom before spring, when pollinating insects become active. However, it is thought that &#x27;Kawazu-zakura&#x27; blooms earlier because &quot;Prunus campanulata&quot; from Okinawa, which did not originally grow naturally in Honshu, was crossed with the Oshima cherry. In wild species, flowering before spring is a disadvantageous feature of selection; in cultivars such as &#x27;Kawazu-zakura&#x27;, early flowering and flower characteristics are preferred, and they are propagated by grafting.

Cherry trees are generally classified by species and cultivar, but in Japan they are also classified using names based on the characteristics of the flowers and trees. Cherry trees with more petals than the ordinary five are classified as &quot;yae-zakura&quot; (double-flowered sakura), and those with drooping branches are classified as &quot;shidare-zakura&quot;, or weeping cherry. Most &quot;yae-zakura&quot; and &quot;shidare-zakura&quot; are cultivars. Famous &quot;shidare-zakura&quot; cultivars include &#x27;Shidare-zakura&#x27;, &#x27;Beni-shidare&#x27;, and &#x27;Yae-beni-shidare&#x27;, all derived from the wild species &quot;Prunus itosakura (syn, &quot;Prunus subhirtella&quot; or Edo higan)&quot;.

The color of cherry blossoms is generally a gradation between white and red, but there are cultivars with unusual colors such as yellow and green. The representative cultivars of these colors are and , which were developed in the Edo period of Japan.

In 2007, Riken produced a new cultivar named &#x27;Nishina zao&#x27; by irradiating cherry trees with a heavy-ion beam. This cultivar is a mutation of the green-petaled ; it is characterized by its pale yellow-green-white flowers when it blooms and pale yellow-pink flowers when they fall. Riken produced the cultivars &#x27;Nishina otome&#x27; (blooms in both spring and autumn, or year-round in a greenhouse), &#x27;Nishina haruka&#x27; (larger flowers), and &#x27;Nishina komachi&#x27; (&#x27;lantern-like&#x27; flowers that remain partially closed) in the same way.

All wild cherry trees produce small, unpalatable fruit or edible cherries, however, some cultivars have structural modifications to render the plant unable to naturally reproduce. For example, and , which originated from the Oshima cherry, have a modified pistil that develops into a leaf-like structure, and can only be propagated by artificial methods such as grafting and cutting. Cherry trees grown for their fruit are generally cultivars of the related species &quot;Prunus avium&quot;, &quot;Prunus cerasus&quot;, and &quot;Prunus fruticosa&quot;.

== Cultivation by country ==

In the present day, ornamental cherry blossom trees are distributed and cultivated worldwide. While flowering cherry trees were historically present in Europe, North America, Philippines, and China, the practice of cultivating ornamental cherry trees was centered in Japan, and many of the cultivars planted worldwide, such as that of &quot;Prunus × yedoensis&quot;, have been developed from Japanese hybrids.

The global distribution of ornamental cherry trees, along with flower viewing festivals or &quot;hanami&quot;, largely started in the early 20th century, often as gifts from Japan. However, some regions have historically cultivated their own native species of flowering cherry trees, a notable variety of which is the Himalayan wild cherry tree &quot;Prunus cerasoides&quot;.

== The origin of wild cherry species ==
The wild Himalayan cherry, &quot;Prunus cerasoides&quot;, is native to the Himalayan region of Asia, and is common in countries such as Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Myanmar, where it is also cultivated.

In 1975, three Japanese researchers proposed a theory that cherry trees originated in the Himalayan region and spread eastwards to reach Japan at a time before human civilisation, when the Japanese archipelago was connected to the Eurasian continent, and that cherry species differentiation was actively promoted in Japan.

According to Masataka Somego, a professor at Tokyo University of Agriculture, cherry trees originated 10 million years ago in what is now Nepal and later differentiated in the Japanese archipelago, giving rise to species unique to Japan.

According to the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, detailed DNA research has shown that the &quot;Prunus itosakura&quot; and the &quot;Prunus speciosa&quot;, which is endemic to Japan, differentiated into independent species 5.52 million years ago.

On the other hand, according to Ko Shimamoto, a professor at Nara Institute of Science and Technology, modern theories based on detailed DNA research reject the theory that the Himalayan cherry tree is the root of the Japanese cherry tree, and the ancestor of the cherry tree is estimated to be a plant belonging to the &quot;Prunus grayana&quot;.

According to HuffPost, it is a widely held consensus that the origin of the first cherry blossoms happened somewhere in the Himalayas, Eurasia but scholars posit that the blossoms may have reached Japan around several thousand years ago. In Japan, centuries of hybridization have brought about more than 300 varieties of the cherry blossom.

== Culinary use ==


Cherry blossoms and leaves are edible, and both are used as food ingredients in Japan:

* The blossoms are pickled in salt and umezu (ume vinegar), and used for coaxing out flavor in wagashi, a traditional Japanese confectionery, or anpan, a Japanese sweet bun most-commonly filled with red bean paste. The pickling method, known as , is said to date back to the end of the Edo period, though the general method of pickling vegetables in salt to produce &quot;tsukemono&quot; has been known as early as the Jōmon period.
* Salt-pickled blossoms in hot water are called sakurayu and drunk at festive events like weddings in place of green tea.
* The leaves are pickled in salted water and used for sakuramochi.
* Cherry blossoms are used as a flavoring botanical in Japanese Roku gin.

=== Toxicity ===
Cherry leaves and blossoms contain coumarin, which is potentially hepatotoxic and is banned in high doses by the Food and Drug Administration. However, coumarin has a desirable vanilla-like scent, and the salt curing process used prior to most culinary applications, which involves washing, drying, and salting the blossoms or leaves for a full day, reduces the concentration of coumarin to acceptable levels while preserving its scent. Coumarin may also be isolated from the plant for use in perfumes, pipe tobacco, or as an adulterant in vanilla flavorings, though the tonka bean is a more common natural source of this chemical.

Cherry seeds and bark contain amygdalin and should not be eaten.

Fukuoka Town was established on April 1, 1889, within Sōsa District, Chiba. It changed its name to Yōkaichiba on December 8, 1915. On March 31, 1954, the town expanded greatly through the annexation of the neighboring villages of Heiwa, Chinkai, Sōsa, Toyosaka, Suga, Kyōkō, Yoshida, Iidaka, and Toyowa, all within Sōsa District. Yōkaichiba was elevated to city status on July 1, 1954.

<doc id="328504" wikidata="Q637868" url="?curid=328504" title="Asahi, Chiba">
<text>is a city located in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 64,690 in 26,510 households and a population density of 500 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==History==
The Chiba clan, or branches of it, ruled the Shimōsa region for about 400 years from the Kamakura period. During the Sengoku period, the Chiba clan gained the protection of such powerful clans as the Odawara Hōjō clan, allowing them to get a stronger foothold over the area. They lost control when the Hōjō clan was overthrown in 1590 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After that, General Kiso Yoshimasa settled in the region. He restored the Ajito Castle, which was the inspiration for the name &quot;Asahi.&quot; When poet Nonoguchi Takamasa visited the area in 1852, he wrote a poem about the general, from which the name &quot;Asahi,&quot; which can mean &quot;rising sun,&quot; was taken:

&quot;from Shinano / 
adoring the rising sun / 
he came to the eastern land / 
and there remains the evidence of his earthly life&quot;

In the Edo period, various agricultural changes in the region occurred. The first was the reclamation of the &quot;Sea of Camellias&quot;, a vast lake, which was drained into the Pacific Ocean to create the fertile Higata Hachiman-goku. The second was spurred on by the arrival of agrarian scholar Ohara Yugaku in 1835 and other &quot;kokugaku&quot; scholars who helped to revive agriculture in the area. During this same time, while Iioka Sukegoro was helping to develop the fishing industry, fishermen from the Kansai region moved to the area to take advantage of the bountiful fishing grounds available.

The town of Asahi was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to city status on July 1, 1954. On July 1, 2005, the city of Asahi, the town of Hikata (from Katori District), and the towns of Iioka and Unakami (both from Kaijo District) merged on equal terms to form the new Asahi city.

In March 2011, the city was greatly affected by 9.0 magnitude earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent nuclear disaster. Around 15 people were killed, 2,265 buildings were damaged, with 427 buildings destroyed, 716 people were left homeless, and heavy damage was done to the town&#x27;s port and fishing boat fleet following the triple disaster.

<doc id="328511" wikidata="Q6300926" url="?curid=328511" title="Juan Roldán">
<text>Juan Domingo Roldán (6 March 1957 – 18 November 2020) was an Argentine professional boxer, best remembered for his strong showing in the early rounds of an undisputed world championship bout against Marvelous Marvin Hagler. After flooring Hagler in the opening seconds Roldan was able to further enjoy success against the dominant middleweight champion. Hagler significantly injured Roldán&#x27;s eye with the thumb of his glove. 
Roldán fought on, but was unable to continue and suffered a technical knockout. He retired for a couple of years before coming back with a campaign that took him to another middleweight world title bout, this time with Thomas Hearns. In an exciting contest, Roldán shook Hearns early, but succumbed to a Hearns attack in the fourth. A final world middleweight title fight with Michael Nunn resulted in a loss by KO, following which Roldán ended his professional boxing career. Nicknamed &quot;Martillo&quot; (&quot;Hammer&quot;) Roldán often featured on &quot;Ring En Español&quot; magazine.

==Career==

Roldán made his professional debut on December 8, 1978 in San Francisco, Argentina, defeating Jorge Servin via first-round knockout. His first four wins all came by first round knockouts. On May 11, 1979, Roldán went the distance for the first time when rival Hugo Obregón went ten rounds with him. Roldán won the fight on points. On September 21, 1979, he suffered the first defeat of his career to Juan Carlos Borgado, losing a ten-round decision.

Out of his next eighteen bouts, he won seventeen and drew (tied) once. He then challenged Jacinto Fernández on March 13, 1981, for the Argentine Middleweight title, winning a twelve-round decision. In his next fight, he beat José María Flores Burlón, a boxer who would later challenge Carlos De León for the world&#x27;s Cruiserweight title. Roldán won six more fights and drew one before challenging José Maria&#x27;s brother, Carlos Flores Burlón for the South American Middleweight title, on February 12, 1982. He won the title with a second-round knockout.

Before 1982 was over, he retained his Argentine Middleweight title with a first-round knockout of Marcos Perez, but losing on a disqualification in three rounds to Ricardo Arce. In an immediate rematch, Roldán put his Argentine title on the line and this time, he avenged his defeat to Arce with a second-round knockout win. After five more wins in a row, he fought Juan Carlos Peralta, with the fight resulting in a three-round no contest.

On May 27, 1983, Roldán made his international debut, with a 10-round decision over Teddy Mann in Rhode Island, United States. After retaining his Argentine title twice more, he was faced, on November 10, 1983, with one of the top rated Middleweights of the time, Frank &#x27;The Animal&#x27; Fletcher, at the undercard of the high-profile, Marvin Hagler vs. Roberto Durán world title fight in Las Vegas. Roldán dropped Fletcher twice on his way to a sixth-round knockout victory.

After this win, Roldán was ranked number 1 by the major boxing organizations, and he accordingly met Hagler for the undisputed world middleweight title on March 30, 1984. Seconds into round one, the quick starting Roldán became the first and only boxer to score an official knockdown against Hagler, who though not hurt was disconcerted. In round three, Hagler was credited with a knockdown which was also dubious, after Roldán had got his feet tangled with the ring&#x27;s ropes. Roldán showed less recklessness than previously in this contest, and utilizing his innate hand speed and a style difficult for southpaws to defend against, he landed scoring punches for the next few rounds while pressing the action. Though not rocking Hagler, they were considered surprising by commentators in view of his skills and Roldán&#x27;s crude technique. However, by the middle of the bout, Hagler was winning every exchange. After being floored in the tenth, a swollen and cut Roldán quit, giving Hagler a win by technical knockout. The October after this bruising loss, Roldán announced his retirement. His knockdown of Hagler signaled the beginning of a renowned champion&#x27;s decline, but none of the diminished Hagler&#x27;s subsequent opponents were able to duplicate Roldán&#x27;s feat which remained unique.

In 1986, Roldán reconsidered his decision and made a comeback. He won thirteen bouts in a row, including one over James Kinchen, before he challenged for a world title again. On October 29, 1987, at Las Vegas, Thomas Hearns became the first boxer to win world titles in four different divisions when he beat Roldán in four rounds by knockout, but not before Roldán had Hearns in trouble in rounds three and four.

On September 16, 1988, Roldán beat former world Middleweight champion Hugo Corro via first-round knockout in Mar del Plata, securing a third world title shot, against Michael Nunn on November 4 of that year. Roldán lost what turned out to be his last fight, by a knockout in round eight. Roldán retired with a record of 67 wins, 5 losses, 2 draws and one no contest, 47 of his wins being by knockout.

==Death==
Roldán died on November 18, 2020, from COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. He was 63.

<text>Kamloops ( ) is a city in south-central British Columbia, Canada, at the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers, which join to become the Thompson River in Kamloops, and east of Kamloops Lake. It is located in the Thompson-Nicola Regional District, whose district offices are based here. The surrounding region is sometimes referred to as the Thompson Country.

The city was incorporated in 1893 with about 500 residents. The Canadian Pacific Railway was completed through downtown in 1886, and the Canadian National arrived in 1912, making Kamloops an important transportation hub.

With a 2021 population of 97,902, it is the twelfth largest municipality in the province. The Kamloops census agglomeration is ranked 36th among census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada with a 2021 population of 114,142.

Kamloops is promoted as the &quot;Tournament Capital of Canada&quot;. It hosts more than 100 sporting tournaments each year (hockey, baseball, curling, etc) at sports facilities such as the Tournament Capital Centre, Kamloops Bike Ranch, and Tournament Capital Ranch. Logging, beef cattle, vegetable farming, transportation, viticulture, health care, tourism, and education are major contributing industries to the regional economy and have grown in recent years. Thompson Rivers University (~25,000 students) was established as Cariboo College in 1970.

== History ==


The first European explorers arrived in 1811. David Stuart, a trader sent from Fort Astoria, then still a Pacific Fur Company post, spent a winter with the Secwépemc people. In May of the following year, trader Alexander Ross established a post, which was known as &quot;Fort Cumcloups&quot;.

The rival North West Company established Fort Shuswap nearby in the same year. The two businesses merged in 1813 when the North West Company bought the operations of the Pacific Fur Company. In 1821, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company merged with the North West Company, and the post became known commonly as Thompson&#x27;s River Post, or Fort Thompson. Later it was known as Fort Kamloops. The post&#x27;s Chief Traders kept journals, which document a series of inter-Indian wars and personalities for the period, in addition to the daily business of the fur companies and their personnel along the entire Pacific Slope.

Soon after the forts were founded, Kwa&#x27;lila, chief of the main local village of the Secwépemc, moved his people closer to the trading post, so they could control access and gain in prestige and security. After Kwa&#x27;lila died, his nephew and foster son Nicola became chief. He later led an alliance of Syilx (Okanagan) and Nlaka&#x27;pamux peoples in the plateau country to the south around Stump, Nicola and Douglas lakes.

Relations between Nicola and the fur traders were often tense, but Chief Nicola was recognized for his aid to colonizers during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858. He did try to control those who had been in parties waging violence and looting on the Okanagan Trail, which led from American territory to the Fraser goldfields. Throughout, Kamloops was an important way station on the route of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Brigade Trail, which connected Fort Vancouver with Fort Alexandria and the other forts in New Caledonia to the north (today&#x27;s Omineca Country, roughly). It was integral during the onset of the Cariboo Gold Rush as the main route to the new goldfields around what was to become Barkerville.

The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic swept through the Kamloops area during the summer of that year, decimating the Secwepemc, Nlaka&#x27;pamux, and other indigenous peoples. They had no acquired immunity. The epidemic had started in Victoria and quickly spread throughout British Columbia, especially among First Nations. In June 1862, indigenous people went to Fort Kamloops seeking smallpox vaccine, William Manson, chief clerk at the fort, vaccinated numerous persons, but fatalities were extremely high. In late September he reported &quot;smallpox still raging amongst the Indians&quot;.

In October a newspaper in Victoria reported an eyewitness account from Fort Kamloops, saying

The Indians have been nearly exterminated at [Kamloops]: only sixteen have escaped out of a large settlement. Their bodies are strewing the ground in all directions.

About two-thirds of the Secwepemc died during the epidemic. In the aftermath, colonists took over traditional lands of the Secwepemc and many other indigenous groups throughout British Columbia.

The gold rush of the 1860s and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which reached Kamloops from the West in 1885, brought further growth. The City of Kamloops was incorporated in 1893 with a population of about 500.

In 1908 due to the Tuberculosis Pandemic a sanatorium was opened west of the city named King Edward Memorial Sanatorium, the sanatorium was later acquired by the provincial government in 1921, being renamed to Tranquille Sanatorium, it later closed in 1958. The Tranquille Institution reopened in 1959 to treat people with mental problems it later closed in 1983.

In 1967, Kamloops amalgamated with the Town of North Kamloops.

In 1973, Kamloops amalgamated with the Districts of Brocklehurst, Dufferin, the Town of Valleyview, and the Kamloops Indian Band, and the communities of Dallas, Campbell Creek, Barnhart Vale, Heffley Creek, Rayleigh, Westsyde and Knutsford. In 1976, the Kamloops Indian Band split from the City of Kamloops.

In May 2021, an anthropologist announced she had used ground-penetrating radar to find &quot;probable&quot; graves containing the remains of 215 children found at a former Kamloops Indian residential school, part of the Canadian Indian residential school system. The story was reported around the world, and five Catholic churches in Western Canada were burned down in the weeks following, since the school was operated by a Catholic order. However, this story cannot be completely confirmed until bodies are exhumed.

===Etymology===
&quot;Kamloops&quot; is the anglicized version of the Shuswap word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;meeting of the waters&quot;. Shuswap is still spoken in the area by members of the Tk&#x27;emlúps Indian Band.

An alternate origin sometimes given for the name may have come from the native name&#x27;s accidental similarity to the French &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Camp of Wolves&quot;; many early fur traders were ethnic French. There are folk stories about an attack on a traders&#x27; camp by a pack of wolves. Other legendary versions recount a huge white wolf, or a pack of wolves and other animals, that were moving overland from the Nicola Country and were repelled by a single shot by John Tod, then Chief Trader. This prevented the wolves from attacking the fort and earned Tod a great degree of respect locally.

==Geography==
Kamloops is in the Thompson Valley and the Montane Cordillera Ecozone. The city&#x27;s centre is in the valley near the confluence of the Thompson River&#x27;s north and south branches. Suburbs stretch for more than a dozen kilometres along the north and south branches, as well as to the steep hillsides along the south portion of the city and lower northeast hillsides.

Robert W. Service in 1904 described Kamloops as his delightful life and wrote &quot;Life was pleasant, and the work was light. At four o&#x27;clock we were on our horses, riding over the rolling ridges, or into spectral gulches that rose to ghostlier mountains. It was like the scenery of Mexico, weirdly desolate and aridly morose. A discouraging land, forbidding in its weariness and resigned to ruin.&quot;

Kamloops Indian Band areas begin just to the northeast of the downtown core but are not within the city limits. As a result of this placement, it is necessary to leave Kamloops&#x27; city limits and pass through the band lands before re-entering the city limits to access the northernmost communities of Rayleigh and Heffley Creek. Kamloops is surrounded by the smaller communities of Cherry Creek, Pritchard, Savona, Scotch Creek, Adams Lake, Chase, Paul Lake, Pinantan and various others.

===Climate===
The climate of Kamloops is semi-arid (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;) due to its rain shadow location. Kamloops gets short cold snaps where temperatures can drop to around or below when Arctic air manages to cross the Rockies and Columbia Mountains into the Interior.

Kamloops has the third mildest winter of any non-coastal city in Canada, after Penticton and Kelowna. The coldest months are December and January, when the mean temperatures are and . That average sharply increases with an average maximum temperature of in February. Between November and January the area experiences abundant cloud cover due to a continual series of Pacific coastal Low Pressure systems crossing British Columbia, reducing the annual sunshine output, despite very sunny summers.
The average number of days where the minimum temperatures drops below per year is 19 as recorded by Environment Canada.The average number of days where the Maximum temperature goes above is 36, above is 8 days. 
Although Kamloops is above 50° north latitude, growing seasons are long, with hot periods every summer under dry and sunny weather. Daytime humidity often drops below 20% during dry periods, which allows for substantial nighttime cooling. Occasional summer thunderstorms can create dry-lightning conditions, sometimes igniting forest fires which the area is prone to.

Kamloops lies in the rain shadow leeward of the Coast Mountains and is biogeographically connected to similar semi-desert areas in the Okanagan region, and a much larger area covering the central/eastern portions of Washington, Oregon and intermontane areas of Nevada, Utah and Idaho in the US.

These areas of relatively similar climate have many distinctive native plants and animals in common, such as ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;), big sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot;), prickly pear cactus (&quot;Opuntia fragilis&quot; in this case), rattlesnakes, black widow spiders and Lewis&#x27;s woodpecker.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Kamloops was on 29 June 2021, which was the fourth-highest reading recorded in Canada, and the highest recorded in any city, during the infamous 2021 Western North America heat wave. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 16 and 18 January 1950.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kamloops had a population of 97,902 living in 39,914 of its 41,619 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 90,280. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Kamloops CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Religious groups ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Kamloops included:

*irreligion (57,245; 60.5%)
*Christian (31,790; 33.6%)
*Sikh (2,005; 2.1%)
*Hindu (995; 1.1%)

=== Ethnicity ===

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.
==== Chinese Canadians ====

Kamloops historically had a Chinatown on Victoria Street where most ethnic Chinese lived. John Stewart of the Kamloops Museum and Archives stated it was not a &quot;true Chinatown&quot;. It was established by Chinese immigrants by 1887, and by 1890 the community had up to 400 Chinese. Stewart said this was an &quot;amazingly large&quot; population for the rural area. By the 1890s, about 33% of Kamloops were ethnic Chinese; they worked primarily on construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Economic changes in Kamloops resulted in many Chinese seeking work elsewhere. In addition, there were two fires in 1892 and 1893, and a 1911–1914 demolition that dismantled the Chinatown. Peter Wing, the first ethnic Chinese mayor in North America, was elected in 1966 and served three terms as the Mayor of Kamloops.

In the 1880s the Kamloops&#x27; Chinese Cemetery was founded in Kamloops, the only one in the province dedicated to Chinese pioneers. It is one of the largest cemeteries in the province, but the last interment was made there in the 1960s.

In 2013 the provincial government announced it would begin a consultation process to discuss wording of a formal apology to Chinese in B.C. for past wrongs. Joe Leong, president of the Kamloops Chinese Cultural Association, said he believed that the province should build a museum to honour Chinese history in the province, as a way to recognize the contributions of the people. As Kamloops had the only cemetery dedicated to the Chinese pioneers, he felt this city would be an appropriate site for the museum.

== Economy ==
Kamloops&#x27; economy includes healthcare, tourism, education, transportation, and natural resource extraction industries.

The Royal Inland Hospital (RIH) is the city&#x27;s largest employer. RIH is the region&#x27;s acute care and health facility and is one of two tertiary referral hospitals in the Southern Interior with 239 acute beds and an additional 20 more beds upon completion of the expansion in 2016.

Thompson Rivers University (TRU) serves a student body of 25,754 including a diverse international contingent mainly from Asian countries. Thompson Rivers University, Open Learning (TRU-OL) is the biggest distance education provider in British Columbia and one of the biggest in Canada.

Heavy industries in the Kamloops area include primary resource processing such as Domtar Kamloops Pulp Mill, Tolko-Heffley Creek Plywood and Veneer, New Gold Inc - New Afton Mine, and Highland Valley Copper Mine (in Logan Lake).

Four major highways join in Kamloops, the BC Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway), the Coquihalla Highway (BC highway 5 south of the city), the Yellowhead Highway (BC Highway 5 north of the city) and BC Highway 97, making it a transportation hub and a place which attracts business. There are over 50 trucking and transport companies located in Kamloops that ship across Canada and into the United States. Both the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway service Kamloops with both lines running through the city.

===Tourism===
Kamloops welcomed 1.8 million visitors in 2017, a 9% increase from 2015 (1.64 million).

Tourism&#x27;s economic ROI is immense. A$1.8 million destination marketing budget returned $449 million in economic benefit in 2017.The annual Direct Visitor Expenditure is estimated at $270 million, a 19% increase from 2015 ($227 million). Further, the total estimated tourism economic impact was $449 million in 2017, a 32.4% increase from 2015 ($339 million).

Tourism generates many types of income for the region, including business income, wage earnings, share earnings, rates and levies. Conservation springs from industry-wide support for management, research and education initiatives that benefit everyone through responsible tourism management.

Kamloops has over 50 accommodation choices from major hotels to bed and breakfasts. Accommodation occupancy rates were 61.5% in 2017, up 2.6% from 2016.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kashiwa has been increasing rapidly over the past 70 years.

==History==

===Early history===
Kashiwa has been settled since ancient times, and was historically part of Shimōsa Province. The area around Kashiwa was the site of the Battle of Sakainehara in 1478 early in the Sengoku period (1467 – 1573). During the Edo period (1603 – 1868), the area was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. The shogunate established a number of horse ranches which provided war horses for the army of the shogunate. The Tokugawa shogunate put much effort into draining the marshy areas of Lake Tega (Lake Teganuma) during the Edo period as part of large-scale land reclamation carried out across Japan. Kashiwa was developed as a post station on the Mito Kaidō, which connected the capitol at Edo with Mito in present-day Ibaraki Prefecture.

===Modern history===
After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Kashiwa Village was created in Chiba Prefecture on October 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Kashiwa was connected to Tokyo by rail in 1896, and rail construction during the Meiji period (1868 – 1912) established the area as a commercial center. Kashiwa became a town on September 15, 1926. Kashiwa, like much of northern Chiba Prefecture, saw the development of numerous military installations in the 1930s, notably after the Mukden Incident in 1931. The Imperial Japanese Army established Kashiwa Air Field and Kashiwa Military Hospital, and Kashiwa became a military town. The air field was abandoned after the end of World War II, but the hospital continues to exist as the Kashiwa Public Hospital.

On September 1, 1954, Kashiwa absorbed neighboring Kogane Town and Tsuchi and Tanaka villages to form the new city of . However, many politicians in Kogane Town were vehemently opposed to the merger, and forced its dissolution on October 15, 1954, with most of former Kogane Town merging with Matsudo city instead. On November 1, 1954, Fuse Village broke away from Tokatsu, eventually joining Abiko Town to form the city of Abiko. The remaining portion of Tokatsu was renamed Kashiwa on November 15, 1954. On December 25, 1955, a fire of unknown origin destroyed the former Kashiwa City Hall, and burned down most of the center of the city. In the 1960s, Kashiwa was designated for reconstruction with a special fund from the central government, which included Japan&#x27;s first pedestrian decks, completed at Kashiwa Station in 1973. Also during this period, new town developments greatly expanded the city&#x27;s population.

On April 1, 2008, Kashiwa was designated as a core city, with increased local autonomy. In August 2010, the city population exceeded 400,000 people.

==Government==
Kashiwa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 36 members. Kashiwa contributes five members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Chiba 8th district and the Chiba 13th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Kashiwa is a regional commercial center and a bedroom community for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. Due to its good transportation connection with Tokyo, an estimated 42.3% of the working population (2015 census) commute to Tokyo for work. The city has a mixed industrial base, with food processing industries forming an important portion of the economy.

<text>is a city located in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 211,620 in 89,751 households and a population density of 6,000 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==

===Climate===
Nagareyama has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Nagareyama is 14.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1370 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.6 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.0 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Nagareyama has seen strong growth from the 1950s to the present day. As Japan&#x27;s overall population reached its peak in the early 21st century, Nagareyama&#x27;s continued growth has been attributed to city policies from 2003 to heavily invest in childcare centers, including a transit service at Nagareyama-centralpark Station where parents can drop off their children on their way to work, with the children then shuttled with buses to daycare centers. Senior people of the local community help caring for the children. Many parents say this transit service was one of the biggest reasons for them to move to Nagareyama. There are also many local events and community spaces where children and elderly interact. There is also a summer camp which children can attend while their parents work during holidays.

From the Taisho period to the early Showa period, Abiko was sometimes called &quot;Kamakura in the north&quot; as many prominent cultural figures such as Naoya Shiga, Saneatsu Mushanokoji, Soetsu Yanagi, and Bernard Leach had villas in the town, which became a center for the Shirakabaha literary coterie. On November 1, 1954, it annexed neighboring Tomise village from the same district. On April 29, 1955, Abiko annexed Fusa Town and Kohoku Village. Abiko achieved city status on July 1, 1970. In 2003, a proposal to merge Abiko with neighboring city of Kashiwa and the town of Shōnan was defeated by a public referendum. Parts of the city were damaged by soil liquefaction due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

==Government==
Abiko has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 24 members. Abiko contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Chiba 8th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Although agriculture still plays a significant role in the local economy, Abiko is largely a regional commercial center and from the 1970s developed into a commuter town for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. The commuting rate is 32.3% for central Tokyo and 12.4% for Kashiwa City (both according to the 2010 census).

The city sustained injuries and fatalities during World War II via aerial bombing by the United States. The city was occupied by American forces after the war. Soon after, land reform and economic reform were carried out in Kamogawa. In 1958 the coastal areas of Kamogawa became a part of Minami Bōsō Quasi-National Park, and the town became a tourist destination as a result of the establishment of the park. Kamogawa was elevated to city status on March 31, 1971. On February 11, 2005, the town of Amatsukominato (from Awa District) was merged into Kamogawa.

==History==
The area around Kamagaya has been inhabited since prehistory, and archaeologists have found Jōmon period shell middens in the area. During the Kamakura period, the area was controlled by the Sōma clan. Kamagaya flourished in the Edo period 1603–1868 when the area was largely &quot;tenryō&quot; territory within Shimōsa Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. One part of present-day Kamagaya was part of the Kogane Ranch, which raised war horses for the army of the Tokugawa shogunate. In the Edo period Kamagaya was also a thriving &quot;shukuba&quot; post on the Kioroshi Road, which connected present-day Inzai on the Tone River to Edogawa-ku in Tokyo. The road was utilized to bring fresh fish and other marine products from the Tone River region to the capital Edo. After the Meiji Restoration, it became part of Chiba Prefecture. Kamagaya Village was one of several villages created on April 1, 1889 under Inba District with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. In 1945, the Imperial Japanese Army appropriated the former Musashino Country Club, turning the golf course into an air field. The base was turned over to the United States Air Force after World War II, becoming Shiroi Air Base, and was transferred to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force in 1959, becoming JMSDF Shimofusa Air Base. Kamagaya became a town on August 1, 1968, and was elevated to city status on September 1, 1971.

==Government==
Kamagaya has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 24 members. Kamagaya contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Chiba 13th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Kamagaya, formerly a farming area, is now a regional commercial center. Due to its numerous train connections it serves as a transportation hub and bedroom community for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. Kamagaya&#x27;s trademark produce is the round, Nashi Pear, and there are many pear orchards dotted about the city, whose white blossoms open toward the end of the cherry blossom season.

==Education==
Kamagaya has nine public elementary schools and five public middle schools operated by the city government, and two public high schools operated by the Chiba Prefectural Board of Education.

<text>is a city located in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 83,058 in 39,138 households and a population density of 260 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Overview==
The area along Tokyo Bay is in the Kimitsu district of Kisarazu Port, and it is a heavy industrial area centered around Nippon Steel (formerly Yahata Steel and Nippon Steel). The city area is mostly located along the coast around Kimitsu Station. In the inland Kururi area, the JR Kururi Line runs through, and it was a castle town of the Kururi Domain during the Edo period, with historical streets still remaining.

The underground water from the Kiyosumi and Mitsuishi mountain ranges was chosen as one of the &quot;Top 100 Famous Waters of Heisei&quot; and is called &quot;Living Water of Kururi.&quot; Kururi is the top producer in Japan of kallos (wetland plants) using the spring water.

In the late 1960s, about 20,000 people from Kyushu moved to the area when the Yahata Steel factory opened. This is known as the &quot;Great Migration,&quot; and Kyushu culture still remains in many parts of the region.

==Geography==
Kimitsu is located in the southwestern part of Chiba prefecture, about 35 kilometers from the prefectural capital at Chiba, and 40 to 50 kilometers from the center of Tokyo. The northwestern part of the city faces Tokyo Bay and forms a part of the expansive Keiyo Industrial Zone. The inland area is lined with mountains in the Bōsō hills. The city area is the second largest area in Chiba prefecture after Ichihara city. Two small rivers cross Kimitsu, the Koito River and the Obitsu River.

===Climate===
Kimitsu has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Kimitsu is . The average annual rainfall is with October as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kimitsu peaked around the year 2000 and has declined since.

==History==
The area of present-day Kimitsu was largely part of the Kururi Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, centered on the &quot;jōkamachi&quot; of Kururi Castle. It was divided between Moda District and Sue District in the early Meiji period cadastral reforms. Both districts became part of Kimitsu District from April 1, 1897. The village of Susaki and Yaehara were created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Kimitsu Town was founded by the merger of these villages on April 1, 1943, and expanded through annexation of two neighboring villages of Sunami and Sadamoto on April 1, 1944. The town continued to expand by annexing the towns of Kazusa and Koito and the villages of Seiwa and Obitsu on September 28, 1970. Kimitsu was elevated to city status on September 1, 1971. 

===About merger===
Before Kimitsu City was established, Kimitsu Town went through three mergers in 1943, 1954, and 1970. Except for the 1954 merger, which was based on the Town and Village Merger Promotion Law (known as the &quot;Great Merger of Showa&quot;), the other two mergers had no relation to national policies.

In 1943, when the first Kimitsu Town was formed, Japan was in the middle of World War II. The Yaehara Factory, a branch of the Kisarazu Naval Air Corps, was built on a large area of land across Yaehara Village and Susai Village. Because of this, there were issues like moving houses, buying farmland, and distributing food and clothes for workers. With help from the Japanese military, the two villages merged to create &quot;Kimitsu Town.&quot;

The 1970 merger was influenced by the Yahata Steel Factory (now Nippon Steel Kimitsu Works) that moved into the coastal area during the 1960s. The factory increased property tax income for Kimitsu Town. However, if the population was too small, part of the tax would go to Chiba Prefecture. To prevent this, the town merged with other nearby areas to increase the population. At first, Kisarazu City was also part of the merger talks, and a new city name, &quot;Kimitsu-Kisarazu City,&quot; was suggested. But since Kisarazu City did not agree, the plan was dropped. On September 28, 1970, five towns and villages merged, creating the new &quot;Kimitsu Town.&quot; After reaching the population requirements, Kimitsu Town became Kimitsu City on September 1, 1971, becoming the 25th city in Chiba Prefecture.
==Government==
Kimitsu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Kimitsu contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Chiba 12th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Despite its short coastline on Tokyo Bay, the economy of Kimitsu is centered around its coastal belt of heavy industries, primarily by the large-scale steelworks of Nippon Steel&#x27;s Kimitsu Works. Kimitsu Works was established in 1965, covers , and employed 3,280 people . The Koito Fishing Port, technically located in both Kimitsu and Futtsu, is located just north of Cape Futtsu at the mouth of the Koito River. Entry in and out of the fishing port suffers from sediment deposited by the Koito. Kazusa Akademia Park, which spans both Kimitsu and Kisarazu, was established to carry out research in biotechnology and information technology.

==Education==
Kimitsu has 17 public elementary schools and seven public middle schools operated by the city government, and three public high schools operated by the Chiba Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private middle school and one private high school. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

The area also is prominent in the Yamatotakeru mythology. Under the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system of the Nara period, the area became part of Amaha County and Sue County of Kazusa Province. Large scale &quot;shōen&quot; in the Heian period gave way to feudal samurai estates in the Kamakura period, with large portions controlled by the temple of Shomyo-ji in Mutsuura. The area was contested between the Takeda clan and Satomi clan during the Sengoku period. During the Edo period under the Tokugawa shogunate, most of the area was under the control of Sanuki Domain.

<text>Sherwood Park is a large hamlet in Alberta, Canada within Strathcona County that is recognized as an urban service area. It is located on traditional Treaty 6 territory, and adjacent to the City of Edmonton&#x27;s eastern boundary. While long confined to generally south of Highway 16 (Yellowhead Trail), west of Highway 21 and north of Highway 630 (Wye Road), portions of Sherwood Park have expanded beyond Yellowhead Trail and Wye Road since the start of the 21st century. Anthony Henday Drive (Highway 216) separates Refinery Row, in a portion of the Sherwood Park Urban Service Area to the west, from the residential and commercial hamlet to the east.

Sherwood Park was established in 1955 on farmland of the Smeltzer family, east of Edmonton. With a population of 75,575 in 2024, Sherwood Park has enough people to be Alberta&#x27;s sixth largest city, but it retains the status of a hamlet, though the Government of Alberta officially recognizes the Sherwood Park Urban Service Area as equivalent to a city.

== History ==
The area was first inhabited by Indigenous people, including the Cree. 

In 1881, settlers arrived and started setting up homesteads in the area just north of where Sherwood Park is today.

Sherwood Park was founded as Campbelltown by John Hook Campbell and John Mitchell in 1953 when the Municipal District of Strathcona No. 83 approved their proposed development of a bedroom community east of Edmonton. The first homes within the community were marketed to the public in 1955. Canada Post intervened on the name of Campbelltown due to the existence of several other communities in Canada with the same name, so the community&#x27;s name was changed to Sherwood Park in 1956.

<text>Sir Joseph Cook (7 December 1860 – 30 July 1947) was an Australian politician and trade unionist who served as the sixth prime minister of Australia from 1913 to 1914. He held office as the leader of the Liberal Party, having previously been leader of the Anti-Socialist Party from 1908 to 1909. His victory at the 1913 election marked the first time that a centre-right party had won a majority at an Australian federal election.

Cook was born in Silverdale, Staffordshire, England, and began working in the local coal mines at the age of nine. He emigrated to Australia in 1885, settling in Lithgow, New South Wales. He continued to work as a miner, becoming involved with the local labour movement as a union official. In 1891, Cook was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as a representative of the Labor Party, becoming one of its first members of parliament. He was elected party leader in 1893, but the following year left Labor due to a disagreement over party discipline. He was then invited to become a government minister under George Reid, and joined Reid&#x27;s Free Trade Party.

In 1901, Cook was elected to the new Federal Parliament representing the Division of Parramatta. He became deputy leader of the federal Free Trade Party (later renamed the Anti-Socialist Party), again under George Reid, and in 1908 replaced Reid as party leader and Leader of the Opposition. In what became known as &quot;the fusion&quot;, Cook agreed to merge his party with Alfred Deakin&#x27;s Protectionist Party in 1909, forming a unified anti-Labor party for the first time. He became deputy leader of the new Liberal Party, allowing Deakin to become prime minister again, and was Minister for Defence until the government&#x27;s defeat at the 1910 election.

Cook replaced Deakin as leader of the Liberals in January 1913, and a few months later won a one-seat majority over Andrew Fisher&#x27;s Labor Party at the 1913 election. His party failed to secure a majority in the Australian Senate, making governing difficult, and as a result he engineered the first double dissolution. A new election was called for September 1914, at which the Liberals lost their majority; Fisher returned as prime minister. Cook was unable to pass much legislation during his time in office, but did oversee the early stages of Australia&#x27;s involvement in World War I. He subsequently became Leader of the Opposition for a third time.

In 1917, Cook was involved in a second party merger, joining the Liberals with Billy Hughes&#x27;s National Labor Party to form the Nationalist Party. He became the &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister under Hughes, serving as Minister for the Navy (1917–1920) and Treasurer (1920–1921). He was a delegate to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, where he was a member of the committee that determined the borders of Czechoslovakia, and along with Hughes was one of two Australians to sign the Treaty of Versailles. After leaving politics, Cook was High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1921 to 1927. He died at the age of 86 as one of the last survivors of the first federal parliament.

==Early years==

Cook was born on 7 December 1860 in a small cottage in Silverdale, Staffordshire, England. He was the second of seven children born to Margaret (née Fletcher) and William Cooke. His older sister Sarah died in 1865, but his three younger sisters and two younger brothers lived to adulthood. Cook&#x27;s parents moved to a a few months after his birth, before eventually settling in a terraced house on Newcastle Street. The children shared a single room and two beds, and the family could rarely afford meat. Cook&#x27;s father was a coal miner under the system at the nearby Hollywood pit. He was killed in a mining accident in April 1873, forcing his oldest son to become the family&#x27;s primary source of income.

Cook&#x27;s only formal education was at the school attached to St Luke&#x27;s, the local Anglican church. He left school and began working in the coal mines at the age of nine, earning one shilling per day for ten to twelve hours of work. Beginning at four o&#x27;clock in the morning, his tasks were to attend to the horses and clean and oil the mining equipment. After the passage of the &quot;Elementary Education Act 1870&quot;, Cook was allowed to return to school until he reached the legal leaving age. He left school a second time after his father&#x27;s death and returned to his former employment at the local colliery. However, as a result of his teacher&#x27;s attention, together with that of his parents, an exceptionally strong ambition to improve his position became implanted in him. This ambition was to become one of his most prominent characteristics, revealed first in a drive for self-improvement and, later on in life, his determination to succeed in politics. During his teenage years, he embraced Primitive Methodism, and marked his conversion by dropping the &quot;e&quot; from his surname. On 8 August 1885, he married Mary Turner at Wolstanton, Staffordshire, and the couple eventually had five sons and three daughters.

Shortly after their marriage, the couple emigrated to New South Wales and settled in Lithgow, joining Cook&#x27;s brother-in-law and a number of other former miners from Silverdale. Cook worked in the coal mines, becoming General-Secretary of the Western Miners Association in 1887. In 1888, he participated in demonstrations against Chinese immigration. He was also active in the Land Nationalisation League, which was influenced by the ideas of Henry George and strongly supported free trade, and was a founding member of the Labor Party in 1891.

==Early political career==

Cook was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as MP for the coalfields seat of Hartley in 1891, in Labor&#x27;s first big breakthrough in Australian politics. It was the first time Labor had won a seat in any parliament in Australia.

In 1894, however, Cook was the leader of those parliamentarians who refused to accept the Labor Party&#x27;s decision to make all members sign a &quot;pledge&quot; to be bound by decisions of the Parliamentary Labor Party (Caucus). Cook&#x27;s protest was based on Labor&#x27;s attitude to the tariff question in particular, with his preference for free trade being increasingly at odds with his party. It was also based on his religious beliefs, which valued independence of conscience as a necessary moral imperative. By the end of the year, he had become a follower of George Reid&#x27;s Free Trade Party, and for years afterwards he was seen as a &#x27;class traitor&#x27; by Labor. Cook for his part maintained that the original Labor Party of 1891 was an entirely separate entity from the pledged party, hence that he had never been a member of what became the Labor Party. He became an invaluable ally of Reid, despite the fact that the two men had distinctly different characters, and remained colleagues only at a distance.

Cook was appointed Postmaster-General of New South Wales when Reid formed a government in August 1894. He chaired two intercolonial post and telegraph (P&amp;T) conferences in 1896, at which the Australian colonies agreed to fund a Pacific Cable linking Australia to North America. In opening the first conference, he spoke of the &quot;federal spirit [...] animating most of our Australasian national endeavours at the present time&quot;. It was eventually resolved that the colonies would contribute equally to funding the cable rather than on a simple per-capita basis, an agreement which &quot;marked a turning point in the achievement of &#x27;practical Federation&#x27;&quot; and foreshadowed the development of a Senate with equal representation for each state. According to Kevin Livingston, who wrote a history of pre-Federation telecommunications in Australia, he &quot;deserves to be recognised as having played an influential, mediating role in leading the Australian colonies towards technological federalism in the mid-1890s&quot;.

==Federal Parliament==

Despite supporting federation in principle, Cook campaigned for a no vote at the first referendum on federation in 1898. He believed that a Senate which gave equal representation to each state regardless of population was undemocratic, and he was also a strong believer in the liberal concept of subsidiarity, the idea that political decisions are best made at the most local level. For the same reason, he would strongly oppose the 1911 and 1913 referendums seeking to enlarge the powers of the federal government.

Cook initially had no plans to enter federal politics, hoping instead to succeed Reid as premier of New South Wales. However, the party wanted a high-profile candidate to stand against William Sandford in the Division of Parramatta, a large electorate spanning from Parramatta on the outskirts of Sydney across the Blue Mountains to Lithgow. Reid offered the position of Postmaster-General in a future government as an inducement, but Cook did not agree to stand until a few weeks before the election. He was elected with a substantial majority, following a bitter campaign in which he accused Sandford of adopting political positions for self-benefit. The Free Traders failed to win government from the Protectionists, with Reid becoming Leader of the Opposition.

In the first term of federal parliament, Cook developed a reputation as a master of parliamentary procedure and tactics, &quot;always ready to speak, as often and as long as required&quot;. He spoke in favour of nationalising the iron industry and introducing compulsory conciliation and arbitration, views in line with his previous political affiliation. Opposing tariffs because they increased the price of goods needed for working families, in 1902 he would suggest that &quot;no man ought be in the position of Minister for Trade and Customs unless he had at least ten children&quot;. In June 1901 he moved from Lithgow to a larger house in Marrickville, in Sydney&#x27;s Inner West. Cook was re-elected with an increased majority at the 1903 election. He stood for the deputy leadership of the opposition when parliament resumed, but was defeated by Dugald Thomson, and was overlooked for ministerial office when Reid formed a government in August 1904. This was arguably because he had suffered a severe bout of illness that had kept him absent from Parliament for two months.

By 1904, Cook had become stridently anti-socialist, in line with Reid&#x27;s decision to reposition the Free Traders as the party of anti-socialism. Some of his previous political positions were abandoned, possibly to gain the trust of party colleagues who had been suspicious of his links with the labour movement. He instead came to espouse liberalism, regarding its views about personal freedom as closely aligned with Methodism&#x27;s understanding of the role of the individual in developing morality. He believed that his own story proved that Australia was a land of great social mobility, and that the nation should continue to support individual opportunity rather than risking a socialist revolution in which the state would be empowered to control individuals. In 1905 he accepted the position of deputy chairman of the Australian Liberal League, an organisation formed to support the anti-socialists in the lead-up to the next election.

During the Reid government, Cook filled a role similar to the later position of Leader of the House, assisting Reid with parliamentary tactics without being burdened by a ministerial portfolio. Reid had hoped to call an early election and entrusted Cook with organising the anti-socialist campaign. However, in June 1905 Protectionist leader Alfred Deakin withdrew his support from the government and formed a new administration, with Labor support.

Cook was unanimously elected deputy leader of the Anti-Socialists on 28 July 1905, following Thomson&#x27;s resignation. He &quot;started a political vendetta against Deakin&quot;, which &quot;perfectly suited the mood of the party&quot;. The Anti-Socialists ran a negative campaign with few policy specifics at the 1906 election, and the Protectionist–ALP alliance continued. He was re-elected unopposed, following a redistribution which saw Parramatta lose much of its working-class areas. In 1908 he moved to Baulkham Hills.

When Reid resigned as party leader on 16 November 1908, Cook succeeded him the following day, and agreed to merge the Anti-Socialist Party (the Free Trade Party had been renamed prior to the 1906 federal election) with Alfred Deakin&#x27;s Protectionists, in an effort to counter Labor&#x27;s popularity. Cook became deputy leader of the new &quot;Commonwealth Liberal Party&quot;, also known as &quot;the Fusion.&quot; Cook was Defence Minister in Deakin&#x27;s 1909–1910 ministry, then succeeded Deakin as Liberal leader when the government was defeated by Labor in the 1910 elections. Cook had, by this time, become completely philosophically opposed to socialism.

==Prime minister==
At the 1913 election, Cook championed private enterprise and attacked Labor&#x27;s &quot;socialist objective&quot; as the &quot;principle that the state must become more 
and more omnipotent, until it eventually takes over all the 
actions of the individual, shaping and determining all our 
production, distribution and exchange&quot;. The Commonwealth Liberal Party led by Cook won a one-seat majority in the House of Representatives over the Labor Party, led by Andrew Fisher, and defeated its 6 referendum proposals.

Cook thus became the sixth Prime Minister of Australia. However, Labor still had a majority in the Senate. Unable to govern effectively due to the hostile Senate, Cook decided to trigger a double dissolution under section 57 of the Constitution of Australia, the first time that provision had been used. He introduced a bill abolishing preferential employment for trade union members in the public service. As expected, the Senate rejected the bill, giving Cook an excuse to seek a double dissolution. World War I broke out in the middle of the resulting campaign for the September 1914 election. Andrew Fisher was able to remind voters that it was Labor that had favoured an independent Australian defence force, which the conservatives had opposed. Cook was also greatly hindered by the fact that he had to cut short his campaign to focus on war matters, at a time when there were few alternatives to in-person political rallies. Cook was defeated after a five-seat swing, and Fisher&#x27;s Labor Party resumed office.

===World War I===

Cook was prime minister for the first six weeks of Australia&#x27;s involvement in World War I. On 30 July 1914, he was informed via telegram that the British government was considering a declaration of war and advised that Australia should take appropriate defence precautions. He told an election meeting at Horsham, Victoria, the following day to &quot;remember that when the Empire is at war, so is Australia at war&quot;. At the suggestion of Governor-General Ronald Munro Ferguson, Cook called an emergency cabinet meeting for 3 August. It was attended by only four members of his ministry, as the others were out campaigning and unable to travel to Melbourne in time. The government decided to offer an expeditionary force of 20,000 men – &quot;of any suggested composition to any destination desired [...] at complete disposal of the Home Government; cost of despatch and
maintenance would be borne by this Government&quot; – and to give the British Admiralty control of the Royal Australian Navy &quot;when desired&quot;. Australia&#x27;s offer was made 40 hours before the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, and it has been suggested that it may have intensified the pressure on the British government to enter the war, along with similar offers made by Canada and New Zealand. The United Kingdom formally accepted Australia&#x27;s offer on 6 August, and Cook subsequently authorised the creation of the Australian Imperial Force and the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force; the latter captured and then occupied German New Guinea within a few months. Writing in 1962, Malcolm Henry Ellis described him as &quot;the activator and originator of Australia&#x27;s war effort&quot;.
Cook would have three sons serve in the AIF during the war, one of whom was twice wounded at Gallipoli but miraculously survived.

==Hughes government==
After Fisher resigned from parliament in 1915, Billy Hughes became Labor leader and prime minister. In 1916, Hughes began a determined push for the introduction of conscription for military service, causing a split in the Labor Party over the issue. However, Hughes was able to stay in office after getting parliamentary support from Cook and his party. Cook was initially reluctant to support conscription as it violated his longstanding opposition to compulsion, but eventually he concluded that “manhood suffrage denoted manhood responsibility”. Later in 1916, the so-called National Labor Party, consisting of those Labor members who supported Hughes, merged with the Commonwealth Liberals to form the Nationalist Party, as Cook decided to sacrifice his party&#x27;s liberal identity and philosophy in the name of winning the war at any cost. A Federal Liberal Party would not re-emerge until 1944. Although it was dominated by former Liberals, Hughes was named the new party&#x27;s leader, with Cook as deputy leader. Cook became Minister for the Navy and &quot;de facto&quot; deputy prime minister in Hughes&#x27; reconfigured government. The Nationalists had substantial victories over Labor in the 1917 election and the 1919 election.

Although Cook was a loyal deputy to Hughes, &quot;at no time did he develop any personal affection for him&quot;. He thought Hughes was autocratic and prone to taking credit for things that others had accomplished. He did however admire Hughes&#x27; strong leadership and &quot;immense energy&quot;, which contrasted with his own cautiousness. Cook was acting prime minister on a number of occasions when Hughes was overworked or on visits abroad. In parliament, he was effectively the Leader of the House (a title which did not yet exist), responsible for the passage of government business. He campaigned strongly for the &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the second conscription plebiscite in 1917, touring three states and giving multiple speeches each day. The &quot;No&quot; vote won, and Hughes fulfilled his earlier promise to resign as prime minister, although he remained in office as a caretaker. In determining who should be prime minister, Governor-General Ronald Munro Ferguson spoke first with Opposition Leader Frank Tudor, who declined to form a government, and then with senior members of the Nationalist Party. Cook&#x27;s advice that &quot;only Hughes&quot; was suitable proved decisive in Munro Ferguson recommissioning him as prime minister, rather than another Nationalist like John Forrest.

===Overseas activities===

Cook and Hughes represented Australia at the 1918 Imperial War Conference in London. They left together on 26 April 1918, with William Watt as acting prime minister in their absence. Cook participated in all fifteen sessions of the conference, but found that the most important work was being undertaken by Hughes behind closed doors; he was generally not consulted. After the conference concluded he paid an extended visit to the Western Front, accompanied by his adviser John Latham, author Arthur Conan Doyle, and war correspondent Charles Bean. They were taken within of the Hindenburg Line, near Bullecourt, and at one point a shell exploded less than a minute before they arrived at a meeting point. Cook visited Australian Army camps in South England and toured the British dockyards, consulting with Admiral John Jellicoe about the future of the Royal Australian Navy. He also visited his home town of Silverdale for the first time since he left England in 1886, and paid another visit to celebrate the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

Cook was one of the Australian delegates at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, which was led by Hughes. Although Australia and the other Dominions signed the Treaty of Versailles separately and became individual members of the League of Nations, for the preceding negotiations their representatives (and those of the United Kingdom) were considered to form one single British Empire delegation. Cook was chosen as the lead British delegate on the Commission on Czechoslovak Affairs, which was tasked with determining the final borders of Czechoslovakia. He was hampered by his lack of knowledge of European geography and inability to speak French, the contemporary language of diplomacy. According to Charles Seymour, one of the American delegates, he was &quot;blissfully ignorant of everything European and practically every word of our discussion was Greek to him&quot;. Harold Nicolson, the other British delegate, said that he assumed an attitude of &quot;benevolent boredom&quot; during meetings. Cook was generally in favour of an enlarged Czechoslovakia, believing that the lands of the Sudeten Germans had to be included in Czechoslovakia for security reasons. He and Nicolson had a difference of opinion over Great Schütt, but French delegation was in agreement with Cook and the island was awarded to Czechoslovakia.

The Treaty of Versailles was signed on 23 June 1919 with Cook and Hughes signing on behalf of Australia. Cook had some private misgivings about the final document. Although he believed Germany needed to be punished, he thought some elements of the treaty were too vindictive. He was strongly in favour of the creation of the League of Nations, and David Lloyd George considered him to be the most fervent supporter of the League in the entire British delegation. Lloyd George considered him &quot;a man of calm and balanced judgment&quot;. Cook and Hughes arrived back in Australia on 24 August 1919, after an absence of nearly 16 months. They travelled from Fremantle to Melbourne via the Trans-Australian Railway, and Cook particularly enjoyed their stop at the small settlement of Cook, South Australia, which had been named in his honour a few years earlier. Hughes was feted upon his return, but Cook did not receive similar adulation and returned to Sydney relatively quietly. An early election was called to capitalise on the prime minister&#x27;s popularity, which saw the Nationalists win re-election with a reduced majority.

===Treasurer===

In March 1920, Cook was appointed Acting Treasurer in the absence of William Watt, who was attending a conference in London. Watt resigned by cable in June after falling out with Hughes. The position of Treasurer was initially offered to Stanley Bruce, who declined it, and then to Cook, who reluctantly accepted. He took office at the height of the post-war boom and was faced with high inflation, but also high unemployment as the economy attempted to absorb returned soldiers. Cook was a fiscal conservative by nature, preferring to limit government spending and keep taxes low. He brought down two budgets during his tenure, for the 1920–21 and 1921–22 financial years; both were primarily concerned with reducing inflation. He was twice faced with significant revenue shortfalls, which he chose to fill primarily with overseas loans and only a small increase in taxation. He found both options distasteful, but preferred lower taxes – the opposite approach to that taken by Canada, which faced a similar situation.

Cook has been viewed as an orthodox but unimaginative treasurer whose conservatism with regard to government spending may have been unsuited to the needs of post-war reconstruction. One notable initiative of his was the transfer of responsibility for issuing banknotes from the Treasury Department to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The bank&#x27;s governor Denison Miller regarded this as &quot;the first and most important step in the enlargement [of the Commonwealth Bank] into a national bank in every sense of the word&quot;. Cook&#x27;s final months in parliament were spent as acting prime minister, as Hughes was out of the country for five months attending the 1921 Imperial Conference in London. In November 1921, it was announced that he would be appointed as Australia&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in place of Andrew Fisher, whose term had ended earlier that year.

==High Commissioner to the United Kingdom==
Cook arrived in London on 13 January 1922, where career diplomat Malcolm Shepherd had been &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; for a year. His primary duties were to promote immigration, investment, and trade, as well as to assist in securing favourable loans for the state and federal governments. He played a key role in organising the Australian pavilion at the British Empire Exhibition of 1924. Cook represented Australia at the International Labour Conferences and the 1922 Genoa Conference, but did &quot;little more than attend and subsequently report to his government&quot;. He was a more active participant at the League of Nations, where he was Australia&#x27;s chief delegate. He appeared before the Permanent Mandates Commission on a number of occasions to answer questions about the administration of its League of Nations mandates, Nauru and New Guinea. Cook overhauled the administration of Australia House, significantly reducing the number of staff and the annual running costs. This brought him into conflict with Shepherd, his official secretary, who complained that he was &quot;not an easy man to get on with&quot;.

Cook particularly enjoyed the social and ceremonial aspects of his new position. His first major engagement as High Commissioner was to represent Australia at the wedding of Princess Mary, and he also attended the wedding of the future George VI and Queen Elizabeth and the funeral of Queen Alexandra. He hosted regular social functions at Australia House, and mixed more easily in high society than his predecessor, whose partial deafness tended to make him withdrawn. Observers noted his &quot;bonhomie and accessibility&quot; in comparison to the &quot;asperity and seclusiveness of Mr Fisher&quot;. Cook&#x27;s term as High Commissioner formally concluded on 10 August 1927, after a six-month extension from the original five-year term. Leaving England ten days later, he and his wife were serenaded at the Port of Tilbury by the Australian opera singer Nellie Melba, who had become a close friend of theirs. John Cockburn wrote that &quot;rarely has the retirement of one of the representatives in London of the Dominions been attended with such widespread expressions of regret&quot;.

==Final years and death==

Unlike his predecessors Reid and Fisher, Cook did not settle in London permanently after the end of his term as High Commissioner. He arrived back in Sydney in September 1927 and bought a large house in Bellevue Hill, overlooking Sydney Harbour. In 1930, he demolished the house and built a luxury apartment block called &quot;Silchester&quot;, designed by Leslie Wilkinson. He and his wife retired to one flat and lived on the income from the others. In 1928, Cook was appointed chairman of a royal commission into &quot;the finances of South Australia, as affected by Federation&quot;. His co-commissioner Herbert Brookes wrote that &quot;it has been a joy to be associated with you again, even though you have had it all your own way&quot;. The commission&#x27;s report, handed down in 1929, found that South Australia had been disadvantaged by federal government policies that favoured New South Wales and Victoria, and should be compensated as a result. The report later became one of several documents used to justify the creation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the expansion of federal grants to state governments.

Cook enjoyed a low-profile retirement, with &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot; observing in 1936 that no other high-ranking politician had &quot;staged such a swiftly effective fade-out from the public view on retirement from the hurly-burly&quot;. He was interviewed during the Sudeten Crisis and after the German invasion of Poland, on both occasions defending the Treaty of Versailles and blaming German aggression for the new war. Cook ignored requests to write his memoirs, and in fact destroyed many of his personal papers; this would later present difficulties for his biographers. His final public-speaking engagement was at a church function in July 1940, where he warned against authoritarianism and told the audience to &quot;beware of those people who want to establish a new world order [...] the old things of the world today are the wisest and best things I know&quot;.

Cook died at his home in Bellevue Hill on 30 July 1947, after a heart-related illness of about three weeks. He was granted a state funeral, held at the Wesley Chapel on Castlereagh Street, and then cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. Pallbearers included Billy Hughes and Willie Kelly, the latter being the last surviving member of his ministry. Cook died at the age of 86, surpassing George Reid as Australia&#x27;s longest-lived prime minister; his record was broken by Hughes a few years later. He was the oldest living prime minister for a record span of over 27 years, following the death of Edmund Barton in 1920.

==Honours==

Cook was appointed to the Privy Council on 16 July 1914. He was knighted in 1918 as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

In 1972, he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.

Until 2024, the federal seat of Cook was originally only named after Captain James Cook and not Joseph Cook. This meant that Joseph Cook was the only (eligible) Prime Minister who did not have a federal electorate named after him. In 2006, the Australian Electoral Commission&#x27;s Redistribution Committee for New South Wales proposed that the division be jointly named for Joseph and James Cook, but this did not eventuate at the time. In 2024, the namesake was finally altered to be joint between both men, to give recognition to Joseph Cook and have a division named after him.

The suburb of Cook, located within the Belconnen district of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory is jointly named after Joseph and Captain James Cook.

<text>James Corbitt Morris (June 20, 1907 – July 12, 1998), known professionally as Jimmy Driftwood or Jimmie Driftwood, was an American folk-style songwriter and musician, most famous for his songs &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot; and &quot;Tennessee Stud&quot;. Driftwood wrote more than 6,000 folk songs, of which more than 300 were recorded by various musicians.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Driftwood was born in Timbo, Arkansas, United States on June 20, 1907. His father was folk singer Neal Morris. He is on the album Songs of the Ozarks. Driftwood learned to play the guitar at a young age on his grandfather&#x27;s homemade instrument. Driftwood used that unique guitar throughout his career and noted that its neck was made from a fence rail, its sides from an old ox yoke, and the head and bottom from the headboard of his grandmother&#x27;s bed. This homemade instrument produced a pleasant, distinctive, resonant sound.

Driftwood attended John Brown College in northwest Arkansas and later received a degree in education from Arkansas State Teacher&#x27;s College. He started writing songs during his teaching career to teach his students history in an entertaining manner.

===1920s and 1930s===
During the 1920s and 1930s, Driftwood left Arkansas, eventually hitchhiking through the southwestern United States. In Arizona he entered, and won, a local song contest.

In 1936, Driftwood married Cleda Johnson, who was one of his former students, and returned to Arkansas to raise a family and resume his teaching career. During this period of his life Driftwood wrote hundreds of songs but did not pursue a musical career seriously.

He wrote his later famous &quot;Battle of New Orleans&quot; in 1936, to help a high school class he was teaching become interested in the event.

===1950s===
In the 1950s, he changed his name to Jimmy Driftwood, both publicly and legally.

In 1957, a Nashville, Tennessee song publisher learned of Driftwood, auditioned him, and signed him to his first record deal. Driftwood recalled playing some 100 of his songs in one day, of which 20 were chosen to be recorded. Driftwood&#x27;s first album, &quot;Newly Discovered Early American Folk Songs&quot;, received good reviews but did not sell particularly well.

&quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot; was included on the album, but did not conform to the radio standards of the time because of the words &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;damn&quot; in the lyrics. Driftwood said that at the time those words could be preached but not sung in secular contexts for broadcast. Driftwood was asked to make a shorter censored version of the song for a live radio performance. Singer Johnny Horton, after hearing the song, contacted Driftwood and told him that he wished to record his own version.

Driftwood left Arkansas for Nashville and became popular by his appearances on programs including the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;, and &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;. He was invited to sing for Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as an example of traditional American music during the leader&#x27;s 1959 state visit to the United States. He became a member of the Opry in the 1950s.

The popular peak of Driftwood&#x27;s career came in 1959, when he had no fewer than six songs on the popular and country music charts, including Johnny Horton&#x27;s recording of his &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot;, which remained in first place on the country music singles chart for ten weeks, and atop the popular music chart for six weeks that year. The song won the 1959 Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

After Horton&#x27;s success, Driftwood performed at Carnegie Hall and at major American folk music festivals before returning home to Timbo, Arkansas in 1962. During his recording career Driftwood also won Grammy Awards for &quot;Wilderness Road&quot;, &quot;Songs of Billy Yank and Johnny Reb&quot; and &quot;Tennessee Stud&quot;. Driftwood songs were recorded by Eddy Arnold, Johnny Cash, Hawkshaw Hawkins, Homer and Jethro (the parody &quot;The Battle of Kookamonga&quot;), Odetta, Doc Watson and others. In 1959, Driftwood appeared as a guest on the television game show, &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;.

===1960s===
For a time during the 1960s, Driftwood toured the United States and Europe with the Preservation Hall New Orleans jazz band, although as a separate act. Back home, he became a folklorist, establishing the Rackensack Folklore Society, an association of local folk singers and musicians, and began performing at the local county fair in Mountain View. Driftwood became interested in promoting Arkansas folk music and the local folk performers he knew in the area. He invited members of the Mountain View community to perform at a festival of his own devising. First held on April 19 and 20 of 1963, this festival grew over the years, and transformed into the annual Arkansas Folk Festival which would attract more than 100,000 people.

Driftwood helped establish the Ozark Folk Center to preserve Ozark Mountain culture. The Folk Center was later absorbed into the Arkansas State Park system and remains a popular tourist destination.

===Environmental advocate===
Driftwood became involved with environmental issues when the United States Army Corps of Engineers planned to dam the Buffalo River. He worked to defeat the plan, which ultimately resulted in the establishment of Buffalo National River. Driftwood had a major role in preserving Blanchard Springs Caverns which later came under management of the United States Forest Service. He recorded the song still heard in the orientation film in the visitor center.

Driftwood was appointed to direct the Arkansas Parks and Tourism Commission for his environmental efforts. He was also named to the Advisory Committee of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.. Due to his extensive knowledge of folk music he was appointed as a musicologist for the National Geographic Society.

===Later years===
During his later life Driftwood enjoyed performing free concerts for high school and college students. He died of a heart attack on July 12, 1998, in Fayetteville, Arkansas, at age 91.

<text>Harold Smith Prince (born Harold Smith; January 30, 1928 – July 31, 2019), commonly known as Hal Prince, was an American theatre director and producer known for his work in musical theatre.

One of the foremost figures in 20th-century American theatre, Prince became associated throughout his career with many of the most noteworthy musicals in Broadway history, including &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;, the longest-running show in Broadway history. Many of his productions broke new ground for musical theater, expanding the possibilities of the form by incorporating more serious and political subjects, such as Nazism (&quot;Cabaret&quot;), the difficulties of marriage (&quot;Company&quot;), and the forcible opening of 19th-century Japan (&quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;).

Over the span of his career, he garnered 21 Tony Awards, including eight for directing, eight for producing the year&#x27;s Best Musical, two as Best Producer of a Musical, and three special awards.

==Early life==
Prince was born to an affluent family in Manhattan, the son of Blanche ( Stern) and Harold Smith. His family was of German Jewish descent. He was adopted by his stepfather, Milton A. Prince, a stockbroker. Following his graduation from the Franklin School, later called the Dwight School, in New York, he entered the University of Pennsylvania, where he followed a liberal arts curriculum and graduated in three years at age 19. He later served two years with the United States Army in post–World War II Germany.

==Career==
Prince began work in the theatre as an assistant stage manager to theatrical producer and director George Abbott. Along with Abbott, he co-produced &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, which won the 1955 Tony Award for Best Musical. He received Tony Awards for 1956&#x27;s &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, 1960&#x27;s &quot;Fiorello!&quot; and 1963&#x27;s &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, and Tony nominations for 1958&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;New Girl in Town&quot;. He went on to direct and produce his own productions in 1962 beginning with the unsuccessful &quot;A Family Affair&quot; followed by his first critically successful musical, &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (Tony nomination, 1964).

He received a Tony Award for producing &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1965) and almost gave up musical theatre before his Tony winning success directing and producing with Kander and Ebb&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot; in 1966, followed by Kander and Ebb&#x27;s &quot;Zorba&quot; (Tony nomination, 1969). 1970 marked the start of his greatest creative collaboration, with composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim. They had previously worked on &quot;West Side Story&quot; and their association spawned a long string of landmark productions, including &quot;Company&quot; (Tony Award, 1970), &quot;Follies&quot; (Tony Award, 1971), &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (Tony Award, 1973), &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; (Tony nomination, 1976), &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot; (Tony nomination, 1977), and &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (Tony Award, 1979). Following &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; (1981), which ran for 16 performances, they parted ways until &quot;Bounce&quot; in 2003.

He received a Tony nomination for directing &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; (1978) and won twice for the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals &quot;Evita&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1988). Between them, Prince was offered the job of directing &quot;Cats&quot; by Lloyd Webber but turned it down and directed &quot;A Doll&#x27;s Life&quot; (1982) with lyricists Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The musical continued the story of Nora Helmer past what Henrik Ibsen had written in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. It ran for five performances; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It was overproduced and overpopulated to the extent that the tiny resolute figure of Nora became lost in the combined mechanics of Broadway and the Industrial Revolution.&quot; Broadway wags dubbed the show either &quot;A Doll&#x27;s Death&quot; or, due to the omnipresent portal out of which Nora slammed in the prologue, &quot;A Door&#x27;s Life.&quot;
Prince&#x27;s other commercially unsuccessful musicals included &quot;Grind&quot; (Tony nomination, 1985), which closed after 71 performances, and &quot;Roza&quot; (1987). However, his production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; eventually became the longest-running show in Broadway history. Prince ultimately stopped producing because he &quot;became more interested in directing&quot;. &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, which he directed in 1993, received the Tony Award for Best Musical. In 1994, Prince became a Kennedy Center Honoree. He received a 1995 Tony Award for directing &quot;Showboat,&quot; and was nominated again for 1999&#x27;s &quot;Parade&quot;.

In 2000, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 2006, Prince was awarded a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre. In 2007, he directed his last original musical on Broadway, &quot;LoveMusik&quot;, and on May 20 of that year, he gave the commencement address at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He was presented with the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award by awards council member and author Toni Morrison at a 2007 ceremony in Washington, D.C. In 2008 Prince was the keynote speaker at Elon University&#x27;s Convocation for Honors celebration.

Prince co-directed, with Susan Stroman, the 2010 musical &quot;Paradise Found&quot;. The musical features the music of Johann Strauss II as adapted by Jonathan Tunick with lyrics by Ellen Fitzhugh. The book was written by Richard Nelson, based on Joseph Roth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tale of the 1002nd Night&quot;. The musical premiered at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London on May 19, 2010 and closed on June 26, and starred Mandy Patinkin.

A retrospective of Prince&#x27;s work titled &quot;Prince of Broadway&quot; was co-directed by Prince and Susan Stroman and presented by Umeda Arts Theater in Tokyo, Japan in October 2015. The book was written by David Thompson with additional material and orchestrations by Jason Robert Brown. Prince was slated to direct &quot;The Band&#x27;s Visit&quot; in 2016 but withdrew due to scheduling conflicts. &quot;Prince of Broadway&quot; opened in August 2017 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre in New York with a cast featuring Chuck Cooper, Janet Dacal, Bryonha Marie Parham, Emily Skinner, Brandon Uranowitz, Kaley Ann Voorhees, Michael Xavier, Tony Yazbeck, and Karen Ziemba.

In addition to musicals, Prince also directed operas including Josef Tal&#x27;s &quot;Ashmedai&quot;, Carlisle Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Willie Stark&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, and a revival of Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; (Tony Award, 1974). In 1983 Prince staged &quot;Turandot&quot; for the Vienna State Opera (conductor: Lorin Maazel; with José Carreras and Éva Marton).

===Legacy===
Prince was the inspiration for John Lithgow&#x27;s character in Bob Fosse&#x27;s film &quot;All That Jazz&quot;. He was also assumed to be the basis of a character in Richard Bissell&#x27;s novel &quot;Say, Darling&quot;, which chronicled Bissell&#x27;s own experience turning his novel &quot;7½ Cents&quot; into &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;.

According to Masterworks Broadway, &quot;besides his achievements as a producer and director, Prince is also known for bringing innovation to the theatrical arts. In collaboration with Stephen Sondheim, he was a pioneer in the development of the &#x27;concept musical,&#x27; taking its departure from an idea or theme rather than from a traditional story. Their first project of this kind, &quot;Company&quot; (1970), was a solid success and paved the way for other innovative musicals.&quot;

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;He was known, too, for his collaborations with a murderer&#x27;s row of creative talents, among them the choreographers Bob Fosse, Jerome Robbins, Michael Bennett and Susan Stroman; the designers Boris Aronson, Eugene Lee, Patricia Zipprodt and Florence Klotz; and the composers Leonard Bernstein, John Kander, Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber.&quot;

The Harold Prince Theatre at the Annenberg Center of the University of Pennsylvania is named in his honor.

A documentary titled &quot;Harold Prince: The Director&#x27;s Life&quot; was directed by Lonny Price and broadcast on PBS &quot;Great Performances&quot; in November 2018.

In 2019, The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts presented an extensive exhibit honoring the life and work of Harold Prince. Prince served as a trustee for the library and on the National Council of the Arts of the National Endowment for the Arts. At the behest of Lotte Lenya, whom he cast in &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966), Prince also served on the Board of Trustees of The Kurt Weill Foundation for Music and as a judge of their Lotte Lenya Competition.

Andrew Lloyd Webber said: &quot;There isn&#x27;t anybody working on musical theater on either side of the Atlantic who doesn&#x27;t owe an enormous debt to this extraordinary man...Hal was very minimalist with his sets. People think of &quot;Phantom&quot; as this great big spectacle. That&#x27;s an illusion. Hal always looked at the show as this big black box in which the stage craft enabled you to believe there was this impressive scenery all around you.&quot;

Jason Robert Brown said: &quot;More than anything else, when I think about Hal, I think about his belief in theater. He believed in what it could do...He thought a lot about the world and the political systems and emotional support systems in it. He was very much a political artist.&quot;

==Personal life==
Prince married Judy Chaplin, daughter of composer and musical director Saul Chaplin, on October 26, 1962. They are parents of Daisy Prince, a director, and Charles Prince, a conductor. Actor Alexander Chaplin, best known for his role as James Hobert on &quot;Spin City&quot;, is Prince&#x27;s son-in-law. At the time of his death, Prince lived in Manhattan and Switzerland.

===Death===
Prince died in Reykjavík, Iceland, on July 31, 2019, at the age of 91, after falling ill while traveling from Switzerland to the United States. Later that day, the marquee lights of Broadway&#x27;s theaters were dimmed in a traditional gesture of honor. A memorial was held at Broadway&#x27;s Majestic Theatre on December 16, 2019.
