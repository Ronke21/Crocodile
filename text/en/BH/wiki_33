<text>was a city located in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. It is currently part of the city of Ōshū. Mizusawa is home to one of the six International Latitude Observatories. The observatories were close to the parallel of 39 degrees 8 minutes north latitude. They worked together to study the Earth&#x27;s &quot;wobble&quot; using stars selected by Dr. Kimura, the astronomer in charge of the Mizusawa station. Twelve groups of stars that had six pairs of stars each were chosen. Two groups of stars were observed at each station following a schedule of dates, time, and duration prepared by Kimura.

As of February 2006, the city had an estimated population of 60,239 and a population density of 621.53 persons per km2. The total area was 96.92 km2.

==History==
* On April 1, 1889, the town of Mizusawa was created due to the establishment of the modern municipalities system (&quot;shichōson-sei&quot;).
* On April 1, 1954, Mizusawa became a city when the town absorbed the neighboring villages of Anetai, Shinjo, Sakuragawa, Kuroishi and Haneda.
* On February 20, 2006, Mizusawa, along with the city of Esashi, the towns of Isawa and Maesawa, and the village of Koromogawa (all from Isawa District), was merged to create the city of Ōshū, and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

<text>The Regional Municipality of Peel (informally Peel Region or Region of Peel, also formerly Peel County) is a regional municipality in the Greater Toronto Area, Southern Ontario, Canada. It consists of three municipalities to the west and northwest of the city of Toronto: the cities of Mississauga and Brampton, and the town of Caledon, each of which spans its full east–west width. The regional seat is in Brampton.

With a population of about 1.5 million, Peel Region&#x27;s growth can be credited largely to immigration and transportation infrastructure: seven 400-series highways serve the region and most of Toronto Pearson International Airport is located within its boundaries.

Mississauga, which occupies the southernmost portion of the region with over 800,000 residents, is the largest in population in Peel Region and is overall the seventh-largest lower-tier municipality in Canada. It reaches from Lake Ontario north to near Highway 407. Brampton, a city with over 600,000 residents, is located in the centre of the region, while in the north lies the town of Caledon, which is by far the largest town in the area and the most sparsely populated part of the region.

== History ==

The area was first settled in the early 1800s after being divided into townships in 1805; some of the townships came into existence later (to 1819). County of Peel was formed in 1851. It was named after Sir Robert Peel, the nineteenth-century Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

The townships that would eventually constitute Peel were initially part of York County in the Home District, and were designated as the West Riding of York in 1845.

In 1867, Peel officially separated from York County. Peel County was dissolved in 1974.

Brampton was virtually a village in 1834. The only building of consequence at the corner of Hurontario (now Main) and Queen Streets, today the centre of Brampton, was William Buffy&#x27;s tavern. In fact, at the time, the area was referred to as &quot;Buffy&#x27;s Corners&quot;. All real business in Chinguacousy Township took place one mile distant at Martin Salisbury&#x27;s tavern. By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, and applied the name &quot;Brampton&quot; to the area, which was soon adopted by others.

The Region of Peel was created by the government of Bill Davis in 1974 from the former Peel County, and was legislated to provide community services to the (then) rapidly urbanizing area of south Peel County (now Mississauga and Brampton). Most of Peel Region boundaries are the same as Peel County. Portions of the former Trafalgar Township in Halton County west of present-day Winston Churchill Boulevard to Ninth Line and south of Highway 407 to Dundas Street became part of Mississauga (forming western parts of Erin Mills and Meadowvale West, as well as Churchill Meadows from Town of Milton).

==Government and politics==

===Senior administrators===
The senior administrators of the region are:
*Nando Iannicca, Regional Chair
*Gary Kent, Chief Administrative Officer
*Sean Baird, Commissioner of Human Services
*Nancy Polsinelli, Commissioner of Health Services
*Davinder Valeri, Chief Financial Officer and Commissioner of Corporate Services
*Kealy Deadman, Commissioner of Public Works
*Patricia Caza, Commissioner of Legislative Service and Regional Solicitor

===Notable government decisions===

*In 2005, Peel Region approved without tender a $557 million waste management contract commitment lasting 20 years that can potentially allow it to dump garbage in Ontario landfill sites if Michigan bans Canadian trash.
*In 2004, Peel Region began a more than $600 million waterworks expansion by conducting invited public tenders, one of Canada&#x27;s largest in water and wastewater infrastructure.

=== Seat assignment controversy ===

Seats on Peel Regional council are not assigned to member municipalities according to population or tax contributions, and this has produced considerable controversy within the region.

Mississauga currently comprises about 62 per cent of the region&#x27;s population and says it contributes 66 per cent of the taxes, but had been assigned 10 of the 21 council seats (or 48 per cent) distributed among the municipalities, with Brampton receiving six and Caledon five. In June 2005, the provincial government passed legislation that will revise the composition of the council. Beginning in the 2006 municipal elections, one additional seat will be assigned to Brampton and two additional seats will be assigned to Mississauga, giving Mississauga 12 of the 24 seats assigned to municipalities. These numbers do not include the regional chair, who is appointed by council members.

These changes are the result of a provincially appointed impartial arbitrator who noted:

Mississauga council, led by former mayor Hazel McCallion, has argued that Peel Region is an unnecessary layer of government which costs Mississauga residents millions of dollars a year to support services in Brampton and Caledon. Mississauga council unanimously passed a motion asking the Province of Ontario to separate Mississauga from Peel Region and become a single-tier municipality, arguing, among other things, the need to keep property tax dollars within the city of Mississauga for the good of the future of the city.

Opponents of Mississauga&#x27;s position, including former Brampton mayor Susan Fennell, have argued that from the 1970s through the 1990s, Mississauga was the chief beneficiary of Peel&#x27;s infrastructure construction projects — funded by taxpayers in all three municipalities — and it is now Brampton&#x27;s turn to benefit, as it is growing faster than Mississauga, which is mostly built-out. As well, they have argued that common infrastructure, such as waste and water services, would be more efficiently managed at a regional level.

=== Attempted dissolution ===
On May 17, 2023, information leaked that Ontario premier Doug Ford intended to dissolve Peel Region and make the three lower-tier municipalities independent. Calls for Mississauga to be an independent city have existed for many years, including most notably by Mayor Bonnie Crombie, who called for that city to become a single-tier municipality since running for the position of mayor during the 2018 Mississauga municipal election. The following day the government officially announced their intention to dissolve the region.

Subsequently, Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark tabled Bill 112, the &quot;Hazel McCallion Act&quot;, which would dissolve the region on January 1, 2025. The bill was fast-tracked through Parliament, bypassing the committee stage and going straight to third reading. This was criticized by the opposition, claiming that it prevented proper consultation with Peel Region residents. The bill was passed in June 2023. To prepare for the dissolution, the Ontario government convened a 5-member transition board tasked with providing recommendations on winding down the operations of the regional government.

Brampton mayor Patrick Brown was resistant to dissolving the region, claiming that it would leave the city underfunded and interfere with municipal housing priorities. Brown had also demanded that Mississauga pay compensation to cover lost regional funding, which he claimed was critical to ensuring that an independent Brampton could function properly. Caledon mayor Annette Groves was completely opposed to the dissolution, claiming that Caledon was the &quot;child of the divorce&quot; and that they did not have the resources to function without regional funding. New Democrat MPP and municipal affairs critic Jeff Burch proposed having the rural areas of Caledon transferred to Dufferin County.

It had been proposed that some regional services, such as paramedics, public health and police, continue to be shared among the single-tier municipalities after the dissolution. However, there were disagreements over how the services would be funded. Crombie has pushed for them to be funded using a pay-per-usage model, while Brown wanted them to remain under the current assessment formula model.

After the transition board reported that the dissolution would cause heavy increases to municipal property taxes as a result of lost regional funding, the Ontario government announced that they would not continue with dissolving the region.

==Climate==
===Factors that influence the climate===
The region&#x27;s climate are influenced by various air masses and weather systems from other locations, proximity to Lake Ontario, topography and elevation (e.g. Niagara Escarpment, and Oak Ridges Moraine), and urban and rural land uses. The air masses and weather systems are the major factors in influencing the climate of the region. Being located in Southern Ontario, it is located between the Arctic, subtropics, and the Atlantic Ocean; consequentially, it is impacted by air masses from different origins. In general, the air masses that affect the region are continental polar, continental arctic, maritime polar, and occasionally continental tropical air masses in summer. During winter, cold and dry air masses predominate (continental arctic and maritime polar) although warmer, moister air masses may move north during this time, leading to milder temperatures and potential for heavy snowfall/freezing rain/rainfall. The most severe snow and freezing rain events occur when warmer, moister air masses move northward to the region and meet colder air. During winter, a common type of storm is known as the &quot;Alberta Clipper&quot; which affects the region in which moist Pacific air moves east of the Rocky Mountains to the region, bringing snow that is often followed by the influx of cold continental air afterwards (leads to colder temperatures). Spring and autumn are characterized by variable weather and rapid alternating air masses. This leads to frequent cloudy conditions, rain, and occasional thunderstorms. In summer, the air masses that influence the region are predominantly maritime polar air masses from the Pacific Ocean, and tropical air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, the latter being responsible for bringing heat waves, high humidity, and intense rainfall events. Towards late summer and early autumn, the remnants of tropical storms and hurricanes may bring strong winds and heavy rainfalls to the area. During autumn, Arctic air masses become increasingly common, leading to colder conditions.

The Great Lakes (particularly Lake Ontario) moderate the cooler air masses during autumn and winter, causing the region to have milder conditions than similar areas away from the Lakes. Because the Great Lakes are slower to warm than the land, they keep shoreline areas cooler in spring, leading to prolonged cool weather that persists well into April. The prolonged cool conditions on the shoreline causes the leafing and blossoming of the plants to be delayed, which protects tender plants such as fruit trees from being damaged by late spring frosts. Thus, plants from more warmer climates are able to survive on the shoreline due to this. Occasionally, temperature inversions can occur, particularly in spring and early summer. Temperature inversions occur when warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico moves pass the Great Lakes because while the top layers of the Lakes are warmed, the bottom layers remain cool, leading to moisture and airborne pollutants being trapped in the cool air below, humid days, and causing fog, haze, and smog in low laying industrial areas. The Great Lakes also stabilize conditions in spring and summer (due to the relatively cooler lake surfaces), leading to lower spring and summer precipitation on their shorelines compared to inland areas. In winter, lake effect snowfall occurs. In spring and summer, lake breezes can penetrate inland, creating narrow boundaries more inland causing cloudy conditions, severe thunderstorms, and convective rainfall events. This is known as the &quot;lake breeze front&quot; or &quot;lake breeze thunderstorms&quot; phenomenon, in which intense, sharply defined squall lines develop quickly on summer afternoons amplified by localized wind patterns between the Great Lakes. This is seen by the tendency for thunderstorms from the west to weaken/dissipate as they approach Toronto Pearson Airport, located in the southeastern part of the region.

===Temperature===
Temperatures are higher in the southern parts of Peel compared to the northern parts of the region. Annual temperatures are warmer in the south than in the northern parts of the region. This is due to the lower elevations found in the southern parts of the region, moderating effects of Lake Ontario, and more urbanization in the south (due to the urban heat island effect). In colder months, areas closer to Lake Ontario are warmer while in particularly in spring and summer, the same areas are cooler on many afternoons, owing to the moderating effect of the Lake.

===Precipitation===
Generally, the northwestern parts of Peel Region are the wettest areas both seasonally and annually while southern parts are the driest. Mean annual precipitation in the region ranges from in the northwest to in Mississauga in the south. The north–south precipitation gradient is primarily due to topographic and elevation differences, and some regional storm track differences. The regional storm track differences include the influence of the Great Lakes on summertime convective precipitation, northernmost extent to where tropical air progresses in winter, and positions of frontal zones in spring and autumn). These regional storm track differences are responsible for a slight rain shadow effect for most of Peel except for the northern parts which lie on the windward side and receive more precipitation from frontal systems moving from the west. In all seasons, precipitation mostly comes from low pressure systems from the mid-Atlantic states and Gulf of Mexico.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hanamaki peaked at around the year 2000 and has declined since.

==History==
The area of present-day Hanamaki was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period. During the Sengoku period, the area was dominated by various samurai clans before coming under the control of the Nambu clan during the Edo period, who ruled Morioka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The town developed as a post station on the Ōshū Kaidō highway during the Edo period.

In the Meiji period, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the modern towns of Hanamaki and Hanamaki-Kawaguchi were created within Hienuki District, Iwate. The two towns were merged on April 10, 1929, with the merged municipality retaining the name of Hanamaki. On April 1, 1954, the villages of Yuguchi, Yumoto, Miyanome, Yasawa and Ohta were annexed by Hanamaki. An additional village, Sasama, joined the following year.

In January 2006, Hanamaki merged with the towns of Ishidoriya, Ōhasama, thus dissolving Hienuki District, and with the town of Tōwa from Waga District.

==Government==
Hanamaki has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 25 members. Hanamaki contributes four seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Iwate 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Agriculture, notably dairy farming dominates the local economy. Hanamaki is also noted for electrical appliances. The area is also noted for its many &quot;onsen&quot; (hot spring) resorts.

==Education==
Fuji University, a private university, is located in Hanamaki.

The city government operates 19 public elementary schools and 11 public junior high schools. There are seven public high schools operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school.

==Local attractions==
Hanamaki is known historically for its many onsen (hot springs). Kenji Miyazawa&#x27;s various legacies are the old Hanamaki city&#x27;s other perennial tourist attraction; notably the Miyazawa Kenji Memorial Museum features several exhibitions related to his life and works. The city also has a ski slope.

One of Hanamaki&#x27;s most notable events is the Hanamaki Matsuri, an annual festival which takes place the second weekend of September and dates back to 1593. The three-day festivities include a dance of over one thousand synchronized traditional dancers; the carrying of over one hundred small shrines; and the parading of a dozen or so large, hand-constructed floats depicting historical, fictional, or mythical scenes and accompanied by drummers, flautists, and lantern-carriers. Of these dances, the most famous is &quot;Shishi Odori&quot; (dance of the deer). This dance involves men dressing as deer and banging drums.

With the city&#x27;s recent mergers, Hanamaki now lays claim to its absorbed towns&#x27; attractions. Ōhasama is famous for local varieties of traditional &quot;Kagura&quot; dance. &quot;Kagura&quot; dancers often appear at area festivals or functions. On a hill above the town of Ōhasama proper stands a statue resembling the wolf-like costumes donned by Hayachine Kagura dancers. Mt. Hayachine, which at 1917 m (6289 ft) is the second highest mountain in Iwate Prefecture, lies in the northeast section of Ōhasama. The area is home to the regionally well-known Edel Wine. In September, the Ōhasama Wine House hosts the annual Wine Festival. Around the time of Japan&#x27;s Girls&#x27; Festival, Ōhasama puts on displays of its collection of dolls, many of which are several hundred years old. Local history suggests that the dolls may have been given to residents of Ōhasama by travelers from Kyoto on their way to trade in Hokkaidō. Ishidoriya has a history of brewing &quot;sake&quot; connected with the Nambu &quot;Toji&quot; tradition.

==International relations==
* Berndorf, Austria, since 1965 
* Rutland, Vermont, United States, since October 8, 1986
* Hot Springs, Arkansas, United States, since January 15, 1993
* Xigang District, Dalian, Liaoning, China, friendship city since 2010

Each of the former towns merged with Hanamaki also conducted exchanges on their own, most of which have been taken up by the new Hanamaki city. Ōhasama was paired Berndorf. Mt. Hayachine is home to a particular species of edelweiss, called &quot;Hayachine Usuyukiso&quot;, which grows exclusively on Mt. Hayachine. It was because of this flower that mountain climbers from Ōhasama forged a friendship with those from Berndorf, Lower Austria. Ishidoriya was paired with Rutland, Vermont.

*Kazuhiro Hatakeyama, professional baseball player
*Tetsugoro Yorozu, painter

<doc id="328210" wikidata="Q724171" url="?curid=328210" title="Cleveland Gladiators">
<text>The Cleveland Gladiators were an arena football team based in Cleveland, Ohio, and members of the Arena Football League (AFL). The Gladiators played their home games at Quicken Loans Arena, which they shared with the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association and the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. The franchise was originally based in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and then later in Las Vegas, Nevada, before relocating to Cleveland for the 2008 AFL season. The Gladiators qualified for the playoffs eight times in their history, reaching the ArenaBowl in 2014.

The Gladiators announced that they would not play the 2018 and 2019 seasons due to renovations on Quicken Loans Arena that required it to close during the NBA offseason and were granted a two-season hiatus. Before the team could return in 2020, the league filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations.

==Team history==

===New Jersey Red Dogs (1997–2000)===

The New Jersey Red Dogs entered the Arena Football League in 1997, along with the Nashville Kats and the New York CityHawks. Their ownership group, which was led by New Jersey radio entrepreneur E. Burke Ross, also included several ex-NFL players, such as Joe Morris, Carl Banks, and Harry Carson. The name &quot;Red Dogs&quot; reflected the sponsorship of the Miller Brewing Company, the makers of Red Dog beer. The Red Dogs played at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The AFL&#x27;s intention was to add only New Jersey and Nashville for 1997. However, well after the awarding of the Red Dogs and Kats franchises, the owners of Madison Square Garden in New York City requested a franchise of their own, and the league granted this request. And so the CityHawks also began play in 1997. This affected the Red Dogs, in that the league then prevented the Red Dogs from advertising in New York. While North Jersey itself is very populous in its own right, the Red Dogs had hoped to be the team for the entire New York metropolitan area. Despite this setback, the Red Dogs management built a good team, which opened its history in memorable fashion. The team won 8 of its first 9 games, including a victory in their inaugural game on a last-second game-winning field goal, a thrilling overtime victory against the Albany Firebirds, a thorough thrashing of the Iowa Barnstormers (runners-up in the previous year&#x27;s ArenaBowl X), and also one game in which they scored a then-record 91 points against the Texas Terror. (This record has since been surpassed by the New York Dragons, who scored 99 in a game against the Carolina Cobras in 2001.)

The Red Dogs were led by head coach John Hufnagel, who had been a quarterback and offensive coordinator for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. After his time with the Red Dogs, Hufnagel went on to be an offensive coach for several National Football League teams, including the New England Patriots and the New York Giants. He then became the head coach of the CFL&#x27;s Stampeders for the 2008 season, and won the Grey Cup in his first season at the helm. Hufnagel brought in several players with CFL experience to the Red Dogs, including QB Rickey Foggie and offensive specialist Larry Ray Willis. The team&#x27;s other main receiver was Alvin Ashley, a player whose small size (150 lb.) made him unlikely to play in the NFL but suited the more compact Arena game.

The Red Dogs slumped late in their first season, losing 4 of their final 5 games to finish 9–5, then losing to the Orlando Predators in the first round of the playoffs.

The Red Dogs finished 8–6 in 1998, their second season, and won their first playoff game in Albany against the Firebirds.

Hufnagel left the Red Dogs after the 1998 season for a job with the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns, and he was replaced by Frank Mattiace, a former defensive lineman for the New Jersey Generals of the USFL. Star Larry Ray Willis was traded to the Milwaukee Mustangs Following those losses, the Red Dogs slumped in 1999 to their first losing season, going 6–8, despite winning 3 of their first 4.

The Red Dogs made a significant trade following the 1999 season, a trade they never got to benefit from. New Jersey sent Alvin Ashley to the Orlando Predators for wide receiver/defensive back Barry Wagner, widely regarded as the greatest player in the league&#x27;s history. However, soon after the trade, the league and its players agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement that resulted in several veteran players—including Wagner—gaining free agency. Wagner then signed with the San Jose SaberCats.

In 2000, the Red Dogs, without Wagner, Ashley, and offensive mainstay Chad Lindsey, fell to 4–10. Foggie lost his job as starting QB, replaced by Tommy Maddox, at the time a failed NFL quarterback. Head coach Frank Mattiace left the team in mid-season and was replaced on an interim basis by Kevin Guy, a former defensive back/wide receiver who had played two full seasons with the Red Dogs.

===New Jersey Gladiators (2001–2002)===
Before the 2001 season, the New Jersey team was sold to Jim Ferraro, a lawyer from Miami, Florida. Ferraro changed the team name to the New Jersey Gladiators. The new ownership appointed as head coach the ex-CityHawk boss Lary Kuharich, who had won ArenaBowl VII in 1993 with the Tampa Bay Storm; and it acquired Connell Maynor from Orlando to be the starting Quarterback. Maynor had led the Predators to victory in ArenaBowl XIV the previous season, and was named the game&#x27;s MVP. An all-around threat, Maynor had played with the CityHawks under Kuharich in 1997, but took only one snap all season as the backup to Mike Perez. Instead, the CityHawks used Maynor as a wide receiver/linebacker, and one week he even won the award for the league&#x27;s best &quot;ironman&quot; (player who plays both on offense and defense, as 6 of 8 players used to play both sides of the ball in Arena Football).

The Gladiators reached the lowest ebb in franchise history during the 2001 season, winning only 2 out of 14 games. The club&#x27;s top receivers attained roughly half the number of yards that Larry Ray Willis had achieved in each of the franchise&#x27;s first two seasons, and the rushing leader was quarterback Maynor himself.

In 2002, the club had another new coach, Frank Haege, who had been a Red Dog assistant under John Hufnagel. After leaving the Red Dogs, Haege went on to coach the Quad City Steamwheelers of the AFL&#x27;s minor-league circuit af2. Haege&#x27;s Quad City team had dominated the af2 for two seasons, winning 31 of 32 regular-season games — including one win by a score of 103–3 — and two championships (Haege was later charged by the AFL with violating the af2 salary cap rules at Quad City, and was fined heavily by the league. Also, the Quad City team was banned from the af2 playoffs in 2002). The Gladiators&#x27; new quarterback for 2002 was Jay McDonagh, who had played under Haege. Former Red Dog Alvin Ashley was back with the club, seeing limited duty; however, this time around the main New Jersey receiver was Mike Horacek, who had starred for the Iowa Barnstormers, and who later returned to that franchise to play for the Dragons. The Gladiators&#x27; fortunes turned around, and they had their first winning season since 1998, going 9–5 and hosting a playoff game for the first time (a loss to Orlando).

A few weeks before the start of the 2003 season (the first one to begin in February instead of April, and the first one in which the league&#x27;s games would be televised weekly by NBC), owner Ferraro moved the team to Las Vegas. The AFL schedules for the 2003 season had already been devised; so the Las Vegas Gladiators would play that season in the Eastern Division of the National Conference, before shifting in 2004 to the American Conference&#x27;s Western Division.

===Las Vegas Gladiators (2003–2007)===

The Gladiators relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada, for the 2003 season and played their home games at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This arena was also the home of a previous Arena team, the Las Vegas Sting, in 1994 and 1995. In 2007, in an effort to increase attendance, the Gladiators moved to the Orleans Arena. The move did not have the desired effect; the Gladiators averaged 5,383 fans in 2007, down from 10,115 in 2006.

The Gladiators competed in the Western Division of the AFL&#x27;s American Conference. The team went 31–50 in five years in Las Vegas, making the playoffs once.

===Cleveland Gladiators (2008–2017)===

====2008 season====
On October 16, 2007, it was announced in a press conference that the Gladiators would be relocating to Cleveland, Ohio. This would be the second arena football team to play be in the Cleveland area; the Cleveland Thunderbolts played at the Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio, for three seasons from 1992 to 1994. Former Cleveland Browns Quarterback Bernie Kosar was announced as the public face of the team, as well as the President of football operations and minority owner. The Gladiators would play their home games at Quicken Loans Arena, the home of the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers and the AHL&#x27;s Lake Erie Monsters. The team also moved back to the Eastern Division of the National Conference for the first time since 2003. The team would still be known as the Gladiators and continue to retain the team colors of red, silver, and black.

On March 3, the Gladiators played their inaugural game in Quicken Loans Arena, a 61–49 win over the New York Dragons. Raymond Philyaw, the team&#x27;s quarterback, was named the offensive player of the game after throwing for five touchdowns. The team&#x27;s first season in Cleveland was a successful one, as they went on to have a winning record of 9–7. On June 21, the Gladiators clinched a playoff berth with a 47–35 win against the Columbus Destroyers as well as home field advantage for the first round.

Cleveland won its first playoff game in 10 years with a 69–66 win over the Orlando Predators. Raymond Philyaw threw for 436 yards (the second-most yards in AFL postseason history) and eight touchdowns, receiver Robert Redd caught a franchise best 204 yards and four touchdowns, and Brandon Hefflin had two interceptions and recovered a key fumble late in the game to seal the victory. The following week, the Gladiators advanced to their first conference championship game in team history when they beat the Georgia Force in the divisional round 73–70. Raymond Philyaw had eight touchdown passes and Robert Redd and Otis Amey each caught three touchdowns in the win. The 61 points scored by both teams in the second quarter was also an AFL record for combined points in a quarter. The Gladiators then traveled to Philadelphia to face the Soul in the National Conference Championship game. Unfortunately, their season ended one game short of the Arena Bowl with a tough 70–35 loss.

====2009: AFL suspends operations====
The National Conference Championship would be the Gladiators&#x27; last game for almost two years. The Arena Football League canceled its 2009 season and it seemed that operations would be suspended indefinitely. However, the league reorganized as Arena Football 1 before purchasing the assets of the Arena Football League, therefore assuming the AFL&#x27;s history, and the Gladiators were revived for the 2010 season, with owner Jim Ferraro and Bernie Kosar returning as team president and Quicken Loans Arena continuing to act as the team&#x27;s home field. On December 23, 2009, former Grand Rapids Rampage coach Steve Thonn was named as new head coach of the Gladiators. Soon after, Arena Football 1 decided to re-adopt the Arena Football League name.

====2010 season====
During their first season in two years, the Gladiators hovered around .500 for the majority of the time. Highlights of the season included blowout victories over the Utah Blaze and the Iowa Barnstormers, but there were also some close losses attributed to poor special teams play. On July 17, during their 15th game of the season, the Gladiators were officially eliminated from playoff contention when their division rivals the Milwaukee Iron defeated the Orlando Predators. The Gladiators finished their 2010 campaign with a 7–9 record.

====2011 season====
The Gladiators returned in 2011 with Steve Thonn once again serving as head coach. John Dutton also returned as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. The Gladiators started their 2011 campaign successfully, upsetting the Spokane Shock, the defending ArenaBowl Champions, at their own arena. However, this victory was marred by an Achilles&#x27; heel injury to John Dutton in the final minutes, which would ultimately sideline him for the season. Fortunately, the team&#x27;s backup quarterback Kurt Rocco performed well in his first Arena football start as the Gladiators 3–0. In their home opener, wide receiver Troy Bergeron set a Gladiator franchise record with six touchdown catches during the game. Unfortunately, the Gladiators were not able to post their best start in franchise history, losing the next two weeks. Injuries to Rocco during midseason led to third-string quarterback and Cleveland-area Case Western University alum Dan Whalen mounting second half comebacks. However, Rocco would eventually retake the starting position for the rest of the season.

Through 2011, the Gladiators were very strong at home but often mediocre on the road. Though they finished with a 7–1 record at Quicken Loans Arena, they were only 3–6 in away games. But the season ultimately ended with success, as the team beat their newest rival, the Pittsburgh Power, to clinch the American Conference East Division and guarantee a spot in the playoffs. This was the second time in three seasons that Gladiators will enter the playoffs while in Cleveland, as well as the first time they have clinched the East Division.

The team entered the playoffs with a 10–8 record to face the Georgia Force in the first round. Despite playing at home, the Gladiators played poorly in the second half and were eliminated from contention, losing 50–41.

====2012 season====
On January 17, 2012, the Gladiators were sold to Cleveland Cavaliers and Lake Erie Monsters owner Dan Gilbert. With John Dutton back as the starting quarterback, the Gladiators began their 2012 campaign successfully, reaching a record of 6–3 at the midway point of the season. However, the team then went on a five-game losing streak, which included some controversy when on June 8, 2012, the Gladiators lost by forfeit to the Pittsburgh Power. This was the first ever game forfeited in AFL history, due to the Gladiators (representing the AFL players&#x27; union) going on strike to protest on-field safety concerns and contract disputes with AFL management. Though the Gladiators would end the streak with a Week 16 win against division rival Milwaukee, two more losses against Orlando and Utah officially eliminated the team from playoff contention. The Gladiators finished the 2012 season at 8–10, second place in the East Division.

====2013 season====
The Gladiators&#x27; 2012–2013 offseason saw the departure of veteran quarterback John Dutton, who had been with the team for the past three seasons. The team&#x27;s fifth season in Cleveland was a struggle, as the Gladiators never were able to have any long sustained success over the course of the year, finishing at 4-14 (tied with Pittsburgh for the worst record in the entire Arena League).

====2014 season====
The Gladiators began the 2014 season winning their first nine games, more than doubling their entire win total from the previous season (four). They didn&#x27;t lose a game until being defeated by the Pittsburgh Power 48–34 on May 31 – more than two months into the season. On Saturday June 7, 2014, the Gladiators set a team record for points scored in a game when they defeated the Iowa Barnstormers 86–49. On July 12, 2014, following their 50–47 overtime win over the San Antonio Talons, the Gladiators clinched the East Division Championship, and the #1 seed in the American Conference for the 2014 playoffs. On July 26, 2014, the Gladiators set an AFL record for wins in a single season by going 17–1 after defeating the Tampa Bay Storm, 56–49. This gave the Gladiators home field advantage throughout the 2014 AFL playoffs. On August 2, 2014, the Gladiators defeated the Philadelphia Soul, 39–37, on a last second field goal by Aaron Pettrey in the first round of the AFL playoffs to advance to the American Conference finals. On August 10, 2014, the Gladiators defeated the Orlando Predators 56–46 to win the American Conference Championship, and advance to the ArenaBowl for the first time in franchise history. In ArenaBowl XXVII, the Gladiators were defeated by the Arizona Rattlers, 72–32.

====2015 season====
The Gladiators opened the 2015 season by winning their first two games; however, on April 11 in an ArenaBowl XXVII rematch, the Gladiators lost to the Arizona Rattlers 49–41 in their home opener. Overall, the Gladiators were not able to replicate the success of 2014, finishing with a regular season record of 8–10, second in the East Division. This overall record did qualify for the 2015 AFL playoffs, drawing the East Division Champion Philadelphia Soul in the first round. The Gladiators&#x27; season ended on August 15 when they lost to Philadelphia 47–35 in the first round of the AFL playoffs.

====2016 season====
For the 2016 season, the AFL featured eight teams, due to a number of teams either folding or moving to other indoor football leagues. As part of the restructuring, the Gladiators were moved from the American to the National Conference, so as to give each conference four teams. They finished the regular season at 7–9, third place in the National Conference.

In the first round of the AFL playoffs, the Gladiators rallied and defeated the Los Angeles KISS 56–52 after trailing the bulk of the game. The Gladiators then lost to the Arizona Rattlers 82–41 in the National Conference championship game, ending their season.

====2017 season====
In 2017, the AFL was reduced from eight teams down to five, due to teams folding or transferring to other leagues. With only five teams, the AFL essentially played a round-robin style 14 game schedule, with the top four teams at the end of the season advancing to the playoffs. The Gladiators finished at 5–9, clinching third place and a playoff spot. Cleveland would go on to lose to the #2 seed Tampa Bay Storm 73–59 in the AFL semifinals to end their season.

====Suspension of operations: 2017====
In September 2017, it was announced that Quicken Loans Arena would be undergoing significant renovations during the 2018 and 2019 basketball offseason so as not to conflict with its primary tenant, the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers. However, as the AFL season runs into the basketball offseason, the Gladiators had to take a two-year leave of absence beginning in November 2017 with hopes to return for the 2020 season.

When the renovations were completed, the league suspended all city-based team operations for at least the 2020 season putting the Gladiators&#x27; plans on hold. The AFL filed for bankruptcy November 27, 2019, and ceased operations.

The area of present-day Kitakami was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period by the Emishi people. The area was a stronghold for the Emishi chieftain Aterui until his death at the hands of Sakanoue Tamuramaro. During the later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Abe clan, and became a battleground during the Former Nine Years War. The Abe were followed by the Northern Fujiwara clan. During the Sengoku period, the area came under the control of the Nanbu clan. The area was part of Morioka Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate, with the exception of two villages on its southeastern border, which were under Sendai Domain.

The town of Kurosawajiri was established by the Meiji period creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1891.

Kuji has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), characterized by mild summers and cool winters. The average annual temperature in Kuji is 9.7 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1176 mm with September as the wettest month and February as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around -1.9 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kuji peaked around the year 1960 and has declined by roughly one-third since then.

==History==
The area of present-day Kuji was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period. Amber from the area has been found at archaeological sites dating from the Nara period at the site of Heijō-kyō and Fujiwara-kyō. The area came under the control of the central government only after 1070 AD in the mid-Heian period. From the Kamakura period, the area came under the control of the Nanbu clan, and during the Edo period, was part of Hachinohe Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The area was noted for its production of ironsand, essential in the production of Japanese swords. These deposits were exploited commercially from the Meiji period, but were exhausted by the 1960s.

In the early Meiji period, the town of Kuji was created within Kita-Kunohe District on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The area was devastated by a tsunami in 1896, which killed 789 inhabitants. Kita-Kunohe District and Minami-Kunohe Districts merged to form Kunohe District on April 1, 1897. In January 1926, much of the town was destroyed by a fire which consumed 224 houses. An even larger fire in April 1945 destroyed 950 houses. The modern city was founded on November 3, 1954, with the merger of the towns of Kuji and Osanai with the villages of Samuraihama, Yamane, Natsui, Ube, and Okawame. In April 1983, a fire destroyed 61 homes in the city.

On March 6, 2006, the village of Yamagata (from Kunohe District), was merged into Kuji.

Kuji suffered extensive damage from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, with the tsunami reaching in some locations, and the tsunami damage extending inland. A total of 444 houses were destroyed, and 410 houses extensively damaged, but there were only four confirmed fatalities, with two residents missing.

==Government==
Kuji has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 24 members. Kuji, together with the neighboring village of Noda, contributes two seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy is based on agriculture (primarily spinach) and commercial fishing. The Japan Underground Oil Storage Company operates a 1.67 million kiloliter underground petroleum storage facility in Kuji.

==Education==
Kuji has 15 public elementary schools and ten public middle schools operated by the city government. The Iwate Prefectural Board of Education operates three public high schools, as well as one special education school. There is also one private high school.

==International relations==
* Franklin, Indiana, USA, sister city since October 1960
* Klaipėda, Lithuania, sister city since 1991.

=== Ties with Franklin === 
In 1960 a sister city bond was established via Mayor Frank S. Records of Franklin, Indiana and Mayor Gyobun Yamauchi, Mayor of Kuji, Japan. A Franklin College graduate and childhood resident of Franklin, Miss Thomasine Allen had traveled to Japan to pursue Christian missionary work. After teaching in various locations in Japan for several years from 1915, she found her way to Kuji, Japan in 1938 and spent the rest of her life there (with the exception of repatriation during WWII), establishing Christian facilities including a kindergarten, hospital, church and college. Upon establishment of the sister city relationship, Thomasine Allen was voted by the City Council of Kuji to be an honorary citizen of the city.

=== Ties with Klaipėda ===
Partnership between Kuji and Klaipėda began in 1989, one year before the independence of Lithuania, hence becoming the first Lithuanian sister city in Japan. In January 1991, then-Mayor of Kuji, Yoshiaki Kuji, condemned the military actions of Soviet Union by sending a protest note to the General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev. The 1995 World Municipalities Congress in The Hague recognised Klaipėda&#x27;s and Kuji&#x27;s cities cooperation as an example to follow. Congress expressed hope that this cooperation will inspire other Lithuania&#x27;s and Japan&#x27;s cities to expand their partnership.

==Noted people from Kuji==
*Tochinohana Hitoshi, sumo wrestler
*Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki, judoka
*Kyuzo Mifune, judoka

<text>is a city in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 26,378, and a population density of 31.6 persons per km2 in 10,759 households. The total area of the city is . Tōno is known as &quot;The City of Folklore&quot; for its rural nature, its preservation of traditional culture and especially for the collection of folktales, &quot;Tōno Monogatari,&quot; written by Kunio Yanagita in 1910.

==Geography==
Tōno is located in central Iwate Prefecture, in the floodplain of the Sarugaishi River, surrounded by a ring of mountains. Mount Hayachine sits at the northernmost point of the city where Hanamaki, Kawai and Tōno meet. At 1,914 meters it is also the city&#x27;s highest point. Mt. Rokkoushi, (1,294 meters) dominates the landscape to the east and Mt. Ishigami (1,038 meters) is the highest mountain in the west. Together these peaks form Tōno&#x27;s &quot;big three&quot; mountains. The highest points in southern Tōno are Mt. Sadato (884 meters) on the border of Sumida and Mt. Tane (871 meters) on the borders of Sumita and Ōshū.

Accordingly, to legend, in the past the hills in Miyamori blocked the Sarugaishi River creating a large lake in the Tōno area. Miyamori itself is characterized by a series of valleys to the west of Mt. Ishigami that flow west into the Sarugaishi River just below the Tase Dam.

Later the area was inhabited by the Emishi and many place names are based on the Ainu language. In the Early Nine-Years War lasting from 1051 to 1063, Minamoto no Yoshiie fought running battles with Abe no Sadato throughout the area. There are references to this in &quot;Tōno Monogatari&quot; and arrowheads still turn up from time to time. Later the Hiraizumi Fujiwara controlled Tōno which was a prized area for horse breeding, farming and hunting.

During the Sengoku period, the area was dominated by various samurai clans before coming under the control of the Nambu clan during the Edo period, who ruled Morioka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The Nambu built Nabekura Castle in what is now known as Nabekura Park in downtown Tōno as a defence against the powerful Date clan of Sendai Domain to then south, and assigned to Nanbu Naoyoshi, formerly castellan of Ne Castle near Hachinohe in 1627. This formed an unofficial subsidiary 12,500 &quot;koku&quot; domain of Morioka Domain, which lasted until the Meiji restoration.

With the Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system, the town of Tōno was established on April 1, 1889 within Nishihei District of Iwate Prefecture. In 1896, Nishihei and Minamihei districts were merged to form Kamihei District. During the Meiji period, Tōno developed a silk and cotton weaving industry dependent on Morioka. The silk industry was destroyed by intensely cold weather during the winter of 1905–06. The residents of Tōno were reduced to eating wild roots by the famine of this period and many died or moved away.

The city of Tōno was officially founded on December 1, 1954 by the merger of the former town of Tōno with the seven villages of Ayaori, Otomo, Tsukimoushi, Matsuzaki, Tsuchibuchi, Aozasa and Kamigo.

On October 1, 2005, the village of Miyamori (from Kamihei District) was merged into Tōno to bring the city to its present boundaries.

==Government==
Tōno has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of eighteen members. Tōno contributes one seat to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Iwate 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Education==
There are two senior high schools in Tōno, under the purview of Iwate&#x27;s Prefectural Board of Education. Iwate Prefectural Tōno Senior High School offers an academic curriculum, while Iwate Prefectural Tōno Ryokuhō Senior High School is vocational.

The Tōno city board of education operates three junior high schools: Tōno, Tōno-Higashi, and Tōno-Nishi, and 11 elementary schools: Aozasa, Ayaori, Kamigō, Masuzawa, Miyamori, Otomo, Tassobe, Tōno, Tōno North, Tsuchibuchi, and Tsukimoushi.

===Folklore===
Tōno is known throughout Japan as the cradle of &quot;Tōno Monogatari&quot; (&quot;Tales of Tōno&quot;), written in 1910 by Kunio Yanagita, who gathered folk tales of the area. This book is now considered one of the greatest studies of Japanese folklore, and inspired the 1982 movie of the same name.

Several of these tales involve the Kappa, mischievous water sprites. A legendary location in Tōno is the &quot;Kappa-buchi&quot;, a water stream where kappas are said to live.

The mascot of the city, &quot;Karin-chan&quot;, is a cute kappa holding a bellflower. She is usually depicted walking in front of a .

===National Historic Sites===

==International relations==
* Salerno, Italy, since August 8, 1984
* Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States, since September 15, 2017
Tōno is also twinned with three Japanese cities:
* Mitaka, Tokyo, since 1989
* Musashino, Tokyo, since 1988
* Kikuchi, Kumamoto, since 1998

From 1990 to 2010, the high schools of Tōno and the Chattanooga School for the Arts &amp; Sciences (CSAS) in Chattanooga, Tennessee were paired by School Partners Abroad to establish an exchange program. Near the end of every Japanese school year (in March), a delegation of Tōno high-school students visited Chattanooga, and reciprocally, a delegation from CSAS visited Tōno every summer. The city of Tōno embraced this exchange and organized a delegation of junior high school students to visit CSAS and the Chattanooga School for the Liberal Arts (CSLA) a few weeks before the high school students. After many delegations between the two cities, Chattanooga and Tono became sister cities on September 15, 2017.

<text>The Mississaugas are a group of First Nations peoples located in southern Ontario, Canada. They are a sub-group of the Ojibwe Nation.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Mississauga&quot; comes from the Anishinaabe word &quot;Misi-zaagiing&quot;, meaning &quot;[Those at the] Great River-mouth.&quot; It is closely related to the Ojibwe word &quot;Miswe-zaagiing&quot;, which means ‘a river with many outlets.’

==History==
According to the oral histories of the Anishinaabe, after departing the &quot;Second Stopping Place&quot; near Niagara Falls, the core Anishinaabe peoples migrated along the shores of Lake Erie to what is now southern Michigan. They became &quot;lost&quot; both physically and spiritually. The Mississauga migrated along a northern route by the Credit River, to Georgian Bay. These were considered their historic traditional lands on the shores of Lake Superior and northern Lake Huron around the Mississagi River. The Mississauga called for the core Anishinaabe to &quot;Midewiwin&quot;, meaning &#x27;return to the path of the good life&#x27;. The core Anishinaabe peoples formed the Council of Three Fires and migrated from their &quot;Third Stopping Place&quot; near the present city of Detroit to their &quot;Fourth Stopping Place&quot; on Manitoulin Island, along the eastern shores of Georgian Bay.

The homelands of the Mississaugas were originally claimed by the Huron/Wyandot, who were driven off by the Iroquois in the Beaver Wars in 1649/50. The Ojibwe Anishinaabe then moved into the area around 1700, pushing out the Iroquois. The French had previously called an Anishinaabe band near the Mississagi River &quot;Oumisagai&quot; or &quot;Mississauga&quot; and for unknown reasons began to apply that name to the Ojibwe who took over the lands immediately north of Lake Ontario. On the 1675 &quot;Carte du Mississippi et des lacs Supérieur, Michigan et Huron&quot;, the Mississauga were recorded as &quot;Missisakingdachirinouek&quot; (&quot;Misi-zaaging dash ininweg&quot;: &quot;Regular-speakers of the Great River-mouth&quot;). This was not how the Mississaugas originally knew themselves, but they eventually adopted the name and use it today.

When Conrad Weiser conducted a census in Logstown in 1748, he identified the people as &quot;Tisagechroamis&quot;, his attempt at conveying the sound of their exonym name in Wendat. Other variants of this spelling were &quot;Tisagechroamis&quot;, &quot;Tisaghechroamis&quot;, &quot;Tisagechroan&quot;, &quot;Tisagechroanu&quot;, and &quot;Zisaugeghroanu&quot;. &quot;The Tisagechroanu were the Mississagas from Lake Huron, a large tribe of French Indians, or under French influences. The name Tisagechroanue here is probably a misprint, for it is most often found Zisaugeghroanu.&quot;
Starting in 1781 during the waning years of the American Revolutionary War, the Crown purchased land which encompassed much of present-day southern Ontario from the Mississauga in a series of transactions. They purchased the land to fulfill promises made in the Haldimand Proclamation concerning land promised to the Iroquois for their support for the Crown during the war, and to compensate the Iroquois for losing territory to American colonists. The sale of land by the Mississaugas of the Credit to the Crown was referred to as the &quot;Between the Lakes Treaty.&quot;

In 1848, the Iroquois granted land to the Mississauga within the former&#x27;s Six Nations Reserve on Grand River. The Mississauga became established on the New Credit. Beginning in the 19th century, the Mississauga sought to gain compensation for the land granted to them but given to other settlers. In the 21st century, the Canadian government awarded the Mississauga of the New Credit First Nation nearly $145 million in settlement of this land claim.

==Legacy==
* The city of Mississauga is named after them.
* The Western and Eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus) are named after them.
* Fort Mississauga is named after them.

==Today==
All the Mississaugas are a subset of the Ojibwe nation of 200,000 people.

Historically, there were five First Nations that made up the Mississauga Nations. Today, there are six, listed here along with their historical counterparts, where applicable:

*Mississauga First Nation — Mississagi River 8 Reserve

**Mississaugas of Beldom (historical)
**Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation — New Credit 40A Reserve. One of the largest communities; as of 2005, the Mississaugas of the Credit had a population of 1,375. 
* Mississaugas of Matchedash (historical)
* Mississaugas of Rice Lake, Mud Lake and Scugog Lake (historical)

<text>The Los Angeles Avengers were an Arena Football League team based in Los Angeles, California, from 2000 through 2008. They folded on April 19, 2009.

==History==
The Los Angeles Avengers played their home games at the Staples Center, which is also the current home to the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League, the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association. The team began play in the 2000 season. The Avengers competed in the Western Division of the American Conference. Since its inception in 2000, the Avengers had competed in postseason play five times. The Avengers earned American Conference wildcard playoff berths in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2007, and won the American Conference Western Division Championship in 2005.

The Avengers franchise was owned by Casey Wasserman, grandson of the MCA head Lew Wasserman.

As part of the Avengers&#x27;s marketing plan as they got off the ground in 2000, the team placed risqué billboard slogans around Greater Los Angeles, with slogans including &quot;On April 9th, Twelve Men Will Go Both Ways,&quot; meaning the members will play both offense and defense. One such sign, reading &quot;Six Beautiful Women Will Show You Their Panties&quot; (a joking reference to the team&#x27;s cheerleaders) aroused the ire of Rick Cole, then City Manager of Azusa. He responded by borrowing a City truck and splashing paint over the sign, further publicizing the Avengers. Following Rick Cole&#x27;s apology and compensation payments, the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s office chose not to file vandalism charges.

On April 10, 2005, in a game against the New York Dragons, offensive lineman/defensive tackle Al Lucas tackled Corey Johnson during a kickoff return with 10:17 to go in the first quarter. Replays showed that Johnson&#x27;s knee hit Lucas&#x27; helmet, and Lucas did not move again after falling to the ground. Later replays and reports showed nothing abnormal on the play. Dr. William Lang, the team physician, attempted to revive him on the field. He appeared to suffer a spinal cord injury. After being treated for approximately a half an hour at the Staples Center, Lucas was rushed to nearby California Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 1:28pm PDT. He was only 26 years of age. It is unknown whether Lucas died on the field, or after treatment failed. An autopsy revealed that he died of blunt force trauma and an upper spinal cord injury. It is the only fatal injury incurred during a game in the history of the league. The Al Lucas Hero Award is named after him.

The Avengers announced the termination of the program on April 20, 2009, after nine years of operation. Four years later, it was announced that the Los Angeles KISS would join the AFL starting in the 2014 season making them the fourth team to set up shop in the Los Angeles area.

The Avengers&#x27; official mascot was a superhero-like character named T.D.

==Memorable Avengers&#x27; highlights==
* On Sunday, March 30, 2003, in a Week 9 road game against the Orlando Predators, the Avengers trailed 63–58 late in the game. However, Los Angeles managed to recover an onside kick and, on the last play of the game, quarterback Tony Graziani threw a 32-yard touchdown pass that bounced off the rebound net and was caught by WR/LB Greg Hopkins, giving the Avengers a 64–63 win.
* On Sunday, March 31, 2004, In the championship series taking place at Staples Center, Los Angeles, Ca. #98 John Garcia not only led the team in sacks on this day with 3 also blocked and returned a FG to win the game against the Chicago Rush. Final Score 24–26. Quarterback Tony Graziani threw for only 1 Touchdown pass and 3 INT&#x27;s.

<text>Shigefumi Hino (日野 重文 &quot;Hino Shigefumi&quot;, born 1963) is a Japanese graphics designer, game director and planner from Nintendo. He is the creator of Yoshi from the &quot;Yoshi&quot; franchise. Hino later served as the director of the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series, alongside Masamichi Abe.

==Career==
Shigefumi Hino joined Nintendo in 1989, where his first project was designing a sequel to &quot;Famicom Grand Prix: F1 Race&quot;, which was ultimately unreleased. His first released product was &quot;Super Mario World&quot; in 1990, where he created the game&#x27;s pixel art, as well as the character Yoshi, based on a rough sketch by Takashi Tezuka. Afterwards, Hino had the idea for a game with Yoshi as the main character, which would become &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. He chose a hand-drawn visual style to differentiate it from Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, a game that notably used pre-rendered 3D graphics.

Hino then co-directed &quot;Pikmin&quot; and &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; with Masamichi Abe, as well as &quot;Pikmin 3&quot; with Yuji Kando. He has additionally worked as a designer for &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Maker 2&quot;.

The average annual temperature is . The average annual rainfall is , with September as the wettest month and January as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Rikuzentakata peaked in the 1950s and has declined steadily over the past 70 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Rikuzentakata was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period. The area was inhabited by the Emishi people, and came under the control of the imperial dynasty during the early Heian period. During the Sengoku period, the area was dominated by various samurai clans before coming under the control of the Date clan during the Edo period, who ruled Sendai Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate.

The towns of Kesen and Takata were established within Kesen District on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipality system. The area was devastated by the 1896 Sanriku earthquake and the 1933 Sanriku earthquake. Kesen and Takata merged with the neighboring town of Hirota and villages of Otomo, Takekoma, Yokota and Yonezaki on January 1, 1955 to form the city of Rikuzentakata.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami===
Rikuzentakata was almost completely destroyed by the tsunami following the Tōhoku earthquake. According to the police, every building smaller than three stories high was completely flooded, with buildings bigger than three stories high being flooded partially, one of the buildings being the city hall, where the water also reached as high as the third floor. The Japan Self-Defense Forces initially reported that between 300 and 400 bodies were found in the town.
On 14 March, an illustrated BBC report showed a picture of the town, describing it as &quot;almost completely flattened.&quot; The town&#x27;s tsunami shelters were designed for a wave of in height, but the tsunami of March 2011 created a wave high which inundated the designated safe locations. Local officials estimated that 20% to 40% of the town&#x27;s population has been killed. Although the town was prepared for earthquakes and tsunamis and had a seawall, it was not enough and more than 80% of 8,000 houses were swept away.

A BBC film dated 20 March reported that the harbour gates of the town failed to shut as the tsunami approached, and that 45 young firemen were swept away while attempting to close them manually. The same film reported that 500 bodies had been recovered in the town, but that 10,000 people were still unaccounted-for out of a population of 26,000. As of 3 April 2011, 1,000 people from the town were confirmed dead with 1,300 still missing. In late May 2011, an Australian reporter interviewed a surviving volunteer firefighter who said 49 firefighters were killed in Rikuzentakata by the tsunami, among 284 firefighters known to have died along the affected coast, many while closing the doors of the tsunami barriers along the seashore.

Sixty-eight city officials, about one-third of the city&#x27;s municipal employees, were killed. The town&#x27;s mayor at the time, Futoshi Toba, was at his post at the city hall and survived, but his wife was killed at their seaside home. The wave severely damaged the artifact and botanical collection at the city&#x27;s museum and killed all six staff. The final death toll was 1,656 killed and 223 missing and presumed dead. Portions of the city subsided by over a meter.

As a countermeasure against future tsunami, Rikuzentakata&#x27;s city centre was elevated upon rock fill in a megaproject. In 2014, a massive conveyor belt system was being used to carry rock from a hill across the Kesen River from the city centre. The conveyor belt system featured a long suspension span that crossed the Kesen River, and was named the &quot;Bridge of Hope.&quot; The project elevated the city centre by more than .

Currently a new marketplace and community center has been established upon one such elevated plot of land, and work is ongoing to create a new street grid. In addition, new bridges are being established across the Kesen River, including an extension and bypass for the Sanriku Expressway and Japan National Route 45. The location of the rock quarry for the reconstruction megaproject is being developed as a new neighborhood.

==Government==
Rikuzentakata has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members. Rikuzentaka, together with the town of Sumita together contributes one seat to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy of Rikuzentakata is based heavily on commercial fishing and food processing. As of 2011, oyster farming produced ¥40 million in annual sales for the city.

==Education==
Rikuzentakata has eight public elementary schools and two public junior high schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school.

===Takata-matsubara===
 was a two-kilometre stretch of shoreline that was lined with approximately seventy thousand pines. In 1927 it was selected as one of the 100 Landscapes of Japan (Shōwa era) and in 1940 it was designated a Place of Scenic Beauty. After the 2011 tsunami a single, ten-metre, two-hundred-year-old tree remained from the forest. Due to land subsidence and coastal erosion this was only five metres from the sea and was at threat from increased salinity. The Association for the Protection of Takata-Matsubara along with the municipal and prefectural governments took measures, including the erection of barriers, to protect the surviving pine.

As of September 2011, there were signs that these measures had failed, and that the tree was dead due to salt water poisoning. In September 2012, the tree was felled for preservation and replaced in 2013 with an artificial &quot;commemorative tree&quot;.

<text>is a city located on the Sanriku rias coast in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 32,609, and a population density of 74 persons per km2, in 16,230 households. The total area of the city is 

==Geography==
Kamaishi is located in the Kitakami Mountains of south-central Iwate Prefecture, with the Pacific Ocean to the east. The spectacular, rugged coast of Kamaishi is entirely within the Sanriku Fukkō National Park. There are four large bays, Ōtsuchi Bay in the north, Ryōishi Bay, Kamaishi Bay and Tōni Bay in the south. Each is separated by large, rocky, pine-covered peninsulas which jut out into the Pacific Ocean. Immediately the rocky cliffs develop into hills rising to along the coast and farther inland.

The highest point in Kamaishi is Mount Goyōzan in the southwest at 1,341.3 meters in elevation. Most of the land is mountainous, allowing for little agriculture. The main rivers are the Kasshigawa River which empties into Kamaishi Bay and the Unosumai River which empties into Ōtsuchi Bay. Both have small floodplains that allow for development and agriculture.

The average annual rainfall is 1453 mm with September as the wettest month and February as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around -0.8 °C.

==Demographics==
According to Japanese census data, the population of Kamaishi peaked in around the year 1960 has declined steadily over the past 60 years.

==History==
===Pre-Meiji Kamaishi===
The area of present-day Kamaishi was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period. The area was inhabited by the Emishi people, and came under the control of the imperial dynasty during the early Heian period. During the Sengoku period, the area was dominated by various samurai clans before coming under the control of the Nambu clan during the Edo period, who ruled Morioka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. Before the discovery of magnetite in 1727, Kamaishi was little different from any of the other small fishing communities along the coast. However, it was not until 1857, and the construction of the first small blast furnace, that any real changes could be seen. In the 1850s, the feudal domains of Japan were engaged in an arms race to develop the first Western-style armaments, particularly large guns. The Nanbu Domain constructed blast furnaces of a foreign design in Kamaishi under the direction of military engineer Takatō Ōshima. Ten furnaces were built in all but some were owned by private corporations. The first of these furnaces was lit on December 1, 1857; a day honored as the start of modern iron production in Japan.

===Early modern Kamaishi===
In the Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system, the town of Kamaishi was established within Minamihei District, Iwate on April 1, 1889. Minamihei and Nishihei Districts merged to form Kamihei District in 1896. Kamaishi attained city status on May 5, 1937, and expanded in 1955 with the absorption of the neighboring villages of Kasshi, Unosumai, Kurihashi from Kamihei District and the village of Tōni from Kesen District.

In 1875, the newly established Meiji government bought all of the furnaces and created the Kamaishi Iron Works. They also put Ōshima and a German engineer in charge of its modernization. The German director imported two large steam-driven blast furnaces of the latest design from Britain and set up a railway with 15 miles of track and a locomotive purchased from Manchester to deliver the ore. Production began in 1880 but had to be stopped soon after due to a lack of charcoal. An attempt to resume operations in 1882 by replacing charcoal with coke failed and the plant was closed.

There were cholera outbreaks in Kamaishi in July 1882 and April 1884. The first left 302 people dead and warnings about the drinking water were posted throughout the prefecture.

In 1885, a new foundry was established which used coal from Hokkaido and iron ore from China.

The 1896 Sanriku earthquake struck on June 15 at 7:32 pm while families were celebrating Boy&#x27;s Festival on the beach. The earthquake measured magnitude 8.5 while the tsunami on the Iwate coast reached as high as 24 meters in places – the highest ever recorded in Japan at the time. The city of Kamaishi was completely destroyed. The French Catholic missionary Henri Lispard was also swept out to sea and died when the wave struck.
===Kamaishi in WWII===
As an important foundry town, Kamaishi played a significant role in the Japanese war effort and was targeted by the U.S. Navy during World War II. On 14 July 1945, under the command of Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth Jr., the battleships , , , and , the heavy cruisers and , and nine destroyers bombarded the Japan Ironworks and warehouses, along with nearby oil tanks and vessels, to great effect. This was the first naval bombardment of the Japanese mainland. Later, on 9 August 1945, the battleships &amp; heavy cruisers of the same group attacked Kamaishi again, this time joined by a small detachment of Royal Navy ships, most notably light cruisers HMS Newfoundland and HMNZS Gambia. 

The iron mill was also the site of the Sendai Prisoner of War Camp, and 32 Allied prisoners were killed in the raids. A total of 694 civilians and 30 Japanese military personnel were killed in the bombardment.

===Kamaishi after WWII===
Kamaishi played its part in Japan&#x27;s post-war boom, continuing its reputation as a steel town, a reputation reflected in the name of its rugby team - the Kamaishi Nippon Steel Rugby Club. In 1960, the town was crippled by a tsunami generated by the Great Chilean Earthquake. However, following the closure of the steel mills in 1988, the economy of the city collapsed, and almost half its population moved away. Kamaishi is now known more for commercial fishing than heavy industry. On September 30, 2010, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine used Kamaishi as an example of Japan&#x27;s relative decline in the Lost Decade.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami===
Kamaishi was heavily damaged by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, in which 1,250 city residents were killed or are missing; at least 4 of the town&#x27;s 69 designated evacuation sites and three of the town&#x27;s 14 schools were inundated. Of the 2,900 students who attended the town&#x27;s schools, five elementary or junior high school students were killed or are missing.

Tsunami waves as tall as surmounted the long and deep Kamaishi Tsunami Protection Breakwater, which had been completed in March 2009, after three decades of construction, at a cost of $1.5 billion. It was once recognized by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s deepest breakwater. The subsequent decision to rebuild the breakwater at a cost of over $650 million was criticised as &quot;a waste of money that aims to protect an area of rapidly declining population with technology that is a proven failure&quot;.

Numerous news videos were broadcast of the city, which can be recognized by a large green crane in the background and water rushing against tall buildings at the edge of the city.

==Government==
Kamaishi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 19 members. Kamaishi, together with the town of Ōtsuchi collectively contributes two seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Kamaishi was famous in modern times for its steel production, although after the closure of the blast furnace at Nippon Steel Kamaishi Iron and Steel Works and the scaling down of production in 1989, the local economy suffered greatly. The city has most recently made strong efforts towards promotion of eco-tourism. In 2015, the Hashino iron mining and smelting site was accepted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Sites of Japan&#x27;s Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining. Commercial fishing and shellfish production are also important economic activities.

==Education==
Kamaishi has nine public elementary schools, five public junior high schools operated by the city board of education, and three public high schools operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

==Sports==
Kamaishi was the home to one of Japan&#x27;s most successful rugby union clubs, Nippon Steel Kamaishi, which existed from 1959 to 2001 and won several national titles during the 1970s and 1980s. The club was succeeded by the modern Kamaishi Seawaves. As part of the post-disaster recovery of the region, Kamaishi hosted part of the 2019 Rugby World Cup at a new stadium holding 16,000 spectators.

Kamaishi won the &quot;Award for Character&quot; of the Rugby World Cup 2019 awards.

The city also has a semi-professional association football club, Nippon Steel Corp. Kamaishi S.C., which plays in the 5th division Tohoku Soccer League.

<text>was a city located in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. It is currently part of the city of Ōshū.

Esashi village was created within Esashi District on April 1, 1899 with the establishment of the municipalities system. On February 10, 1955, it annexed the neighboring town of Iwayado and the villages of Inase, Atago, Tahara, Hirose, Sunagawa, Tamasato, Fujisato, Yonesato and Ide to form Esashi town. Esashi was raised to city status on November 3, 1958.

On February 20, 2006, Esashi, along with the city of Mizusawa, the towns of Isawa and Maesawa, and the village of Koromogawa (all from Isawa District), was merged to create the city of Ōshū, and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

Its coastline forms part of the Sanriku Fukkō National Park, which stretches north to Aomori Prefecture. Ishinomaki includes Tashirojima (also known as &quot;Cat Island&quot;), Ajishima, and Kinkasan, three islands off the south coast of Oshika Peninsula.

===Neighboring municipalities===

*Higashimatsushima
*Minamisanriku
*Misato
*Onagawa
*Tome
*Wakuya

===Climate===
Ishinomaki has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in Ishinomaki is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around . Its record high is , reached on 15 August 2007, and its record low is , reached on 6 January 1919.


==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ishinomaki has declined over the past 40 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Ishinomaki was part of ancient Mutsu Province. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period. The town prospered as a major port and transshipment center for coastal shipping between Edo and northern Japan. The town of Ishinomaki was established within Oshika District on June 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

The city was founded on April 1, 1933. On April 1, 2005, Ishinomaki absorbed the neighboring towns of Kahoku, Kanan, Kitakami, Monou and Ogatsu, and the town of Oshika to more than quadruple its area and add nearly 60,000 people to its population.

The town of Ogatsu is regionally famous for its inkstones and has an annual scallop festival in the summer. Ayukawa, a town in Oshika, was formerly a base for several ships in Japan&#x27;s whaling fleet.

===2011 earthquake, tsunami, and subsidence===
Ishinomaki was among the municipalities most seriously affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Several tsunamis, up to about high, traveled inland up to from the coast. The tsunami destroyed around 80% of the 700 houses in the coastal port of Ayukawa, and the Kadonowaki neighborhood was largely leveled. Approximately 46% of the city was inundated by the tsunami. Following the tsunami, a &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; statue was found completely intact despite damage to the surrounding area; a writer for &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot; hoped that it would symbolically give hope to the survivors of the disaster.

Many public schools were completely destroyed, including , which lost 70 of 108 students and nine of 13 teachers and staff. There is still anger among some of the parents of the dead students because the teachers had wasted precious time in debating whether to evacuate to higher ground. And when the decision was finally made, the teachers had decided to get to higher ground further away from the school which necessitated crossing a nearby river bridge. It was here while crossing the bridge that both the teachers and students were swept away by the tsunami. This decision is deemed unreasonable by many of the parents because there is a hill right behind the school, which they could have reached quickly. One of the teachers had tried to persuade the other teachers to bring the students to safety uphill soon after the earthquake; when he was unsuccessful, he evacuated himself, managing to persuade one of the students to go with him - both survived. One of the teachers who survived the tsunami at the bridge later committed suicide.

Ishinomaki is the Japanese municipality with the highest confirmed death count. , a total of 3,097 deaths had been confirmed in Ishinomaki due to the tsunami, with 2,770 unaccounted for. Approximately 29,000 city residents lost their homes.

Ishinomaki employs several foreigners to teach English in all of its elementary and junior high schools, as well as the two municipal high schools. American teacher Taylor Anderson was killed by the tsunami. Since her death, her family has been active in supporting the Ishinomaki school district, and has set up programs to further English education.

The earthquake shifted the city southeast and downward, lowering it by as much as in some areas and causing it to flood twice daily at high tide. A once sandy beach in the Kadonowaki area completely disappeared and tides now reach the wall that once separated the beach from the road. Near the Mangakan Island, a walkway with benches was partially submerged in the river.

=== Rebuilding ===
Since 2011, Ishinomaki and other municipalities have been focusing on rebuilding and attracting residents back into the area. In 2019, eight years after the tragedy, Okawa Elementary School remains in ruins, as a memorial to those that were lost in the tsunami. Numerous parents who lost children due to staff errors sued the school and won in 2019.

Ishinomaki and other neighboring cities started construction on levees and large walls along the coast to protect against future tsunamis.

==Government==
Ishinomaki has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 30 members. Ishinomaki, together with the town of Onagawa, contributes five seats to the Miyagi Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Miyagi 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Ishinomaki traditionally has been a center for commercial fishing, especially for the cultivation of oysters.

<doc id="328224" wikidata="Q496448" url="?curid=328224" title="Shiogama">
<text>is a city located in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 52,662, and a population density of 3,032 persons per km² in 23,270 households. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Shiogama is in north-central Miyagi Prefecture, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east.

===Neighboring municipalities===
*Miyagi Prefecture
**Rifu
**Shichigahama
**Tagajō

===Climate===
Shiogama has a humid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in Shiogama is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shiogama peaked around 1990 and has declined since.
==Etymology==
&quot;Shiogama&quot; means &quot;salt furnace&quot; and refers to a local Shinto ritual involving the making of salt from sea water, still performed every July. The name is sometimes written using the &quot;kanji&quot; 塩釜 rather than 塩竈 and both spellings are officially permitted. Both 釜 and 竈 are pronounced &quot;gama&quot; in compounds, but as lone words they are pronounced &quot;kama&quot; and &quot;kamado&quot;, respectively. A &quot;kamado&quot; (竈, &quot;furnace&quot;) is what a &quot;kama&quot; (釜, &quot;kettle&quot;) is placed upon, and so the two are not completely interchangeable. 塩竈 is the form officially used by the city, but for ease of writing, the 10-stroke 釜 is often used in place of the 21-stroke 竈, such as in Shiogama Station.

Shiogama Jinja uses the rendering 鹽竈, with an archaic character for salt. This third form is rarely seen outside of this context.

==History==
The area of present-day Shiogama was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period by the Emishi people. During the Nara period, the area came under the control of colonists from the imperial dynasty based at nearby Tagajō and was the most important seaport in Mutsu. The ruins of the provincial capital of Mutsu Province have been found within the city borders. During later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate.

The town of Shiogama was established with the post-Meiji restoration creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Parts of Tagajō and Shichigahama were incorporated into Shiogama of September 1, 1938. Shiogama was raised to city status on November 23, 1941 (187th, nationally; 3rd in Miyagi). The city annexed the Gyūchi area of neighboring Tagajō on December 1, 1949 and the village of Urato on April 1, 1950.

The city was affected by the tsunami caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, although damage to its fishing industry turned out to be light.

<doc id="328225" wikidata="Q1137465" url="?curid=328225" title="Fukuoka Airport">
<text>— formerly known as Itazuke Air Base — is an international airport located east of Hakata Station in Hakata-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. The facility has one runway and covers 355 hectares (877 acres) of land.

Fukuoka Airport is the principal airport on the island of Kyushu and is the fourth busiest passenger airport in Japan, serving 25 million passengers in 2018. As of 2017, the airport is the fourth busiest single-runway airport in the world by passenger traffic (after Mumbai, London–Gatwick and İstanbul-Sabiha Gökçen). The airport is surrounded by residential areas and subject to a curfew from 22:00 every night to 07:00 the following morning, at the request of local residents. The domestic terminal boasts extensive facilities, but the international terminal is located on the other side of the runway.
The domestic terminal is connected to the city by the Fukuoka City Subway, and a subway from the airport to the business district takes about ten minutes. The international terminal is only accessible by road, although there is scheduled bus service to Hakata Station and the Tenjin area. As for access to the Fukuoka area, there are airports such as Saga Airport and Kitakyushu Airport, built on an artificial island and therefore open 24 hours a day, as alternatives to Fukuoka Airport, which is chronically congested. 
Fukuoka Airport is aggressively building a second runway and expanding two terminals in an effort to ease congestion.

Fukuoka Airport is ranked 26th in Skytrax’s World&#x27;s Top 100 Airports for 2024 and the 2nd in the World&#x27;s Best Regional Airports.

==History==
The airport was built in 1944 by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force as Mushiroda Airfield. After the war, the United States Air Force used the airfield as Itazuke Air Base from 1945 to 1972. Itazuke actually comprised three installations: Itazuke AB, Itazuke (Kasuga) Administration Annex and Brady Air Base (Camp Brady). Itazuke and the Kasuga Annex were on the mainland while Brady was in Saitozaki, on the peninsula (Umi no Nakamichi) that forms Hakata Bay. Part of the confusion with the names stem from the days when the annex and Brady AB were Army installations before the USAF took command in 1956.

At its height, Itazuke AB was the largest USAF base on Kyūshū, but was closed in 1972 due to budget reductions and the overall reduction of United States military forces in Japan.

===Japanese military base===

Mushiroda was constructed in 1943 by American and Allied POWs on former rice farmland. Initially used by trainer aircraft, the airfield soon became unsuitable due to the high water levels of the old rice fields, as frequent rains flooded the runway, making it unsafe for inexperienced pilots.

The Japanese Air Force&#x27;s 6th Fighter Wing replaced the trainers and Mushiroda became an air defense base. The 6th Wing had 30 single engine fighters and several reconnaissance aircraft to patrol the Okinawa-Kyūshū aerial invasion corridor. In April 1945, the Tachiarai Airfield near Kurume was destroyed by American B-29s. Tachiarai&#x27;s bomber aircraft were moved to Mushiroda and the base became very active until late in the war when B-29s attacked the airfield and destroyed most of the Imperial Japanese forces stationed here.

===Postwar era===

The first American units moved into the facility in November 1945, when the 38th Bombardment Group stationed B-25 Mitchells on the airfield. Moving to Itazuke from Yontan Airfield, Okinawa, the mission of the 38th Bomb Group was to fly daily surveillance missions to monitor shipping traffic between Kyūshū and Korea in order to intradict smuggling of illegal Korean immigrants and goods. Along with the 38th, the 8th Fighter Group was assigned to the airfield on 1 April 1946 which performed occupation duties until April 1947. Due to the massive destruction of the facility during the War, the only available buildings to house personnel was the Kyūshū Airplane Company&#x27;s complex in Zasshonokuma. Designated Base Two, the former aircraft company was converted to barracks, dining halls, a post exchange, and BOQ. Additional facilities and billets were housed in a tent city at the airfield.

The 38th Bomb Group remained at Itazuke until October 1946 also during with time several reconstruction units worked on the former IJAAF base rebuilding and constructing new facilities. Headquarters, 315th Bombardment Wing moved into the base during May 1946, spending most of the postwar occupation years at the new American Air Force base.

When the 38th Bomb Group moved to Itami Airfield, it was replaced by the P-61 Black Widow-equipped 347th Fighter Group that moved from Nagoya Airfield. The 347th&#x27;s mission was to provide air defense of Japanese airspace with the long range former night fighter. the 347th Fighter Wing, All Weather, was established at Itazuke in August 1948 when the unit was reformed under the new United States Air Force &quot;Base-Wing&quot; reorganization. The 347th moved to Bofu Air Base in October. It was replaced by the 475th Fighter Wing which brought with it the new F-82 Twin Mustangs, replacing the wartime Black Widows for air defense missions. Once up to full strength, it was moved to Ashiya Airfield in March 1949.

By early 1949, reconstruction of Itazuke was complete along the construction of long jet runways. The 8th Fighter Wing moved in during March with the F-80C Shooting Star jet, which provided air interceptor defense of Japan.

===Korean War===
Itazuke played a key role in the Korean War and the defense of the Pusan perimeter in 1950.

On 25 June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting a war that would last three years. Being the closest USAF base to the Korean Peninsula, the 8th Fighter Wing at Itazuke initially provided air cover for the evacuation of Americans from Korea on 26 June, the day after the invasion. In these early operations, Itazuke Air Base supported F-80C Shooting Star jet fighters of the 8th Fighter Wing, along with propeller driven aircraft such as the F-82C Twin Mustangs of the 68th Fighter Squadron, All Weather, and P-51D Mustangs which were shipped from the United States for ground support missions in South Korea. The first aerial victory of the Korean War went to 1Lt William G. Hudson, of the 68th Fighter Squadron, All Weather in an F-82.

During the Korean War, Itazuke was a major combat airfield for the USAF. The 8th Fighter Wing moved to a forward base in South Korea in late Fall of 1950. With the move, the support element that remained at Itazuke was redesignated the 6160th Air Base Wing. The USAF moved several of its combat units to the base for operations over Korea, these being the 49th Fighter Group, the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing; the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing; the 452d Bombardment Wing; the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing and the Texas Air National Guard 136th Fighter Group. A wide variety of aircraft operated from the airfield from twin-engined B-26 Invader tactical bombers, F-80 Shooting Stars, F-84 Thunderjets, F-82 Twin Mustangs and F-94 Starfire jet interceptors.

===Cold War===
After the 1953 Armistice in Korea, the wartime combat units were slowly withdrawn back to the United States or reassigned to other airfields in Japan and South Korea. The base settled down to another era of peace to become the key base in the defense of Western Japan. The 8th Fighter Wing returned to Itazuke from its forward airfield at Suwon AB (K-13), South Korea in October 1954, being the host unit at the base for the next ten years.

During the 1950s, the 8 FW flew the F-86 Sabre for air defense of Japan and South Korea, being upgraded to the new F-100 Super Sabre in 1956. In 1961 the wing received Air Defense Command F-102 Delta Daggers, specifically designed for the air defense mission.

The 8 TFW was reassigned back to the United States in July 1964 to George AFB, California where it was equipped with the new F-4C Phantom II and eventually became a major USAF combat wing in Thailand during the Vietnam War. With the departure of the 8 TFW, the 348th Combat Support Group became the host unit at Itazuke, with the Pacific Air Forces 41st Air Division becoming the operational USAF unit at the base. During the 1960s and numerous rotational units from the United States deployed to the base. The F-105 Thunderchief-equipped 35th Tactical Fighter Squadron was the major flying organization until 1968, when it was moved to Thailand for combat operations over North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. During the Vietnam War, a detachment of the 552d Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing which operated C-121 Constellation AWACS aircraft operated from Itazuke, but the stable situation in South Korea led to the gradual phase down of the base and personnel were withdrawn for other duties.

On 2 June 1968, at 10:48pm, a USAF RF-4C Phantom jet, which had taken off from Itazuke, experienced engine trouble, and after the two crew members safely ejected, the jet crashed into the Large Computer Center building of the Hakozaki Campus of Kyushu University, located in the East Ward of Fukuoka City. The building had just been built, and personnel had not yet moved in, so there were no casualties on the ground. Occurring as it did at the start of the 1968–1969 Japanese university protests, the crash helped ignite large-scale demonstrations at the university. The early demonstrations included participation by the university president and faculty, calling for American military to be removed from the Itazuke Base, claiming that its presence in an urban area was a danger. At a 20 June Japan-U.S. Joint Committee meeting, the Japanese representatives proposed that the Itazuke Airfield be relocated, and the American representatives stated that it would consider moving to an alternative site. In time New Left student groups at Kyushu University took the demonstrations in more radical directions, building barricades on campus, fighting with each other, and disrupting or cancelling classes, the graduation ceremony, and entrance examinations. The wreckage of the Phantom jet was not removed until 5 January 1969. The demonstrations continued until 14 October 1969, when riot police entered the campus and tore down the barricades. 

In 1970 it was announced that Itazuke would be returned to Japanese control, and the USAF facilities were closed on 31 March 1972.

===Civilian usage===

Fukuoka&#x27;s first civilian air service was Japan Airlines&#x27; Fukuoka-Osaka-Tokyo service, which commenced in 1951. JAL introduced jet service on the Fukuoka-Tokyo route in 1961. The airport&#x27;s first international service was to nearby Busan, South Korea, beginning in 1965. Air Siam and Air France both began long-haul service to Fukuoka in 1975, but withdrew within two years.

In October 1998, Delta Air Lines started a non-stop flight between Fukuoka and its transpacific hub in Portland using a McDonnell Douglas MD-11. It dropped the route the following September due to a decline in the Japanese economy. Japan Airlines operated flights from Fukuoka to Hawaii until withdrawing in 2005. Delta launched service to Honolulu in 2011, which was successful beyond expectations, particularly due to the opening of the Kyushu Shinkansen which made it a convenient resort route offering for passengers from throughout Kyushu. This led to an increase of Delta&#x27;s frequencies in 2012, as well as Hawaiian Airlines offering a daily Fukuoka-Honolulu service.

In April 2013, KLM inaugurated a flight to Amsterdam aboard a Boeing 777. This was the first direct service between Fukuoka and Europe. KLM discontinued it in January 2016. Four months later, Finnair introduced seasonal flights to Helsinki. The airline utilised Airbus A330s on the route. The last flight took off in 2019; Finnair suspended the link because of the COVID-19 pandemic and because Russia closed its airspace to the airline after invading Ukraine.

==Future developments==

Although Fukuoka is known as one of the most convenient airports in Japan, it is constrained both by its inner-city location and by its single runway. The International Terminal was opened in 1999. Operations at the airport began to exceed its capacity of 145,000 annual flights in 2012, the year in which several new low-cost carriers began operation. The Japan Civil Aviation Bureau has announced that Fukuoka will be designated as a &quot;congested airport&quot; (IATA Level 3) from late March 2016, meaning that the airport will be subject to slot restrictions and operators will have to receive five-year permits from JCAB in order to operate at FUK.

With Fukuoka&#x27;s ambitions to become a hub for business and travel in East Asia, moving the airport further inland or to an offshore artificial island to accommodate increased traffic has been considered. However, the idea of a new airport in the sea off Shingu has been opposed by environmentalists. The Gan-no-su coastal area has also been mooted, and it was the site of an airfield in the 1940s, but similar environmental concerns exist there. There is some debate as to whether a new airport is really needed, given the cost, the environmental problems, and the available capacity at alternates Kitakyushu Airport and Saga Airport, though much more distant from the city center.

=== Second runway===
, the Japanese government was considering building a second parallel runway within the existing airfield at a cost of 180 billion yen, two-thirds of which would be borne by the national government and the remaining third of which would be borne by the local government by 2019. , FUK will follow the model of other airports nationwide and undergo privatization. 

===International terminal===
Construction to double the size of the international passenger terminal is scheduled for completion in March 2025. Prior to that, the transportation center, &quot;access hall&quot;, in the international terminal will be completed in November 2024. A new eight-storey car park was completed in January 2023. An airport bus-only road connecting the two terminals is scheduled to open in November 2024.

===Domestic terminal===
Construction of a complex with a huge shopping mall and a hotel at the domestic passenger terminal is scheduled for completion in 2026. To alleviate the serious parking shortage, another nine-story parking building was completed in April 2024.

==Airlines and destinations==

The following airlines operate scheduled passenger flights to and from Fukuoka:

* On 17 December 1989, a hijacked CAAC Flight 981 plane made an emergency landing at the airport. The suspect, a Chinese national, was extradited to China after being detained in Japan for four months. He was later tried there and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and an additional two years of disfranchisement on 18 July 1990.
* On 13 June 1996, a Garuda Indonesia DC-10-30, Flight 865, crashed on take-off, killing 3 passengers and injuring 18. The pilot appeared to hesitate about applying full throttle upon a single engine failure. The crash occurred within the airport perimeter when the aircraft was already airborne, nine feet off the ground.
* On 12 August 2005, operating on a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 suffered an explosive engine failure on take-off. The aircraft safely returned to the airport with no casualties on board, but several people on the ground suffered burns from touching fallen debris from the engine, and a car&#x27;s windshield was damaged.

<doc id="328228" wikidata="Q2378826" url="?curid=328228" title="Georgia Force">
<text>The Georgia Force was the name of three separate versions of Arena Football League (AFL) teams based in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area of Georgia, United States.

The first incarnation of the Force resulted from the relocation of the original Nashville Kats franchise in 2001 and beginning play in 2002 at Philips Arena in Atlanta, then relocated to The Arena at Gwinnett Center in Duluth, Georgia in 2003, then back to Philips Arena in 2005. Following the termination of operations of the Arena Football League on August 4, 2009, Georgia Force officials quickly followed with a release that indicated that they, too, were ceasing operations. The franchise was last owned by Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank.

In 2010, the Alabama Vipers announced they would leave Huntsville, and would move to suburban Atlanta as the second incarnation of the Force for the 2011 AFL season, once again playing home games at Arena at Gwinnett Center. That team was owned by Doug MacGregor and Donn Jennings. Following the 2012 season, the franchise folded citing, &quot;The market never responded to our extensive marketing and sales campaign,&quot; said team president Corey Remillard. &quot;With all of the outreach, marketing, community and public relations that we put forward, it would have been impossible to not know that we were playing here, and the city simply did not respond. Atlanta is simply not a football town.&quot;

In November 2023, a third incarnation of the Georgia Force was announced as a member of the reconstituted Arena Football League beginning play in 2024. This franchise was originally slated to play home games at the Georgia State Convocation Center in Atlanta, although this never came to fruition. Being unable to secure a home venue, the league scheduled the franchise as a traveling team playing every game in 2024 as a visitor. However, this was short-lived, as the Georgia Force folded in May 2024, just two weeks into the season.

==History==

===The original Nashville Kats===
The team began as the first Nashville Kats team from 1997 to 2001. The original Kats played in the Nashville Arena (later known as Gaylord Entertainment Center, now known as Bridgestone Arena) in downtown Nashville and were initially coached by Eddie Khayat in 1997 and 1998. Khayat was then succeeded by Pat Sperduto for the balance of the team&#x27;s time in Nashville. The Kats were the league&#x27;s &quot;Organization of the Year&quot; for their inaugural year of 1997, and were in the playoffs for every season of their relatively brief existence, even playing in the ArenaBowl each of their final two seasons, albeit losing both times they reached the AFL&#x27;s championship game.

Virgil Williams, an Atlanta businessman, purchased the franchise for nearly $10 million in December 2001, and moved the team to Atlanta after the team&#x27;s previous owners failed to negotiate a favorable lease with the arena&#x27;s primary tenant and manager, the National Hockey League&#x27;s Nashville Predators. The Kats would return to Nashville as an expansion team in 2005 (in a situation similar to the National Football League&#x27;s Cleveland Browns). The second Nashville Kats team would fold after a losing 2007 season.

===First Dispersal Draft===
* 1. OL/DL Mike Lawson- (Miami)-formerly Florida Bobcats
* 2. WR/DB Kusanti Abdul-Salaam - (UCLA)-formerly Oklahoma Wranglers
* 3. FB/DB Scott Byrd Johnson (Ole Miss)-formerly-Knoxville Nighthawks(PIFL)
* 4. OL/DL Marcus Keyes (North Alabama)-formerly- Florida Bobcats
* 5. DS Scotty Lundsey (Stephen F. Austin)-formerly-Houston Thunderbears
*6. DB Nate Jacks (University of Kansas)-formerly-Lincoln Capitols (NIFL)
===The original Georgia Force (2002–2009)===

The rechristened Force played the 2002 season at Philips Arena in downtown Atlanta - home to the Atlanta Thrashers and Atlanta Hawks. In 2003 and 2004, the team relocated to Duluth, a suburb of Atlanta, and the brand new Arena at Gwinnett Center. After the team&#x27;s sale to Falcons owner Arthur Blank, a strong supporter of the downtown area and economy, the team returned to Philips Arena in 2005.

The team name was chosen through a contest in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Anthony R Ward submitted the winning name.

Under Williams&#x27; three-year tenure as owner, the team made the playoffs one time in 2003. Upon selling the team to Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank in September 2004, it was announced that the franchise would return to the downtown Philips Arena for the 2005 season in response to fan desires as expressed in a poll. However, following the 2007 season, the Force announced they were returning to the Gwinnett Center in 2008 after signing a 10-year lease.

The Georgia Force&#x27;s strongest rival in the Arena Football League was the New Orleans VooDoo, owned by then New Orleans Saints owner, Tom Benson. The rivalry was a natural extension of the long-held Atlanta Falcons/New Orleans Saints rivalry.

The 2005 season was, by far, the most successful in team history. With new team management under Arthur Blank, and under the direction of head coach and Chicago Bears legend Doug Plank, season highlights included a conference-best 11–5 record, and undefeated home record (8–0), a division title, a National Conference Championship, and a trip to ArenaBowl XIX. They fell in the ArenaBowl to the Colorado Crush, 51–48. The team would also win back to back Southern Division titles in 2007 and 2008.

The Force&#x27;s official mascot used to be a high-tech runner named G-Force, but was later changed to a blue, cuddly monster named Blu.

===The second Georgia Force (2011–2012)===
The second incarnation of the Force relocated from Huntsville, Alabama, where they played one season in the first AFL revival as the Alabama Vipers, a former AF2 franchise. They played two seasons in Gwinnett County before folding a second time.

===The third Georgia Force (2024)===
In November 2023, the AFL announced the return of the Force franchise, this time as an expansion team under the ownership of Southern Indoor Sports Management Company with no ties to the first two franchises. They played at the Georgia State Convocation Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta. The Georgia Force quietly revealed that they would be coached by AFL Hall of Famer Durwood Roquemore for the 2024 AFL Season.

On May 10, 2024, Force quarterback Justin Arth, who had been financing some of the players&#x27; meals through his private coaching business, indicated that the Force had abruptly folded after two games and that his teammates were facing eviction by the end of the week, prompting him to launch a fundraising drive to pay for his teammates&#x27; return home. In an extended interview with Front Office Sports, Arth indicated that Roquemore informed the team on May 9 that the league had run out of money and was shutting down the team.

<doc id="328230" wikidata="Q3194211" url="?curid=328230" title="Nashville Kats">
<text>The Nashville Kats is the name of three separate Arena Football franchises. All of them located in Nashville, Tennessee with the current incarnation playing in Arena Football One at Nashville Municipal Auditorium.

The original incarnation of the Kats launched in 1997 and were the first tenant of Bridgestone Arena (then known as Nashville Arena). The Kats were first coached by Eddie Khayat, who won AFL Coach of the Year honors in 1997. After two seasons, Khayat was succeeded by Pat Sperduto, who coached the team to back-to-back appearances in ArenaBowl XIV and ArenaBowl XV. Despite on-field success, unfavorable lease conditions led to the sale of the team and relocation to Atlanta in December 2001, then becoming the original Georgia Force. The second incarnation of the Kats joined the league as an expansion team in 2005, again coached by Sperduto and again playing at Bridgestone Arena (during this period known as Gaylord Entertainment Center, briefly renamed Nashville Arena, and then named Sommet Center). This second incarnation played three seasons before folding in 2007. The third incarnation of the team, coached by Dean Cokinos, began play in 2024 at Nashville Municipal Auditorium. In 2025, they will become inaugural members of the newly-formed Arena Football One.

==History==

===Original Nashville Kats (1997–2001)===

The team began as the Nashville Kats in 1997. The franchise was that of charter Arena team the Denver Dynamite, which had not played since 1991. The original Kats played in the then-named Nashville Arena (AKA &quot;The Alley&quot;) in downtown Nashville. The team was named for the 1967 hit &quot;Nashville Cats&quot; by The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. The team&#x27;s logo featured an anthropomorphic tabby wearing a 1950s-style leather jacket, holding the neck of a guitar in one paw and juggling a football with the other.

The Kats were initially coached by Eddie Khayat in 1997 and 1998, with the assistance of future Washington Football Team coach Jay Gruden as offensive co-ordinator in his first-ever coaching position. Gruden then returned to active play with the Orlando Predators and assistant to his brother Jon, then head coach of the NFL Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which played in the AFL off-season. Khayat was succeeded as Kats&#x27; head coach by Pat Sperduto for the balance of the team&#x27;s time in Nashville (including the second incarnation of the team). The Kats were the league&#x27;s Organization of the Year for their inaugural year of 1997, and were in the playoffs for every season of their relatively brief existence. The team&#x27;s success in the playoffs led to consecutive appearances in the ArenaBowl (XIV and XV) each of the original team&#x27;s final two seasons, although they were unable to win the AFL&#x27;s championship in either appearance.

After being unable to reach favorable agreements with arena management which was controlled by the venue&#x27;s primary tenant, the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League, majority owner Mark Bloom sold the franchise in December 2001 to Virgil Williams, an Atlanta businessman, for nearly $10 million. The team&#x27;s departure from the Nashville market was not related to lack of success neither on the field, nor at the box office, where they were a superior draw to several ongoing Arena football teams, but rather their inability to negotiate a favorable lease with the Predators. Following the move to Atlanta, this team would be rechristened the Georgia Force. The Public Address Announcer for the Nashville Kats from 1999 to 2001 was Chip Hoback. Hoback went on to announce the Georgia Force games at the Gwinnett Center.

===The birth of the expansion Nashville Kats (2001–2005)===

Shortly after the original team&#x27;s departure from Nashville, Bud Adams, the owner of the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League, purchased the rights to an expansion franchise in Nashville (along with the Kats identity). Initially, Adams was unable to negotiate a lease with the Nashville Predators to return the team to then-Gaylord Entertainment Center (now called Bridgestone Arena and formerly Nashville Arena) on terms he deemed to be adequately favorable. Because Nashville Municipal Auditorium and Vanderbilt&#x27;s Memorial Gym, the only other sizable indoor venues in Nashville, were unsuitable for arena football (Municipal Auditorium&#x27;s floor was too small to contain the field of play as its ice hockey rink had always been of less-than-regulation size and Vanderbilt had a &quot;dry&quot; no-alcohol policy for on-campus athletic events), Adams explored the idea of building his own mid-size arena (roughly 10,000 seats) to host the Kats and compete with the Gaylord Entertainment Center for concerts and smaller sporting events. Ultimately, the Predators agreed to a deal with Adams during the summer of 2004. Following the new agreement, Adams announced that the expansion Kats would begin play for the 2005 season and would return to the arena the original team called home.

While the majority of the new team was owned by Adams, country music singer Tim McGraw was brought in as a minority investor. McGraw, his wife Faith Hill, and their children were often seen on the first row of sideline seats along the south endzone. As a tie-in with McGraw, the PA system played his hit &quot;I Like It, I Love It&quot; following a Kats touchdown.

===The new Kats take the field (2005–2007)===
The second incarnation of the Nashville Kats began play in 2005 at the then-Gaylord Entertainment Center, the home of the original Kats team. When the Kats were revived, they reclaimed the history of the original Kats from the Georgia Force. This was an arrangement similar to the one made in the NFL with the Cleveland Browns and in the CFL with the Montreal Alouettes. The revived logo was almost identical to the original logo. The noteworthy exceptions were the ball (which was drawn as the lighter colored, brown-with-blue-stripe ball used in the AFL at that time) and the color scheme of the logo, which was slightly modified to mirror the team colors of the Tennessee Titans. New team uniforms also adopted the Tennessee Titans color scheme, going from the dark blue/silver/white combination of the original team to a new scheme including &quot;Titans&quot; light blue/red/white. The new team also introduced a new in-arena mascot named Kool Kat, a cat clad in a jersey and shorts that often performed daredevil stunts during breaks in the game. Sperduto also returned as head coach.

The new Kats&#x27; first season started horrendously. After an opening victory on the road, it took until week 8 for the franchise to record another victory. But after that, the Kats won their next five games, and finished the season with a 6–9–1 record. The 41–41 tie at the Dallas Desperados on April 8 was only the second in AFL history, and prompted the League to change its overtime rules to eliminate ties before the start of the 2006 season.

Nashville finished the 2006 regular season with an 8–8 record; good enough to earn the team a playoff berth. The Kats lost in the opening round to the Chicago Rush.

The Kats finished the 2007 season with a 7–9 record and just missed the playoffs after a Utah Blaze win in the final week of the season. On October 10, 2007, after months of speculation, owner Bud Adams decided to shut down operations. While ticket sales had been good initially, the team struggled at the box office following its poor performance in the 2005 season (the first season of the revived team).

The team was not mentioned as a possible addition to the resurrected AFL in 2010, though fans have been clamoring for a return of the Kats in some form to the renamed Bridgestone Arena in Nashville.

In 2014, a new indoor football team began play at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium as the Nashville Venom in the Professional Indoor Football League, bringing the excitement of professional indoor football back to Music City. Although this team won the championship of its league in its initial season as a member, it vanished (along with the league as a whole) after the 2015 season.

===2024 revival===

On November 1, 2023, the revival of the Arena Football League announced the return of the Nashville Kats and new ownership structure. The team is co-owned by Tamara Dadd Alan, Founding Partner and CEO; Nancy Eckert, Founding Partner and COO/General Counsel; and Chuck McDowell, largest individual stakeholder and Chairman of the franchise. Jeff Fisher, former Tennessee Titans Head Coach, is a partner and President of Football Operations for the organization (also now-commissioner of the league). Sports talk host Greg Pogue also serves as Partner and Vice President of Community Relations. Longtime broadcaster Eli Gold, former voice of the original AFL for TNN and NBC Sports and also known as the former voice of the Alabama Crimson Tide and NASCAR, was named the new radio voice of the Kats. The team play at Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, with one game at F&amp;M Bank Arena in Clarksville. They made it to the semi-finals for ArenaBowl XXXIII, only to lose to the eventual champion Billings Outlaws 35-32.

====Move to Arena Football One====
On September 4, 2024, the Kats, along with the other seven surviving members of the collapsed AFL, joined the newly-formed Arena Football One. Jeff Fisher was named permanent commissioner of the new league while maintaining his position with the Kats. They will play in the East Division along with the Albany Firebirds and Orlando Predators. Shortly after switching leagues, head coach Dean Cokinos quietly left the team and was named head coach of the Berlin Thunder of the European League of Football. During the schedule revival, Jeff Fisher announced the search for a new head coach. On February 18, 2025, the Kats announced that former four-time ArenaBowl championship head coach Darren Arbet would become the team&#x27;s newest head coach.

====Lawsuit against chairman====
On October 18, 2024, Nashville Arena Sports, LLC, owners of the Kats, filed a lawsuit in Chancery Court For Davidson County, Tennessee, against chairman Chuck McDowell seeking an alleged delinquent payment which was loaned to the franchise. The suit alleged that McDowell failed to pay on a signed $2.5 million (USD) promissory note to the club. They are also seeking to have McDowell expelled from the franchise ownership group. Jeff Fisher announced that the team still plans to play in the league&#x27;s inaugural season with its current owners despite this latest legal challenge.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kesennuma has declined over the past 40 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Kesennuma was part of ancient Mutsu Province and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period by the Emishi people, as evidenced by numerous shell middens found in coastal areas. During the later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate. The town of Kesennuma was established on June 1, 1889 within Motoyoshi District, Miyagi with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

Kesennuma City was formed on June 1, 1953, when the town of Kesennuma annexed the neighboring town of Shishiori and village of Matsuiwa. On April 1, 1955, the city annexed the villages of Niitsuki, Hashikami and Oshima. On March 31, 2006, the town of Karakuwa and on September 1, 2009 the town of Motoyoshi (both from Motoyoshi District) were likewise incorporated into Kesennuma.

On March 11, 2011, large parts of the city were destroyed by the tsunami which followed the Tōhoku earthquake. The island of Ōshima and its 3,000 residents, included in the city limits, was isolated by the tsunami which damaged the ferry connections. After the tsunami, spilled fuel from the town&#x27;s fishing fleet caught fire and burned for four days. As of 22 April 2011, the city had confirmed 837 deaths with 1,196 missing.

In August 2013, residents decided to scrap a fishing boat - the &quot;Kyotoku Maru No 18&quot; - which was swept inland by a giant wave during the 2011 tsunami. There had been plans to preserve the boat as a monument, as it had become a symbol of the tsunami.

In 2014, Kesennuma was designated as Japan&#x27;s first &quot;slow town&quot;.

==Government==
Kesennuma has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 24 members. Kessenuma, together with Motoyoshi District contributes three seats to the Miyagi Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, after the abolishment of the Miyagi 6th district in 2022, the city is part of Miyagi 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==

Kesennuma relies on tourism and commercial fishing, the latter being what the city is known for, especially its shark, tuna, pacific saury and skipjack tuna production, keeping the fishing port very active. Prior to the 2011 disaster, the city was Japan&#x27;s busiest port for processing bonito and swordfish. Presently, fishing and associated industries account for 85% of jobs in the town.

==Education==
Kesennuma has 14 public elementary schools and eight junior high schools operated by the town government, and four public high schools operated by the Miyagi Prefectural Board of Education and one private high school. The prefectural government also operates one special educational school.

<doc id="328236" wikidata="Q2304286" url="?curid=328236" title="Orlando Predators">
<text>The Orlando Predators are a professional arena football team based in Orlando, Florida. The team is currently owned by John Cheney, and play its home games at Kia Center (formerly Amway Center).

The team was founded in as an expansion team of the original Arena Football League (AFL). The team advanced to the playoffs 19 consecutive seasons between and , becoming the ArenaBowl champions in 1998 and 2000 during that span. The team suspended operations after the 2016 season. The original owners of this team acquired the Predators&#x27; trademarks in late 2018 after the previous owner, David A. Siegel, allowed them to lapse. A new organization led by former Predator Kenny McEntyre launched a second incarnation of the team in the National Arena League for the 2019 season. They moved to the new Arena Football League (AFL) in 2024. Then in 2025, they became inaugural members of the newly-formed Arena Football One following the third AFL&#x27;s collapse.

==History==
===First incarnation (1991–2016)===
====Early years (1991–1997)====
There was interest in arena football in Orlando as early as 1987, with a group looking to place an AFL team in central Florida in time for the 1988 season. But more than three years would go by until the Orlando Predators franchise was finally secured by Davey Johnson, Tracy Allen and Mike McBath on February 14, 1991. The Preds began play that same year but missed the playoffs, the only time the club would do so until 2012. In just their second season in 1992, they advanced to ArenaBowl VI, only to fall to the Detroit Drive, who won their fourth title in five years. Annually among the league-leaders in attendance, they qualified for the playoffs in 18 consecutive seasons, the longest streak in the original AFL. One noted administrator for the Predators was Pro Football Hall of Fame lineman, Jack Youngblood, who came to the Predators in 1995 as vice-president and then later, president of the organization. He was with the team through the 1999 season.

====Gruden era / two titles in four years (1998–2008)====
For much of their existence in the original AFL, their head coach was Jay Gruden, younger brother of prominent National Football League coach Jon Gruden and who would go on to coach the NFL&#x27;s Washington Redskins. Jay Gruden was formerly an outstanding Arena Football quarterback, leading the Tampa Bay Storm to four ArenaBowl championships, and then served one year as offensive coordinator for the Nashville Kats prior to becoming head coach of the Predators. Jay was the first quarterback in the AFL Hall of Fame. Orlando won the ArenaBowl in 1998 and 2000 under Gruden&#x27;s coaching. He then attempted a comeback as a player, but subsequently returned to coaching following the death of his head coach replacement, Fran Papasedero, in a car accident.

The Predators were one of the premier franchises in the history of the original AFL, and had a rivalry with Tampa Bay, who moved to Tampa the same year the Predators formed. They met twice in the ArenaBowl, with Tampa Bay winning in 1995 and Orlando winning in 1998. The rivalry, nicknamed the &quot;War on I-4&quot; after the interstate that connects the two cities, intensified when Gruden took over as Orlando&#x27;s head coach.

Orlando and Tampa Bay each lasted longer in their markets than any other AFL franchise have, . The Predators were unique in that they had played in their previous venue, Amway Arena, for 18 seasons in the AFL, longer than any other team. Amway Arena was often nicknamed &quot;The Jungle&quot; during Predators games due to the hostile environment from the fans, harsh smoke that filled the arena during the players intro, and a Guns N&#x27; Roses song which &quot;welcomed&quot; other teams. They shared Amway Arena with the Orlando Magic of the NBA and the Orlando Titans of the NLL. The 2010 season was the Predators&#x27; 19th and final season at Amway Arena. The team moved to Amway Center, the new arena in Orlando, for the 2011 season. A Predators game was the final sporting event ever performed at Amway Arena. 

The team&#x27;s mascot was a monster-like human named &quot;Klaw&quot; who looked much like the alien (Predator) from the &quot;Predator&quot; films, with only different coloring.

The Predators played in the ArenaBowl a total of seven times. If the Pittsburgh Gladiators&#x27; two ArenaBowl games before they moved to Tampa Bay are included, the Storm was the only franchise that played in more (eight; six as the Storm).

During the 2007 season, the Predators inaugurated the &quot;Predator Fan Hall of Fame&quot;. The inaugural inductees were Nancy Morris and Richard Grabe. Morris, was a superfan for over 20 years, was known to most of the team and the front office as &quot;The PredMom&quot;, and was the president of the Orlando Predator In Your Face Fan Club. Grabe, who also was a superfan (starting in 1991), was the creator of the &quot;PredHeads&quot; that were seen being worn by a select group of fans that sat in section 113 of the old Amway Arena. They were also known for their tailgating parties on &quot;Predator Island&quot; (located in the northeast corner of lot 4 of the Centroplex). After moving to the new Amway Center, the majority of &quot;PredHeads&quot; sat in section 114, and tailgated under I-4 in lot 9.

====Revival of AFL (2010–2016)====

The Predators maintained their organization and web presence after the AFL suspended operations in August 2009. On September 28, 2009, the Predators announced their return to play for the 2010 season as a member of the new Arena Football 1 league, until that league purchased the AFL&#x27;s assets and assumed the AFL&#x27;s history. With Jay Gruden obligated to the UFL by his contract with the Tuskers, eventually becoming the team&#x27;s head coach, they hired former quarterback Pat O&#x27;Hara as their head coach for the 2010 season. When the schedule for the league&#x27;s season was announced on December 31, 2009, the Predators were slated to return to action on April 9, 2010. In the 2010 season, the Predators finished with an 8–8 record. They qualified for the playoffs, but lost the conference championship to the Tampa Bay Storm by a single point as a last-second field goal attempt was unsuccessful.

In 2011, the Predators finished the regular season 11–7, but fell to the Jacksonville Sharks in the conference semifinals by a score of 63–48.

With a 4–14 record in 2012 under first-year head coach Bret Munsey, the Predators missed the playoffs for the first time since their inaugural season in 1991. Following the end of the season, Munsey was released as head coach.

Under Doug Plank for the 2013 season, the Predators lost their first five games of the season. It was then that the team acquired veteran quarterback Aaron Garcia in a trade with the San Jose SaberCats. The Predators went on to win seven of their remaining thirteen games following the trade to finish the season with a 7–11 record, which was good enough to clinch a playoff berth. However, they were eliminated in the conference semifinals by the Philadelphia Soul. With two weeks remaining during the regular season, Brett Bouchy sold his controlling interest in the team to The Pearsall Holdings LP for an undisclosed amount. Plank retired following the season.

The Predators moved to CFE Arena on the campus of the University of Central Florida in 2014, after the Amway Center informed the team that they had defaulted on their lease for failing to meet attendance requirements. On December 25, 2013, the Predators announced that Rob Keefe would become the seventh coach in franchise history. In May 2014, it was announced that majority owner David Pearsall had sold the team to an undisclosed ownership group, but the team was taken over by the AFL. In July 2014, reports began to surface that David A. Siegel had purchased the franchise with the intent to move the team back into the Amway Center. On July 15, 2014, Siegel confirmed his purchase of the Predators.

On December 8, 2014, the Predators suspended head coach Rob Keefe with pay while an investigation was ongoing by the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Office into accusations of domestic violence. The charges were since dropped.

During the week of June 18, 2016, the entire Arena Football League, including the hometown Predators, displayed patches and stickers &quot;ORL&quot; as a remembrance of the victims killed in the Pulse Nightclub massacre.

On October 12, 2016, the Orlando Predators announced they had suspended operations due to the reduced number of teams in the AFL and other pending disagreements with the league.

===Second incarnation (2019–present)===
====NAL revival team (2019–2023)====
The relaunch of the Orlando Predators as a member of the National Arena League was announced in January 2019 and was owned by Kenny McEntyre and Nate Starling after acquiring the trademarks for the team in late 2018. McEntyre and inaugural head coach Doug Miller were both former players with the AFL incarnation of the team. In their inaugural 2019 season, the team finished with a 2–12 record and last place in the league. During the season, players claimed the team was poorly operated including failed payments and evictions from team housing.

Prior to the team&#x27;s second season, the ownership of the Predators were removed by the league and replaced by another local ownership group composed of co-owner Nate Starling and the Trideco family. The new ownership group brought in former AFL Predator Ben Bennett as head coach. The 2020 season never took place due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On May 21, 2021, the team announced the Trideco family&#x27;s minority ownership had been purchased by John Cheney, allowing the Trideco family to focus on launching the expansion Albany Empire. Under Bennett, the team went 4–4 and qualified for the playoffs for the first time. Bennett left the team following the season was replaced by Jeff Higgins.

On September 16, 2022, the Predators announced veteran player Herkie Walls as their new head coach. 

The team played four seasons in the NAL between 2019 and 2023.

====New AFL (2024)====
On July 18, 2023, the Predators announced that Nate Starling and Mike Kwarta had left the ownership group and co-owner John Cheney took sole ownership of the franchise. On the same day, Cheney announced of the team&#x27;s Facebook page that the team would be returning to the Arena Football League (AFL) that expects to re-launch in 2024. On September 25, 2023, at a press conference at Full Sail University, owner John Cheney announced the NAL Predators would join the third incarnation of the AFL. Former AFL Predator E.J. Burt was introduced as the head coach on November 6, 2023.

====Arena Football One (2025)====
On September 4, 2024, the Predators announced that they would be leaving the collapsed AFL and would join the newly-formed Arena Football One. They will play in the East Division along with the Albany Firebirds and Nashville Kats.

===Predator highlights===
The Predators made Arena Football League history in consecutive weeks during the 1992 season:
* On June 13, 1992, the team defeated the San Antonio Force 50–0. San Antonio kicker Matt Frantz missed six field goals. This is the first game shutout in the history of indoor football. Although there have been shutouts in af2 and other indoor football leagues, it proved to be the only shutout ever recorded in the original AFL.
* On Friday, June 19, 1992, in a Week 4 road game against the Detroit Drive, quarterback Ben Bennett and the Predators trailed 42–32 with only 49 seconds left. In a miraculous feat of strength, Wide receiver / Defensive back Barry Wagner would catch two touchdown passes, get two two-point conversions, recover an onside kick, and made a game-ending tackle. With a safety added in, Orlando would win, 50–49. The comeback would become known as &quot;The Miracle Minute&quot;. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this comeback ranked #1.

<doc id="328237" wikidata="Q8016028" url="?curid=328237" title="William Napier, 9th Lord Napier">
<text>William John Napier, 9th Lord Napier, Baron Napier () FRSE (13 October 1786 – 11 October 1834) was a British Royal Navy officer and trade envoy in China.

== Early life ==
Napier was born in Kinsale, Ireland, on 13 October 1786. He was the son of Francis Napier, 8th Lord Napier (1758–1823) and the father of Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier and 1st Baron Ettrick (1819–1898).

He enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1803 and served - with distinction - as a midshipman on HMS Defiance at the Battle of Trafalgar (1805). He later served as lieutenant under Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald.

== Career ==

In 1818 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir David Brewster, Sir George Steuart Mackenzie, and John Playfair.

A peer of Scotland, Lord Napier was an elected Scottish representative in the House of Lords from 1824 to 1832. In December 1833, upon the ending of British East India Company&#x27;s monopoly on trade in the Far East, he was appointed by Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston, a family friend of Napier, as the first Chief Superintendent of Trade at Canton (now Guangzhou), in China. The Second and Third Superintendents were John Francis Davis and Sir George Best Robinson, respectively. He arrived at Macau on 15July 1834 on board the East India Company frigate &quot;Andromache&quot;, and reached Canton ten days later, with the mission of expanding British trade into inner China. Lacking the necessary diplomatic and commercial experience, he was not successful in achieving the objective.

Having failed to secure a meeting with Lu Kun, the Governor-general of the Liangguang, because of Napier&#x27;s rigid demands contravening longstanding protocols, Napier&#x27;s frustration led to his favoring a military intervention as personal retribution. He sent the frigates &quot;Andromache&quot; and &quot;Imogene&quot; to Whampoa on 11 September, defying an edict issued by Lu Kun, in a &#x27;casualty-less&#x27; skirmish of cannon fire as the British warships breached defences at the Bocca Tigris. After a prolonged stalemate, Lord Napier, sapped by typhus, was forced to retire to Macau in September 1834, where he died of the fever on 11October. Originally buried in Macau, he was later exhumed for reburial at Ettrick in Scotland.

Napier was the first British representative to suggest seizing Hong Kong. In a dispatch to Lord Palmerston on 14 August 1834, he suggested a commercial treaty, backed by an armed force, be done to secure the rights and interests of European merchants in China. He recommended that a small British force &quot;should take possession of the Island of Hongkong, in the eastern entrance of the Canton River, which is admirably adapted for every purpose&quot;.

==Family==

Lord Napier married Elizabeth Cochrane-Johnstone (c. 1795–1883), daughter of Scottish adventurer Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone, in 1816; they had two sons and six daughters. His eldest son, Francis Napier, also entered diplomatic service and was promoted by Palmerston for the rest of his life.

== Honours ==
Following his death, 120 years later, the British Government placed a memorial to him before the Macao Customs Office. After being lost for a short time, it was moved to the Hong Kong Cemetery, and then to the Hong Kong Museum of History, where it now rests.

<doc id="328238" wikidata="Q463715" url="?curid=328238" title="Billy Sheehan">
<text>William Sheehan (born March 19, 1953) is an American musician known for playing bass guitar with acts such as Talas, Steve Vai, David Lee Roth, Mr. Big, Niacin, and The Winery Dogs. He is also known for his &quot;lead bass&quot; playing style, including the use of chording, two-handed tapping, &quot;three-finger picking&quot; technique and controlled feedback. Sheehan has been voted &quot;Best Rock Bass Player&quot; five times in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; readers&#x27; polls.

==Career==

===Early years===
Billy Sheehan&#x27;s first electric bass was a Hagström FB, which was soon joined by a Precision bass. After acquiring the Precision bass, he removed the frets from the Hagström. Over the years, he heavily modified the Precision bass as well, scalloping the five highest frets, adding a neck pickup and additional support for the bolt-on neck, which Sheehan considers the instrument&#x27;s greatest weakness. The neck pickup was added for what Sheehan referred to as &quot;super deep low end&quot; modelled after Paul Samwell-Smith of the Yardbirds and Mel Schacher of Grand Funk Railroad. The Gibson EB-0 type pickup in the neck and the original split-coil Precision bass pickup each have their own separate stereo output jacks on the bass itself, allowing for control of the tone via the bass. The Precision bass has since been retired, but Sheehan still affectionately refers to it as &quot;The Wife&quot;. Sheehan&#x27;s signature Yamaha Attitude bass is patterned after this instrument. Sheehan also uses two amps to achieve his signature tone, one with full distortion and high pass filtering to sound more guitar-like, and one super-clean for the low end of the neck pickup.

===Talas===
Sheehan&#x27;s first full-time band was Talas, a power trio with Dave Constantino on guitar and Paul Varga on drums. The band played a mixture of cover songs and original material, and all three instrumentalists alternated on lead vocals.

Talas was a popular local band in Buffalo for over a decade, attaining a cult status which spread into the northeast US and into Canada. In 1979, Talas released their eponymous debut album, which generated the regional hit single, &quot;See Saw&quot;. It was during this time that Sheehan wrote &quot;Shy Boy&quot; (later re-recorded with David Lee Roth), and &quot;Addicted to that Rush&quot; (later re-recorded with Mr Big).

In the late 1970s, Sheehan also played in a band called Light Years with drummer Ron Rocco who had earlier played in a band called Black Sheep with Foreigner singer Lou Gramm in Rochester, NY. After Sheehan returned to Talas they opened a show for UFO in Buffalo. This led Sheehan to an association with guitarist Michael Schenker and also helped land him the job touring with UFO in 1983.

Talas&#x27; first national exposure happened in 1980, when they opened thirty shows for Van Halen. However, success was elusive, and even as their brand of what came to be known as &quot;glam metal&quot; gained popularity over the next few years, Talas remained an unsigned act, partly due to poor management. They independently released their debut &quot;Talas&quot; LP on Evenfall Records (reissued by Metal Blade), and then &quot;Sink Your Teeth into That&quot; on Relativity Records.

Seeking to take Talas further than just regional success, Sheehan reformed Talas with another drummer (Mark Miller), guitarist (Mitch Perry, also later of Heaven), and a dedicated vocalist, Phil Naro, with whom in the late 1970s Sheehan had previously worked in his side project (the Billy Sheehan Band). Talas would release only one more album, Live Speed on Ice. After Mitch Perry left the band, he was replaced by Johnny Angel, who played guitar with them for their 1985/86 US tour opening for Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s Rising Force. There was a fourth Talas record, tentatively titled &quot;Lights, Camera, Action&quot; to be issued on Gold Mountain/A&amp;M, but it never got past the demo stage due to Sheehan leaving to join David Lee Roth&#x27;s solo band. Talas did briefly continue on under Phil Naro sans Sheehan, enlisting Jimmy DeGrasso on drums, Al Pitrelli on guitar, Bruno Ravel on bass and Gary Bivona on keyboards but by this time Talas was dead and Ravel formed Danger Danger. Sheehan also auditioned for Toronto based rock band Max Webster, being a long time friend of Max Webster singer/guitarist Kim Mitchell. 

In the early 1980s, Sheehan became involved with the proto-thrash metal band Thrasher, during this time he shared the stage with future Anthrax guitarist Dan Spitz. His involvement with Thrasher did not last long but he did play on the self-titled LP, reissued on CD in 2008.

===Niacin===
In 1996, Sheehan formed the jazz fusion band Niacin with drummer Dennis Chambers and keyboardist John Novello. The band&#x27;s name comes from the timbral foundation of the Hammond B3 organ (Vitamin B3 is also known as niacin).

Niacin released their first studio album in 1996. Their music is primarily instrumental, with the exception of their third studio album, &quot;Deep&quot; (2000), which features vocals by Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple. The album also includes guest guitar by Steve Lukather of Toto.

===The Winery Dogs and Sons of Apollo===
Sheehan toured with PSMS (Portnoy / Sheehan / MacAlpine / Sherinian), an instrumental supergroup, in the second half of 2012.

Sheehan, along with Portnoy and Richie Kotzen, recorded the debut album for their new band The Winery Dogs in August 2012. The self-titled album was released in 2013. Their second album &quot;Hot Streak&quot; was released in 2015.

In August 2017, he joined another band with Portnoy, a progressive metal supergroup named Sons of Apollo and also featuring keyboardist Derek Sherinian, vocalist Jeff Scott Soto and guitarist Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal.

==Personal life==
Sheehan has been an active member of the Church of Scientology since 1971, having converted from Catholicism. Sheehan and his wife, Elisabetta, live in Nashville, TN.

<text>Marketing strategy refers to efforts undertaken by an organization to increase its sales and achieve competitive advantage. In other words, it is the method of advertising a company&#x27;s products to the public through an established plan through the meticulous planning and organization of ideas, data, and information.

Strategic marketing emerged in the 1970s and 1980s as a distinct field of study, branching out of strategic management. Marketing strategies concern the link between the organization and its customers, and how best to leverage resources within an organization to achieve a competitive advantage. In recent years, the advent of digital marketing has revolutionized strategic marketing practices, introducing new avenues for customer engagement and data-driven decision-making.

==Marketing management versus marketing strategy==

The terms “strategic” and “managerial” marketing distinguish between two processes, each with different goals and conceptual tools. Strategic marketing involves implementing policies that boost a business’s competitive position while addressing challenges and opportunities in the industry. Managerial marketing involves executing specific and targeted objectives.

Marketing strategy allows a firm to narrow down its visions into practical and achievable goals while Marketing management involves practical planning to implement these goals. The term higher-order planning is often used to refer to marketing strategy since this strategy helps establish the general direction for the firm while providing a structure for the marketing program.

Marketing Management is a combined effort of strategies on how a business can launch its products and services. On the other hand, Marketing strategy is the combination of many processes where the business owner or marketer can attract potential customers via several channels. It can be through offline channels or online channels. 

Marketing Strategy Examples – 
* Pricing Strategy
* Customer Service process
* GTM (Go-To-Market) Strategy
* Packaging
* Market Mapping and Distribution Reach
* Channel Management
* Budgeting

Marketing Management Examples – 
* Launch &amp; Promotion
* Launch Mode – Offline &amp; Online
* Campaign Management
* Budget for the promotional plan
* Advertisement Strategy

These are a few examples to understand the basics.

==History==

Marketing scholars have suggested that strategic marketing arose in the late 1970s and its origins can be understood in terms of a distinct evolutionary path:

: Budgeting Control (also known as &quot;scientific management&quot;)

: Date: From the late 19th century
: Key Thinkers: Frederick Winslow Taylor, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, Henry L. Gantt, Harrington Emerson 
: Key Ideas: Emphasis on quantification and scientific modeling, reduce work to the smallest possible units and assign work to specialists, exercise control through rigid managerial hierarchies, standardize inputs to reduce variation, and defects and control costs, use quantitative forecasting methods to predict any changes.

:Long-range Planning
: Date: From the 1950s
: Key Thinkers: Herbert A. Simon 
: Key Ideas: The managerial focus was to anticipate growth and manage operations in an increasingly complex business world.

:Strategic Planning (also known as &quot;corporate planning&quot;)
:Date: From the 1960s
: Key Thinkers: Michael Porter 
: Key Ideas: Organizations must find the right fit within an industry structure; advantage derives from industry concentration and market power; firms should strive to achieve a monopoly or quasi-monopoly; successful firms should be able to erect barriers to entry.

: Strategic Marketing Management A business&#x27;s overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of the products or services the business provides.
: Date: from the late 1970s 
: Key thinkers: R. Buzzell and B. Gale
: Key Ideas: Each business is unique and there can be no formula for achieving competitive advantage; firms should adopt a flexible planning and review process that aims to cope with strategic surprises and rapidly developing threats; management&#x27;s focus is on how to deliver superior customer value; highlights the key role of marketing as the link between customers and the organization.

: Resource-based view (also known as &quot;resource-advantage theory&quot;)
: Date: From the mid-1990s
: Key Thinkers: Jay B. Barney, George S. Day, Gary Hamel, Shelby D. Hunt, G. Hooley and C.K. Prahalad
: Key Ideas: The firm&#x27;s resources are financial, legal, human, organizational, informational, and relational; resources are heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile, management&#x27;s key task is to understand and organize resources for sustainable competitive advantage.

==Overview==
Marketing strategy involves mapping out the company&#x27;s direction for the forthcoming planning period, whether that be three, five, or ten years. It involves undertaking a 360° review of the firm and its operating environment to identify new business opportunities that the firm could potentially leverage for competitive advantage. Strategic planning can also reveal market threats that the firm may need to consider for long-term sustainability. Strategic planning makes no assumptions about the firm continuing to offer the same products to the same customers in the future. Instead, it is concerned with identifying the business opportunities that are likely to be successful and evaluating the firm&#x27;s capacity to leverage such opportunities. It seeks to identify the &quot;strategic gap&quot;, which is the difference between where a firm is currently situated (the &quot;strategic reality&quot; or &quot;inadvertent strategy&quot;) and where it should be situated for sustainable, long-term growth (the &quot;strategic intent&quot; or &quot;deliberate strategy&quot;).

Strategic planning seeks to address three deceptively simple questions, specifically:

* Where are we now? (Situation analysis)
* What business &quot;should&quot; we be in? (Vision and mission)
* How should we get there? (Strategies, plans, goals, and objectives)

A fourth question may be added to the list, namely &#x27;How do we know when we got there?&#x27; Due to the increasing need for accountability, many marketing organizations use a variety of metrics to track strategic performance, allowing for corrective action to be taken as required. On the surface, strategic planning seeks to address three simple questions, however, the research and analysis involved in strategic planning are very sophisticated and require a great deal of skill and judgment.

== Tools and techniques==

Strategic analysis is designed to address the first strategic question, &quot;Where are we now?&quot; Traditional market research is less useful for strategic marketing because the analyst is not seeking insights about customer attitudes and preferences. Instead, strategic analysts are seeking insights into the firm&#x27;s operating environment to identify possible future scenarios, opportunities, and threats.

Mintzberg suggests that the top planners spend most of their time engaged in analysis and are concerned with industry or competitive analyses as well as internal studies, including the use of computer models to analyze trends in the organization. Strategic planners use a variety of research tools and analytical techniques, depending on the environment complexity and the firm&#x27;s goals. Fletcher and Bensoussan, for instance, have identified some 200 qualitative and quantitative analytical techniques regularly used by strategic analysts while a recent publication suggests that 72 techniques are essential. No optimal technique can be identified as useful across all situations or problems. Determining which technique to use in any given situation rests with the analyst&#x27;s skills. The choice of tool depends on a variety of factors including: data availability; the nature of the marketing problem; the objective or purpose, the analyst&#x27;s skill level as well as other constraints such as time or motivation.

The most commonly used tools and techniques include:

Research methods
* Environmental scanning
* Marketing intelligence (also known as competitive intelligence)
* Futures research

Analytical techniques
* Brand Development Index (BDI)/ Category development index (CDI)
* Brand/ Category penetration 
* Benchmarking
* Blind spots analysis
* Functional capability and resource analysis
* Impact analysis
* Counterfactual analysis
* Demand analysis
* Emerging Issues Analysis
* Experience curve analysis
* Gap analysis
* Herfindahl index
* Industry Analysis (also known as Porter&#x27;s five forces analysis)
* Management profiling
* Market segmentation analysis
* Market share analysis
* Perceptual mapping
* PEST analysis and its variants including PESTLE, STEEPLED and STEER (PEST is occasionally known as Six Segment Analysis)
* Portfolio analysis, such as BCG growth-share matrix or GE business screen matrix 
* Precursor Analysis or Evolutionary analysis
* Product life cycle analysis and S-curve analysis (also known as technology life cycle or hype cycle analysis)
* Product evolutionary cycle analysis

==Vision and mission statements==

The vision and mission address the second central question, &#x27;Where are we going?&#x27; At the conclusion of the research and analysis stage, the firm will typically review its vision statement, mission statement and, if necessary, devise a new vision and mission for the outlook period. At this stage, the firm will also devise a generic competitive strategy as the basis for maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage for the forthcoming planning period.

A vision statement is a realistic, long-term future scenario for the organization. (Vision statements should not be confused with slogans or mottos.) It is a &quot;clearly articulated statement of the business scope.&quot; A strong vision statement typically includes the following:

* Competitive scope
* Market scope
* Geographic scope
* Vertical scope

Some scholars point out the market visioning is a skill or competency that encapsulates the planners&#x27; capacity &quot;to link advanced technologies to market opportunities of the future, and to do so through a shared understanding of a given product market.

A mission statement is a clear and concise statement of the organization&#x27;s reason for being and its scope of operations, while the generic strategy outlines how the company intends to achieve both its vision and mission.

Mission statements should include detailed information and must be more than a simple &quot;motherhood statement&quot;. A mission statement typically includes the following:
* Specification of target customers 
* Identification of principal products or services offered
* Specification of the geographic scope of operations
* Identification of core technologies or core capabilities
* An outline of the firm&#x27;s commitment to long-term survival, growth and profitability
* An outline of the key elements in the company&#x27;s philosophy and core values
* Identification of the company&#x27;s desired public image

==Generic competitive strategy==

The generic competitive strategy outlines the fundamental basis for obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage within a category. Firms can normally trace their competitive position to one of three factors:

* Superior skills (e.g. coordination of individual specialists, created through the interplay of investment in training and professional development, work and learning) 
* Superior resources (e.g. patents, trade-mark protection, specialized physical assets and relationships with suppliers and distribution infrastructure.) 
* Superior position (the products or services offered, the market segments served, and the extent to which the product-market can be isolated from direct competition.)

It is essential that the internal analysis provide a frank and open evaluation of the firm&#x27;s superiority in terms of skills, resources or market position since this will provide the basis for competing over the forthcoming planning period. For this reason, some companies engage external consultants, often advertising or marketing agencies, to provide an independent assessment of the firm&#x27;s capabilities and resources.

== Ethnic Marketing Strategy ==
There is one strategy that is at times weaved into marketing strategies, however not explicitly stated. And it is unethical in that it specifically targets unsuspecting minority groups. First, consider the definition of ethics, which is the moral question of whether or not something is socially acceptable. Applying this definition to marketing strategy, companies must be wary that they do not purposefully seek to seclude groups of people based on their cultural background. A company that is seeking to expand internationally has a duty to establish their marketing agenda with multiple cultures in mind, so as to prevent bodies of people from getting left out. Marketing strategies have two goals: first of which, keeping with company&#x27;s goals, is to benefit in some way consumers on a micro level from person to person and then second, keep all of society as a whole in contentment.

===Porter approach===

In 1980, Michael Porter developed an approach to strategy formulation that proved to be extremely popular with both scholars and practitioners. The approach became known as the &quot;positioning school&quot; because of its emphasis on locating a defensible &quot;competitive position&quot; within an industry or sector. In this approach, strategy formulation consists of three key strands of thinking: analysis of the five forces to determine the sources of competitive advantage; the selection of one of three possible positions which leverage the advantage and the value chain to implement the strategy. In this approach, the strategic choices involve decisions about whether to compete for a share of the total market or for a specific target group (competitive scope) and whether to compete on costs or product differences (competitive advantage). This type of thinking leads to three generic strategies:

* Cost leadership – the firm targets the mass market and attempts to be the lowest-cost producer in the market
* Differentiation – the firm targets the mass market and tries to maintain unique points of product difference perceived as desirable by customers and for which they are prepared to pay premium prices
* Focus – the firm does not compete for head to head, but instead selects a narrow target market and focuses its efforts on satisfying the needs of that segment

According to Porter, these strategies are mutually exclusive and the firm must select one approach to the exclusion of all others. Firms that try to be all things to all people can present a confusing market position which ultimately leads to below-average returns. Any ambiguity about the firm&#x27;s approach is a recipe for &quot;strategic mediocrity&quot; and any firm that tries to pursue two approaches simultaneously is said to be &quot;stuck in the middle&quot; and destined for failure.

Porter&#x27;s approach was the dominant paradigm throughout the 1980s, allowing others who sought to formulate strategy within their business model to follow his (at the time) best division of the ways in which to target the market. This only lasted a little while though, as Porter&#x27;s approach began receiving a good amount of criticism mainly due to its simplicity; which is part of what made his approach so popular. One important criticism is that it is possible to identify successful companies that pursue a hybrid strategy – such as low-cost positions and differentiated positions simultaneously. Toyota is a classic example of this hybrid approach. Other scholars point to the simplistic nature of the analysis and the overly prescriptive nature of the strategic choices which limits strategies to just three options. Yet others point to research showing that many practitioners find the approach to be overly theoretical and not applicable to their business.

===Resource-based view (RBV) ===
During the 1990s, the &quot;resource-based view&quot; (also known as the &quot;resource-advantage theory&quot;) of the firm became the dominant paradigm. It is an interdisciplinary approach that represents a substantial shift in thinking. It focuses attention on an organization&#x27;s internal resources as a means of organizing processes and obtaining a competitive advantage. The resource-based view suggests that organizations must develop unique, firm-specific core competencies that will allow them to outperform competitors by doing things differently and in a superior manner.

Barney stated that for resources to hold potential as sources of sustainable competitive advantage, they should be valuable, rare, and imperfectly imitable. A key insight arising from the resource-based view is that not all resources are of equal importance nor possess the potential to become a source of sustainable competitive advantage. The sustainability of any competitive advantage depends on the extent to which resources can be imitated or substituted. Barney and others point out that understanding the causal relationship between the sources of advantage and successful strategies can be very difficult in practice. Barney calls the situation where there is a connection to a firm&#x27;s organized materials and when their continued competitive advantage is only partially comprehended as &quot;casually ambiguous&quot;. Thus, a great deal of managerial effort must be invested in identifying, understanding, and classifying core competencies. In addition, management must invest in organizational learning to develop and maintain key resources and competencies.

Market Based Resources include:

* Organizational culture e.g. market orientation, research orientation, culture of innovation, etc.
* Assets e.g. brands, Mktg IS, databases, etc.
* Capabilities (or competencies) e.g. market sensing, marketing research, relationships, know-how, tacit knowledge, etc.

After more than two decades of advancements in marketing strategy and in the resource-based view paradigm, Cacciolatti &amp; Lee (2016) proposed a novel resource-advantage theory based framework that builds on those organizational capabilities that are relevant to marketing strategy and shows how they have an effect on firm performance. The capabilities-performance model proposed by Cacciolatti &amp; Lee (2016) illustrates the mechanism whereby market orientation, strategic orientation, and organizational power moderate the capabilities-performance relationship. Such a logic of analysis was implicit in the original formulation of RA theory and although it was taken into consideration by several scholars, it has never been articulated explicitly and tested empirically.

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organizations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter&#x27;s prescriptive approach to strategy formulation.

Hooley et al., suggest the following classification of competitive positions:

* Price positioning
* Quality positioning
* Innovation positioning
* Service positioning
* Benefit positioning
* Tailored positioning (one-to-one marketing)

===Other approaches===

The choice of competitive strategy often depends on a variety of factors including: the firm&#x27;s market position relative to rival firms, the stage of the product life cycle. A well-established firm in a mature market will likely have a different strategy than a start-up.

====Growth strategies====

Growth of a business is critical for business success. A firm may grow by developing the market or by developing new products. The Ansoff product and market growth matrix illustrates the two broad dimensions for achieving growth. The Ansoff matrix identifies four specific growth strategies: market penetration, product development, market development and diversification. 
:&quot;Market penetration&quot; involves selling existing products to existing consumers. This is a conservative, low risk approach since the product is already on the established market. 
: &quot;Product development&quot; is the introduction of a new product to existing customers. This can include modifications to an already existing market which can create a product that has more appeal. 
:&quot;Market development&quot; involves the selling of existing products to new customers in order to identify and build a new clientele base. This can include new geographical markets, new distribution channels, and different pricing policies that bring the product price within the competence of new market segments. 
:&quot;Diversification&quot; is the riskiest area for a business. This is where a new product is sold to a new market. There are two type of Diversification; horizontal and vertical. &quot;Horizontal diversification&quot; focuses more on the product(s) where the business is knowledgeable, whereas &quot;vertical diversification&quot; focuses more on the introduction of new product into new markets, where the business could have less knowledge of the new market.

; Horizontal integration
A horizontal integration strategy may be indicated in fast-changing work environments as well as providing a broad knowledge base for the business and employees. A benefit of horizontal diversification is that it is an open platform for a business to expand and build away from the already existing market.

High levels of horizontal integration lead to high levels of communication within the business. Another benefit of using this strategy is that it leads to a larger market for merged businesses, and it is easier to build good reputations for a business when using this strategy. A disadvantage of using a diversification strategy is that the benefits could take a while to start showing, which could lead the business to believe that the strategy in ineffective. Another disadvantage or risk is, it has been shown that using the horizontal diversification method has become harmful for stock value, but using the vertical diversification had the best effects.

A disadvantage of using the horizontal integration strategy is that this limits and restricts the field of interest that the business. Horizontal integration can affect a business&#x27;s reputation, especially after a merge has happened between two or more businesses. There are three main benefits to a business&#x27;s reputation after a merge. A larger business helps the reputation and increases the severity of the punishment. As well as the merge of information after a merge has happened, this increases the knowledge of the business and marketing area they are focused on. The last benefit is more opportunities for deviation to occur in merged businesses rather than independent businesses.

; Vertical integration
Vertical integration is when business is expanded through the vertical production line on one business. An example of a vertically integrated business could be Apple. Apple owns all their own software, hardware, designs and operating systems instead of relying on other businesses to supply these. By having a highly vertically integrated business this creates different economies therefore creating a positive performance for the business. Vertical integration is seen as a business controlling the inputs of supplies and outputs of products as well as the distribution of the final product. Some benefits of using a Vertical integration strategy is that costs may be reduced because of the reducing transaction costs which include finding, selling, monitoring, contracting and negotiating with other firms. Also by decreasing outside businesses input it will increase the efficient use of inputs into the business. Another benefit of vertical integration is that it improves the exchange of information through the different stages of the production line. Some competitive advantages could include; avoiding foreclosures, improving the business marketing intelligence, and opens up opportunities to create different products for the market. Some disadvantages of using a Vertical Integration Strategy include the internal costs for the business and the need for overhead costs. Also if the business is not well organized and fully equipped and prepared the business will struggle using this strategy. There are also competitive disadvantages as well, which include; creates barriers for the business, and loses access to information from suppliers and distributors.

====Market position and strategy====
In terms of market position, firms may be classified as market leaders, market challengers, market followers or market nichers.
: &quot;Market leader&quot;: The market leader dominates the market by objective measure of market share. Their overall posture is defensive because they have more to lose. Their objectives are to reinforce their prominent position through the use of PR to develop corporate image and to block competitors brand for brand, matching distribution through tactics such as the use of &quot;fighting&quot; brands, pre-emptive strikes, use of regulation to block competitors and even to spread rumours about competitors. Market leaders may adopt unconventional or unexpected approaches to building growth and their tactical responses are likely to include: product proliferation; diversification; multi-branding; erecting barriers to entry; vertical and horizontal integration and corporate acquisitions.
: &quot;Market challenger&quot;: The market challenger holds the second highest market share in the category, following closely behind the dominant player. Their market posture is generally offensive because they have less to lose and more to gain by taking risks. They will compete head to head with the market leader in an effort to grow market share. Their overall strategy is to gain market share through product, packaging and service innovations; new market development and redefinition of the product to broaden its scope and their position within it.
: &quot;Market follower&quot;: Followers are generally content to play second fiddle. They rarely invest in R &amp; D and tend to wait for market leaders to develop innovative products and subsequently adopt a “me-too” approach. Their market posture is typically neutral. Their strategy is to maintain their market position by maintaining existing customers and capturing a fair share of any new segments. They tend to maintain profits by controlling costs.
: &quot;Market nicher&quot;: The market nicher occupies a small niche in the market in order to avoid head to head competition. Their objective is to build strong ties with the customer base and develop strong loyalty with existing customers. Their market posture is generally neutral. Their strategy is to develop and build the segment and protect it from erosion. Tactically, nichers are likely to improve the product or service offering, leverage cross-selling opportunities, offer value for money and build relationships through superior after-direct sales service, service quality and other related value-adding activities.

Most firms carry out strategic planning every 3– 5 years and treat the process as a means of checking whether the company is on track to achieve its vision and mission. Ideally, strategies are both dynamic and interactive, partially planned and partially unplanned. Strategies are broad in their scope in order to enable a firm to react to unforeseen developments while trying to keep focused on a specific pathway. A key aspect of marketing strategy is to keep marketing consistent with a company&#x27;s overarching mission statement.

Strategies often specify how to adjust the marketing mix; firms can use tools such as Marketing Mix Modeling to help them decide how to allocate scarce resources, as well as how to allocate funds across a portfolio of brands. In addition, firms can conduct analyses of performance, customer analysis, competitor analysis, and target market analysis.

====Entry strategies====
Marketing strategies may differ depending on the unique situation of the individual business. According to Lieberman and Montgomery, every entrant into a market – whether it is new or not – is classified under a Market Pioneer, Close Follower or a Late follower

=====Pioneers=====

Market pioneers are known to often open a new market to consumers based on a major innovation. They emphasize these product developments, and in a significant number of cases, studies have shown that early entrants – or pioneers – into a market have serious market-share advantages above all those who enter later. Pioneers have the first-mover advantage, and in order to have this advantage, business’ must ensure they have at least one or more of three primary sources: Technological Leadership, Preemption of Assets or Buyer Switching Costs. Technological Leadership means gaining an advantage through either Research and Development or the “learning curve”. This lets a business use the research and development stage as a key point of selling due to primary research of a new or developed product. Preemption of Assets can help gain an advantage through acquiring scarce assets within a certain market, allowing the first-mover to be able to have control of existing assets rather than those that are created through new technology. Thus allowing pre-existing information to be used and a lower risk when first entering a new market. By being a first entrant, it is easy to avoid higher switching costs compared to later entrants. For example, those who enter later would have to invest more expenditure in order to encourage customers away from early entrants. However, while Market Pioneers may have the “highest probability of engaging in product development” and lower switching costs, to have the first-mover advantage, it can be more expensive due to product innovation being more costly than product imitation. It has been found that while Pioneers in both consumer goods and industrial markets have gained “significant sales advantages”, they incur larger disadvantages cost-wise.

=====Close followers=====

Being market pioneer can, more often than not, attract entrepreneurs or investors depending on the benefits of the market. If there is an upside potential and the ability to have a stable market share, many businesses would start to follow in the footsteps of these pioneers. These are more commonly known as Close Followers. These entrants into the market can also be seen as challengers to the Market Pioneers and the Late Followers. This is because early followers are more than likely to invest a significant amount in Product Research and Development than later entrants. By doing this, it allows businesses to find weaknesses in the products produced before, thus leading to improvements and expansion on the aforementioned product. Therefore, it could also lead to customer preference, which is essential in market success. Due to the nature of early followers and the research time being later than Market Pioneers, different development strategies are used as opposed to those who entered the market in the beginning, and the same is applied to those who are Late Followers in the market. By having a different strategy, it allows the followers to create their own unique selling point and perhaps target a different audience in comparison to that of the Market Pioneers. Early following into a market can often be encouraged by an established business’ product that is “threatened or has industry-specific supporting assets”.

=====Late entrants=====

Following the so called, &quot;Close Followers&quot; are the &quot;Late Entrants&quot;. They get their name from their delayed arrival into the market. Despite the thought process that late entry into the market will lead to absolute failure, there are actually a few pros for those classified as late entrants. One such pro is the ability to view how others who previously joined the market have acted and strategize market planning around their mistakes and/or successes. Late Followers have the advantage of learning from their early competitors and improving the benefits or reducing the total costs. This allows them to create a strategy that could essentially mean gaining market share and most importantly, staying in the market. In addition to this, markets evolve, leading to consumers wanting improvements and advancements on products. Late Followers have the advantage of catching the shifts in customer needs and wants towards the products. When bearing in mind customer preference, customer value has a significant influence. Customer value means taking into account the investment of customers as well as the brand or product. It is created through the “perceptions of benefits” and the “total cost of ownership”. On the other hand, if the needs and wants of consumers have only slightly altered, Late Followers could have a cost advantage over early entrants due to the use of product imitation. However, if a business is switching markets, this could take the cost advantage away due to the expense of changing markets for the business. Late Entry into a market does not necessarily mean there is a disadvantage when it comes to market share, it depends on how the marketing mix is adopted and the performance of the business. If the marketing mix is not used correctly – despite the entrant time – the business will gain little to no advantages, potentially missing out on a significant opportunity.

The differentiated strategy

The customized target strategy
The requirements of individual customer markets are unique, and their purchases sufficient to make viable the design of a new marketing mix for each customer.

If a company adopts this type of market strategy, a separate marketing mix is to be designed for each customer.

Specific marketing mixes can be developed to appeal to most of the segments when market segmentation reveals several potential targets.

Customization must however be generalized or not target consumers based on race or ethnic background. This sort of marketing strategy is unethical. Currently more research has to be done to discern a way that prevents this strategy, because a generalized set of rules to police what is considered the overall &quot;good&quot; cannot be instituted.

==Developing marketing goals and objectives==

Whereas the vision and mission provide the framework, the &quot;goals define targets within the mission, which, when achieved, should move the organization toward the performance of that mission.&quot; &quot;Goals&quot; are broad primary outcomes whereas, &quot;objectives&quot; are measurable steps taken to achieve a goal or strategy. In strategic planning, it is important for managers to translate the overall strategy into goals and objectives. Goals are designed to inspire action and focus attention on specific desired outcomes. Objectives, on the other hand, are used to measure an organization&#x27;s performance on specific dimensions, thereby providing the organization with feedback on how well it is achieving its goals and strategies.

Managers typically establish objectives using the &quot;balanced scorecard&quot; approach. This means that objectives do not include desired financial outcomes exclusively, but also specify measures of performance for customers (e.g. satisfaction, loyalty, repeat patronage), internal processes (e.g., employee satisfaction, productivity) and innovation and improvement activities.

After setting the goals marketing strategy or marketing plan should be developed. The marketing strategy plan provides an outline of the specific actions to be taken over time to achieve the objectives. Plans can be extended to cover many years, with sub-plans for each year. Plans usually involve monitoring, to assess progress, and prepare for contingencies if problems arise. Simultaneous such as customer lifetime value models can be used to help marketers conduct &quot;what-if&quot; analyses to forecast what potential scenarios arising from possible actions, and to gauge how specific actions might affect such variables as the revenue-per-customer and the churn rate.

==Strategy typologies==
Developing competitive strategy requires significant judgement and is based on a deep understanding of the firm&#x27;s current situation, its past history and its operating environment. No heuristics have yet been developed to assist strategists choose the optimal strategic direction. Nevertheless, some researchers and scholars have sought to classify broad groups of strategy approaches that might serve as broad frameworks for thinking about suitable choices.

===Strategy types===
In 2003, Raymond E. Miles and Charles C. Snow, based on an in-depth cross-industry study of a sample of large corporations, proposed a detailed scheme using four categories:

* Prospectors: proactively seek to locate and exploit new market opportunities
* Analyzers: are very innovative in their product-market choices; tend to follow prospectors into new markets; often introduce new or improved product designs. This type of organisation works in two types of market, one generally stable, one subject to more change
* Defenders: are relatively cautious in their initiatives; seek to seal off a portion of the market which they can defend against competitive incursions; often market highest quality offerings and position as a quality leader
* Reactors: tend to vacillate in their responses to environmental changes and are generally the least profitable organizations

===Marketing strategy===

Marketing warfare strategies are competitor-centered strategies drawn from analogies with the field of military science. Warfare strategies were popular in the 1980s, but interest in this approach has waned in the new era of relationship marketing. An increased awareness of the distinctions between business and military cultures also raises questions about the extent to which this type of analogy is useful. In spite of its limitations, the typology of marketing warfare strategies is useful for predicting and understanding competitor responses.

In the 1980s, Kotler and Singh developed a typology of marketing warfare strategies:

* Frontal attack: where an aggressor goes head to head for the same market segments on an offer by offer, price by price basis; normally used by a market challenger against a more dominant player 
* Flanking attack: attacking an organization on its weakest front; used by market challengers
* Bypass attack: bypassing the market leader by attacking smaller, more vulnerable target organizations in order to broaden the aggressor&#x27;s resource base
* Encirclement attack: attacking a dominant player on all fronts
* Guerilla warfare: sporadic, unexpected attacks using both conventional and unconventional means to attack a rival; normally practiced by smaller players against the market leader

==Relationship between the marketing strategy and the marketing mix==

Marketing strategy and marketing mix are related elements of a comprehensive marketing plan. While marketing strategy is aligned with setting the direction of a company or product/service line, the marketing mix is majorly tactical in nature and is employed to carry out the overall marketing strategy. The 4P&#x27;s of the marketing mix (Price, Product, Place and Promotion) represent the tools that marketers can leverage while defining their marketing strategy to create a marketing plan. Accuracy of marketing mix impacts success of overall marketing strategy. The 4P&#x27;s of this marketing mix, ceteris paribus, should line up with the heart of the company.

<doc id="328242" wikidata="Q713479" url="?curid=328242" title="Jimmy Savile">
<text>Sir James Wilson Vincent Savile (; 31 October 1926 – 29 October 2011) was an English media personality and DJ. He was known for his eccentric image, charitable work, and hosting the BBC shows &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;. After his death, hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse made against him were investigated, tarnishing his reputation and leading the police to conclude that he was a predatory sex offender and possibly one of Britain&#x27;s most prolific. There had been allegations during his lifetime, but they were dismissed and accusers were ignored or disbelieved. Savile&#x27;s victims allegedly included young children and elderly individuals.

As a teenager during the Second World War, Savile worked in coal mines as a Bevin Boy. He began a career playing records in, and later managing, dance halls. His media career started as a disc jockey at Radio Luxembourg in 1958 and at Tyne Tees Television in 1960. From 1964 to 1988, Savile was a regular presenter on the BBC music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, also co-presenting the last edition in 2006. In 1968, he began hosting his own radio shows for Radio 1, broadcasting until 1987. From 1975 to 1994, he presented &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;, an early Saturday evening television programme which arranged for the wishes of viewers, mainly children, to come true.

Savile was known for fundraising and supporting various charities and hospitals, in particular Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Leeds General Infirmary, and Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire. In 2009, he was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prodigious philanthropist&quot; and was honoured for his charity work. He was awarded the OBE in 1971 and was knighted in 1990. Following his death in 2011 at the age of 84, Savile was praised in obituaries for his personal qualities and his work raising an estimated £40 million for charities.

In October 2012, an ITV documentary examined claims of sexual abuse by Savile. This led to extensive media coverage and a substantial and rapidly growing body of witness statements and sexual abuse claims, including accusations against public bodies for covering up or failure of duty. Scotland Yard launched a criminal investigation into allegations of child sex abuse by Savile spanning six decades, describing him as a &quot;predatory sex offender,&quot; and later stated that they were pursuing more than 400 lines of inquiry based on the testimony of 300 potential victims via 14 police forces. The scandal had resulted in inquiries or reviews at the BBC, within the NHS, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the Department of Health. In June 2014, investigations into Savile&#x27;s activities at 28 NHS hospitals concluded that he had sexually assaulted staff and patients aged between 5 and 75 over several decades. As a result of the scandal, some of the honours that Savile was awarded during his career were posthumously revoked and his television appearances are no longer shown.

==Early life==
Savile, born in Consort Terrace, in the Burley area of Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, was the youngest of seven children (his elder siblings were Mary, Marjory, Vincent, John, Joan, and Christina) in a Roman Catholic family. His parents were Vincent Joseph Savile (1886–1953), a bookmaker&#x27;s clerk and insurance agent, and his wife, Agnes Monica Kelly (1886–1972). His paternal grandmother was Scottish, whilst his mother was of Irish descent. Savile grew up during the Great Depression, and later claimed that he &quot;was forged in the crucible of want.&quot; He described his father as &quot;scrupulously honest but scrupulously broke.&quot;

Savile&#x27;s mother believed he owed his life to the intercession of Margaret Sinclair, a Scottish nun, after he recovered quickly from illness, possibly pneumonia, at the age of two when his mother prayed at Leeds Cathedral after picking up a pamphlet about Sinclair. Savile went to St Anne&#x27;s Roman Catholic School in Leeds. After leaving school at the age of 14 he worked in an office. At the age of 18 during the Second World War he was conscripted to work as a Bevin Boy and worked in coal mines, where he reportedly suffered spinal injuries from a shot-firer&#x27;s explosion and he spent a long period recuperating, wearing a steel corset and for three years walking with the aid of sticks. Following his colliery work, Savile became a scrap metal dealer. Savile started playing records in dance halls in the early 1940s, and claimed to be the first DJ. According to his autobiography, he was the first to use two turntables and a microphone at the Grand Records Ball at the Guardbridge Hotel in 1947, although his claim to have been the first is untrue; twin turntables were illustrated in the &quot;BBC Handbook&quot; in 1929 and advertised for sale in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine in 1931. He became a semi-professional sportsman, competing in the 1951 Tour of Britain cycle race and working as a professional wrestler.

Savile lived in Salford from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the later period with Ray Teret, who became his support DJ, assistant, and chauffeur. Savile managed the Plaza Ballroom on Oxford Street, in Manchester city centre, in the mid-1950s. When he lived in Great Clowes Street in Higher Broughton, Salford, he was often seen sitting on his front door steps. He managed the Mecca Locarno ballroom in Leeds in the late 1950s and early 1960s as well as the Mecca-owned Palais dance hall in Ilford, Essex, between 1955 and 1956. His Monday evening records-only dance sessions (admission one shilling) were popular with local teens. It was while at Ilford that Savile was discovered by a music executive from Decca Records.

==Career==
===Radio===
Savile&#x27;s radio career began as a DJ at Radio Luxembourg from 1958 to 1968. By 1968 he presented six programmes a week, and his Saturday show reached six million listeners. In terms of recognition, he was one of the leading DJs in Britain by the early 1960s. In 1968, he joined Radio 1, where he presented &quot;Savile&#x27;s Travels&quot;, a weekly programme broadcast on Sundays in which he travelled around the UK talking to members of the public. From 1969 to 1973 he fronted &quot;Speakeasy&quot;, a discussion programme for teenagers. On Radio 1 he presented the Sunday lunchtime show &quot;Jimmy Savile&#x27;s Old Record Club&quot;, playing chart Top 10s from years gone by. It was the first show to feature old charts and Savile used a &quot;points system&quot; in an imaginary quiz with the audience to guess the names of the song and artist. It began in 1973 as &quot;The Double Top Ten Show&quot;, and ended in 1987 as &quot;The Triple Top Ten Show&quot; when he left Radio 1 after 19 years. He presented &quot;The Vintage Chart Show&quot;, playing top tens from 1957 to 1987, on the BBC World Service from March 1987 until October 1989.

From March 1989 to August 1997, he broadcast on various stations around the UK (mostly taking the Gold format, such as the West Midlands&#x27; Xtra AM and the Classic Gold network in Yorkshire) where he revived his Radio 1 shows. In 1994, satirist Chris Morris gave a fake obituary on BBC Radio 1 saying that Savile had collapsed and died, which allegedly drew threats of legal action from Savile and forced an apology from Morris. On 25 December 2005 and 1 January 2007, he presented shows on the Real Radio network. The Christmas 2005 show counted down the festive Top 10s of 10, 20, and 30 years previously, while the New Year 2007 show (also taken by Century Radio following its acquisition by GMG) featured Savile recounting anecdotes from his past and playing associated records, mostly from the 1960s and some from the 1970s.

===Television===
Savile&#x27;s first television role was as a presenter of Tyne Tees Television&#x27;s music programme &quot;Young at Heart&quot;, which aired from May 1960. Although the show was broadcast in black and white, Savile dyed his hair a different colour every week. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1964, he presented the first edition of the BBC music chart television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; from Dickenson Road Studios, a television studio in a converted church in Rusholme, Manchester. On 30 July 2006, he co-hosted the final weekly edition, ending it with the words &quot;It&#x27;s number one, it&#x27;s still &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;&quot;, before turning off the studio lights after the closing credits. When interviewed by the BBC on 20 November 2008 and asked about the revival of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for a Christmas comeback, he said he would welcome a &quot;cameo role&quot; in the programme.

In the early 1960s, Savile co-hosted (with Pete Murray) the televised &quot;New Musical Express&quot; Poll Winners&#x27; Concert, held annually at the Empire Pool in Wembley, with acts such as the Beatles, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Joe Brown and the Bruvvers, the Who, and many others. On 31 December 1969, he hosted the BBC/ZDF co-production &quot;Pop Go the Sixties&quot;, shown across Western Europe, celebrating the hits of the decade.

Savile presented a series of public information films promoting road safety, notably &quot;Clunk Click Every Trip&quot;, which promoted the use of seatbelts, the clunk representing the sound of the door and the click the sound of the seatbelt fastening. It led to Savile&#x27;s Saturday-night chat/variety show from 1973 on BBC One titled &quot;Clunk, Click&quot;, which in 1974 featured the UK heats of the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot; featuring Olivia Newton-John. After two series, &quot;Clunk, Click&quot; was replaced by &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;, which he presented from 1975 to 1994. Savile won an award from Mary Whitehouse&#x27;s National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association in 1977 for his &quot;wholesome family entertainment&quot;. He fronted a long-running series of advertisements in the early 1980s for British Rail&#x27;s InterCity 125, in which he declared &quot;This is the age of the train.&quot; Savile was twice the subject of the Thames Television series &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in January 1970 with Eamonn Andrews and again in December 1990 with Michael Aspel.

In an interview by Anthony Clare for the radio series &quot;In the Psychiatrist&#x27;s Chair&quot; in 1991, Savile appeared to be &quot;a man without feelings.&quot; &quot;There is something chilling about this 20th-century &#x27;saint&#x27;&quot;, Clare concluded in 1992 in his introduction to the published transcript of this interview. Andrew Neil interviewed him for the TV series &quot;Is This Your Life?&quot; in 1995 where Savile &quot;used a banana to avoid discussing his personal life&quot;. In 1999, he appeared as a panellist on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

In April 2000, he was the subject of a documentary by Louis Theroux, in the &quot;When Louis Met...&quot; series, in which Theroux accompanied British celebrities going about their daily business and interviewed them about their lives and experiences. In the documentary, Savile confided that he used to beat people up and lock them in a basement during his career as a nightclub manager. When Theroux challenged Savile about rumours of paedophilia over a decade before, Savile said: &quot;We live in a very funny world. And it&#x27;s easier for me, as a single man, to say &#x27;I don&#x27;t like children&#x27;, because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt.&quot;

Savile visited the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house on 14 and 15 January 2006 (in series 4) and &quot;fixed it&quot; for some housemates to have their wishes granted; Pete Burns received a message from his boyfriend, Michael, and Lynn, his ex-wife, while Dennis Rodman traded Savile&#x27;s offering for a supply of cigarettes for the other housemates. In 2007, Savile returned to television with &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It Strikes Again&quot; showing some of the most popular fix-its, recreating them with the same people, and making new dreams come true.

==Charity work==
Savile is estimated to have raised £40 million for charity. One cause for which he raised money was Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where he volunteered for many years as a porter. He raised money for the Spinal Unit, NSIC (National Spinal Injuries Centre), and St Francis Ward – a ward for children and teens with spinal cord injuries, as well as Ireland&#x27;s Central Remedial Clinic. Savile also volunteered at Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital. In August 1988, he was appointed by junior health minister Edwina Currie chair of an interim task force overseeing the management of Broadmoor Hospital, after its board members had been suspended. Savile had his own rooms at Stoke Mandeville and Broadmoor. In 1989, Savile started legal proceedings against News Group Newspapers after the &quot;News of the World&quot; published an article in January 1988 suggesting he had been in a position to secure the release of patients from Broadmoor who were considered &quot;dangerous&quot;. Savile won on 11 July 1989; News Group paid his legal costs, and he received an apology from editors Kelvin MacKenzie and Patsy Chapman. In 2012, it was reported that Savile had sexually abused vulnerable patients at the hospitals.

From 1974 to 1988, Savile was the honorary president of Phab (Physically Handicapped in the Able Bodied community). He sponsored medical students performing undergraduate research in the Leeds University Research Enterprise scholarship scheme, donating more than £60,000 every year. In 2010, the scheme was given a commitment of £500,000 over the following five years. Following Savile&#x27;s death in October 2011, it was confirmed that a bequest had been made to allow continued support for the programme.

Savile was a participant in marathons (many for Phab, including its annual half marathon around Hyde Park, London). He also cycled from Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats in 10 days for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and ran in the Scottish People&#x27;s Marathon. It was reported that he completed the London Marathon at the age of 79; rumours that he was driven round in a lead vehicle as an &quot;observer&quot; were denied by marathon officials.

Savile set up two charities, the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust in 1981, and the Leeds-based Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust in 1984. During the sexual abuse scandal in October 2012 the charities announced that they would distribute their funds, of £1.7 million and £3.7 million respectively, among other charities and then close down. He also raised money for several Jewish charities.

==Public image==
During his lifetime and at the time of his death, Savile was regarded as &quot;an eccentric adornment to British public life ... a ubiquitous and distinctive face on television&quot;, who &quot;relished being in the public eye&quot; and was &quot;a shrewd promoter of his own image.&quot; He created a &quot;bizarre yodel&quot;, and catchphrases which included &quot;How&#x27;s about that, then?&quot;, &quot;Now then, now then&quot;, &quot;Goodness gracious&quot;, &quot;As it &#x27;appens&quot;, and &quot;Guys and gals&quot;. Savile was frequently spoofed for his dress sense, which usually featured a tracksuit or shellsuit and gold jewellery. A range of licensed fancy dress costumes was released with his consent in 2009. Savile was often pictured holding a cigar. He claimed to have started smoking cigars at the age of seven, saying &quot;My dad gave me a drag on one at Christmas, thinking it would put me off them forever, but it had the opposite effect.&quot;

Savile was a member of Mensa and the Institute of Advanced Motorists and drove a Rolls-Royce. He was made a life member of the British Gypsy Council in 1975, becoming the first &quot;outsider&quot; to be made a member. In 1984, Savile was accepted as a member of the Athenaeum, a gentlemen&#x27;s club in London&#x27;s Pall Mall, after being proposed by Cardinal Basil Hume. He was chieftain of the Lochaber Highland Games for many years, and owned a house in Glen Coe; his appearance on the final edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 2006 was pre-recorded, because it clashed with the games.

Through his support of charities, Savile became a friend of Margaret Thatcher, who in 1981 described his work as &quot;marvellous&quot;. It has been reported that Savile spent 11 consecutive New Year&#x27;s Eves at Chequers with Thatcher and her family, although this is disputed by Thatcher&#x27;s daughter, Carol, and by Lord Bell, a close friend of the Thatcher family, who said &quot;people make up such rubbish.&quot; Letters released in December 2012 by the National Archives under the thirty-year rule confirm the &quot;close friendship&quot; between Savile and Thatcher. Some of the correspondence was heavily redacted before publication, using exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act.

Savile met Prince Charles through mutual charity interests. His work with Stoke Mandeville Hospital also made Savile a suitable figure to whom the Prince could turn &quot;for advice on navigating Britain&#x27;s health authorities&quot;. Charles met Savile on several occasions. In 1999, Charles visited Savile&#x27;s Glen Coe home for a private meal and reportedly sent him gifts on his 80th birthday and a note reading: &quot;Nobody will ever know what you have done for this country, Jimmy. This is to go some way in thanking you for that.&quot; Savile was also in contact with other members of the royal household and received telegrams from Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as well as a handwritten letter from Princess Alexandra&#x27;s husband Sir Angus Ogilvy and a homemade card from Sarah, Duchess of York. Savile acted as an unofficial adviser to Prince Charles, who sought his advice on a number of occasions on how the royal family ought to interact with the public and media. In 1989, Savile hand-wrote an unofficial set of guidelines to Charles on how members of the royal family and staff may respond to disasters. Charles showed the dossier to his father, Prince Philip, who passed the contents on to Queen Elizabeth II.

A lifelong bachelor, Savile lived with his mother (whom he referred to as the &quot;Duchess&quot;) and kept her bedroom and wardrobe exactly as it was when she died. Every year he had her clothes dry cleaned. In his autobiography, he claimed he had had many sexual relations with women, and that &quot;there have been trains and, with apologies to the hit parade, boats and planes (I am a member of the 40,000 ft club) and bushes and fields, corridors, doorways, floors, chairs, slag heaps, desks, and probably everything except the celebrated chandelier and ironing board.&quot;

==Health and death==

On 9 August 1997, Savile underwent a three-hour quadruple heart-bypass operation at Killingbeck Hospital in Killingbeck, Leeds, having known he needed the surgery for at least four years after attending regular check-ups. He arranged for a bench in Scarborough, North Yorkshire to be dedicated to his memory, with a plaque saying &quot;Jimmy Savile – but not just yet!&quot;

On 29 October 2011, Savile was found dead at his penthouse flat overlooking Roundhay Park in Leeds, two days before his 85th birthday. He had been in hospital with pneumonia, and his death was not suspicious. His nephew, Roger Foster, said he &quot;passed away quietly in his sleep during the night&quot;. 

His closed satin gold coffin was displayed at the Queens Hotel in Leeds, with the last cigar he smoked and his two &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; books. Around 4,000 people visited to pay tribute. His funeral took place at the Roman Catholic Leeds Cathedral on 9 November 2011, and he was buried at Woodlands Cemetery in Scarborough. As specified in his will, his coffin was inclined at 45 degrees to fulfil his wish to &quot;see the sea&quot;. The coffin was encased in concrete &quot;as a security measure&quot;.

An auction of Savile&#x27;s possessions was conducted at the Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds, on 30 July 2012, with the proceeds going to charity. His silver Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible was sold for £130,000 to an Internet bidder. The vehicle&#x27;s number plate, JS 247, featured the original medium wave wavelength used by BBC Radio 1 (247 metres).

==Sexual abuse by Savile==
Savile often came into contact with his victims through his creative projects for the BBC and his charitable work for the NHS. A significant part of his career and public life involved working with children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years from 1964 presenting &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, aimed at a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true.

===Allegations during his lifetime===
During his lifetime, two police investigations considered reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought related to sexual offences. Sporadic allegations of child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but these only became widely publicised after his death. His autobiography &quot;As it Happens&quot; (1974; reprinted as &quot;Love is an Uphill Thing&quot;, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.

Former Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd vocalist John Lydon alluded to sordid conduct committed by Savile, as well as suppression of widely held knowledge about such activity, in an October 1978 interview recorded for BBC Radio 1. Lydon stated: &quot;I&#x27;d like to kill Jimmy Savile; I think he&#x27;s a hypocrite. I bet he&#x27;s into all kinds of seediness that we all know about, but are not allowed to talk about. I know some rumours.&quot; He added: &quot;I bet none of this will be allowed out.&quot; As predicted, the comment was edited out by the BBC prior to broadcasting, but the complete interview was included as a bonus track on a re-release of Public Image Ltd&#x27;s 1978 debut album &quot;Public Image: First Issue&quot; in 2013, after Savile&#x27;s death. In October 2014, Lydon expanded on his original quote, saying: &quot;By killed I meant locking him up and stopping him assaulting young children... I&#x27;m disgusted at the media pretending they weren&#x27;t aware.&quot; In 1987, Scottish stand-up comedian Jerry Sadowitz recorded a performance in Edinburgh in which he stated that Savile was a paedophile. The album, &quot;Gobshite&quot;, was withdrawn amid fears of legal action.

In a 1990 interview for &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, Lynn Barber asked Savile about rumours that he liked &quot;little girls.&quot; Savile&#x27;s reply was that, as he worked in the pop music business, &quot;the young girls in question don&#x27;t gather round me because of me – it&#x27;s because I know the people they love, the stars... I am of no interest to them.&quot; In April 2000, in a documentary by Louis Theroux, &quot;When Louis Met... Jimmy&quot;, Savile acknowledged &quot;salacious tabloid people&quot; had raised rumours about whether he was a paedophile, and said, &quot;I know I&#x27;m not.&quot; A follow-up documentary, &quot;Louis Theroux: Savile&quot;, about Savile and Theroux&#x27;s inability to dig more deeply, aired on BBC Two in 2016.

In 2007, Savile was interviewed under caution by police investigating an allegation of indecent assault in the 1970s at the now-closed Duncroft Approved School for Girls near Staines, Surrey, where he was a regular visitor. In October 2009, the Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action and no charges were brought. In March 2008, Savile started legal proceedings against &quot;The Sun&quot;, which had linked him in several articles to child abuse at the Jersey children&#x27;s home Haut de la Garenne. At first, he denied visiting Haut de la Garenne, but later admitted he had done so following the publication of a photograph showing him at the home surrounded by children. The States of Jersey Police said that in 2008 an allegation of an indecent assault by Savile at the home in the 1970s had been investigated, but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed.

In a 2009 interview with his biographer, Savile defended viewers of child pornography, including pop star and convicted sex offender Gary Glitter. He argued that viewers &quot;didn&#x27;t do anything wrong but they are then demonised&quot;, and described Glitter as a celebrity being unfairly vilified for watching &quot;dodgy films&quot; in the privacy of his home: &quot;Gary... has not tried to sell &#x27;em, not tried to show them in public or anything like that. It were for his own gratification. Whether it was right or wrong is, of course, it&#x27;s up to him as a person.&quot; The interview was not published at the time, and the recording was not released until after Savile&#x27;s death.

In 2012, Sir Roger Jones, a former BBC governor for Wales and chairman of BBC charity &quot;Children in Need&quot;, disclosed that more than a decade before Savile&#x27;s death he had banned the &quot;very strange&quot; and &quot;creepy&quot; Savile from involvement in the charity. Former royal family press secretary Dickie Arbiter said Savile&#x27;s behaviour had raised &quot;concern and suspicion&quot; when Savile acted as an informal marriage counsellor between Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the late 1980s, although no reports had been made. Arbiter added that during his regular visits to Charles&#x27;s office at St James&#x27;s Palace, Savile would &quot;do the rounds of the young ladies taking their hands and rubbing his lips all the way up their arms.&quot;

===After his death===
Immediately after Savile&#x27;s death, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme began an investigation into reports that he was a sexual abuser. Meirion Jones and Liz MacKean interviewed one alleged victim on camera and others agreed to have their stories told. The interviewees alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, Stoke Mandeville Hospital and the BBC. &quot;Newsnight&quot; also discovered that Surrey Police had investigated allegations of abuse against Savile. The item was scheduled for broadcast in &quot;Newsnight&quot; on 7 December 2011, but was withdrawn before broadcast; over Christmas 2011, the BBC broadcast two tributes to Savile.

In December 2012, a review led by Nick Pollard of the BBC&#x27;s handling of the issue described the decision not to broadcast the &quot;Newsnight&quot; investigation as &quot;flawed.&quot; The review said that Jones and MacKean had found &quot;cogent evidence&quot; that Savile was an abuser. George Entwistle – at that time the Director of BBC Vision – who had been told about the plan to broadcast the &quot;Newsnight&quot; item, was described by the review as &quot;unnecessarily cautious, and an opportunity was lost.&quot; There was no public mention of the &quot;Newsnight&quot; investigation into Savile in December 2011 but in early 2012 several newspapers reported that the BBC had investigated but not broadcast (its report of) allegations of sexual abuse immediately after his death. &quot;The Oldie&quot; alleged there had been a cover-up by the BBC.

On 28 September 2012, almost a year after his death, ITV said it would broadcast a documentary as part of its &quot;Exposure&quot; series&quot;, The Other Side of Jimmy Savile&quot;. The documentary, presented by Mark Williams-Thomas, a consultant on the original &quot;Newsnight&quot; investigation, revealed claims by up to 10 women, including one aged under 14 at the time, that they had been molested or raped by Savile during the 1960s and 1970s. The announcement attracted national attention, and more reports and claims of abuse against him accumulated. The documentary was broadcast on 3 October. The next day, the Metropolitan Police said the Child Abuse Investigation Command would assess the allegations.

The developing scandal led to inquiries into practices at the BBC and the National Health Service. It was alleged that rumours of Savile&#x27;s activities had circulated at the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s, but no action had been taken. The Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, apologised for what had happened, and on 16 October 2012 appointed former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith to review the culture and practices of the BBC during the time Savile worked there; and Nick Pollard, a former Sky News executive, was appointed to look at why the &quot;Newsnight&quot; investigation into Savile&#x27;s activities was dropped shortly before transmission in December 2011.

By 19 October 2012, police were pursuing 400 lines of inquiry based on testimony from 200 witnesses via 14 police forces across the UK. They described the alleged abuse as &quot;on an unprecedented scale&quot;, and the number of potential victims as &quot;staggering.&quot; Investigations codenamed Operation Yewtree were opened to identify criminal conduct related to Savile&#x27;s activities by the Metropolitan Police, and to review the 2009 decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to drop a prosecution as &quot;unlikely to succeed.&quot; By 25 October, police reported the number of possible victims was approaching 300.

On 22 October 2012, the BBC programme &quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast an investigation into &quot;Newsnight&quot; and found evidence suggesting &quot;senior manager&quot; pressure; on the same day &quot;Newsnight&quot; editor Peter Rippon &quot;stepped down&quot; with immediate effect. The Department of Health appointed former barrister Kate Lampard to chair and oversee its investigations into Savile&#x27;s activities at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Leeds General Infirmary, Broadmoor Hospital, and other hospitals and facilities in England.

On 12 November 2012, the Metropolitan Police announced the scale of sexual allegations reported against Savile was &quot;unprecedented&quot; in Britain: a total of 450 alleged victims had contacted the police in the ten weeks since the investigation was launched. Officers recorded 199 crimes in 17 police force areas in which Savile was a suspect, among them 31 allegations of rape in seven force areas. Analysis of the report showed 82% of those who came forward to report abuse were female and 80% were children or young people at the time of the incidents. According to one former Broadmoor nurse, Savile said he engaged in necrophiliac acts with corpses in the Leeds General Infirmary mortuary. Savile was said to be friends with the chief mortician, who gave him near-unrestricted access.

&quot;Exposure Update: The Jimmy Savile Investigation&quot; was shown on ITV on 21 November 2012. In March 2013, Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary reported that 214 of the complaints that had been made against Savile after his death would have been criminal offences if they had been reported at the time. Sixteen victims reported being raped by Savile when they were under 16 (the age of heterosexual consent in England) and four of those had been under the age of 10. Thirteen others reported serious sexual assaults by Savile, including four who had been under 10 years old. Another 10 victims reported being raped by Savile after the age of 16.

In January 2013, a joint report by the NSPCC and Metropolitan Police, &quot;Giving Victims a Voice&quot;, stated that 450 people had made complaints against Savile, the period of alleged abuse stretching from 1955 to 2009 and the ages of the complainants at the times of the assaults ranging from 8 to 47. The suspected victims included 28 children aged under 10, including 10 boys aged eight. A further 63 were girls aged between 13 and 16, and nearly three-quarters of his alleged victims were under 18. Some 214 criminal offences were recorded, 34 rapes having been reported across 28 police forces.

Former professional wrestler Adrian Street described in a November 2013 interview how &quot;Savile used to go on and on about the young girls who&#x27;d wait in line for him outside his dressing room ... He&#x27;d pick the ones he wanted and say to the rest, &#x27;Unlucky, come back again tomorrow night&#x27;.&quot; Savile, who cultivated a &quot;tough guy&quot; image promoted by his entourage, was hit with real blows during a 1971 bout with Street, who commented that had he &quot;known then the full extent of what I know about [Savile] now, I&#x27;d have given him an even bigger hiding – were that physically possible.&quot;

During the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in March 2019, it was reported that Robert Armstrong, the head of the Honours Committee, had resisted attempts by Margaret Thatcher to award Savile a knighthood in the 1980s, due to concerns about his private life. An anonymous letter received by the committee in 1998 said that &quot;reports of a paedophilia nature&quot; could emerge about Savile. In 2022, former BBC presenter Mark Lawson wrote about his encounters with Savile, and hearing from many BBC personnel – not at the top level – about his abuse and rumoured necrophilia. Lawson ended:
===Aftermath===
An authorised biography, &quot;How&#x27;s About That Then?&quot;, by Alison Bellamy, was published in June 2012. After the claims made against him were published, the author said that, in the light of the allegations, she felt &quot;let down and betrayed&quot; by Savile. Within a month of the child abuse scandal emerging, many places and organisations named after or connected to Savile were renamed or had his name removed. A memorial plaque on the wall of Savile&#x27;s former home in Scarborough was removed in early October 2012 after it was defaced with graffiti. A wooden statue of Savile at Scotstoun Leisure Centre in Glasgow was also removed around the same time. Signs on a footpath in Scarborough named &quot;Savile&#x27;s View&quot; were removed. Savile&#x27;s Hall, the conference centre at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds, was renamed New Dock Hall. The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust and the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust, two registered charities founded in his name to fight &quot;poverty and sickness and other charitable purposes&quot; announced they were too closely tied to his name to be sustainable and would close and distribute their funds to other charities, so as to avoid harm to beneficiaries from future media attention.

On 9 October 2012, relatives said the headstone of Savile&#x27;s grave would be removed, destroyed, and sent to landfill. The Savile family expressed their sorrow for the &quot;anguish&quot; of the victims and &quot;respect [for] public opinion.&quot; Savile&#x27;s body is interred in the cemetery in Scarborough, although it has been proposed that it be exhumed and cremated. On 28 October, it was reported that Savile&#x27;s cottage in Glen Coe had been vandalised with spray-paint and the door damaged. The cottage was sold in May 2013.

In 2012, Richard Harrison, a long-serving psychiatric nurse at Broadmoor Hospital, said that Savile had long been regarded by staff as &quot;a man with a severe personality disorder and a liking for children.&quot; Another nurse, Bob Allen, considered Savile to be a psychopath, stating: &quot;A lot of the staff said he should be behind bars.&quot; Allen also said that he had once reported Savile to his supervisor for apparent improper conduct with a juvenile, but no action was taken. Psychologists in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Herald&quot; argued that Savile exhibited the dark triad of personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.

Savile&#x27;s estate, believed to be worth about £4–4.3 million, was frozen by its executors, NatWest bank, in view of the possibility that those alleging that they had been assaulted by Savile could make claims for damages. After &quot;a range of expenses&quot; were charged to the estate, a remainder of about £3.3 million was available to compensate victims, those victims not having a claim against another entity (such as the BBC or the National Health Service) being given priority, and all victims limited to a maximum claim of £60,000 against all entities combined. The compensation scheme was approved in late 2014 by the courts. Most of Savile&#x27;s honours were rescinded following the sexual abuse claims. As a knighthood expires when the holder dies, it cannot be posthumously revoked. The Cabinet Office stated in September 2021, with reference to his OBE and knighthood, that &quot;The Forfeiture Committee can confirm that had James Wilson Vincent Savile been convicted of the crimes of which he is accused, forfeiture proceedings would have commenced.&quot; Episodes of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; hosted by him are not repeated.

On 26 June 2014, UK Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt delivered a public apology in the House of Commons to the patients of the National Health Service abused by Savile. He confirmed that complaints had been raised before 2012 but were ignored by the bureaucratic system:

In April 2022, Netflix released a two-part documentary, &quot;Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story&quot;, commissioned from 72 Films. It covered the life and career of Savile, his history of committing sexual abuse, and the scandal that occurred after his death in 2011, when numerous complaints were raised about his behaviour.

===Dramatisation===
In October 2020 the BBC announced a television mini-series with the working title &quot;The Reckoning&quot;, intended to recount Savile&#x27;s rise to fame and the sexual abuse scandal that emerged after his death. The drama was originally planned to appear in the BBC&#x27;s autumn 2022 schedule, but after a delay for re-editing, it was broadcast in October 2023. A source said, &quot;The four-part drama is being edited in such a meticulous and careful way, so as not to create more pain and suffering for Savile&#x27;s victims.&quot; It was based in part on the book &quot;In Plain Sight: the Life and Lies of Jimmy Savile&quot; by Dan Davies.

Writer Neil McKay and producer Jeff Pope had previously worked together on dramatisations on the murders of Fred West, the disappearance of Shannon Matthews, and the murders of Stephen Port. In September 2021 Steve Coogan was cast as Savile; he said he did not take the decision lightly, and that it was a &quot;horrific story which – however harrowing – needs to be told.&quot;

==Honours and awards==
* In the 1972 New Year Honours, Savile was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, entitled to append OBE to his name.
* In the 1990 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Savile was made a Knight Bachelor &quot;for charitable services&quot;, entitled to use the honorific prefix Sir. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had made four attempts to have him knighted before succeeding in her final year in office. Following the allegations of sexual abuse, British Prime Minister David Cameron suggested in October 2012 that it would be possible for Savile&#x27;s honours to be rescinded by the Honours Forfeiture Committee. A Cabinet Office spokesman said that there was no procedure to posthumously revoke an OBE or knighthood, as these honours automatically expire when a person dies, but that the committee might consider introducing a process to do so in the light of Savile&#x27;s case. On 30 September 2021, the Forfeiture Committee published a statement in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; stating that &quot;the Director for Public Prosecutions has stated that criminal prosecutions should have occurred during his lifetime, based on the evidence&quot; and confirmed that &quot;had James Wilson Vincent Savile been convicted of the crimes of which he is accused, forfeiture proceedings would have commenced.&quot;
* Savile was honoured with a Papal knighthood by being made a Knight Commander of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great (KCSG) by Pope John Paul II in 1990. After the scandal broke, the Catholic Church in England and Wales asked the Holy See to consider stripping Savile of the honour. In October 2012, Father Federico Lombardi told BBC News &quot;The Holy See firmly condemns the horrible crimes of sexual abuse of minors, [and the honour] in the light of recent information should certainly not have been bestowed ... As there does not exist any permanent official list of persons who have received papal honours in the past, it is not possible to strike anyone off a list that does not exist. The names of recipients of papal honours do not appear in the Pontifical Year Book and the honour expires with the death of the individual&quot;. 
* Savile was an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR).
* Savile had the Cross of Merit of the &#x27;.

===Withdrawn honours===
Many honours are considered to cease on the death of the holder; some of Savile&#x27;s honours were considered no longer applicable, and did not need to be rescinded. In other cases honours were withdrawn, or removed from lists:

* In the 1970s, Savile was awarded an honorary green beret by the Royal Marines for completing the Royal Marine Commando speed march, across Dartmoor carrying of kit. Following the allegations of child abuse, his beret award was not revoked, as that honour expires upon death of the marine. However, the Royal Marines ordered that any certification granted to Savile or mention of Savile&#x27;s name in their records be expunged immediately.
* Savile was awarded an honorary doctorate of law (LLD) by the University of Leeds in 1986, which was revoked in 2012.
* Savile was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bedfordshire in 2009, which was posthumously rescinded in October 2012.
* Savile was made a Freeman of the Borough of Scarborough in 2005. This honour was removed in November 2012.

As one might expect, &quot;beer-tella&quot; smells strongly of beer, and is made at the Sapporo Beer Factory.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tagajō has recently plateaued after a long period of growth.
==History==
The area of present-day Tagajō was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period by the Emishi people. Per the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, following a huge earthquake in the year 715 AD, a large number of people migrated to this area from the southern Kantō region, forming numerous fortified settlements in the hinterland. In 729 AD, a large fortified settlement, Taga Castle, was established by the imperial dynasty as a military center to establish control over the region and to protect these colonists. The fortification became the administrative capital of Mutsu Province under the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system. The tsunami in 869 caused extensive flooding of the Sendai plain, destroying the town of Tagajō. Archaeological investigations have identified the remains of 8th and 9th century buildings beneath the present town, covered by sediments dated to the middle of the 10th century.

During the later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate.

After the start of the Meiji period, the modern village of Tagajō was established with the creation of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. From 1945 to 1954, a United States Army base, Camp Loper, was located in the town. Tagajō was elevated to town status on July 1, 1951. In the mid-1960s, the town was designated as an industrial development zone due to its proximity to Sendai harbor. Tagajō was designated a city on November 1, 1971.
The city was seriously affected by the tsunami caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. As of April 7, 2011, 177 people were known dead, with 15 missing. 1,811 people were living in shelters.

==Government==
Tagajō has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members.

<text>Terry John Bozzio (born December 27, 1950) is an American drummer best known for his work with Missing Persons, U.K., and Frank Zappa. He has been featured on nine solo or collaborative albums, 26 albums with Zappa and seven albums with Missing Persons. Bozzio has been a prolific sideman, playing on numerous releases by other artists since the mid-1970s. He was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1997.

== Biography ==

Terry Bozzio was born on December 27, 1950, in San Francisco, California. He started at age 6 playing makeshift drum sets. At the age of 13 he saw the Beatles&#x27; premiere performance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and begged his father for drum lessons. He cited Carmine Appice, Mitch Mitchell and Ginger Baker among his biggest influences in the early years. 

In 1968, Bozzio graduated from Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo, California, where he received a music scholarship award, and later went on to the College of Marin. During this time he studied concurrently with Chuck Brown on the drum set and Lloyd Davis and Roland Kohloff on a percussion and timpani scholarship. He also played Bartok-Dahl-Cowell &amp; Baroque chamber ensembles with the Marin and Napa County Symphonies.

=== 1970s ===

In 1972, Bozzio played in the rock musicals &quot;Godspell&quot; and &quot;Walking in my Time&quot;. He began playing in local jazz groups with Mike Nock, Art Lande, Azteca, Eddie Henderson, Woody Shaw, Julian Priester, Eric Gravatt, Billy Higgins, Andy Narell and Mel Martin. He became a regular in the Monday Night Jim Dukey Big Band at San Francisco&#x27;s Great American Music Hall.

Bozzio recorded and toured with Frank Zappa beginning in 1975, and appeared, also as a vocalist, on a number of Zappa&#x27;s most successful albums, including &quot;Zoot Allures&quot; (1976), &quot;Zappa in New York&quot; (1976), &quot;Sheik Yerbouti&quot; (1979) and &quot;Thing-Fish&quot; (1984), and in the concert movie &quot;Baby Snakes&quot; (1979) (which includes him singing lead on a portion of the song &quot;Punky&#x27;s Whips&quot;). Bozzio became a staple of Zappa&#x27;s live act, not only because of his drumming capability but also by playing the role of the Devil in the song Titties &amp; Beer. The song called for Bozzio to don a devil mask and argued with Zappa&#x27;s protagonist character, hurling insults at each other throughout.

In 1977, he joined The Brecker Brothers with longtime San Francisco friend and guitarist Barry Finnerty. With The Brecker Brothers, Bozzio toured and recorded the live album &quot;Heavy Metal Be-Bop&quot; (1978). Shortly after, he was dismissed by Zappa and joined Group 87 with Mark Isham, Peter Maunu, Patrick O&#x27;Hearn and Peter Wolf. The group auditioned for and was signed to a record deal with CBS but Bozzio declined membership and then auditioned unsuccessfully for Thin Lizzy.

After Bill Bruford and Allan Holdsworth departed from the band U.K. in late 1978, Bozzio joined Eddie Jobson and John Wetton to continue U.K. as a trio. The trio recorded &quot;Danger Money&quot; (1979) and a live album &quot;Night After Night&quot; (1979) and toured the U.S. and Canada twice (supporting the popular progressive rock band Jethro Tull), and in Europe and Japan.

=== 1980s ===

After U.K. disbanded in early 1980, Bozzio, ex-Zappa guitarist Warren Cuccurullo and then-wife and vocalist Dale Bozzio founded the band Missing Persons. Missing Persons released the albums &quot;Spring Session M&quot; (which went Gold), &quot;Rhyme &amp; Reason,&quot; and &quot;Color in Your Life.&quot;

After Missing Persons broke up in 1986, Bozzio joined ex-Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor&#x27;s solo band. He also played on sessions with Robbie Robertson, Gary Wright, Don Dokken, XYZ, Paul Hyde, Herbie Hancock, Dweezil Zappa, and Richard Marx.

During this time, Bozzio began touring as a clinician/solo drummer and recorded &quot;Solo Drums,&quot; which was his first instructional video for Warner Brothers. He joined Mick Jagger and Jeff Beck for the video &quot;Throwaway&quot;, and teamed up with Beck and keyboardist Tony Hymas to co-write/produce and perform on the Grammy Award-winning album &quot;Jeff Beck&#x27;s Guitar Shop&quot;. The album was promoted on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, which was Jeff Beck&#x27;s first-ever live appearance on American television.

He also featured on the album &quot;Confetti&quot; by Sergio Mendes in 1984.

=== 1990s ===
Between 1990 and 1995, Bozzio developed ostinato-based drum solo compositions and recorded his second instructional video Melodic Drumming and the Ostinato Volumes 1, 2, and 3, as well as Solo Drum Music Volumes 1 &amp; 2 on CD. He also joined Tony Hymas, Tony Coe, and Hugh Burns to form the band Lonely Bears and record The Lonely Bears, Injustice, and The Bears are Running, while living in Paris, France. He also formed the band Polytown with David Torn and Mick Karn. In 1993 Terry joined T. M. Stevens and Devin Townsend on Steve Vai&#x27;s &quot;Sex &amp; Religion&quot; album.

From 1995 to 2002, Bozzio did tours of the US, Australia, Canada &amp; Europe as a solo drum artist as well as recording two solo CDs: Drawing the Circle and Chamberworks. He was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1997. With bassist and Chapman Stick player Tony Levin and guitarist Steve Stevens, he formed the group Bozzio Levin Stevens, which released two albums: &quot;Black Light Syndrome&quot; in 1997, and &quot;Situation Dangerous&quot; in 2000.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, he teamed up with Chad Wackerman to produce the Duets video and Alternative Duets CDs. Bozzio won the Clinician of the Year award twice as well as Drum Magazine&#x27;s Drummer of the Year and Best Clinician. Internationally, he received Slagwerkkrant Magazine&#x27;s (Netherlands) and Player Magazine&#x27;s (Japan) Best Drummer Award.

Bozzio was inducted into Guitar Center&#x27;s RockWalk in Hollywood on January 17, 2007. He worked with the nu metal band Korn on their eighth studio album after the departure of their drummer David Silveria. He was scheduled to play on the road with the band during the Family Values Tour, but he left and was replaced by Joey Jordison of Slipknot and later Ray Luzier.

==Personal life==
His son and stepdaughter are also drummers; the latter, Marina, is a former member of the band Aldious.

<text>In geometry, Pick&#x27;s theorem provides a formula for the area of a simple polygon with integer vertex coordinates, in terms of the number of integer points within it and on its boundary. The result was first described by Georg Alexander Pick in 1899. It was popularized in English by Hugo Steinhaus in the 1950 edition of his book &quot;Mathematical Snapshots&quot;. It has multiple proofs, and can be generalized to formulas for certain kinds of non-simple polygons.

==Formula==

Suppose that a polygon has integer coordinates for all of its vertices. Let formula_1 be the number of integer points interior to the polygon, and let formula_2 be the number of integer points on its boundary (including both vertices and points along the sides). Then the area formula_3 of this polygon is:
formula_4
The example shown has formula_5 interior points and formula_6 boundary points, so its area is formula_7 square units.

==Proofs==
===Via Euler&#x27;s formula===
One proof of this theorem involves subdividing the polygon into triangles with three integer vertices and no other integer points. One can then prove that each subdivided triangle has area exactly formula_8. Therefore, the area of the whole polygon equals half the number of triangles in the subdivision. After relating area to the number of triangles in this way, the proof concludes by using Euler&#x27;s polyhedral formula to relate the number of triangles to the number of grid points in the polygon.
The first part of this proof shows that a triangle with three integer vertices and no other integer points has area exactly formula_8, as Pick&#x27;s formula states. The proof uses the fact that all triangles tile the plane, with adjacent triangles rotated by 180° from each other around their shared edge. For tilings by a triangle with three integer vertices and no other integer points, each point of the integer grid is a vertex of six tiles. Because the number of triangles per grid point (six) is twice the number of grid points per triangle (three), the triangles are twice as dense in the plane as the grid points. Any scaled region of the plane contains twice as many triangles (in the limit as the scale factor goes to infinity) as the number of grid points it contains. Therefore, each triangle has area formula_8, as needed for the proof. A different proof that these triangles have area formula_8 is based on the use of Minkowski&#x27;s theorem on lattice points in symmetric convex sets.
This already proves Pick&#x27;s formula for a polygon that is one of these special triangles. Any other polygon can be subdivided into special triangles: add non-crossing line segments within the polygon between pairs of grid points until no more line segments can be added. The only polygons that cannot be subdivided in this way are the special triangles considered above; therefore, only special triangles can appear in the resulting subdivision. Because each special triangle has area formula_8, a polygon of area formula_3 will be subdivided into formula_14 special triangles.

The subdivision of the polygon into triangles forms a planar graph, and Euler&#x27;s formula formula_15 gives an equation that applies to the number of vertices, edges, and faces of any planar graph. The vertices are just the grid points of the polygon; there are formula_16 of them. The faces are the triangles of the subdivision, and the single region of the plane outside of the polygon. The number of triangles is formula_14, so altogether there are formula_18 faces. To count the edges, observe that there are formula_19 sides of triangles in the subdivision. Each edge interior to the polygon is the side of two triangles. However, there are formula_2 edges of triangles that lie along the polygon&#x27;s boundary and form part of only one triangle. Therefore, the number of sides of triangles obeys the equation formula_21, from which one can solve for the number of edges, formula_22. Plugging these values for formula_23, formula_24, and formula_25 into Euler&#x27;s formula formula_15 gives
formula_27
Pick&#x27;s formula is obtained by solving this linear equation for formula_3. An alternative but similar calculation involves proving that the number of edges of the same subdivision is formula_29, leading to the same result.

It is also possible to go the other direction, using Pick&#x27;s theorem (proved in a different way) as the basis for a proof of Euler&#x27;s formula.

===Other proofs===
Alternative proofs of Pick&#x27;s theorem that do not use Euler&#x27;s formula include the following.
*One can recursively decompose the given polygon into triangles, allowing some triangles of the subdivision to have area larger than 1/2. Both the area and the counts of points used in Pick&#x27;s formula add together in the same way as each other, so the truth of Pick&#x27;s formula for general polygons follows from its truth for triangles. Any triangle subdivides its bounding box into the triangle itself and additional right triangles, and the areas of both the bounding box and the right triangles are easy to compute. Combining these area computations gives Pick&#x27;s formula for triangles, and combining triangles gives Pick&#x27;s formula for arbitrary polygons.
*Alternatively, instead of using grid squares centered on the grid points, it is possible to use grid squares having their vertices at the grid points. These grid squares cut the given polygon into pieces, which can be rearranged (by matching up pairs of squares along each edge of the polygon) into a polyomino with the same area.
*Pick&#x27;s theorem may also be proved based on complex integration of a doubly periodic function related to Weierstrass elliptic functions.
*Applying the Poisson summation formula to the characteristic function of the polygon leads to another proof.

Pick&#x27;s theorem was included in a 1999 web listing of the &quot;top 100 mathematical theorems&quot;, which later became used by Freek Wiedijk as a benchmark set to test the power of different proof assistants. , Pick&#x27;s theorem had been formalized and proven in only two of the ten proof assistants recorded by Wiedijk.

==Generalizations==

Generalizations to Pick&#x27;s theorem to non-simple polygons are more complicated and require more information than just the number of interior and boundary vertices. For instance, a polygon with holes bounded by simple integer polygons, disjoint from each other and from the boundary, has area
formula_30
It is also possible to generalize Pick&#x27;s theorem to regions bounded by more complex planar straight-line graphs with integer vertex coordinates, using additional terms defined using the Euler characteristic of the region and its boundary, or to polygons with a single boundary polygon that can cross itself, using a formula involving the winding number of the polygon around each integer point as well as its total winding number.
The Reeve tetrahedra in three dimensions have four integer points as vertices and contain no other integer points, but do not all have the same volume. Therefore, there does not exist an analogue of Pick&#x27;s theorem in three dimensions that expresses the volume of a polyhedron as a function only of its numbers of interior and boundary points. However, these volumes can instead be expressed using Ehrhart polynomials.

==Related topics==
Several other mathematical topics relate the areas of regions to the numbers of grid points. Blichfeldt&#x27;s theorem states that every shape can be translated to contain at least its area in grid points. The Gauss circle problem concerns bounding the error between the areas and numbers of grid points in circles. The problem of counting integer points in convex polyhedra arises in several areas of mathematics and computer science.
In application areas, the dot planimeter is a transparency-based device for estimating the area of a shape by counting the grid points that it contains. The Farey sequence is an ordered sequence of rational numbers with bounded denominators whose analysis involves Pick&#x27;s theorem.

Another simple method for calculating the area of a polygon is the shoelace formula. It gives the area of any simple polygon as a sum of terms computed from the coordinates of consecutive pairs of its vertices. Unlike Pick&#x27;s theorem, the shoelace formula does not require the vertices to have integer coordinates.

<text>Allan Holdsworth (6 August 1946 – 15 April 2017) was a British jazz and rock guitarist, violinist and composer. He contributed to numerous bands, including Soft Machine, U.K., The Tony Williams Lifetime, Pierre Moerlen&#x27;s Gong and Bruford, in addition to solo work.

Holdsworth was known for his esoteric and idiosyncratic usage of advanced music theory concepts, especially with respect to melody and harmony. His music incorporates a vast array of complex chord progressions, often using unusual chord shapes in an abstract way based on his understanding of &quot;chord scales&quot;, and intricate improvised solos, frequently across shifting tonal centres. He used myriad scale forms often derived from those such as the Lydian, diminished, harmonic major, augmented, whole tone, chromatic and altered scales, among others, often resulting in an unpredictable and dissonant &quot;outside&quot; sound. His unique legato soloing technique stemmed from his original desire to play the saxophone. Unable to afford one, he strove to use the guitar to create similarly smooth lines of notes. He also became associated with playing an early form of guitar synthesizer called the SynthAxe, a company he endorsed in the 1980s.

Holdsworth has been cited as an influence by a host of rock, metal and jazz guitarists such as Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Greg Howe, Shawn Lane, Richie Kotzen, John Petrucci, Alex Lifeson, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Yngwie Malmsteen, Michael Romeo, Ty Tabor, Fredrik Thordendal, Daniel Mongrain, John Frusciante, Tom Morello, and Tosin Abasi. Frank Zappa once lauded him as &quot;one of the most interesting guys on guitar on the planet&quot;, while Robben Ford has said: &quot;I think Allan Holdsworth is the John Coltrane of the guitar. I don&#x27;t think anyone can do as much with the guitar as Allan Holdsworth can.&quot;

==Early life==
Holdsworth was born in Bradford, where he was raised by his maternal grandparents, Sam and Elsie Holdsworth. He was raised in a house on Priestman Street, and went to the nearby Drummond Street Middle School. Sam Holdsworth was a jazz pianist who had previously moved to London to pursue a career in music, but had eventually returned to Bradford. Holdsworth was given his first guitar at the age of 17 and received his initial music tuition from his grandfather. His professional career began when he joined the Glen South Band, which performed on the Mecca club circuit across Northern England.

==Recording career==
===Early career and 1970s===

Holdsworth first recorded in 1969 with the band &#x27;Igginbottom on their lone release, &quot;&#x27;Igginbottom&#x27;s Wrench&quot; (later reissued under the group name of &quot;Allan Holdsworth &amp; Friends&quot;). In 1971 he joined Sunship, an improvisational band featuring keyboardist Alan Gowen, future King Crimson percussionist Jamie Muir and bassist Laurie Baker. They played live but never released any recorded material. Next came a brief stint with jazz rock band Nucleus, with whom Holdsworth played on their 1972 album, &quot;Belladonna&quot;; likewise with progressive rock band Tempest, on their self-titled first studio album in 1973. His playing can also be heard on a live BBC Radio concert from that year, which was released several decades later in 2005 as part of &quot;Under the Blossom: The Anthology&quot;, a Tempest compilation album most notable for the song &quot;Gorgon&quot;. There has been an urban myth, propagated in part by the singer Donovan, that Holdsworth played the fuzztone solo on Donovan&#x27;s 1968 hit &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot;, but the solo was actually played by Alan Parker.

During the middle part of the decade, Holdsworth worked with various well-known progressive rock and jazz fusion artists, including Soft Machine (&quot;Bundles&quot; and &quot;Land of Cockayne)&quot;, The New Tony Williams Lifetime (&quot;Believe It&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot;), Pierre Moerlen&#x27;s Gong (&quot;Gazeuse!&quot;, &quot;Expresso II&quot; and &quot;Time is the Key&quot;), and Jean-Luc Ponty (&quot;Enigmatic Ocean&quot;), experiences he valued—especially his time spent with drummer Tony Williams. In 1976 came the first of Holdsworth&#x27;s many frustrations with the music industry, when CTI Records released a recording of what Holdsworth thought was a rehearsal session as an official studio album, &quot;Velvet Darkness&quot;. This angered Holdsworth, who said decades later that he still loathed the album intensely and wished it were never made public.

In 1977, Holdsworth was recruited by drummer and Yes original member Bill Bruford to play on his debut album, &quot;Feels Good to Me&quot; (released January 1978). Shortly afterwards, Bruford formed the progressive rock supergroup U.K. with keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson and bassist John Wetton; Holdsworth was brought in on the recommendation of Bruford. Despite getting along well with them personally and enjoying the recording of their 1978 self-titled album, Holdsworth claims that he &quot;detested&quot; his time spent with the group, and that it was &quot;miserable&quot; due to numerous musical differences whilst on tour, namely Jobson and Wetton&#x27;s desire for Holdsworth to play his solos to an organised structure for each show, something to which he vehemently objected.

Whilst U.K. continued with different musicians, Bruford returned to the core line-up of his solo band now simply named Bruford, with Holdsworth retained as guitarist. Their second album, &quot;One of a Kind&quot;, was released in 1979 and featured extensive contributions by Holdsworth, but by this point he wished to pursue his own musical aspirations and soon left the group, albeit with some reluctance.

===1980s===
Holdsworth&#x27;s first significant collaboration was with jazz pianist Gordon Beck on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Sunbird&quot; album in 1979. Their first collaborative release &quot;The Things You See&quot; followed in 1980, and was a largely similar effort but without percussion or bass. Soon afterwards, Holdsworth joined up with drummer Gary Husband and bassist Paul Carmichael in a trio that became known as False Alarm. This was Holdsworth&#x27;s first outing as a bandleader and, after the acquisition of former Tempest singer Paul Williams, the band was renamed I.O.U. Their self-titled debut album was released independently in 1982, followed by a mainstream reissue through Enigma Records in 1985.

Immediately after &quot;I.O.U.&quot;&#x27;s release, guitarist Eddie Van Halen brought Holdsworth to the attention of Warner Bros. Records executive Mo Ostin. Van Halen had previously enthused about Holdsworth in a 1980 issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, saying &quot;That guy is bad! He&#x27;s fantastic; I love him&quot;, and that Holdsworth was &quot;the best, in my book&quot;. Furthermore, in a 1981 interview for &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, he said that &quot;To me Allan Holdsworth is number one&quot;.

This resulted in the Warner Bros. release of &quot;Road Games&quot;, an EP, in 1983. It was produced by longtime Van Halen executive producer Ted Templeman, and received a nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 1984 Grammy Awards. Holdsworth, however, disliked &quot;Road Games&quot; because of creative differences with Templeman. Former Cream singer Jack Bruce provided vocals on &quot;Road Games&quot; (Holdsworth and Bruce had played together with Billy Cobham, Didier Lockwood and David Sancious under the name &quot;A Gathering of Minds&quot; at Montreux in 1982), whilst the later incarnation of the I.O.U. band consisted of Paul Williams, drummer Chad Wackerman (who, along with Husband, would become a regular Holdsworth bandmember for the next three decades) and bassist Jeff Berlin.

Having relocated permanently to Southern California and acrimoniously parted ways with Warner Bros., Holdsworth signed to Enigma for the 1985 release of &quot;Metal Fatigue&quot; (along with the aforementioned &quot;I.O.U.&quot; reissue). It was during this time that Flim &amp; the BB&#x27;s bassist Jimmy Johnson joined the band and, like Husband and Wackerman, remained a regular member of Holdsworth&#x27;s touring bands until his death. Making his last appearance on vocals was Paul Williams, with whom Holdsworth claimed to have fallen out due to the selling of live bootlegs by Williams.

The &quot;Atavachron&quot; album in 1986 was a landmark release in that it was the first to feature Holdsworth&#x27;s work with a brand new instrument named the SynthAxe. This unusually designed MIDI controller (different from a guitar synthesizer) would become a staple of Holdsworth&#x27;s playing for the rest of his recording career, during which he would effectively become the public face of the instrument. The next year saw the release of a fourth album, &quot;Sand&quot;, which featured no vocals and showcased further SynthAxe experimentation. A second collaboration with Gordon Beck, &quot;With a Heart in My Song&quot;, followed in 1988.

In the late 1980s, Holdsworth set up his own recording studio named The Brewery in North County, San Diego, which would become one of the main recording locations for all of his studio albums beginning with &quot;Secrets&quot; in 1989, and throughout the 1990s. In a 2005 interview, he stated that he no longer owned the studio following his divorce in 1999. &quot;Secrets&quot; introduced pianist Steve Hunt, who went on to play keyboard as a member of Holdsworth&#x27;s touring band, and for two further albums.

===1990s===
A collaboration in 1990 with fusion guitarist Frank Gambale came about in the form of &quot;Truth in Shredding&quot;, an ambitious collaborative project put together by Mark Varney (brother of Shrapnel Records founder Mike Varney) through his Legato Records label. In December of that year, following the death of Level 42 guitarist Alan Murphy in 1989, Holdsworth was recruited by the band to play as a guest musician during a series of concerts at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon. With former I.O.U. partner Gary Husband now being the drummer for Level 42, these circumstances all led to Holdsworth contributing guitar work on five tracks for their 1991 album, &quot;Guaranteed&quot;. Holdsworth also played on Chad Wackerman&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;Forty Reasons&quot; (1991) and &quot;The View&quot; (1993).

Holdsworth&#x27;s first solo album of the decade was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Wardenclyffe Tower&quot;, which continued to feature the SynthAxe but also displayed his newfound interest in self-designed baritone guitars built by luthier Bill DeLap. With the 1994 release of &quot;Hard Hat Area&quot;, Holdsworth&#x27;s touring band for that and the following year was composed of Steve Hunt, Husband and bassist Skúli Sverrisson. A collaboration in 1996 with brothers Anders and Jens Johansson resulted in &quot;Heavy Machinery&quot;, an album with more hard-edged playing from Holdsworth than was usual. In the same year, he was once again joined by Gordon Beck on &quot;None Too Soon&quot;, which contained interpretations of some of Holdsworth&#x27;s favourite jazz standards.

===2000s–2017===

The decade began positively with the release of &quot;The Sixteen Men of Tain&quot; in 2000, but it turned out to be Holdsworth&#x27;s last album recorded at The Brewery. Immediately afterwards, he abruptly slowed his solo output due to events in his personal life. A pair of official live albums, &quot;All Night Wrong&quot; and &quot;Then!&quot;, were released in 2002 and 2003 respectively, along with a double compilation album, &quot;The Best of Allan Holdsworth: Against the Clock&quot;, in 2005.

His eleventh album, &quot;Flat Tire: Music for a Non-Existent Movie&quot;, was released in 2001. In a 2008 interview Holdsworth mentioned that a new studio album entitled &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot; was slated for release in the same year through guitarist Steve Vai&#x27;s Favored Nations label, but this did not happen. Further new material with Chad Wackerman and Jimmy Johnson was also said to be in the works. In a 2010 interview he claimed to have enough material for two albums, which he planned to begin recording after a show in Tel Aviv.

Throughout the latter half of the 2000s he extensively toured both North America and Europe, and played as a guest on albums by numerous artists. Notably, he was featured on keyboardist Derek Sherinian&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Mythology&quot;, as well as with the latter&#x27;s progressive metal supergroup Planet X, on their 2007 album &quot;Quantum&quot;.

In 2006 and 2007 he performed with keyboardist Alan Pasqua, Wackerman and bassist Jimmy Haslip as part of a live tribute act in honour of the late Tony Williams, with whom Holdsworth and Pasqua had played in the mid-1970s; a DVD (&quot;Live at Yoshi&#x27;s&quot;) and double album (&quot;Blues for Tony&quot;) of this tour were released in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Throughout 2008–10 he toured with drummers Terry Bozzio and Pat Mastelotto, and bassist Tony Levin as HoBoLeMa, a supergroup playing improvised experimental music. On 3 November 2011, Holdsworth performed in Mumbai as part of drummer Virgil Donati&#x27;s touring band. The following year, Holdsworth joined Chad Wackerman for a third time on a studio album by the latter, for &quot;Dreams Nightmares and Improvisations&quot;.

In 2015, Holdsworth launched a PledgeMusic venture to release new studio material, as part of a collection named &quot;Tales from the Vault&quot;. The album appeared in July 2016.

On 7 April 2017, Manifesto records released the box set &quot;The Man Who Changed Guitar Forever! The Allan Holdsworth Album Collection&quot;, which comprises remastered versions of 12 of Allan&#x27;s solo albums. These 12 albums also have been released in a vinyl box set under the name &quot;The Allan Holdsworth Solo Album Collection&quot;, marking the first time many of these albums have been available on vinyl. At the same time, Manifesto also released the 2-CD compilation &quot;Eidolon&quot;, which features tracks selected by Holdsworth himself. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he played his final gig in San Diego on 10 April 2017.

===Posthumous releases===
Manifesto Records has released six posthumous albums as of 2022. All are archival live recordings sourced from jazz festivals or state broadcasters. Live in Japan 1984, released in 2018, is the first authorized release of the widely bootlegged &quot;Tokyo Dream&quot; laserdisc, with a limited edition bonus DVD. &quot;Warsaw Summer Jazz Days &#x27;98&quot;, released in 2019, contains a CD and DVD of a concert that was originally broadcast on Polish TV. 2020 saw the release of &quot;Frankfurt &#x27;86&quot;, a CD and DVD of Holdsworth&#x27;s 1986 appearance at the Deutsches Jazz Festival. In 2021 two different concert recordings from Holdsworth&#x27;s appearances at the Leverkusen Jazz Festival were released, the first from 1997 and the second from 2010. In 2022 Holdsworth&#x27;s 2014 appearance at the Jarasum International Jazz Festival in Korea was released.

Holdsworth also appears on two tracks on German artist MSM Schmidt&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Life&quot;, his latest studio recordings to be released as of 2019. Peter Lemer released the album &quot;Jet Yellow&quot; in 2019, featuring Holdsworth on the track &quot;Dognose&quot;. This album was however recorded in 1977.

==Compositions and style==
Holdsworth&#x27;s solo compositions are primarily instrumental, but vocals were prominent on all his 1980s albums except &quot;Sand&quot;. Two of his most recurring singers were Paul Williams (featured on &quot;I.O.U.&quot;, &quot;Road Games&quot; and &quot;Metal Fatigue&quot;) and Rowanne Mark (&quot;Atavachron&quot; and &quot;Secrets&quot;). Additionally, he sang lead vocals on &quot;Igginbottom&#x27;s Wrench&quot; and &quot;The Things You See&quot;, something he never did again. Early in his career he occasionally played violin (&quot;Velvet Darkness&quot;, &quot;Sunbird&quot;, &quot; Temorary Fault&quot;, &quot;The Things You See&quot;, &quot;I.O.U.&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Waved at Trains&quot; by Soft Machine and &quot;Upon Tomorrow&quot; by Tempest ) and on acoustic guitar: (&quot;Bundles&quot;, &quot;Velvet Darkness&quot;, &quot;U.K.&quot;, &quot;Gazeuse!&quot; and &quot;Metal Fatigue&quot;). He felt he was not proficient at acoustic guitar because its percussive tonal quality didn&#x27;t accommodate the kind of legato playing he favored.

Holdsworth&#x27;s playing style combined elements of jazz and progressive rock, and drew upon scale forms often derived from those such as the lydian, harmonic major, diminished, augmented, whole tone, chromatic and altered scales. In his instructional video for example he mentioned that he often played altered scales that are unusual to the average player, such as F minor major 7th with a raised 4th, while also displaying an ability to recognize such complex scales in chord form with voicings up and down the neck, with each note being a member of a family.

In his solos he extensively used various fast legato techniques such as slides, hammer-ons and pull-offs (the latter being a personalised method more akin to a &#x27;reversed&#x27; hammer-on); all of which produce a fluid lead sound. One of the reasons for his renowned emphasis on legato, as opposed to picking, stemmed from a desire to make the sound between picked and legato notes indistinguishable.

Another of his most identifiable traits was the use of rich, fingerpicked chords (often awash with delay, chorus and other complex effects), which were articulated and sustained using volume swells to create sounds reminiscent of the horn and saxophone. He said that he preferred both of these instruments to the guitar, the latter of which was not his first choice of instrument upon receiving one from his father when beginning to play music. It was because of this unfamiliarity with the guitar, combined with attempting to make it sound more like a saxophone, that he originally began to use legato without realising that it was not a common method of playing at the time. Furthermore, he was influenced greatly by such saxophonists as John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Michael Brecker and Charlie Parker, while some of his favourite guitarists were Django Reinhardt, Joe Pass, Wes Montgomery, Jimmy Raney, Charlie Christian and Hank Marvin.

==Influence and reception==
Holdsworth was highly influential among advanced guitarists and was considered one of the most technically accomplished and most unusual players. According to &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine he is &quot;as influential as Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen&quot;. Van Halen, Frank Zappa, Shawn Lane, Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Neal Schon and Gary Moore have proclaimed Holdsworth one of the most advanced guitarists of his time.

However, Holdsworth remained &quot;not well known outside musicians&#x27; circles&quot;, and was criticised, even by guitarists, for not being musical enough and being too technical for the average listener. Holdsworth himself understood that his music did not gel with the majority of people and said &quot;I don&#x27;t think everybody would like it, for sure. But if people got to hear it, if even 20% liked it, I would be really happy with that.&quot; He once approached a major record label and was told by its producer that his music was &quot;completely directionless,&quot; and how he did not approve of anything Holdsworth had ever done since he started making his own albums. Guthrie Govan has said of guitarists who aspire to play like Holdsworth: &quot;I think it&#x27;s potentially dangerous when a rock type player hears a bit of Allan Holdsworth or Frank Gambale and then dives straight into that style of playing; not only is the technical aspect daunting, there&#x27;s also all that musical knowledge and understanding going on behind the scenes, and it&#x27;s really hard to absorb both of those aspects at once without your playing just starting to sound worse.&quot;

Voivod guitarist Daniel Mongrain listed Holdsworth as &quot;the greatest prog rock guitarist of all-time&quot; in an interview, and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what he was doing – if it was either prog or jazz. He was a unique person – just the way he looked at things. And he reinvented musical theory in his own way – without getting the knowledge in school. He just analyzed it, internalized it, and he used it in his own perspective. And it created a very unique musical landscape. There will never be another Allan Holdsworth. And I&#x27;m not talking about his crazy legato technique or whatever. It&#x27;s just the whole thing – the harmony, the composition, the improvisation, the way he looks at the guitar, and music.&quot;

Following Holdsworth&#x27;s death, The Pods &amp; Sods Network released a three-part tribute podcast featuring many of his contemporaries, friends and fans sharing personal stories, memories and tributes. Participants included Steve Lukather, Jeff Watson, Chad Wackerman, Joe Satriani, Frank Gambale, Jean-Luc Ponty, Vernon Reid, Jennifer Batten, Dweezil Zappa, Ty Tabor, and Mike Keneally.

==Equipment==
===Guitars===

Holdsworth worked with many different guitar manufacturers as he developed his sound, which he felt he was never able to perfect throughout his career. From the late 1960s through to his time spent with Tony Williams in the mid-1970s, his main instrument was the Gibson SG. He then switched to playing custom Fender Stratocaster guitars that were modified with humbucker pickups.

During his time with Soft Machine in the 1970s, Holdsworth approached various luthiers in England to make him a fretless guitar. It is thought that Holdsworth&#x27;s incentive behind this approach was to achieve a greater level of legato. Holdsworth instead achieved this with use of the vibrato bar, by artificially adjusting the pitch while changing notes to achieve the desired fretless legato sound. This is also a technique by which Holdsworth was inspired by saxophonists, with large scoops in and out of phrases causing a jointed and smooth saxophone-like sound, without the need of a fretless guitar. With this revelation it is thought he abandoned the idea of the fretless guitar.

In 1984, Holdsworth developed his first signature guitars with Ibanez, known as the AH-10 and AH-20. They are Strat-style bodies with single pickup. These instruments have a semi-hollow body made from basswood with a hollow cavity underneath the pickguard, and can be heard on &quot;Metal Fatigue&quot; and &quot;Atavachron&quot;. He also developed a signature guitar with Charvel, also a single pickup guitar, called the &quot;Charvel Holdsworth Original&quot; which he played in the 1980s. His long association with Steinberger guitars began in 1987: these are made from graphite and carbon fibre, and distinctively have no headstock. With designer Ned Steinberger, he developed the GL2TA-AH signature model. He started playing customised headless guitars made by luthier Bill DeLap in the 1990s, which included an extended-range baritone model with a 38-inch scale length. However, he later said that he only owned one of the latter instruments (with a 34-inch scale). He also developed a line of signature guitars with Carvin Guitars, including the semi-hollow H2 in 1996, the completely hollow HF2 Fatboy in 1999, and the headless HH1 and HH2 models in 2013.

On &quot;Atavachron&quot;, Holdsworth first recorded with the SynthAxe—a fretted, guitar-like MIDI controller with keys, string triggers, and an additional tube-like input device named &#x27;Masters Touch&#x27; (designed by Nyle Steiner, inventor of the EWI) which dynamically alters volume and tone using breath velocity. Sound-wise, he used patches that were mainly Oberheim synthesizers. He used the SynthAxe on all solo releases from &quot;Atavachron&quot; onwards, but later said he no longer wanted it as such an integral part of his playing—especially live—mainly because of it being so rare (fewer than 100 units still exist), and difficult to maintain and repair as a result.

===Amplifiers===
Allan Holdsworth&#x27;s experimentation with amplifiers started early: &quot;My father&#x27;s friend built me my first amplifier. I used to love going to his place and watch him solder and such. This got me started in my interest in electronics.&quot;

Over the years, Allan Holdsworth used numerous amps, such as the Vox AC30 and a 50-watt Marshall with two 4x12 speaker cabinets. He liked the Marshalls for single-note soloing, but not for chords because of the resulting distortion. He also experimented with a couple of Norlin Lab Series L5, which he found too clean. He also used and endorsed Pearce amps, which were designed by an engineer who worked on Gibson&#x27;s Lab Series.

Other amps included Johnson amps, Mesa Boogie (Mark III, Boogie 295, Quad Preamp, or .50 Caliber) and a Carvin keyboard amp.

In his later career he transitioned to Hartley-Thompson amps, which in his opinion had a warm and clean sound. Guitarist Eddie Van Halen used Holdsworth&#x27;s modified Hartley-Thompson amplifier to record his solo on the 1982 song &quot;Beat It&quot; by Michael Jackson.

Holdsworth could also be seen performing with Yamaha DG80 112 digital modelling amps that he used in pairs: one for his clean sound and the other had a &#x27;crunch&#x27; preset with very little gain and a lot of master volume.

Holdsworth endorsed Hughes &amp; Kettner amplifiers. He used the TriAmp MKII and the ZenTera together with a Yamaha DG130 Power amp. and Fender Twins.

==Personal life==
Holdsworth lived in California from the early 1980s. Cycling was one of his favourite pastimes. He was also a keen beer aficionado, with a particular fondness for Northern English cask ale. He experimented with brewing his own beer in the 1990s, and invented a specialised beer pump named &quot;The Fizzbuster&quot;, which, in his own words, creates &quot;a beautiful creamy head.&quot;

Around 1986, Holdsworth struggled financially and occasionally sold equipment to make ends meet.

Holdsworth became a grandfather in December 2010, when his daughter Louise gave birth to a girl.

Holdsworth died on 15 April 2017 at his home in Vista, California, at the age of 70. Initially no cause of death was officially disclosed, however, news media later reported that he died of heart disease.

<doc id="328266" wikidata="Q5254788" url="?curid=328266" title="Delta and the Bannermen">
<text>Delta and the Bannermen is the third serial of the 24th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in three weekly parts from 2 to 16 November 1987.

In the serial, aliens called the Bannermen track down the Chimeron Queen Delta (Belinda Mayne) to a Welsh holiday camp in 1959 so they can kill her.

==Plot==
On an alien planet the genocide of the Chimeron by the merciless Bannermen led by Gavrok is almost complete. The last survivor, Chimeron Queen Delta, escapes clutching her egg. She reaches a space tollport where the Navarinos, a race of shape-changing tourist aliens, are planning a visit to Disneyland on the planet Earth in 1959, in a spaceship disguised as an old holiday bus. She stows aboard, meeting Mel, while the Seventh Doctor follows in the TARDIS. The holiday vehicle collides with an Earth satellite and is diverted off course, landing at a holiday camp in South Wales, led by camp director Burton. Delta&#x27;s egg hatches into a bright green baby that starts to grow at a startling rate. The Chimeron Queen supports this development with the equivalent of royal jelly given to bees.

Delta captures the heart of Billy, the camp&#x27;s mechanic, to the chagrin of Ray, who loves Billy herself. Ray confides her situation to the Doctor, and they stumble across a bounty hunter making contact with the Bannermen to tell them of the Chimeron&#x27;s whereabouts. Gavrok and his troops soon arrive. Delta and Billy head off for a picnic while the Doctor busies himself coordinating things back at the camp. Meanwhile, the Bannermen have destroyed the Navarino bus with all its passengers.

Two American CIA agents, Hawk and Weismuller, appear on the scene, tracking the missing satellite. Gavrok booby-traps the TARDIS in an attempt to kill the Doctor. A battle ensues with Gavrok and his Bannermen against the Doctor and his crew: Ray &amp; Billy, Goronwy, Mr. Burton and the two CIA agents. The Bannermen are foiled by honey, Goronwy&#x27;s bees and finally by the amplified scream of the Chimeron child Princess—a sound which is painful to Bannermen.

Goronwy explains to Billy the purpose of royal jelly in the lifecycle of the honeybee, provoking the mechanic to consume Delta&#x27;s equivalent that she has been feeding her daughter, in the hope of metamorphosing into a Chimeron.

As Gavrok and the Bannermen attack Shangri-La, the amplified scream of the Chimeron princess traumatises the attackers, including Gavrok, who becomes so stunned that he falls into the booby-trap he placed on the TARDIS and is killed. Delta and Billy leave together with the child, the two agents watch on with surprise and Goronwy winks knowingly as the Doctor and Mel slip away.

==Production==

===Pre-production===
The story was produced under the name &quot;Flight of the Chimeron&quot;. The eventual title is a reference to the British band Echo &amp; the Bunnymen.

The character Ray was created as a potential new companion for the Doctor, as Bonnie Langford was due to leave the series. The character of Ace was concurrently created for the following serial, &quot;Dragonfire&quot;, and ultimately chosen to continue over Ray.

===Filming and post-production===
The scenes at the Shangri-La holiday camp were shot on location at Butlin&#x27;s Barry Island in Wales.

The soundtrack of this serial contained numerous recognisable pop songs; all were re-recorded by &quot;The Lorells&quot;, a fictional group created by the show&#x27;s incidental music composer Keff McCulloch. The songs featured in the serial were: &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;; &quot;Singing the Blues&quot;; &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;; &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot;; &quot;Goodnite, Sweetheart, Goodnite&quot;; &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;; &quot;Only You&quot;; &quot;Lollipop&quot;; &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now?&quot; and &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;.

McCoy can be seen wearing his glasses in certain long shots of him riding a motorcycle. The motorbike was made by British manufacturer Vincent Motorcycles. The guitar McCoy is seen hugging at the end of the story is a Squier Stratocaster by Fender, although the model is not one available at the time the story was set.

===Cast notes===
The serial features guest appearances by Ken Dodd, Don Henderson, Hugh Lloyd, Morgan Deare, Richard Davies, and American stage and screen actor Stubby Kaye. Morgan Deare later played Senator Waldo Pickering in the audio play &quot;Minuet in Hell&quot; and Arthur in the new series episode &quot;Rosa&quot;. Dodd&#x27;s role of the tollmaster was originally offered to Bob Monkhouse and Christopher Biggins. According to McCoy, Dodd was uncertain of his performance during filming.

Lynn Gardner was cast as Ray, but was hospitalised while practising riding a Vespa for the role. Sara Griffiths took over as Ray in &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot;, while Gardner was cast in a voiceover role for the following story, &quot;Dragonfire&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==
Simon Brew of Den of Geek thought the story was &quot;fun nonsense.&quot; Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping enjoyed the serial, describing it as &quot;confident, slick, and hugely enjoyable from beginning to end&quot;. They praised Bonnie Langford&#x27;s performance, found Ken Dodd to be &quot;OK&quot; but thought Don Henderson played it too straight.

David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker found the serial to be even more whimsical than the preceding story but more successful, believing it was &quot;all in all, a highly enjoyable romp.&quot; For &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Mark Braxton awarded it three stars out of five, declaring, &quot;It&#x27;s mad as cheese and about as scary as an episode of &quot;Play Away&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t feel like &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for a second. But just once in a while the show can afford to go mad.&quot;

In 2015, Steven Moffat endorsed the fan theory that Goronwy is a future incarnation of the Doctor, and said that the idea fit well with the Doctor&#x27;s line about retiring to become a beekeeper in &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Kohll, was published by Target Books in January 1989. The novelisation provides an explanation for why the genocide of the Chimeron race is taking place; the Bannerman have polluted the atmosphere and rivers of their own home planet, so they are attempting to seize the Chimeron&#x27;s homeworld for themselves.

It was released on audiobook, read by Bonnie Langford.

===Home media===
&quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot; was released on VHS in March 2001 in the UK and June 2002 in North America, but music clearance issues prevented the release of the serial in Australia. A DVD edition was released in the UK on 22 June 2009. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 62 on 18 May 2011.

In June 2021 it was released as part of the Doctor Who: The Collection Season 24 blu-ray box set, which includes an optional extended cut of all three episodes.

<text>Palynology is the study of microorganisms and microscopic fragments of mega-organisms that are composed of acid-resistant organic material and occur in sediments, sedimentary rocks, and even some metasedimentary rocks. Palynomorphs are the microscopic, acid-resistant organic remains and debris produced by a wide variety of plants, animals, and Protista that have existed since the late Proterozoic. 

It is the science that studies contemporary and fossil palynomorphs (paleopalynology), including pollen, spores, orbicules, dinocysts, acritarchs, chitinozoans and scolecodonts, together with particulate organic matter (POM) and kerogen found in sedimentary rocks and sediments. Palynology does not include diatoms, foraminiferans or other organisms with siliceous or calcareous tests. The name of the science and organisms is derived from the Greek , &quot;strew, sprinkle&quot; and &quot;-logy&quot;) or of &quot;particles that are strewn&quot;.

Palynology is an interdisciplinary science that stands at the intersection of earth science (geology or geological science) and biological science (biology), particularly plant science (botany). Biostratigraphy, a branch of paleontology and paleobotany, involves fossil palynomorphs from the Precambrian to the Holocene for their usefulness in the relative dating and correlation of sedimentary strata. Palynology is also used to date and understand the evolution of many kinds of plants and animals. In paleoclimatology, fossil palynomorphs are studied for their usefulness in understanding ancient Earth history in terms of reconstructing paleoenvironments and paleoclimates.

Palynology is quite useful in disciplines such as archeology, in honey production, and criminal and civil law. In archaeology, palynology is widely used to reconstruct ancient paleoenvironments and environmental shifts that significantly influenced past human societies and reconstruct the diet of prehistoric and historic humans. Melissopalynology, the study of pollen and other palynomorphs in honey, identifies the sources of pollen in terms of geographical location(s) and genera of plants. This not only provides important information on the ecology of honey bees, it also an important tool in discovering and policing the criminal adultriation and mislabeling of honey and its products. Forensic palynology uses palynomorphs as evidence in criminal and civil law to prove or disprove a physical link between objects, people, and places.

== Palynomorphs ==
Palynomorphs are broadly defined as the study of organic remains, including microfossils, and microscopic fragments of mega-organisms that are composed of acid-resistant organic material and range in size between 5 and 500 micrometres. They are extracted from soils, sedimentary rocks and sediment cores, and other materials by a combination of physical (ultrasonic treatment and wet sieving) and chemical (acid digestion) procedures to remove the non-organic fraction. Palynomorphs may be composed of organic material such as chitin, pseudochitin and sporopollenin.

Palynomorphs form a geological record of importance in determining the type of prehistoric life that existed at the time the sedimentary strata was laid down. As a result, these microfossils give important clues to the prevailing climatic conditions of the time. Their paleontological utility derives from an abundance numbering in millions of palynomorphs per gram in organic marine deposits, even when such deposits are generally not fossiliferous. Palynomorphs, however, generally have been destroyed in metamorphic or recrystallized rocks.

Typical palynomorphs include dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs, spores, pollen, plant tissue, fungi, scolecodonts (scleroprotein teeth, jaws, and associated features of polychaete annelid worms), arthropod organs (such as insect mouthparts), and chitinozoans. Palynomorph microscopic structures that are abundant in most sediments are resistant to routine pollen extraction.

== Palynofacies ==
A palynofacies is the complete assemblage of organic matter and palynomorphs in a fossil deposit. The term was introduced by the French geologist in 1964. Palynofacies studies are often linked to investigations of the organic geochemistry of sedimentary rocks. The study of the palynofacies of a sedimentary depositional environment can be used to learn about the depositional palaeoenvironments of sedimentary rocks in exploration geology, often in conjunction with palynological analysis and vitrinite reflectance.

Palynofacies can be used in two ways:
* Organic palynofacies considers all the acid insoluble particulate organic matter (POM), including kerogen and palynomorphs in sediments and palynological preparations of sedimentary rocks. The sieved or unsieved preparations may be examined using strew mounts on microscope slides that may be examined using a transmitted light biological microscope or ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence microscope. The abundance, composition and preservation of the various components, together with the thermal alteration of the organic matter is considered.
* Palynomorph palynofacies considers the abundance, composition and diversity of palynomorphs in a sieved palynological preparation of sediments or palynological preparation of sedimentary rocks. The ratio of marine fossil phytoplankton (acritarchs and dinoflagellate cysts), together with chitinozoans, to terrestrial palynomorphs (pollen and spores) can be used to derive a terrestrial input index in marine sediments.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest reported observations of pollen under a microscope are likely to have been in the 1640s by the English botanist Nehemiah Grew, who described pollen and the stamen, and concluded that pollen is required for sexual reproduction in flowering plants.

By the late 1870s, as optical microscopes improved and the principles of stratigraphy were worked out, Robert Kidston and P. Reinsch were able to examine the presence of fossil spores in the Devonian and Carboniferous coal seams and make comparisons between the living spores and the ancient fossil spores. Early investigators include Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (radiolarians, diatoms and dinoflagellate cysts), Gideon Mantell (desmids) and Henry Hopley White (dinoflagellate cysts).

=== 1890s to 1940s===
Quantitative analysis of pollen began with Lennart von Post&#x27;s published work. Although he published in the Swedish language, his methodology gained a wide audience through his lectures. In particular, his Kristiania lecture of 1916 was important in gaining a wider audience. Because the early investigations were published in the Nordic languages (Scandinavian languages), the field of pollen analysis was confined to those countries. The isolation ended with the German publication of Gunnar Erdtman&#x27;s 1921 thesis. The methodology of pollen analysis became widespread throughout Europe and North America and revolutionized Quaternary vegetation and climate change research.

Earlier pollen researchers include Früh (1885), who enumerated many common tree pollen types, and a considerable number of spores and herb pollen grains. There is a study of pollen samples taken from sediments of Swedish lakes by Trybom (1888); pine and spruce pollen was found in such profusion that he considered them to be serviceable as &quot;index fossils&quot;. Georg F. L. Sarauw studied fossil pollen of middle Pleistocene age (Cromerian) from the harbour of Copenhagen. Lagerheim (in Witte 1905) and C. A.Weber (in H. A. Weber 1918) appear to be among the first to undertake &#x27;percentage frequency&#x27; calculations.

=== 1940s to 1989===

The term &quot;palynology&quot; was introduced by Hyde and Williams in 1944, following correspondence with the Swedish geologist Ernst Antevs, in the pages of the &quot;Pollen Analysis Circular&quot; (one of the first journals devoted to pollen analysis, produced by Paul Sears in North America). Hyde and Williams chose &quot;palynology&quot; on the basis of the Greek words &quot;paluno&quot; meaning &#x27;to sprinkle&#x27; and &quot;pale&quot; meaning &#x27;dust&#x27; (and thus similar to the Latin word &quot;pollen&quot;). The archive-based background to the adoption of the term &quot;palynology&quot; and to alternative names (e.g. &quot;paepalology&quot;, &quot;pollenology&quot;) has been exhaustively explored. It has been argued there that the word gained general acceptance once used by the influential Swedish palynologist Gunnar Erdtman. 

Pollen analysis in North America stemmed from Phyllis Draper, an MS student under Sears at the University of Oklahoma. During her time as a student, she developed the first pollen diagram from a sample that depicted the percentage of several species at different depths at Curtis Bog. This was the introduction of pollen analysis in North America; pollen diagrams today still often remain in the same format with depth on the y-axis and abundances of species on the x-axis.

=== 1990s to the 21st century ===
Pollen analysis advanced rapidly in this period due to advances in optics and computers. Much of the science was revised by Johannes Iversen and Knut Fægri in their textbook on the subject.

== Methods of studying palynomorphs ==
===Chemical preparation===
Chemical digestion follows a number of steps. Initially the only chemical treatment used by researchers was treatment with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to remove humic substances; defloculation was accomplished through surface treatment or ultra-sonic treatment, although sonification may cause the pollen exine to rupture. In 1924, the use of hydrofluoric acid (HF) to digest silicate minerals was introduced by Assarson and Granlund, greatly reducing the amount of time required to scan slides for palynomorphs. 

Palynological studies using peats presented a particular challenge because of the presence of well-preserved organic material, including fine rootlets, moss leaflets and organic litter. This was the last major challenge in the chemical preparation of materials for palynological study. Acetolysis was developed by Gunnar Erdtman and his brother to remove these fine cellulose materials by dissolving them. In acetolysis the specimen is treated with acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid, dissolving cellulistic materials and thus providing better visibility for palynomorphs.

Some steps of the chemical treatments require special care for safety reasons, in particular the use of HF which diffuses very fast through the skin and, causes severe chemical burns, and can be fatal.

Another treatment includes kerosene flotation for chitinous materials.

===Analysis===
Once samples have been prepared chemically, they are mounted on microscope slides using silicon oil, glycerol or glycerol-jelly and examined using light microscopy or mounted on a stub for scanning electron microscopy.

Researchers will often study either modern samples from a number of unique sites within a given area, or samples from a single site with a record through time, such as samples obtained from peat or lake sediments. More recent studies have used the modern analog technique in which paleo-samples are compared to modern samples for which the parent vegetation is known.

When the slides are observed under a microscope, the researcher counts the number of grains of each pollen taxon. This record is next used to produce a pollen diagram. These data can be used to detect anthropogenic effects, such as logging, traditional patterns of land use or long term changes in regional climate

== Applications ==
Palynology can be applied to problems in many scientific disciplines including geology, botany, paleontology, archaeology, pedology (soil study), and physical geography:

* Biostratigraphy and geochronology. Geologists use palynological studies in biostratigraphy to correlate strata and determine the relative age of a given bed, horizon, formation or stratigraphical sequence. Because the distribution of acritarchs, chitinozoans, dinoflagellate cysts, pollen and spores provides evidence of stratigraphical correlation through biostratigraphy and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, one common and lucrative application of palynology is in oil and gas exploration.
* Paleoecology and climate change. Palynology can be used to reconstruct past vegetation (land plants) and marine and Freshwater phytoplankton communities, and so infer past environmental (palaeoenvironmental) and palaeoclimatic conditions in an area thousands or millions of years ago, a fundamental part of research into climate change.
* Organic palynofacies studies, which examine the preservation of the particulate organic matter and palynomorphs provides information on the depositional environment of sediments and depositional palaeoenvironments of sedimentary rocks.
* Geothermal alteration studies examine the colour of palynomorphs extracted from rocks to give the thermal alteration and maturation of sedimentary sequences, which provides estimates of maximum palaeotemperatures.
* Limnology studies. Freshwater palynomorphs and animal and plant fragments, including the prasinophytes and desmids (green algae) can be used to study past lake levels and long term climate change.
* Taxonomy and evolutionary studies. Involving the use of pollen morphological characters as source of taxonomic data to delimit plant species under same family or genus. Pollen apertural status is frequently used for differential sorting or finding similarities between species of the same taxa. This is also called Palynotaxonomy.
* Forensic palynology: the study of pollen and other palynomorphs for evidence at a crime scene.
* Allergy studies and pollen counting. Studies of the geographic distribution and seasonal production of pollen, can be used to forecast pollen conditions, helping sufferers of allergies such as hay fever.
* Melissopalynology: the study of pollen and spores found in honey.
* Archaeological palynology examines human uses of plants in the past. This can help determine seasonality of site occupation, presence or absence of agricultural practices or products, and &#x27;plant-related activity areas&#x27; within an archaeological context. Bonfire Shelter is one such example of this application.

<text>John McLaughlin (born 4 January 1942), also known as Mahavishnu, is an English guitarist, bandleader, and composer. A pioneer of jazz fusion, his music combines elements of jazz with rock, world music, Western classical music, flamenco, and blues.
After contributing to several key British groups of the early 1960s, McLaughlin made &quot;Extrapolation&quot;, his first album as a bandleader, in 1969. He then moved to the U.S., where he played with drummer Tony Williams&#x27;s group Lifetime and then with Miles Davis on his electric jazz fusion albums &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, &quot;Jack Johnson&quot;, &quot;Live-Evil&quot;, and &quot;On the Corner&quot;. His 1970s electric band, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, performed a technically virtuosic and complex style of music that fused electric jazz and rock with Indian influences.

McLaughlin&#x27;s solo on &quot;Miles Beyond&quot; from his album &quot;Live at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s&quot; won the 2018 Grammy Award for the Best Improvised Jazz Solo. He has been awarded multiple &quot;Guitarist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Jazz Guitarist&quot; awards from magazines such as &quot;DownBeat&quot; and &quot;Guitar Player&quot; based on reader polls. In 2003, he was ranked 49th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In 2009, &quot;DownBeat&quot; included McLaughlin in its unranked list of &quot;75 Great Guitarists&quot;, in the &quot;Modern Jazz Maestros&quot; category. In 2012, &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine ranked him 63rd on its top 100 list. In 2010, Jeff Beck called McLaughlin &quot;the best guitarist alive&quot;, and Pat Metheny has also described him as the world&#x27;s greatest guitarist. In 2017, McLaughlin was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music.

==Biography==
===1960s===
John McLaughlin was born on 4 January 1942 to a family of musicians in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. His mother Mary was a concert violinist; his father John, of Irish descent, was an engineer. The younger John McLaughlin was predominantly raised by his mother and grandmother; his father, the elder John, had separated from Mary when he was 7 years old. The younger John did not have a relationship with his father for most of his life, until in the late 1970s when he contacted his father and took him out to a pub. The younger John said of the experience, &quot;Without my dad, I wouldn&#x27;t be here. At least I had closure, and for that I thank my lucky stars&quot;; His father later died from a heart attack. Also, at the age of 7, the younger John McLaughlin heard classical music on the phonograph, and considered it a &quot;message to my heart and soul more than anything&quot;; this motivated him to become a musician.

McLaughlin studied violin and piano as a child; At the age of 11, his brother gave John a guitar and John immediately took up the instrument, exploring styles from flamenco to the jazz of Tal Farlow, Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli. He moved to London from Yorkshire in the early 1960s, playing with Alexis Korner and the Marzipan Twisters before moving on to Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, the Graham Bond Quartet (in 1963) and Brian Auger. During the 1960s, he often supported himself with session work, which he frequently found unsatisfying but which enhanced his playing and sight-reading. Also, he gave guitar lessons to Jimmy Page. In 1963, Jack Bruce formed the Graham Bond Quartet with Bond, Ginger Baker and John McLaughlin. They played an eclectic range of music genres, including bebop, blues and rhythm.

Graham Bond was McLaughlin&#x27;s first spiritual influence. Bond would introduce McLaughlin to Indian culture, philosophy, and religious esoteric practices, which McLaughlin stated &quot;triggered a desire to know&quot;, while under the influence of drugs. The Graham Bond Quartet was not well received financially and critically; McLaughlin quit the group. 

By 1966, while working in pop and jazz sessions, McLaughlin observed the personal tragedies of those of his musical peers who succumbed to drug addictions and death. As a response, McLaughlin would gradually stop using drugs and pursue a spiritual lifestyle, which would be a recurring motif of his music career. At the same time, McLaughlin experienced a profound musical revelation when psychedelic music was in vogue: he inferred that this music raised existential questions and insisted that he was &quot;on the same boat&quot; as those who sought answers to such questions, which further motivated his interests in Indian culture and its classical music. For a time, in 1968, McLaughlin would be involved in the free jazz scene with musician Gunter Hampel; McLaughlin described this experience as &quot;devastating&quot; and &quot;anarchistic&quot;, but appreciated the free-form aspect of the genre. McLaughlin would later state in a July 2024 interview for JazzTimes that his experience with Hampel was &quot;self-indulgent&quot; and that he needed &quot;structure ... the more restraints I put on myself, the happier I felt.&quot;

In January 1969, McLaughlin recorded his debut album &quot;Extrapolation&quot; in London. It prominently features John Surman on saxophone and Tony Oxley on drums. McLaughlin composed the number &quot;Binky&#x27;s Beam&quot; as a tribute to his friend, the innovative bass player Binky McKenzie. The album&#x27;s post-bop style is quite different from McLaughlin&#x27;s later fusion works, though it gradually developed a strong reputation among critics by the mid-1970s.

McLaughlin moved to the U.S. in 1969 to join Tony Williams&#x27; group Lifetime. A recording from the Record Plant, NYC, dated 25 March 1969, exists of McLaughlin jamming with Jimi Hendrix. McLaughlin recollects &quot;we played one night, just a jam session. And we played from 2 until 8, in the morning. I thought it was a wonderful experience! I was playing an acoustic guitar with a pick-up. Um, flat-top guitar, and Jimi was playing an electric. Yeah, what a lovely time! Had he lived today, you&#x27;d find that he would be employing everything he could get his hands on, and I mean acoustic guitar, synthesizers, orchestras, voices, anything he could get his hands on he&#x27;d use!&quot;

He played on Miles Davis&#x27; albums &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (which has a track titled after him), &quot;Live-Evil&quot;, &quot;On the Corner&quot;, &quot;Big Fun&quot; (where he is featured soloist on &quot;Go Ahead John&quot;) and &quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot;. In the liner notes to &quot;Jack Johnson&quot;, Davis called McLaughlin&#x27;s playing &quot;far in&quot;. McLaughlin returned to the Davis band for one night of a week-long club date, recorded and released as part of the album &quot;Live-Evil&quot; and of the &quot;Cellar Door&quot; boxed set. His reputation as a &quot;first-call&quot; session player grew, resulting in recordings as a sideman with Miroslav Vitous, Larry Coryell, Joe Farrell, Wayne Shorter, Carla Bley, the Rolling Stones, and others.

===1970s===

He recorded &quot;Devotion&quot; in early 1970 for Douglas Records (run by Alan Douglas), a high-energy, psychedelic fusion album that featured Larry Young on organ (who had been part of Lifetime), Billy Rich on bass and the R&amp;B drummer Buddy Miles. &quot;Devotion&quot; was the first of two albums he released on Douglas. In 1971 he released &quot;My Goal&#x27;s Beyond&quot; in the US, a collection of unamplified acoustic works. Side A (&quot;Peace One&quot; and &quot;Peace Two&quot;) offers a fusion blend of jazz and Indian classical forms, while side B features melodic acoustic playing on such standards as &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&quot;, by Charles Mingus whom McLaughlin considered an important influence. &quot;My Goal&#x27;s Beyond&quot; was inspired by McLaughlin&#x27;s decision to follow the Indian spiritual leader Sri Chinmoy, to whom he had been introduced in 1970 by Larry Coryell&#x27;s manager. The album was dedicated to Chinmoy, with one of the Guru&#x27;s poems printed on the liner notes. It was on this album that McLaughlin took the name &quot;Mahavishnu&quot;.

In 1973, McLaughlin collaborated with Carlos Santana, also a disciple of Sri Chinmoy at the time, on an album of devotional songs, &quot;Love Devotion Surrender&quot;, which featured recordings of Coltrane compositions including a movement of &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. McLaughlin has also worked with the jazz composers Carla Bley and Gil Evans.

====The Mahavishnu Orchestra====
McLaughlin&#x27;s 1970s electric band, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, included violinist Jerry Goodman, keyboardist Jan Hammer, bassist Rick Laird, and drummer Billy Cobham. They performed a technically difficult and complex style of music that fused electric jazz and rock with Eastern and Indian influences. This band helped establish fusion as a new and growing style. McLaughlin&#x27;s playing at this time was distinguished by fast solos and non-western musical scales.

The first incarnation of the Mahavishnu Orchestra split in late 1973 after two years and three albums, including a live recording &quot;Between Nothingness &amp; Eternity&quot;, due to personality clashes and overwork imposed by their management; Jan Hammer and Jerry Goodman were among the outspoken members who disputed with McLaughlin&#x27;s leadership, religious beliefs and songwriting credits. Upon reading an article from Crawdaddy Magazine en route to Japan for a tour, McLaughlin was offended by the writeups and disparagement of his religious beliefs. Goodman reconciled with McLaughlin, several years after the breakup. In 1999 the &quot;Lost Trident Sessions&quot; album was released; recorded in 1973 but shelved when the group disbanded. 

McLaughlin then reformed the group with Narada Michael Walden (drums), Jean-Luc Ponty (violin), Ralphe Armstrong (bass), and Gayle Moran (keyboards and vocals), and a string and horn section (McLaughlin referred to this as &quot;the real Mahavishnu Orchestra&quot;). This incarnation of the group recorded two albums, &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, with the London Symphony Orchestra, and &quot;Visions of the Emerald Beyond&quot;. During the second lineup, McLaughlin had a double-neck electric guitar built by Rex Bogue. When the guitar broke, in a tour for &quot;Visions of the Emerald Beyond&quot;, McLaughlin began to have a musical and spiritual crisis; He became disillusioned with the teachings of Sri Chinmoy and eventually disavowed Chinmoy&#x27;s teachings. McLaughlin stated in 1976 for &quot;People Magazine&quot;, &quot;I love [Sri Chinmoy] very much, but I must assume responsibility for my own actions&quot;. A scaled-down quartet was formed with McLaughlin, Walden on drums, Armstrong on bass and Stu Goldberg on keyboards and synthesiser, for their final album in the 1970s, &quot;Inner Worlds&quot;, which was released on February 1976, largely due to contractual obligations.

====Shakti====
McLaughlin then became absorbed in his acoustic playing with his Indian classical music based group Shakti (energy). McLaughlin had already been studying Indian classical music and playing the veena for several years. The group featured Lakshminarayanan L. Shankar (violin), Zakir Hussain (tabla), Thetakudi Harihara Vinayakram (ghatam) and earlier Ramnad Raghavan (mridangam). The group recorded three albums: &quot;Shakti with John McLaughlin&quot; (1975)
&quot;A Handful of Beauty&quot; (1976), and &quot;Natural Elements&quot; (1977). Based on both Carnatic and Hindustani styles, along with extended use of konnakol, the band introduced ragas and Indian percussion to many jazz aficionados.

In this group McLaughlin played a custom-made steel-string J-200 acoustic guitar made by Abe Wechter and the Gibson guitar company that featured two tiers of strings over the soundhole: a conventional six-string configuration and seven strings strung underneath at a 45-degree angle – these were independently tuneable &quot;sympathetic strings&quot; much like those on a sitar or veena. The instrument&#x27;s vina-like scalloped fretboard enabled McLaughlin to bend strings far beyond the reach of a conventional fretboard. McLaughlin grew so accustomed to the freedom it provided him that he had the fretboard scalloped on his Gibson Byrdland electric guitar.

====Other activities====
In 1979, McLaughlin formed a short-lived funk fusion power trio named Trio of Doom with drummer Tony Williams and bassist Jaco Pastorius. Their only live performance was on 3 March 1979 at the Havana Jam Festival (2–4 March 1979) in Cuba, part of a US State Department sponsored visit to Cuba. Later on 8 March 1979, the group recorded the songs they had written for the festival at CBS Studios in New York, on 52nd Street. Recollections from this performance are captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos&#x27;s documentary &quot;Havana Jam &#x27;79&quot; and the archival album, &quot;Trio of Doom&quot;. McLaughlin also appeared on Stanley Clarke&#x27;s &quot;School Days&quot; and numerous other fusion albums. 

The same year, McLaughlin teamed up with flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía and jazz guitarist Larry Coryell (replaced by Al Di Meola in the early 1980s) as the Guitar Trio. For the tour of fall 1983 they were joined by Dixie Dregs guitarist Steve Morse who opened the show as a soloist and participated with The Trio in the closing numbers. The Trio reunited in 1996 for a second recording session and a world tour. Also in 1979 McLaughlin recorded the album &quot;Johnny McLaughlin: Electric Guitarist&quot;, the title on McLaughlin&#x27;s first business cards as a teenager in Yorkshire. This was a return to more mainstream jazz/rock fusion and to the electric instrument after three years of playing acoustic guitars.

===1980s===
The short-lived One Truth Band recorded one studio album, &quot;Electric Dreams&quot;, with L. Shankar on violins, Stu Goldberg on keyboards, Fernando Saunders on electric bass and Tony Smith on drums. After the dissolution of the One Truth Band, McLaughlin toured in a guitar duo with Christian Escoudé.

With the group Fuse One, he released two albums in 1980 and 1982.

In 1981 and 1982, McLaughlin recorded two albums, &quot;Belo Horizonte&quot; and &quot;Music Spoken Here&quot; with The Translators, a band of French and American musicians who combined acoustic guitar, bass, drums, saxophone, and violin with synthesizers. The Translators included McLaughlin&#x27;s then-girlfriend, classical pianist Katia Labèque.

From 1984 through to (circa) 1987, an electric five-piece operated under the name &quot;Mahavishnu&quot; (omitting the &quot;Orchestra&quot;). Two LPs were released, &quot;Mahavishnu&quot; and &quot;Adventures in Radioland&quot;. The former featured McLaughlin making extensive use of the Synclavier synthesizer, allied with a Roland guitar/controller. The first of the two albums was recorded with a line-up of McLaughlin, Bill Evans (saxophones), Jonas Hellborg (bass), Mitchel Forman (keyboards) and both Danny Gottlieb and Billy Cobham on drums. Initial advertising for concert dates in support of the album included Cobham&#x27;s name, but by the time the tour started in earnest, Gottlieb was in the band. Forman left at some point between the albums, and was replaced on keyboards by Jim Beard.

In tandem with Mahavishnu, McLaughlin worked in duo format ( 1985–87) with bassist Jonas Hellborg, playing a number of concert dates, some of which were broadcast on radio and TV, but no commercial recordings were made.

In 1986, he appeared with Dexter Gordon in Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s film &quot;Round Midnight&quot;. He also composed The Mediterranean Concerto, orchestrated by Michael Gibbs. The world premier featured McLaughlin and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. It was recorded in 1988 with Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the London Symphony Orchestra. Unlike what is typical practice in classical music, the concerto includes sections where McLaughlin improvises. Also included on the recording were five duets between McLaughlin and his then-girlfriend Katia Labèque.

In the late 1980s, McLaughlin began performing live and recording with a trio including percussionist Trilok Gurtu, and three bassists at various times; firstly Jeff Berlin, then Kai Eckhardt and finally Dominique Di Piazza. Berlin contributed to the trio&#x27;s live work only in 1988/89, and didn&#x27;t record with McLaughlin. The group recorded two albums: &quot;Live at The Royal Festival Hall&quot; and &quot;Que Alegria&quot;, the former with Eckhardt, and the latter with di Piazza for all but two tracks. These recordings saw a return to acoustic instruments for McLaughlin, performing on nylon-string guitar. On &quot;Live at the Royal Festival Hall&quot; McLaughlin used a unique guitar synth that enabled him to effectively &quot;loop&quot; guitar parts and play over them live. The synth also featured a pedal that provided sustain. McLaughlin overdubbed parts to create lush soundscapes, aided by Gurtu&#x27;s unique percussive sounds. He used this approach to great effect in the track &quot;Florianapolis&quot;, among others.

===1990s===

In the early 1990s, he toured with his trio on the &quot;Qué Alegría&quot; album. By this time, Eckhardt had left, with McLaughlin and Gurtu joined by bass player Dominique Di Piazza. In the latter stages of this trio&#x27;s life, they were joined on tour by Katia Labèque alone, or by Katia and her sister Marielle, with footage of the latter configuration forming part of a documentary on the Labèque Sisters. Following this period he recorded and toured with The Heart of Things featuring Gary Thomas, Dennis Chambers, Matt Garrison, Jim Beard and Otmaro Ruíz. In 1993 he released a Bill Evans tribute album entitled &quot;Time Remembered: John McLaughlin Plays Bill Evans&quot;, with McLaughlin&#x27;s acoustic guitar backed by the acoustic guitars of the Aighetta Quartet and the acoustic bass of Yan Maresz. 

In 1994, McLaughlin and Trilok Gurtu composed the soundtrack to the drama film &quot;Molom, conte de Mongolie&quot;, directed by Marie-Jaoul de Poncheville. The film was praised for its visual aspects, authenticity and acting by outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;; Conversely, reception to the soundtrack was mixed, as &quot;Variety&quot; considered McLaughlin and Gurtu&#x27;s score &quot;too contemporary to mesh&quot;, while remarking that the Mongolian folk music in the soundtrack was &quot;pleasant&quot;.

McLaughlin formed a group, Remember Shakti and toured with them; In addition to original Shakti member Zakir Hussain, this group has also featured eminent Indian musicians U. Srinivas, V. Selvaganesh, Shankar Mahadevan, Shivkumar Sharma, and Hariprasad Chaurasia. In 1996, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia and Al Di Meola (known collectively as &quot;The Guitar Trio&quot;) reunited for a world tour and recorded an album of the same name. They had previously released a studio album entitled &quot;Passion, Grace &amp; Fire&quot; back in 1983. Meanwhile, in the same year of 1996 McLaughlin recorded &quot;The Promise&quot;. Also notable during the period were his performances with Elvin Jones and Joey DeFrancesco.

===2000s===
In 2003, he recorded a ballet score, &quot;Thieves and Poets&quot;, along with arrangements for classical guitar ensemble of favourite jazz standards and a three-DVD instructional video on improvisation entitled &quot;This is the Way I Do It&quot; (which contributed to the development of video lessons.) In June 2006 he released the post-bop/jazz fusion album &quot;Industrial Zen&quot;, on which he experimented with the Godin Glissentar as well as continuing to expand his guitar-synth repertoire.

In 2007, he left Universal Records and joined Abstract Logix. Recording sessions for his first album on that label took place in April. That summer, he began touring with a new jazz fusion quartet, the 4th Dimension, consisting of keyboardist/drummer Gary Husband, bassist Hadrian Feraud, and drummer Mark Mondesir. During the 4th Dimension&#x27;s tour, an &quot;instant CD&quot; entitled &quot;Live USA 2007: Official Bootleg&quot; was made available comprising soundboard recordings of six pieces from the group&#x27;s first performance. Following completion of the tour, McLaughlin sorted through recordings from each night to release a second MP3 download-only collection entitled, &quot;Official Pirate: Best of the American Tour 2007&quot;. During this time, McLaughlin also released another instructional DVD, &quot;The Gateway to Rhythm&quot;, featuring Indian percussionist and Remember Shakti bandmate Selva Ganesh Vinayakram (or V. Selvaganesh), focusing on the Indian rhythmic system of konnakol. McLaughlin also remastered and released the shelved 1979 Trio of Doom project with Jaco Pastorius and Tony Williams. The project had been aborted due to conflicts between Williams and Pastorius as well as what was at the time a mutual dissatisfaction with the results of their performance.

On 28 July 2007, McLaughlin performed at Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival in Bridgeview, Illinois.
On 28 April 2008, the recording sessions from the previous year surfaced on the album &quot;Floating Point&quot;, featuring the rhythm section of keyboardist Louis Banks, bassist Hadrien Feraud, percussionist Sivamani and drummer Ranjit Barot bolstered on each track by a different Indian musician. Coinciding with the release of the album was another DVD, &quot;Meeting of the Minds&quot;, which offered behind the scenes studio footage of the &quot;Floating Point&quot; sessions as well as interviews with all of the musicians. He engaged in a late summer/fall 2008 tour with Chick Corea, Vinnie Colaiuta, Kenny Garrett and Christian McBride under the name Five Peace Band, from which came an eponymous double-CD live album in early 2009.

McLaughlin performed with Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Billy Cobham at the 44th Montreux Jazz Festival, in Montreux, Switzerland, on 2 July 2010, for the first time since the band split up. In November 2010, a book was released by Abstract Logix Books entitled &quot;Follow Your Heart - John McLaughlin Song by Song&quot; by Walter Kolosky, who also wrote the book &quot;Power, Passion and Beauty – The Story of the Legendary Mahavishnu Orchestra&quot;. The book discussed each song McLaughlin wrote and contained photographs never seen before.

==Artistry==
John McLaughlin is a leading guitarist in jazz and jazz fusion. His style has been described as one that incorporates aggressive speed, technical precision, and harmonic sophistication. He is known for using non-Western scales and unconventional time signatures. Indian music has had a profound influence on his style, and he has been described as one of the first Westerners to play Indian music to Indian audiences. He was influential in bringing jazz fusion to popularity with Miles Davis, playing with Davis on five of his studio albums, including Davis&#x27; first gold-certified &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, and one live album, &quot;Live-Evil&quot;. Speaking of himself, McLaughlin has stated that the guitar is simply &quot;part of his body&quot;, and he feels more comfortable when a guitar is present.

Although a successful and critically acclaimed artist, McLaughlin&#x27;s rapid-fire alternate picking and unorthodox note choices drew some criticism, especially in the 1970s. Frank Zappa, who toured with the Mahavishnu Orchestra in May 1973, made some back-handed compliments to the English player:
Decades later, John McLaughlin issued a rebuke to Zappa&#x27;s &quot;machine gun&quot; comment. Although he conceded that Zappa &quot;has every right to his opinions&quot;, McLaughlin countered Zappa&#x27;s criticism by saying &quot;he was just jealous!&quot; McLauglin was also critical of Zappa&#x27;s lead guitar skills, especially on a live setting. &quot;While I’ve always enjoyed his recordings, on tour he would take very, very long guitar solos, and he just didn’t have what it takes to play long guitar solos&quot;, said the English musician.

Former Deep Purple and Rainbow leader Ritchie Blackmore, a notoriously abrasive character, also critiqued his and friend Carlos Santana&#x27;s playing. In a 1974 interview to Cameron Crowe, Blackmore stated:
==Influence==

In 2010, Jeff Beck said: &quot;John McLaughlin has given us so many different facets of the guitar. And introduced thousands of us to world music, by blending Indian music with jazz and classical. I&#x27;d say he was the best guitarist alive.&quot; McLaughlin has been cited as a major influence on many 1970s and 1980s guitarists, including prominent players such as Steve Morse, Gary Moore, Eric Johnson, Mike Stern, Al Di Meola, Shawn Lane, Scott Henderson, and Trevor Rabin of Yes. Other players who acknowledge his influence include Omar Rodríguez-López of The Mars Volta, Paul Masvidal of Cynic, and Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan. According to Pat Metheny, McLaughlin has changed the evolution of the guitar during several of his periods of playing. The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr cites McLaughlin &quot;the greatest guitar player that&#x27;s ever lived&quot;.

McLaughlin is considered a major influence on composers in the fusion genre. In an interview with &quot;Downbeat&quot;, Chick Corea remarked that &quot;what John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. John&#x27;s band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair stand on end.&quot;

The musician and comedian Darryl Rhoades also paid tribute to McLaughlin&#x27;s influence. In the 1970s, he led the &quot;Hahavishnu Orchestra&quot;, which did parodies of the funk, rock and jazz musical styles of the era.

==Personal life==
McLaughlin was married to Eve when he was a disciple of Sri Chinmoy. For a time he lived with the French pianist Katia Labèque, who was also a member of his band in the early 1980s. As of 2017, McLaughlin is married to his fourth wife, Ina Behrend. They had a son in 1998. Since the late 1980s, he has lived in Monaco. McLaughlin is a pescetarian.

McLaughlin, alongside Behrend, supports a Palestinian music therapy organization, Al-Mada, who run a program called &quot;For My Identity I Sing&quot;. McLaughlin performed in Ramallah, Palestine, in 2012 with Zakir Hussain and in 2014 with 4th Dimension.

<doc id="328284" wikidata="Q3033553" url="?curid=328284" title="The Curse of Fatal Death">
<text>The Curse of Fatal Death is a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; special made specifically for the Red Nose Day charity telethon in the United Kingdom, and was originally broadcast in four parts on BBC One on 12 March 1999 under the title Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death. Later home video releases are formatted as two parts and drop the &quot;and&quot; in the title. It follows in a long tradition of popular British television programmes producing short, light-hearted specials for such telethon events.

It has a special status amongst &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-themed charity productions. It has twice been featured on the cover of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; – an unusual feat even for a regular episode of the programme. It is the only Comic Relief story to be covered by &quot;DWM Archives&quot;, a section of &quot;DWM&quot; normally reserved for discussion of past episodes of the regular series. Similarly, it is the only parody to be given an extensive behind-the-scenes article on the BBC official website, and its own video release through BBC Video. It is also the only BBC-commissioned live-action &quot;Doctor Who&quot; production between the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie in 1996 and &quot;Rose&quot; in 2005.

Finally, it serves as a production bridge – if not a narrative bridge – between the 1963 and 2005 versions of the programme. Most notable amongst the many connections between &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; versions is the fact that it showcases the first televised &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script by Steven Moffat, the first post-production work of The Mill on the programme, the only time a woman produced an episode of the programme between Verity Lambert and Susie Liggat, and the final performance by the longest-serving Dalek vocal artist, Roy Skelton. Executive Producer Richard Curtis later wrote the 2010 episode &quot;Vincent and the Doctor&quot;. Richard E. Grant, who plays the alternative Tenth Doctor, later appeared on the actual show as the main antagonist of the seventh series, the Great Intelligence, after performing the voice of an alternate version of the Ninth Doctor in an animated webcast serial &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;.

==Plot==
The story begins with the Master gloating over his latest scheme to destroy his nemesis. However, instead of only spying on the Doctor and his companion Emma on a giant screen, he is unaware that his microphone is on, so they hear his plans. Angry, he tries to cover up his error by gloating that of course he wanted The Doctor to know his plans, to make his revenge that much sweeter, before turning off the screen and gloating once more. However, The Master has still left the microphone on, so The Doctor still hears him gloating. The Doctor then invites his old foe to meet him at a castle on the planet Tersurus. The planet is in ruins, and was once the home of a now-extinct race of supremely-enlightened beings shunned by all because they used flatulence as their means of communication. They all died when they discovered fire.

The Master appears, gloating that he travelled a century back in time, and persuaded the architect of the castle to put in a secret death trap. The Doctor had anticipated this and travelled further back, persuading the same architect to sabotage the trap. The Master had also anticipated this, and arranged for an additional trap – with identical results because the Doctor had likewise anticipated his move. The Doctor informs the Master, having calculated that he &quot;has saved every planet in the known universe a minimum of 27 times&quot;, and having grown tired of battles with aliens and &quot;the endless gravel quarries&quot;, that he is retiring, having found a companion – Emma – with whom he has fallen in love. The Master springs yet another trap; a trap door under the Doctor&#x27;s feet leading to the vast sewers of Tersurus, which he intends to suggest to the architect after going back in time again and buying him an expensive dinner. However, the Doctor had already bought the architect that dinner, so when the Master pulls the lever, a trap door opens beneath him instead.

Seconds later, as the Doctor and Emma start to leave, the Master bursts in. Having taken him 312 years to crawl out, he emerges as an old man covered in sewage. Using his TARDIS to return to the present, he has brought allies – the Daleks (who, lacking noses, are the only race that will have anything to do with him). Additionally, he has been enhanced by superior Dalek technology, a Dalek suction-cup hand. To the Master&#x27;s dismay, he cannot answer when Emma asks him what the suction-cup is for. The Master throws himself at the Doctor but falls into the sewers again, and immediately bursts in again, another 312 years older and with a walking stick. The Daleks give chase to the Doctor, knocking the Master once more into the sewers. Having spent a total of 936 years in the sewers, he returns using a zimmer frame (walker) and is easily outpaced by the slow moving Daleks.

Emma and the Doctor are captured when they run into a room full of Daleks. Rather than being exterminated immediately, they are tied to chairs aboard the Dalek ship, the Daleks promising Emma that they &quot;will explain later&quot; as to why they even possess chairs. The Master claims he has been enhanced again with Dalek technology – rejuvenating him and adding &quot;Dalek bumps&quot; to his chest, which also act as &quot;etheric beam locators&quot;. The Doctor insults the Master, comparing the &quot;bumps&quot; to breasts. In return for his enhancements, the Master agreed to give the Daleks the Zektronic energy beam – a weapon that would &quot;allow the Daleks to conquer the universe in a matter of minutes&quot;.

When the Doctor tells the Daleks they will have to share the universe &quot;with the beard and the bosoms over there&quot;, they inform the Doctor that they plan to exterminate the Master after he has assisted them. The Doctor uses the Tersuran language (flatulence) to warn his fellow Time Lord. The Master helps the Doctor and Emma escape, but not before the Doctor is fatally injured by the Daleks. He tells Emma (in Tersuran, which the Master translates) that he loves her, then dies. The Doctor regenerates into a handsome and sexually eager new Doctor (Richard E. Grant). Forced to fix the Dalek weapon, he is also electrocuted and becomes a shy, middle-aged and overweight Doctor (Jim Broadbent). Another accident results in a handsome, smooth-mannered Doctor (Hugh Grant), but this Doctor is also accidentally killed while fixing the weapon. Due to the Zektronic energy beam&#x27;s ability to disable the regenerative process, the Doctor permanently dies. The Master vows to live a life of heroism in honour of his fallen foe&#x27;s memory, as do the Daleks.

Seemingly through the will of the universe itself, the Doctor does regenerate yet again, only this time as a woman (Joanna Lumley), who seems confused that her breasts are not etheric beam locators, despite each having an &quot;on switch&quot;. Emma is deeply disappointed, pointing out that &quot;You&#x27;re just not the man I fell in love with.&quot; The Master, however, is quite smitten with this new Doctor, who notices the sonic screwdriver (which vibrates) has &quot;&quot;three&quot; settings!&quot; The story ends with them walking off together, the Master promising to explain later as to why he is called the Master.

==Continuity==

This story is connected to a number of others by virtue of its narrative and its production elements. Many of the story&#x27;s actors also have other connections to the programme, although most of these connections take the form of various actors &quot;almost&quot; getting a role in the main production.

===Narrative===
* The planet Tersurus was first mentioned in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;, where a severely deteriorated Master, at the end of his last regeneration, was found. The spin-off novel &quot;Legacy of the Daleks&quot; by John Peel relates the events leading up to the Master&#x27;s arrival there.

===Future references to this sketch===
* The Doctor later married River Song in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, also written by Moffat. 
* The Dalek bumps worn by the Master are presumably a reference to the Time Lords&#x27; questioned ability at the time to regenerate across genders. Steven Moffat later created Missy, a female incarnation of the Master and the first Time Lord to regenerate from male to female, in &quot;Dark Water&quot;. The same happened to the Doctor in &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, in which Jodie Whittaker became the first female Doctor, as foreshadowed here by Moffat casting Joanna Lumley. Coincidentally, both played the Thirteenth Doctor.
* &quot;Never cruel or cowardly&quot;, as the Doctor is described here by Emma, was later revealed by Moffat in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; to be the &quot;promise&quot; that is made by the taking of the name &quot;The Doctor&quot;. It was used in a novel by Paul Cornell published shortly before this sketch aired, but originates from (and implicitly quotes) &quot;The Making of Doctor Who&quot; by Terrance Dicks in the 1970s. This was referenced again by the twelfth doctor, just before regeneration in &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;.

===Production===
* The title sequence is the same as used during most of the Tom Baker era of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, albeit edited to remove Tom Baker&#x27;s face.
* The opening image of the TARDIS flying through space as the Master watches was taken from the beginning of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV movie.
* Steven Moffat, best known at the time for the children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Press Gang&quot; (which starred Julia Sawalha), was well known as a fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and included many small continuity references in his script. He subsequently wrote several episodes for the series proper since its revival in 2005, starting with the two-part serial &quot;The Empty Child&quot;/&quot;The Doctor Dances&quot;, and was the programme&#x27;s head writer and executive producer between 2010 and 2017.
* The title &quot;Curse of Fatal Death&quot; is a tautology (it being impossible to have a death that is not fatal), which parodies the sometimes melodramatic and tautological titles of the original series (an example being the 1976 serial &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;).
* This is the lone example of a BBC-only production prior to 2005 in which the TARDIS interior appears to be lit when viewed from the exterior. This continues a tradition begun in the 1996 television movie, and is common practice in the 2005 series. The visual effect was first seen in the film &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot;.
* The exterior TARDIS prop was the same Mark II fibreglass version used in the 1980s and in the 30th-anniversary story &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;; &quot;Curse&quot; was the last time the prop was used.
* Other specially made episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; include &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; (1993), the officially untitled 2005 special mini-episode, and &quot;Time Crash&quot; (2007) — all produced for Children in Need — &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;:, a two-part mini-story produced for Comic Relief in 2011 and &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; (2013). &quot;Time Crash&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; and &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; were written by Moffat.
*Ironically, the main canon of the TV series would go on to feature the Doctor as a female in her thirteenth official incarnation, albeit this time portrayed by Jodie Whittaker.

====Music====
The production was deliberately based on the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s era and a conscious effort was made to use cues taken directly from episodes of that era. However, the practical unavailability of these soundtracks forced the show&#x27;s musical director, Mark Ayres, to use material mostly from the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s era. Except for the reuse of the theme music, the majority of musical cues come from episodes between &quot;Meglos&quot; and &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, with a brief excerpt also taken from the Third Doctor serial &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; as well as an excerpt from the Seventh Doctor serial &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy&quot; (written by Ayres himself). The music during the episode&#x27;s final scene, for example, is the same as that which played at the conclusion of the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration into the Fifth in &quot;Logopolis&quot;. After each regeneration portrayed in the episode, music from &quot;Meglos&quot; is employed.

===Actors===
* Richard E. Grant was later cast as the Doctor in the animated 40th-anniversary adventure &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot; in 2003, though his status was relegated to unofficial following the announcement of a new series in September 2003. He later played the villainous Great Intelligence (in its Walter Simeon persona) in 2012&#x27;s &quot;The Snowmen&quot;, and 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Bells of Saint John&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;. In the 2024 episode &quot;Rogue&quot;, Richard E. Grant&#x27;s likeness was seen in a sequence of the Doctor&#x27;s past regenerations.
* Jim Broadbent had previously played the Doctor in a sketch on &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot;, mocking the series&#x27; perceived sexism, cheapness, and use of technobabble.
* Roy Skelton had voiced Daleks since 1967.
* Julia Sawalha was being considered for the role of a new companion, a &quot;cat burglar&quot; who would have been introduced in the twenty-seventh season. Building on this, a &quot;what if&quot; article in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; #255 featured her in this role along with a hypothetical Eighth Doctor, played by Richard Griffiths, who was at one time considered for the role of the Fifth Doctor.
* Hugh Grant was offered the role of the Doctor again ahead of Christopher Eccleston, and later said publicly that he regretted dismissing it without much thought when he saw how good the series was – and that he was hoping to play a villain in the ongoing programme instead. Russell T Davies later described Hugh Grant&#x27;s performance as &quot;fleetingly&quot; one of the best performances in the part of the Doctor.
* Joanna Lumley is the first woman to play an incarnation of the Doctor. The second was Arabella Weir in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; Big Finish episode &quot;Exile&quot;. On 16 July 2017, Jodie Whittaker was revealed as the official Thirteenth Doctor, becoming the first woman to be cast in the role of the Doctor within the &quot;main&quot; series.

==Broadcast and releases==
* When originally broadcast, the title of the story was &quot;Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death&quot;. The four episodes were later re-edited into a two-part story that was released to home video a few months following broadcast, with the proceeds again donated to Comic Relief. The opening credits were remade to include Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s face. In the VHS release, the title was simply reduced to &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot;.
* The serial was rebroadcast twice on UK Gold during their 40th anniversary marathon in 2003. Used as a five-minute &quot;pause&quot; between fan-chosen episodes of the classic era, it returned to its original title and four-episode format.
* &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot; has been released digitally via iTunes (UK store only) and is available on both the Red Nose Day and Doctor Who channels on YouTube.
* Although released on VHS 6 September 1999, there have not been any plans to bring &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot; out on DVD, however BBC Worldwide have said when all the classic series DVDs have been released it may be.

<doc id="328288" wikidata="Q71724" url="?curid=328288" title="Lorient">
<text>Lorient (; ) is a town (&quot;commune&quot;) and seaport in the Morbihan department of Brittany in western France.

==History==

=== Prehistory and classical antiquity ===
Beginning around 3000 BC, settlements in the area of Lorient are attested by the presence of megalithic architecture. Ruins of Roman roads (linking Vannes to Quimper and Port-Louis to Carhaix) confirm Gallo-Roman presence.

=== Founding ===

In 1664, Jean-Baptiste Colbert founded the French East Indies Company. In June 1666, an ordinance of Louis XIV granted lands of Port-Louis to the company, along with Faouédic on the other side of the roadstead. One of its directors, Denis Langlois, bought lands at the confluence of the Scorff and the Blavet rivers, and built slipways. At first, it only served as a subsidiary of Port-Louis, where offices and warehouses were located. The following years, the operation was almost abandoned, but in 1675, during the Franco-Dutch War, the French East Indies Company scrapped its base in Le Havre since it was too exposed during wartime, and transferred its infrastructures to l&#x27;Enclot, out of which Lorient grew. The company then erected a chapel, workshops, forges, and offices, leaving Port-Louis permanently.

The city&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;Le Soleil d&#x27;Orient&quot;, the first ship constructed at the site, in 1669. Workers gave the site the name of the ship, which, by contraction, became simply &quot;L&#x27;Orient&quot; and finally &quot;Lorient&quot;.

The French Royal Navy opened a base there in 1690, under the command of Colbert de Seignelay, who inherited his father&#x27;s position as Secretary of State of the Navy. At the same time, privateers from Saint-Malo took shelter there. In 1700, the town grew out of l&#x27;Enclot following a law forcing people to leave the domain to move to the Faouédic heath. In 1702, there were about 6,000 inhabitants in Lorient, though activities slowed, and the town began to decline.

===Growth under the Company of the Indies===

The town experienced a period of growth when John Law formed the Perpetual Company of the Indies by absorbing other chartered companies (including the French East India Company), and chose Lorient as its operations base. Despite the economic bubble caused by the Company in 1720, the city was still growing as it took part in the Atlantic triangular slave trade. From 1720 to 1790, 156 ships deported an estimated 43,000 slaves. In 1732, the Company decided to transfer its sales headquarters from Nantes to Lorient, and asked architect Jacques Gabriel to raise new buildings out of dimension stones to host these new activities, and to embellish the L&#x27;Enclos domain. Sales began in 1734, peaking up to 25 million &quot;livres tournois&quot;. In 1769, the Company&#x27;s monopoly ended with the scrapping of the company itself, under the influence of the physiocrats.

Until the Company&#x27;s closure, the city took advantage of its prosperity. In 1738, there were 14,000 inhabitants, or 20,000 considering the outlying villages of Kerentrech, Merville, La Perrière, Calvin, and Keryado, which are now neighbourhoods within the present-day city limits. In 1735, new streets were laid out and in 1738, it was granted city status. Further work was undertaken as the streets began to be paved, wharves and slipways were built along the Faouédic river, and thatched houses were replaced with stone buildings following 18th-century classical architecture style as it was the case for l&#x27;Enclos. In 1744, the city walls were erected, and proved quickly useful as Lorient was raided in September 1746. Following the demise of the Company, the city lost one-seventh of its population.

In 1769, the city evolved into a full-scale naval base for the Royal Navy when the King bought out the Company&#x27;s infrastructures for 17,500,000 &quot;livres tournois&quot;. From 1775 on, the American Revolutionary War brought a surge in activity, as many privateers hailed from Lorient. When the war ended, transatlantic lines opened to the United States, and in 1785, a new commercial company started under Calonne&#x27;s tutelage (then Controller-General of Finances) with the same goal as the previous entities, i.e. conducting trade in India and China, with again Lorient standing as its operative base.

The French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars put an end to trade for nearly two decades.

=== 19th and early 20th centuries ===

Maritime activities slowed at the start of the 19th century. Activity at the shipyards and naval base reached a low that would last until the July Monarchy. During this period, the city was more of an administrative center. The first secondary school opened in 1822, a lazaretto in 1823, and barracks in 1839.

The city began to modernize in the second quarter of the century; in 1825, a roofed slipway and a drydock were added to the shipyards. A sardine cannery opened the same year. The first gasworks was built in 1845.

In the second half of the 19th century, the steam engine allowed the ports to strengthen their output. The first locomotive reached the city in 1865. In 1861, the original drydock was enlarged as a second one was dug out. The same year, the ironclad &quot;Couronne&quot; was built on a design directly inspired by the &quot;Gloire&quot; class, though unlike her wooden-hull predecessors, she was entirely made of iron. She was followed in 1876 by the ironclad &quot;Redoutable&quot;, the first ship in the world with a steel structure.

In 1889, fishing expanded following the creation of the municipal fish market, and the arrival of steam-powered fishing trawlers in 1900. The Keroman fishing port construction started in 1920.

=== World War II ===
In 1941, the Germans, then occupying France, chose to establish a U-boat base at Lorient. The submarine facilities quickly became targets of constant bombing from Allied air forces. The Germans decided to build a complex of bomb-proof submarine pens, their largest U-boat base, which would house the 2nd and the 10th U-boat flotillas for the bulk of the Battle of the Atlantic. Karl Dönitz, then supreme commander of the U-boat Arm, moved his staff into the Kernevel villa, just across the water from Keroman, in Larmor-Plage.

In 1943–1944, Lorient was nearly razed to the ground by Allied bombing, which failed to destroy the submarine pens despite 4,000 tons of bombs dropped. According to the book &quot;Steel Boats, Iron Hearts&quot; (by former crewman Hans Goebeler), after the Allies failed to damage the U-boat bunkers the bombing shifted to the city itself to deny the Germans workers and other resources. Before the bombings, thousands of leaflets were dropped on the population instructing the inhabitants to evacuate. Between 14 January 1943 and 17 February 1943, as many as 500 high-explosive aerial bombs and more than 60,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Lorient.

After the Normandy landings in June 1944 and the subsequent breakout, Lorient was surrounded by Allied troops on 12 August 1944. Its usefulness as a naval base gone, Lorient was left in a state of siege, surrounded by the French Forces of the West, supported by a US Infantry Division. On 10 May 1945, the German garrison surrendered, two days after the official final unconditional surrender of Germany. In 1949, the city of Lorient was awarded the Legion of Honour and the &quot;Croix de guerre 1939–1945&quot;.

=== Reconstruction ===
In April 1945, the Reconstruction Ministry advocated the use of temporary wooden shacks. These shelters were shipped as a kit to be built on site. In 1948, there were 28 settlements under the city&#x27;s authority, and 20 more in the urban area, distributed among the neighboring towns of Ploemeur, Lanester, Hennebont and Quéven. Each of these neighbourhoods could hold up to 280 houses. A new Hôtel de Ville (city hall) was completed in 1960.

This temporary housing would stand from 10 to 40 years depending on the location. The last shack in the largest settlement, Soye, was torn down in 1991. Today, only a few buildings dating to the 18th century still stand.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Lorient is located on the south coast of Brittany, where the rivers Scorff and Blavet join to form the roadstead of Lorient, before discharging into the Atlantic Ocean. The river Ter used to flow into the estuary to the south of the city, however, a dam was constructed in 1967, stopping the flow. The city is south-west of Paris, south-west of Rennes and north-west of Nantes.

Lorient is commonly referred to as &quot;La ville aux cinq ports&quot; (&quot;the city of five ports&quot;): military, fishing, commercial, passengers and yachting. In 2010, the sector represented 9,600 direct jobs for a total 12,000 jobs (with indirect jobs accounted for), or 12% of local employment.
* Keroman fishing port (fr): In 2010, with a catch of 27,000 tons, it was second only to Boulogne-sur-Mer regarding catch tonnage among French fishing ports, but first considering the cash value. It accounts for 3,000 jobs (including 700 fishermen) and 130 fishing vessels.
* Kergroise cargo port : With 2.6 million tons of cargo per year (including oil, cattle fodder, sand, containers), it ranks first in Brittany.
* Marinas : mooring berths are dispatched on Lorient (370), Kernevel (1,000), Port-Louis (450), Gâvres (57) and Guidel (102). Additionally, there is an long dock dedicated to offshore competitive sailing (&quot;Pôle course au large&quot;), recently built within the former submarine base.
* Passenger ships : each year, more 457,500 passengers set sail to the nearby islands of Groix and Belle-Île-en-Mer.
* Military : though no longer a French Navy base, new warships are still built at DCNS, docking temporarily on wharves along the Scorff river.

=== Industry ===
From its founding, shipbuilding has always been of great importance to the city. DCNS continues the legacy of the formerly state-owned shipyards (colloquially known as &quot;l&#x27;Arsenal&quot;) that began operation in 1690. It still builds warships, mainly frigates. There is also a substantial industrial base in Keroman to support the fishing fleet.

Lorient was the location of an extensive submarine base, built by the Germans in World War II and used subsequently by the French Navy. Head of the U-Boat Arm Karl Dönitz decided to construct the base on 28 June 1940. Between November 1940 and January 1942 a number of gigantic reinforced concrete structures were built. including three on the Keroman peninsula. They are called K1, K2 and K3. In 1944 work began on a fourth structure. The base was capable of sheltering thirty submarines. Lorient was damaged by Allied bombing raids but the naval base survived the war.
Following the German surrender the base was used by the French Navy, named for Jacques Stosskopf, a hero of the French Resistance who had worked there. The base was decommissioned in 1995 and turned over to civilian use.

<text>George M. Duke (January 12, 1946 – August 5, 2013) was an American keyboardist, composer, singer-songwriter and record producer. He worked with numerous artists as arranger, music director, writer and co-writer, record producer and as a professor of music. He first made a name for himself with the album &quot;The Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George Duke Trio&quot;. He was known primarily for 32 solo albums, of which &quot;A Brazilian Love Affair&quot; from 1979 was his most popular, as well as for his collaborations with other musicians, particularly Frank Zappa.

==Biography==
George M. Duke was born in San Rafael, California, United States, to Thadd Duke and Beatrice Burrell, and was raised in Marin City. At four years of age, he became interested in the piano. His mother took him to see Duke Ellington in concert and told him about this experience. &quot;I don&#x27;t remember it too well, but my mother told me I went crazy. I ran around saying &#x27;Get me a piano, get me a piano! He began his formal piano studies at the age of seven at a local Baptist church.

He attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley before earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in trombone and composition, with a minor in contrabass, from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official site/biography&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a master&#x27;s degree in composition from San Francisco State University in 1975.

Although Duke started playing classical music, he credited his cousin Charles Burrell for convincing him to switch to jazz. He explained that he &quot;wanted to be free&quot; and Burrell &quot;more or less made the decision for me&quot; by convincing him to &quot;improvise and do what you want to do&quot;. He taught a course on jazz and American culture at Merritt College in Oakland.

Duke recorded his first album in 1966. His second was with French violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, with whom he performed in San Francisco. After Frank Zappa and Cannonball Adderley heard him play, they invited him to join their bands. He spent two years with Zappa as a member of The Mothers of Invention, two years with Adderley, then returned to Zappa. Zappa played guitar solos on his album &quot;Feel&quot; (1974). In 1975 he recorded with Pete Magadini (his Original drummer) the album Polyrhythm on Ibis Recordings. He recorded &quot;I Love the Blues She Heard My Cry&quot; with Zappa&#x27;s bandmates Ruth Underwood, Tom Fowler, and Bruce Fowler and jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour.

Duke occasionally recorded under the name Dawilli Gonga, possibly for contractual reasons, when appearing on other artists&#x27; albums.
In 1977, Duke fused jazz with pop, funk, and soul music on his album &quot;From Me to You&quot;. Later, that same year, his album &quot;Reach for It&quot; entered the pop charts, and his audiences increased. 
In 1981, he began a collaboration with bassist Stanley Clarke that would last through the 1980s, which combined pop, jazz, funk, and R&amp;B. Their first album contained the single &quot;Sweet Baby&quot;, which became a Top 20 pop hit, reaching Number 19 on the Billboard Magazine Hot 100 and Number 6 on the R &amp; B charts.

During the 1980s, Duke&#x27;s career moved to a second phase as he spent much of his time as a record producer. He produced pop and R&amp;B hits for A Taste of Honey, Jeffrey Osborne, and Deniece Williams. His clients included Anita Baker, Rachelle Ferrell, Everette Harp, Gladys Knight, Melissa Manchester, Barry Manilow, The Pointer Sisters, Smokey Robinson, Seawind, and Take 6.

Duke worked as musical director at the 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in London. In 1989, he temporarily replaced Marcus Miller as musical director of NBC&#x27;s late-night music performance program &quot;Sunday Night&quot; during its first season. He was a judge for the second annual Independent Music Awards.

He died on August 5, 2013, in Los Angeles, at the age of 67 from chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Per Japanese census data, the population of Ōdate peaked in the 1960s and has been in decline since then.

==History==
The area of present-day Ōdate was part of ancient Dewa Province, and numerous Jomon period ruins have been found within city limits. Populated by Emishi tribes, it remained outside of the control of the Yamato court until well into the Heian period. The first mention of &quot;Hinai&quot;, the area of central Ōdate is in the &quot;Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku&quot; in an article on the Gangyo War of 878, in which Hinai is listed as one of the villages under the control of Akita Castle. During the Edo period, the area came under the control of the Satake clan, who ruled the northern third of the province from Kubota Domain, and who maintained a secondary fortification at Ōdate Castle. The castle was destroyed during the Boshin War. .

After the start of the Meiji period, the area became part of Kitaakita District, Akita Prefecture in 1878. The town of Ōdate was established on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. During the Meiji period, the discovery of &quot;black ore&quot; (sphalerite and galena - a mixture of zinc, lead, gold, silver, and other precious metals), led to the development of numerous mines in the area, including the Hanaoka mine; however, the deposits were depleted by the mid-Shōwa period.

Ōdate was raised to city status on April 1, 1951. On June 20, 2005, the towns of Hinai and Tashiro (both from Kitaakita District) were merged into Ōdate, almost doubling the city&#x27;s area.

<text>David Byrne SC (born 6 April 1947) is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician and barrister who served as Chancellor of Dublin City University from 2006 to 2011, European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection from 1999 to 2004 and the Attorney General of Ireland from 1997 to 1999.

==Early life and career==
Byrne was born in Monasterevin, County Kildare, in 1947. He was educated at Newbridge College, County Kildare, University College Dublin, and King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin. He was called to the Bar in 1970, and practiced law in the Irish and European Courts. During his student days in Dublin, he founded the Free Legal Advice Centre, a student-run organisation providing legal aid to citizens in association with the legal profession. He campaigned in favour of Irish entry into the European Community in the 1970s, and has been a keen supporter of European integration ever since.

Byrne became a Senior Counsel in 1985. He practised in both the Irish courts and the European Court of Justice, and also served as a member of the International Court of Commercial Arbitration from 1990 to 1997.

In 1997, Byrne became Attorney General of Ireland in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition government. As one of the negotiators of the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998, he drafted and oversaw the major constitutional amendments required by that agreement, which were approved by Referendum in May 1998. Byrne also advised on the constitutional amendments necessary for Ireland&#x27;s ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty. During his tenure, he established the first independent Food Safety Agency in Europe responsible to the Minister of Health.

===European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection===
Byrne was nominated to the European Commission by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in September 1999, serving as Ireland&#x27;s EU Commissioner, and had responsibility for Health and Consumer Protection in the Prodi Commission. He continued in that role until replaced as Ireland&#x27;s Commissioner by Charlie McCreevy in 2004.

During his time in office, Byrne was a major driving force behind European tobacco control legislation, such as directives banning tobacco advertising and regulating tobacco products, in keeping with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Under his leadership, the European Union also created the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in 2004.

==World Health Organization==
When he concluded his Brussels assignment, Byrne acted as WHO Special Envoy on the revision of the International Health Regulations for a six-month period following a series of outbreaks of SARS and avian influenza.

Byrne was mooted as a potential candidate for the position of Director General of the World Health Organization following the death of the incumbent, Lee Jong-wook in 2006. However, he was eventually not included in the list of 13 candidates to head the agency.

==Life after politics==
After leaving the European Commission, Byrne has held a variety of paid and unpaid positions, including the following:
* European Alliance for Personalised Medicine, Co-Chair
* FleishmanHillard, Member of the International Advisory Board
* Health First Europe (HFE), Patron
* International Prevention Research Institute (iPRI), Chairman of the Ethics Committee
* National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), Chairman of the Advisory Committee
* Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, Of counsel
* World Justice Project, Honorary Co-Chair
* World Prevention Alliance, Honorary Chair Member

<text>is a city located in Akita Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 41,404 in 17551 households and a population density of 52 persons per km2. The total area of the city is . Yuzawa claims to be the birthplace of the famous Heian period poet Ono no Komachi.

==Geography==
Yuzawa is located at the far southeast corner of Akita Prefecture in the southern part of the Yokote Basin, sandwiched between the Ōu Mountains to the east and the Dewa Mountains to the west. It has a lot of snow in winter, so the entire area is designated as a special heavy snowfall area. The urban area is located in the south of the Yokote Basin, and spreads out in the alluvial fan of the Kaneuchisawa River on the eastern side of the Omono River.

===Climate===
Yuzawa has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) with large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is heaviest from August to October. The average annual temperature in Yuzawa is . The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

==Demographics==
Japanese census data, the population of Yuzawa peaked in the 1950s and has declined since. The city is now smaller than it was a century ago.

==History==
The area of present-day Yuzawa was part of ancient Ugo Province, dominated by the Satake clan during the Edo period, who ruled Kubota Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. Much of the territory was part of the 20,000 &quot;koku&quot; subsidiary feudal domain of .

After the start of the Meiji period, Iwasaki Domain became briefly “Iwasaki Prefecture”, before becoming Ogachi District, Akita Prefecture in 1878. The towns of Iwasaki and Yuzawa were created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, becoming the city of Yuzawa on March 31, 1954.

On March 22, 2005, the towns of Inakawa, Minase and Ogachi (all from Ogachi District) were merged into Yuzawa.

==Government==

Yuzawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members. The city (together with the towns and villages of Ogachi District) contributes three members to the Akita Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Akita District 3 of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

=== Elections ===
* 2005 Yuzawa mayoral election

==Economy==
The economy of Yuzawa is based on agriculture, primarily rice cultivation, and the brewing of &quot;sake.&quot; The production of &quot;sake&quot; in Yuzawa accounts for about 70% of the total amount in Akita prefecture and the city positions &quot;sake&quot; brewing as one of the key industries. &quot;Sake&quot; brewing in Yuzawa had been known through the Edo period since the area included Innai Silver Mine, a large consumption area comparable to the &quot;jōkamachi&quot; of Kubota Domain. At its highest, it had more than 20 breweries and some still operate to this day.

==Education==
Yuzawa has six public elementary schools and six public middle schools operated by the city government and two public high schools operated by the Akita Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

==Media==
FM Yutopia (JOZZ2AN-FM) is the only radio station located in Yuzawa. It is known as the second oldest community radio station in Akita Prefecture, airing on Feb 2, 1999.

<doc id="328305" wikidata="Q2448621" url="?curid=328305" title="Trampoline (computing)">
<text>In computer programming, the word trampoline has a number of meanings, and is generally associated with jump instructions (i.e. moving to different code paths).

==Low-level programming==
Trampolines (sometimes referred to as indirect jump vectors) are memory locations holding addresses pointing to interrupt service routines, I/O routines, etc. Execution jumps into the trampoline and then immediately jumps out, or bounces, hence the term &quot;trampoline&quot;. They have many uses:

* Trampoline can be used to overcome the limitations imposed by a central processing unit (CPU) architecture that expects to always find vectors in fixed locations.
* When an operating system is booted on a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) machine, only one processor, the bootstrap processor, will be active. After the operating system has configured itself, it will instruct the other processors to jump to a piece of trampoline code that will initialize the processors and wait for the operating system to start scheduling threads on them.

==High-level programming==
* As used in some Lisp implementations, a trampoline is a loop that iteratively invokes thunk-returning functions (continuation-passing style). A single trampoline suffices to express all control transfers of a program; a program so expressed is trampolined, or in &quot;trampolined style&quot;; converting a program to trampolined style is trampolining. Programmers can use trampolined functions to implement tail-recursive function calls in stack-oriented programming languages.
* In Java, &quot;trampoline&quot; refers to using reflection to avoid using inner classes, for example in event listeners. The time overhead of a reflection call is traded for the space overhead of an inner class. Trampolines in Java usually involve the creation of a &quot;GenericListener&quot; to pass events to an outer class.
* In Mono Runtime, trampolines are small, hand-written pieces of assembly code used to perform various tasks.
* When interfacing pieces of code with incompatible calling conventions, a trampoline is used to convert the caller&#x27;s convention into the callee&#x27;s convention.
** In embedded systems, trampolines are short snippets of code that start up other snippets of code. For example, rather than write interrupt handlers entirely in assembly language, another option is to write interrupt handlers mostly in C, and use a short trampoline to convert the assembly-language interrupt calling convention into the C calling convention.
** When passing a callback to a system that expects to call a C function, but one wants it to execute the method of a particular instance of a class written in C++, one uses a short &quot;trampoline&quot; to convert the C function-calling convention to the C++ method-calling convention. One way of writing such a trampoline is to use a thunk. Another method is to use a &quot;generic listener&quot;.
* In Objective-C, a trampoline is an object returned by a method that captures and reifies all messages sent to it and then &quot;bounces&quot; those messages on to another object, for example in higher order messaging.
* In the GCC compiler, trampoline refers to a technique for implementing pointers to nested functions when codice_1 option is enabled. The trampoline is a small piece of code which is constructed on the fly on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken. The trampoline sets up the static link pointer, which allows the nested function to access local variables of the enclosing function. The function pointer is then simply the address of the trampoline. This avoids having to use &quot;fat&quot; function pointers for nested functions which carry both the code address and the static link. This, however, conflicts with the desire to make the stack non-executable for security reasons.
* In the esoteric programming language Befunge, a trampoline is an instruction to skip the next cell in the control flow.

==No-execute stacks==
Some implementations of trampolines cause a loss of no-execute stacks (NX stack). In the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) in particular, a nested function builds a trampoline on the stack at runtime, and then calls the nested function through the data on stack. The trampoline requires the stack to be executable.

No-execute stacks and nested functions are mutually exclusive under GCC. If a nested function is used in the development of a program, then the NX stack is silently lost. GCC offers the codice_2 warning to alert of the condition.

Software engineered using secure development lifecycle often do not allow the use of nested functions due to the loss of NX stacks.

=== The Mountain Spirit ===
Tsuruoka is mostly known for its &quot;Three Mountains of Dewa&quot;, which refers to Mt. Haguro, the smallest mount that culminates at only 436m high; Mt. Gassan, the highest mount at 1984m; and Mt. Yudono, at 1500m.

==== Yamabushi and Shugendô ====
Those three mounts are considered the core of the Shugendô practice. Shugendô (修験道, lit. &quot;The way of the ascetic practice&quot;) is often perceived as a form of syncretism of Shintô and Buddhism. The &quot;Yamabushi&quot; (山伏, lit. &quot;the men who sleep in the Mountain&quot;), or men who practice &quot;shugendô&quot;, believe in Buddha but also believe that a god resides in all things that exist in nature. Yamabushi wear checkered vests and blow trumpet shells to communicate with their peers and to keep the bad spirits away. They aim to protect the mountain and to live a sinless life connected to nature.

The pilgrimage of all three mountains is done in that sense. The three mountains symbolically represent death and rebirth. By going down and up the 2466 stone stairs of Mt. Haguro, people can experience a symbolic &quot;death&quot; and &quot;rebirth&quot;, after which they can access to the world of the dead represented by Mt. Gassan and its foggy landscapes; lastly, they can purify their body and soul in Mt. Yudono&#x27;s natural hotsprings. 

&quot;Shôjin ryôri&quot; (精進料理, lit. &quot;food for spiritual elevation&quot;), a vegan food traditionally consumed by Yamabushi, uses no animal product but &quot;sansai&quot; 山菜 (&quot;Mountain vegetables&quot;) instead, as well as local rice, handmade &quot;gomadôfu&quot; (sesame-flavoured tôfu), bamboo sprouts, vinegared chrysanthemum flowers and mushrooms. There exists many different types of &quot;shôjin ryôri&quot; depending on the shukubo (temples that also welcome travellers for the night) that serves it, but it usually consists of many small dishes accompanied with miso soup and white rice.

==== National Treasures ====
Mt. Haguro hosts The Five-Storied Pagoda (&quot;gojûnotô&quot; 五重塔), one of Japan&#x27;s National Treasures. The pagoda&#x27;s central pillar protects it from earthquakes, which inspired Tokyo&#x27;s Skytree&#x27;s architecture. Also in the grounds of Mt. Haguro is the Jiji-sugi 爺杉 (&quot;Grandpa cedar&quot;), a 30m high cedar that exists for more than 1000 years.

===Culinary culture===
==== Heritage and creativity ====
In 2014, Tsuruoka has been registered as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. Its more than 50 species of &quot;ancestral food&quot; (&quot;zairai sakumotsu&quot; 在来作物) that exist and remain intact for several centuries now are one of the reasons why the city has received this title. Among these there are: &quot;minden nasu&quot; 民田なす (a round eggplant with a long and thin hat), からとりいも (spiciness-sweetener potato), 温海かぶ (Atsumi turnip, a red turnip that grows on sharp slopes), &quot;ootaki carrot&quot; 大滝ニンジン, etc. The presence of such ancient food is not the only reason why Tsuruoka has been registered as a Creative City of Gastronomy. Its particular way to cook these ingredients was even more determinant. Tsuruoka&#x27;s most known specialties are: &quot;kandarajiru&quot; 寒鱈汁 (a soup containing black cod fished during the winter – the period when it is supposed to be tastier), &quot;gomadôfu&quot; ごま豆腐 (sesame-flavoured tôfu), &quot;tochimochi&quot; とちもち (chestnut flavoured pound rice cake), &quot;kitsunemen&quot; キツネ面 (fox mask shaped black sugar biscuit), etc.

The city is also known for its large variety of soups (it is said the harsh cold during the winter is the reason why there are so many types of hot soups in Tsuruoka), apart from &quot;kandarajiru&quot;, there is &quot;takenokojiru&quot; タケノコ汁 (Mt Gassan bamboo soup), &quot;imoni&quot; 芋煮 (potato soup), &quot;nattôjiru&quot; 納豆汁 (nattô based soup), &quot;môsô jiru&quot; (another type of bamboo soup).

==== Peas ====
Tsuruoka is known for (だだちゃ豆), a species of soybean, which have been called &quot;the king of edamame&quot;; they are also used for other products such as nattō and in manjū. There are two theories as to the origin of the name: one is that it derives from , the Shonai dialectical word for &quot;father&quot; – is the dialectical word for &quot;mother&quot;, while the other is that the beans came from Date, Fukushima, and were originally called , which became and then .

 are used in any kind of meal: sweet, salty, spicy, bitter, sour, just boiled, crushed, grilled, and in sauces.

&quot;Dadakko&quot; (だだっ子), are small cakes which contain a sweet paste. &quot;Dadappai (&quot;だだっパイ) are small pasted inside a puff pastry. There are also flavored ice creams, cookies, biscuits, creams.

==== Seafood ====
Tsuruoka and the whole region of Shônai benefit from a large variety of fishes and sea food coming from the Sea of Japan. Among all the local sea foods you can find in Tsuruoka, there are: Cherry salmon, Japanese seabream, blue crab, littlemouth flounder, flatfish, black rockfish, tonguefish, flying squid, oyster, sea robin, sandfish, Japanese codfish, and others. The huge variety of fresh local fishes and seafood in Tsuruoka had contributed to the local sushi shops&#x27; good reputation, but it has also helped constitute a very particular kind of &quot;family gastronomy&quot;, where fishes hold a very important place.

==== Rice ====
The rice cultivated in Tsuruoka and more generally in Shonai region has been recognized for its strong umami taste. In 2010, searchers from Keiô University&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Biosciences 慶應義塾大学先端生命科学研究所 have proven Tsuyahime local rice brand contained 1.5x more umami taste than the common other brands of rice thanks to the studies of metabolomes.

=== Arts and crafts ===
The city is literally surrounded by plains, forests and mountains. Thus, wood and grass were largely used in all kinds of crafts. As for architecture, thatch-roofed houses (&quot;kayabukiyane&quot; かやぶき屋根) are one of the symbols of the city. Some of them remained in good condition through centuries now as for example &quot;Tasôminka&quot; 多層民家 (the several-layered house), a traditional farmer house from Meiji period, and the house in Chidô Museum 致道博物館.

Concerning clothing, &quot;shinaori&quot; しな織り, is a traditional weaving style from tree bark that is still performed these days. The items created with this solid and firm thread are very resistant and waterproof.

==Demographics==
According to Japanese census data, the population of Sakata has declined in recent decades.

==History==
The area of present-day Sakata was the location of the provincial capital of ancient Dewa Province, although the precise location has yet to be discovered by archaeologists. A port at the mouth of the Mogami River is known to have existed since the Kamakura period. Although silting rendered it less important in the Muromachi period, the area developed as a major center for the coastal trade during the Edo period. By the early Meiji period, the Honma clan, a local merchant clan, dominated trade and emerged as the largest landholder in Japan. Traces of their powerful influence on Sakata City can still be seen across the city. This includes the Honma Museum and The Honma Gardens located in the downtown area.
With the establishment of the modern municipalities system after the start of the Meiji period, the area was organized as Sakata Town under Akumi District, Yamagata Prefecture in 1878. Approximately 80% of the town was destroyed by the 1894 Shōnai earthquake and subsequent fires. The modern city of Sakata was founded on April 1, 1933.

===World War II===
The city largely escaped damage during World War II, save for a lone air raid on its port district on August 10, 1945, which left 30 people dead or missing.

On September 20, 1944, over 200 British prisoners of war transfer to the newly created POW camp, known officially as Sakata Branch Camp (Sendai 9-B). The British would later be joined by American, Dutch and Australian POW&#x27;s. The camp was liberated in September 1945. The camp was originally established as Tokyo 22B, jurisdictional transferred to Sendai on April 14, 1945. The camp roster included:

* 15 Americans, no deaths
* 248 British, 13 deceased
* 5 Dutch, no deaths
* 26 Australians, 5 deceased

Most of the POW&#x27;s were transferred from camps in the Osaka and Tokyo area and many had survived the sinking of the steamships and . The men were used as forced labor at the Port of Sakata and some worked for Nittsu, also known as Nippon Express, still operating in Japan today.

===After World War II===
On October 29, 1976, Sakata suffered from a major fire which gutted 22.5 hectares of its city center, destroying 1,774 buildings and injuring 964 people (and one fatality).

On November 1, 2005, the towns of Hirata, Matsuyama, and Yawata (all from Akumi District) were merged into Sakata.

==Government==

In terms of national politics, the city is part of Yamagata District 3 of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Sakata is based on light manufacturing, agriculture, and commercial fishing. The Sakata Kyodo Thermal Power Station is a fossil-fueled power station operated by a joint venture of Tohoku Electric and Sumitomo Aluminum in the city.
